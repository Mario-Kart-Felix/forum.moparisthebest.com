              <p>There hasn’t been any activity to speak of here in a few years now, I’m considering archiving the forums as static HTML and shutting down discourse.</p>
<p>It’s been a great run and we still have a very active community on IRC at <a>irc.moparisthebest.com</a> TLS port 6697 <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, please join! (<a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/kiwi/" rel="nofollow noopener">webchat</a>)</p>
<p>If you want to say anything or leave any contact details feel free, I’ll also put the link here to the GitHub repo the static site will live in so if you come by after it’s converted you can still comment via pull request.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything and remember, hold on to your butts!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m an absolute noob at this kinda stuff. I’m desperate for some help/guidance on how I can begin to document a protocol. My long term goal is to MITM the APK which will run from an emulator on my PC so that I can document a running game.</p>
<p>I am willing to pay BTC if someone will spend some time looking at it and pointing me in the right direction.</p>
<p>I have considered decompiling the java files in the APK but then a bunch is also written in Lua and Luadec won’t decompile it as they’ve done some kind of encoding on the binary. (I know that I could find the function and write it+key into Luadec perhaps and do it that way, but it seems alot of work)</p>
<p>I have already seen some 3rd party applications that are doing similar things to what I want to do, however they are using winpcap and sniffing packets. Same effect though I guess. The thing they do all have in common is that before they can interpret the packets you MUST relogin to your account within the app. I’m guessing there is some form of key or something that needs pulling from the login packet.</p>
<p>As I say anyone that can help me get past the big hurdles (even figuring out wtf happens in this login packet and how to decrypt/decode future packets) I will pay.</p>
<p>I’ve attached 2 example wireshark dumps and also a link to the APK.</p>
<p>For the dumps I logged in, watched a game that was in progress and logged back out.</p>
<p>Dump 1: <a href="https://ufile.io/myxba" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ufile.io/myxba</a><br>
Dump 2: <a href="https://ufile.io/7owly" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ufile.io/7owly</a><br>
APK: <a href="http://www.pokermaster.com/en/download/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.pokermaster.com/en/download/index.html</a></p>
<p>The app is a poker app for android. I have an account someone can use if you are happy to help.</p>
<p>Anyone that can look at the dumps and point me in the right direction please please do.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>I used to use your wonderful community a long time ago (under the name dragonfire455) around the time when I was 15.</p>
<p>I’ve always loved your community and how you managed to build it into what it is today.</p>
<p>I won’t lie, I was a kid and I acted hella retarded. That’s no excuse, however it is for that reason I humbly request that my account and my posts be purged from your site.</p>
<p>I don’t have access to my old email (<a href="mailto:dragonfire455@yahoo.com">dragonfire455@yahoo.com</a>) but is there any way you could help me? I know it has been a long time, but I would just like to be forgotten. I hope you understand where I’m coming from, and that you have a wonderful day.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I have a client sided app (no server involved) and during testing came across a couple issues regarding hacking.</p>
<p>There is a conceptual membership model and you’re a member if you have got days added to your account.</p>
<p>Doing some really trivial coding and using cheat engine you can modify the number of days you have on your account so in sense call it a membership hack.</p>
<p>To prevent this pragmatically is the following code acceptable?:</p>
<p>Current:<br>
int days;<br>
boolean isMember() {<br>
return days &gt; 0;<br>
}</p>
<p>The new, updated method:</p>
<pre><code> int days;
 boolean member;

 boolean isMember() { return member; }

 void increment(int days) {
    if (days &lt;= 0) return; 

    this.days += days;
    member = true;
 }

 void decrement(int days) {
    if (days &lt;= 0) return;

    if ((this.days - days) &gt; 0) {
       this.days -= days;
    } else {
       this.days = 0; 
       member = false;
    } 
 }
</code></pre>
<p>I don’t think people will be able to modify that boolean using any sort of memory hacking (near impossible, I think).</p>
<p>Is that type of coding style okay? Is there another way I should handle it?</p>
<p>Also in the case, you could change the member, what then? Create a thread that automatically rolls back changes that have been unintentionally performed? (seems bad, but a solution). If it was Java, what’s stopping reflection clients calling the increment method themselves (unless I do some clever redesign)?</p>
<p>All of these mentioned have failed me from going into production.</p>
<p>And any other general tips would be nice.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I’ve already been researching the Dalvic Virtual Machine, so I hope it gets ported to Android. I noticed a couple of weeks back that they were going to make the switch to mobile when I started a new account for the first time in years and it reminded me of a mobile game I played called “Celtic Heroes”. Everything was in place for the switch to mobile and now it’s official.</p>
<p>I’m going to start on an apk to Java source code decompiler using either ANTLR or just building it from scratch. Hopefully we get to see some new fresh things and maybe it’ll revive the community.

              <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I’m designing the backend for my app and had a couple of ideas that I wanted to talk you guys about.</p>
<p>Everything is going to be related to Java:</p>
<p>So the bare basics of programming would tell you that a class is a blueprint e.g. a Person class would describe a person. Nothing more, right?</p>
<p>Let’s think of a game more specifically RSPS (since we all love those) - The typical Player.java may contain some unrelated Player code such as a reference to a Socket or methods to send the user information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this not violate the concept of what a player should be?</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff like Apollo and Scapeemulator do this. In fact, what is this Player.java class really suppose to be doing? <a href="https://github.com/apollo-rsps/apollo/blob/master/game/src/main/org/apollo/game/model/entity/Player.java" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/apollo-rsps/apollo/blob/master/game/src/main/org/apollo/game/model/entity/Player.java</a></p>
<p>Seems like a lot going on for a class that is supposed to just model a Player.</p>
<p>Now what I think the correct approach would be is to have the player class actually define a player and nothing else e.g.</p>
<p>class Player { String name; String health; String runEnergy; }</p>
<p>Then have some other entity dealing with player updating, network calls etc. In regards to “how would we then send a player messages?” Maybe a map or a repo? Be creative <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Going a little deeper into the core of a rsps, let’s talk about how some people implement networking (example).<br>
When I was using Scapeemulator, I wanted to swap the networking library (that does the job a little better for what I wanted). I couldn’t, netty was everywhere making it impossible to do what I wanted.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about writing lightweight wrappers or strictly private modules? Maybe?</p>
<p>Hopefully, you guys could give a novice like me some advice on how I should be coding <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              Questions about RSPS coding




<h1>RSPS Coding</h1>
<h2>Trying to understand the basics</h2>
<aside>I would like to post a topic to try and find out some information about RSPS resources and coding</aside>




<h3>Clients &amp; Source</h3>
<p>Back when I used to have my own Dodian with a peak of <em>10 players</em>,<br>
Servers and clients were easy to find, the links were new and they weren't all outdated, so I have a couple of questions.</p>
<h4>Where can people find updated Links for Clients and Sources</h4>
<p>Let's say you have a benchmark for a server, you know what revision you want, you want it to be functional<br>
<strong>Where would you go?</strong></p>
<h4>You have errors?</h4>
<p>When coding, if you're like me, sometimes you're not always paying the most attention or paying to much attention and can't figure a problem out.<br>
<strong>What resources are there to help people out</strong>?</p>


<h3>Learning to code</h3>
<p>When learning to code, there's no real good foundation to start on, I know that and have been told that.<br>
But I was wondering if there were any threads that you recommend that people look into if they are interested</p>

<p>This week on Pedant blog, we take a look at this awful clickbait-esqe image I found on Facebook.</p>
<p>In this most likely made up story, the “dumb blonde” rhetoric is used for comedic effect; her alternative “simple” interpretation of the password restriction results in the creation of a strong password, in a ironic fashion. But, what if, she understood these restrictions when she read them and coincidentally chose the mentioned password. The password contains more than 8 characters and several capital letters - her statement is logically correct both when referring to glyphs and Disney characters/US state capitals.</p>
<p>Maybe this employee was well aware of the restrictions, recognised the “joke” in the password restriction and formed this satirical password for her own <strong>personal</strong> amusement, not expecting anyone to question her decision.</p>
<p>After pondering away at these possibilities, the real joke emerges - this employee just took part in a “Password Audit”. The fact that her own company knows her password undermines the whole idea of a “Password Audit” - her I.D. is clearly not safe if her employer can see it in plaintext.</p>
<p>The creator of this image is either incredibly stupid, or an absolute genius - 10/10.</p>
