              <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Are any of you working on a bot, or private scripts for one of the public bots, that has successfully leveled an account in OSRS?<br>
I was taking a look at a few of the free bots yesterday wondering if it was worthwhile writing scripts for them.</p>
<p>A bit of discussion indicates that some people are having success with private scripts, while those using public scripts are pretty much shit out of luck and likely banned within two or three days.</p>
<p>So yeah, does anyone have any thoughts on this?</p>

<p>After getting my A+ and Net+ and being hired in a full time tech support position, I am now going to start studying for the Linux+, which is a great cert, since it also gives you the LPIC1 and the Novell Certified Linux Administrator Certification (it’s a three-in-one cert).</p>

              <p>I am curious if any of you have taken the CompTIA A+ Certification. I’ve been doing some practice tests, filling in some gaps in my knowledge (IRQ codes, printer repair, and other things that I don’t use on an everyday basis) and I am getting to the point where I am confident and ready to take this exam.</p>
<p>Do you have your A+ certification? How difficult was the exam? If you work in IT, and you don’t have this certification, does it matter, if you know what you’re doing? Any thoughts are appreciated.</p>

<p>Honorable and intelligent guy. He doesn’t necessarily stick out far in terms of unique developments but he has will to learn and is a very respectable member of the community. He’s been around for awhile and I think he’d be a good addition to the veteran section.</p>

              <p>So I’m trying to get back into programming (took a 4-5 month break), and starting off with a game. I don’t think I’ll finish it, it’s a lot of work, but I still want to work on it.</p>
<p>So I have a question about the most efficient way of rendering a 2d tile based game. If you have any insight I’d love to hear your opinions.</p>
<p>For example, for drawing the map, which would be better?</p>
<ol>
<li>Have the map be one image. Either saved as an image or created as an image when the map file is loaded. To render map, just show a portion of that image.</li>
<li>Create an image for the current viewport of the map every time the map is moved or updated, and draw that</li>
<li>Draw the map tile by tile</li>
</ol>
<p>Drawing it tile by tile makes it easier to draw entities, but Im not sure if it’s as efficient.</p>

              <p>To provoke some discussion, I wanted to bring this up: I know a lot (if not all) of the members here don’t use the IRC. I know the prospect of a chatbox for the forum has been brought up in the past but shot down by people proclaiming that everyone can use the IRC client with ease, so I’m sort of wondering why nobody here uses the IRC and whether you guys think providing some kind of chatbox would be a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>My current thoughts on the matter are that we should update the horrible client on the IRC CHAT tab, to a more sleek and updated one which would hopefully provide a nicer GUI, rather than that clunky blue applet that currently resides on the page. The other thing I wanted to bring up was the potential for an extra forum theme, this was brought up in a recent staff meeting and the consensus for such an addition was simple: If it has enough support, and isn’t anything silly then it can be added and maintained. What do you guys think about this prospect? And do you have any theme suggestions, right now there is only the one that Frell suggested that I could remember:</p>
<p><a href="http://custom.simplemachines.org/themes/index.php?lemma=2600" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://custom.simplemachines.org/themes/index.php?lemma=2600</a></p>
<p>There was also the greenfox theme from a while back, but I can’t remember the name explicitly. I want to have a set of clear and concise themes to present for a potential vote topic. The board has sort of gone into deadlock, and I’m primarily to blame because I haven’t really paid much time into it as of late, but as I said in the sticky you’re allowed to discuss pretty much anything here, within reason, and I’d be happy to hear your input.</p>

Staff and MSCP CMs can view this board, so they can collaborate their views and knowledge to make a well informed decision. You should look at the following (as guidelines) when discussing a member:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Maturity[/li]<br>
[li]High post quality[/li]<br>
[li]Longevity[/li]<br>
[li]Their behavior on the forum in general, such as infraction log, and linked accounts.[/li]<br>
[li]Activity[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I’d rather not have elitist attitude people in here, at all. As explained in the main sticky, this board should have a pretty high standard. Now that we don’t have a reputation system there is now quantitative way to decide who gets access, so we must take a more qualitative approach to deciding. Please don’t broadcast this board, the user shouldn’t really know they’re under consideration.</p>

              <p>This board is visible to Moparscape CMs only, and of course administrators. This may change as this board is still developing, so at some point staff may be able to view the board and so on. The idea behind Moparscape CM is so the more outstanding, and mature members of the forum with a good record can come together and be recognized, it’s sort of like what MITB CM used to be, a mature group of members who the rest of the forum aspire to be like in different ways.</p>
<p>You can discuss anything you feel relevant in this board, general discussion, forum changes, and even potential additions for the Moparscape CM rank. I want to experiment with who can view this board, and tweak it until we have a setting that is most optimal. There are a few things that are expected of members here:</p>
<p>[ol][li]By no means is this rank a ticket for elevating yourselves above other members, if you go around blatantly breaking the forum rules you will be infracted on a level more serious than a normal member would. You should know much better by now, please don’t let the rank down and yourselves. If a member becomes a serious problem they will simply be removed from here with no questions asked. [/li]<br>
[li]While I can’t demand you all be perfect, because nobody is perfect. I would like to ask you try your best to uphold moparscape as a nice community, this rank shouldnt be used to emulate what MITB CM has become, and I will not allow it to become what MITB CM is. [/li][/ol]</p>

              <p>I know drug topics here are typically about party drugs, but I figured I’d post anyway.</p>
<p>I’m interested in the efficacy of antidepressants, and whether it’s worth my while to go to a doctor to obtain them. I already know that the research conclusions are somewhat mixed, so I’m doing the reverse of what I’d usually do by seeking anecdotal evidence. By the very nature of anecdotal evidence, posting this topic is probably an act of futility. It does serve to get something off my chest though, if nothing else.</p>
<p>Back story: Approaching mid twenties, perpetually single. I’ve been pretty down for a while because of this… It’s hard being in your twenties and not feeling at least a little defective when you’ve never had any kind of intimacy with anyone. This part has been going on for years, and it’s perpetuating. I’ve lost count of how many people I’ve alienated, but I doubt any of them hate me as much as I do.<br>
I had a moment of clarity a while ago and realised that, a handful of people notwithstanding, I know little about any of my friends beyond their name and the superficial stuff you discover about a person on social media sites.</p>
<p>Today I learned that the company I work for is likely to be liquidated in the next few weeks, and my coworkers and I have been made part time effective next week. As far as I’m concerned, there couldn’t be a worse time for this because a lot of companies currently have hiring freezes in place.</p>
<p>We have social security in Australia, but I have liquid assets (my home loan savings) which are reasonably substantial in my view (and in the view of our social security system). As it stands, the worst case scenario is that I would have to go between three and four months before receiving any assistance.<br>
I’m hoping it doesn’t come to that, but I haven’t had any luck finding jobs that I’m qualified for yet. My home savings are literally the only thing I have to show for myself, so it’s upsetting to know that in the worst case it will be eroded to some extent.</p>
<p>Additionally, my coworkers and I have not received superannuation payments (superannuation is basically a pension plan) over the course of our employment. More fool me for not kicking up a shit about it earlier, but it’s too late now.<br>
The liquidator and secured creditors are paid first when a company enters liquidation, before employees, and there’s over 25k of debt on the company’s credit card account. In terms of assets though, I suspect the most valuable is the company car (my boss’ 1999 Celica, probably worth 5k at most). I know the car and contents of our office isn’t going to wipe out None of us are going to see our superannuation.</p>
<p>So yeah, now I’m stressed about my financial position.</p>
<p>Have any of you done the whole depression -&gt; treatment -&gt; recovery process? Was it effective?</p>
<p>tl;dr: Forever alone, soon to be out of a job when quite a few companies allegedly have hiring freezes, and stressed/anxious as a result.</p>
