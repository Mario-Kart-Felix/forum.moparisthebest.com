              <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I have an android phone and it’s running Android version 6.0.<br>
There’s a been an issue I’ve been having and I want to know if others have had this issue?</p>
<p>Something apps would leave a “shadow” or watermark type print on my phone. E.g. I was once using chrome and the website (moparscape) + a few of chromes buttons like got imprinted on to my desktop wallpaper. When I switch users, it’s fine the mark goes. If I change wallpapers the mark stays. I blamed Dr House (quietly) and factory reset my phone.</p>
<p>I guess Dr House was not the blame because it happened again but this time with snapchat! I can see bits of the snapchat app on my background but this time it’s like a mark on my camera. When I load my camera app, I can see a shadow of Snapchat in the background. It’s not leaving a mark on my pictures though. Simple reboots do not fix this. When I screenshot, the shadow is not there either.</p>
<p>Have you guys had this issue or heard of it? The phone I have is LG v10</p>
<p>Help meeee <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>I use to use CentOS 6 to host my Runescape Classic server. Although I wasn’t good with IPTables I managed to block a decent amount of bad traffic.</p>
<p>Now I put a new RSC Server back up on a Windows Server 2003 5 months later, now someones on a DDoS Spree. Switching from Staminus, they were doing 3-4GBPS Attacks.</p>
<p>I then switched to a new host that can handle 10GBPS Attacks. I’m still on a Windows Server and I want to switch to a CentOS 6 server again because IPTables and it can eb configured better against attacks.</p>
<p>I’m now getting hit with 14GBPS Attacks, which is quite hectic. Are there any experienced Linux users who would know how to configure IPTables and have any suggestions?</p>
<p>The only ports I use are, Port 80, Port 43594(TCP). I also have 32 usable IP Addresses.</p>

I was looking especially at either Mint or Arch (both with XFCE, both of which I have already installed on my 10yo HP and netbook respectively). Both of these computers are also generally not my top choices for general computer use, hence my decision to install Linux on my MBP. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’ve been recommended several distros by various IRCers, including: Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, Fedora, and of course, Arch  :), most of which I have heard positive reviews as of installation and general usage on the Mac (not Fedora  :(). I’m fine with working in a terminal environment without a GUI so it doesn’t scare me too much, but generally I want a distro with abundant information on other users’ experiences with their distros on the MBPs.</p>
<p>The main thing I’m worried about is bootloaders. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> I approach most of them with abnormal trepidation and I’m afraid that if I do something wrong, my Mac will be unbootable. Something known to be <span class="bbcode-u">reliable</span> would be great. ;D</p>
<p>Another concern that I have is reinstallation. I’m having this computer until I graduate senior year (about a little over a year) and I don’t want to constantly reinstall every six months for new releases like Ubuntu and Mint (with the exception of LMDE which might also be a possibility if I hear more positive reviews of Debian on MBPs) do and not be outdated. Arch, a rolling release, seems great for this if it doesn’t break down (hue hue hue).</p>
<p>So as of now, Mint and Arch seem to be the best, with Arch having an excellent and superior wiki (for MBPs) and Mint having good driver support (in addition to being bloated, but who cares? love that LOL :D), so I’ll most likely choose one of them. However, the Arch wiki pages for MBP is pretty scattered and unspecific (or it was me reading them at a bad time) and I’m worried about corrupting my computer (I use it for school purposes, and P.S: I’m scared of partitioning incorrectly). And as most of you know about general hardware incompatibility of most distros on the MBP (let me rephrase that: “compatibility” with 999 configuration changes required), I don’t want to be spending too much time just setting it up to make it work (especially when it doesn’t work). I would favor something that I can set up without too much hassle (but if it’s in moderation it’s more than fine!).</p>
<p>Sorry for my exceptional usage of parenthetical remarks. Opinions (and especially personal experience) are more than appreciated.</p>

              <p>Well I just built by “NAS” server if you will (computer running Windows 7 with hard-drives woohoo). I have been doing alot of research on redundancy and backup options over the past couple of days RAID options, FlexRaid, SnapRaid, unRaid, Windows Storage Spaces, etc…and I have come to the conclusion that there is the possibility of getting fucked with all of those. I have decided on just having straight duplicate copies of files on duplicate hard drives.</p>
<p>I was wondering though if there is any program that will automatically check for files on Drive A, see if they are on Drive B, and if they are not then make a copy from drive A to drive B. And also I have a 240GB SSD I bought that I want to use as a “buffer” so I can copy over my network from my SSD quickly and get the process over with and then my server will take care of copying it from the “buffer” folder to drives A and B.</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 because I have server like applications that will only run on here and I am just all around familiar with it, and In my opinion its pretty damn good (maybe not for this purpose though).</p>
<p>My setup is:<br>
8GB DDR3 1333Mhz RAM<br>
AMD A4-5300 APU 3.4Ghz Dual Core<br>
1x 240GB SanDisk Extreme SATA III SSD<br>
2x 2TB WD NAS Hard Drives<br>
2x 3TB WD NAS Hard Drives</p>
<p>So that leaves 5TB of Space and 5TB of duplicate space. I will probably be buying another 2 3TB Harddrives next month.</p>
<p>Any ideas on the best way to accomplish what I asked above.</p>

              <p>My school is giving me (well, not giving me, but you get the point) $8,850 to build 6 brand new PCs from scratch, which equals out to precisely $1,475 per computer.  I must find the best quality parts and stay inside the budget.  Each part needs to be the best as possible so it performs well, lasts a long time, and very reliable.  I will be giving the school board a presentation which will have the following information about each part:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reliability rating &amp; source</li>
<li>Warranty</li>
<li>Product description</li>
<li>Product specification relevant to the decision process</li>
<li>Why I chose each part</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the part where I need you.  I need to find appropriate parts for these builds.  These machines will be going into the school’s Digital Media classroom, and will need to run many Adobe programs etc.  This is why the parts need to be reliable.  Anywho, this is the list of parts needed:</p>
<p>Power Supply</p>
<p>Monitor</p>
<p>Keyboard &amp; Mouse</p>
<p>Case</p>
<p>Motherboard</p>
<p>Graphics Card</p>
<p>RAM</p>
<p>CPU</p>
<p>Optical Drive (CD/DvD)</p>
<p>HDD or SSD (leaning towards a SSD, what are your opinions?  Note: mostly all the data is stored on the network.  Huge amounts of disk space is not needed, and is considered overkill.)</p>
<p>Operating system<br>
(Already made this choice.  Sticking with Windows 7 64 bit business)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t know what I need help on, it’s finding the right parts for these builds.  All I need is the best part for each part, while staying inside the budget.  Also, when showing me a part, please tell me the reason why you choose that part.  I’m not asking you to do this entire job for me, just give me some hints and tips for parts.  Any questions? Ask.</p>
<p>Also, if you want more info about the digital media classroom, They model, make websites, make videos, make images, etc.  The requirements they gave me are:</p>
<p>-able to run Microsoft office<br>
-3DS max<br>
-adobe illustrator<br>
-adobe premiere<br>
-adobe after effects<br>
-adobe photoshop<br>
-adobe fireworks<br>
-adobe dreamweaver</p>
<p>and must be able to</p>
<p>-import videos with a digital camera<br>
-and use scanners</p>
<p>All these things need to be done as fast as possible with no delay or crashing etc.</p>

              <p>Ok im a complete hardware retard, just wondering if anyone can help me find a few last pieces and just have a glance over to makesure i havent fucked up w/ some of the stuff.</p>
<p>So I could do with some help finding a PSU, Any cooling parts etc &amp; a cheap ATX case (around £40 or less i guess, don’t give a fuck about case that much)</p>
<p>Most of my peripherals are just cheap crap. I’m not a gamer so I didn’t go for some hightech gfx card, but I do want to house my 2 Dell U2711’s in 2560 x 1440 via displayport. Hence why I bought 2xGFX cards. Is this ok? Dual displayport cards were either ridic shit or ridic expensive.</p>
<p>So yeah, Case/PSU/Cooling/Maybe cables? Anything else.</p>
<p>Appreciate it thanks.</p>
