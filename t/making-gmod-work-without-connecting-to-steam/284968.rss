              <p>Try Steambuster.</p>
<p>Here you find it: <a href="http://www.freesteam.org/forums/clients-cracks-launchers/6097-steam-buster-revolution-orangebox-rc3.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.freesteam.org/forums/clients-cracks-launchers/6097-steam-buster-revolution-orangebox-rc3.html</a></p>
<p>If the Steambuster window don’t show up, go to sbrev.ini<br>
And change the Top and Left line values to anything non negative like I did here.<br>
Top=490<br>
Left=215</p>

              <p>If you download Gmod with cracksteam you can play it offline and on the non-steam servers, but not the ones on the server list. Setti has a couple of servers on their “other” games list.</p>
