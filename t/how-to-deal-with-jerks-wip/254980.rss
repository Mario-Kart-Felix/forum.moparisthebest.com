    <description>[size=28pt][b]This guide is not meant to make you want to go out and fight someone, this is about fighting someone as a last resort for a good cause.[/b][/size]



Alright, I haven&#39;t been on MITB for a while and thought I would share my guide with you.

[b]Kid at school giving you shit, ruined your life, messing with your girl?
[/b]

First, we are going to imagine that this kid giving you trouble is bigger than you. Not much bigger, might have 20 pounds and a few inches on you. Here are your options.

1. Demand an apology
2. Forget about it

There are faults with these 2 options, forgetting about it may make it worse, and the kid might just have enough balls to not give you a straightforward apology.

Now I represent to you, option 3.

[b][u]KICK HIS ASS[/u][/b]

[img]http://thesituationist.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/fight-club.jpg[/img]


Now, I only resort to option 3 if this kid only understands one thing : Pain.

Listen clearly, you should only fight someone if you are in such a blind fury you only care about these things:

1. I f*ckin hate this kid
2. This kid ruined my life
3. This kid doesn&#39;t listen

If you fight someone smartly, you should not get into much trouble. I will go through the safest option first.



[b]Option 1[/b]

Outside of school.

[u]Pros / Cons of fighting outside of school
[/u]

Pros:

*Chance of getting in no trouble at all
*You can do more damage without a teacher stopping you

Cons:
*Chance of getting in a sh*tload of trouble
*Might have to pay some medical bills



In School:

Pros:

*Everyone watches you kick this kids ass


Cons:
*Suspension/Detention/Expelled
*Everyone watches you possibly get your ass kicked
*Could end up in court





Now, onto the actual part of how to fight the kid.


[b]I want to make this clear, any movie you&#39;ve ever seen about fighting, disregard them. Anything you think you know about fighting, guess what. You don&#39;t. If you think you can fight, you can&#39;t. Trust me.[/b]

First off, here are some ground rules 

[b][size=20pt]PLANNING A FIGHT NEVER WORKS[/size][/b]

If you plan stuff like , &quot;Ooo i&#39;m gonna get a good face punch in and break his nose, maybe break some of his ribs.&quot; It will not work, ever. In the heat of battle, there is no time for planning. You must be swift.

[b][size=20pt]NOBODY EVER FIGHTS CLEAN[/size][/b]

No one ever fights a clean fight on the streets, so get over it. Fight like a pussy.




Now that you are fighting, there are many weaknesses a man has. 

The spots in red are referred to as &quot;Hot spots&quot; I will explain them. (PIcture isn&#39;t working, will update later.)
[img]http://img370.imageshack.us/my.php?image=hotspotsyz1.png[/img]

Get the person in a headlock if possible, and get as many shots as you can onto these spots:
Parts marked in blue = Very Effective
Temple: In a headlock you can land many weak shots to the temple. Not recommended. 
Jaw: Serious damage, could cause the person to bite their tongue
Nose: Not as much damage, hurts extremely bad, could cause nosebleed
Throat: This is a mean spot to hit, as a hard enough hit could cause fatality, and also hurts extremely bad.

Punches to the ribs can cause a man to keel over. If you are so lucky as this to happen, knee them in the lower face and the fight will be over.

[b][size=20pt]USE YOUR SURROUNDINGS![/size][/b]

From personal experience I have learned it its great to use your surroundings. I fought a kid on pavement once, and ended the fight shortly by smashing him into the pavement. Using your surroundings is smart and could win the fight for you if you are in a bad situation. I heard a story about a 5 ft kid taking out a 6&#39; 3 football player. He punched him in the face and the football player fell and smacked his head on the water fountain. 

School:

Lockers, desks, tile floor, water fountain

Outside of School:
Pavement, telephone poles, fences, mailboxes, etc.

[b][size=20pt]How to Know When a Fight is Over[/size][/b]

Simple. When a fight is over is in your hands. YOU choose whether he walks away crying, bleeding, or really got the message. Do not do more damage than needed.



Now that the fight is over, you should feel achieved and relived if it solved your problem. Now wipe the blood off your chin and walk home (or back to class)

First thing you’re taught in any form of fighting, mainly boxing, is to always protect your jaw. It’s the known as the “button”, and if that button is pushed, out you go. This is why people in boxing always have their head down, to protect it.[/quote]</p>
