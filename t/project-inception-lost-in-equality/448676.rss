 • About Project Inception: Project Inception is a challenge that is wanted by many players we plan to keep the XP to a good rate and keep the economy strict as most people do not wish to achieve 2 bill in one day. You start off with a pretty basic starter and venture out in the world of Project Inception you&#39;ll meet many friends but many foes. PKing is one of the many ways players can show dominance over each other and venture off with their belongings. We hope that you enjoy your adventure at Project Inception.

 • Economy: Players must rely on bosses and PKing to receive their wealth rather than just dicing and asking for money and even donating for it. Economy is strict so that when you PK someone you feel like it&#39;s an achievement rather than &quot;Oh, I got 2B doesn&#39;t matter.&quot; Bosses have a huge rarity of dropping items that are valuable some bosses have even ventured out into the wild so you must have a reliable team and hope you don&#39;t encounter lurers on your way there. Also to keep stability we ensure that voting points are strict and not receive 5M to ruin the eco quickly.


 • Staff: Our staff is hand chosen wisely as staff must go through player scenarios to see whether they got the means of becoming a good staff member or corrupt. We also  make sure we got a good biography about your staff knowing their personal information such as:
 • Age
 • RSPS Expericience
 • Maturity

We do not wish to pick 12 year immature staff.


 • Bosses: Bosses are common in most servers but we hand picked some good rare ones that will dazzle the experience, players have access to over 25 bosses (Excluding Donator bosses) Some bosses are throughout the wild to get a little creative and to engrave that fear of players barraging you for your inventory. We also put a 
Muddy chest in the wildy found in the lava maze of 50 wild but the chests guardian awaits you...  The notorious Inadequacy it has a rarity of dropping a Muddy key in which players can use on the Muddy chest for a random prize with the rarity of a valuable item.


 • Skilling: We tried to get a bit creative with the environment of skilling rather than having one whole skilling zone where players can skill in 1 area we spread it out around the Project Inception giving skilling a bit of originality.


• Player Killing: PKing is fun for many players so we decided to give it some of our own touches, Player Killing is now a way to make money as each kill earns you a certain amount of Coins, Ranks are given based on how many kills you have received.


• Monsters: We bring you many unique training zones in the vast lands of Project Inception and many new monsters to fight and train on rather than being limited to just the casual Rock Crabs we also created 2 dungeons for training, 1 for Donators and 1 for F2P. Fully animated and aggressive, players are quite bored of non-stop 0&#39;s hit on them by monsters so we decided to nerf the Protect Prayers just to get creative.

• Combat: Combat is very important to Project Inception. Did you know most of Project Inception was dedicated to it&#39;s Combat? We made sure that we had up to date speeds, timers, projectiles, effects and so forth. We also included uncommon/New weapons for players to work for and enjoy. 


• Hope You Enjoy Project Inception! :)

<p>• About Project Inception: Project Inception is a challenge that is wanted by many players we plan to keep the XP to a good rate and keep the economy strict as most people do not wish to achieve 2 bill in one day. You start off with a pretty basic starter and venture out in the world of Project Inception you’ll meet many friends but many foes. PKing is one of the many ways players can show dominance over each other and venture off with their belongings. We hope that you enjoy your adventure at Project Inception.</p>
<p>• Economy: Players must rely on bosses and PKing to receive their wealth rather than just dicing and asking for money and even donating for it. Economy is strict so that when you PK someone you feel like it’s an achievement rather than “Oh, I got 2B doesn’t matter.” Bosses have a huge rarity of dropping items that are valuable some bosses have even ventured out into the wild so you must have a reliable team and hope you don’t encounter lurers on your way there. Also to keep stability we ensure that voting points are strict and not receive 5M to ruin the eco quickly.</p>
<p>• Staff: Our staff is hand chosen wisely as staff must go through player scenarios to see whether they got the means of becoming a good staff member or corrupt. We also  make sure we got a good biography about your staff knowing their personal information such as:<br>
• Age<br>
• RSPS Expericience<br>
• Maturity</p>
<p>We do not wish to pick 12 year immature staff.</p>
<p>• Bosses: Bosses are common in most servers but we hand picked some good rare ones that will dazzle the experience, players have access to over 25 bosses (Excluding Donator bosses) Some bosses are throughout the wild to get a little creative and to engrave that fear of players barraging you for your inventory. We also put a<br>
Muddy chest in the wildy found in the lava maze of 50 wild but the chests guardian awaits you…  The notorious Inadequacy it has a rarity of dropping a Muddy key in which players can use on the Muddy chest for a random prize with the rarity of a valuable item.</p>
<p>• Skilling: We tried to get a bit creative with the environment of skilling rather than having one whole skilling zone where players can skill in 1 area we spread it out around the Project Inception giving skilling a bit of originality.</p>
<p>• Player Killing: PKing is fun for many players so we decided to give it some of our own touches, Player Killing is now a way to make money as each kill earns you a certain amount of Coins, Ranks are given based on how many kills you have received.</p>
<p>• Monsters: We bring you many unique training zones in the vast lands of Project Inception and many new monsters to fight and train on rather than being limited to just the casual Rock Crabs we also created 2 dungeons for training, 1 for Donators and 1 for F2P. Fully animated and aggressive, players are quite bored of non-stop 0’s hit on them by monsters so we decided to nerf the Protect Prayers just to get creative.</p>
<p>• Combat: Combat is very important to Project Inception. Did you know most of Project Inception was dedicated to it’s Combat? We made sure that we had up to date speeds, timers, projectiles, effects and so forth. We also included uncommon/New weapons for players to work for and enjoy.</p>
<p>• Hope You Enjoy Project Inception! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
