    <title>Roger Waters gave some pro trolling advice in 1977</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need.
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you&#39;re on the street,
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed.
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight,
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.

And after a while, you can work on points for style.
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake,
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile.
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,
So that when they turn their backs on you,
You&#39;ll get the chance to put the knife in.

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder.
You know it&#39;s going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you
get older.
And in the end you&#39;ll pack up and fly down south,
Hide your head in the sand,
Just another sad old man,
All alone and dying of cancer.

And when you loose control, you&#39;ll reap the harvest you have sown.
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone.
And it&#39;s too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw
around.
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone,
Dragged down by the stone.

I gotta admit that I&#39;m a little bit confused.
Sometimes it seems to me as if I&#39;m just being used.
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise.
If I don&#39;t stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this
maze?

Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone&#39;s expendable and no-one has a real friend.
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everything&#39;s done under the sun,
And you believe at heart, everyone&#39;s a killer.

Who was born in a house full of pain.
Who was trained not to spit in the fan.
Who was told what to do by the man.
Who was broken by trained personnel.
Who was fitted with collar and chain.
Who was given a pat on the back.
Who was breaking away from the pack.
Who was only a stranger at home.
Who was ground down in the end.
Who was found dead on the phone.
Who was dragged down by the stone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

</aside>
<p>Davidscape, from someone whose username is <span class="bbcode-b">David</span>i2, sure you weren’t thinking of your first name. Why shouldn’t I make assumptions when the majority of the time I’m correct?</p>
<blockquote>2. I meant over time I wouldn't be the only one who would rep--. Dont be retarded.</blockquote>
You're the one who said it, am I being retarded for interpreting someone who has shown their self to be stupid to be terrible at maths, or maybe that person just has poor observation skills and didn't notice the guy he was arguing with had over 140 rep? I don't think so, and since you're said stupid person it's hardly in your ball field to call me retarded.
<blockquote>3. [quote]We hate moparscapers for a reason;one which you're reinforcing beautifully.[/quote]     Read the rules (#2) then, mind explaining how I was "reinforcing" it while others were just as retarded? You guys just hate us because we are "Moparscapers" even though you know nothing about most of us. You judge the first retards from MPSC and then assume everyone is.</blockquote>
Rule 2 is there because Moparisthebest, like most rednecks, is probably religious. Either that or it's just there as an ideal. Which it is, but I'm intelligent enough to know that everyone isn't equal and when the time is right I will make sure to ignore it.
<p>I can read your posts and get a good enough impression of you, I don’t give a shit if I know nothing about you, that argument is flawed. You meet someone in the street for the first time and you make a first judgmental impression - it’s instinct and we both do it. I know plenty of decent people who came out of MoparScape stop thinking you’re automatically labeled once you came over here, if you didn’t have such a stupid fucking signature I wouldn’t even know.</p>
<blockquote>If you guys knew how you sound and read everything you said about MPSC, you might possibly realize that your horse is so tall that your head is in the clouds and you can't see anything in front of your face.</blockquote>
When you're on top of the world with nothing but the warm sun and clear skies why look down?
<blockquote>If you think you can "comeback" from this don't bother, I won't be looking at this topic again. You can PM me, and then you can go home, back into my 'trash'.</blockquote>
I don't think I can come back, I know I can. I'll bother because it's my choice and whether you like it or not overwhelming curiosity will come over you when you see I've replied. I know this because you know this, as you read it right now. WOW! I predicted the future! pretty impressive right? Right about now you're probably going to close your browser window to hide that you looked, but we all know you did ;)
<p>I’m not sure what kind of insult that final line was but whatever the desired effect it quite honestly failed to fly. All in all I think you just annihilated yourself, but by all means come back for more… it’s been a while. Next time just lay off using single and double quotation marks on unnecessary words, too much poor grammar hurts my eyes.</p>

              <blockquote>You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need.
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street,
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed.
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight,
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.
<p>And after a while, you can work on points for style.<br>
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake,<br>
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile.<br>
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,<br>
So that when they turn their backs on you,<br>
You’ll get the chance to put the knife in.</p>
<p>You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder.<br>
You know it’s going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you<br>
get older.<br>
And in the end you’ll pack up and fly down south,<br>
Hide your head in the sand,<br>
Just another sad old man,<br>
All alone and dying of cancer.</p>
<p>And when you loose control, you’ll reap the harvest you have sown.<br>
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone.<br>
And it’s too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw<br>
around.<br>
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone,<br>
Dragged down by the stone.</p>
<p>I gotta admit that I’m a little bit confused.<br>
Sometimes it seems to me as if I’m just being used.<br>
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise.<br>
If I don’t stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this<br>
maze?</p>
<p>Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending<br>
That everyone’s expendable and no-one has a real friend.<br>
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner<br>
And everything’s done under the sun,<br>
And you believe at heart, everyone’s a killer.</p>
<p>Who was born in a house full of pain.<br>
Who was trained not to spit in the fan.<br>
Who was told what to do by the man.<br>
Who was broken by trained personnel.<br>
Who was fitted with collar and chain.<br>
Who was given a pat on the back.<br>
Who was breaking away from the pack.<br>
Who was only a stranger at home.<br>
Who was ground down in the end.<br>
Who was found dead on the phone.<br>
Who was dragged down by the stone.</p>
