</aside>
<p>Davidscape, from someone whose username is <span class="bbcode-b">David</span>i2, sure you weren’t thinking of your first name. Why shouldn’t I make assumptions when the majority of the time I’m correct?</p>
<blockquote>2. I meant over time I wouldn't be the only one who would rep--. Dont be retarded.</blockquote>
You're the one who said it, am I being retarded for interpreting someone who has shown their self to be stupid to be terrible at maths, or maybe that person just has poor observation skills and didn't notice the guy he was arguing with had over 140 rep? I don't think so, and since you're said stupid person it's hardly in your ball field to call me retarded.
<blockquote>3. [quote]We hate moparscapers for a reason;one which you're reinforcing beautifully.[/quote]     Read the rules (#2) then, mind explaining how I was "reinforcing" it while others were just as retarded?

Rule 2 is there because Moparisthebest, like most rednecks, is probably religious. Either that or it's just there as an ideal. Which it is, but I'm intelligent enough to know that everyone isn't equal and when the time is right I will make sure to ignore it.
<p>I can read your posts and get a good enough impression of you, I don’t give a shit if I know nothing about you, that argument is flawed. You meet someone in the street for the first time and you make a first judgmental impression - it’s instinct and we both do it. I know plenty of decent people who came out of MoparScape stop thinking you’re automatically labeled once you came over here, if you didn’t have such a stupid fucking signature I wouldn’t even know.</p>
<blockquote>If you guys knew how you sound and read everything you said about MPSC, you might possibly realize that your horse is so tall that your head is in the clouds and you can't see anything in front of your face.</blockquote>
When you're on top of the world with nothing but the warm sun and clear skies why look down?
<blockquote>If you think you can "comeback" from this don't bother, I won't be looking at this topic again. You can PM me, and then you can go home, back into my 'trash'.</blockquote>
I don't think I can come back, I know I can. I'll bother because it's my choice and whether you like it or not overwhelming curiosity will come over you when you see I've replied. I know this because you know this, as you read it right now. WOW! I predicted the future! pretty impressive right? Right about now you're probably going to close your browser window to hide that you looked, but we all know you did ;)
<p>I’m not sure what kind of insult that final line was but whatever the desired effect it quite honestly failed to fly. All in all I think you just annihilated yourself, but by all means come back for more… it’s been a while. Next time just lay off using single and double quotation marks on unnecessary words, too much poor grammar hurts my eyes.</p>
