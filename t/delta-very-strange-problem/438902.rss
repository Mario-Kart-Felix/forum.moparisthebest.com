    <title>[Delta] Very strange problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-very-strange-problem/438902</link>
    <description>So this has never been a problem for me before, maybe I just forgot how to do it since I haven&#39;t done it in along time.

Okay the problem is I am adding models in..I put the .dat file in my models folder, I go to class.8 and add my ints.

Switch over to my source put the item id in the item.cfg...go to item.java and put the appropriate equipping.

Well when I do my pickup command and get the item..it shows up invisible and its invisible as I equip it..it shows the name when I right click it and etc..it is not the model because I have tried other ones to...

What have I done wrong?</description>

              <p>The model is one up for download and my source is a blank source so it does not have that command =/…if you have it that would be helpful.</p>

              <p>Is it a model you made? Or just one that was up for download? Also, have you made any changes to it or opened it in datmaker?<br>
Edit: When you’re ingame, try typing <span class="bbcode-b">addmodel ####</span> the ‘####’ being the model that’s used for your weapon/armor.</p>
