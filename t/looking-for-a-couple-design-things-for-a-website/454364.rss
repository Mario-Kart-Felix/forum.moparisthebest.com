    <title>Looking for a couple design things for a website</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-couple-design-things-for-a-website/454364</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, I am looking to get some help with a website I am developing. I am making it for my brother and his friend for their car audio business they are starting.

A website they really liked was: http://www.dd4life.com

So far I pretty much only have a top home image made and the nav bar. Then I was thinking of making a table below and making the background of that white and the background of the whole entire page black. (Not sure if that would work but they requested a blue and white color scheme)

Here comes the stuff I need:
1. I need something where the images like scroll. Kind of like the thing on craigslist where people can select an image or it scrolls through them automatically. I have no idea how to make it though. One like http://www.dd4life.com would work too. 

2. A shopping cart. Although their business is small right now, they are hoping to eventually do more sales online. A shopping cart would be great. I&#39;m hoping it would be an easy way to organize the page too.

I&#39;m not sure what else right now. I just need to think of a way to categorize like how they did it like this:
[IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/v8mn4g.png[/img]

Everything is centered well under the top image and they have it looking good. The outside is black and center white. Tips on all this would be great!</description>

<p>I do have an issue with that statement, and in order to help the OP I won’t take it to PM. Pure Javascript is basically the same as using jQuery, no it doesn’t have to be found in only script files, and putting it in the header isn’t really an issue unless it is enough to slow down the page loading. In this instance, it can go above the ending body tag to ensure this isn’t an issue.<br>

I already noted it doesn’t have to be added only via head. It just looks nicer that way. And you may not want to add it into the html page, because say it creates a slow loading time, or maybe, like me, he likes it to be separated. As long as it’s added it won’t do harm.</p>

<p>Adding it to where I said it should go is actually the opposite of it creating a slow loading time compared to putting it in the header simply due to the fact the rendering and the request for these files run on the same thread, so rendering gets interrupted when there is Javascript that needs to be loaded. Hence, it is placed at the bottom of the document. It could be seperated this way aswell.</p>
<p>Yes it is the same, I understand and already said that.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: You can definitely choose jQuery (and it is a good idea since jQuery is a very nice library), but I’m saying you don’t need to add in the extra request for an entire library in order to import something like a slideshow. Ultimately it is your choice, but if you use jQuery already, might as well use a plugin right?</p>

<p>As for that shopping cart. What are you trying to get at exactly. We need to know what source of payment they will take etc. The easiest way to go would make a 3 column table. being like this:<br>
Item Image|| Description || Price.</p>
<p>Then at the bottom there could be a pay button.</p>

The white on top of black is a good way to go, as white is a distracting color away from the black.[/quote]</p>
<p>Is a flash slideshow how most people do it? If so feel free to pm me it.</p>

              <p>Hello everyone, I am looking to get some help with a website I am developing. I am making it for my brother and his friend for their car audio business they are starting.</p>
<p>A website they really liked was: <a href="http://www.dd4life.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dd4life.com</a></p>
<p>So far I pretty much only have a top home image made and the nav bar. Then I was thinking of making a table below and making the background of that white and the background of the whole entire page black. (Not sure if that would work but they requested a blue and white color scheme)</p>
<p>Here comes the stuff I need:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I need something where the images like scroll. Kind of like the thing on craigslist where people can select an image or it scrolls through them automatically. I have no idea how to make it though. One like <a href="http://www.dd4life.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dd4life.com</a> would work too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A shopping cart. Although their business is small right now, they are hoping to eventually do more sales online. A shopping cart would be great. I’m hoping it would be an easy way to organize the page too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not sure what else right now. I just need to think of a way to categorize like how they did it like this:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i48.tinypic.com/v8mn4g.png" title="v8mn4g.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i48.tinypic.com/v8mn4g.png" alt width="690" height="348"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">v8mn4g.png</span><span class="informations">1090×550</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Everything is centered well under the top image and they have it looking good. The outside is black and center white. Tips on all this would be great!</p>
