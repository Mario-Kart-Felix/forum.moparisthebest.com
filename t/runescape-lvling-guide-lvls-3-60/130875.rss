    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-lvling-guide-lvls-3-60/130875</link>
    <description>Combat lvl 3-15

Step 1:

Go to the attack dummies located across the East Varrock Bank.

Select the attack option from the combat menu

Keep attacking the dummies until you are around lvl 8. After this you should be around combat lvl 5 or 6. After you have attacked the dummies to this level, you cannot attack them anymore to gain experience.

Step 2:

When you have reached attack lvl 8, you should head to the goblin house Northeast of Lumbridge. 

Here you will work on raising your combat lvl to 15 by fighting the lvl 2 goblins. You should work on your strength levels next. 

Select the strength option from the combat menu:

You should raise your strength to at least 22. This normally takes a little over an hour, depending on how many people are in the house. Be sure to keep the door closed on the goblin house so they will not leave the building.

After obtaining 22 str, select the defense option from the combat menu:

You will need to raise your defense to lvl 5. After you have reached lvl 5 defense, switch back to the attack lvl, and raise it to at least 10.

Congratulations! You have just reached combat lvl 15/16.



Combat lvl 15-25

Step 1:

First off you need to head to the goblin village Northwest of Falodor.

*Note: You will need to bring some food, and also equip the proper armor and weapon (which is steel at this point, black for weapon) if you can afford it.

You should start by raising your defense to lvl at least 20.
Then also raise you attack to lvl 20, as well.

If at anytime you get low on food, be sure to take some time out and visit the bank in Falodor to buy or take food out of your bank account.

When you have reached the desired goals for defense and attack, concentrate on raising your strentgh to lvl 25.
This should roughly take around 2 hours to complete.

Option 2:

If at anytime you feel that the lvl 5 goblins are getting hard, or taking too much food, you can always stay at the goblin house Northeast of Lumbridge to achieve your leveling goals.

Congratulations! You have just reached combat lvl 25.



Combat lvl 25-30

Now that you are getting a stronger character you now have a couple of options for the next step.

*Note: I would advise that you upgrade your armor...if you have the money to do so. At this level you should purchase full Mith armor. I would suggest a Mith scimitar as your weapon.

If you do not have the money, please refer to The Ultimate Runescape Millions Guide, if you have it. If you do not have the Millions Guide, click on features (to the left) to view what the guide has to offer. 

Option 1: Dwarven Mines

Head to the Dwarven Mines:

Do not enter the mines. The best spot to raise your levels are outside the entrance of the mine:

Here you will face lvl 10 dwarves. Be sure that you have plently of food before you begin to battle them. 

Work on your strength first. You need to raise your strength lvl to at least 35. 

Continue fighting the dwarves, and raise your attack and defense to lvl 30.

Option 2: Al Kharid

Head to the Al Kharid palace:

Here you will fight lvl 9 Al Kharid warriors. 

*Note: When you attack one warrior, all other warriors in the area will attack you as well! BE SURE YOU HAVE FOOD! This can be a quicker way to gain exp., but just be careful. Don&#39;t hesitate to run if you are low in health.

You should concentrate on raising your strength to lvl 35, then raise your attack and defense to 30.

After completing these goals you should be around combat lvl 30.

Congratulations! You have just reached combat lvl 30.



Combat lvl 35-45

Now that you are getting a stronger character you now have a couple of options for the next step.

*Note: I would advise that you upgrade your armor...if you have the money to do so. At this level you should purchase full Addy armor. I would suggest an Addy scimitar or Battle Axe as your weapon.

If you do not have the money, please refer to The Ultimate Runescape Millions Guide , if you have it. If you do not have the Millions Guide, click on features (to the left) to view what the guide has to offer. 

Option 1: Dwarven Mines/Al Kharid Mine

At these 2 locations you should focus on fighting the lvl 14 scorpions. Although the drop absolutly nothing, they are a very easy kill for the experience gained.

At this point you should choose what ability your character should favor. To build an all around character, I would suggest raising your strength 5 lvls, then raise your attack 5 lvls, then work on defense for 5 lvls. Then continue the process. If you have a combat calculator you can very easily determine when you will level up.

Option 2: Varrock Sewers

Here you should focus on attacking the lvl 18 Skeletons just past the zombies.

Option 3: Ice Caves- mid 30&#39;s to 45

At this lvl you should focus on the lvl 28 Hobgoblins. 

Continue this strategy until you have reached at least lvl 45.

Congratulations! You have just reached combat lvl 40-45.



Combat lvl 45-60

At this point, you should pretty much have the hang of combat training, listed below you will find some locations of good monsters to train on.

Cave South of Rimmington/Ice Caves .

Continue training here until you are at least lvl 53:

DO THE DRAGON SLAYER QUEST!

It may seem scary to fight the dragon at first. I would suggest finding a quest guide for this quest if you are fairly new to Runescape. The first time I faught him I was lvl 51, it took all that I had to beat him but I did!

After you have beaten this quest you can now wear Full Rune. I would also suggest buying a Rune Scimmy or Rune Battle Axe as well.



Karjama Island: lvl 50-60

At these levels you should focus on the lvl 34 Deadly Red Spiders. However, for a good challenge, bring lots of food and fight the lvl 82 Lesser Demons. They take alot longer to kill, but the experience is great.

Well that is the end of the guide for now. After you have reached lvl 60 you should really consider becoming a member, if you are not so already. 

Congratulations! You have just reached combat lvl 60.</description>
