        <p>Fucking hell. Yakman’s post made me cringe.<br>
There is no pie. You don’t have to be poor for someone else to be rich. There’s this ridiculous notion that there’s a limited amount of wealth in the world, and it’s absurd.</p>
<p>Why are some people earning 27 million yearly? Because either they or their forerunners were go-getters and had a bit of luck on their side. Really though, they understand something that some of you guys clearly don’t: Money and wealth are not one in the same; money is a tool to move wealth around, and nothing more.</p>
<p>What happens when you create a work of art that is admired by the masses? You’re one work of art wealthier. You can sell it to someone, for money, so this isn’t even a metaphorical example or anything like that.<br>
Is that person poorer? No, they aren’t - they’re now one work of art richer themselves. They value your art, so they were prepared to move that wealth into their own collection utilising money to perform the transaction.</p>
<p>Opportunity cost will come in around here for some of you - ‘but now that they’ve purchased the art work, they can’t purchase Object A OR Object B OR Object C’.<br>
So what? They valued your work of art for what it was – something that would increase their happiness, improve their livelihood, whatever.<br>
Anyway, you now have more money which allows you to acquire wealth, and they’re no poorer.</p>
<p>Another example: J.K. Rowling writes Harry Potter and goes from rags to riches in less than a decade. And not just a small amount of money, but billions.<br>
Is everyone who bought her book poorer for it? No.<br>
If they didn’t believe that they would be better for reading her books then they wouldn’t have bought them.<br>
As someone who bought and read her entire series, I believe anyone who read that story was wealthier for it. You may not, and so you may have chosen not to trade your money for that wealth.</p>
<p>It’s ironic that some of the people here are oblivious to this, considering the computer programmer is the craftsman of our time.</p>
<p>Paul Graham wrote an article on this which radically changed my views on the matter. It was a real eye-opener, and I’ve linked to it previously. Of course, his example was restoring a car to mint condition - do that and the world, but ultimately you, is one mint condition car richer.<br>
He aptly pointed out that those furthest removed from the creation of wealth (students like you and I yakman, journalists who create trashy tabloid articles, blue collar workers, etc) are quick to scream ‘injustice!!1’ and the like.<br>
They’re also the most oblivious to the truth: Nobody is stopping them from contributing something to society, such as literature/art/music/software/etc.</p>
<p>The real injustice is when someone creates something revolutionary (perhaps tomorrow’s cure for cancer) which makes EVERYONE wealthier.<br>
Should they not control the billions of dollars that such a piece of wealth would bring them?</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:48, topic:387096”][quote author=Frell link=topic=482889.msg3548342#msg3548342 date=1301338601]<br>
Actually Yakman you have a good point on wealth redistribution. I think I might start pushing grade redistribution also. Take a few % points from the A and B students and give them to the C and D and F students so everyone can graduate highschool.</p>
<p>Whose with me?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Pope Benedict called, he wants his false analogies back.[/quote]<br>
Is that a joke or what? It’s actually a really good analogy, and the only time it doesn’t apply is when someone is rich solely because they won the lottery.</p>
<p>And even if they did win the lottery, why hate them for it? Everyone else who bought a ticket had precisely the same chance of winning per dollar invested… Except for the Doctor, who took a trip back in his TARDIS after identifying the time and location that the winning ticket was sold at, bought it, and then gave it to Donna Noble as a wedding gift.</p>
<p>Straight A students are winners because they work hard, not because they luck out.<br>
Straight F students are losers because they don’t do shit, not because they’re unlucky.</p>

</aside>
<p>Firstly, it depends on what you mean. Poor and rich can be measured relatively which would certainly mean that a rich person requires a poor person to exist.</p>
<p>Now, there’s two ways of someone becoming wealthier.</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating the wealth.</li>
<li>Getting it from someone else.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that my post showed that the wealth gained by the top 1% is almost exactly equal to the wealth lost by the bottom 80% which strongly suggests 2) happened. The burden of proof is on you to show that actually 1) happened, which you insinuate by saying “there no pie”, and you also have to explain where all the wealth from the bottom 80% went and why the numbers just happen (by coincidence presumably?) to be so similar.</p>
<p>Moving on.</p>

<p>Read the footnote.<br>
It says they’ve taken economic growth into account. It means that economic growth disproportionately went to the top 1%.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is exactly the point one of my posts was trying to make.</p>
<p>If things really worked like you just said, you’d expect to see people from every kind of background in every income band. So we’d see many children of millionaires who turn out lazy and end up working minimum wage. We’d see many children of minimum wage parents who turn out really bright and hard-working and become millionaires.<br>
That obviously doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>This is what this graph meant.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/gen/69348/original.jpg" alt width="550" height="346"></p>
<p>Social mobility is a measure of the ability of people to change their income band. We see that the European social democratic model, which redistributes some wealth and spends it on good schools, universities and hospitals, have large amounts of social mobility. In these countries, who your parents are matters little, much less than in countries with the other model. We see in the UK and US how you can predict to a very good accuracy, how much someone will earn just by looking at how much their parents earn. Its been called neo-feudalism when social positions are inherited like this.</p>
<p>The reason I think social democracy is a good system is because, like you, I think the hardest, smartest, best people should be allowed to rise to the top. Its clear to me that when those people are on the top then the entire society does better. I’m sure you agree with this as well. Problem is, that doesn’t happen on its own. We see people who, by the accident of their birth, end up on top.<br>
It is the role of society to give everybody an equal opportunity in life. That means building good schools and universities where people can get educated regardless of their background.<br>
You right wing types don’t want that because that would require taxation. It seems to me you only want the children of the rich to become educated because only they could afford good schools.</p>
<p>Then there’s also the moral issues of allowing somebody to starve to death just because the economy happens to be in recession and they couldn’t find a job, or because they were unlucky enough to become ill. Half of all bankruptcies in the US were caused by illness and medical bills. So what if you’re a really great, hard-working, smart guy who just accidentally got cancer? Isn’t it much better for a social democracy to give free healthcare to everybody which allows really smart, hard-working but unlucky people to rise to the top?</p>

<p>I agree with you, this fact is irrelevant.</p>

</aside>
<p>Is that a joke or what? It’s actually a really good analogy, and the only time it doesn’t apply is when someone is rich solely because they won the lottery.</p>
<p>And even if they did win the lottery, why hate them for it? Everyone else who bought a ticket had precisely the same chance of winning per dollar invested… Except for the Doctor, who took a trip back in his TARDIS after identifying the time and location that the winning ticket was sold at, bought it, and then gave it to Donna Noble as a wedding gift.</p>
<p>Straight A students are winners because they work hard, not because they luck out.<br>
Straight F students are losers because they don’t do shit, not because they’re unlucky.[/quote]</p>
<p>One reason its a bad analogy is that grades (at least in the UK) at set on a totally relative level. Its impossible for everybody in the country to get an A (say) because exam boards have a policy where every year, 10% of people get an A, 10% get a B, ect ect<br>
In fact its possible to get an A by doing really badly <span class="bbcode-i">provided everybody else in the entire country does worse</span>.<br>
Wealth doesn’t work like that because, as you said, there is no pie. (also wealth in many cases doesn’t come from meritocratic means, but I’ve already covered that)</p>

<p>I’ve just given you an example centered around the author of the Harry Potter series. She was homeless until she wrote those books.<br>
You’re a cynic if you think everyone who bought her book, because they wanted to, was poorer despite the fact that they got something out of the transaction. She neither robbed them of their own wealth nor coerced them into the transaction.</p>

<p>“There is no pie” should be how the world is run, howwever that is not the case. Money has actually replaced wealth now. You could write the best book ever, and if it was not bought by anyone, would you truly be any richer? The world does not go by trade anymore, so you wouldn’t be able to trade it for something else. Money was meant to support wealth, not replace it, but things got out of hand so much wealth can change in an instant.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Your ‘best book ever’ may be very subjectively described. After all, if it truly was the best book ever then publishers would be all over you like women are all over Jason Statham.</p>
<p>In no way is money wealth.<br>
Do you sleep on a bed of $100 notes? Do you eat money, or drink money? Do you wear it when you go out with your friends? Do you live in a house made of $100 notes?<br>
The answer is clearly no. You use the money to acquire a bed, food, and beverages. You use it to buy the clothes you’re wearing, and you use it to buy the time and resources required to build a house.<br>
In short, the wealth you have is a comfortable bed, food and drink, clothing, a home. And, if you continue to either work or acquire more money through wealth creation, then you can continue to trade that money for wealth.</p>
<p>Time for your post Yakman:<br>
First and foremost, the only ranking (and that’s what you have described - not a grade) given in high school here is the old UAI score, which is now referred to as an ATAR score I think.<br>
Indeed, the example doesn’t apply to this. This ranking is used for university entry, as there are a limited number of university places.</p>
<p>Everything else that I’ve sat, however, has clearly marked grading brackets in terms of percentage correct – in which case Frell’s analogy not only stands, but shines.<br>
Case in point: it is entirely possible for everyone in my university courses to get High Distinctions (the highest grade). They merely have to kick arse in the exam and assignments.<br>
It is also entirely possible for everyone to fail a course, and some courses have an extremely high attrition rate. They don’t just say “Oh, you did really poorly but because you were in the top 10% of poor results, we’re going to pass you”.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am thoroughly overestimating the education systems in Britain and America, so if I am then you’ll have to forgive me.<br>
Here in Australia we had testing organised by individual states (titled ‘Basic Skills Tests’), and these were used in years 3, 5, 7, and 9. They ensure that a standard is met and maintained by all students.<br>
Those who do poorly have their parents and teachers notified so that their game can be lifted.<br>
For what it’s worth, there is now a nationally organised test, and a website that allows all parents to view the details of a school (specifically its ability to educate, based on the ability of its students to pass exams).</p>
<p>We also have a rigid curriculum which applies to all public and private schools, and is controlled by a central board and bureaucratic process.<br>
Suffice it to say that, here in Australia, everyone has a chance to shine.<br>
If they skip school, that’s their doing – and their parents can even be fined because of it.<br>
If they act silly in class, their doing.<br>
If they don’t do their homework and don’t have a legitimate reason (ie, abusive family), their doing.<br>
In my opinion, the poorer students have as much chance as richer students to make something of themselves.</p>
<p>My only beef with Australian high school is that there isn’t nearly enough critical thinking and analysis of things until the later years (10, 11, 12).<br>
I graduated from a catholic school, and it was fun advocating for things like abortion and euthanasia in religious studies (no, the teacher wasn’t a Texan or anything like that, so the class wasn’t backwards in its thinking).</p>
<blockquote>Firstly, it depends on what you mean. Poor and rich can be measured relatively which would certainly mean that a rich person requires a poor person to exist.
<p>Now, there’s two ways of someone becoming wealthier.</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating the wealth.</li>
<li>Getting it from someone else.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that my post showed that the wealth gained by the top 1% is almost exactly equal to the wealth lost by the bottom 80% which strongly suggests 2) happened. The burden of proof is on you to show that actually 1) happened, which you insinuate by saying “there no pie”, and you also have to explain where all the wealth from the bottom 80% went and why the numbers just happen (by coincidence presumably?) to be so similar.</p>
</blockquote><br>
This paragraph is based on a fallacy. Specifically, you assume that someone is poorer for having spent their money.<br>
Let’s say 1000 people each have $50. Everyone is equal, none of them work (for the sake of making this example easier to write), except for the ‘rich’ character I’m about to describe.<br>
J K Rowling, one of the 1000 people, writes Harry Potter book 1 and sells it for $10 a copy.<br>
Society, the other 999 people, hear about the story’s plot and absolutely must read it right now! They go to the book store and pay their $10, they go home and they’re entertained for however many hours… unless they’re a particularly fast reader, in which case maybe only one hour.<br>
Now we have perceived inequality. J K Rowling has $10,040, everyone else only has $40. She is 251 times ‘richer’ than everyone else in terms of money alone.
<p>She acquired that wealth by getting it from someone else - people had to sacrifice some of their money to acquire her book, after all. She didn’t just magic $9990 into her bank account.<br>
But if they got her book in return for the money, which was neither stolen nor coerced out of them, then they have decided that they value the book more. If they didn’t then they wouldn’t have bought the book in the first place.</p>
<p>Also note that the now poor members of that small society have lost precisely $9990, and the now rich member of society has gained precisely $9990.</p>
<p>Now another author, who was inspired after reading Rowling’s book, comes along and writes his own. It too is absolutely brilliant, and everyone must read it right away.<br>
So, this author included, there are 9999 people with $40 and one person (Rowling) with $10,040. So 998 ‘poor’ people pay $10 for this new book, and Rowling pays $10.<br>
The poor people, now numbering 998, each have $30 left.<br>
The rich people, Rowling and this new author, now have $10,030 each.<br>
So the poor have now lost precisely $19,960.<br>
The rich, Rowling and this author, have each acquired $9990 each, or a total of $19,980. The $20 difference is due to each of them buying the other’s book.</p>
<p>Is this proof of anything? No. I think it’s a good example though that highlights why the loss of money from the poor is so close to the increase of money in the rich.<br>
It also demonstrates an interesting outcome: Even if everybody’s money was reset to n dollars tomorrow and all existing wealth (intellectual property, buildings, etc) was relinquished, a small percentage of people would become rich all over again.</p>
<p>The question at the end of the day is are you going to be jealous of them (a very self-limiting trait), or are you going to kick arse and join them?</p>
<p>With regards to the image on economic growth, why shouldn’t the top 1% control the most?<br>
The top 1% of actors probably make 99% of the films worth watching, and the top 1% of musicians probably make 99% of the music that people <span class="bbcode-b">want to hear</span>.<br>
This is key. It’s not always about what’s ‘good’ by your subjective standards.</p>
<p>Example: I imagine Speljohan, being a metalhead, doesn’t like Lady Gaga. But if everyone else does then who gives a fuck about Speljohan’s opinion?<br>
Merit is subjective and giving the people what they want matters nine times out of ten, even if what they want is something like pop music.</p>
<p>I think I’ve answered everything that needs answering.<br>
A lot of this discussion, in my eyes, is penis envy and tall poppy syndrome.</p>
<p>Oh, and for what it’s worth, I’m not right-wing. I’m extremely liberal, but that doesn’t blind me to the fact that those who have made it in life shouldn’t be dragged down by the masses who haven’t.</p>

        <p>Lothy you’re being silly. JK Rowling is known to be a dick, right up there with bill gates. Once she realized how much the first book made, she became greedy like all humans do and proceeded to write numerous sequels to fulfill her love for money, taking every ounce of it from people who just want to know the ending. But she will never end the story, because she is greedy.</p>

        <p>What I meant was, wealth is only measured by those around you, not yourself. Money might be a tool to move  wealth, but without money you would have no wealth, simply because without money you cannot function in this world. What good would a nice book do you when you can’t pay your rent? I don’t think landlord would take a book instead, even if that book  was valued at a thousand dollars. Wealth can also be measured by your status in a given community. If someone who was well known for being smart was trying to sell a new idea, he would have a much easier time than someone who was not known for that particular quality, even though he might be 10 times smarter than person A. Taking your example of JK Rowling, if the poor people try to resell the book, do you think anyone would buy it from them? The buyer would probably ask for a smaller price than the book was originally valued at, which basically means the book is now valued less. Wealth is not set into stone, it changes around, and something that might have originally had a value of 1000 dollars might drop down to 800 tomorrow or might rise to 1200 the day after. The book JK Rowling is selling will not remain at 10 dollars forever, which was what I meant when I said money has replaced wealth.</p>
<blockquote>Your 'best book ever' may be very subjectively described. After all, if it truly was the best book ever then publishers would be all over you like women are all over Jason Statham.</blockquote>
<p>That is true, however people might not be able to appreciate how good the book is at that time. Think of all the scientists who came up with wild theories and got rejected by people, only to have these very theories proven years later, probably after the scientists death. What wealth has that scientist actually gained? Nothing, because the people around him did not value that discovery appropriately.</p>

<p>I’m not in the mood for adding any more long posts to this thread so I’ll try and keep it short.</p>
<p>I’m not quite sure you appreciate who the richest people are. If you think Bill Gates is rich and deserves it, then you’re probably right. Smart guy, philanthropist and incredibly charitable. He’s rich, Forbes says $56Bn, the second richest man?</p>
<p>No. Bill gates has FUCK ALL compared to certain people who have had rich ancestors exploiting money for generations and passing it down through inheritance. These people buy up things like Gold, and have it stored in private “banks” guarded by heavily armed security forces. You’re unlikely to find any evidence of their wealth, no taxes means they don’t declare it anywhere and it just keeps on piling up over generations. Best examples are heads of state who have never had to pay inheritance tax. These aren’t nice people, they aren’t necessarily smart the just inherit and continue to exploit the rest of the world for “wealth”. EG  Muburak; 30 years of dictatorship; his family’s estimated wealth = US says $2-3B many other sources say up to $70Bn. (I know which I believe is closer to the truth- Bill’s not so rich now is he?). This all came out of course because he had to try and move it when he got pawned by revolution.</p>
<p>Just makes me sad, “wealth” or “money” these silly little things that doesn’t actually exist (like religious views). Harry Potter could have been written for free Lothy, because the author might have enjoyed making people happy… that’s how stories used to be told anyway. Obviously it needs to be printed but if it cost as much as the paper/ink used it would be significantly cheaper, JK would make a living and so would the tree farmers. I think I just despise greed.</p>
<blockquote>simply because without money you cannot function in this world</blockquote>
Of course you can.
<p>This whole debate seems to narrow minded for me.<br>
Also, many seem to assume success is driven on money/wealth? I none of you actually believe this if you do- I’m sorry for you.</p>

Tell me then, how would you eat without money? How would you be able to do anything without having money? If you want to get educated, you need money. If you want a roof, you need money. Hell most of what's in this world is only available if you have the money to buy it. I am not, however, saying that money buys everything, just that without money you basically cripple yourself.

Yeah, there’s really no “pie”.  Other people just know how to keep this “unlimited” amount of wealth from the rest of the world.<br>
[/quote]<br>
So you’re saying rich people created poor people? What if while everyone was equal the poor just got lazy? WWWHHHAATTTT!? Poor people could have created rich people!?</p>
<p>Its all based on incentive and reward, socialism is for animals not humans.</p>
<p>(I interpreted your post as saying everyone is rich if there was no such thing as wealth)[/quote]I work my ass off and I’m still poor.  I work harder than any baseball player ever did, so I don’t really understand what you’re saying here.</p>
<p>I wasn’t even implying socialism or that everyone should have the same amount of money.  I think everyone should contribute what they can, etc.  And think about it: rich have an influence on the amount of poor people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This paragraph is based on a fallacy. Specifically, you assume that someone is poorer for having spent their money.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What do the poor spend their money on? Do they buy iPads? Bugatti’s? I doubt it. They buy the basic necessities, week after week. And when the end of the month comes, they have to pay their rent/mortgage. Don’t you agree with me that being poor means that after spending money on the aforementioned things, you don’t have much left? I know people who have to save for months to go to an amusement park, while someone like Bill Gates can buy the amusement park. Bill Gates won’t be poorer because he bought the amusement park (if it’s a decent park he’ll actually get richer), yet those who bought a ticket traded their labour, in the form of money, for a day of amusement.</p>
<p>They might feel enriched for a while. Poor people, unlike you and especially Frell think, actually work their balls off to pay their monthly costs and feed their children. Look at how many jobs a working class American has, a lot work double shifts daily. So a day in the amusement park can relieve stress, and they can relax again. This effect however wears off.</p>
<blockquote>Poorness: the state of having little or no money and few or no material possessions</blockquote>
<p>I say it again: Looking at the definition given, is someone that spent money on food not poorer? I know what you are trying to say, buying a car or book is exchanging money for wealth. But a car has a life of a few years, a book should increase your mental wealth. Food has/does nothing of the sorts. It feeds you, and you’ll need more the next day. There’s a certain threshold, if you fall below it you won’t be able to save up because you spend your money on those basic necessities. It’s almost impossible to get past that threshold, only those who are really creative will make it on their own. The rest needs help, and the government should give it in the form of education and a proper healthcare system.</p>
<p>I really don’t like the attitude of ‘the poor are poor because they are lazy’. Do you even have experience in the sectors the poor work in? After 8 hours of hard physical labour, you won’t have much energy left to study anything. As time goes by, you get older and studying becomes even harder. Africans are poor, do you believe a whole continent is occupied by lazy people? Mubarak and Khadaffi are rich, are they good hard working patriotic citizens who know their duties? Then why the hell are we attacking them? We should make statues of them, on honour of their greatness!</p>
<p>Sure, poor people have different moral standards, and seem like annoying pests. They sometimes drink, they swear all day, and turn to violence quite fast. But is this a cause, or a result? Nature, nurture, etc…</p>
<p>Dangerous and long quote to end:</p>
<blockquote>Let the reader try to picture the following:
<p>There is a lodging in a cellar and this lodging consists of two damp<br>
rooms. In these rooms a workman and his family live–seven people in<br>
all. Let us assume that one of the children is a boy of three years.<br>
That is the age at which children first become conscious of the<br>
impressions which they receive. In the case of highly gifted people<br>
traces of the impressions received in those early years last in the<br>
memory up to an advanced age. Now the narrowness and congestion of those<br>
living quarters do not conduce to pleasant inter-relations. Thus<br>
quarrels and fits of mutual anger arise. These people can hardly be said<br>
to live with one another, but rather down on top of one another. The<br>
small misunderstandings which disappear of themselves in a home where<br>
there is enough space for people to go apart from one another for a<br>
while, here become the source of chronic disputes. As far as the<br>
children are concerned the situation is tolerable from this point of<br>
view. In such conditions they are constantly quarrelling with one<br>
another, but the quarrels are quickly and entirely forgotten. But when<br>
the parents fall out with one another these daily bickerings often<br>
descend to rudeness such as cannot be adequately imagined. The results<br>
of such experiences must become apparent later on in the children. One<br>
must have practical experience of such a MILIEU so as to be able to<br>
picture the state of affairs that arises from these mutual<br>
recriminations when the father physically assaults the mother and<br>
maltreats her in a fit of drunken rage. At the age of six the child can<br>
no longer ignore those sordid details which even an adult would find<br>
revolting. Infected with moral poison, bodily undernourished, and the<br>
poor little head filled with vermin, the young ‘citizen’ goes to the<br>
primary school. With difficulty he barely learns to read and write.<br>
There is no possibility of learning any lessons at home. Quite the<br>
contrary. The father and mother themselves talk before the children in<br>
the most disparaging way about the teacher and the school and they are<br>
much more inclined to insult the teachers than to put their offspring<br>
across the knee and knock sound reason into him. What the little fellow<br>
hears at home does not tend to increase respect for his human<br>
surroundings. Here nothing good is said of human nature as a whole and<br>
every institution, from the school to the government, is reviled.<br>
Whether religion and morals are concerned or the State and the social<br>
order, it is all the same; they are all scoffed at. When the young lad<br>
leaves school, at the age of fourteen, it would be difficult to say what<br>
are the most striking features of his character, incredible ignorance in<br>
so far as real knowledge is concerned or cynical impudence combined with<br>
an attitude towards morality which is really startling at so young an<br>
age.</p>
<p>What station in life can such a person fill, to whom nothing is sacred,<br>
who has never experienced anything noble but, on the contrary, has been<br>
intimately acquainted with the lowest kind of human existence? This<br>
child of three has got into the habit of reviling all authority by the<br>
time he is fifteen. He has been acquainted only with moral filth and<br>
vileness, everything being excluded that might stimulate his thought<br>
towards higher things. And now this young specimen of humanity enters<br>
the school of life.</p>
<p>He leads the same kind of life which was exemplified for him by his<br>
father during his childhood. He loiters about and comes home at all<br>
hours. He now even black-guards that broken-hearted being who gave him<br>
birth. He curses God and the world and finally ends up in a House of<br>
Correction for young people. There he gets the final polish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, there’s really no “pie”.  Other people just know how to keep this “unlimited” amount of wealth from the rest of the world.</p>

</aside>
<p>So you’re saying rich people created poor people? What if while everyone was equal the poor just got lazy? WWWHHHAATTTT!? Poor people could have created rich people!?</p>
<p>Its all based on incentive and reward, socialism is for animals not humans.</p>
<p>(I interpreted your post as saying everyone is rich if there was no such thing as wealth)<br>
[/quote]I work my ass off and I’m still poor.  I work harder than any baseball player ever did, so I don’t really understand what you’re saying here.</p>
<p>I wasn’t even implying socialism or that everyone should have the same amount of money.  I think everyone should contribute what they can, etc.  And think about it: rich have an influence on the amount of poor people. [/quote]<br>
Sports players are where luck plays in, almost everyone works harder than them. But the thing is, they get paid by us to see the games.</p>
<p>Yes, the rich do have an influence on the poor, and the poor who don’t want to be poor any longer usually get out of it quickly.</p>
<p>You’re confusing people who ruined their life through dropouts and durgs with people who were the victims of luck.</p>
