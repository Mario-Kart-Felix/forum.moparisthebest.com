<p>Wrong, thats a charity.</p>
<p>A business’s AIM is to create profit.<br>
If they have the power to control the price of what they sell, then they have done very well for themselves, and are just doing BUSINESS.</p>

<p>It starts with an apparent mystery. At the end of 2006, food prices across the world started to rise, suddenly and stratospherically. Within a year, the price of wheat had shot up by 80 per cent, maize by 90 per cent, rice by 320 per cent. In a global jolt of hunger, 200 million people – mostly children – couldn’t afford to get food any more, and sank into malnutrition or starvation. There were riots in more than 30 countries, and at least one government was violently overthrown. Then, in spring 2008, prices just as mysteriously fell back to their previous level. Jean Ziegler, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, calls it “a silent mass murder”, entirely due to “man-made actions.”</p>

<p>I feel I need to say something.<br>
It’s useful idiots like Frell (and perhaps Rash, but I don’t know enough about his views) who allow stuff like this to happen. They allow corporations to only serve themselves. They even praise them when they make massive profits off the backs of exploited people.<br>
They share responsibility for the 200 million people from that article. I would go so far as to say that people like Frell (and maybe Rash) are murderers.</p>

<p>Basically people who buy contracts to buy/sell a product in the future. The speculators are buying futures and not selling them, which is the equivalent of hoarding, while the government lets it slide.</p>

Jean Ziegler, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, calls it “a silent mass murder”, entirely due to “man-made actions.”</p>

<p>I feel I need to say something.<br>
It’s useful idiots like Frell (and perhaps Rash, but I don’t know enough about his views) who allow stuff like this to happen. They allow corporations to only serve themselves. They even praise them when they make massive profits off the backs of exploited people.<br>
They share responsibility for the 200 million people from that article. I would go so far as to say that people like Frell (and maybe Rash) are murderers.[/quote]</p>
<p>If it was legal, yes.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.<br>
If you were the CEO of a company, and you had the power to control the prices of your commodities, would you not increase it?</p>

<p>Actually no. Im all for letting people frolic in their own wealth after slaving to invent something or finally starting a company after many failures and it grows, but I would never allow something like that to happen. I do not agree with taking money from success and “helping it to make the lives of people better”. However, I would expect any good business would use the profit to either give everyone raises, OR open up more work positions to take on more jobs. But thats my view on businesses, now for movie stars, music artists, sports players, and all those other people who rack up a shitton of money I think should be taxed heavily. But that will never happen here.</p>
<p>Market manipulation is a bit different… Sure bill gates could probably wipe out a small country but hes also one of the good business men who doesn’t have all the money sitting in his mattress. You dont punish every rich person because some dickhead gambled on food.</p>
<p>Once you use it to spread the wealth it will be good for about 5 years, then you start pulling the rich down as they start getting lazier because the government will inevitably start raising the tax more and more once they break the ice, and the poor will be just as poor just collecting the free money and blowing it off and not even using it to pull themselves out. You end up with a very flat society that is budget limited and always tight on money BECAUSE ITS NEVER THE POOR PELPES FAULT IF WE ARNT GIVIND THEM ENUF MONEY</p>
<p>The whole thing with welfare is great, <span class="bbcode-b">its the ones who are off of entitlement programs in 3 years that are the ones who needed it.</span></p>

<p>Thats retarded. Why the hell would you do that? If I sell peanuts and Yakman sells peanuts and I raise my prices guess who they’re going to go to? Besides, monopolies are illegal so you dont have much room to play with prices.</p>
<p>Yakman id say I trust people more than you with money. You’d have everyone in a country strapped down and could only spend money on what they need, and if they had any extra you give it to the poor. THERE WE GO EVERYONES HAPPY <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Till some kid who loves mechanics invents something in your country and comes to the US to sell it.</p>
<p>TIMBERRRR</p>
<p>You’d prefer to forcibly take money from the rich and give it to the poor, yet look at what they do. Oprah Winfrey and practically every movie star gives millions to charity a year, business men usually don’t because they have no money to hand out. But you’d still force them and let their company shrink.</p>

<p>There are other methods of running a country than the two you’ve talked about (anarcho-capitalism and communism)<br>
Why not attack what I actually believe instead of attacking a distorted version of what you think I believe.</p>
<p>Social democracy is what exists in some of mainland Europe. Its where the market is allowed to create wealth and wealth creators are rightly rewarded, however some of their wealth is taken from them and used for the betterment of everybody who wasn’t lucky enough to find oil (or whatever it might be). Also the market isn’t allowed to exploit people or destroy the environment. It’s certainly not allowed to cause people to starve to death.</p>
<p>edit: I should add, I believe in human rights and I think the power of the market should be used for the health and happiness of humankind. You guys seem to think that the market should be supported for its own ends.<br>
You realise the market has no thoughts and feelings, its an abstract entity. Humans are real and really suffer.<br>
Human rights before market tyranny. Always.</p>

<p>Im not attacking a distorted version of what you believe, I am attacking the result of what you believe. Once these types of acts start happening its all down hill. In 50 years they’ll be taking 15% more from the wealthy than they were before. The only reason it works partially now is because people had the wealth before it got like this. In 50 years rich wont be the same as rich now and people will be used to the style of living society provided them even at the bottom, and once you have a smaller amount of wealth in a country you’ll have to make cuts to compensate. Cuts lead to riots, and riots lead to Greece.</p>

<p>[quote=“Frell, post:29, topic:387096”]You’d have everyone in a country strapped down and could only spend money on what they need, and if they had any extra you give it to the poor.

<p>You’d prefer to forcibly take money from the rich and give it to the poor, yet look at what they do. Oprah Winfrey and practically every movie star gives millions to charity a year, business men usually don’t because they have no money to hand out. But you’d still force them and let their company shrink.[/quote]</p>

<p>Once these types of acts start happening its all down hill. In 50 years they’ll be taking 15% more from the wealthy than they were before. The only reason it works partially now is because people had the wealth before it got like this. In 50 years rich wont be the same as rich now and people will be used to the style of living society provided them even at the bottom, and once you have a smaller amount of wealth in a country you’ll have to make cuts to compensate. Cuts lead to riots, and riots lead to Greece.</p>

        <p>So you believe in destroying incentive.</p>
<p>Why try to make $1,000,000 a year if you only get $800,000 of it. And then people will say “well $800,000 is still alot of money”. Well… I could always move my business to ________ and I could get that extra money. Especially if its in bulk. $5,000,000 becomes $4,000,000 and so on.</p>
<p>What im trying to get is, I get why you believe in total wealth redistribution but why don’t you ever hold people accountable for their actions? If they screw up their life, they deserve a second chance which handouts and programs help them with. But alot of people don’t take advantage of it and collect it, do you still believe in redistributing to those people?</p>

Im all for letting everyone live a normal life and spreading the wealth but it has consequences. The market is always tied to poverty, thats why when you help the poor help themselves, and see little change, you go to the other end of the spectrum. The market.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve read this 5 times and still can’t make any sense of it. Its even more incomprehensible than your usual posts.[/quote]<br>
Governments spend money on programs that help people help themselves out of poverty. Like having a chance to get your high-school diploma after being dropped out of school for a few years. Governments set up loan programs to help people etc. These are all very very easy to come by if you don’t have a harsh criminal record.</p>
<p>What do you do when those people ignore those opportunities? You have to go back to feeding the free market to allow a more free flowing money circulation and more opportunities for everyone.</p>
<p>If you want to keep a high society in your country and keep it breathing, you can’t force everyone to be equal through wealth redistribution. 2% of the US population pays 80% of taxes. If our government did anything as extreme as wealth redistribution we would lose so much business and end up creating more poverty. The ones making the big bucks will dodge this bullet. The ones that remain in your country are only surviving because they have one foot in another door.</p>

        <p>Without poor people there would be no business. Likewise, without rich people there would be no business. There is supposed to be a balance between both, but I don’t see this happening in my country - rather the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I’m also not for complete wealth distribution, because the uneducated would just throw it around and go back to the previous state they were in, and the educated get the money they threw, and we’re back where we started. Assuming the uneducated get educated, everybody would aim for managerial positions in which ever company, and then there’d be nobody for the hard labor which is what most uneducated people do. Think about it like this: A business which looks to sell and install elevators would need people to move it and install the elevator in. These people who install the elevators are probably not going to be managers or people with high “ranks” so to speak in the company.</p>
