<p>Also, backing down on introducing a new tax isn’t the same as not enforcing an existing tax.</p>
<p>Sorry it took me so long to respond to that.</p>

              <p>So in summary, yeah its bad but There Is No Alternative.</p>
<p>Except there is, companies like John Lewis and Dyson produce good profits, pay their workers well and pay a fair amount of tax.<br>
Your argument is basically to allow the cheats and thieves to stay in the system instead of giving them an incentive to improve and become honest good companies.</p>
<p>Or I suppose I could turn around and tell you to stop complaining about government handouts to the poor because if you don’t feed them there would be riots on the streets. Unjust? Yeah, You may as well get used to it though, because that’s one perk of being many, you can achieve a lot if you focus yourself in one place.</p>
<p>Look at historical examples of the French and US revolution, look at today with the Egyptian and Tunisian uprisings. Now you rich people better keep paying your taxes, funding the welfare state and helping the poorest. Perhaps your taxes are best seen as a bribe :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Interesting, I remember the Australian government backing down on tax just last year!</p>
<blockquote>Introduced by Gillard's ousted predecessor Kevin Rudd in May, the bill has been fiercely opposed by the resources industry.
[...]
One of the largest concessions, the newspaper reports, was minimizing the application of the tax to existing projects. That would allow miners to determine the capital value of existing mines at market value.
The newspaper also said the government would scrap a proposed $1 billion exploration rebate...</blockquote>
http://www.upi.com/Science_News/Resource-Wars/2010/07/01/Australia-mining-tax-consensus-likely/UPI-17671278012817/
<p>Furthermore, I’d like to see mining companies move away from Australia. Take the rocks with them, why don’t they! I’d love to see a single telecommunications company (which apparently the entire country depends on) throw away massive profits just because their taxes are 15% instead of 10%. The shareholders would murder the directors for a start.<br>
Maybe you’re suggesting all the telecommunications companies will agree to move, but in that case, the one company that decides to stay gets 100% market share. Realistically, it just won’t happen. Capital flight is way over-hyped.</p>

              <p>Truth be told, if a company is too large to fail (ie, failure of the company will be to the detriment of society as a whole) then governments will probably do all that they can to keep it running.<br>
Unjust? Yeah. You may as well get used to it though, because that’s one perk of being huge – you can hold people, even governments, to ransom.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Australia has never given tax cuts or payments to businesses. They did give all recipients of welfare (including myself as a full-time student) a $900 bonus payment a year or two ago.<br>
I don’t particularly like the idea of a big company receiving a government payout, but what would you do if the country’s biggest bank or telecommunications provider just threw in the towel one day? The whole country stops working.</p>
<p>Corporate tax is reasonably high here, as are the wages that workers earn… someone working in a grocery store packing shelves at 21 years of age or more would earn something like $18 an hour or more with full-time work. The rate is higher for casual employees.</p>
<p>Some companies have decided to move their operations overseas, one notable example being a company called Bonds. That resulted in a lot of lost jobs, so it’s not unreasonable to suggest that overboard taxation and overly high wages for the blue collar worker leads to either a stagnant job market or, worse still, the axing of jobs and a declining job market.</p>
<p>Perhaps the payouts are better viewed as a bribe. :rolleyes:</p>

<p>It all boils down to the fact that economics are going to be shit for the next generation, regardless of people’s views.</p>

<p>After shrinking during the recession, paychecks are growing again for top American executives.</p>

<blockquote>HAPPY days are back — in the corner office, at least. 
<p>After shrinking during the 2008-9 recession, paychecks for top American executives are growing again — in many cases, significantly so.</p>
<p>Rarely has the view from the corner office seemed so at odds with the view from the street corner. At a time when millions of Americans are trying to hang on to homes and millions more are trying to hang on to jobs, the chief executives of major corporations like 3M, General Electric and Cisco Systems are making as much today as they were before the recession hit. Indeed, some are making even more.</p>
<p>The disparity is especially stark as companies are swimming in cash. In the fourth quarter, profits at American businesses were up an astounding 29.2 percent, the fastest growth in more than 60 years. Collectively, American corporations logged profits at an annual rate of $1.678 trillion.</p>
<p>So far, this recovery has not trickled down. After two relatively lean years, C.E.O.’s in finance, technology, energy and beyond are pulling down multimillion-dollar paychecks. What many of these executives aren’t doing, however, is hiring. Unemployment, although down from its peak, stood at 8.8 percent in March. And few economists predict the jobless rate will drop substantially anytime soon.</p>
<p>For the average C.E.O., however, the good times have returned. The median pay for top executives at 200 major companies was $9.6 million last year. That was a 12 percent increase over 2009, according to a study conducted for The New York Times by Equilar, a compensation consulting firm based in Redwood City, Calif.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some questions for you to think about.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>So the US has cut taxes for corporations and given other government handouts. We see massive profits as a result but <span class="bbcode-b">where are the promised jobs and pay rises</span> for the common man?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We see a lot of money floating around currently being used for CEO pay, would it be better to have <span class="bbcode-b">organised labour unions</span> that could demand some of this money in the form of <span class="bbcode-b">pay rises and jobs</span>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CEO of Viacom, Philippe P. Dauman, made $84.5 million in nine months.<br>
If we assume 4 weeks a month and 40 hours worked a week, that means he got paid <span class="bbcode-b">$58680 per hour</span>. (= 84.5 * 10^6 / 9 / 4 / 40)<br>
Given that the minimum wage in the US is <span class="bbcode-b">$7.25 per hour</span>, is that CEO really worth <span class="bbcode-b">8000 times</span> more? or is something rotten in the free market?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is neo-liberalism starting to look a bit exploitative? Might social democracy be better?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>“My party” Is for tax cuts on small business more than corporations, its was just suggested that now is not a good time to end the bush tax cuts.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter now, our tax regulating organizations and other lower government divisions are being shut down by Obama. God I can’t wait until 2013</p>

<p>I’m for government aid as long as it goes to the right people.<br>
Your party has given tax cuts for the people who need it least.</p>
<blockquote>Families earning more than $1 million a year saw their federal tax rates drop more sharply than any group in the country as a result of President Bush’s tax cuts, according to a new Congressional study.</blockquote>
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/08/washington/08tax.html
<p>In the end, the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest caused a large federal deficit and their continuation by Obama has done little to create jobs.</p>
<p>We also see thousands of the biggest corporations pay less tax as a percentage than the average guy on the street.</p>
<blockquote>You Pay More Money In Taxes Than Many Well-Known U.S. Corporations. [b]The 10 bucks in your pocket is more than many of the largest U.S. corporations paid in U.S. taxes[/b] including: Bank of America, Verizon, General Electric, Boeing, and Citigroup. Other companies like Federal Express and ExxonMobil pay effective rates of less than 10 percent (even though the official corporate tax rate is 35%). These same companies pay their CEOs and top managers millions in salary and perks – and spend millions lobbying the U.S. Congress for preferential tax and regulatory treatment.</blockquote>
http://www.ips-dc.org/articles/stop_corporate_tax_dodging_talking_points_and_background_information
<p>So in short, we see small businesses and workers shouldering most of the government burden while the very richest get handouts in the form of tax breaks and plane old tax dodging.</p>
<p>I wonder if Lothy will be consistent and condemn government handouts to the idle rich the same way he condemns government handouts to the idle poor. He is against government redistribution of wealth to the poor, but is he against government redistribution of wealth to the rich?</p>

              <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:92, topic:387096”]Sorry, guess I overlooked it. I’ve stated in other threads that I am a proponent of welfare.<br>
Nobody sits down one day and says to themselves ‘Right, I’m going to be a homeless person - I’m going to live outdoors on cold nights in the rain, be scruffy, starve, and wear rags’.<br>
That might sound funny after previous posts in this topic, but I don’t think I’ve said anywhere that I’m against taxation, welfare, etc.<br>
In fact, my thesis <em>only</em> points out the issue with the ‘pie theory’ that your graphs relied on to make a rather emotive argument. I don’t think my response advocates complete market freedom or the opposite.<br>
I’ve simply pointed out that money and wealth are not synonymous.[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh i see. In that case we agree quite a lot and there’s been a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:92, topic:387096”]I guess you could say that I’m against this Robin Hood attitude that a few of your recent posts have expressed. Your recent protest topic, as just one example, paints you as the type of guy that goes ‘well if I can’t have it then nobody else should either’, and then keys a nice sports car on the side of the road out of spite and jealousy.<br>
I don’t think that’s justice at all.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, reading over that last thread I realise it could be seen as that way, but that’s not what I think at all.<br>
In those protests specifically, I was very annoyed at the right wing government cutting things like schools, libraries and hospitals claiming there was no money anymore. At the same time they allowed rich people to not pay their taxes.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:92, topic:387096”]With regards to the birth lottery, there’s nothing you can do about it. At some stage you’re going to have to accept that you aren’t part of the British royal family, the heir of an oil tycoon, etc.<br>
And even though the heirs of these estates didn’t do anything, their forefathers did.<br>
How did the first royals come to be? They staked a claim - they told people that they were in charge, fought for it, etc, and ultimately lived to tell the tale.<br>
At some point in time, the forefathers of today’s wealthy were no more than regular people.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, it used to be much worse a few hundred years ago and the only reason it isn’t like that now is because of the progressive movements. For instance quite a big change happened a few years ago when hereditary peers were removed from the UK second chamber (that is, people who are only in the chamber because they inherited the title Lord from their dad)<br>
In France say, they actually had a big revolution a few centuries ago in protest. Since then they’ve had a much more egalitarian society and even today, they are a much fairer, in my view, society.</p>
