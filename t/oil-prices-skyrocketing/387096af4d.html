<p>True, that. Cheap education is shit here though, so I didn‚Äôt include that in my post.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúFrell, post:80, topic:387096‚Äù]Sports players are where luck plays in, almost everyone works harder than them. But the thing is, they get paid by us to see the games.</p>
<p>Yes, the rich do have an influence on the poor, and the poor who don‚Äôt want to be poor any longer usually get out of it quickly.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre confusing people who ruined their life through dropouts and durgs with people who were the victims of luck.[/quote]<br>
Why would a sports player be considered lucky? Is it because he got views to a game? Again, wealth is only measured by those around you. If the people were to choose so, sports would not be a way to make money.</p>

        <p>[quote=‚ÄúLothy, post:66, topic:387096‚Äù]Time for your post Yakman:<br>
First and foremost, the only ranking (and that‚Äôs what you have described - not a grade) given in high school here is the old UAI score, which is now referred to as an ATAR score I think.<br>
Indeed, the example doesn‚Äôt apply to this. This ranking is used for university entry, as there are a limited number of university places.</p>
<p>Everything else that I‚Äôve sat, however, has clearly marked grading brackets in terms of percentage correct ‚Äì in which case Frell‚Äôs analogy not only stands, but shines.<br>
Case in point: it is entirely possible for everyone in my university courses to get High Distinctions (the highest grade). They merely have to kick arse in the exam and assignments.<br>
It is also entirely possible for everyone to fail a course, and some courses have an extremely high attrition rate. They don‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúOh, you did really poorly but because you were in the top 10% of poor results, we‚Äôre going to pass you‚Äù.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am thoroughly overestimating the education systems in Britain and America, so if I am then you‚Äôll have to forgive me.<br>
Here in Australia we had testing organised by individual states (titled ‚ÄòBasic Skills Tests‚Äô), and these were used in years 3, 5, 7, and 9. They ensure that a standard is met and maintained by all students.<br>
Those who do poorly have their parents and teachers notified so that their game can be lifted.<br>
For what it‚Äôs worth, there is now a nationally organised test, and a website that allows all parents to view the details of a school (specifically its ability to educate, based on the ability of its students to pass exams).</p>
<p>We also have a rigid curriculum which applies to all public and private schools, and is controlled by a central board and bureaucratic process.<br>
Suffice it to say that, here in Australia, everyone has a chance to shine.<br>
If they skip school, that‚Äôs their doing ‚Äì and their parents can even be fined because of it.<br>
If they act silly in class, their doing.<br>
If they don‚Äôt do their homework and don‚Äôt have a legitimate reason (ie, abusive family), their doing.<br>
In my opinion, the poorer students have as much chance as richer students to make something of themselves.</p>
<p>My only beef with Australian high school is that there isn‚Äôt nearly enough critical thinking and analysis of things until the later years (10, 11, 12).<br>
I graduated from a catholic school, and it was fun advocating for things like abortion and euthanasia in religious studies (no, the teacher wasn‚Äôt a Texan or anything like that, so the class wasn‚Äôt backwards in its thinking).[/quote]</p>
<p>All brilliant. Australia has a progressive taxation system and high levels of social mobility.</p>
<p>Given that you‚Äôve seen how good it is, I have no idea why you want Australia to become a low tax, small state country. (Which is what you would support if you‚Äôre consistent with your views on economic freedom)</p>
<p>UK and US on the other hand. Very poor social mobility. Who your parents are matters much more than how good, hard-working or smart you are. Whenever anybody tries to fix it we hear the same arguments you‚Äôve been talking about. They say that these top people actually deserve all their wealth because they supposedly worked hard to get it. People seem unable to imagine that much of that didn‚Äôt come by fair means.</p>
<p>We see rich parents send their kids to expensive private schools, or live in expensive areas with good schools. They pay for private tutoring. They can pay for the best universities (especially now when the fees have just been tripled).<br>
All this conspires to make a system where the best, hard-working and smartest people don‚Äôt get on top as they deserve to, instead those on top only got there because of the accident of birth.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúLothy, post:66, topic:387096‚Äù][quote]<br>
Firstly, it depends on what you mean. Poor and rich can be measured relatively which would certainly mean that a rich person requires a poor person to exist.</p>
<p>Now, there‚Äôs two ways of someone becoming wealthier.</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating the wealth.</li>
<li>Getting it from someone else.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that my post showed that the wealth gained by the top 1% is almost exactly equal to the wealth lost by the bottom 80% which strongly suggests 2) happened. The burden of proof is on you to show that actually 1) happened, which you insinuate by saying ‚Äúthere no pie‚Äù, and you also have to explain where all the wealth from the bottom 80% went and why the numbers just happen (by coincidence presumably?) to be so similar.<br>
[/quote]<br>
This paragraph is based on a fallacy. Specifically, you assume that someone is poorer for having spent their money.[/quote]</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not a fallacy because it may or may not be true. Fallacy means its always not true.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre forced to buy something, especially from a monopoly or oligarchy then obviously you‚Äôll be ripped off. In my view that‚Äôs what happened in the US. Crony Capitalism it‚Äôs sometimes called.</p>
<p>How is someone meant to reframe from buying food, utilities or housing? In the UK for instance, just 6 companies control over 99% of the energy market and they can pretty much set arbitrary prices. Same with train companies. Your free market ideology will probably tell you that they‚Äôll try to compete with each other over price but it doesn‚Äôt happen because they seem to have formed a cartel and have influence in the government so it stays this way.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually it‚Äôs not jealously for me but a sense of justice.<br>
I see people who didn‚Äôt work hard get rewarded just because, by the accident of birth, they had rich parents. It doesn‚Äôt sound very fair to me and I suspect it doesn‚Äôt to you.</p>
<p>I think your problem is you think removing all taxes and governments, giving everybody maximum economic freedom will lead to that fairness. That‚Äôs not true as I hope you‚Äôve seen from my last posts. It leads to crony capitalism.<br>
rich parents pay for private tutoring</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúLothy, post:66, topic:387096‚Äù]With regards to the image on economic growth, why shouldn‚Äôt the top 1% control the most?<br>
The top 1% of actors probably make 99% of the films worth watching, and the top 1% of musicians probably make 99% of the music that people <span class="bbcode-b">want to hear</span>.<br>
This is key. It‚Äôs not always about what‚Äôs ‚Äògood‚Äô by your subjective standards.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well I dispute those numbers but understand your point anyway.<br>
The reason the top 1% shouldn‚Äôt control more than the lower 80% is because we see in the US that they‚Äôre not worth that much in reality. They got it by lobbying governments to make laws for their benefit that are actually detrimental to a free market and the world as a whole. For example in the US the environmental regulation that protect the air, water, food and health are being attacked politically. All because these companies want to make an easy profit instead of working harder to make a profit by actually producing something. source: <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/150040/get_ready%3A_the_gop_has_declared_war_on_the_environment?akid=6574.208793.VbP2BU&amp;rd=1&amp;t=8" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.alternet.org/story/150040/get_ready%3A_the_gop_has_declared_war_on_the_environment?akid=6574.208793.VbP2BU&amp;rd=1&amp;t=8</a></p>

</aside>
<p>You‚Äôre an economic liberal, rather than a social liberal, its clear to me.<br>
Now I appreciate you‚Äôve never used the words ‚Äòfree market‚Äô or anything like that, but I can tell by your rhetoric that if you read around the subject and continued your line of thoughts you‚Äôd reach that conclusion.<br>
We‚Äôve seen in other countries, for example Chile under Pinochet, that economic liberty is incompatible with social, political and personal liberty. Pinochet was setting up a country solely based on neo-liberal doctrine and found he had to roll back democracy, suppress political opposition and labour unions under a reign of terror and widespread human rights abuses. It was pure market tyranny. source: <a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-chichile.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-chichile.htm</a></p>
<p>If you ask me, political, social and personal freedoms (which affect real people capable of suffering and happiness) are much more important than the free market that you‚Äôre advocating (which although useful, is still just an abstract idea).</p>
<p>I notice you haven‚Äôt responded to this.</p>
<blockquote>Then there's also the moral issues of allowing somebody to starve to death just because the economy happens to be in recession and they couldn't find a job, or because they were unlucky enough to become ill. Half of all bankruptcies in the US were caused by illness and medical bills. So what if you're a really great, hard-working, smart guy who just accidentally got cancer? Isn't it much better for a social democracy to give free healthcare to everybody which allows really smart, hard-working but unlucky people to rise to the top?</blockquote>
<p>Your system would allow people to die on the street. It allows good businesses to go bust, not because they are not hard-working or smart, but because their owner was unlucky enough to get ill.</p>

Sorry, guess I overlooked it. I've stated in other threads that I am a proponent of welfare.
Nobody sits down one day and says to themselves 'Right, I'm going to be a homeless person - I'm going to live outdoors on cold nights in the rain, be scruffy, starve, and wear rags'.
That might sound funny after previous posts in this topic, but I don't think I've said anywhere that I'm against taxation, welfare, etc.
In fact, my thesis *only* points out the issue with the 'pie theory' that your graphs relied on to make a rather emotive argument. I don't think my response advocates complete market freedom or the opposite.
I've simply pointed out that money and wealth are not synonymous.
<p>The bit about it not being a fallacy: I suppose I agree with you regarding utilities, but I would say that your point of contention is the exception, not the norm.</p>
<p>Also, don‚Äôt get the wrong idea. I‚Äôm socially liberal - I support things like same sex marriage, euthanasia, abortion, and so on.<br>
Of course, I‚Äôd also be happy to see someone blow Fred Phelps‚Äô brains out. I wonder where that places me in the political spectrum.<br>
Anyway, my opinion at the end of the day is that a person should be able to do whatever they want with themselves so long as it doesn‚Äôt infringe on another‚Äôs rights (except people like Fred Phelps, heh) - even if that does mean injecting themselves with nembutal and so on.</p>
<p>I guess you could say that I‚Äôm against this Robin Hood attitude that a few of your recent posts have expressed. Your recent protest topic, as just one example, paints you as the type of guy that goes ‚Äòwell if I can‚Äôt have it then nobody else should either‚Äô, and then keys a nice sports car on the side of the road out of spite and jealousy.<br>
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs justice at all.</p>
<p>With regards to the birth lottery, there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. At some stage you‚Äôre going to have to accept that you aren‚Äôt part of the British royal family, the heir of an oil tycoon, etc.<br>
And even though the heirs of these estates didn‚Äôt do anything, their forefathers did.<br>
How did the first royals come to be? They staked a claim - they told people that they were in charge, fought for it, etc, and ultimately lived to tell the tale.<br>
At some point in time, the forefathers of today‚Äôs wealthy were no more than regular people.</p>

That might sound funny after previous posts in this topic, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve said anywhere that I‚Äôm against taxation, welfare, etc.<br>
In fact, my thesis <em>only</em> points out the issue with the ‚Äòpie theory‚Äô that your graphs relied on to make a rather emotive argument. I don‚Äôt think my response advocates complete market freedom or the opposite.<br>
I‚Äôve simply pointed out that money and wealth are not synonymous.[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh i see. In that case we agree quite a lot and there‚Äôs been a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúLothy, post:92, topic:387096‚Äù]I guess you could say that I‚Äôm against this Robin Hood attitude that a few of your recent posts have expressed. Your recent protest topic, as just one example, paints you as the type of guy that goes ‚Äòwell if I can‚Äôt have it then nobody else should either‚Äô, and then keys a nice sports car on the side of the road out of spite and jealousy.<br>
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs justice at all.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, reading over that last thread I realise it could be seen as that way, but that‚Äôs not what I think at all.<br>
In those protests specifically, I was very annoyed at the right wing government cutting things like schools, libraries and hospitals claiming there was no money anymore. At the same time they allowed rich people to not pay their taxes.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúLothy, post:92, topic:387096‚Äù]With regards to the birth lottery, there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. At some stage you‚Äôre going to have to accept that you aren‚Äôt part of the British royal family, the heir of an oil tycoon, etc.<br>
And even though the heirs of these estates didn‚Äôt do anything, their forefathers did.<br>
How did the first royals come to be? They staked a claim - they told people that they were in charge, fought for it, etc, and ultimately lived to tell the tale.<br>
At some point in time, the forefathers of today‚Äôs wealthy were no more than regular people.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, it used to be much worse a few hundred years ago and the only reason it isn‚Äôt like that now is because of the progressive movements. For instance quite a big change happened a few years ago when hereditary peers were removed from the UK second chamber (that is, people who are only in the chamber because they inherited the title Lord from their dad)<br>
In France say, they actually had a big revolution a few centuries ago in protest. Since then they‚Äôve had a much more egalitarian society and even today, they are a much fairer, in my view, society.</p>

        <p>So you will soon have insurance covered by your job?</p>
<p>get a loan?</p>
<p>Im seriously interested in this now because if we hit a dead end with this bickering then our shitly defined government should be aiding you</p>
<p>You misinterpreted my sig, the poor have been voting democrat for 60 years hoping for help, either that help never came (ha doubt it), or they aren‚Äôt helping themselves to any of the available government programs. Excellent example!: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P36x8rTb3jI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P36x8rTb3jI</a> (notice her shopping probably with her highschool mistakes, sorry I mean children)</p>
<p>Before this goes any farther I want you to know im for government aid as long as it is going to the right people, I just have a problem when people discuss how to help more people instead of filtering out the ones leeching off the system. <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/146984/Adults-Government-Health-Insurance.aspx">http://www.gallup.com/poll/146984/Adults-Government-Health-Insurance.aspx</a> All going to the older generation (not calling them leechers, they‚Äôre old) for social security, which is why I think it should be increased to the age of 70. The money could be going to the bottom where people need the lift to fix their mistakes early.</p>
