    <title>Looking for interest</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-interest/533456</link>
    <description>I&#39;m considering starting up a host. I would be able to offer decently sized VPSs for a decent price. For example, $50 for 4GB dedicated ram, 10TB bandwidth (100Mbps uplink) and 125GB storage. I could also optionally add 5Gbps/1000k pps ddos protection for $200 extra or 10Gbps/2000k pps for $300 extra. These are just my opening thoughts, and rough examples. VPSs would use xen virtualisation and the servers themselves would NOT be oversold. After some time I would also commit to upgrading each server to use SSD drives for an added speed boost free of charge to all customers, assuming the business does well. I would also be willing to provide new server owners with advice for free, as a long time server owner myself. For example, I can teach new server owners how to set up their server to run on a Linux environment, which will save new owners money by not having to pay an extra windows rental fee or w\e. Not to mention, Linux is just overall better than windows.

Any thoughts/suggestions/interest? I don&#39;t want to actually commit to this without some level of interest</description>

              <p>I’m not targeting the rsps community, but that doesn’t mean I won’t allow users to host their servers on it. If someone decides to host copyrighted content downloads, I will obviously comply to any DMCA complaint, but if all you’re hosting is the actual game server, there’s not going to be any problems there for either myself or the owner.</p>
<p>The only thing I didn’t describe about the physical servers are the processors. Each server would have an Intel Xeon E3-1270v2 chip. In case you don’t want to google up the specs on that, you get 8M cache, 3.5Ghz with turbo boost up to 3.9Ghz and 4 cores with 8 threads. As for the prices, they seem quite fair to me, but then again I haven’t been looking into VPSs in the last two years as I only use dedi’s myself.</p>
<p>You would be signing up for a VPS, so you’d be renting, not owning the server. I thought that would be common sense, you can’t own something you’re sharing with other VPS users. &gt;.&gt; It would also be unmanaged. You get root access and you’re responsible for setting everything up.</p>

              <p>[quote=“hadesflames, post:5, topic:533456”]Don’t worry about those details. I’m willing to see it through, but not unless there’s interest for it. I’m looking to see if people like the prices for what they get, the model and whether or not they’d actually buy it when/if it’s released.[/quote]I think in the current storm of text you have it would be hard to judge if those are “fair” prices. You have not told us the specs of these servers nor have you told us if this is managed or non-managed. if we would own the server or if it’s just renting. etc etc</p>
<p>I should also point out that a dedicated server/vps company that directors for the most part to rsps will fail no hands down.</p>
