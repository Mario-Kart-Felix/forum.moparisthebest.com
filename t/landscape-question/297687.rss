              <p>Well first, I’d advise you to get the RSC Community Landscape Editor by xEnt/Vrunk/Peter if you don’t already have it as it’s the most user friendly landscape editor. It’s kind of outdated so it doesn’t have all the textures, and elevation is a little difficult since it’s not a 3-D editor.</p>
<p>Anyway, first thing you want to do is find a Landscape file from your server (make a backup of it incase you mess up the first). Next, open up the Landscape file in your editor and find a good section where you want to start fresh. Once you find the section you wish to erase, use the ‘Delete Tile’ tool under Brushes and go over all the landscape (this can be a bit tedious as you can only go over one tile at a time). After that, your landscape should be all gray with no textures, overlays, elevation or anything. Incase you don’t want to have to delete all the tiles again, save your landscape, open up your Landscape file with winRar or another extractor, find the sector (example: h0x51x50) you saved and drag it out somewhere you can find it. Copy and paste it and rename one of them to another sector you want to start fresh with, then replace it in your Landscape file and your sector should be all fresh too. This saves alot of time rather than going over each tile again. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Now you should be able to go and make your own landscapes from blank!</p>
<p>Please forgive my long posts, I’m not so good at explaining short answers because I try to find ways to make it understandable so if you need more explaining or don’t understand what I wrote, I will certainly attempt to rephrase everything.</p>
<p>EDIT: I hear liquidazer is good with landscape editing so if you have any further questions, try asking him through PM. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
