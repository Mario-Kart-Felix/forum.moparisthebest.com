    <title>Landscape Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/landscape-question/386843</link>
    <description>Hi there, just recently i&#39;ve been doing a lot of 3d modeling in blender, it helped me get a much better grasp on the 3d concept and how it works, If somebody here could take the time to give a brief explanation how the RSC landscape is made/stored, I have a couple of questions which are;

-it&#39;s all done in tiles right? so that means each tile contains 4 vertices ? 
-how is it all stored, point coordinates, tile colours ect, i understand you have
the landscape.rscd, and the sectors inside, but whats in each sector and tile?
I want to extract the data so I can display it in another 3d program basicly, and get more of an idea on how 3d map data is stored and rendered.
just need a rundown .. is the landscape/tile colours/3d objects/wall textures ect all seperate?

i don&#39;t have alot of java experience so I find it difficult to look through landscape editors and source code, but if I have too i will.

thanks</description>
