    <title>RSCUnderworld, soon coming to a world near you!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscunderworld-soon-coming-to-a-world-near-you/410175</link>
    <description>Hello, RSCUnderworld is a server that has been in development for a while now, and the team and I believe we are finally at the stage of almost having a source ready to release a real RuneScape Classic private server, RSCUnderworld.

The base of the server is RSCUnderworld&#39;s source, we are not using RSCD/RSCA etc. We have created this source from scratch and have been developing it for months.

The source is very advanced and uses an API called Netty. The server uses a script engine, which is made in pure java and can be recalled by the server at anytime, which means we can make updates and changes to the server without a system restart.

The server has many advanced features than any other runescape classic private server such as sending PM’s from forum to game and PM’s from game to forum by clicking on a offline player, this system allows you to send PM’s to offline players in-game.

We have changed the way landscapes are loaded, into a height system. By doing this there can be more than 1 game running in one area at the same time without interacting with the other games that are running.

Clan systems will have options to share exp, if you want to share exp with clan mates in the same section as you, you can. This can be done through the site, which can be updated at any time. 

RSCUnderworld will have no commands in game at all and everything can be done via the site to give it the real runescape classic game-play.

We have rewrote the core to fluxbb to integrate our own SEO plug in, this plug in shows better search engine ranks on Google, Yahoo and Bing. By doing this all threads and accounts will appear on any search engine by a simple search even if someone is not searching for rscunderworld and searches for Runescape Classic, RSCUnderworld will be found.
Read more about SEO here (Search engine optimization) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization

The server&#39;s XP rate will be 4x &amp; it will be P2P based. There will NOT be any custom weapons and Armour, it will be purely RSC based.

Staminus will host us on a dedicated server with DDoS protection.

Estimated time of release: 1 week

For further news &amp; updates on the server visit our forums
In the Signature Below !!!

Feel free to ask questions, haters will be ignored.</description>

<p>@ RSCUn, you don’t have much time left before I just ban you (and trust me, you’re getting banned even if you’re right. If you want to contact me after that you can do it via IRC), but I want to get to the bottom of this. When I do the same thing, it just tells me the password is incorrect, no message like that…[/quote]May you PM me the IRC details.</p>

              <p>@ Luke - Why does one say ‘Payment for’ and the other say ‘Payment to’? I don’t use paypal much, so what does it mean?</p>
<p>@ RSCUn, you don’t have much time left before I just ban you (and trust me, you’re getting banned even if you’re right. If you want to contact me after that you can do it via IRC), but I want to get to the bottom of this. When I do the same thing, it just tells me the password is incorrect, no message like that…</p>
