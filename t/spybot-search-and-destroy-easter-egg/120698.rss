    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/spybot-search-and-destroy-easter-egg/120698</link>
    <description> For those of you who have a copy of spybot search and destroy you may or may not have played the game hidden within it. If you are bored whilst scanning for spyware on your machine you can amuse yourself by playing a little game hidden within the program.

To access the easter egg just click on the small binoculars on the top left of the screen. The object of the game is to uncover all the numbers and reveal the hidden picture underneath.
