    <title>Need help jarring a client so it can be a webclient! Will pay if it works good!</title>

    <description>I have been trying to do it myself but my head is about to explode.  I got a jar made and everything but it said &quot;Error Loading-please report!) I think what I did wrong is I didn&#39;t change the cache download link in the cachedownloader, because the link in there was broken, and I have no idea how to put a cache onto a website.(Trying to figure this out also almost made my head explode.)  So if someone could please help me I would be very grateful and if the webclient works fine and everything I will pay you! Please add my MSN: gabrielthomashall@gmail.com</description>

<p>If you forgot to do that. I suggest: uploading your cache to <a href="http://www.webs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.webs.com/</a> . make a website from there. make the cache a zip folder or rar. (it doesn’t matter) and upload it to your site. give people the link and tell them where to put the cache.</p>
