    <title>Need help jarring a client so it can be a webclient! Will pay if it works good!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-jarring-a-client-so-it-can-be-a-webclient-will-pay-if-it-works-good/413261</link>
    <description>I have been trying to do it myself but my head is about to explode.  I got a jar made and everything but it said &quot;Error Loading-please report!) I think what I did wrong is I didn&#39;t change the cache download link in the cachedownloader, because the link in there was broken, and I have no idea how to put a cache onto a website.(Trying to figure this out also almost made my head explode.)  So if someone could please help me I would be very grateful and if the webclient works fine and everything I will pay you! Please add my MSN: gabrielthomashall@gmail.com</description>
