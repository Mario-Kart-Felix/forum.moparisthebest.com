    <description>yes im useing the repot abuse as a request update/appeal mod thing and i want it so that when then type in the text and select a opt like they would in the real rs but so it reads the +rule and sends a message to every 1 saying if it was rule0 request update rule1 appeal to be a mod and rule 3 appeald to be adminstrator,
here is the code i have,

[code]        	bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;Update Requests/&quot;+playerName+&quot;.txt&quot;, true));
bw.write(playerName+&quot; Has requested a update !&quot;);
	bw.newLine();
	bw.write(&quot;What Rule = &quot;+rule);
	bw.newLine();
	bw.write(receivedPlayerName+&quot;&quot;);
	bw.newLine();
	bw.newLine();
	bw.write(&quot;====================&quot;);
	bw.newLine();
	bw.write(&quot;rule 0 = update request&quot;);
	bw.newLine();
	bw.write(&quot;rule 1 = mod appeal&quot;);
	bw.newLine();
	bw.write(&quot;rule 2 = admin appeal&quot;);
	bw.newLine();
	bw.flush();
sendMessage(&quot;Thank-You , we received your update request!&quot;);
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = (playerName+&quot; : requested rule=&quot; +rule);[/code]

but insted of requested rule=,

i wanted something like if they selected opt 1 it says
[code]playerHandler.messageToAll = (playerName+&quot; : requested a update!&quot;);[/code]

and if  they selected opt 2 it would be
[code]playerHandler.messageToAll = (playerName+&quot; : appealed to be a mod!&quot;);[/code]
 
and opt 3 would be
[code]PlayerHandler.messageToAll = (playerName+&quot; : appealed to be a Admin!:);[/code]

but insted of having it messaged to every one i want it to be messaged to just me,</description>
