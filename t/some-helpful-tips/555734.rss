    <description>As I am sure everyone is aware this is totally different compared to smf. But it also has a bunch of cool features that we didn&#39;t have before.

* Hitting just Categories bring them up like they would display on smf.

* You can set your email up so you get messaged when a new post has been made, after which you can post right from your email account.

* In Unread you can get rid of your 3,200+ unread in seconds by purging them all, you also have the option to not follow them again in the same box.

* You can continue to read different posts while writing a reply to another thread! @sk8rdude461 

* If you go to the user tag in the drop down menu, to the left is a filter for different time periods. So you can search by quarter or even just go back to all time and see who the best is!
