    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;MADISON, Wis. — A federal safety official says a preliminary investigation suggests the death of a Monster Truck show promoter from Ohio was an accident.

Kim Stille, director of the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration&#39;s office in Madison, Wis., says her agency&#39;s investigation has not turned up any obvious safety issues. She says the investigation continues but &quot;it does appear to be a tragic accident.&quot;

Authorities say 41-year-old George Eisenhart Jr. of Chardon, Ohio, died on Saturday night when he stepped into the path of one of the huge trucks during the Motor Sports Monster Truck &amp; Thrill Show.

Coroner John Stanley says preliminary investigation shows neither the victim nor the driver saw each other before the collision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
