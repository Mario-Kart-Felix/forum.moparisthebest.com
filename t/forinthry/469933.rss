    <description>Meaning of the word Forinthry: http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Forinthry

[b]Synopsis[/b]
There are 100 random locations scattered across the Wilderness, and every [i]new[/i] player logs in at a random spot. They must roam the wilderness for items and supplies to survive. If they come across another player they can obviously choose whether to kill them for their items, become an alliance or leave them alone completely.

Currently, the area surrounding the Wilderness is an infected area (still in development), any player who ventures below the Y coordinate of 3482 will become entangled by a vine and be teleported back to their last known location ([url=http://i1326.photobucket.com/albums/u654/Tmesis_Forinthry/forbidden.gif]image[/url]).

Edgeville bank is quarantine, effectively the only safe spot available. As the world is expanded there will be other safe areas (quarantines) but not every where below the Wilderness will be safe. Players may choose to commit crimes (assault, murder etc.) outside of the Wilderness to other players, but there will of course be consequences, making the game much more difficult to be in, encouraging you to be a good citizen (but of course you may choose the life of treachery and crime).

[b]Notable Features[/b]
[size=7pt]*already came with the source | *added by myself[/size]

-Fully clipped game (NPC walking, attacking, player following, NPC following)
-If you click a NPC, and the NPC moves from it&#39;s original tile, you will still walk to the NPC and complete the action in one click
-Very good combat

-Aggressive and non aggressive monsters that return to their original location if they stray too far:

[b]Ideas[/b]
I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about current servers and their game play. The mentality seems to be log in, train some skills and kill some monsters for the same old items. I do enjoy those types of servers but I&#39;ve grown tired of wanting to replicate the same game play over and over. Forinthry is going to be something new in all aspects, but still containing some original concepts such as cutting some trees for some wood, bank, repeat etc.

Some initial ideas I have are (these are just ideas and not necessarily features implemented):

[ul][li]Longer ground item times (6 minutes instead of the original 2)[/li][/ul]

This gives more variety of items to be discovered by other players in the event of a death. 


[ul][li]Survival based, but still cater for the skillers[/li][/ul]

Pure skilling is still a fun part of every server, and should be considered when designing your game play aspects. There will be a diverse range of ways to train each skill, and markets will always be taken into account (i.e. not ridiculous shops). 

Economy is key, but without making the game too tedious that it becomes a drag to train your skills and you have no use for the items created (i.e. glass blowing will be useful for mass vial/orb production).


[ul][li]Dense population for every significant location within the Wilderness[/li][/ul]

It&#39;s about making it worth while to navigate through the Lava Maze, or venture to the Dark Castle etc. Everywhere, there will be items to loot, monsters to interact with and secrets to discover. If you are the ruthless hunter who preys on the helpless, the modest hero that helps the weak, or the noble adventurer who wants a piece of everything, there will always be something for you to do.


[ul][li]Notifications of nearby activity[/li][/ul]

Maybe through a quest or item you find. You may be rewarded with the ability to unlock &quot;Instinct&quot;, a sixth sense, to sense danger or vulnerability nearby. The way it will work is there will be an invisible radar surrounding each player (maybe 2 screen across, 2 screens wide).

[IMG]http://i1326.photobucket.com/albums/u654/Tmesis_Forinthry/radar.png[/img]

[b]Example 1:[/b] You are level 70. 2 other players are level 90 and level 100. They are off screen and are [b]not in combat[/b]. You will receive a message such as &quot;Potential danger ahead. Status: idle. Approach with caution.&quot;.

[b]Example 2:[/b] You are level 70. 2 other players are level 40 and level 50. They are off screen and are [b]currently engaged in combat[/b]. You will receive a message such as &quot;Anomalies detected. Status: hostile. No immediate threat.&quot;.

Example 1 suggests a player has been detected that is stronger than you (combat level based assumption). Example 2 suggests a player has been detected that is weaker than you (combat level based assumption). Of course, the level 40 and 50 , if they were allies, could potentially overcome the rouge level 70, but as they are engaged in combat you would of course assume that they are not friends.

This system would more than likely be a reward from a semi hard task, with some sort of [url=http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Magical_orb]orb[/url] you need to have in your inventory for it to be enabled. With a lot of players online you would more than likely be spammed, so the item would have to be clicked for it to display a message.


[ul][li]Barrows[/li][/ul]

Players will dig on the hill at level 14 wild.

[IMG]http://i1326.photobucket.com/albums/u654/Tmesis_Forinthry/level_14.png[/img]

This will take players to the Barrows&#39; tunnels. After navigating to the center chest, they must click on the chest to summon all 6 brothers at once. You must be able to defeat all 6 whilst under attack my all 6 (multi combat). You would of course have to pray melee for Dharok. whilst tanking Karil&#39;s bolts, whilst getting hit by Ahrim&#39;s fire. Verac would also be hitting through your prayer occasionally making potential hits of 60+ if all the brothers hit you at the same time. The order in which you kill them will also greatly effect your chances of beating the Barrows minigame.

Also, players will have the ability to attack other players inside the Barrows minigame. To avoid campers ruining your day completely, they will also have to activate the chest. If they do not, then the camera will shake and rocks will fall, slowly killing the player. This puts a stop to people camping the chest and killing players trying to complete the minigame (but still adds the factor of pvp danger).

Hopefully this will make players value Barrows as some of the best armour in game. The rewards won&#39;t be common, but won&#39;t be too rare either. I may add a system that guarantees you a piece of armour if you haven&#39;t received one randomly within 4-5 trips.

[b]Progress Log[/b]
-Fixed the message &quot;You&#39;re already doing an emote&quot; when you wasn&#39;t doing anything
-Fixed incorrect emotes
-Quest interface now updates dynamically
-NPC spawn command spawns the npc and writes it to the config file automatically (::n id maxhit attack defence)
-Players restricted to Edge and the Wilderness for the time being (via simple coordinate checking)

[b]Credits[/b]
The source I am using is the RS317 source. Originally a remake, it has so many features and so many key components already implemented (i.e. clipping, following, combat, stability etc.) that it is definitely one of the best sources to use, feature wise.</description>

<p>There’s also a section where Ogres are caged on Training Grounds and can be fired upon by Players using these bows. This used to be considered a decent way to train your Ranged Skill in RuneScape. You should fill the Cage Area with Ogres which don’t attack back (let them still follow the Player though it just looks better). It’s as simple as adjusting a variable. I believe this area is called “King Lathas’ Training Grounds” or something to that effect.</p>
<p>Just some more Ogre Content for you.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Btw, RS317 claims to be a winterLove framework with the stability of Hyperion, but as soon as I opened the source for the first time I could tell it was based on PI. It had the same files and the same default character, so I was disappointed that it resembled PI in so many ways.</p>
<p>I usually use Hyperion and Shard so when you see getPA() it does not necessarily mean I’m a fan of PI.</p>

<p>On Topic: Spamming  your Thread a little bit here, but I’ll give you some kewl advice as well. You see how your Player-Character goes through the Agility course as if something is off when they run through objects and such?
