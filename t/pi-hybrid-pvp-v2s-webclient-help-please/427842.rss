    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-hybrid-pvp-v2s-webclient-help-please/427842</link>
    <description>[font=verdana][size=12pt]Okay so i have followed the intructions what feels like a million times now, and i can pretty much do it with a blinde fold on.. Now im either completely missing something, or there is something reallly wrong ? 

Ive got to the point where im just tired of it now, and i think what i need is for someone who knows what they are doing to take a look for me :/ 

If anyone could spare some time to give me a hand it would be much appreciated... Ive got everything done, i guess i just need someone to check its all right?

anyways my msn is Vinxy@hotmail.co.uk if anyone wants to give us a hand. Thanks!  :D[/size][/font]</description>
