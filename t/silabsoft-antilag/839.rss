    <description>Having lag on your server have no fear miss silabsoft here with the fix it has made my server run lag free for a hour  which is record. THIS IS FOR WHITESCAPE BASED SERVERS ONLY

This code has a real story and was a huge pain the code was written by me first but didnt work so i had rictoo look at it and he re wrote it and re wrote and re wrote it again and still nothing then he finally got a working version so i was happy but then i realised it caused more problems than it fixed do too it opening alot of servers.  i then remade it again and took out a big chunk of it which was causing more problems than it fixed and now its flawless.  remember if you rep me rep rictoo  also because he had the patients too help me with it and his code helped me fix it.


this dosnt fix connection lag this fixes the lag of the server running for awhile..
