    <title>[Client help] Need help with customizing client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-help-need-help-with-customizing-client/406406</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, I&#39;ve recently made a little server for me and some friends And I was wondering how to customize the client. I did customize the background But I was wondering how to customize the color of the text when it says &quot;unpacking blah blah blah&quot; and also the little red bar that loads. And Also if someone could help me the client I have it is from the client One-Scape and I was wondering how to change the text at the very top that say One-Scape client V5.5 . Thank you.
