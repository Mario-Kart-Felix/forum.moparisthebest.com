    <title>Megaupload Shutdown?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/megaupload-shutdown/429872</link>
    <description>Megaupload was shut down and the owner&#39;s were sued today. The reason it was taken down for was copyright infringement, which is stupid since you can&#39;t help that if you&#39;re Megaupload. They should have just sued the uploader, but w/e.

<p>you can do that if you really want to but a dmca is filed under penalty of perjury, if you don’t own the copyright(or even if you do) the person who had the video can issue a counter notice and if it isn’t resolved then and there they can take you to the courts to decide</p>

<p>youtube cannot decides who owns what copyright, they must take the video down (provided the dmca is filed correctly etc etc) and let the video owner decide if it wants to stay down or let them file a counter notice and possibly take it to the courts</p>
<p>of course there’s nothing stopping you going around filing false dmcas other than the very real threat of getting fucked over in a court for it</p>

<p>I highly doubt they’re just going to go on a blind rage of take-down notices, and even then, you saw how Jagex filed a DMCA takedown towards Moparisthebest, he hasn’t taken anything down and we are still operating!</p>

<p>Usually they ignore us because we aren’t the ones who own the copyright material. But if you make a video with you and your friends and post it to youtube, and another person re-uploads it, then you can claim it as yours and they can take it down. But if you are reporting someone else for uploading content that doesn’t belong to you or them, they will bypass it.</p>

<p>it isn’t funny or strange provided they comply with all dmca takedown notices and have a legal requirement to do so</p>
<p>illegal songs and videos get uploaded to youtube all the time and as long as the copyright holder or someone on behalf of the copyright holder doesn’t file a takedown notice there’s no legal requirement to take it down, the only thing that matters is the takedown notice is upheld and that youtube leaves the decisions of who owns the copyright to the courts and not take it into their own hands</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>well actually, you can help it, and are legally required to “help it”</p>
<p>you see, should you own the copyright to a song and a website is hosting it illegally, you can file a dmca takedown notice to that website to have the content removed</p>
<p>that website has 2 options, take the content down and keep their safe harbour status, or they can keep the content up and take full liability for the illegally hosted material</p>
<p>in a nutshell megaupload chose the second option and didn’t remove the illegally hosted material</p>
<p>[quote=“New fag, post:5, topic:429872”]There is nothing illegal for getting legal money through legal means for providing a legal service.<br>
If we follow that principle on which MU is taken down is Google next then?[/quote]</p>
<p>the illegal part comes from megaupload ignoring the dmca takedown notices therefore giving up their safe harbour status</p>
<p>if youtube kept a video up after receiving a dmca takedown then the same thing could happen to youtube, it’s not a case of big bad government and copyright holders going after an innocent website</p>

<p>they DON’T need to monitor every upload, the part where a hosted song becomes illegal is when the copyright holder sends a notice to the website stating they believe the material to be illegally hosted and requiring the website to take it down, should the website not take it down the website waives any safe harbour rights and take FULL RESPONSIBILITY for ALL HOSTED MATERIAL</p>

<p>yes there are ways to remove copyrighted content from a website, megauploaded ignored this and CONTINUED TO HOST THE ILLEGAL CONTENT THEREBY GIVING UP THEIR SAFE HARBOUR STATUS AND TAKING ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HOSTED MATERIAL WHICH IS WHAT THIS COURT CASE IS ALL ABOUT</p>

<p>and if mediafire chooses to ignore the dmca takedown notice and doesn’t remove the copyrighted material they too will lose their safe harbour status and could have the exact same thing happen</p>

<p>A good read, although the license plates on their vehicles deals little to the case. My friend (employed as a computer ‘fixer’ as he calls it) has 2 vehicle’s plates that in one way or another entail the word ‘hacker’. Doesn’t mean hes doing illegal activities.</p>

<p>I was watching BBC news this morning, first time every watching it, b/c it had news about megaupload and they made it seem like megaupload’s whole purpose was for illegal activity. racketeering… so every file-sharing service is an illegal business is basically what they are saying; money laundering is cancelled out since megaupload isnt an illegal means of income; everything they offer site-wise not file-sharing server-wise is all their own and know other’s work but megaupload’s work, and they have ways to report copyright material which if said material is copyright I’m sure they remove it from their servers.</p>

The civil war was over something else, that was due mostly to slavery.<br>
The worst that could happen is possible have the government fired?<br>
or states could go back to being independent and break from US which would cripple, them then they would have to change it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Well thing is that if US places a law since, we are one of the free nations alot of people wan tto be like us, so they will put laws like ours into their own country.</p>
<p>If that does happen then there would be no worries about anything… Im from the UK and i know that the shitty UK government won’t do anything like this…[/quote]<br>
Well most countries follow what we do, cause they want to be like us.<br>
So i wouldn’t be surprised if this law passed that other countries wouldn’t follow.</p>

</aside>
<p>My friend there is where you are wrong.<br>
The reason sopa is trying to take place is due to the entertainment business.<br>
That is why the US sued them for Copyrighted material cause they had films, that was copyrighted in the US, so the US decided well hey we are going to be greedy and start taking money.<br>
Most of this is due to the sopa bill that is trying to be passed.<br>
Seeing how Megaupload was made in 2006, and the US decided now to sue them?<br>
Sorry to say but im sure US has known about Megaupload for years.<br>
Education has nothing to do with this either.</p>

<p>There’s a phishing/false megaupload going around. As far as anyone knows, it’s not actually megaupload. I wouldn’t trust it, considering the owners of megaupload are actually being shipped to America to be prosecuted.</p>
