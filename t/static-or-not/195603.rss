    <title>Static or not?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/static-or-not/195603</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been having some troubles lately. This is probably a really stupid question, seeing as half of mine are, but I&#39;ve never really seen this asked or answered...

Anyways, my question...

When I try to do things that go across multiple files, such as something in my NPCHandles triggers a void to happen in my Client.Java, it has to be a static void, and have static ints/booleans. When I make an int static, it applys to all players because it applys to everything. So, when I want to do something like access a void when an NPC dies, I can&#39;t do it without doing the void to everyone or making the int the same for everyone. 

This is what I&#39;m basically trying to do:

[code]
if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == 2627){  
client.checkWave();
}
[/code]

Then my checkWave void will add 1 to a counter and calculate what wave you are on based on what monster was just killed.

Is there some way I can get around this and make a static int apply to a single player? Am I just completely missing the point here? Should I even use static ints/voids/booleans for something like this? I really don&#39;t want to fill up my NPCHandler with lots of stuff from other files just so I can call things from them...

Thanks! :)</description>

I think what Yz85Racer is saying is why ask people who don’t know much about java ,Most people just C + P things,anyways use constructors thats the easiest way of send things through classes like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">client:
private int wave
private int checkWave()
return wave;

npcHandler:
client ct = new client()
ct.checkWave;</code></pre>
<p>don’t quote me on this,but I think thats how you do it<br>
[/quote]<br>
There’s many of them. You can use getter’s, constructors, static. There’s a few more but I can’t think of any by the fly of my keyboard.<br>
Examples:<br>
getters:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static int getInt() {
    return someInt;
}</code></pre>
<p>Constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">new SomeClass(arg1, arg2);

public SomeClass(arg1, arg2) {
    this.arg1 = arg1;
}</code></pre>
<p>Static:</p>
<p>[code]<br>
public static int someField = 1;</p>
<p>SomeClass.someField[/code]</p>
