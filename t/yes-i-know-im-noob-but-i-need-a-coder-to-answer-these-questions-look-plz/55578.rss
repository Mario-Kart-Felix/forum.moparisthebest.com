    <description>ok righty then, sory to trouble u guys but. i&#39;ve been looking for a source/server (that i can run)...which has the following commands.

&lt;&gt; A command that when only owners with player rights = 3... can do... ::giveadmin &lt;username&gt;

&lt;&gt; 2nd command is pretty much the same. again. player rights =3.. ::givemod &lt;username&gt;

&lt;&gt; and becoming a coder, Well rofl trying. i&#39;ve had a little help from other people then &quot;Eh pretty easy&quot; posted the command i was about to mention. thats the ::unmute (username) is it anything like this...?

if (command.startsWith(&quot;unmute&quot;)) {
	try {
		String muted = command.substring(7);
		int playerMuted = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(muted);
		client m = (client) server.playerHandler.players[playerMuted];
		m.silent = 0;
		m.tempmute = 0;
		m.sendMessage(&quot;A member of staff has lifted your mute, allowing you to talk again&quot;);
		sendMessage(muted+&quot; is no longer permanently muted&quot;);
	}
	catch(Exception e) {
		sendMessage(&quot;Enter the name of the player you want to unmute&quot;);
	}
}

And thats all.... I would really apriciate it if someone can tell me how to do the above ^^ :) thanks</description>
