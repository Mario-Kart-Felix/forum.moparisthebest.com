    <title>School, why so gay?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/school-why-so-gay/194917</link>
    <description>    In my area of schooling, when snow hits, it hits hard. Every year we go a few extra days at the end of the school year due to snow days. Until recently, nobody had a problem with this. It was normal around here, people didn&#39;t mind it. This year, we have a new principle, a productive man, kind of obsessive and completly full of himself. His idea this year, instead of tacking days on to the end of the school year, is to serve them during the school year. Teachers found this idea quite interesting, until he released his plans and put them into action.

    This year, I had no Spring Break. This year, I&#39;ll be spending on multiple days an hour extra hour to make up for days we&#39;ve missed. This, in my opinion, is absurd. Many students had preplanned vacations for Spring Break, if they went, they lost many days of school work. The extra hour? 6½ hours a day isn&#39;t enough as it is? If it was work, I wouldn&#39;t mind getting some overtime. Even the teachers are appalled by this for even they get tired of spending 6½ hours talking and sitting around; it&#39;s quite boring. I pity the teachers that spend many extra hours after school grading papers and doing things that teachers do.

    I met up with a few of my coaches after school today, they never stay too late unless it&#39;s a practice/game/scrimmage night. Of course, school around in a small town is different, so this might seem odd to some of you to know I spend hours after school with teachers. A lot of the teachers find our new principle to be a bit.. paranoid. His goal is to have the schools scores to be the best in the country(like every school, but he&#39;s issuing detentions/4 hours Friday schooling[after school] to those who do bad on test/aren&#39;t doing all their work), as well as top attendance. Now, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I think he has gone a little bit crazy. 7½ hours of school, I now have 3 1½ hour classes in the morning. 

This man is going to drive us all insane. Something I&#39;m wondering is: Should I take this to the school board?</description>

Yeah the snow in England was quite heavy this year, probably the heaviest I’ve seen where I live. I stayed inside most of the day. Then had a snow fight with people a lot younger then me. Naturally, being the the strong handsome jock type I am; I “whooped” their buttocks.</p>

Hah, you would think so Carson, but I guess not. I talked with our Super Intendant today, he told me it was perfectly legal and he admires our principles enthusiasm in achieving better grades. I hate our super intendant, he steals money for ‘off the record’ trips to places.<br>

My school ends at 3:20 and they can keep us in until 5:00, for detention. So the extra hour, actually is allowed.</p>

              <pre><code>In my area of schooling, when snow hits, it hits hard. Every year we go a few extra days at the end of the school year due to snow days. Until recently, nobody had a problem with this. It was normal around here, people didn't mind it. This year, we have a new principle, a productive man, kind of obsessive and completly full of himself. His idea this year, instead of tacking days on to the end of the school year, is to serve them during the school year. Teachers found this idea quite interesting, until he released his plans and put them into action.

This year, I had no Spring Break. This year, I'll be spending on multiple days an hour extra hour to make up for days we've missed. This, in my opinion, is absurd. Many students had preplanned vacations for Spring Break, if they went, they lost many days of school work. The extra hour? 6½ hours a day isn't enough as it is? If it was work, I wouldn't mind getting some overtime. Even the teachers are appalled by this for even they get tired of spending 6½ hours talking and sitting around; it's quite boring. I pity the teachers that spend many extra hours after school grading papers and doing things that teachers do.

I met up with a few of my coaches after school today, they never stay too late unless it's a practice/game/scrimmage night. Of course, school around in a small town is different, so this might seem odd to some of you to know I spend hours after school with teachers. A lot of the teachers find our new principle to be a bit.. paranoid. His goal is to have the schools scores to be the best in the country(like every school, but he's issuing detentions/4 hours Friday schooling[after school] to those who do bad on test/aren't doing all their work), as well as top attendance. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think he has gone a little bit crazy. 7½ hours of school, I now have 3 1½ hour classes in the morning. 
</code></pre>
<p>This man is going to drive us all insane. Something I’m wondering is: Should I take this to the school board?</p>
