About Project Rainbow:

Project Rainbow is a top-notch 317 private server, packed with custom content to please our players.
We try to bring out content regularly to keep fitting the players needs and desires, and have an active community where players can voices their opinion and ideas. Project Rainbow originally started development in early October, 2010. It was officially released to the public on January 3, 2011 under the ownership of Whackatre and was transferred into the hands of Null Amount sometime September, 2012 when Whackatre decided to focus his efforts on other pursuits as opposed to a RSPS. Null Amount, after realizing he had very little time for a private server, he handed the server down to Meee59 in November of 2013. Somewhere November 2014 the server got in the hands of Ucwords, due to Meee59 not having the time or motivation anymore to keep going with the servers current state.
As of April 2015, The One has taken over the ownership of Project Rainbow, the servers management has been changed and we are looking forward to a bright future.

However, the old owners/developer still remain active on our IRC channels and forums and continue to offer their help when they can. Our server plans still remain the same: give players an environment that they will remember long after they&#39;ve logged off. We actively host events to maintain the bond between players and the staff team.

              <p>Announcement by owner:</p>
<p>Hello Rainbowers,</p>
<p>As some of you know, I have recently decided to reclaim ownership of Project Rainbow. I have a few plans to restore PR, but some will be controversial. I plan on doing a partial economy reset as one of the first steps. Everyone will be allowed to keep an inventory full of items and whatever they have equipped. NOTE: This will NOT affect Ironman accounts, and it will also not affect the players who cannot trade (spawners mostly).</p>
<p>Once that’s over with, I intend to host an awesome event that will span several days, including a temporary miniquest available only for the duration of the event. Many items will be given out.</p>
<p>I will also temporarily reduce the donation prices for the months of February/March to reintroduce more items into the economy.</p>
<p>There will be a massive overhaul of item stats, and there will be stat requirements on many customs. Some customs will require non-combat stats as well to encourage skilling.</p>
<p>In addition to the item overhaul, I will be working on getting NPCs redone. I’ll be giving many monsters and enemies a stronger hit to them, but I’ll also reduce their overall HP. I don’t want a server that’s super easy to “AFK”.</p>
<p>My timeline looks something like this:</p>
<p>Jan 27 (today): Announce the eco reset date of Feb 12<br>
Next two weeks: calculate and plan items and stat requirements<br>
Feb 12: Eco reset day! Everyone gets to keep whatever’s in their inventory and equipped.<br>
Feb 13-14: Big event part I<br>
Feb 15-18: NPC work<br>
Feb 19-21: Big event part II</p>
<p>Donation reward prices will be updated Feb 1.</p>

<p>You don’t know that, it isn’t a fact.</p>
<p>I still believe the server is unique, and fun. Although it may never be what it used to be, it can still be enjoyed by the masses. I see the playerbase reaching atleast 20 (by that I mean 20 active players). And since the server is a Delta, it deserves my respect.</p>

<h2>There will be a lot of people agreeing with you on that.<br>
Although the owners after Whackatra did their best to improve the experience for everyone, besides the new owner ‘The one’ there are two co-owners which regularly are working on improvements for the server. They are currently still working on some planned updates. Project rainbow has always had a fluctuating playercount, although with the new content and improvements we hope to maintain a stable and decent playercount.<br>
It most likely won’t reach 60+ as it used to do back when Whackatra was the owner, yet we would already be glad with a stable 25-40.</h2>
<p>Iron man mode recently introduced to Project Rainbow.<br>
As experienced players wanted a challenge, the Co-owner Jack implented Iron man account limitations.<br>
Iron man information, also the reward for the first three players to win the challenge: <a href="http://prserver.net/smf/index.php?topic=5919.0" rel="nofollow noopener">http://prserver.net/smf/index.php?topic=5919.0</a></p>

<h2>If you would have read the OP completely.<br>
You’d know this version has been around since 2011, there been several owners till this moment.<br>
There’s no way any other server, has all the customs and content we currently have. There are a lot of bad Vestige-x leeches yet that doesn’t make then one of the ‘Project Rainbow’ servers.<br>
We reached the lowest playercount we ever had end 2014, once The One took over we got back to 20+ and still fluctuating.<br>
That’s why we’re re-advertising the actual ‘Project rainbow’, to keep it alive for years to go.</h2>
<p>Latest added content: Pkpzone, after being suggested by players.<br>
Extra: Special keys being used for something to come soon…<br>

<p>That is because it IS Project Rainbow. It’s not a remake of it, it’s the same one that’s been around. It’s under new ownership, myself, and it has had many more updates added to it since I took over, and will continue to have updates.</p>

<p>I’m not gonna play this considering you’re just using project rainbow (As if that hasn’t been around 100 times in the past).<br>
You’re even using like the default logo for it…<br>

<p>About Project Rainbow:</p>
<p>Project Rainbow is a top-notch 317 private server, packed with custom content to please our players.<br>
We try to bring out content regularly to keep fitting the players needs and desires, and have an active community where players can voices their opinion and ideas. Project Rainbow originally started development in early October, 2010. It was officially released to the public on January 3, 2011 under the ownership of Whackatre and was transferred into the hands of Null Amount sometime September, 2012 when Whackatre decided to focus his efforts on other pursuits as opposed to a RSPS. Null Amount, after realizing he had very little time for a private server, he handed the server down to Meee59 in November of 2013. Somewhere November 2014 the server got in the hands of Ucwords, due to Meee59 not having the time or motivation anymore to keep going with the servers current state.<br>
As of April 2015, The One has taken over the ownership of Project Rainbow, the servers management has been changed and we are looking forward to a bright future.</p>
<h2>However, the old owners/developer still remain active on our IRC channels and forums and continue to offer their help when they can. Our server plans still remain the same: give players an environment that they will remember long after they’ve logged off. We actively host events to maintain the bond between players and the staff team.</h2>
