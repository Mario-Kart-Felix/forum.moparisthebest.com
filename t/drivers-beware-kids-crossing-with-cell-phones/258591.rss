    <title>Drivers beware -- kids crossing with cell phones</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters Life!) – Drivers distracted by their own cell phones need to be on the lookout for a new danger -- distracted children crossing streets while talking on their own cell phones.

A team at the University of Alabama at Birmingham reported on Monday that children who talk on cell phones while crossing streets are 43 percent more likely to be hit by a car than when their phones are turned off.

&quot;Cell phones clearly offer convenience and safeguards to families, but they also may pose risk,&quot; said doctoral student Despina Stavrinos, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics.

Stavrinos said in a statement that children who attempt to multitask while talking on a cell phone have &quot;reduced cognitive capacity to devote to potentially dangerous activities such as crossing streets.&quot;

For the study, Stavrinos and colleagues used virtual reality software and three TV screens to simulate traffic at an actual crosswalk in Birmingham, Alabama.

The team studied the reactions of 77 children ages 10 and 11 crossing the simulated road six times without the phone and six times while talking on the phone with a research assistant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

True, but kids 10 and 11 don&#39;t need a cell phone first of all.</description>
