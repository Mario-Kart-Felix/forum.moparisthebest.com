    <description>okay to keep this simple, ive made a server and it works fine at my house using the no-ip adress i made pur3pkz.servegame.com, it also works on the computer downstairs which is connected to the same router, but when i try to upload it to the moparscape server page it says it is offline, and when i ask my friends to try it at their houses it says error connecting to server, i followed the portforwarding guide and the how to create a runescape private server guide the best that i could and it works for me but not for other people.

ive added a few pictures of what is happening with some comments in them please help me if you can!  :) use the links below to see the pictures because i got an error when trying to attach them something about the file name being the same...  ;)
