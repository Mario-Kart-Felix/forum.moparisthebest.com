    <title>Most lame problem ever.. basic command won&#39;t work. [317] Delta</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/most-lame-problem-ever-basic-command-wont-work-317-delta/391824</link>
    <description>Hello, I got this command here...
[code]}
if(command.startsWith(&quot;Skillzone&quot;)){
triggerTele(2345, 3691, 0);
sM(&quot;Welcome to the new skiller zone!&quot;);
}[/code]

All I did was copy the home command, changed the coords and the title, and it won&#39;t work at all... all other commands BUT this one work, I put that command RIGHT under the home, it compiled fine and I run the server fine, but when I do ::skillzone, nothing happens at all. I&#39;ve tried so many alternative ways of teleporting and nothing works. I got no idea what this could be at ALL.

EDIT: OK so I tried something like &quot;triplex&quot; which works, but when I try changing it to anything like, &quot;skillz&quot; or &quot;skillazone&quot; nothing it won&#39;t work at all. I have no oter skill command in my server that could interfere either...</description>

<p>this gets rid of needing to make your commands case sensitive and is the right way of doing it anyways.</p>
<p>edit: just realized death basically already said this but it really should be emphasized.</p>

<p>The only thing I notice just by looking at it is that the ‘S’ in skillzone is capitalized, so it wouldn’t work unless you typed ::Skillzone.</p>
<p>Also, since this command doesn’t have any arguments you should use <span class="bbcode-i">equalsIgnoreCase</span> instead of <span class="bbcode-i">startsWith</span>.</p>

<p>Maybe because you put a capital ‘S’.</p>
