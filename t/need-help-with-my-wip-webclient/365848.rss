    <title>Need help with my wip webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-wip-webclient/365848</link>
    <description>ok, so i followed over 4 different webclient tuts, heres how they all turned out:
1) got stuck on the sprites
2) got suck on uploading cache/jar files
3) got stuck on the html part
4) retrying in (x) seconds

now most of the tuts, i couldnt get passed the 3rd problem,
i got past it this time though, because i basically used 3 tuts, (2 on moparscape, one on google.org)
now all of these had generic steps one after another, but had different information on each, so i summarized each of the steps in the tutorial to get past my problems, but im stuck on my 4th problem this time, before i signed/jarred my client, uploaded it and went to the html part, i decided to just test it out before uploading everything, now i already uploaded my cache, set up the downloader so i started up the soon to be webclient, it downloads the cache to the right directory, but after it downloads, it just says connection error,  i decided to go to my c drive and check to see if the file actually downloaded, and it did, clicked on it, the cache and the other files were all tidy and waiting inside, but only to be confronted with the cache.zip to be 0kb. thats as much info as i can give, anyways, can soemone help me with my connection error?</description>
