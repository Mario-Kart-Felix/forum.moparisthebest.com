    <title>Xbox360 dvd drive problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xbox360-dvd-drive-problem/423082</link>
    <description>Before saying &#39;search google&#39; or &#39;l2google&#39; I have been doing this all day and had no luck [b]yet[/b] so I am turning to this community to give me a few suggestions that may have worked for them.

My xbox has been sitting for a few months while I was waiting for a new game to come out (BF3). I bought it yesterday, when I got home I plugged in my xbox to find out the power cord had went bad. I went to gamestop and got a replacement. I got home too late to really do anything so I waiting until this morning. I plugged it in, sure enough the Xbox turns on without a problem. I connect it to the internet, let it update etc. When it&#39;s all done I put in the BF3 single campaign disc and all I get is &#39;Open Tray&#39;, even with some games I had been playing before I let it sit.

I have taken the Xbox apart (there is no warranty anymore, so stuff it) and I think the optical laser is bad. When I first turn on the xbox it does nothing at all, but when I open and close the CD drive it will blink once, before the disc even starts to spin. Could this be a firmware issue or shall I keep searching the internet for a solution.

<p>Alright, I guess that’s my last option. Thanks. Only bad part, I hear that I will need to swap the new drives board with the new one. Is that true?</p>

Lol no, they wont. At least not any usable help.<br>
1&gt; I called gamestop to see if they carried any drives that I could just swap the boards and plug in. No<br>
2&gt; Bestbuy is not a console service center, my uncle called them this morning and got exactly what I was telling him. They don’t service the Xbox360</p>

<p>It doesn’t read it at all. I am wondering if flashing a custom firmware onto the cd drive will fix it.</p>
