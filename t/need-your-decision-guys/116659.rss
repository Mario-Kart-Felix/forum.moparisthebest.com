    <description>[size=20pt]DONT BE SELFISH AND REPLY PLEASE!!![/size]

Ok for my next server update i will be making a bonus crystal system (yes i know how far to busy making extra stuff then finishing the basic stuff) but i love coding stuff that has never been done before.

Now that i finished my special dropping system that allows me to make the monster drops just like runescape i came to an idea when playing eudemons online...

when u kill a monster rarely a glow shows up when u step into this glow it will raise a special amount of gold or exp or dodging


Now i was thinking if i could make such a thing in runescape so i checked it out and yes :D my new dropping system allowed it :)

So now my question is what item shall i use (info is listed below picture) :

[img]http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/9683/crystalsiv4.png[/img]

Blue outlined : an orange Gem that can be activated (activasion will start a random effect)

Green : crystal heart when u use the heart by looking at it it will shatter and activate a random effect

Red : 4 Big crystals every collor holds is own effect gets activated by dropping

Purple : A gravestone activates when dropped will shatter onto the ground into dust then activates random effect


Effects are :

Beserker mode (red glow around u,attackx2 critical hit will hit every monster of 5 steps away)

Gold mode (gold dropped by monsters x2)

Exp mode (exp gained incombat will be x2)

Heal mode (heal 1-3 hp every 5 seconds)

SUGGEST YOUR IDEA EFFECTS !!!

<p>i like the idea of having each color have its own effect</p>
<p>another interesting idea would be if you had to collect the heart pieces then use them on eachother to make the heart then the completed heart would activate the random effect =o</p>
