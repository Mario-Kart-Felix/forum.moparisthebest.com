    <description>Woot woot aced the test anyway got an Excellence!!! (Equivalent to an A)


hey guys i was wondering if anyone could refer me or help me answer some of these questions

For school we have to write about peoples perspectives on the battle of dien bien phu.

the year is mid 1955year after the battle

we have to answer on these question for each of the people below:

1. explain how you felt in the days before the battle begain

2.what action did you take during the battle, and why?

3. How do you feel about the battle now a year latter on?

The people we have to answer the questions on are:

an assistant to giap

an assistant to de Castries

an American adviser to the french

we have to answer each of the 3 question for each person.

If someone could please help me find some good websites on perspectives or just give me a brief summary i would be very greatful
also i have tried researching but i am unable to find anything  :(

thanks for reading this</description>
