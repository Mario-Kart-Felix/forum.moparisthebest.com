    <title>What should I do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-should-i-do/149209</link>
    <description>Well, I have a serious problem on my hands, and I suppose I should tell the story.

Today I went to school and was hanging out with my friends until one of my friends (We&#39;ll call him Bob) came over and was acting strangely. He seemed really depressed and didn&#39;t even bother to kiss his girlfriend who he normally makes out with for the longest time ever. She asked him what was wrong and he said nothing but I noticed he kept on touching the sweatband he was wearing on his left hand (he never wears sweat bands). I suppose she noticed too because she asked him what he was hiding and again, he said nothing. So she ripped it off and we all saw that he&#39;d been cutting himself. He went into a complex story about his mom and how he misses his dad (he&#39;s in Iraq, GBA) so we said that we would talk to him later. My friend (I&#39;ll name him Billy) had a long talk to him at lunch (they have it 5th period and I have it 6th) but I don&#39;t thing he was paying attention. As I was going to 8th period I bumped into him and I saw that he drew a whole bunch of symbols on his arms and he engraved a swastika (The original good swastika, read about it here http://www.jrbooksonline.com/HTML-docs/The_Backwards_Swastika.htm) on his belt. I asked him what the fuck was going on and he was going on about how fucked up his life is. He then showed me 3 symbols that he carved into his legs supposedly standing for protection from fire, protection from water, and the symbol for good luck/love.

So heres my problem, I&#39;m having my friends bring him to the football game tonight and were going to talk to him, but I need to figure out what to say, does anyone have any clues?</description>

Tell him to quit being a pussy, if he’s going to off himself, he should go ahead and do it. No one loves him. He needs to quit being such a burden, he’ll never see his father again. His girlfriend cheats on him with you. He was raped as a very small child by his uncle Paul, and the incident was so traumatizing he suppressed it in his memory. His mom is plaining to off herself one day while he’s at a FootBall game.</p>
<p>That should take care of things… I think. Of course, I could be wrong.<br>

              <p>No, I was trying to make a point. You shouldn’t be asking for help here, you should say what comes to your heart, and if you need further help, ask a counselor to help you with him. No one here is qualified for that kind of situation, no matter what anyone says here. If you need some tips, I suggest you talk to him about his father, and how wonderful his father is. And also  tell him to confront his mother with the issues he has with her.</p>

              <p>Well, I have a serious problem on my hands, and I suppose I should tell the story.</p>
<p>Today I went to school and was hanging out with my friends until one of my friends (We’ll call him Bob) came over and was acting strangely. He seemed really depressed and didn’t even bother to kiss his girlfriend who he normally makes out with for the longest time ever. She asked him what was wrong and he said nothing but I noticed he kept on touching the sweatband he was wearing on his left hand (he never wears sweat bands). I suppose she noticed too because she asked him what he was hiding and again, he said nothing. So she ripped it off and we all saw that he’d been cutting himself. He went into a complex story about his mom and how he misses his dad (he’s in Iraq, GBA) so we said that we would talk to him later. My friend (I’ll name him Billy) had a long talk to him at lunch (they have it 5th period and I have it 6th) but I don’t thing he was paying attention. As I was going to 8th period I bumped into him and I saw that he drew a whole bunch of symbols on his arms and he engraved a swastika (The original good swastika, read about it here <a href="http://www.jrbooksonline.com/HTML-docs/The_Backwards_Swastika.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.jrbooksonline.com/HTML-docs/The_Backwards_Swastika.htm</a>) on his belt. I asked him what the fuck was going on and he was going on about how fucked up his life is. He then showed me 3 symbols that he carved into his legs supposedly standing for protection from fire, protection from water, and the symbol for good luck/love.</p>
<p>So heres my problem, I’m having my friends bring him to the football game tonight and were going to talk to him, but I need to figure out what to say, does anyone have any clues?</p>
