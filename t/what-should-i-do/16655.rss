    <title>What should i do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-should-i-do/16655</link>
    <description>I am the only one that been commited to destorying scamming with any means possible.

But I am now destroyed.  

Genodemon is advising that i give up.  I lack the funding to fight him.  Few here understand raw&#39;s history it seems.  Your all new to cheating.  Unfornantly so am i and now i am learning that my positions will lead to my death.


I mean like all you &quot;higher-ups&quot; roll over at the sight of money.

1. E-fak taking dontations from raw.
2. Even your loved Kaitneiks was probably bought out sadly that is the only conclusion for him re-directing to raw.
3. Mebe you forget kait sold autorune and it got in the hands of a raw(APD at the time).

Do you forget all the scamming that happened before raw got ar?
After, the keylogging and canclled auths that happened when ar was around.  The ar auth process sent the user, pass of the rs char and your ar auth!
Then the 2 years of ar2 &quot;coming&quot; multiple pre-auths sales?

Hes back 180 days after the last scam, the time set by paypal so he can now scam again!</description>

              <p>[quote=“ruler, post:46, topic:16655”]Kaitnieks always passed down things to RaW.  Either it be his community or his bots. Many ppl suspect things but most are scard to voice bc of kaitnieks rep.</p>
<p>eFak josh in <span class="hashtag">#sales</span> on DaNET:<br>
+Joshy          : Raw is paying kaitnieks evo cow and sean all to make AR2<br>
+Joshy          : I kid you not<br>
+Joshy          : Ive been in convos</p>
<p>RaW is friends with all the old higher ups.  They respect each other.[/quote]</p>
<p>If they are working together on an ‘AR2’ it would prove at least 1 of the following points:</p>
<p>[ul][li]1. They have so much time but so little understanding that they could dedicate the effort necessary to such a painful project.[/li]<br>
[li]2. They do not understand precisely what is required to build a system based on the same concept of packet manipulation that AR was based upon.[/li]<br>
[li]3. They enjoy failing in different ways.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>All attempts at humor aside, if they are working on some form of autorune, I would have to assume that they either have some revolutionary way of knowing the packet protocol when an update comes or they are planning on building an effective bot system using bytecode manipulation.</p>
<p>I would admire and pity them if they were trying to go the same route as autorune. I would admire their audacity, I would pity their complete idiocy. Following through with such a project would be possible… only insomuch as it is possible to dig a canal with a plastic spoon.</p>

mopar the admins of the community before you were corrupt but to different degrees.  everyone has a price.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Before DoS warz became the cool way of dealing with rival communities, scams were the standard. Eveyone did it - cracking admin accounts, stealing characters, releasing keylogged bots, registering 10k accounts with a forumfucker script…you must understand how immature everyone was when RSC cheating hit its last boom (with version 201).</p>
<p>In the case of Josh: if you were in with TARC, you were safe and probably got stuff for free (if you were really top-level - like Alex, whose forum name I can’t remember). Anyone else got fucked regularly.<br>
e.g., “Oh, I’m sorry, the database dropped the accounts table…again…but mysteriously preserved the free permanent accounts that I give out to friends.”</p>
<p>As far as why people trusted him, I think it was mostly the AutoRune “brand” that they trusted. Kaitnieks is a trustworthy person, so logically why would he pass on AutoRune to a scammer? Then AutoRune also had this reputation as an uberbot, and maybe it did deserve it (I’ve never seen a java bot do a decent trade slave script like Kaitnieks did), but honestly by 201 you could C&amp;P a java bot that would do pretty much everything - scriptability being the holy grail feature that no one would teach.[/quote]</p>
<p>I dont think Kait sold it directly to RAW. He sold it to someone else whom he didnt think was a scammer, then he in turn sold it to raw. I read it on Kait’s site :).</p>

<p>I don’t believe that convo, perhaps RaW told Joshy that, but why would evo, cow, and kaitnieks come back to just program a bot for RaW? they are all long gone, especially evo.</p>

<p>Before DoS warz became the cool way of dealing with rival communities, scams were the standard. Eveyone did it - cracking admin accounts, stealing characters, releasing keylogged bots, registering 10k accounts with a forumfucker script…you must understand how immature everyone was when RSC cheating hit its last boom (with version 201).</p>
<p>In the case of Josh: if you were in with TARC, you were safe and probably got stuff for free (if you were really top-level - like Alex, whose forum name I can’t remember). Anyone else got fucked regularly.<br>
e.g., “Oh, I’m sorry, the database dropped the accounts table…again…but mysteriously preserved the free permanent accounts that I give out to friends.”</p>
<p>As far as why people trusted him, I think it was mostly the AutoRune “brand” that they trusted. Kaitnieks is a trustworthy person, so logically why would he pass on AutoRune to a scammer? Then AutoRune also had this reputation as an uberbot, and maybe it did deserve it (I’ve never seen a java bot do a decent trade slave script like Kaitnieks did), but honestly by 201 you could C&amp;P a java bot that would do pretty much everything - scriptability being the holy grail feature that no one would teach.</p>

<p>Even if you could take legal action against him, he will not get in any trouble. I don’t know how much he’s stolen over the years, but it’s definately not a large enough number to get him any sentence other than having to pay the money back (which is not a problem for him, he has a lot of the green stuff, the fucking rich kid ;)).</p>
<p>Not that I am advocating what he does, but all you can really do is rest comfortably knowing that you will not fall for his con-artistry and that anyone who does will learn from their mistake soon enough.</p>
