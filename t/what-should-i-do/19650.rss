    <title>What should i do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-should-i-do/19650</link>
    <description>Latetly i&#39;m getting bad grades in school and i think i know why.a few years ago my grades were really good but now it&#39;s getting more worse and worse and the reason is that(i think) i spend too much time with &quot;cool people&quot; who never learn and do &quot;cool stuff&quot;.ofcourse if you spend time with those kind of people you realize they spend much more time outside so ofcourse so did i.so i always went hanging out with those people and forgot learning or making my homework and stuff.

now my question is : should i continue spending time with the &quot;cool people&quot; or should i get a few books from the library and study hard and do nothing else then studying in the weekends to get good grades??

or is there another way of getting good grades??</description>

It’s about getting the grades and getting a good job were you are earning your way in life.<br>
Once you are on the way to success make friends in your job etc.<br>
The chance is, people at school you are supposidly friends with, probably won’t even know each other in 3-5 years.<br>
So just crack down at school get better grades. Study harder, and you’re on the way to a better lifestyle.[/quote]</p>
<p>you got a point there but i dont know if i can do that for 4 years<br>
then thats 4 years gone for just studying</p>
<p>i got a question though.so what if you get just the needed grades to pass the schoolyear isn’t that just the same as getting good grades and still passing ?? what’s the difference anyways ? as long as you pass the schoolyear…right??</p>

              <p>yes but there’s still the problem in class.the “cool people” always talk to me and when i say something back the teachers always notice and i’m sure they’ll tell my parents i talk to much in class.i can’t simply ignore those people can’t i?<br>
talking isn’t the only problem i recently started listening music in class and stuff like that and i’m sure if i hang out with the studying people i wouldn’t do such things.</p>
<p>i really have to choose.</p>
<p>and that’s not the only problem.i need to turn the computer on and listen to music no matter what i do even if i study(like now)i need to turn some music on and like usual i quickly get distracted by the computer.i start going on the forums or talk with friends on MSN.</p>
<p>and these are not the only problems…i think i have trouble concentrating at class.i tried to listen to what the teachers tell but after a few minutes i start thinking about other things.</p>
<p>shortly said : i’m having lots of problems and would like some help <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
