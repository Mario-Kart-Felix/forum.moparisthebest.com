    <title>What should I do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-should-i-do/57501</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t stop thinking about this girl... Her name is Emily.

I can&#39;t explain why I like her so much, she&#39;s just awesome.

This feeling I have right now, it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever had this feeling about a girl.

It&#39;s not a &#39;horney&#39; feeling. It kinda feels like I&#39;m somewhat sick, but I&#39;m not.

She does have a boyfriend at the moment. But I believe the only reason she hasn&#39;t broken up with him yet is because she doesn&#39;t want to hurt him (she&#39;s nice that way  :P).

She&#39;s going to be moving soon, meaning she won&#39;t be going to this church anymore (I&#39;m homeschooled, the only place I see her is at church).

I just... Don&#39;t know what to do.

I&#39;m very shy, I hate talking to anyone unless I&#39;ve spent a lot of time with them that day.

Please write,

Mike.</description>

Of course not, you have to talk to her, prove her you’re much better then her boyfriend. It’s not all about looks, it’s about your personality . Trust me, if you’re not one of the good looking guys, you can make that girl fall in love with you.</p>

<li>if she was unhappy with the relationship, or looking for another guy - why is she in that relationship</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking from the outside in on a relationship is one thing, this guy dosent seem to know her at fucking all. I wouldnt be suprised if hes said more to plants than her. I am not having a go at him, I am meerly stating the facts. By all means, be her friend, but do not spend every moment of your day holding out hope. It could happen, sure, that would be great - but you are talking like you are in love with a girl you dont fully know.</p>
<p>And as for trying to steal her - ‘real’ relationships are strong and arent broken by one guy with a hardon for the girl. If anything you are potentially going to make her feel akward around you, and that isnt what you want to do. Maybe your experiance of “Pmg date me plz I r teh cooler dan j00r boyfriend” has been succesful, but think outside of the playground maybe?[/quote]</p>
<p>wow great advice even tho im not in that situation</p>
<blockquote>Pmg date me plz I r teh cooler dan j00r boyfriend</blockquote>

<p>dont do a thing, move on - she has a boyfriend - if she wanted to be with you - she wouldnt be with him. If and when she dumps him, then ask her out. Dont plot, dont scheme, dont try to break them up.<br>

<p>At his age of course looks matter. I’m not pointing any fingers, but if you’re a sweaty greasy nerdy kid, no chick is going to go out with you unless she is also the same(even then, that’s just gross). You don’t have to be a football star to win a girl, but you certainly cannot be a creepy ugly kid.</p>
<p>As for darting right in and asking her out, I think that’s a horrible idea(just my oppinion). For one thing, her boyfriend will kick your ass and really the best way to get a girl to like you is just talk to her a lot and become friends, with more flirting involved. I’m definitly no guru about girls, but I have had 2 girlfriends so I do have a little bit experience.</p>

Of course not, you have to talk to her, prove her you’re much better then her boyfriend. It’s not all about looks, it’s about your personality . Trust me, if you’re not one of the good looking guys, you can make that girl fall in love with you.<br>

<p>Shit, I’m not gana lie, if I liked a girl and she had a boyfriend I’d try my damnedest to break them up. By that I mean I’d plot and scheme (aka can get her off the rebound?)</p>
