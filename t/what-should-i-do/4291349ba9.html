<p>I’ve never claimed to know everything, just that what i’ve said is fairly accurate. Unlike your statements. You come across very young. I’m curious about your age? Putting words into my mouth. Excellent job.</p>
<blockquote>My name is Amy which is in my mopar name, i made this when i put my name in everything. If you don't understand that then you don't understand much.</blockquote>
<p>I’m talking about majority of your posts which i’ve reviewed.</p>
<blockquote>Also, to back up my uneducated opinions is a 50 yearold who studied psychology. He thinks you've no idea what you're talking about (why by the looks of it is correct). Males are usually the ones to go for what they want despite needing it, females usually only go for the things they need.</blockquote>
<p>Then he’s an idiot and terrible at his job. Now go play with your barbies little girl. Perhaps you can trick them into thinking you’re above the age of 18 (maturity-wise anyway) and your opinions actually matter.</p>

<p>Correct. He’s an idiot. What i’ve said is common knowledge.<br>
She would if he proved himself to be genuine and he showed his intentions were honest. Like i’ve said three times above.</p>
<p>Once again, circles. Every post you appear more and more naive. I’ve won this little debate. Your ego just needs to accept it.</p>

<p>You being a teenage girl just makes you clueless. Sorry.<br>
She probably wouldn’t open up emotionally upon first approach, no. She would enjoy talking about herself though, if approached correctly. Which is what we’ve been debating about? You change your argument every second post.</p>

<p>I’m rather experienced with the opposite sex actually. You’re also not the only one who’s spoken to people in these situations? What a poor argument to throw at me. I’ve also coached plenty of guys in these situations. Majority of them have been successful.</p>
<blockquote>For her to open up at all on the first approach wouldn't be possible, she would hardly talk about anything let alone herself. She might giggle a bit if she found their conversation humourous but i'm sure she wouldn't spill her guts about her life.</blockquote>
<p>Like i said above (i’ve repeated this line a thousand times, because you must have selective reading or something), I agree she wouldn’t ‘open up’ immediately on an emotional level. However, she would enjoy talking about herself if the approach is handled correctly.</p>
<p>I swear i just covered that. I’ve stuck to my points throughout this debate. Yet yours have shifted every two seconds. You’re trying to go against my posts just so you don’t seem less intelligent. It’s having the opposite effect.</p>

As have i, in multipul guy situations one even including a girl at one point. All successful.
<blockquote>Like i said above (i've repeated this line a thousand times, because you must have selective reading or something), I agree she wouldn't 'open up' immediately on an emotional level. However, she would enjoy talking about herself if the approach is handled correctly.</blockquote>
I'm saying even if approched correctly she still wouldn't talk about herself, waht aren't you understanding?
<blockquote>I swear i just covered that. I've stuck to my points throughout this debate. Yet yours have shifted every two seconds. You're trying to go against my posts just so you don't seem less intelligent. It's having the opposite effect.</blockquote>
If you assume you've already won this debate why don't you just stop posting? You said you would before but it seems you haven't, also i've only added things to points that were brought up even if they were very little.

<p>Do not do that.  Odds are she has no friends, and if you ask her why she doesn’t talk, you’re asking her why she doesn’t have friends, which would probably make her more depressed.  (Assuming she already is depressed).</p>

<p>Do not do that.  Odds are she has no friends, and if you ask her why she doesn’t talk, you’re asking her why she doesn’t have friends, which would probably make her more depressed.  (Assuming she already is depressed).</p>

<p>Generally people in school/college have atleast one freind. I based my advise from that. If she says she has no freinds then you offer to be her freind… Simples.<br>

        <p>Rather than make a new post I figure I’ll just tag on here? So I met this girl at work like around October. We actually live in the same town. We have each others numbers and text a bit. We’ve made plans to hang out before but they’ve fallen through both times because one of our other friends couldn’t go. I’ve come to like her a lot. Since I’m a junior this year I asked her to go to my prom since she doesn’t go to my school.</p>

I’m rather experienced with the opposite sex actually. You’re also not the only one who’s spoken to people in these situations? What a poor argument to throw at me. I’ve also coached plenty of guys in these situations. Majority of them have been successful.<br>
[/quote]<br>
As have i, in multipul guy situations one even including a girl at one point. All successful.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Like i said above (i’ve repeated this line a thousand times, because you must have selective reading or something), I agree she wouldn’t ‘open up’ immediately on an emotional level. However, she would enjoy talking about herself if the approach is handled correctly.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m saying even if approched correctly she still wouldn’t talk about herself, waht aren’t you understanding?</p>

<p>I swear i just covered that. I’ve stuck to my points throughout this debate. Yet yours have shifted every two seconds. You’re trying to go against my posts just so you don’t seem less intelligent. It’s having the opposite effect.</p>

<p>If you assume you’ve already won this debate why don’t you just stop posting? You said you would before but it seems you haven’t, also i’ve only added things to points that were brought up even if they were very little.[/quote]</p>
<p>You really are a moron. One even including a girl? congrad-u-fucking-lations. I do professional coaching little girl. I’m payed for it. Also, your opinions are wrong. Everything i’ve said has been tested and tried. Proven successful on most occasions.</p>
<p>I did win. Around 4 posts ago. Yet you fail to accept it. It’s my pleasure to drum it into you. Fuckwit.</p>

<p>Firstly, you’ve done a great job in asking her. It’s preferable that you ask questions like that in person so you can gauge her reaction, but that will do. As for the problem of her not bringing it up, that’s an easy fix. Just ask her what the go is. I do have a few suggestions on how you’re handling this girl though:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You need to actually see her a little more. True emotional bonds cannot be established through text. Ask to catch lunch. Moving in bed at yours is even better. You always always get your dick wet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can’t rely on text. There’s a few reasons. The first is that you can’t see how she reacts to certain things said. Body language reveals more than a bunch of words. I was always told to judge a girl by her actions, not her words. It’s helped me out a fair bit. Also, by hiding behind text you gain false confidence. Sure it’s easier to hide behind a phone, but it’s never going to improve your game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the most important one. Families usually encourage the idea of relationships a little too much. They’re very old-school when it comes to dating. Ignore them. Most of all, ignore mum. If most people did the opposite of how much explained to get girls, then they would get girls haha! Don’t push a relationship. Especially when you barely hangout and haven’t had your prom yet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy every interaction for what it is. Don’t bring it up, yet still show interest. If you push, she will pull back. If you’re really cool about it and patient, then she will leap at the opportunity after time. Our brains make it a bit difficult. We’re hardwired to protect what we see as valuable. Fight the urge.</p>
<p>Hope i’ve been some help.</p>
