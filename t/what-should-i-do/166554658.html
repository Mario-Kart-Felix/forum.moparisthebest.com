        <p>I don’t think Kaitnieks could be bought out. I think it’s more likely he just didn’t really notice/care what was going on at that point. If you look at what Kaitnieks has done for the community,  creating an unkillable cheat, teaching us to learn and adapt, etc. it doesn’t really follow that he would be bought out. I know he wouldn’t help scam people knowingly.</p>
<p>But to stay on point, what should you do? You should keep on hacking man, and I mean that in the sense of hacking through the bullshit and getting done what you want to get done. If you create a bot thats worth something, then you don’t need a huge website to promote it, it will promote itself. Good luck.</p>

        <p>Here are some conversations Cyan (a friend of mine, Delphi coder) had with APD/Josh/RaW in the past.  I didn’t ask Cyan for permission to post these, but I don’t think he will mind since he is no longer around the rs cheating scene, and as soon as I see him around I’ll ask him if it’s ok to post them here.</p>
<blockquote>&gt; Hi Josh, please take time and read this message fully, and reply me. Thanks
&gt; for your time.
&gt;
&gt; Since it seems you are very busy all the time, i thought that sending email
&gt; instead of using messenger would be better, or what? I feel stupid to
&gt; disturb you all the time by messaging you =p
&gt;
&gt; Well as soon as possible, if you still know my address, email it to me
&gt; please. You should understand, that by showing me my own address you comfirm
&gt; me that you really are dangerous for me - if i don't see any proof that you
&gt; can fuck me up, don't except me to be affraid of you or give that much
&gt; respect ;) Some people may say that "Josh can fuck up people" but i started
&gt; wondering, how? If you know my address n stuff, then i understand, but how
&gt; otherwise? I cannot see the way - maybe there is, or maybe tere is not.
&gt;
&gt; And another thing, im so confused, you seem like you are angry at me? But
&gt; why? As far as i know i haven't done anything wrong against you? Or is it
&gt; because im working with kimi, or because i realised that you are not going
&gt; to pay/you never tried to pay.. but hey, i want to forget all that arsim
&gt; crap, we don't need to argue. I just want to know the reasons why you are
&gt; angy at me - maybe i can help it - and live my life normally.
&gt;
&gt; I have nothing against you, and i hope, that you don't have nothing against
&gt; me personally - if there is something like that - then just tell me - don't
&gt; hide it from me =E it just feels stupid and confusing, if i don't know any
&gt; reasons why you are mad at me, just telling me "you are fucked.". Feels lame
&gt; =S
&gt;
&gt; If this is all about the bot and kiMi, then its another thing - you know how
&gt; i love programming n stuff, and finally i could get some credit and respect
&gt; because of my skills. No, this bot isn't all about getting cash by auths, we
&gt; decided to keep them low price anyway. I have learned so much more about
&gt; programming, and thats what im going to do as my job, later on, when im
&gt; littlebit older. I don't personally care if you decompile / crack our bot, i
&gt; wont get mad if you do so - whatever is going to happen, people will still
&gt; remember our names as creators of a great RS2 bot, and if you release it's
&gt; source,  people would see my leet code, and maybe make their own bot, or
&gt; learn from it =) I don't even play runescape - the reason why I am still
&gt; here is because i love the people on all these cheating communities, and i
&gt; love programming + helping out people. RuneScape cheating scene is a great
&gt; hobby - however in our case it went a bit too far i guess, and it feels bad,
&gt; because this is just a java game scene =/
&gt;
&gt; I hope we could talk about these things, that would make everything lots of
&gt; more easier. I understand if you want to fuck up kiMi and our bot, as you
&gt; had some negative stuff with kimi, and its hard for me to tell who was right
&gt; on that case, because simply i don't know. But the thing here i don't
&gt; understand, whats up, why are you wanting to fuck up me? well however, i
&gt; won't believe in any of your threats, before you show me some proof of your
&gt; abilities (my address, etc). But hey - peace out man, i really would like to
&gt; make all these things clear, before someone of us does anything stupid =P
&gt;
&gt; yours,
&gt;
&gt; -censored-
&gt;
&gt; *ps. No, im still not trying to piss you off :) And know - im not pissed
&gt; off. Just confused.
&gt; *ps2. And no, im not affraid of you - yet. Ill be, if you show me a reason,
&gt; and the reason isn't just "I'll fuck you up" ;) I have already met people on
&gt; the internet, who told me exactly the same way, well nothing happened. And i
&gt; heard couple of cases where you were seriously "fucking up" people, but they
&gt; never had any problems =/ I don't know about them, but yeah, proof please =)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Okay, i understood =) So it was all about the bot, and kiMi, not about me? Man, please, you should give me at least littlebit respect, i worked couple of weeks( or more? ) for you, and what did i get? Nothing, but you telling me you will screw my real life if i try to release my programs? not fucking fair, ill say.
<p>Well, ill be thinkin if we should release or not, but i still think that we’ll (note, don’t say “you”, it’s both of us :D) release the bot, I have already worked for it, and it is going to be a good bot. Or then we finish the bot, sell the source and get our names rid of it, change the interface, and have someone else releasing it, but okay. If your “fucking up” is going to be something related to where i live, something like, you release my info somewhere, i don’t mind that so much, im leaving abroad anyways, and won’t come back for a long time… but we’ll see, the bot isn’t being released for a while, so no worries about it for now.</p>
<p>Okay, this case is clear then, however it ended kind of unfairly, but here we are again, in the basics of internet usage: 1st Rule: Do NOT trust anyone on internet. Thats the first thing everyone should learn when using internet, and where was my common sense again =/ Well, im not blaming you, you are the smart one, who tricks the dumbass, who goes and trusts over the web.</p>
<p>Well i had an idea today, what if you pay me the freaking 1000$ via WU and i don’t release anything, and don’t give kimi any delphi sources, shut my mouth up and be happy rest of my life, but i think its a bit too late for this kind of things, whatever.</p>
<p>I hope you a good life, mr watkins, maybe we see someday again, or maybe not =p bye then, you were nice as a friend, not so nice as a scammer, but yeah - i guess i have nothing more to say then.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you told me to except reply, so reply then <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>oh yes, and one thing you cuold ansver me, please? its still unclear for me, why AM I on your “people to fuck up” list? i never tried to piss you off, i never made anything wrong against you? isnt it enough you would just fuck the bot up, not me? hmm</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


<p>This is to Kaitnieks:</p>
<blockquote>Okay, thank you.
<p>But I would like to make something more clear here, actually, Josh told me, what he thinks about our bot and what he is going to do for it, its not because of me, it is because of kiMi. I am not trying to annoy him, or treat him, actually, hes the one here who owes me 1000$ for a program source code. (I was stupid, I trusted him too much and gave him the source before getting any cash). I still have all the sources, and I am going to release them for everyone later on if i don’t get any payment from Josh. He just keeps saying that he really paid, but surprise; after 1,5 months(?) i have still nothing… Can I ask, which way did Josh pay you for autorune source? because he tells me that “he don’t know” how to send me cash… we have tried everything from sending cheque via mail to bank transfers… surprise, all of them have “failed”… well. And so far he has told me, he hates kimi because of the Bot 2.00 case, where Josh offered to pay kiMi 500$ for working on Bot 2.00. Well kiMi (he said) never got that cash and released source (before the deal Josh agreed to if kiMi doesn’t recieve the money within a week, he would release it) and Josh thinks that kiMi is lieing, and has the cash… but well <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I have heard that Josh can “fuck up” people, so it’s better to be “calm” with him… since he knows where i live =/</p>

<p>I have a chat log with him about releasing the source of Bot2, I’ll edit this when I manage to dig it up. I assume most people here already know it, but just to make it sure, <span class="bbcode-b">never trust Josh Watkins</span>.</p>

<p>If someone would like to get back to Josh, maybe some good writer (like PaulT) could write a touching story about Josh’s scams and send it to his girlfriend. Maybe we should make a thread where people can submit their experiences with him. I’m not sure if Josh’s girlfirend, Dana I think her name was, cares but you could try…</p>

<p>Thats a pretty good idea if someone could do it in the general section, that way at least everyone who read it would not trust RaW, that may save a few people from being scammed again. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>I don’t see what legal actions you think you can take against raw - he has commited minor fraud, but a lot of us here are guilty of IP theft and probably more anyway, who is going to take a criminals word against a criminal?</p>
<p>Even if you could take legal action against him, he will not get in any trouble. I don’t know how much he’s stolen over the years, but it’s definately not a large enough number to get him any sentence other than having to pay the money back (which is not a problem for him, he has a lot of the green stuff, the fucking rich kid ;)).</p>
<p>Not that I am advocating what he does, but all you can really do is rest comfortably knowing that you will not fall for his con-artistry and that anyone who does will learn from their mistake soon enough.</p>
