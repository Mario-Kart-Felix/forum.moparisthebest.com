        <p>It’s stupid to take advice on this from a female. Not even they know what they want. Just start off small. Say hello with a smile when you walk past her. See how she reacts. She’s never going to respect you unless you show that you have the balls to chat to her. She doesn’t want a wimp. She wants a rock. But this doesn’t mean showing no emotions. Comfort with your vulnerabilities shows confidence.</p>
<p>In every interaction with the opposite sex, maintain who you are. Forget about seeming too clingy, just be honest with what you want out of an interaction. If you want to get to know her, let her know. Of course there are some exceptions. Being overly sexual is a no no. However, you want to have a bit of sexual energy. Make boundaries and stick to them. If a girl disrespects me, i drop her like a bad habit. Sure you miss out on a sexual partner here or there, but you gain a lot better relationships with higher quality girls.</p>
<p>You’re over thinking the dialogue too much. There’s no perfect ‘line’ or ‘script’ that’s going to get you this girl. There’s no way you can predict her reactions. Just go for it. Man the fuck up or you don’t deserve the girl anyway. Use humour. eg. exaggerations, imitations and roleplaying.</p>
<p>If you’re not having fun, what’s the use. If you’re not feeling the building and release of tension, you’re going to get bored. So be happy that you have the nerves. Remember, she’s just as nervous talking to you.</p>
<p>Tease. Test. See how far you can go before you’ve crossed lines. You can always apologise. The regret of inaction sucks more. Females are forgiving.</p>
<p>Lastly, girls love talking about themselves despite what the above posts say. Everyone loves talking about themselves. Even the insecure. Though they think that they aren’t worth it, so it’s extra flattering when a guy takes interest.</p>
<p>So what if she rejects you? There’s a thousand other fish in the sea. If you’re not accepting the idea of abundance, then you will have problems ever sticking to your own values. You will compromise your boundaries. Our will must be stronger than the females, or they walk all over us.</p>
<p>I apologise for the multiple spelling mistakes and terrible structure. I’d usually write much larger posts on topics like this, but my phone is an absolute prick. I’ve posted some nice pieces on relationships. So if you’re curious, have a scroll through.</p>
<p>I wish you the best of luck.</p>

<p>Yer I’m sure a girl doesn’t know what she wants, that makes a lot of sense.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ever seen a girl complain about how much of a jerk someone is, yet they keep returning to them as lovers? Even while saying they want a nice guy?<br>
Ever experienced only wanting something because you can’t have it? Then when you gain it, it loses it’s value and you figure that it’s not what you actually needed? I can promise you that this is a common occurrence for most women. You could always argue that only insecure girls go for jerks. That’s a lie. Even if they did have a slight clue as to what they want (yeah, good luck), it could change within an instant if presented with the right sort of guy. It can be changed and altered depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Not many people know what they want. Society and how we were raised complicates it all. What we admit to. What we’re in denial about. Males are the same.</p>
<blockquote>Also i know a lot of girls who feel insecure to talk about themselfs, mainly the shy ones.</blockquote>
<p>They don’t talk about themselves because they think the boy doesn’t genuinely value what they have to say. If the guy above makes his intentions to know her clear and makes her feel comfortable, she will LOVE talking about herself.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Tree, post:28, topic:429134”]Ever seen a girl complain about how much of a jerk someone is, yet they keep returning to them as lovers? Even while saying they want a nice guy?<br>
Ever experienced only wanting something because you can’t have it? Then when you gain it, it loses it’s value and you figure that it’s not what you actually needed? I can promise you that this is a common occurrence for most women. You could always argue that only insecure girls go for jerks. That’s a lie. Even if they did have a slight clue as to what they want (yeah, good luck), it could change within an instant if presented with the right sort of guy. It can be changed and altered depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Not many people know what they want. Society and how we were raised complicates it all. What we admit to. What we’re in denial about. Males are the same.</p>
<p>They don’t talk about themselves because they think the boy doesn’t genuinely value what they have to say. If the guy above makes his intentions to know her clear and makes her feel comfortable, she will LOVE talking about herself.[/quote]</p>
<p>She would know what she WANTS until she has it but that doesn’t mean she NEEDS it, humans are like that and you can’t say either gender doesn’t. Insecure girls don’t go for jerks because guys will only treat them like jerks, but girls do rely on comments to become more secure and only then is when they’d date the guy. Just the same guys rely on comments in certain areas so they can feel more secure, again it doesn’t just happen with the one gender.</p>
<p>They don’t talk about themselfs in general, even aroudn their friends. They might say how their day went if asked but they will never go ‘can you believe that guy totally dumped me, i mean i’m the best person he ever dated and he dumped me!’. Also, most guys like to talk about themselfs even if it is just a part of themselfs that they enjoy the most… If you know what i mean.</p>
<p>Sure i might not know what this girl wants because i’ve never met hear, but generally speaking to get a girl that doesn’t speak to anyone to speak to you, you basically just have to make her laugh because girls always like a commedian or even just talk about a few things she might know about just to ease her up a bit.</p>

        <blockquote>She would know what she WANTS until she has it but that doesn't mean she NEEDS it, humans are like that and you can't say either gender doesn't.</blockquote>
<p>As i said above, males are sometimes the same when it comes to this. No, because it isn’t actually what she emotionally wants. It’s what she thinks she wants.</p>
<blockquote>Insecure girls don't go for jerks because guys will only treat them like jerks, but girls do rely on comments to become more secure and only then is when they'd date the guy.</blockquote>
<p>Actually, insecure girls tend to drift towards jerks. My point was that not only insecure girls do this though. There was actually a study done on this. If i track it down through my course notes, i’ll inbox it to you. It’s an interesting read.</p>
<blockquote>Just the same guys rely on comments in certain areas so they can feel more secure, again it doesn't just happen with the one gender.</blockquote>
<p>Again, i never claimed for it to only be for one gender.</p>
<blockquote>They don't talk about themselfs in general, even aroudn their friends. They might say how their day went if asked but they will never go 'can you believe that guy totally dumped me, i mean i'm the best person he ever dated and he dumped me!'. Also, most guys like to talk about themselfs even if it is just a part of themselfs that they enjoy the most... If you know what i mean.</blockquote>
<p>Because they feel as though they’re judged by their social group. Society modifies behaviours. Like i said above, they will open up if they’re under the impression the boy genuinely cares. Emotionally connect.</p>
<blockquote>Sure i might not know what this girl wants because i've never met hear, but generally speaking to get a girl that doesn't speak to anyone to speak to you, you basically just have to make her laugh because girls always like a commedian or even just talk about a few things she might know about just to ease her up a bit.</blockquote>
<p>I’ve also mentioned humour in my previous post. It eases the other person into a situation or topic. Adds comfort to the whole thing.</p>

Males are the same, not sometimes. Guy go for what they want, not technicly what they need. They also want something if they don't have it, as you posted above about girls.
<blockquote>Because they feel as though they're judged by their social group. Society modifies behaviours. Like i said above, they will open up if they're under the impression the boy genuinely cares. Emotionally connect.</blockquote>
These people aren't judged and they know they aren't judged, they can be around their best friend and still not mention themself during a deep conversation.
<blockquote>I've also mentioned humour in my previous post. It eases the other person into a situation or topic. Adds comfort to the whole thing.</blockquote>
As did i and yes it does, but in any situation even if the person is just friends with the other.

        <blockquote>Males are the same, not sometimes. Guy go for what they want, not technicly what they need. They also want something if they don't have it, as you posted above about girls.</blockquote>
<p>No. Sometimes is the correct word. If a guy maintains his boundaries, values and dominating willpower… then they become more in-tune with what they actually need. Girls can achieve the same i guess, but this is highly inefficient for them with the gender roles and relationship dynamics. Male dominating female. The males must have stronger willpower. Must be a little dominating. While a female should submit a bit. Take the males protection.</p>
<p>If anything, a female being insecure helps grow a relationship because it makes a males role so much more easier to slip in to.</p>
<blockquote>These people aren't judged and they know they aren't judged, they can be around their best friend and still not mention themself during a deep conversation.</blockquote>
<p>They are judged. Everyone judges. We judge all the time. We’re also wary of other’s judgement. The emotional connection between a male and female however, calms this a little. That’s why if a guy is genuine with his intentions and honest, a female will open up and love talking about herself.</p>
<blockquote>As did i and yes it does, but in any situation even if the person is just friends with the other.</blockquote>
<p>I never said otherwise.</p>

Actually it isn't, if a person in general wants something really bad they'll go for it (doesn't matter abotu their gender). Girls like boys can resist a lot of things just the same, and a lot of the time in relationships males have to give into the females because the girls won't (this is how fights begin).
<p>I don’t think you understand, not ALL girls direct a conversation toward themselfs. Some might but some don’t, you can’t just say all do because you haven’t talked to every girl.</p>
<p>Neither did i.</p>
