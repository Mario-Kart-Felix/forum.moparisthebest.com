    <title>What Should I do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-should-i-do/429134</link>
    <description>Well since MOST of you mscpers are all like over 18 (the more professional ones)
So, here&#39;s the case. I REALLY like this girl, a Crush I liked her since I started highschool and I am a sophomore now
She Is really really quiet, She won&#39;t talk to anybody not girl nor boy
It&#39;s killing Me, Does anyone have suggestions? 
I am not used to public speaking and especially talking to girls.

There aren’t many ‘moparscapers’ over 18; mitbers, yes. I laughed at ‘professional’. Just talk to her like a normal human being, you’re of the same age/location/school or around it so surely you two must have SOME common ground.</p>

<p>PS. While we’re on this topic, I once had a chance at having a relationship with a girl. I messed it up royally though, but now when I look back I realise that she isn’t really the best match for me. What I think is, the emotions I used to feel were just related to this being my first relationship, nothing else.</p>

              <p>fuck her she’s not noticed you yet, i have do me!</p>
<p>But anyways… I used to really like this girl who is also shy and quiet(probably not as quiet as the girl you like), trust me I adored her ;o.<br>
Basically, what I did cause at the time I was in High School and she was in her girlygroup at that time not friends with my friends so I basically as soon as I saw her talking to someone I knew I went over joined in the conversation made her laugh a bit then jokely teased and then I basically became friends with her little group as trust mee girls listen to there friends if your not there number one and if your just getting to know her your not her number one yet. So after that luckily we connected our personalities wise and the kaboomski we was going out:D.<br>
See if she doesn’t really talk to people if somehow just get her talking just that little bit to you  by talking about her interests and showing a keen interest in her(not too keen unless she likes you ofc) then she’ll just latch onto you and it shouldn’t be too hard as long as theres Chemistry between yous however do you really want to go out with a person based on just there looks? Cause if she really is that shy and quiet she might naturally be like that and that might not be a fit for you and remember you shouldn’t have to do all the work, going out with someone is two way feelings if your putting in all the effort she doesn’t deserve you :o.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t work out, i’m always here for chuu &lt;3</p>

<p>[quote=“sp11k3t3ht3rd, post:59, topic:429134”]Rather than make a new post I figure I’ll just tag on here? So I met this girl at work like around October. We actually live in the same town. We have each others numbers and text a bit. We’ve made plans to hang out before but they’ve fallen through both times because one of our other friends couldn’t go. I’ve come to like her a lot. Since I’m a junior this year I asked her to go to my prom since she doesn’t go to my school.</p>

<p>HER:</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Hahahahah its fine, but ill defs check it out!</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s been like a week and we’ve been talking a bit but she hasn’t said anything. Also, like my entire family has told me that I should date her…but I don’t think I have a chance… do any of you?[/quote]</p>
<p>Firstly, you’ve done a great job in asking her. It’s preferable that you ask questions like that in person so you can gauge her reaction, but that will do. As for the problem of her not bringing it up, that’s an easy fix. Just ask her what the go is. I do have a few suggestions on how you’re handling this girl though:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You need to actually see her a little more. True emotional bonds cannot be established through text. Ask to catch lunch. Moving in bed at yours is even better. You always always get your dick wet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can’t rely on text. There’s a few reasons. The first is that you can’t see how she reacts to certain things said. Body language reveals more than a bunch of words. I was always told to judge a girl by her actions, not her words. It’s helped me out a fair bit. Also, by hiding behind text you gain false confidence. Sure it’s easier to hide behind a phone, but it’s never going to improve your game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the most important one. Families usually encourage the idea of relationships a little too much. They’re very old-school when it comes to dating. Ignore them. Most of all, ignore mum. If most people did the opposite of how much explained to get girls, then they would get girls haha! Don’t push a relationship. Especially when you barely hangout and haven’t had your prom yet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy every interaction for what it is. Don’t bring it up, yet still show interest. If you push, she will pull back. If you’re really cool about it and patient, then she will leap at the opportunity after time. Our brains make it a bit difficult. We’re hardwired to protect what we see as valuable. Fight the urge.</p>
<p>Hope i’ve been some help.</p>

              <p>Rather than make a new post I figure I’ll just tag on here? So I met this girl at work like around October. We actually live in the same town. We have each others numbers and text a bit. We’ve made plans to hang out before but they’ve fallen through both times because one of our other friends couldn’t go. I’ve come to like her a lot. Since I’m a junior this year I asked her to go to my prom since she doesn’t go to my school.</p>
<p>ME:</p>
<blockquote>Hey, I know this is kinda lame doing this over txt, but I don't get to see you that much in person. I was wondering if you wanted to go to my prom with me. Obviously you don't have to answer now. My cousin(*also friend from work*) will be in the same limo so you'll have someone to talk to besides me haha</blockquote>
HER:
<blockquote>AW lol mikee that'd be so fun! When is it??</blockquote>
intermittant txts about me being nervous about asking her...
<p>HER:</p>
<blockquote>Hahahahah its fine, but ill defs check it out!</blockquote>
It's been like a week and we've been talking a bit but she hasn't said anything. Also, like my entire family has told me that I should date her..but I don't think I have a chance... do any of you?

As have i, in multipul guy situations one even including a girl at one point. All successful.

I'm saying even if approched correctly she still wouldn't talk about herself, waht aren't you understanding?

If you assume you've already won this debate why don't you just stop posting? You said you would before but it seems you haven't, also i've only added things to points that were brought up even if they were very little.

<p>Like i said above (i’ve repeated this line a thousand times, because you must have selective reading or something), I agree she wouldn’t ‘open up’ immediately on an emotional level. However, she would enjoy talking about herself if the approach is handled correctly.</p>
<p>I swear i just covered that. I’ve stuck to my points throughout this debate. Yet yours have shifted every two seconds. You’re trying to go against my posts just so you don’t seem less intelligent. It’s having the opposite effect.</p>

<p>If you were to talk to him he would rip your theories to shreds, you’re incorrect. You’d think as a teenage girl myself i would know more about this topic then you would considering and she wouldn’t open to a guy that comes and randomly talk to her proving that he is interested, it takes more then a few choice words for a shy girl to open up.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You being a teenage girl just makes you clueless. Sorry.<br>
She probably wouldn’t open up emotionally upon first approach, no. She would enjoy talking about herself though, if approached correctly. Which is what we’ve been debating about? You change your argument every second post.</p>
