    <title>What Should I do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-should-i-do/105755</link>
    <description>Well, I make this topic in question and seeking advice on my future. As you all know, I race a dirt bike. And my goal in life is to be the best at racing a motorcycle. But, school is murdering me. All my teachers hate me. It&#39;s my first year of high school.. And the teachers have something against me, and yes. I do know why. It is because I am a bit naughty in class.

I never was normally, but come year 6, I started being bad in class. And I think I know why...
I started puberty.
And I&#39;m not embarrassed to say that.

But, now I&#39;m hated by all my teachers.. Let me put you into my shoes.

I&#39;m 13, and my teachers hate me, my books are missing because some older kids, like year 12&#39;s or something, thought it would be funny to take my books out of my bag... And hide them... Now, I have no idea where they are. I have no workbooks.. My teachers are getting pissed off with me because of that. I try to tell them and they say something like...
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve just lost them Mr. Richards.&quot;
In a couple of weeks, parent-teacher interviews are coming up. So, I&#39;m worried. I want to drop out of Rugby League, but don&#39;t know how to ask my parents. They were shattered when I asked to drop out of Swimming, and they argued with me. But, Rugby League is a shit of a sport when you play A Grade and have to get up the next morning.

Want me to tell you my routine for the week?



Monday - Motorcycle Training (I&#39;m missing that today)
Tuesday - Rugby League training. (Now, that&#39;s A Grade Rugby League. So imagine how hard the training is)
Wednesday - Motorcycle Training.
Thursday - Rugby League training. Same again, A Grade.
Friday - My only day off.
Saturday - Rugby League. Which bashes me around. I&#39;m against kids that want to play League. I play for fun. Bike preparation, and travel.
Sunday - My Favorite Day Ever. Race day.

I&#39;ve done that routine... For 4 years. You know what I want my routine to be?



Monday - I don&#39;t care. Train for Motocross. Or nothing.
Tuesday - I don&#39;t care. Train for Motocross. Or nothing.
Wednesday - I don&#39;t care. Train for Motocross. Or nothing.
Thursday - Ride at my private track in the bush.
Friday - I don&#39;t care. Train for Motocross. Or nothing.
Saturday - Bike preparation and travel day (If it&#39;s an [b]Open Meeting*[/b]) 
Sunday - Race Day.

At the moment. I&#39;m just sick of life treating me like this. Oh and not to mention. I have like... 3-6 friends at school. That&#39;s all. The teacher wonders why I get up the shit with other kids.
All I want to do in life, is Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride.
So what should I do?
At the moment I&#39;m think of dropping out in year 10, and getting a trade. So if I don&#39;t make it in the professional ranks of Motocross, I can fall back onto a trade.



[b]Open Meeting - an interstate meeting, e.g New South Whales Championship or Australian Championships.[/b]</description>

<p>when you turn 18 your parents are going to start making you pay for ever race you enter and its going to start to get very expensive… It happened to me and it will happen to you. Since dirt biking is still my purpose in life, i suggest you keep up with the racing as much as you can because when your parents cut the funds off, your racing days are over.</p>

              <p>Your routine looks really rough… Imo you should drop other hobbies than motocross, because it will keep you in fit anyways and it’s more exciting! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Instead of Rugby you should study, as Kane and Sila said, you will need good grades from school. I’m not saying that you can’t live with motocross, but you shouldn’t count on it.</p>
<p>Do what you like best, don’t listen to your parents - It’s your decision, afterall, they can’t force you to play rugby if you don’t want to, can they?</p>
<p>Study hard but also keep training motocross.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, she’s right.<br>
Without good grades in school you really have nothing to fall back on if the racing doesn’t work out. (Nothing that pays good, anyway.)</p>
<p>Sounds stressful.<br>
Just drop it.</p>
<p>It’s your life, not your parents.</p>

Tell you parents that rugby isn’t for you and tell them that you’d do better in school if you quit the league and focused only on motorcross and school.</p>
