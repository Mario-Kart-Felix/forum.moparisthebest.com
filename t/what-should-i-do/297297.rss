    <title>What should i do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-should-i-do/297297</link>
    <description>For the past month i have been looking for the &#39;perfect&#39; source that fits my needs and everyone else likes. But i haven&#39;t found any. When i look at a server status page such as www.codefasga.com/status or the moparscape one. Out of one hundred servers there are 85 delta and 15 czar based ones. I have tried running a czar and the most i could have gotten was nearly 8 people, I even advertised and made youtube videos and put it on every server status page. I tried running a delta server which is the most common now a days and i couldn&#39;t even get 4 people to stay logged on even when i give them all admin. I only do 317&#39;s and i only host servers compatible with silab and moparscape webclient. What do you suggest i should do? What servers do people play? What server base should i use? How do i get 30+ players on this server you suggest to me? Please help me it would be greatly appreciated.</description>
