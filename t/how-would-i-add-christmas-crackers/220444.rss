    <title>How would I add Christmas Crackers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-add-christmas-crackers/220444</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i&#39;m working on making some random events, and I want one to give you a random item, and one is a christmas cracker, (I have all that down so far)
But how would I make it so if you use the christmas cracker on a PLAYER it would give you a random item, I know I would have to put like if the item is used on a player blah blah blah and additem.RandomCracker and stuff,  But what would I use to make you able to use it on a player?
Thanks in advance ;)</description>
