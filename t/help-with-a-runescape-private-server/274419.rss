    <title>Help with a runescape private server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-a-runescape-private-server/274419</link>
    <description>you know how http://runescape.com/ is programed and everything. it is also set up like I wanted it to look like on my site. I have it set up on my site but the thing is, I don&#39;t have the client. this is making me mad and I want to know where I go to get the javascript codes to make the clients work for other people to use my private server. I do not want to download and install it on my computer because I do not have enough space to do shit on this computer. I want to know if someone knows any website to download the client for people to play the game on my server and get free donator days on there to play the whole game and not pay a cent on anything.

I&#39;ve been looking on google and everything but I can&#39;t find anything. my site where I put this stuff is on http://gambino-army.co.cc/runescape/ can you please help me on this?

I will give you a lot of items on there so you can play this game faster. this will be fun too.</description>

              <p>someone needs to help me at trying to get a client. I see that there are lots of downloads on modifications of runescape but the thing is, there are no pages set up for the websites. there are no proper web pages, nor is there any batabases that I can put into a server for people to play online just like runescape. where do I get the codes and stuff to set up this web page?</p>
<p>I really want to set this up for everyone I know and other people to play with. I would really want to mod this game so people will like this game better than it looks on runescape.</p>

              <p>that’s not getting help on getting a private server client of runescape. I didn’t say I wanted a private server for WoW. I already have it. I just need to wait for the new patch to come out with the private server so my friends and I can play online again. I want to know where to get the javascript clients so I can set up <a href="http://gambino-army.ej.am/runescape/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://gambino-army.ej.am/runescape/</a> let me know at this email because I will not be able to respond much without someone emailing me at <a href="mailto:mr_gambino_2@yahoo.com">mr_gambino_2@yahoo.com</a>.</p>
<p>please, I beg of you. I need a client for runescape. send any codes that will work on websites.</p>
