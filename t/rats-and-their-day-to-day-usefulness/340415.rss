    <title>RAT&#39;s and their day to day usefulness</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rats-and-their-day-to-day-usefulness/340415</link>
    <description>First off, If you do not know what a RAT is it is a remote administrative tool. I did not see any rules about &quot;hack&quot;/&quot;virus&quot; discussion so I did not see any reason not to post this.

On to the topic. Recently just finishing my Freshmen Year of college, about a month before finals I managed to get a RAT disguised as a hitter file from a C++ program onto my Professors computer. Blah Blah Blah, to the point, It gave me full access to his computer when i knew he was out of the room. Gave me access to the final and turned out pretty excellent. Anyone else with fun success stories?

Also in an early defense, One don&#39;t call me a script kiddie right off the back. And two Yes I do know what I am doing. :-D

EDIT: If a staff believes this would be better suited in programming general or else where, please move it.</description>

              <p>[quote=“xxxxxx 13, post:1, topic:340415”]First off, If you do not know what a RAT is it is a remote administrative tool. I did not see any rules about “hack”/“virus” discussion so I did not see any reason not to post this.</p>
<p>On to the topic. Recently just finishing my Freshmen Year of college, about a month before finals I managed to get a RAT disguised as a hitter file from a C++ program onto my Professors computer. Blah Blah Blah, to the point, It gave me full access to his computer when i knew he was out of the room. Gave me access to the final and turned out pretty excellent. Anyone else with fun success stories?</p>
<p>Also in an early defense, One don’t call me a script kiddie right off the back. And two Yes I do know what I am doing. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>EDIT: If a staff believes this would be better suited in programming general or else where, please move it.[/quote]Damn those hitter files!</p>

<p>Funny thing was about half an hour after he’d put it on his memory stick he some how managed to lose the memory stick, we knew it was in one of the bins so we had to beg the school cleaners to let us go through the bags of rubbish, luckily we found it at the bottom of a stinky bin bag. We worked for that god damn paper.</p>
