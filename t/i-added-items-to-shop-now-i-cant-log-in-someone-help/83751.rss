    <description>I added some barrows items in-place of capes in a ship in pimpscape source on my server. But, now when I try to log in, it just stays at a black screen. I dont know how to post pics honestly, so I can&#39;t tell ya much. Can someone send me their shops.cfg file please? 
It would be of great help. :)

OMG, I help people day after day... And then when I post, I can&#39;t get a single reply.</description>
