    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xloging-problem/293882</link>
    <description>well x-logging has become a problem on my server

so i need the fix for x-logging on delta

if anyone knows how to fix, please share



PS: i hear all you gotta do is remove 1 line (idk wat line tho &gt;.&gt;)


EDIT: all my attempts have failed
attempt 1) player never gets logged out and its glitched causing major lag.
attempt 2) player doesn&#39;t even stay on, logged imediatly.</description>
