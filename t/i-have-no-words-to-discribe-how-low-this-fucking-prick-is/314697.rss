What the fuck is wrong with this prick? I&#39;ve seen the actual video (The one I linked you to is not the real one) and I must say, that I almost cried. I hope a fucking group of people just pick him up and throw him off the same fucking bridge. And If he survives, they pick him up again and throw him.

What the fuck is wrong with people today? I find it so sad that a helpless little animal had to go through this. Thank God the dog is OK though.

Anyway, discuss.</description>

<p>There’s a difference between hunting and killing/murder/abuse. In the beginning, man used to hunt for his food, which was considered their living, which is honestly the only way we are all here today. We’re not here because some prick in the beginning thought it’d be hilarious and drop a dog very high off the ground. Population control? I can understand where you’re coming from with that point, but purposely holding an animal in your arms that you know that you have a huge advantage over and more dominant over and they cannot escape from you because of those points and inflicting pain and harm on it for enjoyment, shits, and giggles? Honestly, what the fuck makes you think you’re better than a dog, or a deer? You’re an animal too, we all are. He wasn’t controlling the population, he was being a huge fucking asshole. What gives man the right to control a population of an animal anyways?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Wait… i thought you were christian… Don’t they believe humans &gt; all and that humans have a soul while no one else does?</p>
<p>And i honestly don’t like how heaven sounds. A place where EVERYONE is happy ALL the time. The reason we reach for happiness is the very reason we feel sadness, if we don’t reach for it since it’s given to us, no one would try. If no one trys it is a boring fuck place where everyone sits there smiling their asses off. Earth is Heaven.</p>
<p>But Seriously, do you think if there was a god he would have proven himself real to the people? don’t you think he would get upset? Oh wait, he’s from Heaven so he’s always happy, my bad. So is he just sitting up there smiling and happy that all these terrorists are killing his creation? It seems so.</p>
<p>Why would there be all this bad stuff in the world if there was a god? Oh yeah we ‘abuse’ what god gives us. And of course, since god is always smiling ear to ear he cbf what we do. Survival of the fittest was a quote from a wise man, and i hate wise men. Their wisdom is based upon several lies they preach to be correct. Everything is a lie, ever think of that? The truth is what we make ourselves believe true for the sake of happiness.</p>
<p>I do believe there is a god to be honest, but not a heaven or any of that shit. A quote from a greek god (Don’t know his name), “If life isn’t fair, why should death be?” . I believe that everyone has their story wrong. Jesus might have been real, but back to truth and it being a lie.</p>
<p>Life is like a book, you can’t help but just watch the pages flip and the story unravel, all you can do is enjoy the ride. 2009 years after jesus, we have found little to none proof that god exists, he is just the ‘truth’, a utter grasp for hope, a reason to be happy and live on. I am happy and proud for religion and look forward for the future of my book.[/quote]</p>

<p>There’s a difference between hunting and killing/murder/abuse. In the beginning, man used to hunt for his food, which was considered their living, which is honestly the only way we are all here today. We’re not here because some prick in the beginning thought it’d be hilarious and drop a dog very high off the ground. Population control? I can understand where you’re coming from with that point, but purposely holding an animal in your arms that you know that you have a huge advantage over and more dominant over and they cannot escape from you because of those points and inflicting pain and harm on it for enjoyment, shits, and giggles? Honestly, what the fuck makes you think you’re better than a dog, or a deer? You’re an animal too, we all are. He wasn’t controlling the population, he was being a huge fucking asshole. What gives man the right to control a population of an animal anyways?</p>
