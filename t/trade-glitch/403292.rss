    <title>Trade Glitch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trade-glitch/403292</link>
    <description>Ok well im hosting a [PI] base hybridpvp source and a player went into the &quot;P&quot; and found a hybridpvp link that i cannot get rid of, they went to this site and found bug reporting forums and found a trade glitch. This trade glitch is when you trade somebody and say you give them 100m, you both accept the first screen and on the second screen they accept first then when you accept instantly after that you click on the mini map and it dupes the cash. So what I would like to know is how to fix this glitch, also how to get rid of the link on the &quot;P&quot; tab. If you dont know how to fix it could you atleast tell me how to turn off ALL trading not just for staff so it is atleast stopped in the mean time until i find a new source or fix this problem.</description>
