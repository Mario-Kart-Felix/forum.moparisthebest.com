    <title>How to fix pots!!! @!@!&quot;@!¬&quot;@!&quot;@!&quot;@!&quot;@!@&quot;!@&quot;@!¬&quot;@!¬@&quot;!¬@&quot;@!¬@&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-fix-pots/67700</link>
    <description>I was thinking about in the real rs, its set up so you can use pot (2) with pot(3)
and you would get pot(4) pot(1) back. Can any body help me make this? 
riting them out agen and agen for each pot would take up a lot of room and time.

if anybody could rite this up for me and the rest of the private world that would be grate,
or telling me how i wouldnt mind doing it at all.</description>
