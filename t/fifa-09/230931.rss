    <title>Fifa 09</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fifa-09/230931</link>
    <description>This demo was released and frankly i think its amazing i know some of you guys(Greeny) hate sport games but i do think this is good fun, the controls are easy to use and even if you hate them you can change now so its easier thann ever before to get involved in fifa. The new trick stick system is a big improvement over the previous one in &#39;08 it feels lighter, swifter and more managable before you had to throw the stick around to get the right trick now the controls are intuitive and easy to get to grips with. T
he graphics are amazing you can look at them and think wow that looks like the real player, the big picture of ronaldhino when you load the demo doesnt look like him imo but apart from that :D when you score you can celebrate with a variety of different animations its a nice touch. Custom tactics arent featured that much in the demo theres a taster but im sure when the full version is released it will rock. Penalties have been greatly improve because before you, as a keeper, could cover any third of the goal with ease and it was just about guessing which way they would shoot. Now though, you do actually have to dive and have quick thinking on your side. 
Passing is more realistic, you can pass to one guy but with extra power you can pass to him just ahead of his current position kinda mid-way between a through ball and a pass. The arena goalkeeper is alot more accomplished than the previous guy which is nice to see. Also when you load up a match(offline) it has the two teams on a bar at the top and it runs through the tactics of the team and compares them then it counts down to 0 and the arena is replaced with the stadium you will be playing in and the keeper with the actual keeper. So you have the arena benfits in the stadium until you press start. This will be cool in wembley :D. 
One thing they havent included that i wished they had, was the ability to have an NPC or a second player in the arena, this way you can practice crosses, passes etc in the arena making it a bit more worthwhile. I do hope there is a way to include the little power bar above the players head in match like in the arena because thats very helpful. 
The addidas live season is the feature i am most looknig forward to(even though watford wont be included :&#39;( ) because teams will play like the real life counterparts, this way its not down to the pure abilities of the player theres an element of unpredictability thrown in there. Ronaldhino is now no longer the best player in the game( like the update in 08 fixed ) since his poor form last season even though he is now at milan. Maybe this will change when the new update after the Jan transfer season is finished i dont know but we will see</description>
