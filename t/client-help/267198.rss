    <description>Welcome, Ok I have a server and I custom code stuff. But I want to know If there is a way where I can just use the client for people to run and I can also use just to log on. I want the server files still My server files are &quot;Reapagescape v1&quot; So I usally run my server from there. So do I need to start my code over on a Client? 

Also I need some help with a client. I need a good base and I also need to know where I can change it to make it automatically go to my server IP. If you can please help me. 

Mostly:

1.Need to know If i can still keep server files to compile the &quot;Server&quot;
2.Need a client for people to use to connect to the &quot;Server&quot;
3.If you can help me thanks if not its ok. :)</description>
