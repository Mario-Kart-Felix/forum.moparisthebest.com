              <p>:l      Archiving a file is supposed to make it smaller. A rar file, like a zip file, is basically like a piggy bank. You can stuff it with files but if you want to use those files, you have to break the piggy bank as in extract the files in order for them to work. From what your saying, it sounds like your players are not extracting the files from the rar file but are trying to run then inside of it.</p>
