http://uppit.com/3i626zab5k5j/client_and_cache.rar



In client.java i made new downloading cache file and this is it
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/95700454/cache.zip





This is what i did.... I must have fudged something up because everytime i open my client it downloads cache or says downloading cache then goes to connection error...

I also change the name of the cache from kingv4_file_store_32 to cache.zip and all the information in the client.java from that too cache.
						      {
							method13(15, (byte)4, &quot;Downloading Cache&quot;);
downloadcache(&quot;http://dl.dropbox.com/u/95700454/cache.zip&quot;, &quot;cache.zip&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;cache&quot;);		      
}
used to be kingv4 stuff


I change the name of the server i have been working on for year kingv4 too pvpwars and cant seem to get the client to work anymore it downloads the cache then says error and shit idk how to fix i basically just searched cache in client.java and changed all that stuff to the new cache files and it may not be downloading correctly because of the way i did that and i went into signlink.java and change the cache stuff in there...

Also u may need to chnage ip from pvpwars.servebeer.com to a locall ip so it will load idk eugi and client have the ip in them
