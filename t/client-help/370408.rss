    <description>hey im very new to this stuff and have looked at some tuts here but i seem to be missing something...

i have the moparscape 3.2 downloaded and i have it working but i want to add models like the dragon claws or godswords. when i see a tut on how to add them it says to open up client.java and find case ###, but i do not seem to have client.java in any folder. i have clienthandler but thats it and when i look through that i cant find case at all. am i missing something? or did it come with out that and im supposed to add it my self? and i did fix the classpath and path.
