    <description>I can get any client to run my server is that correct? Well not ANY but one thats compatable with my server?

Also can I portforward from a laptop thats using wifi from a different computer in my house. And when I go to portforward I have Verizon and it seems I have limited access when portforwarding. And I can&#39;t put both on the Protocol how should I go about with this?

Thank you.</description>
