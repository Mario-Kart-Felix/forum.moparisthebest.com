    <title>Nulling Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nulling-error/337170</link>
    <description>Ugh, well I&#39;m having problems with my main character file. When I try to login to the server, this shows up in my run batch file. I figured the character file was nulled, so I deleted it, and tried to make a new one by logging in. I still get this error. It works on other account names, but not this one.
