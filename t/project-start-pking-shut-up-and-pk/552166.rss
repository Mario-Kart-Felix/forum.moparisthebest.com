[LEFT][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=orange]Description[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
I am not going to go on about my life or how long i&#39;ve been into RSPS. I&#39;ll just sum it all up and tell you what this server will consist of. It&#39;s going to be a PKing server and will consist of only PKing. You won&#39;t train anywhere, you will be given a large amount of experience to share within your combat skills. You can still earn experience from PKing or using your points you earn when you PK someone on experience lamps of some sort. The points you can spend will be earned throughout PKing, I haven&#39;t yet came up with a full plan for that yet. You will probably earn  points on every little thing you do, not always killing someone earns you points. You can ko successfully to earn more points or almost kill someone to get points. It&#39;s almost like an achievement system but you can always re-earn the achievement which gave you points. You can also sell every item for points, the cost of buying vs selling is way different. Selling an item back or selling an item in general will give you about 1/3 points that is initially cost. Other than that you just PK people and have fun. If you don&#39;t like PKing I don&#39;t advise coming to this server.

[LEFT][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=orange]Why choose this PK server among others?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][/LEFT]
First and foremost I have redone the entire combat system effectively. It&#39;s not some massively over processed system which can cause possible lag (developers don&#39;t come on here ranting on about how it won&#39;t change anything, blah blah). I am a perfectionist and I have highly compared it to my PKing days (old school). I have had a few people come on the server and test some things and they say my system &#39;feels&#39; flawless and extremely nice. It&#39;s more of something you have to give a go before you can really give some feedback. I have fixed tons of little problems. From the arrows not shooting out of the bow correctly to perfectly timing every combo. 

[LEFT][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=orange]My Reasoning[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][/LEFT]
The main reason I am trying my best to make it so good is because I do this for a hobby and I enjoy it. I am not here for money or player count, I want to play too. I plan on destroying whoever that&#39;s in wild. Whether I have 10 players or 100 players I&#39;ll PK you over and over or try my best to do so. All it is for me is fun and games, I enjoy RSPS, PKing, and programming. The server is still being developed but there&#39;s not too much to develop on PKing servers. It has taken me longer because I have redone a lot of content. However, if you&#39;re interested you could always come join the community forums until release and stay more up to date on everything. 

[LEFT][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=orange]Also...[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][/LEFT]
I would like to say one more thing about everything, which is every special effect of weapons or armors are exactly the way Oldschool RS Wiki says. Every little special attack or strength bonus or anything special any special effect has is there. Anything a weapon can do will do on here. I make sure everything is exact, if it&#39;s not exact I&#39;ll make sure I make it that way.

[SPOILER=Media][CENTER]
Some of the things I have shared in media may seem odd but I&#39;ve seen other 317 servers have all of these wrong. I also may be posting odd things because I take pride in the entire new combat system it took me a bit to make. 

Excuse my GIF images but they are laggy, sorry for that. I didn&#39;t show a ton of content but I showed a few weapons and styles of fighting. Comparable to OSRS or older runescape days. I didn&#39;t have a good idea on what exactly to show because there&#39;s so many small areas you have to hit to just show off all of PKing. That would be too much to show so I grabbed just a few things I could think up off the top of my head. 

Spawn Interface
[img]http://i.imgur.com/sQOQOSF.gif[/img]

Starter interface which allows you to customize your skills upon start. You will be able to choose a certain amount of exp and points. Points is described above. 
[img]http://i.imgur.com/xTJ1SLo.gif[/img]

Here is a crystal bow and mainly I am showing off the arrow leaving the bow on correct times, nothing special it&#39;s just one of my examples of the smaller things that are programmed to make everything more effective and more enjoyable
[img]http://i.imgur.com/doxe1Id.gif[/img]

[img]http://i.imgur.com/S63W2ay.gif[/img]

[img]http://i.imgur.com/VPHfH5V.gif[/img]

[img]http://i.imgur.com/X3IFQ3y.gif[/img]

Here is an example of very accurate combat timing formulas. Switching and combos are nearly perfect
[img]http://i.imgur.com/fgAMmaO.gif[/img]

This is only showing poisons, this was from a DDS . There are plenty of weapons/arrows/darts/spells that can poison.

Here I am eating and you can see my player pause until next time to hit and it automatically does so, first time i ate there wasnt an animation.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/SoVasaE.gif[/img]

You probably wont be able to catch the equipment screens magic attack bonus which is -67 and when it&#39;s around that area on OSRS you will splash 

constantly and this is just a form of showing very accurate magic bonus formulas.

Below is showing more magic defense with range armor vs melee armor

It’s going to be a PKing server and will consist of only PKing. You won’t train anywhere, you will be given a large amount of experience to share within your combat skills.
