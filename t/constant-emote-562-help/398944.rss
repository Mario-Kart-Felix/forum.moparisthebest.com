    <title>Constant emote [562] Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/constant-emote-562-help/398944</link>
    <description>I would like to add a fun command that is commonly found in servers. Its ::godon and ::godoff. I am using 562 painzone base. (credits to painzone)
I would like to know that code for constant emote while walking and everything. Thanks for help in advance. 

Would it look something like this?
[code]if(cmd[0].equals(&quot;godon&quot;)) {
setAnimation(1500);
            playerSE = 1501;
            playerSEW = 1851;
            playerSER = 1851;
            playerSEA = 1851;(1500);
player.sm(&quot;God mode activated&quot;);
   [/code]</description>
