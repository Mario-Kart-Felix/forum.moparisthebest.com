    <description>Hey everyone. 

A few months ago, those of you who&#39;s memories exceed my expectations my remember my mentioning i was writing a story.

Well, that story is all grown up now, and along with 2 other scripts, it has become a corner point of a website i am in production off.



Anyways, according to my critics, my story, while great, lacks substance and subtext. 
So, i place myself at the mercy of this might community and beseech thee to show me someone who is good at story writing to read over my script and assist by adding some subtext to the whole thing. 

At the moment, i have just have pages of story. I believe the characters need to be developed more, in ways that don&#39;t necessarily effect the story. So, help me out people, show me someone who knows what they are talking about. 



EDIT.
Its 1am and im not drunk... So i may as well go sleep. Ill check back when im awake. So expect a reply in around T minus 8 hours....</description>

Story writing is one of the things i always seem to get 90-100% in in English…all the rest i fail so it balances out nicely.</p>
