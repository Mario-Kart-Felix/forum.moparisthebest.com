    <description>Do you think there is just thing as a god and &quot;Jesus&quot;?

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So many people don’t understand this.  This world/life is simply a test.  A trial.  You’re really not intended to be enjoying it, but if you do, so be it.  God does not promote violence.  But it really doesn’t matter anyway.  It’s hard to put into words, but if someone kills you, why does it matter?  Your spirit lives on, and isn’t that what’s important?  Death is a one-way street.  It’s an inevitable part of life, so if it happens earlier, does it really matter?  And whatever pain you’ll experience being murdered will probably be less than whatever you’ll experience if you live out the rest of your life.  Not saying I’m fine with being murdered right now.  Given the situation, all the evolution-derived mental triggers will probably force myself to attempt to save my life.</p>

<p>The Bible says that the ones who aren’t capable of sinning, or under stand sin, Even Accept Jesus Christ. They’re apparently  on a get out of Jail free pass (e.g. Special Children, Babies, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have yet to find a Biblical reference which states that they get a free pass to heaven.  Because under that clause, the best thing to do for your children would be to abort them or kill them as they are born.  Hardly likely.</p>
<p>[quote=“jme_009, post:60, topic:133749”]Costs nothing? Hell it costs way too much in my opinion. Costs many hours of your time, donations, living a life in fear that you may go to hell for sinning, etc</p>
<p>Personally I’d rather spend my Sunday’s watching nascar. And it’s not as simple as “believing god just incase.” If I tried to believe in god, I would only be trying to fool myself. I simply don’t, and can’t, believe in a god. I can’t just suddenly believe in god.</p>
<p>I keep an open mind though, I know god is a possibility but it’s just not something I believe. I don’t want to go to heaven anyways. 80 years is enough, I don’t need eternity. I’d rather rot in the ground. [/quote]</p>
<p>It costs hours, true.  But if you enjoy it, is it wasted any more than hours smoking a joint?  Offering is always optional.  And there is no need to be afraid of sinning if you understand the concept of Christianity.  It’s a pity to reject something without making attempts to comprehending it first.</p>
<p>And church isn’t just about wasting time for the sake of wasting time.  It’s about making connections with people, growing in character, and all that fun stuff.  Being a Christian does not entail suddenly believing in God.  As a Christian, I wonder so many times whether there is a God after all.  It’s not a one-time deal, flipping a switch from ‘non-believing’ to ‘believing.’</p>
<p>Stating that you <span class="bbcode-i">cannot</span> believe in a God doesn’t sound like being open-minded, imo.  80 years of what is enough?  It’s not either heaven or death.  It’s heaven and hell.  Rotting in the ground isn’t</p>
<p>[quote=“Schizzo, post:61, topic:133749”]I do believe in God and Jesus and I’m a Christian. The way I see it is, even if there isn’t a God or anything (even though I thoroughly believe there is), I’m still in perfectly good shape when I die. Whether or not I’m right or wrong about my religion, I’m ok.  However, if someone’s an atheist and they’re wrong when they die, they’re going to hell for eternity.</p>
<p>I’d rather be an incorrect Christian than an incorrect atheist.[/quote]</p>
<p>Pascal’s Gambit ftl?  Why apply a statistical model to Christianity?  And an overly-simplified one at that.</p>
<p>[quote=“3.65 kilos, post:63, topic:133749”]Kinda off topic, but I wanted to add it.</p>
<p>The Romans feared that Jesus would lead an uprising (He had thousands of followers that would do whatever he asked). To them, he was an enemy of the state. Jesus was arrested and put on trial before Pontius Pilate, the Roman Governor. Soon afterward, Jesus was crucified.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also offtopic…and him dieing by means of crucifixion(sp?) was nothing special. In the Punic Wars, thousands of Carthaginians were crucified. It’s just Rome’s way of killing people.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for the summary of the Gospels.  And btw, no one said crucifixion was anything special.  Dying on the cross in and of itself was anything special.

<p>The Romans feared that Jesus would lead an uprising (He had thousands of followers that would do whatever he asked). To them, he was an enemy of the state. Jesus was arrested and put on trial before Pontius Pilate, the Roman Governor. Soon afterward, Jesus was crucified.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also offtopic…and him dieing by means of crucifixion(sp?) was nothing special. In the Punic Wars, thousands of Carthaginians were crucified. It’s just Rome’s way of killing people.</p>

Whether or not I’m right or wrong about my religion, I’m ok.  However, if someone’s an atheist and they’re wrong when they die, they’re going to hell for eternity.</p>

<p>Costs nothing? Hell it costs way too much in my opinion. Costs many hours of your time, donations, living a life in fear that you may go to hell for sinning, etc</p>
<p>Personally I’d rather spend my Sunday’s watching nascar. And it’s not as simple as “believing god just incase.” If I tried to believe in god, I would only be trying to fool myself. I simply don’t, and can’t, believe in a god. I can’t just suddenly believe in god.</p>
<p>I keep an open mind though, I know god is a possibility but it’s just not something I believe. I don’t want to go to heaven anyways. 80 years is enough, I don’t need eternity. I’d rather rot in the ground.</p>
