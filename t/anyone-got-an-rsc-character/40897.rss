    <title>Anyone got an RSC character?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-got-an-rsc-character/40897</link>
    <description>Hey has anyone got an RSC account that me an Iamadam can use?

We&#39;re developing a private server and are desperate for some packet dumps, I know these accounts are worth alot so i&#39;m not expecting to get access to one, but I may as well give it a shot.

Much love &lt;3</description>

Wow so your a scammer?
<p>Also, I joined SBoT196, thats when I started RS cheating, I was around at kaitnieks etc. but them members are classed as new to me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If you wernt on the RSC196ish forums (reinet and all) I won’t know you and you most likely won’t know me.</p>
<p>The name was created when I first started RSC cheating, it was my RSC name, a suckup name to RichyT basically; and then it stuck with me.</p>
<p>Also, jimmy please don’t feel forced into it although I really really do need this char &lt;3 (Also if you like set recoveries I couldn’t scam you anyway, could I?)</p>
<p>Also getting banned from RSR == loss of ARGA too (Although I worked on it and have the transformer source anyways)</p>

<p>Well from your name, did you have anything to do with SBot? OR is it just the name… Second of all, were you at Kaitnieks? If you were at both of those, then don’t be calling me new, because I was right there with you. And what would matter more, a RSC account or a Rs-Resources account? I would give up a forum account any day to scam a RSC account.</p>
