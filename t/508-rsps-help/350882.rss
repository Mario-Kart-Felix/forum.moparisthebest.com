    <description>Hi everyone, I&#39;m pretty new to coding, and I&#39;m currently trying to code a 508. I have some things down and understood, but there&#39;s a lot of things that I don&#39;t know, and I would like someone who is pretty familiar with coding to help me with the coding and how to fix glitches and stuff. I don&#39;t need a coder unless someone would like to help me until my server is actually finished and he/she could be co-owner/coder, but I would like to have someone I could ask questions to about pretty much anything related to coding, like where to look for what and how to do things, ect. So if anyone could just be like a help contact it would be great! Thanks. :) you can contact me via MSN: jak_teh_elf@live.com or just leave a reply.</description>

              <p>Requesting a coder is not allowed unfortunately.<br>
If you want specific help, you can edit your post with an exact question and I would be glad to help.</p>
