    <title>Food timer for sharks?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/food-timer-for-sharks/175123</link>
    <description>Ok, when I eat a shark, I can just keep eating sharks, theres no timer for it, I want to make a timer for eating sharks. I looked in client.java and did alt+F for 385 (ID for shark). I found this code, [code]case 385: //Shark
				healing[1] = 20;
				healing[2] = 20;
				healing[3] = -1;
				break;[/code] 
What do I change to make a timer? Please help :)</description>
