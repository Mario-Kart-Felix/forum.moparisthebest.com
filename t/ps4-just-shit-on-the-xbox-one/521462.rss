I clearly just stated that we are looking at possibly more than 2 gigs or more memory allocated to OS on the Xbox One compared to the PS4, so no. There is just more. Either way you’re still incapable of saying that the Xbox One is better than the PS4, it is clearly not physically valid. Do not try to put down the PS4’s SUPERIOR GPU just because you think that upon personal preference that the Xbox One is superior in any way, that is just sad.</p>

<p>I’m not an AMD fanboy, I don’t know the differences between the 2 cards. He said he would only trust his news source, and those 2 quotes are directly from it. If what Cole said is true, the PS4 blows the XBOne out of the water.</p>

<p>I’ve never even owned a playstation. I’ve had an Xbox360 for 6 years and loved it. This next generation I’m not even getting a console. You’ve been saying “Kinect is better than the eye” and then going off saying “you can’t say Eye is better because you’ve never tried it”. I’ve posted the spec differences of PS4 and XBone and you’ve flat-out ignored them with the same “but they’re <span class="bbcode-i">basically</span> the same” when they absolutely aren’t.[/quote]<br>
I will take this source over what you say about the hardware of each console.<br>

<p>I’ve never even owned a playstation. I’ve had an Xbox360 for 6 years and loved it. This next generation I’m not even getting a console. You’ve been saying “Kinect is better than the eye” and then going off saying “you can’t say Eye is better because you’ve never tried it”. I’ve posted the spec differences of PS4 and XBone and you’ve flat-out ignored them with the same “but they’re <span class="bbcode-i">basically</span> the same” when they absolutely aren’t.</p>

As for the Kinect, again, you can’t say it’s laggy because you haven’t used it because it has been upgraded for the Xbox One.<br>

Then how can you say exbucks is better if you haven’t played it?<br>
We’ve seen enough tech demos and with the released specs they’ve shown, anyone with half a mind can tell that the better deal is the PS4.[/quote]<br>
Oh, you didn’t rip on me about saying that the hardware specs are very similar?</p>
<p>I’m saying that the Xbox One is better because I’m an Xbox fan. You’re obviously saying that the PS4 is better because you’re a Playstation fan. It’s pretty simple if you think about it.</p>

If they have “basically the same hardware” (they don’t), why would the xbone be $100 more expensive?</p>
<p>The PS4 has 8GB GDDR5 RAM, XBone has 8GB DDR3. Those aren’t “basically the same”.</p>

<p>The Xbox One comes with the Kinect, which of course, would make the price higher. For the PS4, it does not come with the Playstation Eye, it is a $59 add-on. And we all know that the Kinect is better than the Eye.</p>

<blockquote>Microsoft's Xbox One console has already had something of a social media problem. And it turns out despite the company's recent about-face on some its new console's most controversial feature, this Internet problem extends to search engines. Well, every search except for Bing.
<p>Type the phrase “the xbox one is…” into popular search engines Google and Yahoo, and you’ll see the rest autofilled with some nasty results — “the xbox one is terrible,” “the xbox one is a joke,” “the xbox one is ugly.” Things like that.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, when the same phrase was put into Bing (the search engine that just happens to be owned by the same company currently preparing the Xbox One for market), it came up with the rosy phrase “the xbox one is amazing.”</p>
<p>Coincidence? I don’t want to jump to any accusations or conclusions. But if the swift departure of Microsoft studios creative director Adam Orth following his impolite Twitter rejoinders is any indication, the Redmond, WA-based tech giant doesn’t have much patience for online snafus at the moment.</p>
<p>Strangly enough, on the word “the” was taken out of the equation, Bing’s search results fall more in line with those of its rivals, as show by the image below:</p>

<p>This. Also, the PS4 and Xbox One have similar hardware that produce almost the same thing. It all depends on the software involved, like someone stated in one of the previous pages. Xbox LIVE, although you have to pay for it, is a lot more appealing and offers a lot more of content to do, play, etc… I have played on a PS3 before and I have first hand experience that it is not as good as the Xbox dashboard. The Xbox dashboard also isn’t as ‘dark’ as the PS3 and it is somewhat customizable with the background (Not sure if the PS3 dashboard is custonmizable or not).</p>

<p>Yes the PS3 UI can be customized, just like the 360. Being a PS+ member gives you free access to a handful of games every month, as well as access to their video and music streaming services. The PS4 UI has had a huge overhaul, and hopefully it is much nicer to use. Microsoft hasn’t changed the UI all that much, so we have to wait and see if Sony improved.</p>

<p>For the price point the hardware you get definitely isn’t too bad. Build me an 8 core PC with 8gb of GDDR5 ram for $400 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>$400 for the console, plus $60 a year for PS+ and it still takes several years before you reach the base cost of a high end rig. Even if we have to wait 6 years for another gen of consoles its still $760 in total for the PS4.</p>
