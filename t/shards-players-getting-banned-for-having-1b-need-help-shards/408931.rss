    <title>[Shards] Players getting banned for having 1b+ NEED HELP [Shards]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shards-players-getting-banned-for-having-1b-need-help-shards/408931</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a source, that is Shards based. If players exceed over 1b wealth on their account, it bans them for &quot;duping&quot;. If i unban them, when they login, it bans there account again. I have no idea how to fix this. Ive searched everywhere in the server files, loking for what bans the player when they have 1b+ wealth. I couldnt find anything. I really need help on this, if anyone can help id be most greatful!</description>

              <p>Look for an if statement that prob stats with if(playerHasItems(995, 10000000); or something similar and it should have like the ban format under it.</p>

              <p>Well first your auto banning if they have 1b right? well if they login they still have that 1b, so it’s just going to re auto ban, so edit there bank to whatever money you want them to have before you un-ban them.</p>
