<p>Lol, no it’s not. It’s original creators abandoned it for a reason…[/quote]<br>
I said, “Why bother? Just using RSCD is more advanced/stable.” and you replied with, “Lol, no it’s not.”</p>
<p>How could you have meant anything else other than RSCD is not more advanced/stable than Demonik? I really don’t think you should be telling me to read…</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>And no, they didn’t get bored. They were disgusted by it’s ugly design, it’s NOT stable, unless you modify most of the code. Of course, I wouldn’t expect you to know since Zilent does that for you…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s unstable if you have a lot online but most of the instability issues are unpatched exploits. When we had RSCD running with practically no edits what-so-ever it was up for 2-3 weeks straight with 100-200 players online at all times until we got took down by an exploit. With a connection/packet throttle, secured server and secured web files (nothing to do with RSCD’s design or code), the packet encoding/decoding changed to Stork’s and a few other little bits it will quite easily be up for weeks on end with 200+ online (which is far more than any new server is likely to see).</p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s the best and I’m not saying most of it can’t be improved but it’s far, far more stable than Demonik and far, far, far more stable than the ‘RscReloaded’ as when I actually went on it spawning 6 NPC’s in the same area would disconnect everyone for example…[/quote]</p>
<p>Where the hell do you get your logic from? Your ass? I clearly said right under “&amp;^ who the hell is dumb enough to continue demonik…”, one would assume that I was meaning neither sources (which are from the same RSCD base) are advanced.
