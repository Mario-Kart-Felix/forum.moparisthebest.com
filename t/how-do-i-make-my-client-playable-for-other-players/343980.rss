    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-my-client-playable-for-other-players/343980</link>
    <description>Ok so basically I have everything port fowarded. I have everything up and running. I uploaded the file to mediafire, and yes the client was zipped with Winrar. My friend tried downloading and when he opened client it bascically told him that it couldn&#39;t download the cache, retrying in - 10..9...8.. and so on. Why is this and how can I fix this?</description>
