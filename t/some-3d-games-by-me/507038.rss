    <title>Some 3D Games by me</title>

    <description>I had no clue mopar had a game dev section, but since r-s hates me for selling my veteran account, I might as well share with mopar :)

3 days in, and the basic prototype is completed for this small scale ghetto FPS.

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll finish this or not, it&#39;s mostly just 3D/networking practice before I implement networking into my 3D MORPG project.. 

Here&#39;s my work in progress MORPG, in development for longer than I&#39;d like to think about :D
