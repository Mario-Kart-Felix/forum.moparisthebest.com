    <description>[center]Hello fellow people i thought before we get started with images and information i&#39;d tell you who we are and why we have opened!!

Hello if you have been bothered too read this somewhere in this post is a code tell the owner the code and claim some goods. We are ridiculous-PK we started in 2013 we aimed to have a high quality server and many players which didn&#39;t happen as we had some undeveloped kids trying to tell me how to code i listened and it got messed up yeah you lot i know bad idea.

I never intended to make money from this server i made it for a Non-Profitable organization. Which is the best way to succeed in a server but sadly the server went under construction and i never had time to revive it.

So now i bring you ridiculous-PK! at last after 7 Months of down time its backup please enjoy and read along.
