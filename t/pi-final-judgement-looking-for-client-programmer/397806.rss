    <description>Well the server was originally a server for friends, but they all wanted me to actually start hosting it for the public so yeah... I have to go real soon so I will make this quick for now will make it this A LOT cleaner when I get back from relatives visiting today. I promise. I am in of a client programmer. If you wish to apply please submit your own application fromat below. ( I believe the way you present your own application is a big factor in the way you work and it shows how professional and serious you are as well.)

If you do not know a lot about clients do not apply it&#39;s simple as that really. Simple edits I can do myself I just need somebody who is familiar with with the galkon refactored clients.

I will be making a server development page for this later tonight as well.

              <p>I am not sure which PI I will start from, but I have decided not to continue this particular source as the shops are messing up with me no matter what I do. I have even totally redone the shophandler.java/shopassistant.java and nothing. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I may use Marchobs recent release not sure yet will have to see what is wrong with it.</p>

              <p>[quote=“zaz278, post:3, topic:397806”]I’ll help out server or client sided, depending on what it is babe. Also are you using your old source, cause I highly would not recommend it as it takes me like 10+ seconds to log in and i just think its fucked up you should start from a clean Project Insanity. Since I know you won’t use anything but PI. But yea I’ll help out with stuff if you want? :D. Why haven’t you been on msn lately.[/quote]My msn got hacked I got it backed now lol pm me your msn so I can re add all of my friends were blocked/deleted</p>
<p>I may consider actually starting on an original project insanity as a base I will still need a client coder though as I am horrible with them. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Also added a poll to find out if I should start out from stock PI or go to erased pkz</p>
<p>And Alex I have nothing wrong with Hyperion i just like the hyperion packaging. I still have hope for the base whether or not people like it.</p>
