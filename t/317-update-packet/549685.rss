    <title>317 Update packet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-update-packet/549685</link>
    <description>Hi,

Me and a friend are working on a runescape 317 server from scratch using netty.
We&#39;re at the point now where the initialize the player and have to send it&#39;s first update packet.

However, we don&#39;t know what to put in the packet.
The RSWiki doesn&#39;t contain specific information on what has to be sent. ([url=https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=317:Begin_player_updating]https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=317:Begin_player_updating[/url])

We tried looking at some open sourced servers at github but we find it very confusing to use it since they already have classes for players, equipment, etc.
Does anyone here have information about what needs to be sent in the update packet with the right order?

We currently only have this ([url=https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=317_Protocol#Player_Updating]https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=317_Protocol#Player_Updating[/url]) but this doesn&#39;t say specifically what has to be in the packet.</description>
