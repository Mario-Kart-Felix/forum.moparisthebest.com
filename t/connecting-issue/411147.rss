              <p>^lawl, as i keep saying to people … google is your friend fgs. but seeing as no one else has posted… you need to run the server, port forward, open egui or gui, change those ip’s to 127.0.0.1 (thats your computers local ip address) it will be 100% non accessable from other people</p>
