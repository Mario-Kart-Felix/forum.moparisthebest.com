    <title>Is there a way to do this? Few Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-a-way-to-do-this-few-questions/478964</link>
    <description>1st Question: Starter Gear
Is there a way to put it in 4 commands, and where after you die you can get the stuff again,
Classles like..

::Melee - Gives Melee PvP Gear
::Mage - Gives Mage PvP Gear
::Range - Gives Range PVP Gear
::Defence - Gives Defense PvP Gear

You are able to get any amount of gear and do this whenever you want to.

2nd Question: - Gambling NPC

I want a guy to stand out over by the bridge crossing the water near edgeville, where you are able to stake any items besides gold.  You just do &quot;Click Use&quot; and click on the vendor with the item you want to stake, if you win you get the item back and another item for free, if you lose you lose the item you staked.

But it has to be an NPC!

3rd Question: - Spawn Server
How can I make it to where everyone can spawn, but there are restrictions on some items?

4th Question: - Donator Shop
Need help of this one.

Can anyone help me with this stuff? That would be awesome.</description>

Easy, just do something such as(I’m assuming you’re using a PI server, since you didn’t say.)</p>
<p><code>if(command.equalsIgnoreCase("melee")) {
	c.getItems().addItem(1333, 1); //Rune Scimitar
	c.getItems().addItem(4151, 1); //Abyssal Whip
	c.getItems().addItem(995, 5000000); //5M Coins
}
</code><br>
Edit this to whatever items you want.</p>

This is very possible, just find your “itemonnpc” class if you have one, and edit it to your likings.</p>
<p>[quote=“ItsTheFinalCountdown, post:1, topic:478964”]3rd Question: - Spawn Server<br>
How can I make it to where everyone can spawn, but there are restrictions on some items?[/quote]<br>
Try using an array, as such:</p>
<p><code>int[] restrictions = { 4151, 1333, 11694 };
if(command.startsWith("item") /*&amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0*/) { //Added an unneeded code, since you can just delete that
//item command and right before the item spawning
	for(int items = 0; items &lt; restrictions.length; items++) {
		if(spawnItem == restrictions[items]) {	//spawnItem would be the item being added
			c.sendMessage("You can't spawn this item!")
			break;
		}
	}
	//The rest of the command
}</code></p>
<p>[quote=“ItsTheFinalCountdown, post:1, topic:478964”]4th Question: - Donator Shop<br>

This one I’m not too sure of, because I never had a donator shop.</p>
