    <title>DODIAN XIV UB3R SERVER! - no premium required</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dodian-xiv-ub3r-server-no-premium-required/548046</link>
    <description>Dodian, aka ub3r server, is a server that will never be forgotten in the RSPS community.  It was a server that changed RSPS&#39;s forever, and was taken from us.  Sadly today, there aren&#39;t many real old school servers out there, let alone servers similar to Dodian.  XIV wishes to fill that empty gap that has recently come for the older generation players, and the new who enjoy the older content.

Our goal is to establish a Dodian community again, but better than the original server ever was.  We have features on our server that were never on the original Dodian server.  We are proud to say that we are the most advanced Dodian re-make ever made.  We do not sell donator or member features(nor will we ever) so everyone can enjoy the server!  Our skilling system is unlike most servers because of all the content.  If you enjoyed the original server or any other re makes, I can guarantee that Dodian XIV will be the most fun you will have.  So come try us out, and experience the revival of one of the greatest servers ever.
