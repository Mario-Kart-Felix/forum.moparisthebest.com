    <title>NRS3 Compiling error &amp; Client Class</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nrs3-compiling-error-client-class/547417</link>
    <description>Hello there,
I have been working on NrS3 for fun as of recently, I&#39;ve been trying to find a client to test it out and I&#39;ve found 3 clients so far but it seems like they all have a Virus.. /:
The minute I download them and extract the folder from the (Archive) my AVG detects it and pops up.

Here&#39;s what it shows me;

I hope someone can tell me what that is and if it&#39;s an actual virus or not?

Now, 
after compiling my server, 
I&#39;m getting a TriviaBot Error. 
I thought you just had to add the &quot;Com/Import&quot; to somewhere? But i&#39;m not completely sure.

Here&#39;s a picture of the compiler error I&#39;ve been getting;

I hope someone can help me, any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.</description>
