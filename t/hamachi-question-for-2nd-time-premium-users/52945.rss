    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hamachi-question-for-2nd-time-premium-users/52945</link>
    <description>Okay since this wasn&#39;t in the guide i don&#39;t want to see any Url links to any guides unless you know it
can answer my question. 

Okay i have Hamachi Premium and when it runs out will it keep the networks that i already have on their? 
Or will it delete so i have to rejoin each and every network again. I know all the benefits but this i&#39;m not
sure of.</description>
