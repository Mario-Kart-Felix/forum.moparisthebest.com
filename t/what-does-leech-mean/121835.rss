    <title>What does leech mean?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-does-leech-mean/121835</link>
    <description>Well, it seems my understanding of the word &quot;leech&quot; differs from a lot of new people, so I&#39;m going to take a few minutes to write the meaning of this word, so it isn&#39;t horrifically used as it is.

Lets start. Back in the day of Kaitnieks, a leecher was a person to come, download a few SCAR scripts and leave without posting. Now, according to dictionary.com, leech means the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;2.	a person who clings to another for personal gain, esp. without giving anything in return, and usually with the implication or effect of exhausting the other&#39;s resources; parasite.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But why did I make this thread? In graphics section, if someone posts an uber sig, some kid with no life has to ruin the posters day by posting the possibility he stole it, usually with &quot;this is leeched&quot;. Let me simplify this: &quot;This is a person who takes something for personal gain giving nothing into return&quot;, this can mean a lot of things, now, onto the second word of the day, &quot;rip&quot;, if someone rips a sig, they simply put their name on it. Lets look at the definition for &quot;rip&quot; on dictionary.com:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]9. Rip off, Slang.[/b]
a.	to steal or pilfer.
b.	to rob or steal from.
c.	to swindle, cheat, or exploit; take advantage of: phony charity appeals that rip off a gullible public.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, lets say someone posted an uber sig, and the person that said leech before, now said &quot;this is ripped&quot;, I&#39;ll simplify that, &quot;This person stole that sig&quot;.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
  If you want to be a noob, and moronically submit your claim of theft, use the correct words.</description>

Leech is someone who “sucks” the life or property from another person in order to survive or make themselves feel alive. Exactly like a real life leech.</p>

<p>I find it extremely improbable that an image intended for a signature could be used as wallpaper.  And as it stands, those graphics stealers are still rippers, yes?  And if it is for personal use, there would be no way to identify a leecher?</p>
<p>And for the most part, there is no reason to delineate between a graphics ripper and a graphics leecher.  There is no advantage for distinguishing between the two camps, and using an arbitrary word in a debatable application is simply asking for misinterpretation.</p>

<p>in the case of a sig, to “leech” it is to take and possibly use it without giving any comment on it or credits to the creator of the sig. to “rip” the sig would be to take and possibly use the sig, maybe make some sort of comment on it, and to still not give any credits to the creator. both of these are without persission. to “(im not sure of the word for it)” is to take and possibly use the sig with permission of the creator and unless the creator said you did not have to, give credits to the creator.</p>

              <p>in the case of a sig, to “leech” it is to take and possibly use it without giving any comment on it or credits to the creator of the sig. to “rip” the sig would be to take and possibly use the sig, maybe make some sort of comment on it, and to still not give any credits to the creator. both of these are without persission. to “(im not sure of the word for it)” is to take and possibly use the sig with permission of the creator and unless the creator said you did not have to, give credits to the creator.</p>

<p>Either way it’s ripping.  ‘Leeching’ a sig, as you define it, has the same effect as ripping a sig, therefore should not deserve a different name.  Regardless, in graphics forums, there is no way to tell the difference between a ‘leeched’ sig and a ripped sig.  Therefore, all stolen sigs are ripped, and there is no way to ‘leech’ a sig.</p>

<p>The use of “this is leeched” emerged at moparscape boards and migrated to here like a flock of birds, sure, it’s one thing saying the general moparscaper isn’t fully educated in English skills but it’s getting annoying when it constantly pops up.</p>
<p>Sure, blatant claims of stolen sigs(sigs is my example) is fine, but how on earth can you leech a sig?</p>
