    <title>Runescape Money Making Guide!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-money-making-guide/272483</link>
    <description>Hi i have been seening many sites claiming that their money making guide is the best, but i think that some of them are fake. so basically i just added a bunch of stuffs up, hope you guys like it!

sorry about the font, too lazy to edit it :P, hey it&#39;s not my fault that i just woke up...

REQUIREMENTS: COMPLETING THE RUNE MYSTERIES QUEST
                       FINISH THE TUTORIAL ISLAND
                       KNOW HOW TO USE THE GRAND EXCHANGE...
and lastly...       HAVE A FREAKEN BRIAN!

First of all, you came off tutorial island without any money but the 25gp in your bank. sell all your stuffs to the bank except for the axe, pickaxe, and net. DO NOT SELL THE RUNES!!! 

after you sell the junks, you will have some money now. walk all the way to draynor village and bank all the axes and stuffs. but dont bank the runes, since you will now sell them to the rune shop!
take out your money and your runes and walk to betty&#39;s rune shop in port sarim! then sell all your runes. you should have about 300gp? now your inventory should only have 1 slot for gold and the others are empty. Now, buy eye of newts from the rune shop and then walk back to draynor.
repeat this step until all your money are gone. now you might be thinking &quot;darn i should&#39;nt have listen to this !@#$&quot; but your wrong. listen to what i am going to tell you now. sell all the eye of newts to the grand exchange! which will help you make over 10k i suppose?

Now you have 2 choices!
1: continue with eye of newts to save up money to continue to 2
2: start buying rune essence from grand exchange and do air running(must have finished rune mysteries)

if you want to do choice 1, walk back to draynor with your money in bank (to be safe in case of highway mans) now take out your money and go to betty&#39;s rune shop to buy eye of newts. REPEAT
you know what to do after you use up all your money... you sell them at the grand exchange!!!

for choice 2, you can buy as many rune essence as you can. then as i have said above, you should have a air talisman from the quest. so get your air talisman or buy a air tiara if you want to make more money.

Now, get your air tiara/tally and go to fally. walk all the way down to the air alter and find someone who says : &quot;9x&quot;! or &quot;8x&quot;! right-click and select Req Assist. if they have started assisting you. the game will say &quot;(playername) is now assisting you. also to be sure. type their name in the highscore (sometimes people try to lie so you can help them get exp... kinda mean right? :mad:. o well lets get on. after they started to assist you, click on the rune alter. the big air rune thingy in the middle of the stranded island(in high detail) or mountain(in standard detail) to craft all your runes. dont worry, you wont get any exp. the person that is gettin exp is the one that is assisting you. now, keep repeating this step.

after you used all your rune essence, you should have over 2k air runes? now walk all the way back to the grand exchange and sell all your air runes, (WARNING: take out your air runes in grand-exchange)! after all these steps, you might want to start merchanting! go to world one and use the grand exchange to buy air runes at the lowest price. after, use a auto typer or type this yourself 
&quot;buying air runes in GE for 12gp!!!&quot; make the words move by adding wave or stuffs if you want... not like i care =). now after you bought alot of air runes, sell them at grand exchange at medium price. high price if you want to, but might take a year?

i can garentee that if you fallow my guide, you can even make 100k or even more if you do all these!</description>

              <p>Hi i have been seening many sites claiming that their money making guide is the best, but i think that some of them are fake. so basically i just added a bunch of stuffs up, hope you guys like it!</p>
<p>sorry about the font, too lazy to edit it :P, hey it’s not my fault that i just woke up…</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: COMPLETING THE RUNE MYSTERIES QUEST<br>
FINISH THE TUTORIAL ISLAND<br>
KNOW HOW TO USE THE GRAND EXCHANGE…<br>
and lastly…       HAVE A FREAKEN BRIAN!</p>
<p>First of all, you came off tutorial island without any money but the 25gp in your bank. sell all your stuffs to the bank except for the axe, pickaxe, and net. DO NOT SELL THE RUNES!!!</p>
<p>after you sell the junks, you will have some money now. walk all the way to draynor village and bank all the axes and stuffs. but dont bank the runes, since you will now sell them to the rune shop!<br>
take out your money and your runes and walk to betty’s rune shop in port sarim! then sell all your runes. you should have about 300gp? now your inventory should only have 1 slot for gold and the others are empty. Now, buy eye of newts from the rune shop and then walk back to draynor.<br>
repeat this step until all your money are gone. now you might be thinking “darn i should’nt have listen to this !@#$” but your wrong. listen to what i am going to tell you now. sell all the eye of newts to the grand exchange! which will help you make over 10k i suppose?</p>
<p>Now you have 2 choices!<br>
1: continue with eye of newts to save up money to continue to 2<br>
2: start buying rune essence from grand exchange and do air running(must have finished rune mysteries)</p>
<p>if you want to do choice 1, walk back to draynor with your money in bank (to be safe in case of highway mans) now take out your money and go to betty’s rune shop to buy eye of newts. REPEAT<br>
you know what to do after you use up all your money… you sell them at the grand exchange!!!</p>
<p>for choice 2, you can buy as many rune essence as you can. then as i have said above, you should have a air talisman from the quest. so get your air talisman or buy a air tiara if you want to make more money.</p>
<p>Now, get your air tiara/tally and go to fally. walk all the way down to the air alter and find someone who says : “9x”! or “8x”! right-click and select Req Assist. if they have started assisting you. the game will say "(playername) is now assisting you. also to be sure. type their name in the highscore (sometimes people try to lie so you can help them get exp… kinda mean right? :mad:. o well lets get on. after they started to assist you, click on the rune alter. the big air rune thingy in the middle of the stranded island(in high detail) or mountain(in standard detail) to craft all your runes. dont worry, you wont get any exp. the person that is gettin exp is the one that is assisting you. now, keep repeating this step.</p>
<p>after you used all your rune essence, you should have over 2k air runes? now walk all the way back to the grand exchange and sell all your air runes, (WARNING: take out your air runes in grand-exchange)! after all these steps, you might want to start merchanting! go to world one and use the grand exchange to buy air runes at the lowest price. after, use a auto typer or type this yourself<br>
“buying air runes in GE for 12gp!!!” make the words move by adding wave or stuffs if you want… not like i care =). now after you bought alot of air runes, sell them at grand exchange at medium price. high price if you want to, but might take a year?</p>
<p>i can garentee that if you fallow my guide, you can even make 100k or even more if you do all these!</p>
