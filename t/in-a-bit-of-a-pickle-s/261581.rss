But make sure that you inserted your shop into the <span class="bbcode-b">One Click NPC</span> method. If you didn’t do this correctly then you would have problems with opening the shop.<br>

<p>ok well i have deleted all of the spawns of the npcs for the shops i will have to go into the client document and edit them out am i right?</p>
<p>also the one click method i may have missed that in a tutorial ill give it a search now, thanks</p>

<p>Yes you will need to remove the wanneshops if you removed the NPCs opening them, and have edited them out of the shops configuration file.</p>
