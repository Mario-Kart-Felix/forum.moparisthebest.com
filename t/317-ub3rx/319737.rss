[sup][size=2]Ever wanted to [b]restart...[/b][/size][/sup]

[sub][b]Brief History[/b]
Well as most people here have; I started learning [i]runescript[/i] just under two years ago. So I have a basic knowledge and can base alot of updates off of to the top of my head. But there no point in me writting about that, your hear to read about another [b]&quot;old-school&quot;[/b] project that will just fail in a month for so. I am one of the smart one; I will never rule out the chance of being shut down. Hense why I have many other projects to tend to before the time comes.

I made mod in [b]*******[/b] and was thrilled. I learned alot about players and how much things chance once you become an authority figure. But that doesnt matter, because it&#39;s not enough for me. I needed to learn how everything worked. And once that&#39;s figured out; you can only enjoy the brilliant servers out there. But as mentioned; there all shut down.

That&#39;s a small personal history, you can guess what happens after. [i]Guy plays server, guy gets mod, guy wants to make server, server fails, then gets determined and creates unique server.[/i] [b]*Blah*Blah*Blah*[/b]

[/sub]

[b]Notes*[/b]
[i]I will give all credits to all who have served me well :).[/i]

[sub][b]Will post development once I get up tomorrow morning. At the moment it is 11pm.

Thanks.[/b][/sub]

I woke up this morning and made a couple client changes. Insignificant but just small development. And I discovered that Devolution already has alot of skills implemented into it but I get to choose how and when they can be accessed. My favourate is smithing of course, full working interfaces ;) &lt;3 Back to work.

[i]Changed the &#39;error connecting to server&#39; text with &#39;the server is being updated please try again in 1 minute.&#39;[/i]

[img]http://img686.imageshack.us/img686/6190/more.png[/img]

Added some dialogue with some extra items, and a guild to take you to the agiltiy course. Will soon add the course objects &amp; exchange. Also will add another &#39;rogue&#39; to take you to the theiving area. Possibly the rogues den. That&#39;s all for today/tonight.

[b]The images with twin interfaces (like shops &amp; dialogue or bars &amp; smithing) have been cropped the server is not like that, I&#39;m not that noob. :P[/b]

[b]Note*[/b]
[i]Just incase for the people that haven&#39;t played runescape before 2005. There wern&#39;t any skillcapes, no newish weapons. There was dragon and barrows. Thats all. Not even amulets of fury nor fire capes. I am going to keep my server this way, the best cape of looks is preferably the legends cape.

This is to ensure enjoyment in pk&#39;ing aswell as training. A player comes up in a skillcape most people would think that, that person must be a really good player so I&#39;ll suck up to him? I want to try and may this game equal for everybody. Skillcapes (sorry) are a waste of time and so are godswords, they&#39;re implemented to shutup the players of today saying newer is better and old players aren&#39;t strong enough or some other insult. That&#39;s all.

[b]Added membership; if needed I will implement this into the game. But theres not much point when it&#39;s in alpha. Just a nice thing to learn how to add.

<p>Added some dialogue with some extra items, and a guild to take you to the agiltiy course. Will soon add the course objects &amp; exchange. Also will add another ‘rogue’ to take you to the theiving area. Possibly the rogues den. That’s all for today/tonight.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The images with twin interfaces (like shops &amp; dialogue or bars &amp; smithing) have been cropped the server is not like that, I’m not that noob. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></span></p>

[i]Just incase for the people that haven’t played runescape before 2005. There wern’t any skillcapes, no newish weapons. There was dragon and barrows. Thats all. Not even amulets of fury nor fire capes. I am going to keep my server this way, the best cape of looks is preferably the legends cape.</p>
<p>This is to ensure enjoyment in pk’ing aswell as training. A player comes up in a skillcape most people would think that, that person must be a really good player so I’ll suck up to him? I want to try and may this game equal for everybody. Skillcapes (sorry) are a waste of time and so are godswords, they’re implemented to shutup the players of today saying newer is better and old players aren’t strong enough or some other insult. That’s all.</p>
<p>[b]Added membership; if needed I will implement this into the game. But theres not much point when it’s in alpha. Just a nice thing to learn how to add.</p>
