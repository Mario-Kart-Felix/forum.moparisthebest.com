        <p>90+% professional games and software are made using C++, and most of them also use an internal scripting language.</p>
<p>One exception to this is of course the runescape client, which in order to be run in a web browser it is made in java. However, the runescape server itself is most likely programmed in C++.</p>

        <p>Just a clarification, the runescape client is made in java and the runescape server is probably made in C++. Runescript is probably the internal scripting language they are using. An internal scripting language is, for example, Scar’s pascal script. Scar itself is made in Delphi, but it reads and executes Pascal scripts, which allow the user (or in RS’s case, the quest and content developers) to modify the behaviour of the program or add features without having to recompile the program and without having to deal with the lower level language.</p>

        <p>C++, hands down for extensive lush environments.<br>
Java, for multiple platform, extensive lush environments (with of course the necessary native packages, d3d opengl etc).<br>
C if you want ALOT of code that is HARD to follow but is very efficient.<br>
[hr]<br>
And just for clarification, the runescape server is written in java.</p>
<p>FOR PROOF: Java is not low end enough to provide responses to ping requests, try pinging the server.</p>
<p>The server Name is “JaGeX 3.1”… Also standard for java to rename the server… Not to mention all the file types are “ws” webservlet (java)… lol. There’s plenty more reasons for those whom look.</p>

<p>When I still used the rs forums, there was a topic about why there wasn’t an update on schedule once after it had been 9 weeks without one. The resonse from ‘Andrew’ was that “We are updating RuneScript. The core part of the game is written in Java, but runescript is a component that allows us to add updates as frequently as we used to. While …”<br>
so the server is written in Java, and has an interpreter for ‘runescript’ that controls most of the gaming. As for your statement about ‘speed being critical’, well, you’ve obviously never been in a bank on world 2.</p>

<p>Don’t kill me please. Joking, what’s up with you though, no need to get aggressive. Bytecode languages are less efficient than C++, and that’s a fact. If in any aspect a byte code language is more efficient, it is only because the C++ programmer didn’t make a good job. Otherwise most programs would be made in java, as it is platform independant and easier to debug, but reality shows that most are made in C++. And that’s because it’s more efficient. Proof?</p>

<p>Of course, the list follows, but you can just clicking benchmarks in google or do one yourself if you feel like it. Any benchmark in which Java may beat C++, either in speed or memory usage, is just because the person is not a good C++ programmer and doesn’t know how to manage memory properly. After all, the java virtual machine itself is written in C++.</p>
<p>Also, I will not believe the supposed proof that the server is written in java until Andrew says that himself.<br>
The sentence isn’t clear enough to make any assumption, and I doubt he would bother to talk about programming languages, servers, and internal scripting languages to the kids that compose the 95% of the Runescape player base and the official forums. Note that, although even that would surprise me, seeing how they probably weren’t expecting to develop such a big MMORPG, runescape classic server might indeed have been programmed in java. However, even if they did, I doubt they used java for rs2. The lag in world 2, btw, is low enough, given the number of people that are in the same area. In any other MMORPG, such as WoW or SWG, the same number or people or even half of it would kill the area server.</p>
<p>While of course I have no proof of what I am saying (and I don’t even pretend to be sure that it is written in C++), there is something, besides common sense, that suggests that I am right:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Job role

    * Industry experience, including sandwich years, summer placements or freelance work.</code></pre>
<p>This text is from the jagex corporate website, in the “jobs” area. As you can see, they for the game engine programmer position, they are looking for C++ programmers as much as for java’s. Also, they welcome assembler experience, which, in java, isn’t exactly of much use. Of course, most servers nowadays are multi-tiered, so it is very possible that certain components are in C++ and others in java too.</p>

        <p>If you read, they say that experience in C, C++ OR Java is required. Any competent C or C++ programmer can pick up Java with a snap of the fingers, so this doesn’t necessarily mean the server is written in C++.</p>
<p>The “Desirable” skills generally aren’t skills that are needed for the job, they just make you look better. Anyone who can efficiently solve a problem in assembler has a very organised and logical mind and in Jagex’s eyes would make a valuable addition to the team. You can’t use job requirements as proof.</p>
<p>That said, obviously nobody here works for Jagex (except Sema of course! ;)) and can’t know for sure, but personally I’d be inclined to say it’s Java. I see no reason to write the server in C/C++, there isn’t any HEAVY mathematical processing to do (well OK, there is a fair amount when you look at the big picture, but it’s not the main tasks), I hear that with Hotspot and such Java can be fairly efficient and it would just make a lot more sense businesswise to be using the same language.</p>

Now I’m sure you don’t understand what JIT compiling is, but if you could go read the definition, then you would probably evenetually come to the conclusion that it stands for “Just In Time” compiler and has something to do about converting bytecode.  The thing is, that this simple task turns the java bytecode contained in the class files into native code.  Now I’m no expert, but I’d say that java bytecode turned programatically into native code instead of being typed by a human would be MORE efficient than anything most people could code.</p>

Don’t kill me please. Joking, what’s up with you though, no need to get aggressive. Bytecode languages are less efficient than C++, and that’s a fact. If in any aspect a byte code language is more efficient, it is only because the C++ programmer didn’t make a good job. Otherwise most programs would be made in java, as it is platform independant and easier to debug, but reality shows that most are made in C++. And that’s because it’s more efficient. Proof?<br>

I suggest using PHP to write games.<br>
[/quote]<br>
so wtf are you smoking?</p>
<p>ima start with c++ i think, any more suggestions for graphics, like texturing, mapping, that kiinda stuff?[/quote]</p>
<p>There are free engines which you can use. You could use directx straight away but it’s not worth it. Personally, I like Irrlicht the most (3d engine) but Ogre3d is very good too, maybe even better. If you don’t feel confident enough to use 3d straight away, or if you aren’t too fluent with C++ yet, you can try a 2D engine first, such as Allegro. One thing though, before starting with anything it is important to know C++ well enough. Also, some useful advice would be to start low. Personally, I always started with a Pong game.</p>
<p>Now, about my lovers… First I would like to say that Java is a great language, but idealizing it does no good. Let’s face reality.</p>

<p>The facts are just where your quote ends. And you know that. If you search in google, there are hundreds of benchmarks that prove that C++ is more efficient. And if in one it isn’t, it is because the C++ programmer doesn’t know how to manage memory.</p>

<p>I know about the JIT debugger. It gets turned into native code, yes. But that means nothing. Even if your statement about humans being unable to write code more efficiently than machines was true (and it isn’t) it wouldn’t be relevant, because java code is optimized, but so is C++'s.<br>
Also, in reality, the higher level a language is, the slower it is. Assembler (if you’re good enough) is faster than C, C is faster than C++, C++ is faster than Java. For proof, refer to the links I posted earlier or look for any unbiased benchmark table. You are right, however, that many people using a lower level language wouldn’t write faster code, because they don’t understand that language properly or because they don’t know how to optimize.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s true that it is easy to make a server in java. And in Visual Basic too, for that matter. Also, you shouldn’t worry about my education, you should worry more about yours. I don’t even see what you are trying to tell me when you say that top sites are written in java. A site is, for me, a webpage. There are webpages with java applets, of course, after all that’s what java excels with. But what does that have to do with anything? Also, why do you say google is written in java? or other sites? For what I know, google, the search engine, doesn’t even have a java applet. Seeing how you are saying that top sites are written with Java, I suppose you are mistaking Java with JavaScript, which is a complete different thing and isn’t even a programming, but an scripting language.</p>
<p>Finally, some facts, if you don’t believe them, check them yourself.<br>
-Apache, the most popular web server, is written in ANSI C for compatibility and efficiency.<br>
-World of Warcraft server is written in C++.<br>
-StarWars Galaxies server is written in C++.<br>
-Everquest server is written in C++.<br>
-Everquest 2 server is written in C++.<br>
-Half Life / Counter strike dedicated servers are written in C++.<br>
-Quake 4 dedicated servers are written in C++.<br>
-Diablo 2 servers are written in C++.<br>
(…)</p>
<p>In fact, I don’t know of any single professional server for any game that is programmed in java. You can argue and say that that JIT is god, but in that fact is the reality. No professional company writes game servers in java, and much less MMORPG servers, because it would be a waste of money. Also, if anyone is curious as to how I know these servers are written in java, in the case of dedicated servers, they are available for download. In the case for MMORPG servers, you can check that the only jobs they offer for java programmers, is as a web designer. You can also check that any game or systems related job requires C++.</p>
<p>Edit: I don’t even know why I am wasting time about this…</p>
