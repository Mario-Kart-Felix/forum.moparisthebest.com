    <description>I&#39;m not a big fan of EA. But i love Battlefield 2, its just something that I love to sit down and play after a stressful day.

Anyways(u guys notice i say this nearly every paragraph) to the point: I installed 
Battlefield 2 [Disk]
then
Battlefield 2 : Special Forces [Disk]
then
Battlefield 2 : Euro Force [EA downloader]
finally
Battlefield 2 : Armored Fury [EA downloader]

As you can see I have 2 disks, then ordered the other two online (I bought them ages ago)

Next I remember that I put in the invalid CD key (Ok aimbots don&#39;t get me anywhere, i found that out nearly two years ago) luckily a special friend gave me an old cd key generously. So i thought ok: I&#39;ll uninstall everything and re install it all just to make sure its all ok.

Now I managed to install the first two games which are on disk... then I get to the downloaded ones, there is nowhere where you can click &quot;Un-install&quot;. Even if I boot up battlefield and try to play a map from the Downloaded addons, they appear but when you click them I get the message &quot;You must have bought and installed this map to play it&quot;.

I decided to completely remove all files from the EA downloader and start download the files again, both of them are about 700mb.
Once they downloaded they just said &quot;Installed&quot; so that shows they are already installed.

I&#39;ve looked everywhere for a way to &quot;Un isntall&quot; the addons, but i can&#39;t find it anywhere.

So finally I come to mopars hoping a passer by can help me out.

Thanks in advance guys.</description>

'Cause that was a new CD Key &lt;33</p>
<p>BTW, you have to call EA’s tech support to have them activate Euro Force and Armored Fury, cause the online activation doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Also, the reason that you can’t “Uninstall” EU and AF, is because it merges it with Regular BF (remember these are boosters, not expansion packs)</p>
