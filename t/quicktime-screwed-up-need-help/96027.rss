    <title>QuickTime screwed up. Need help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quicktime-screwed-up-need-help/96027</link>
    <description>Ok so I don&#39;t know how or why, but something is wrong with my QuickTime.  I tried opening iTunes and it gave me an error report.  So I tried to open a few other things, and I noticed that the only things that don&#39;t work were the ones that use QuickTime.

It won&#39;t let me delete it, and it gives me some error when I try to install it again.


Here is the error that pops up when I go on a site that requires QuickTime.

Any help is greatly appreciated.  It is giving me a lot of trouble.[br][size=1]Posted on: May 16, 2007, 06:18:21 PM[/size][hr]Sorry for double post, but I really can&#39;t figure this out and need some help badly.</description>

              <p>Ok so the reason it wasn’t letting me remove the program before was because something was still using it.  So I went into task manager and ended everything I thought was using it.  This time when I tried to remove it, it went further than before, but some error popped up and I guess it couldn’t fully remove it.</p>
<p>I went on Apple and reinstalled it, but still same problem.  And I’m pretty sure its not Firefox or IE because they both come up with that plugin error.  And there would be no reason for iTunes and other programs not to work is FF and IE were messed up.</p>
<p>Any more ideas?</p>
