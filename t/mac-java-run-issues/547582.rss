    <title>Mac - java run issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mac-java-run-issues/547582</link>
    <description>not sure what happened. it used to work. not quite sure what I&#39;ve done since it stopped working as i haven&#39;t noticed it until now.

i can&#39;t play any java applications in web browsers. web start won&#39;t load either.

runescape applet will say &quot;java blocked for this web page&quot; i will click allow, and it will be a black screen for quite some time. then i will get the alert asking to trust the certificates or whatever. then the game will attempt to load, then it will also result in an error_game_crash

private servers will do the same, except they will remain black screened after i trust the certificate.

downloaded applets (private servers, not all applets) will open to the dock, then close after a few seconds.




im not sure why java is broken on certain things - works perfectly fine with osbuddy/runeagent/eclipse/minecraft/etc</description>

              <p>It seems that 8u25 is working with most applications but not all. The loading time for web applets is still extremely slow. Not sure if this is something that can be fixed or not.</p>

Basically yeah lol.<br>
To be honest, it seems like there’s a conflict of security permissions.<br>
Have you tried running a desktop .jar using a .sh file and seeing it it printed any exception?</p>

Yeah in update 1.7 they changed the default from “high” to “medium”, in 1.8, they removed medium.<br>
I read a few comments on oracles website, seems they’re having some trouble with 7u71/72 and 8u25.<br>
It also said something about "Java PSU releases should only be used if you are being impacted by one of the additional bugs fixed in that version."<br>
7u72 is the PSU version, perhaps that may have a fix for your current issue?</p>

              <p>What’s your current Java version?<br>
The later versions of Java 1.8 changed some security settings :L<br>
They removed the “medium” option in the security panel, making it so “high” is your default. And that doesn’t allow self signed (any RSPS basically, not RuneScape tho) apps to run without adding an exception to your website filter list.<br>
Of course, if you’re running the jar on your desktop, the security shouldn’t be an issue.</p>
