    <title>Need Help With Forms - A bit advanced?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-forms-a-bit-advanced/4383</link>
    <description>Okay, im makin a script that is going to be pretty complex but extremely user-friendly.

Anyways, im going to have one form that constantly stays up beside the RS window. It will have several labeled buttons on it. Now, i want it to be so that when you click one of the buttons on the main form, it will take you to another specified form(im gonna end up having like 9 different forms....).

So, how do i make it switch to another form when you click a button, and then i need to make it go back to the original form when you click a button ( i will have a back button in the bottom left).

Here is a straight forward explanation

1- Main Menu Form
2- Click Button &#39;A&#39; on main menu form
3- Form &#39;A&#39; pops up
4- Click &#39;Back&#39; Button on Form &#39;A&#39; which takes you back to main menu form

              <p>I think what you do is set up two forms, Form A and Form B. Then in your buttonclick procedure for Form A, initialize Form B procedure. That way, when you click that button on A, it should bring up B.</p>
