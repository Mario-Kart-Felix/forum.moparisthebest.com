    <title>[REQ] Nature Rune Crafter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-nature-rune-crafter/9667</link>
    <description>Please do not direct me to the one on Sythe. I have read through that topic and have found it&#39;s a ScarScape script, and worse, is outdated.

What I&#39;m looking for is something that works with the normal SCAR program (203 of course), and makes use of a Nature Tiara (which I have). Combined with a Rune Essence Miner, it has the potential to make mega-cash!

So anyway, one Nat Crafter script please. :cool:</description>
