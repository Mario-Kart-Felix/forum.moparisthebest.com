[size=18pt][b]Introduction[/b][/size]
[b]This is a pointless project that now one will care about.
My brother is a huge fan of those survival programs like bear grylls, less strout ect...
And he asked my if I could create a kinda survival like game from an rsps base.
I directly decided to give it a shot,
at least it&#39;s something original and challenging.[/b]


[img]http://f.images.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/14660949.jpg[/img]

[size=18pt][b]The project[/b][/size]
[b]I decided to use my own base of &quot;Utopia&quot; which is based of spades-scape.
But it&#39;s not an rsps, so I made some big changes (see bottom topic).
The client I am using is pbscape, slightly edited.
Generally the game is going to be what you expect from survival.
The player starts in the dessert south of al kahrid,
Prayer and magic is already removed, since it&#39;s not needed. I replaced the prayer orb with a water drop.
The player can chose between a few difficulty levels to start, he also gets a starter survival kit with needs to survive.
The player starts with a value of water and food, which decreases all the time and needs to be filled to not die.
Tasks have been done to keep the player busy, when all the tasks in an area are done you can rest in a city and move on
to a new survival area. 
The decreasing of water will depend on the temperature of the area.
Also you will get poisoned for a small period of time when you don&#39;t cook your water.
I&#39;m also thinking of spawning death animal bodies, for when the player has an urgent need of food but which will poison you.
Building a shelter could decrease the need for water (lower temperature) but that would mean i&#39;m going to have to throw myself on construction,
and that is going to be a fail.

[i]So this ^ is generally my main idea atm. I already did some stuff for it.[/i][/b][/center]

is going to move to the orb ^
still thinking where to put hunger o.o

[img]http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg109/scaled.php?server=109&amp;filename=show1z.png&amp;res=medium[/img]



[size=18pt][b]What has been done already[/b][/size]
[b]- Full repackaging
- Cleaned EVERY class from unneeded content
- All prayer and 75% magic content removed
- Client class from 700 to 210kb atm
- Added some basic survival actions
- Added difficulty system base
- Added starter survival kits based on difficulty
- Removed partly prayer and mage sprites from the client
- Worked on the deatstages, food/thirst/dead by an animal/...
- nothing that I can think off right now...[/b]


[i]Credits: [/i]
spades-scape and delta for the absolute base
me
pbscape for the client


[size=12pt]Note1: Not sure if this belongs in this section, but since it&#39;s coming from an rsps base, looking like one, programmed like one, and partly is like one I guess it fits here.
note2: I don&#39;t give a flying fuck about haters on this, I&#39;m doing this for myself and my brother. I didn&#39;t think about showing it off anyways, but thought it might support people to do some more original stuff instead of the 100th server who claims to be awesome just because it has torva.
[/size]


A look in in my packaging, Suggestions on better titling is always welcome, seems that I kinda suck at that.
