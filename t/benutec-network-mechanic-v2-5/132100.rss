BOOST your LAN/Internet Speed! 
Network Mechanic optimizes your Internet connection, providing faster download speeds and fewer delays while browsing. It acts as an accelerator for your network connection.

Such parameters as packet size, receive and transmit window sizes, the number and size of buffers used usually are adjusted by the qualified experts. Now with the help of our program you can optimize TCP/IP protocol according to your opportunities of network without a studying all bases TCP/IP networks. 

Key Features in Network Mechanic 
:: Optimizes TCP/IP protocol
:: Erases Firefox Cache
:: Erases Internet Explorer Cache
:: Erases Opera Cache
:: Erases America Online Cache
:: Enhancements for Outlook Express
:: Enhancements for Internet Explorer 

How Network Mechanic does it? 
Network Mechanic asks you to provide some simple information about your networking, and uses that information to analyze your system. It then adjusts your network setup to maximize your Internet (Web) performance. And unlike programs such as TweakDUN and InternetBoost, it safely modifies your low-level TCP/IP settings without forcing you to understand a bunch of network jargon.

What does Network Mechanic actually do? 
Netowork Mechanic modifies a wide series of parameters that control how your TCP/IP stack operates. Depending on your operating system and the selection you make for how you use your PC it selects the parameters to change and what appropriate values for those parameters should be. A partial list of parameters it examines and (may) adjust includes: Default Time To Live, Maximum Transmission Unit, Black Hole Router detection, Keep Alive Intervals, Initial Large Buffer Count, Medium Buffer Count, Small Buffer Count, Default Receive Window, Default Send Window, Large Buffer Size, Medium Buffer Size, and others. The values chosen will vary depending on your operating system and the type of network setup you have.
