    <title>Client freezes in bank?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-freezes-in-bank/396467</link>
    <description>So on my old computer (32bit) i could sscroll endlessly in my bank without any problems. now for some reason on my current computer (64bit) it freezes when i get about 10-12 lines down. i think it&#39;s the models that are installed to the client. but idk. i cant really check without it freezing.
The weirdest thing is i didn&#39;t change anything but the jdk version when i changed computers. this actually is the client i took from the old one (literally stole it off the hard drive)</description>
