    <title>Higher webclient revisions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/higher-webclient-revisions/539616</link>
    <description>I feel that as the private servers are moving well up into the 700+ there should be more available revisions to choose from for the top list pages, including web clients available for them. I understand past concerns about conflict with Jagex over having revisions that are too close to runescape&#39;s, but I feel that now with RuneScape headed into RS3 it&#39;s safe to work with client revisions in the 600s at least. Just something to throw out there for consideration, I think it&#39;d be a nice feature and bring more traffic to Mopar. Not to mention how simple an addition it would be. What does everyone else think?</description>
