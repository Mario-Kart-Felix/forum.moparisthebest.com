[b][u]What am I looking for:[/u][/b]

I am looking for another two server programmers to work on the base, one to two programmers to make the website and a few content programmers. I also could use people to get information if you would like to apply for this send me a pm and we can talk :)

[b][u]The base:[/u][/b]

The base is design by me from the ground up.

The base currently has the following done:


[ul][li]Cache loading[/li]
[li]Object definitions loading via cache[/li]
[li]Maps loading via cache[/li]
[li]Clipping loading (Walking and projectile)[/li]
[li]Pathfinding[/li]
[li]Content system[/li]
[li]Combat system[/li]
[li]Action system[/li][/ul]


and much more.

[b][u]Application:[/u][/b]

Note: If you apply you must have a good understand of java or php.

&lt;blockquote&gt;How old are you?:
Skype name:
Position:
How long have you coded?:
Can you show me some previous work?:
What time zone are you in?:
How long will you be on everyday?:
Why do you want to become part of this server?:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b][u]The current team:[/u][/b]


[ul][li]X-Logic - Paul [Server Programmer / Leader][/li]
[li]Wizard Jesse - Jesse [Content Programmer][/li][/ul]


Thanks,
X-logic.</description>

Excuse me sir, in your application you refer to the word “coded” as a synonym for “programmed”.  As a professional programmer, that is very newbie.  You have 24 hours to change the verb to “programmed”, or we will be forced to find you and kill you.<br>
