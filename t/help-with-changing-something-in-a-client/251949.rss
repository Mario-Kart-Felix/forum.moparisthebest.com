<p>You need to set your path to the bin folder of your version of JDK.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">@echo off
"C:\program files\java\jdk1.6.0.##\bin\javac.exe" *.java
pause</code></pre>
<p>That’s what your compiler should look like. Change the <span class="hashtag">#s</span> to the version you have.<br>
You can find out what version of JDK you have by going to your java folder in program files and looking at the numbers in the folder name.<br>
If you don’t have a folder named JDK, google it and download it from sun’s website.</p>
