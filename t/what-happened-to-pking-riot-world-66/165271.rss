    <title>What Happened to Pking Riot World 66</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-happened-to-pking-riot-world-66/165271</link>
    <description>The Pay to Pk Riot (also known as the World 66 Riot) was a that took place in Falador square, World 66, in December 2007. It was a response to the following updates:

    * Wilderness Changes, Bounty Hunter and Clan Wars!
    * Trade and Drop Changes
    * RuneScape vs Real-world Trading 

During the later half of 2007, Jagex had been making many updates to control the macroing and real world trading problems. Updates such as the movement of the Party Room, Lootshare, the Grand Exchange, the assist system, the addition of new random events, and the changes at the Duel Arena had all been designed to stop macroers and real world traders, while at the same time giving players alternative methods of playing that were intended not to hinder gameplay. However, many players felt these update did in fact hurt gameplay.

The tension had been growing, with an increasing anti-Jagex air beginning to surround the forums. When the Behind the Scenes for December was released, some players feared that the removal of the Wilderness would occur, although these were general dismissed as unlikely. Tension was growing greatly between players. On December 10th, Jagex released the updates listed above.

<p>They could have.  But they didn’t.  They conceded and slowly made changes that would ruin SS (in-applet world switching, the Grand Exchange, clan chat, etc.).  I’d like them to do that with PKing.  Keep the fun, but somehow rule out RWT by some other means than utterly removing PKing.</p>

              <p>The Pay to Pk Riot (also known as the World 66 Riot) was a that took place in Falador square, World 66, in December 2007. It was a response to the following updates:</p>
<pre><code>* Wilderness Changes, Bounty Hunter and Clan Wars!
* Trade and Drop Changes
* RuneScape vs Real-world Trading 
</code></pre>
<p>During the later half of 2007, Jagex had been making many updates to control the macroing and real world trading problems. Updates such as the movement of the Party Room, Lootshare, the Grand Exchange, the assist system, the addition of new random events, and the changes at the Duel Arena had all been designed to stop macroers and real world traders, while at the same time giving players alternative methods of playing that were intended not to hinder gameplay. However, many players felt these update did in fact hurt gameplay.</p>
<p>The tension had been growing, with an increasing anti-Jagex air beginning to surround the forums. When the Behind the Scenes for December was released, some players feared that the removal of the Wilderness would occur, although these were general dismissed as unlikely. Tension was growing greatly between players. On December 10th, Jagex released the updates listed above.</p>
