    <title>New idea that poped in my head</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-idea-that-poped-in-my-head/533834</link>
    <description>Now I know after I tell you guys this idea you might go create it yourself and sell it, but honestly if I can think of this simple tweek, I can probably think of something else  :|.

The idea poped in my head when I was thinking of sci-fi movies like star trek and communication on their arms.  Yes I was going to sleep and it happen to stick with me since I think its a great idea, so I would like some feedback on it and not sure if something is already in dev or has been created like this.  Its simple its basicaly you talking to your squadron , yes I was thinking about military purposes for this, or your base camp on a mission so here how it works.

So as you see there are 2 buttons,a speaker(where you talk), and on the back a scanner.

Scanner: The scanner basically scans your suit out. Think of it like this, you are given a code like 786, so your suit is 786.  So when you leave the base, sent out from, will scan out your suit and then your communications will be linked to your base where you left and linked to your squadron.  That is what the two buttons are for.

Button(B): This button once press you will be connected to the base you where signed out of and will be able to talk to them.

Button(S): This button has you connected to your squadron and has you communicate with them for your mission.

Button(S)+Button(B): By pressing both of the buttons you will be communicating to a emergency type hotline, secret base not sure on what it will be, if everything goes haywire.

*note pressing a button is only for switching back and forth between channels, default is button(S).

Speakers: Now depending if you have a helmet that is built in the suit has a headset so you can hear better, but if not the speaker will speak out the respondent.  Also it allows you to speak if you move your arm towards your mouth..like a sensor type thing.



Now that&#39;s my idea and not sure if it will work, but in my head it sounds fantastic lol.  I know they have stuff somewhat better but this looks way cooler to have ;D</description>
