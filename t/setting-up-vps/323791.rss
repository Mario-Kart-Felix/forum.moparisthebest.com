    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-up-vps/323791</link>
    <description>Hello this is Your Master, today im going to make a tutorial how setup and VPS.

Difficulty: It&#39;s not that hard, so I would say 2/10


Description: Alot of people have been posting this, so finally i decided to make tutorial.


Tutorial:

Ok the first is, going to start [IMG]http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt277/Your-Death/tut1.jpg[/img]

Then go to Accessories and press on Remote Desktop Connection. Mine is Danish, not English. [IMG]http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt277/Your-Death/tut2.jpg[/img]

Now type in your local-ipadress. It can be found when you go in Start&gt;Run or Start&gt;CMD typing ipconfig and like this should pop-up, type that IP marked in the image. [IMG]http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt277/Your-Death/tut6.jpg[/img]
Now when you typed the IP then do not connect, go to options then press on Experience and do like in the picture. [IMG]http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt277/Your-Death/tut4.jpg[/img]
When you did all the things above, you can connect. When you press connect, a little pop-up box will come and will look like this. [IMG]http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt277/Your-Death/tut5.jpg[/img] Write in your username and pass, then connect and whola you got your VPS.
If you dont understand this or having problems, then there is an video how to do it at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7-oadqBRzM
