        <p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:20, topic:478819‚Äù]You can still make an editor export SQL statements instead of directly connecting to the MySQL server if you wanted to. Also if the data is completely unchanging, why use JSON? Use a binary format or something if it doesn‚Äôt matter. I don‚Äôt agree that it‚Äôs unchanging though because the point of this editor is to make changing the data even easier.[/quote]You wouldn‚Äôt be able to edit your current settings‚Ä¶ All you could do is add new ones.</p>
<p>Also, it‚Äôs unchanging while the server is online. It is also rarely changed period. Also, I never said you shouldn‚Äôt use a binary format‚Ä¶ The only issue with that is setting it up, which is going to be the biggest pain in the ass out of all of them.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:20, topic:478819‚Äù][quote=CodeForFame]<br>
Is it easier to use with a web front-end? Nope.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Writing published website databases if the data is in MySQL or another database is a lot easier and more efficient with MySQL. Think allowing people to see where objects are located on a website. Even think dynamically inserting objects from the game. Yes it‚Äôs possible with XML, but a lot easier with a database.[/quote]I‚Äôm not talking about XML‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm talking about JSON. Also, dynamic content, on the client side, is much harder to do with MySQL compared to JSON. You either have to give the data when the page loads or use something to get the data. JSON was made specifically to go with JavaScript. With MySQL, you‚Äôll have to create the same classes that are already written in Java, again in JavaScript. Again, a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:20, topic:478819‚Äù][quote=CodeForFame]Is it easier to write an editor for and would it be better? Hell no.[/quote]It‚Äôs just as easy.[/quote]No it‚Äôs not. Have to create all the queries instead of just using code that‚Äôs already out there. You have to connect to a database, and hope it‚Äôs online for it to even work. You have to parse the result sets and create objects with them, essentially create codecs.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:20, topic:478819‚Äù]EDIT:<br>
Keep in mind storing it in a database doesn‚Äôt always mean MySQL. If for some reason you wanted to use JSON for it, something like MongoDB or CouchDB would give the best of both worlds allowing JSON exports, indexing and efficient querying from a website or anything else for that matter.</p>
<p>The rest of the points you brought up are irrelevant. Small speed increases don‚Äôt matter and won‚Äôt make a difference for startup code.[/quote]I‚Äôm talking about any SQL database, both of those are NoSQL databases.</p>
<p>Overhead is not an irrelevant issue‚Ä¶ Switching from XML to JSON took about 200MB off the memory footprint of the gameserver. Running a SQL server isn‚Äôt negligible overhead; MySQL uses a shitload of resources.</p>
<p>Ease of switching is a huge point‚Ä¶ Creating an optimized binary format for each thing would take a long ass time, and I don‚Äôt think anyone in this community would be able to finish it. Switching to MySQL will take <span class="bbcode-i">at least</span> the better part of a day and is extremely tedious. Switching to JSON takes less than an hour, and would take almost no time at all seeing it was already done and the code is open-source.</p>

Inserting things dynamically into either is still a pain in the ass.
<p>It would be a little more effort to convert a JavaScript object to a query, but it would only take one method of string concatenation to do it. Fetching it wouldn‚Äôt take any effort if something with dynamic hash -&gt; JSON conversion was used. For example in PHP, if you use a query to select your object locations, it returns an associative array. You can easily convert that array into JSON to send to the client with a single built in function. Hardly any effort at all. The same can be done with many other languages.</p>

<blockquote>I'm talking about any SQL database, both of those are NoSQL databases.</blockquote>
Yes and I'm talking about possible alternative ways to store locations. I know they are NoSQL databases but they would still solve the same problem.
<blockquote>Running a SQL server isn't negligible overhead; MySQL uses a shitload of resources.</blockquote>
Resources that are already being used if the server is using MySQL for other things...

        <p>Well that didnt help‚Ä¶ I looked into type 1 and I thought it was interactable items because it was mainly trees, and doors then one was a long table‚Ä¶ and im like uh?.. so if anyone knows what types are what and how many they are post them here please to improve the generator thanks.</p>
<p>Edit: Nvm there are only 2 types‚Ä¶ and it determines rather its going to be this object or that object for example type 0 on a bench is a bench‚Ä¶ then type 1 on a bench turns it into a door. So Ill leave that a text field for people to figure out‚Ä¶</p>

<p>[quote=CodeForFame]I‚Äôm not talking about XML‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm talking about JSON. Also, dynamic content, on the client side, is much harder to do with MySQL compared to JSON. You either have to give the data when the page loads or use something to get the data. JSON was made specifically to go with JavaScript. With MySQL, you‚Äôll have to create the same classes that are already written in Java, again in JavaScript. Again, a pain in the ass.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Inserting things dynamically into either is still a pain in the ass.[/quote]With JSON you can just go, hey, use this file too. With MySQL it‚Äôs a lot more work.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:26, topic:478819‚Äù]It would be a little more effort to convert a JavaScript object to a query, but it would only take one method of string concatenation to do it. Fetching it wouldn‚Äôt take any effort if something with dynamic hash -&gt; JSON conversion was used. For example in PHP, if you use a query to select your object locations, it returns an associative array. You can easily convert that array into JSON to send to the client with a single built in function. Hardly any effort at all. The same can be done with many other languages.[/quote]No, creating all the objects needed is a pain in the ass and takes like an hour of painfully tedious work.</p>
<p>Also, your ‚Äòsingle method‚Äô is going to be complex and a pain in the ass to make and maintain. Creating an entire set of codecs in a single method would be terrible design.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:26, topic:478819‚Äù][quote=CodeForFame]No it‚Äôs not. Have to create all the queries instead of just using code that‚Äôs already out there. You have to connect to a database, and hope it‚Äôs online for it to even work. You have to parse the result sets and create objects with them, essentially create codecs.[/quote]You wouldn‚Äôt need to connect to the database if you were just creating an SQL export.[/quote]How do you know what you‚Äôre starting with then? How do you remove things, when you don‚Äôt know if you have them or anything about them. How do you change things when you don‚Äôt know their current state? All you can do is create an ‚Äòeditor‚Äô that adds entries.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:26, topic:478819‚Äù][quote=CodeForFame]<br>
I‚Äôm talking about any SQL database, both of those are NoSQL databases.[/quote]<br>
Yes and I‚Äôm talking about possible alternative ways to store locations. I know they are NoSQL databases but they would still solve the same problem.[/quote]You‚Äôre widening the topic to a point where it‚Äôs impossible to discuss‚Ä¶ You were arguing for MySQL and I was arguing against it.

        <blockquote>Simply adding things to a JSON file is trivial... Check out gson.</blockquote>Yes but still more effort.
<blockquote>Okay, your method only talks about getting something from the database... It doesn't cover going from a result set to an actual object that can be used, which is the entire issue...</blockquote>Easily handled by using something like an ORM if you didn't want to write a basic one for this use yourself.
<blockquote>This is not an editor... It's an xml generator. An editor would allow you to add, remove, and modify entries. Without all three the tool is pretty useless.</blockquote>Yes I agree. You'd need all 3 for a better editor and it would require connecting to the MySQL server or using some form of exported data.
<blockquote>No, you were arguing the MySQL is what should be used. Opening this up to include NoSQL makes it impossible to talk about in general terms, or to weigh pros and cons seeing nearly every NoSQL database is fundamentally different.</blockquote>I'm arguing that MySQL should be used over JSON/XML but I think using a NoSQL database which uses JSON would be a better solution than either. More specifically MongoDB.
<blockquote>No you weren't... See my last point.</blockquote>Yes I was. Before you brought up the complexity of modifying an existing server.
<blockquote>If it was never going to be modified, then JSON probably wouldn't be the best solution... A custom format would be better, and just serializing them would probably be better than using JSON. JSON is better when things are going to be changed and people are lazy, which is this community.</blockquote>Yes so "in this community" then JSON would be better in that case.

<p>REALLY guys we get it you both have points, your boh intelligent and your both trying to make an ass out of each other great, but im sick of it on my topic this topic has nothing to do with SQL so why are you guys even discussing SQL?.. Drop it who gives a love about SQL or speed i surely dont.</p>

        <p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:33, topic:478819‚Äù][quote=CodeForFame]Simply adding things to a JSON file is trivial‚Ä¶ Check out gson.[/quote]Yes but still more effort.[/quote]No it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ Add an entry to the collection and save it. It‚Äôs that simple. Using MySQL is actually more work.</p>
<p>Here is the entire code to save something (that is already written and fully functional):</p>
<p>[code]	private Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting()<br>
.excludeFieldsWithModifiers(Modifier.TRANSIENT)<br>
.generateNonExecutableJson().create();</p>
<pre><code>private &lt;T&gt; void save(File file, T data) throws Exception {
	if (!new File(file.getParent()).exists()) {
		new File(file.getParent()).mkdirs();
	}
	FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file);
	fw.write(gson.toJson(data));
	fw.close();
}
</code></pre>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs see the code to do the same using MySQL‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:33, topic:478819‚Äù][quote=CodeForFame]Okay, your method only talks about getting something from the database‚Ä¶ It doesn‚Äôt cover going from a result set to an actual object that can be used, which is the entire issue‚Ä¶[/quote]Easily handled by using something like an ORM if you didn‚Äôt want to write a basic one for this use yourself.[/quote]That‚Äôs my whole point‚Ä¶ With JSON (specifically gson) you don‚Äôt have to do that at all. Writing the code for that would take at least an hour or two, seeing there are many types to convert.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:33, topic:478819‚Äù][quote=CodeForFame]This is not an editor‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs an xml generator. An editor would allow you to add, remove, and modify entries. Without all three the tool is pretty useless.[/quote]Yes I agree. You‚Äôd need all 3 for a better editor and it would require connecting to the MySQL server or using some form of exported data.[/quote]No, you need all 3 to have an editor, otherwise it‚Äôs something else. Also, it seems like you‚Äôre shrugging this off as something that‚Äôs not an issue when it‚Äôs a major issue.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:33, topic:478819‚Äù][quote=CodeForFame]No, you were arguing the MySQL is what should be used. Opening this up to include NoSQL makes it impossible to talk about in general terms, or to weigh pros and cons seeing nearly every NoSQL database is fundamentally different.[/quote]I‚Äôm arguing that MySQL should be used over JSON/XML but I think using a NoSQL database which uses JSON would be a better solution than either. More specifically MongoDB.[/quote]I really don‚Äôt see the point of introducing the overhead of it‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt really need queries, replication, load balancing, or any of the other features that come with it.</p>
<blockquote>No you weren't... See my last point.</blockquote>Yes I was. Before you brought up the complexity of modifying an existing server.[/quote]That's not even remotely true...
See:
[quote="RSCShadow, post:14, topic:478819"]Needlessly separating them into inferior storage mediums instead of keeping everything on one system doesn't make sense.[/quote]
<p>Before I even started arguing about this, you made the assumption that MySQL is already being used. That is an assumption that can not be made because you have things like EassyRSC and MoparClassic. Neither of which needs to use MySQL and already have other ways of doing it.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúRSCShadow, post:33, topic:478819‚Äù][quote=CodeForFame]If it was never going to be modified, then JSON probably wouldn‚Äôt be the best solution‚Ä¶ A custom format would be better, and just serializing them would probably be better than using JSON. JSON is better when things are going to be changed and people are lazy, which is this community.[/quote]Yes so ‚Äúin this community‚Äù then JSON would be better in that case.[/quote]I don‚Äôt think you realize how much work creating a custom format is‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre not talking about like 5 different classes, there are nearly 40 different files that need to be converted and some of them have quite a few fields and you really can‚Äôt reuse that much from one class to another. Also, you need to account for people moving things around in classes, so you can‚Äôt really just use reflection and take the values of each field and write it. You‚Äôd have to indicate which field, but that wouldn‚Äôt be optimal because you‚Äôre storing extra info. So, you‚Äôre looking at a shit load of work to ensure that fields can be moved around (but not changed) and that it would still load correctly. There are also several other issues that can arise, which make it a lot more work.</p>
<p>Anyway, I highly doubt any community would go through the trouble to create a good custom format, that isn‚Äôt half-assed, because they‚Äôd realize it‚Äôs just too much work for pretty much no reason when you have alternatives like JSON.</p>

        <p>SQL is SQL, XML is XML they both are good depending on the person. End the conversation already‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs nothing special about neither, they both execute databases of information‚Ä¶ woopidy I work with both SQL and XML all the time and really I prefer neither they both suck IMO because I hate dealing with the shit it would be nice if you could just scroll through objects, select one and place it like the sims haha but we all know thats not ever going to happen and if it does, someone spent a lot of time on it, and it wouldnt be until the near future‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Hopefully that 3D Object viewer turns into something more, perhaps make it where you can view and place the object on the map, rotate it etc‚Ä¶that would be tight.</p>
