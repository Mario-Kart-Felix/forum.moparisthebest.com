[b]ITs2013 Object Code Generator:[/b]
ITs2013 Code generator is for the [b]ObjectLoc.XML[/b] file, it does not automatically update it that you will have to do yourself, by copying and pasting it into your XML as you would normally do. This program allows you to simply punch in digits and keep adding onto it until your ready to place the code into your XML. 

It&#39;s simple, its sweet and it&#39;s small so you don&#39;t need no more then [b]2KB[/b] of space available! 

I&#39;ve released a few versions the first one was a fail, because it only had 4 directions, the second one was alright but it wasn&#39;t super friendly... So i&#39;ve revised it one last time to make it look good, work good and understandable for all user&#39;s of the community if they have some sense of what a XML file is, and the format of XML they will understand what this program is for.

[b]How do I get it to work?[/b]

Firstly, [b]download[/b] it here: http://uppit.com/xyzw7i30966e/ITs2013_OC.rar

After you have it downloaded, extract it. This is a simple RAR, Zip file to insure everyone can extract it without having to download WinRar. Once it is extracted click on the icon it will install into your start menu, and the program will start Wala, there you have it.

Now go ahead and punch in the digits of your information that your wanting to add to the game and press generate. You can continue to generate multiple lines of code until your ready to copy and paste it into your XML file.

Thanks for viewing, downloading and your interest in my program  :)</description>

Sure, you can use Google maps with a database, but you  still have to map everything into a different format (XML/JSON).</p>

<p>Hopefully that 3D Object viewer turns into something more, perhaps make it where you can view and place the object on the map, rotate it etc…that would be tight.</p>

<p>Here is the entire code to save something (that is already written and fully functional):</p>
<p>[code]	private Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting()<br>

	}
	FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file);
	fw.write(gson.toJson(data));
	fw.close();
}
</code></pre>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>Now, let’s see the code to do the same using MySQL…</p>
<p>[quote=“RSCShadow, post:33, topic:478819”][quote=CodeForFame]Okay, your method only talks about getting something from the database… It doesn’t cover going from a result set to an actual object that can be used, which is the entire issue…[/quote]Easily handled by using something like an ORM if you didn’t want to write a basic one for this use yourself.[/quote]That’s my whole point… With JSON (specifically gson) you don’t have to do that at all. Writing the code for that would take at least an hour or two, seeing there are many types to convert.</p>
<p>[quote=“RSCShadow, post:33, topic:478819”][quote=CodeForFame]This is not an editor… It’s an xml generator. An editor would allow you to add, remove, and modify entries. Without all three the tool is pretty useless.[/quote]Yes I agree. You’d need all 3 for a better editor and it would require connecting to the MySQL server or using some form of exported data.[/quote]No, you need all 3 to have an editor, otherwise it’s something else. Also, it seems like you’re shrugging this off as something that’s not an issue when it’s a major issue.</p>
<p>[quote=“RSCShadow, post:33, topic:478819”][quote=CodeForFame]No, you were arguing the MySQL is what should be used. Opening this up to include NoSQL makes it impossible to talk about in general terms, or to weigh pros and cons seeing nearly every NoSQL database is fundamentally different.[/quote]I’m arguing that MySQL should be used over JSON/XML but I think using a NoSQL database which uses JSON would be a better solution than either. More specifically MongoDB.[/quote]I really don’t see the point of introducing the overhead of it… You don’t really need queries, replication, load balancing, or any of the other features that come with it.</p>
<blockquote>No you weren't... See my last point.</blockquote>Yes I was. Before you brought up the complexity of modifying an existing server.[/quote]That's not even remotely true...
See:
[quote="RSCShadow, post:14, topic:478819"]Needlessly separating them into inferior storage mediums instead of keeping everything on one system doesn't make sense.[/quote]
<p>Before I even started arguing about this, you made the assumption that MySQL is already being used. That is an assumption that can not be made because you have things like EassyRSC and MoparClassic. Neither of which needs to use MySQL and already have other ways of doing it.</p>
<p>[quote=“RSCShadow, post:33, topic:478819”][quote=CodeForFame]If it was never going to be modified, then JSON probably wouldn’t be the best solution… A custom format would be better, and just serializing them would probably be better than using JSON. JSON is better when things are going to be changed and people are lazy, which is this community.[/quote]Yes so “in this community” then JSON would be better in that case.[/quote]I don’t think you realize how much work creating a custom format is… We’re not talking about like 5 different classes, there are nearly 40 different files that need to be converted and some of them have quite a few fields and you really can’t reuse that much from one class to another. Also, you need to account for people moving things around in classes, so you can’t really just use reflection and take the values of each field and write it. You’d have to indicate which field, but that wouldn’t be optimal because you’re storing extra info. So, you’re looking at a shit load of work to ensure that fields can be moved around (but not changed) and that it would still load correctly. There are also several other issues that can arise, which make it a lot more work.</p>
<p>Anyway, I highly doubt any community would go through the trouble to create a good custom format, that isn’t half-assed, because they’d realize it’s just too much work for pretty much no reason when you have alternatives like JSON.</p>

I see you didn’t read what I had posted at all and didn’t provide anything to support yourself. I said it would be a bit more effort and provided a basic example of one way to approach it.
<blockquote>How do you know what you're starting with then? How do you remove things, when you don't know if you have them or anything about them. How do you change things when you don't know their current state? All you can do is create an 'editor' that adds entries.</blockquote>That's what this editor is to begin with. Regardless, if you did want to make a more complicated editor, then yes it would either have to have access to the database or you'd have to export something beforehand. Way to go.
<blockquote>You're widening the topic to a point where it's impossible to discuss... You were arguing for MySQL and I was arguing against it. Stay on subject.</blockquote>Yes I am widening it to find a better solution overall. I don't see how this makes it impossible to discuss. Maybe it's impossible for you to grasp the idea that there can be more than two solutions. I still think using a NoSQL database with JSON would solve both problems.
<blockquote>Like I said, there is no reason for the gameserver to know there was a SQL server running... For all you know the loginserver could be using flat files, JSON, XML, or whatever.</blockquote>But we know what the loginserver is using.
<p>I was originally talking about this more generally, not modifying an existing server.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’d agree with you if in this scenario the locations would not need to be used on any website, MySQL was not being used anywhere else and did not need to be modified at all. In that case using JSON over MySQL makes sense.</p>

<p>[quote=CodeForFame]I’m not talking about XML… I’m talking about JSON. Also, dynamic content, on the client side, is much harder to do with MySQL compared to JSON. You either have to give the data when the page loads or use something to get the data. JSON was made specifically to go with JavaScript. With MySQL, you’ll have to create the same classes that are already written in Java, again in JavaScript. Again, a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>[quote=“RSCShadow, post:26, topic:478819”]It would be a little more effort to convert a JavaScript object to a query, but it would only take one method of string concatenation to do it. Fetching it wouldn’t take any effort if something with dynamic hash -&gt; JSON conversion was used. For example in PHP, if you use a query to select your object locations, it returns an associative array. You can easily convert that array into JSON to send to the client with a single built in function. Hardly any effort at all. The same can be done with many other languages.[/quote]No, creating all the objects needed is a pain in the ass and takes like an hour of painfully tedious work.</p>

<p>[quote=“RSCShadow, post:26, topic:478819”][quote=CodeForFame]No it’s not. Have to create all the queries instead of just using code that’s already out there. You have to connect to a database, and hope it’s online for it to even work. You have to parse the result sets and create objects with them, essentially create codecs.[/quote]You wouldn’t need to connect to the database if you were just creating an SQL export.[/quote]How do you know what you’re starting with then?

Yes and I’m talking about possible alternative ways to store locations.
