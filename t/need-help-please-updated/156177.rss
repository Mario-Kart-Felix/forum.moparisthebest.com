              <p>First, close your internet browser as that’s the application thats most likely using it.  Note that the process could still exist even after closing it, so look in task manager as well.</p>
<p>If you still can’t delete it, have a look for a program by SysInternals (I think its owned by Microsoft now) called Process Explorer.  When you have it loaded, go to Find-&gt;Handle and search for your filename.  It will tell you exactly which process is using the file, and you can either terminate the entire process or simply close the handle referencing your file.</p>
