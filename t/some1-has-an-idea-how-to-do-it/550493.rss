    <title>Some1 has an idea how to do it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some1-has-an-idea-how-to-do-it/550493</link>
    <description>Okey so i have 2 questions :

1) About my drygores
I have been adding drygores (rapier, mace and longsword) but there is no offhand, is there a way i can change some things to make an offhand drygore?

2) About custom items
So i&#39;ve added some customs for ex. Death cape.
Atm it gives me the problem that when i spin around (the emote) the cloak just stays there. Its like not connected to my character.

If you have any idea&#39;s or wanna have a look on team viewer, feel free to add me on skype : nielskeeeeeeeen.</description>

              <p>Is there any1 possibility you would accept to show/learn me on 1 item? Like by using team viewer or so?</p>
<p>Also doesn’t the offhand drygore turns to the ground and acts like a shield? I don’t think the offhand drygore hits aswell right?</p>

<p>You would have to open the model in a program like metasequoia and move it so it’s in the other hand.</p>

<p>You need to animate the cape.</p>
