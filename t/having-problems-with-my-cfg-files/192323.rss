    <title>Having Problems with my .CFG Files</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/having-problems-with-my-cfg-files/192323</link>
    <description>Alright, so I&#39;ll just give you a brief explanation of my problem and my position that I have been for a little while now.


My .CFG files don&#39;t open.. I have no idea why, but I&#39;d like to know if I could get some help. I&#39;ll give you the story. About 2 Months back the Motherboard on my computer Broke.. I have no idea how, but it did. Luckily I had a spare computer that nobody in my family used. That was unfortunately for a reason.. It&#39;s a really old computer and runs slower than you could imagine. Alright, so back to the main problem. I downloaded the same source I was working on when I had my first computer. I restarted all of the work. What I did first was try to restore the areas that I had previously Such as Training areas, and Slayer Areas etc. When I got to the actual NPC&#39;s I noticed that my .CFG Files look like this...

Alright, and this is what happens when I try to open one of them. Here&#39;s Autospawn.CFG for example.

Alright, so that&#39;s basically it.. If you think you know why this has happened, please give me a shout. I am getting extremely frustrated due to the fact that I can&#39;t progress with coding until this is off my back. It bothers me ;)

Thanks a bunch,

              <p>When you double click it it should come up with the last pic. Well select use a program from a list. Then choose notepad. Then you can edit it. Hope that helped.</p>
