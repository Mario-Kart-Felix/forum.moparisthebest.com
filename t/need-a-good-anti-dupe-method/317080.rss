    <title>Need a good anti dupe method</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-good-anti-dupe-method/317080</link>
    <description>There has been a very bad duping problem on my server. I have a method.. but people found a new way to come around it.. originally it was the trade glitch and now it still is.. my method just deleted the trade timer to kick them out of trade. but they did a total opposite of the dupe then usual. if anyone has the method to where it will delete the items in trade. once they press accept and decline i would appreciate it.
what i mean is if a player clicks accept and decline then all items in the trade will dissappear for good. i would appreciate it a lot. and im willing to rep if possible.</description>
