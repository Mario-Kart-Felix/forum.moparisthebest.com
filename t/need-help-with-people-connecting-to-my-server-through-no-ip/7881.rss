    <title>Need help with People Connecting to my server through no-ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-people-connecting-to-my-server-through-no-ip/7881</link>
    <description>well ive been using hamachi the last couple of days, and sometimes my server goes offline, but if i restart hamachi, it works again so its nothing to do with my server. Since im behind a router, people cant connect to me through my no-ip ip i set up and i was wondering how i would beable to let people connect to me using no-ip since hamachi is playing up on me.

if thats confusing, in a nutshell this is my problem:

People currently cant connect to me directly though a no-ip IP address
I turned to Hamachi to allow people to connect
Hamachi sometimes stops working so people cant connect anymore
I want to turn back to using a no-ip IP address but i need to get it to work.


thanks in advance for anyone who can help.</description>

              <p>Let me explain this to you and im only going to explain this once so listen up!!!</p>
<p>Go to your no-ip dynamic update client you will notice it will say something like updating to NAt/ Router some thing like that there is your problem!!! now go to “options” and go to “connections” then press “over ride automatic conection detection” and then click on “adapter to use to connect to no-ip” select the hamachi network then go to “override automatic ip detection” tick it and then click on “Ip to post for updates” and select your hamachi network. You see it was set to your routers ip address by default if you dont beleive me type in your no-ip address into the address bar before you do this tutorial it should open up your router configuration and what this tutorial just did was say that your hamchi ip address = your no-ip host name and vice versa make sure you have hamachi open when you do this!!! I hope this helped!!!</p>
