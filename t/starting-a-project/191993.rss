    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-a-project/191993</link>
    <description>Ok this isn&#39;t a very organized topic but here goes
I want to start a new server and client project the server will be coded by 3people including me and 2people working on the client.

Postions needed to start
A client code(up to 2)
And server coders(up to 2)

Positions avaliable
Forum mod(up to 3)
Forum admin(just 1)
and Maybe a hoster for a second world I host my server 24/7 atm but if we have 2worlds it would be even better
And the admin must be able to use vbulletin
Last but not least SOMEONE TO INSTALL VBULLETIN MODS :)
