    <title>[delta] Fight types [delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-fight-types-delta/431670</link>
    <description>Okay in Client.Java has the GetWepAnim int and I need to know which Fight Types is for which attack style.

I am trying to correct the weapon animations, like on a scimitar when you do the Stab option you Stab and not slash. If anyone could give me the FightTypes for each option on the Weapon Style Tab that would be highly appeciated. Thanks.</description>
