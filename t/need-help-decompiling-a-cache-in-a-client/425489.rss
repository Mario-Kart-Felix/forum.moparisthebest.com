    <title>Need help decompiling a cache in a client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-decompiling-a-cache-in-a-client/425489</link>
    <description>I have permission from the owners of a server to use customs from their server but I have to decompile their cache to get the stuff. I downloaded jad decompiler but the cmd pops up real quick then disappears.
Could anyone help me please?</description>

<p>The way to achieve what you are describing is either decompile their ItemDefinition or Class8 class, get the values, copy the model, and add that data to your client, or (hopefully) if it’s packed in the cache, then you have to either decompress the cache, copy the data from obj.dat and data.dat (I believe) or, when the Items are being loaded, copy all the data during the loading process, and export it, then import it when the client starts up again.</p>
