    <title>Giving premium players more xp</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/giving-premium-players-more-xp/361324</link>
    <description>Hello i was looking in the download section for servers to get some ideas and i found this 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Premium Membership:
# 1.5x more than the normal experience of a player
# 2x the pest control points of a normal player&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and

&lt;blockquote&gt;Extreme Membership:
# 4x the chance to get a Christmas cracker drop from the Sea Troll Queen or King Black Dragon
# 4x the pest control points as a normal member
# .5x the zombie points of a normal player
# 2x the experience gained from every skill than normal members&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think its a great feature to let premium members get more xp then regular players. I just 
have no idea how, if you know how or know where a tutorial for it is then please tell me

I am using project insanity base

Thank you</description>

              <p>I ain’t touched a server in a long time, expecially the xp hitting shit… Though… I think making a simple “else if” statement for the premium variable you use, like… “member” or whatever in your hitting method will work :L</p>
<p>Edit: didnt read topic sorry, You want all skills, not just hits… Well, I could teach you a long way, but I know someone will just comment here with a shorter way and explain to me why its shorter, and I really don’t care…</p>
