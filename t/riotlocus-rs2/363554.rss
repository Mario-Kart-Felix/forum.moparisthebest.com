    <description>[center][b][size=14pt]RiotLocus RS2 - ?[/size][/b][/center]

RiotLocus RS2 isn&#39;t a old school server, nor is it a attempt to satisfy people surround me. It&#39;s for my own joy, and my own satisfaction. The combat will be rewritten, from nerly nothing. It&#39;s based of RiotScap which was released by lmc.

[b]Update Log[/b]
[code]
Written seperated classes for eating &amp; potting(Potion.java, food.java)(Making life simple)
packaged the whole server, just to make my life easier.
Upgraded the version of the Mina
Combat has been slightly rewritten
[/code]
