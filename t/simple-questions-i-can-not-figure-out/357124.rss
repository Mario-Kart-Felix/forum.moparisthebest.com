    <title>Simple questions i can not figure out</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-questions-i-can-not-figure-out/357124</link>
    <description>Okay so i have 3 things i need help with,

#1-i do not know how to make someone a donator on my server

#2-I do not know if you can or cant make a person have two rights (hidden staff+donator)

#3-I need help either portforwarding or just help getting an open port

Details of my server- 317, l33pwnzscape source (delta) [i think]

Computer/router details- Toshiba Brand (forgot model) 2 GB memory Router: Belkin router (forgot model) i also have a 2 wire that has an ethernet cable which i have hooked to my belkin to brodcast wifi (my belkin is really gay tbh)

If you can help me with these problems or one of them it would be appreciated. Thanks! ^.^</description>
