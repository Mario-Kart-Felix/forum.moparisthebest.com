    <description>- [i]Slight[/i] delay between equipping items and the inventory update.
- Equipping items cancels your current action, however does not stop the animation or other effects that were a result of your current action.
- Canceling your combat action by equipping an item, or doing ANY other action will not result in your reentering combat [u]UNLESS[/u] you have auto retaliate set.
- Mass clicking bones will [i]NOT[/i] result in you burying each. You will bury the first pressed bone.
- You can click a food item and click to bury a bone, both actions will be processed simultaneously.
- You are NOT required to be within 1 square of a NPC after a dialogue has started, they CAN and sometimes will walk away from you.
- When interacting with a tree to cut it down you will only turn to the tree after your route to the tree has finished. This still occurs even when you cancel the action by burying bones. 
- When interacting with a NPC to initiate combat, you will turn to the NPC at the start. This is canceled when you cancel the action.
- When you interaction with a target after you initiate combat, you will stop during your route to the NPC at the exact point you cancel the action.
- Facing direction for objects is variable, for some objects you will face the adjacent side, others you will face the opposite.

- Music regions are handled in blocks, the point of shifting your song [b]exactly[/b] coincides with regions (64x64). 
- Songs play IMMEDIATELY when you change regions.

Example:

3200, 3200 -&gt; Harmony
3199, 3200 -&gt; Dream
3200, 3199 -&gt; Yesteryear
3199, 3199 -&gt; Book of spells

- You receive a message &quot;I can&#39;t reach that!&quot; if at the end of your route you cannot interact with the given target. 
- You can interact with certain NPCs through certain objects, however not through other certain objects.
- The client will try and get you AS CLOSE to the NPC as possible, up to within a tile.
- When interacting with some entities the server will react not to if you are specifically interacting with that entity but rather if you are adjacent to another object, (such as a bank booth). This only works if there are no barriers between you and the adjacent object and this is MOST LIKELY signaled by the flags which designate if there are walls in that adjacent immediate direction.
- Certain objects you will walk to a specific tile and then interact with the object (not within an area).
- When using stairs you will teleport down a level on the tick you were supposed to move to a tile.

- Routing to the tile to the right will automatically route you to the center...you cannot route to the tile to the left...
- The two tiles are blocked...like in the clipping they are SET as blocked...what...
- The server will EDIT your route to the center...
- Stairs are fixed and relative to the object
- Moving after you light a fire takes priority of: left, right, down, and finally up

Bank booths are marked as penetrable so that when you interact with NPCs it checks if you have a line of sight ;)</description>

              <p>Good list, but a lot of these can be considered side effects of proper implementation of these features. To me, it’s only viable for a lot of these things to happen in an action-based server like Apollo. You’d be going out of your way in PI or Delta to make these things work.</p>
<p>Just describing the difference in difficulty required to make these things work properly, hopefully scare people into working with action/task based servers.</p>
