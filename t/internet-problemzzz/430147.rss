<p>blinking of the online light means it is working… If the link light is solid or not on then you have a problem…</p>

<p>My suggestion was more pointed towards a router… The reason I said turn the modem off is because that is what most ISP make you do… They have you turn off all connected devices to both the modem and router, then turn the router off, then turn the modem off, you then have to wait for some modems, since they use a battery to stay on when a fast power outage happens. Then they have you reconnect the devices, modem on, router on, devices connecting them on. Which should make everything work. I know that a lot of Comcast modems have an updating problem when you lose power fast, but the modem doesn’t fully shut down…</p>

Oh and also a good thing to do is complain about how it affected your work or something and say it caused your discomfort and if it has a decent customer service department they will give you a discount or something, if you make it sound like it affected something that caused inconvieniance your more likely to get a discount or something but try not to say things that costed you money as they might ask for a receipt. This isn’t just personal knowledge btw, did customer services in college as part of my course Business so this is one of the areas I know about;p.[/quote]</p>
<p>As this poster said don’t listen to them… “Rather than listening to anyone on this site”</p>
<p>Reading over the OPs post again, you can clearly tell it is a problem on his side. When a modem is set up correctly it will blink, this means it’s sending and receiving packets correctly. If the light was a solid or didn’t even turn on then you would have a problem, either being hardware or service side.</p>
<p>As I already said try restarting both your modem and router if you have one, and also check to make sure your networking device is set up correctly.</p>

              <p>It could be a problem on the ISP side, but it could also be a problem on your side, do you have a router connected to your modem?</p>
<p>If you do, I suggest you shut both the router and modem off, then restart the modem, and then start the router. The Modem will connect and should start working properly. I know when ever we lose power our modem stops working and this seems to fix it.</p>
