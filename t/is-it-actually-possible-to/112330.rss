    <description>(NOTE, BEFORE YOU READ, READ THIS):
I am not actually a hacker, autoer, I am posting this because someone hacked or messed up my server.

Anyway, onto the post...

Is it actually possible to become an admin/mod/co-owner, if you are not the owner of the server and do not have the source files?  Because thats what happened to me today.  If anyone knows any way of stopping people doing this, can you tell me, because it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to read.</description>

              <p>i have a good way of stopping this. if there making an account named “admin” and become admin, delete the admin file and make an account named admin with a pass, so noone can make it before you. you should also check your client for other names the source creator might have used. you can search through your client.java by using Ctrl+F. hope i helped.</p>

              <p>Yes i think it is possible for someone to be becoma a admin without you knowing<br>
This happened to mine, a person called <em>admin</em> logged onto my server and according to my server he was the owner i suggest doing what domo says and try and make it hack proof cause there is a greater chance that this wont happen again</p>
