    <description>[center][b][size=18pt]Welcome To The Team[/size][/b][/center]

[center][size=10pt]The team I am developing is for a 317 clean base. Everyone is welcome to who ever wants to join. I am new to the team developing. The source I currently have is old, I created it a year or so ago. I am back and want to finish what I started.[/size][/center]

[center][size=10pt]I am a little dry on my programming. We can help each other every step of the way. If your going to join the team, You need to work together and be nice. You need to be active and be on when you can. We will only work as a team, if someone doesn&#39;t want to work then we have to wait. I am a team leader.[/size][/center]

[center][size=12pt][b]About Me: My name is Ben. I am 17. I have been programming for almost 3 years now. I try my best to be online when I can. Leading the way is what I like. Team leaders and people who like to step in, is what I like. Be there to help every step.[/b][/size][/center]
