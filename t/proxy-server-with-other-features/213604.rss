    <title>Proxy Server (With Other Features)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/proxy-server-with-other-features/213604</link>
    <description>Well, I spent my free time on this small little project. Turned out to be quite nice, and I like it. Anyways, here&#39;s the scoop.

This is a proxy server (obviously written in Java), that I wrote up to learn and get used to the [i]java.nio[/i] packaged provided in the Java API. 

But the fun thing about it is that I added a few additional/bonus features.

[ul][li]Host name filter (parses and blocks names using regex)[/li]
[li]Display any page you want (I used this to display a &#39;host name blocked&#39; page and &#39;host name not found&#39; page)[/li]
[li]HTML source encoding (optional) (my favorite feature - it is also enabled when you download the JAR but by default it is disabled)[/li][/ul]


And for a list of known bugs to slow down any complaints:

[ul][li]When using the encode HTML feature, the response to the client may be slow (but it&#39;s fast enough to keep you from dieing and worth it if at work/school).[/li]
[li]When using the encode HTML feature, and if the header contains a &#39;Transfer-Encoding: chunked&#39; field, the &#39;chunked&#39; data headers in the HTML source code may be left there when the page is displayed.[/li][/ul]


The only real big downsides to this are that the encode HTML feature can be a little slow at times (seems to work very well on MSCP/MITB for some reason), and that this server is currently on a &#39;thread-per-client&#39; set up. Yes, I know it&#39;s bad. But I have no real intentions to create a huge server out of this, and using a thread-per-client set up to learn and use NIO was good enough for me at the time. 

The encoding works using JavaScript. If the client has JS disabled, the page will not display and a &lt;/noscript&gt; string will be displayed instead. It works by taking advantage of the unescape() method that comes with the version of JS. It will &#39;escape&#39; each character in the HTML source to it&#39;s hexadecimal counterpart and append a &#39;%&#39; in front of it. Using this can render any content filters that work by keyword, especially at school or at work, useless.

And of course, there are credits:

[ul][li]Zachera - Led me to a great website explaining how to encode your HTML source code. (For anybody curious about that, the link is: http://scriptasylum.com/tutorials/encdec/encode-decode.html - I also forgot to mention I ONLY added the escaping part.)[/li]
[li]Taharok - Helped me out on a few parts here and there and brought in the idea of encoding.[/li][/ul]


I&#39;ve uploaded the JAR archive (source only - you can compile it) as an attachment here. There is a total of only four classes, named Buffer, Filter, Server, and Session.

Enjoy and PLEASE leave appropriate comments/constructive criticism/other helpful tips for the future when using NIO or for any general programming purpose. The mentioning of any bugs would be great, too!

P.S. I named the archive JProxy as I couldn&#39;t think of a better one at the time. :)

P.S.S. I know MINA exists. No need for criticism on that.</description>

Yep. Thanks. How far did you end up getting, and did you use the IO or NIO package?[/quote]</p>
<p>i did it but could not find out how to get the urls, and change them to the proxy. i used IO. it didn’t have as many features as yours.</p>

<p>i generally wanted to know,</p>

since i wrote that peer-to-peer-chat program with IO, im interested in the whole networking stuff,<br>
although i used inputstream.available() so it behaves in a non-blocking way, and you can have one thread check all connections,</p>

I’m sure I won’t learn much looking through your source.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>yes you will,</p>
<p>so telenubby, did you use an already existing protocol like SOCKS5, or your own invention?<br>
also, what are the advantages or javas NIO compaired to IO?[/quote]<br>
No. Not anything of my own creation. I <span class="bbcode-i">personally</span> did not have to work with any protocol other than HTTP. Yet I still feel that question was just a dumb response regarding one or more of my previous posts. I’m not really sure to any advantages for using NIO, my guess would be the ability to work with a non-blocking socket? But I have also heard that NIO is in fact a little slower than the older IO package and it can be a little unstable/buggy at times because it is still fairly new(?).</p>
<p>[quote=“k00dr, post:11, topic:213604”]First of all, let me congratulate you. The code looks clear and stylish <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Then, here’s a few things to fix (not performance-wise…)</p>
<p>Selector.selectedKeys() is type Set, so you can use those generics properly:<br>
(you could also use the for-each loop instead of manual iteration)</p>
<p>You can set an argument final too, so you don’t need to declare a final temporary variable in order to use it in the inner class.</p>
<p>You know System.arraycopy! Why not use it?</p>
<p>Duplicate method, Buffer.getBytes(ByteBuffer) and Session.getBytes(ByteBuffer).</p>
<p>Also, you should definitely register the SocketChannels for reading and writing in the Selector, drop the one-thread-per-client model and design it well :)[/quote]<br>
Thanks for the great response, it was just what I was hoping for! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I did not notice your first suggestion (regarding the generics) when programming it the first time, as I was simply learning from examples across the net. As for your second regarding the final modifier, I did not notice that either and most likely forgot about it. The System.arraycopy() part I knew about, and did try to use it earlier. I remember getting some sort of heap space error as well, and instead of fixing it properly I was lazy and wrote my own version of it. But I know arraycopy() is native and is <span class="bbcode-i">much</span> faster than what I wrote. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I <span class="bbcode-i">did</span> know about the duplicate method getBytes(ByteBuffer) but again, I just left it how it was.
