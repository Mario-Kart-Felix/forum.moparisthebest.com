    <title>How do I log in? It tells me to make a server and I do, but it doesn&#39;t work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-log-in-it-tells-me-to-make-a-server-and-i-do-but-it-doesnt-work/167967</link>
    <description>I log in with my username and password, but then it tells me to click cancel and hit create server.  I do this, and then it says that the server was crated successfully, then I try again to log in, and it tells me to create a server, again.  Why does it do this, and why can&#39;t I log in?  

The ip thing it&#39;ll say like ##.#.##.##, do I need to change this to log in?  And if I do, can you post one I can use to just play? &gt;_&gt;
