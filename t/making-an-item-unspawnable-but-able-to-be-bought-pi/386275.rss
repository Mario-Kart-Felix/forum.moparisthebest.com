Let me explain my server. It is a spawning server and I made it so you cannot spawn the item 14484 (claws). Now, when you buy it from the shop, it says what I want it to say when you try to spawn it, &quot;This item can be earned from PK points.&quot; AND it takes your PK points. :s

I need to fix this, players are raging, I need help fast O.O</description>
