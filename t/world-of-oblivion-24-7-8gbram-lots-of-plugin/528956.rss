    <description>[b]World of Oblivion
[/b]

[b]What type of server are we[/b]
We are a server called World of Oblivion, we&#39;re a survival server with role play elements.
We started about one month ago but when we first started we were a no rules server and we got to the point where we had 20+ people online everyday out of the 30 slots and just a few plugin but the server was laggy and people were complaining so we decided to upgrade.
We upgraded to 8.2gb of ram and 160 slots and I loved the game called Oblivion so I then decided I would make my server like oblivion of course by the time i did all that we lost lots of players because we had to enforce some rules like no griefing, swearing etc.
Ok so when you first join you will start at the Imperial city you can go just outside the city and play survival if you want you can still do what ever you want in the server like killing/stealing from other players just no griefing everyones hard earned work.
Also we have lots of ranks just like in the game Oblivion the ranks are

- thief = he can picklock chest&#39;s using a gold ingot
- daedra = 
- mage =
- Warrior= 
- Bandit= 

because we have lots of ram we also have lots of plugins, I will list some of the plugin we use

- Factions
- vampire-
- iconomy
- essentials
- magica
- and lots more

So come on in and try our server out but watch out for the vampires if you get killed by one you&#39;ll become on and there is only one cure.
We also have a working Oblivion gate if you want to go to Oblivion.


If you have any suggestions please leave a comment here, thank you for reading.
