    <title>Stuck on ideas for new script?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stuck-on-ideas-for-new-script/4561</link>
    <description>hi this is for people that are stuck on ideas of what script to make some try out a script for a runes maker...
say start at bank to get the ess in the bank (put ess in first slot of the bank), have to wear a tiara of the runes you wont to make to make it faster, have it for no bank pin because when you put in your pin once you dont have to do it again do you untill logged out, set how many ess you got to tell the script to stop after all of the ess are used. 

is that ok for a discription of a good script to make?</description>

<p>Hey! That was a great script description. Infact I might give it a shot, just one problem. You posted it in the First Scripts Section <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Next time, post things similar to this in the Script Requests section =o)</p>
