    <description>[CENTER]Well i have been digging through this source for about 2 months now and decided to see if i can take it a bit further....


As afraid i am to even advertise i believe the content is a bit better than most servers out there and will only get better as we all advance and learn everyday...

Basically has done before.

A couple of features -

Choose your XP rate at anytime! - From 5000, 500 and 50 rate.

Perfect Skilling Area! - Not as unique but taking all suggestions!

A variety of bosses that will take incredible skill to master! - Oh yes i have tweaked these bad boys. 
Nex will require at least 3 people to actually enjoy life is all ill say..

Loyalty System - Nothing special! Daily Loyalty Points with a shop to spend them on! Might implement random daily rewards
and titles.

Summoning - Not 100% sure it is 100% but its very close!
Different ingredients which are found inside the two shops. Oh and universal charm drops! Lets not forget the charming imp!

Tougher Hunter! - recently tweaked, hunter NPC have been spread all around Unitykey! From the GE to the deep wild to Boss areas!

A vast variety of pking areas! - Yes of course Runescape already has Pking areas but i soon want to bring them to life! maybe even create custom ones ;) FunPK, soon to come FFA Cwars, 100% Bounty Hunter,  Ability to switch PKing on and off at a click of a button anywhere unless restricted!
, 

Unique Home! - Yes. Home is now located a couple miles from Seers Village! I plan to have this spot as a quick teleport only! 
so we may expand to the buildings around (Make it a bit more lively) because edgeville is used too much ;)

Lodestones! - No need to unlock! Fairy Rings spread all around the world and a few NPC to help you out!

Great Minigames
Single Player Pest Control! 
Custom Barrows - Will soon expand! Excepting all suggestions

80% Party Room! - Fully working chest and balloons! Great for a quick drop party or any event at all!

Bank Tabs! - Nothing big, organize your bank with ease..

X2 XP Weekends - Aside from the XP Mode
Leveling up will be a breeze if you hit it on the right time!

Open to all suggestions! - all day

New updates every week! 

Weekly events!

Staff spots open! - Prove you are worthy! I need all the help i can get

Sleek forum design! - designed by PkBro, may upgrade soon!

5+ Voting Rewards!

I love this source and am always full of ideas!
