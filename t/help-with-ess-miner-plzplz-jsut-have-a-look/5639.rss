<p>sorry mate but people dont like leechers on this forum!</p>
<p>trust me when i say that if you keep leeching and stealing peoples scripts then you will become very unpopular… take a <em>hint</em><br>
learn how to script from the very handy guides on this forum that way if you every want to cheat you dont have to look a fool to do so! (if that makes sense)</p>
<p>i havnt been on this forum for very long what so ever but i got down and dirty learning to script. (which i am still not great at) but its a working progress!</p>
