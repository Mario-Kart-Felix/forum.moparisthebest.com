    <description>Hey. i&#39;m working on an island server and it&#39;s looking pretty good so far i&#39;m going pretty well.

I&#39;m not all that experienced at coding but i&#39;ve still managed to complete most of the server without much help. But those times are over

I need help adding cooking. I&#39;ve got the range in place fishing is working but i need to be able to cook, shrimp, lobster, shark and manta ray, could anyone help me?</description>
