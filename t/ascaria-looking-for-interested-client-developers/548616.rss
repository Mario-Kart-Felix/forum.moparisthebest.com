    <title>Ascaria - Looking for interested client developers!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ascaria-looking-for-interested-client-developers/548616</link>
    <description>[center]Do [b]YOU[/b] have what it takes to be a [i]client developer[/i]?
Well, this could be your chance!

Ascaria, a 2006 custom economy server, is currently looking for interested members to join the client development team.

[SPOILER=Requirements]
There are some requirements for joining the client development team:

[ul][li]Fluent in the English language;[/li]
[li]Past experience with client developing (recommended);[/li]
[li]Large understanding of how the client works;[/li]
[li]Large understanding of java;[/li]
[li]Respect and dedication;[/li]
[li]Hard-Working[/li][/ul]

[/SPOILER]
If you meet these requirements and interested, please contact me (owner of Ascaria) via Skype. My Skype username is [b]jon.niemiec[/b] and I am usually always online!

Unfortunately, we don&#39;t have much to show for our recent client development updates, as our former client developer wasn&#39;t active enough to push updates. Luckily, we do have lots to offer on the server side of things! :)
