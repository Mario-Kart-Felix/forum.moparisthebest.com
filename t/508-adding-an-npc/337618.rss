    <description>Alright so I&#39;m new to the Runescape Development Community. I got a 508 server running. What i would like to do now is add the barrows brothers into parts of my server. However thee barrows brothers are not in my NPC List. So I was wondering how i can go about doing this? They are not listed in npclist.cfg.</description>
