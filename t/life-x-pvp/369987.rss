    <title>Life-X PvP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/life-x-pvp/369987</link>
    <description>Alright ill start off with saying, this server is an Economy based PvP server, it still needs alot of work put into it. I only have a few tasks before i let people play it, but i have alot of updates in mind for after the release to keep it intresting for the players.

Though 508 map would be unique enough.

Worked hard on adding these customs and still need to add some of them to item.cfg

These are some of the maps i&#39;ve added, i plan on adding a nietziot quest so nietziot will come in handy and im already using godwars, just need a good purpose for jatiz.

CREDITS TO DEMISE - I added this because its way more unique then adding these lame old commands and i love having whatever levels i want to pk with. You can be a pure, master, or zerker without making multiple accounts!</description>
