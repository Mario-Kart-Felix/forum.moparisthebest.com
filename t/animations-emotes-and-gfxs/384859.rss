    <title>Animations, Emotes and GFXs?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/animations-emotes-and-gfxs/384859</link>
    <description>When we refer to animations, emotes and GFXs regarding RuneScape - aren&#39;t they all the same thing?

With a few lists that I have, emotes and animations contain the same thing pretty much and GFXs begins with triple fire breath. 

So my question is how would you cateogrise(sp?) them?</description>

              <p>Wow. Now THAT makes sense! Never heard of what you just described but it painted a perfect image in my head.</p>
<p>The reason why I posted this topic is because I just released a RSPS Project Tools Package, and when I was organising the Emote, Animation and GFX list I noticed the originl authors didn’t know the difference between the 3 as they were all mixed, duplicated and scattered amongst each other.</p>
<p>I understood that graphics were painted images on the client but couldn’t get the difference between an emote and an animation, although knowing that when you create a model, you animate it, emote and animate seemed like the same thing.</p>
<p>I get it now, though. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Here. Maybe this will help you.<br>
I’ll explain some basic runescape animation data for you. Let’s start with TSKINS, VSKINS1, and PRI:. Let’s start with the easiest of the three, PRI:. PRI: stands for priorities. This is how the client knows what to show over another object. This is why sometimes items will glitch in RuneScape because either the priorities are wrong, or it is nearly impossible to get the priorities to match with every single item. Sometimes a cape will show over a plate body, or plate legs on top of a plate body. The higher the value the more it will show over top of. Like the chest piece of a armor is PRI: 3, and the platelegs are PRI:2. Next we will do VSKINS1. There is also a VSKIN2, but I don’t want to throw too much at you. :P. VSKINS is how you weight each vertice in a model. If you have ever played on a RSPS where when you walk your item glitches all up, this is because the VSKINS aren’t correct. Basically they allow animation to be set to the model. Next we have TSKINS. TSKINS are the mapping for a texture to be able to be applied to a model. You can think of it this way. You have a bone O-----O. At the end are two O’s. These stand for your VSKINS. The ------- stands for your priorities. And the TSKIN would go around the bone. Now let’s say that the O on the left’s value is 6 and the O on the right is 7. That bone cannot bend because there isn’t a weight in between it. O–O----O. This bone could move. The order of the weights would go 6, 7, 8, from left to right. Generally as you get closer to the edge of a model, the VSKIN values increase.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">PRI </span>= <span class="bbcode-b">Pri</span>orities<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">T</span>SKIN = <span class="bbcode-b">T</span>exture<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">V</span>SKIN = <span class="bbcode-b">V</span>ertex Weights (That’s why you use the wgt [weight] tool)</p>

              <p>GFX stands for Graphics, and is basically any model that is used in addition to a animation for desired effect. And GFX would be say the dragonfire shield’s special when it uses a charge. Or say the Dragon Scimitar special where there is like a red slash.</p>
<p>Emotes are any animations added to a npc. Say the character/a dragon walking. Or the motions you go through when you attack with a whip. Those are emotes.</p>
<p>Animation (If I am comprehending this correctly) is the animation data that is added to all objects and npcs in RuneScape that are animated. This is priorities, texture skins and vertex weight skins. If you want me to go into more detail about what each of these “skins” do I will.</p>
