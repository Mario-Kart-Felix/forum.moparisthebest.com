    <description>How exactly does this thing work? I have the interface broken down, and my theory at the moment is that each row is an Item Array. Not sure though, since the interface is 5x5 :/

Hm, there are more than 25 item sprites, so I’d guess a few would be gold bar smithing (into other items, e.g amulets), and blurite.</p>
<p>The array, is 5x5. Five arrays, each with five indexes. Not sure what that is. Could possibly also require you send all the items to the client, so it would contain items like Scimitars, etc.</p>

Was looking at Delta’s and the conventions were horrible. They were sending the items as sprites manually on top of each interface individually instead of using the item array. Just dl’ed PA and saw what they did. Each array is a column. :)[/quote]<br>

              <p>Well when you do the interface it is blank. So you have to send a model onto the interface, but I was wondering how the Item arrays work. Do they run in columns or rows? It also seems the ones that don’t appear 100% are child interfaces, so you can just set them to null when required to do so. Blurite doesn’t open that interface, does it? Since you can’t make blurite platebodies and such.</p>

The 1bar = Bronze &gt; Iron &gt; Steel &gt; Gold &gt; Mith &gt; Addy &gt; Rune<br>
Blurite/Elemental are in there too, not sure which though.</p>
