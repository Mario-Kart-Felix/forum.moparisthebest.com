</aside>
<p>The part when you say you need to get the work done, I’m pretty sure theres only a hand full of developers out there that can actually do what ever you ask them to do and most of them will not be applying for a development thread. I’m just trying to say theres a very high percentage you will not find someone that can not only do what ever you ask for but to also get it done on time. You might need to loosen up on that part a bit. Just putting that out there.</p>
