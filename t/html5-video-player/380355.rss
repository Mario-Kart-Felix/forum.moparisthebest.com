    <title>Html5 video player</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/html5-video-player/380355</link>
    <description>ok i have multiple video files the are part of a single video. what i want to do is give the user the option on which videos they want to view. and i want the videos to play back to back.

my idea is i will create a iframe which will be injected with the video player and info. above the video iframe will be a form that will give them options on what they want to watch; this will determine the code that is injected into the iframe. i will make some javascript that monitors the status of the video player (pause, play, stop, position) so that i can move on to the next video clip when it finishes, with as little delay as possible. the videos after the first video will autoplay.

i feel like i have forgot to mention something, but its been a long day and im ready to sleep. let me know what you think of my idea and any idea that you think would make this easier/better then mine. i plan on making it compatible with many browsers and devices.

thx.</description>
