    <title>I&#39;ve done everything and people still cannot logon to my server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ive-done-everything-and-people-still-cannot-logon-to-my-server/330333</link>
    <description>People are having trouble logging into my server and they get an error saying it&#39;s offline WHILE I have the source running. Here&#39;s everything I&#39;ve done:

I&#39;ve port forwarded 43594, this isn&#39;t hard to do since it&#39;s the only number that needs to be forwarded.
I turned off my Windows default Firewall and I&#39;ve shut off my Routers firewall.
In GUI.java I&#39;ve set SERVERIP to my hostname &quot;despairscape.servegame.com&quot; that I got through NO-IP
I&#39;ve had NO-IP Duc and I checked if the hostname had any updates, but no.
I&#39;ve ran the source and client, I&#39;m able to login but other people cannot. If someone can help me with this problem I&#39;d be very thankful. Thanks in advance.



Side Note: I&#39;m able to login with the serverip set to &quot;despairscape.servegame.com&quot; but other people can&#39;t?
When I login it says something like &quot;Connection from localhost 127.0.0.1&quot; or something alike.
What am I missing here?</description>
