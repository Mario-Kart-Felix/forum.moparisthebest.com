Okay, So I&#39;ve tried as much as I could, researched as much as I could and I just CAN&#39;T figure it out.
I&#39;m running Windows Vista, 64bit, I&#39;ve tried running clients with both the (x86) and without, I&#39;m apparently getting an error saying can&#39;t find launcher...

And I can&#39;t compile either..
