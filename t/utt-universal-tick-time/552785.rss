    <title>UTT (Universal tick time)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/utt-universal-tick-time/552785</link>
    <description>I was thinking of how possibly Jagex may store time relative to say a universal time. I know for a fact that their earlier versions of RS did not store a unix timestamp of when your farming patches may have been completed. So, I came up with this possible solution:

Take time X, this time is constant. Say July 8th, 2015 0:00:00 +0, subtract the amount of time from that point and divide by the time between ticks and you get a format which is the amount of elapsed ticks from that time that you could store in a 32 bit value for up a span of about 30 years of elapsed time. Which of course is much longer than the expected lifetime of how long the game would be available to people before having to change this format.

Would be useful for farming, couple other features. Thoughts?</description>

              <p>…yes. It’s just a unit of time relative to a constant point in time predetermined by someone. Just like a unix time stamp. The reasons for publishing the idea was to offer a perspective to people.</p>

              <p>That’s actually what I was trying to avoid. It should be simpler than that.</p>
<p>Present &gt; Past<br>
Time = Present - Past</p>
<p>I realize now that it couldn’t just save one start time for the server though. It would have to save the time for each event on the server (or overwrite the time to show a progression in an event’s stages). It wouldn’t even be necessary to save the server start time with this method.</p>
<p>ElapsedTime = ServerTime - EventTime</p>
<p>Note that this is for events that will need to outlive the server if necessary, like farming. The client would only see the ElapsedTime so it can interpret X however it wants.</p>

              <p>Yeah I can’t think of a better option that would allow you to store it server-side without losing time if the server went down.</p>
<p>You could have it store the time the server was previously started as the UTT instead of something like July 8th, 2015 0:00:00 +0. Then when the server starts again (for whatever reason it stopped), it checks the current time versus the previous start time and updates the time remaining when a related event triggers it.</p>
<p>The server sends the remaining time, measured in X, to the client before an event has completed. So 0 means that the event has completed. You could even have negative values for expired time.</p>
<p>Some benefits of this:<br>
If the server crashes it can still calculate the time elapsed.<br>
The time allowed is no longer limited so long as the server restarts every thirty years like you said.<br>
Support for expired time amounts.</p>
