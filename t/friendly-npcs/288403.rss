    <description>I have a problem here,

for some reason, i cannot attack rabbits(lvl2), dwarves(lvl17), but i can attack zombies(lvl13), i kinda figured that these must be friendly of nature, making me unable to attack.

Heres a report of what happens, 
Whatever weapon i&#39;m wielding, i click the npc, and attack it. I walk up to it, the player stops, and then nothing.
If i attack a zombie however, i either approach or stay at distance, depending on attack type, weapon type, and i start attacking.

Any ideas of how to fix this? Its really a thorn in my eye right now.
