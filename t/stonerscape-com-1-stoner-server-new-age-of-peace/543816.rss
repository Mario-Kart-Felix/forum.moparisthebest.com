    <description>Hello guys Thanks for taking your time for viewing my server, hope you Like. Let me do an introduction of myself Im Eddie(Owner Of StonerScape) I used to own a rsps called United Pkz back from 2009 and 2010 and 2011, I&#39;ll be straight with you im no specialized person in java but I love learning new things, StonerScape is about a runescape private server for the stoners:) its my little project that i&#39;m hoping to achieve big in playerbase and have myself a nice community of 50 players(dream). StonerScape went online on the 4 of June 2014, ever since that that I have been developing my server for about 2 hours a day. I started with deathlypvpz v3 becuase I love hack3r work I respect him for his source release, but theres lots of things I can rework on that source and make it grow into something big. Well pictures are below enjoy, I&#39;m not a professional developer so show respect please, If you want to teach me some stuff hit me up in-game :)
