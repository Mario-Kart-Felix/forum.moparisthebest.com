1.) At the handle, and outlining the sword, should be black, how can I get that in-game
2.) The sword is offset, and not being &quot;held in my hand&quot;.

Please help meeee!!!

Here is my Int for this weapon.

[CODE]if(i == 19960)
        {
            itemdef.modelID = 70740;
            itemdef.name = &quot;Black Demon Sword&quot;;
            itemdef.description = (new StringBuilder()).append(&quot;It&#39;s a &quot;).append(itemdef.name).toString();
            itemdef.stackable = false;
            itemdef.modelZoom = 1755;
            itemdef.modelRotation1 = 431;
            itemdef.modelRotation2 = 545;
            itemdef.modelOffset1 = -2;
            itemdef.modelOffset2 = 3;
            itemdef.anInt165 = 70740;
            itemdef.anInt200 = 70741;
            itemdef.groundActions = new String[5];
            itemdef.groundActions[2] = &quot;Take&quot;;
            itemdef.itemActions = new String[5];
            itemdef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
            itemdef.itemActions[4] = &quot;Destroy&quot;;
        }[/CODE]</description>
