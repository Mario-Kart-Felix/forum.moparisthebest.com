[size=13pt][b]Votra-Scape is a brand new 317 server that opened 4/29/15, We have a player-base of around 10 people and we hope to get many more in the future. 
We are curently in Open Beta witch means there are some bugs/glitches that need fixing. 
Mostly everything works and there are no game changing bugs that will stop you from enjoying your time on Votra-Scape.[/b][/size]

              <p>From looking at the media, it doesn’t seem like it’s going to be attracting many players any time soon. All you are showing as some shops and some feels which isn’t anything exciting which will make me want to play. I believe the advertisement is just as important as the server itself, if the advertisement is poor then people will think of your server in the same way.</p>
<p>Add more unique content, make your thread more appealing and then we can talk business. Goodluck</p>
