    <description>When I kill someone in pimpscape [my own edited server] he died but i still see him on the pile on the ground, even though on the other guys pc he is back in bank and when he is walking around in the bank he is walking through walls by the dummie place which is quite wierd.

Has anyone got a diea on how to cure this problem?

Only way i can think of is kicking when they die...But even so how do i do that?[br][size=1]Posted on: December 29, 2006, 06:57:55 PM[/size][hr]Anyone?[br][size=1]Posted on: December 29, 2006, 07:06:16 PM[/size][hr]Bump</description>
