<p>There are many. One being ease of filtering trolls and trouble makers out of our scene. Another being a deterrant for botters. There will be problems for those who are banned for autoing. Getting back in will be very difficult. My site (3hit) has a small but close community, nobody trolls each other or causes trouble. From that, they will be inviting people they know and trust, so it will branch from there meaning the foundations of the game will be from a solid community.

<p>theoretically, though I can’t see it filtering out botters/trolls when all they need to do is get invited and invite themselves multiple times. If you were around when RSCD was online, you would know it wasn’t a big success lol.<br>

I was, and it was successful. There’s probably still posts on Sythe and other forums with a bunch of people begging for an invite.[/quote]</p>
<p>If you’re trying to say that a simple invite system stopped bots and trolls, you couldn’t be more wrong. If you were even paying attention back then, you would remember this. Since you’re disagreeing, you’re obviously jumping into this just for the argument.</p>

I clearly remember the game being 100x more fun when it was invite only and ~90% of the community was from SYI. No fag trolls like you, and botting was not rampant like it was after the invitation system was removed. It was more of a closed beta where everyone was helping out and adding all the missing things.</p>

<p>Since it happened such a long time ago, you’re only remembering the good times and none of the bad. It’s kind of like losing/missing a friend; You always remember the good times. So you don’t “clearly” remember everything.<br>
You <em>try</em> and troll as well, you cannot deny that; So there were no trolls, but you were a troll. How does that work?</p>

Aslyum, I think you should gain more knowledge of the subject before posting. Your assuming… and assuming makes you look bad.[/quote]</p>
<p>I can’t even begin to understand how you think I’m assuming; I was there playing RSCD. I know what went on. If anything, you’re assuming that I’m assuming. What do we say about people assuming?</p>

<p>There are many. One being ease of filtering trolls and trouble makers out of our scene. Another being a deterrant for botters. There will be problems for those who are banned for autoing.

<p>I clearly remember the game being 100x more fun when it was invite only and ~90% of the community was from SYI.

<p>Since it happened such a long time ago, you’re only remembering the good times and none of the bad. It’s kind of like losing/missing a friend; You always remember the good times. So you don’t “clearly” remember everything.<br>
