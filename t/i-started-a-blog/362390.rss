    <description>Any idea&#39;s on the best way to make it awesome?

Only have 3 submissions as of yet, probably will be updating it every 3-5 days with a new submission. Pretty much will be adding usefull things to it that I have picked up over the years in the RSC community.

              <p>Playercount is pretty much the only con of an invite system, and it’s a big one. With an invite system we expect a slightly slow initial reaction, which will over time grow. (Which makes sense, given an invite system).</p>
<p>So we’re making sure the server is great, and stable, and run effectively and with transparent admins. We need to make sure users will stay, and then growth will occur. It will eventually get to the point where the population is almost as large as any other server would be, with a fewer number of bad seeds.</p>
<p>As long as we can hold the playerbase, I’m confident that an invite system will work. If it doesn’t I’m sure we’d be willing to adjust to make the server as enjoyable as possible.</p>

<p>The invite system would be ideal but for how long is the real question.</p>
<p>After reading your posts about the idea, I’m still not totally sure how it is going to work?</p>
<p>Is it going to be the same as previous server(s) or something completely different?</p>
<p>Would you hold your server back from showing it’s true potential to keep some nasty players out who will eventually find their way in?</p>
<p>And by potential I mean player count, seeing how that is one of the first things that comes to mind when returning to an old game like RSC.</p>

<p>I’m actually curious about why you see an invite system as something that will fail in preventing Trolls, Botters and Dicks?</p>
<p>Sure, it won’t get rid of them all, but it will substantially decrease the number of them. It’s logical, people are less inclined to invite bad seeds than they are good ones, so it acts as a filter. Sure, a few get through, but not many.</p>
<p>So, seriously, how does an invite system not work on this level?</p>

<p>Well for one, making the server invite only just for the sake of arousing interest.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s invite only for good reason. If you don’t understand it then don’t proclaim it’s for generating interest.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Out of curiosity, what is that reason?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There are many. One being ease of filtering trolls and trouble makers out of our scene. Another being a deterrant for botters. There will be problems for those who are banned for autoing. Getting back in will be very difficult. My site (3hit) has a small but close community, nobody trolls each other or causes trouble. From that, they will be inviting people they know and trust, so it will branch from there meaning the foundations of the game will be from a solid community. Any new people coming trolling and causing trouble will be dealt with through the community.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>theoretically, though I can’t see it filtering out botters/trolls when all they need to do is get invited and invite themselves multiple times. If you were around when RSCD was online, you would know it wasn’t a big success lol.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I was, and it was successful. There’s probably still posts on Sythe and other forums with a bunch of people begging for an invite.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you’re trying to say that a simple invite system stopped bots and trolls, you couldn’t be more wrong. If you were even paying attention back then, you would remember this. Since you’re disagreeing, you’re obviously jumping into this just for the argument.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I clearly remember the game being 100x more fun when it was invite only and ~90% of the community was from SYI. No fag trolls like you, and botting was not rampant like it was after the invitation system was removed. It was more of a closed beta where everyone was helping out and adding all the missing things.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Since it happened such a long time ago, you’re only remembering the good times and none of the bad. It’s kind of like losing/missing a friend; You always remember the good times. So you don’t “clearly” remember everything.<br>
You <em>try</em> and troll as well, you cannot deny that; So there were no trolls, but you were a troll. How does that work?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>~3 years ago is not that long ago… Maybe for you, since that’s almost a quarter of life.</p>
<p>I was never a troll on RSCDaemon. Trolling didn’t even become a thing until much after RSCD closed anyways. You say you were “there playing RSCD”. Who the fuck would invite your annoying ass? Or was it after invites were removed?</p>

<p>If it isn’t that long ago, then you should remember exactly how it was; Clearly you don’t.</p>
<p>Oh please, you were a wanna-be troll way back on 3rxnet. Don’t even get me started.</p>

<p>I remember pretty much exactly how it was. I know it’s more difficult for you to remember things that happened before you hit puberty, but it’s okay, your memory will development as time progresses.</p>
<p>PS - I was never on 3rxnet. RSCN/rei-net yes, but I barely posted in the beginning and considered myself a leech.<br>
