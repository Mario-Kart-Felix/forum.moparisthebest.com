    <title>Fear Factory - Request a Lock Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fear-factory-request-a-lock-please/383639</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;Mendorphins&quot;]Hey all. Some of you may have noticed my absence... I had a computer problem; good news is I&#39;m back. Bad news is I didn&#39;t have a back-up my development, so it&#39;s lost forever.[/quote]

[center]Last Update: 4th March 2011 @ 1am
[URL=http://img832.imageshack.us/i/titleboxe.png/][IMG]http://img832.imageshack.us/img83/1861/titleboxe.png[/img][/URL]

Right then, this will probably be my downfall but I&#39;m using the very client and server I downloaded that gave me a virus and cleaned my RuneScape account to make a RuneScape private server development.

It&#39;s also PI.

Now that I&#39;ve got that out of the way, it&#39;s down to business. I&#39;ve been wanting to create my own development thread for ages. I&#39;ve had a few aspirations to create a 1 Player Server, a server from scratch and a server from nothing more than a framework, but I&#39;ve realised these are far beyond me at the moment.

This may be something good or this may be something bad, depending on your personal opinion I suppose - I&#39;ll go by my own opinion and say it&#39;s something good.

[b][size=12pt][u]Progress Log[/b]

[ul]-Downloaded the source &quot;Ambitionz Forever PI&quot;.
-Deleted all malicious code.
-New starting area/mini tutorial, Gnome Hangar.
-New home, Tree Gnome Stronghold.
-Edited the &quot;Home Teleport&quot; text.
-Added the Woodcutting guild.
-Added a new drop system via the Config class.
-Added Tree spirits that drop Dragon axes as a rare drop in the Woodcutting guild.
-Added a load of trees in the Woodcutting guild.
-Tree Gnome Stronghold upstairs bank is now open.
-Added a forum for the server (see my profile for the URL).
-Customised the client.
-Added Bronze and Iron axes.
-Added axe speeds (Bronze slowest/Dragon fastest).
-Fixed a Woodcutting bug where you would still recieve XP whilst your inventory was full.
-Completely added the &quot;tutorial&quot;.
-Fixed the tutorial bugs where you would still have the &quot;Getting Started&quot; sendStatement upon completing it, and setting the side bar interface to 10 every time you clicked.
-Fixed the totalLevel bug where it displayed 9,999 extra levels for every 1 level you gained.
-Fixed the bug that respawned you in the same spot you died.
-Disabled the walking in Firemaking until I&#39;ve added a specific Firemaking Lane area (clipping every single non-walkable tile is a ridiculous task).[/ul]

[b][size=12pt][u]Current To Do List[/b]

[ul]-Fix the bug where you begin Woodcutting, walk away and still receive XP but no logs.
-Fix a client interface bug (clicking on a sprite freezes the client).section[/ul]

[b][size=12pt][u]Long Term Goals[/b]

[ul]-Delete a lot of unnecessary code.
-Fix the bug where you begin Woodcutting, walk away and still receive XP but no logs.
-Fix a client interface bug (clicking on a sprite freezes the client).
-Add a Firemaking Lane.[/ul]

[b][size=12pt][u]Features[/b]
[b][u]Woodcutting[/b]

[ul]-Bronze axe, slow, through to Dragon axe, fast.
-Tree felling, stump and re-growth.
-Woodcutting guild with every tree (including Teak, Mahogany and Hollow) except Willow (no water).
-Normal tree has 1 log whereas every other tree has randomly up to 26 logs.
-Fairly common Birds&#39; nest for a hefty supply of seeds, eggs and rings.
-If you are wielding a Bronze axe and have a Rune axe in your inventory, it will cut with the Rune axe PROVIDING you have the required level (not even RuneScape has this; it will always cut with your wielded axe).[/ul]

[b][u]Firemaking[/b]

[ul]-Firemaking Lanes (specified areas to train Firemaking with 1 step west for every log lit).
-If you light a log anywhere else you will not take a step west (to save no clipping).
-Every log obtainable is supported.
-Object creating and disappearing, creating ashes.
-99 Firemaking skillcape has the real emote and animation.
-Steady XP cocurrent to the servers general XP rate.

[i]Adding more soon...[/i]

[b][size=12pt][u]More Information[/b]

The idea behind the name &quot;Fear Factory&quot;, is that I first have to find a large building (or teleport between a few), so essentially a Factory, ran by an evil scientist who experiments and keeps a hoard of creatures all around the building (factory), so a Fear Factory. It will be the main source of monsters to kill, and you need a certain kill count for each floor and I may even incorporate the overall kill count for something else, like a ranking system in game, but I haven&#39;t quite figured that part out yet... the drops will be good too.

Although the person I downloaded the source from does not deserve any credit, I still know it&#39;s not yet a source by me.

I can assure you there is no more malicious code amongst the Java files (I checked them all, line by line). It has been deleted and I now plan to turn this whole pile of shit around in to great game-play. 

A lot of you may not agree with this but game-play is at the top of my priorities, before performance. Mainly because I have more ideas and knowledge about content than the inner-workings and framework. I will get there though, step-by-step.

I want my server to have a lot of information, whether ingame or on some forums. I won&#39;t be using commands for playerRights &lt; 3. Only I will have access to commands. The worst thing you can experience when logging on to a new server is lack of information. Every server is different, so how are you supposed to know where most things are? So I will be making sure that everything is explained clearly and easily available for the task in question.

I have an OCD that every NPC dialogue must be perfect, line for line, no gaps or straying words, that every sendMessage must use proper spelling and grammar. I strive for a professional, concise and simplistic look. If an area is interactive or in use, then everything around it should be interactive and in use. What&#39;s the point in having a lever that does nothing?

So this is a source that I&#39;ll be tidying up, adding to, editing bits, removing parts and pretty much perfecting to my standard.

I know everything you have to say about what I just wrote, stuff like:

&quot;You will never have a perfect server.&quot;
&quot;If you can&#39;t code, don&#39;t bother.&quot;
&quot;Performance is key, noob.&quot;

and that&#39;s fine, you can say these sort of things - they do not phase me. I&#39;ll be doing what I&#39;m doing and step-by-step making a game that is [i]my[/i] interprutation of fun.

You begin in the Hangar, have a quick chat with the Finacial Advisor, who has been hired by King Bolren to welcome new comers. 

Then, you can search the hangar for a few secret stashes of coins and then leave via the exit portal. 

Afterwards, you could start Agility (which is perfect by the way) or anything else you fancy.

<p>…so yeah, MySQL. I’ve decided to use the release by killamess, called No-Doze.</p>
<p>Might leave out the Fear Factory theme for the time being, I’m bored of it - I’m just going to be one of among many, trying to create a clean, classic feel to a server.</p>
<p>I do have ideas for some really original stuff, so keep your eyes out for a new Project thread within the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Months yet. After I’ve added the game play I’m going to strip it of everything else and then optimise the framework. I plan to host it though when the Fear Factory is put in properly, then run updates every week.</p>
<p>So, maybe until the end of March, but I’ll want some people to play it in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>EDIT: Updated with a couple bug fixes.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Updated a bit more.</p>

You begin in the Hangar, have a quick chat with the Finacial Advisor, who has been hired by King Bolren to welcome new comers.</p>
<p>Then, you can search the hangar for a few secret stashes of coins and then leave via the exit portal.</p>
<h2>Afterwards, you could start Agility (which is perfect by the way) or anything else you fancy.</h2>
<p>Just fishing out a few bugs (every click puts you on the log out side bar and the “Getting Started” sendStatement doesn’t clear, even on re-log).[/quote]<br>
Wow, sexy updates;<br>
When do you think this will be completed in full?</p>

You begin in the Hangar, have a quick chat with the Finacial Advisor, who has been hired by King Bolren to welcome new comers.</p>
<p>Then, you can search the hangar for a few secret stashes of coins and then leave via the exit portal.</p>
<h2>Afterwards, you could start Agility (which is perfect by the way) or anything else you fancy.</h2>
<p>Just fishing out a few bugs (every click puts you on the log out side bar and the “Getting Started” sendStatement doesn’t clear, even on re-log).</p>
