<p>(its a video)</p>
<p>So, she was 18 and was trying to protect her 3 month old son. 2 men tried to break in, one armed with a hunting knife. She called 911 and asked “if they come through this door can I shoot them?” and they said “Im not going to tell you that, but do whatever you need to do to protect your baby” so the second they opened the door she killed him with a shotgun. Police ruled the murder as justified.</p>
<p>Obviously shed either be dead or kidnapped right now, along with her son had she not shot him. Should she have only shot him in the legs? Who gives a fuck. They had a knife, which means they had some intention of something. Now if this was soviet UK, they would have come in, she would have grabbed a frying pan, they would have stabbed her or robbed her or raped her, cops would get there too late, baby could be dead, but at least the maniac living 100 miles away didnt buy a gun and go shoot up a mall.</p>
<p>And even if you pull the argument “the knife was just a scare tactic, no one had to die.” Uhh, thats retarded. If you even flash a gun or a knife to a cop they will shoot you (location depends on if it was a knife or a gun obviously). The intruders would have probably still been thrown in jail or back to doing drugs anyway so theyre better off dead.</p>

        <p>Good stuff, really good because the criminal had a knife and the person protecting herself had a gun. So all of you liberal that say we should ban guns how is this women going to defend herself against two large men with a 12 inch knife that break into her house? Next then you will be saying is we should ban knives, and even then two large men vs. one women?</p>

        <p>I don’t think anyone argues that guns aren’t a great method of defence.</p>
<p>It’s the consequences of introducing tens of millions of guns into society that people argue against. I’ve said many times, If I lived in a country like the US, I’d probably get myself a gun for defence too. If I was an American citizen, I’d fight to KEEP the right of citizens to arm themselves with guns.</p>
<p>But as a British citizen, I’d fight to keep the gun laws as they are. We’re in two entirely different situations where the problems are caused by different things.</p>

        <p>If you truly believe your life is in danger unless you take action, then yes, that is a defense for shooting somebody.</p>
<p>The difference is that in the USA you can get a gun for the purpose of self-defense, whereas in the UK you can use one if you have it for another purpose, but self-defense is not a valid reason to get a FAC.</p>
<p>However, you can show all the sob stories you like - fact is it’s a policy based on reason and facts, not emotions brought about by one individual sob story. Why isn’t your crime rate lower? Why do more people die in muggings in the US than the UK? These same questions come up every thread like this, and you can never answer them?</p>
<p>The answer is because legalising guns for self defense doesn’t do what you claim it does. You act like we’ve always been this way - handguns have only been section 5 since 1997… it’s not like we’ve never had attainable weapons.

<p>Because people don’t buy guns like they used to. The chances of running into someone with a gun is pretty low unless youre in big hunting regions.</p>

This isn’t a fucking looney toon, it was a trailer park, they would have seen her, and people aren’t that stupid.</p>
<p>That wouldn’t stop them. She even said she recognized one of them as a stalker, so they were trying to get there when she was home obviously. Not only that, it would be hard for her to get and haul her son out of there, and Im willing to bet one was keeping lookout.</p>

<p>Im not for willy nilly gun laws, I think its good the right people have them, but regulation needs to be +++, like 6 month waiting when you buy a gun etc, not 3 days.</p>

<p>If Frell’s argument was weak, then yours is weaker yet. A person walking in public with a weapon has intent to do do something, no, but a person trying to break into a house with a weapon has intent to do something, more than likely. How do you even gather that these men were thieves? The women said that she recognized one of the men as someone she had thought had been stocking her. If I had to guess a reason they were there it would be to kidnap/rape/kill or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Then you try and pull the bull shit she could have just walked out the front or back door? What the fuck do you think the thieves are doing trying to go through the fucking window to get in? The article clearly states</p>
<blockquote>As one of the men was going from door to door outside her home trying to gain entry</blockquote>
<p>They were trying to get in every door and from the looks of the video this isn’t a fucking mansion where you can just slip away without the men knowing. It looks like a fucking double wide trailer where they are going to know the minute someone trys to escape, and there are not more than 2 or 3 doors. How do you even know the lights were off and they didn’t know she was in the house? More than likely at least one or two lights were on unless this women has some special ability to get around her house in the dark and grab two guns while putting a bottle in her babies mouth.</p>
<p>Then you try and say she had complete control of the situation and was not in any danger based on the fact that SHE HAD A GUN when the sole purpose of this thread is to argue the fact of why guns should or should not be legal.</p>
<p>Your whole argument is based on your assumption that these men where thieves, that are really nice guys, and that they wouldn’t do any harm to a women.</p>

<blockquote>Sarah McKinley says that a week earlier a man named Justin Martin dropped by on the day of her husband's funeral, claiming that he was a neighbor who wanted to say hello. The 18-year-old Oklahoma City area woman did not let him into her home that day.</blockquote>
<p>what was that? the intruder she shot and killed was snooping around the house a week earlier? this set bloody red alarms ringing off in my head, a far cry from the “person she THOUGHT was stalking her”, and had it been in the video I may never have posted in this thread</p>
<p>you know what “oh, and he may have been stalking me” sounds like? it sounds like a piss poor justification and legal excuse to shoot this man once he stepped in her house, so that, mwiebelhaus, is why I thought they MAY have been thieves and not kidnapping rapist murderers</p>

<p>Then you try and say she had complete control of the situation and was not in any danger based on the fact that SHE HAD A GUN</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>and was that not the exact bloody case? she protected herself and her infant child without any danger to her life, it’s exactly what happened</p>
<p>and I’ve said this before, guns shouldn’t be legal to the general population but it is impractical and/or downright stupid to remove guns from a populace that already has them, at least while the whole issue of criminals exist</p>
<p>that is, in plain terms, making guns in the usa illegal would be a bloody nightmare and downright stupid</p>

<p>Your whole argument is based on your assumption that these men where thieves, <span class="bbcode-s">that are really nice guys, and that they wouldn’t do any harm to a women.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>my argument <span class="bbcode-i">was </span> based on the fact they were thieves, yes, but the whole “oh and they were nice guys and wouldn’t hurt a lady” is a bloody strawman and you know it</p>
<p>and finally for a fucking GEM I found in the text article: “McKinley was on the phone with 911 for a total of 21 minutes.”, the issue with this isn’t the fact someone shot and killed someone in a house and was legally allowed to do so, oh no, the issue is that the police still wasn’t able to (provide assistance to an armed robbery?(this isn’t exactly stated)) of a young mother and child AFTER 21 BLOODY MINUTES, the emergency police response time is typically 15 minutes in the uk(up from 10) at most, and it is most likely much much less than 15 minutes in any populated area</p>

<p>way to avoid his question</p>
<p>but no you can’t say the same for the attackers, you were asked why you would justify the rationally considered method of taking another persons life, also known as premeditated murder, when the situation could be avoided, when the “attackers” may not have even thought of the implications for something they didn’t even do</p>
<p>and for a bit of comic relief, I had “bear with me” a lot in the post I lost, <a href="http://www.jundooz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/bear-with-me-iphone.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">so here it is, bear with me</a></p>

<p>Are you serious?  It doesn’t say he opened the door and asked to sit down with her for crumpets and tea:</p>
<blockquote>When Martin kicked in the door and came after her with the knife, the teen mom shot and killed the 24-year-old. Police are calling the shooting justified.</blockquote>
<p>He kicked open the door and came after her with a knife, and she was supposed to try to hold him and his buddy at bay while police show up (after she already waited 21 minutes?)  You are either trolling or are completely out of your goddamned mind.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Niall</span>, you have to consider the distances and population density differences in the UK vs the US when considering police response times as well.  I think 21 minutes is a long time, but Oklahoma is very big with a very small population, who knows how far police had to drive?  Which is why people must be able to defend themselves.</p>
