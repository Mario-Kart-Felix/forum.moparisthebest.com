    <title>18 year old calls 911 before shooting intruder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/18-year-old-calls-911-before-shooting-intruder/428078</link>
    <description>This is a very interesting news report, and I think this is pretty much the best example of what the 2nd amendment is for

http://gma.yahoo.com/video/news-26797925/oklahoma-mother-18-kills-intruder-breaking-into-her-home-while-on-phone-with-911-27777235.html

(its a video)

So, she was 18 and was trying to protect her 3 month old son. 2 men tried to break in, one armed with a hunting knife. She called 911 and asked &quot;if they come through this door can I shoot them?&quot; and they said &quot;Im not going to tell you that, but do whatever you need to do to protect your baby&quot; so the second they opened the door she killed him with a shotgun. Police ruled the murder as justified.


Obviously shed either be dead or kidnapped right now, along with her son had she not shot him. Should she have only shot him in the legs? Who gives a fuck. They had a knife, which means they had some intention of something. Now if this was soviet UK, they would have come in, she would have grabbed a frying pan, they would have stabbed her or robbed her or raped her, cops would get there too late, baby could be dead, but at least the maniac living 100 miles away didnt buy a gun and go shoot up a mall.

And even if you pull the argument &quot;the knife was just a scare tactic, no one had to die.&quot; Uhh, thats retarded. If you even flash a gun or a knife to a cop they will shoot you (location depends on if it was a knife or a gun obviously). The intruders would have probably still been thrown in jail or back to doing drugs anyway so theyre better off dead.</description>

<p>Personally, while I think Budda’s example is a bit unrealistic, I do think there are better ways to deal with the situation. Like Niall suggested, leaving the house if possible is a fine example. She had 21 minutes, correct? Why keep yourself and your family in a dangerous environment?</p>

</aside>
<p>She had 21 minutes (before they kicked in the door) of them going around to all the windows and doors of the house trying to break in, how are you going to sneak away from them with a baby in that situation?  You couldn’t.</p>

<p>i’m sure they didn’t try to rape her… they just wanted to rob her house… she should of given them the chance too see how it would play out instead of taking immediate action.</p>

<p>How the hell do you have any idea what they were trying to do?  She didn’t know either.  You are saying she should have let them get within arms reach of her and her baby before trying to stop them?  That’s ridiculous.  She didn’t take ‘immediate action’, that would have been shooting through the door to kill the bastards.  She was terrified waiting for police for over 21 minutes while they tried to get in, and when they finally KICKED IN THE DOOR she shot them.</p>
<p>I said this before, I’ll say it again, someone doesn’t kick in your fucking door to sit down and have some tea and crumpets with you.  They want to hurt you obviously.</p>

<p>Actually, The house holder can still be done for murder / manslaughter, Depends on the situation and whether its deemed as threat to life, Like… if they came into your bedroom where you were sleeping i read your allowed to do somethin… But if you heard them downstairs for example… your supposed to try and get out the house and ring the police.</p>

<p>I don’t know about being robbed, but unfortunately in America being surrounded by black Americans gives you a uneasy feeling because racism is still very much alive and its a problem that will never cease to exist in America. The hatred for each other goes really deep on both sides, we just see now that the black tend to be much more racists than the whites. That’s not to say the white’s are not as equally racists (HELLO REPUBLICAN PARTY CURRENTLY IN OFFICE)</p>

But when the views opposite of what are expressed in this topic are enforced in law, why are crime rates so high?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Because most people don’t take advantage of the 2nd amendment, and when you don’t you give te criminals an upper hand. If 8 in 10 citizens had a gun crime rates would be so low.[/quote]</p>
<p>4.8 out of every 100k US citizens were intentionally murdered in 2010. 0.87 in the Netherlands. We aren’t allowed to own guns. US citizens are. So owning a gun won’t make a difference.</p>
<p>The income inequality in the US is much higher than any European country. Perhaps the fact that being poor in the US means you have to resort to crime is a great, if not the main cause of the high crime rates in the US.</p>

But when the views opposite of what are expressed in this topic are enforced in law, why are crime rates so high?<br>

Because most people don’t take advantage of the 2nd amendment, and when you don’t you give te criminals an upper hand. If 8 in 10 citizens had a gun crime rates would be so low.[/quote]I’ve said this before, but the issue of crime is always rooted in segregation between groups in society (be it ethnic, class, religious or otherwise). Minimize the segregation and you minimize the crime.</p>
