    <title>What is real?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-real/394443</link>
    <description>I find it amazing that everyone is capable of thinking. Now that may seem matter of fact, but if you think about it, and really think about it, it is crazy. They always see your face, but you never see your own. They are capable of emotions and very complex thoughts. They are thinking just how you are. 

BUT, what if they really weren&#39;t? What if everyone was a figment of your imagination, and you created their responses. That they really didn&#39;t think. They really didn&#39;t have emotions. That right now I am creating this conversation with myself, but I would never be able to tell the difference, because it is all in my mind. 

If you find that hard to concept, imagine the same thing, but everything is a dream. You wouldn&#39;t be able to tell the difference between a dream and reality.

I would like to hear your thoughts on this little thought of mine.</description>

I used to have this consept in my head that everyone was a robot, and i was the only one that real. Kind of silly, but it was a thought from when i was younger. Also, i have thought about this whole world right now, being my dream. Then one day i’ll wake up and i’m like 12 or something but then if you think deeper into it, your thoughts are proven wrong. Like for example, [shadow=red,left]how could you dream in a dream[/shadow]? How could it all be so real? How can i make sense now, but not in my dreams? If you get what i mean.<br>
[/quote]That has happened to me for real. it was odd i was dreaming in my dream that my cousin ws hitting me to wake up and then i wake up my brother was hitting me to wake up. so the moral of the story is i woke up twice :P[/quote]<br>

It’s hard to think about it without completely confusing yourself…</p>
<p>It almost makes you upset though? What if there isn’t a god? What if when we die, its nothing but blackness?</p>

<p>Nope, but when I put the sleeping part in for those who couldn’t imagine being crazy, I realized it was a lot like Inception. My first thought about this was around 1st or 2nd grade on a car ride to my grandma’s. I started wondering if my mother, who was sitting next to me, was actually thinking. I know it seems stupid, but it goes with this same topic. I didn’t think about me being crazy, I just thought maybe everyone was robots, or people with no emotions of feelings that were like a program.</p>
<p>What you say makes sense, but if you are crazy it isn’t like being blind or having a dream. You have experienced the real world, and know what it is like, but since you have a mental issue, you create this fantasy world and you imagine that you live in it. Everyone who you think that you know, are really just made up by you in this fantasy world.</p>
<p>People need to get off of the dreaming thing… it was meant to be an analogy as to what I was saying.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with a friend of mine and they pointed out something which I had never considered. This is different than landscapes, items, and people.</p>
<blockquote>If you really want to dig deep into the possibility, what about people doing things you don't know how to do. A magic trick for example. You don't understand how the trick works, so how do you create that into existence. Even if you write it off to 'magic', you wouldn't actually understand how magic worked, so how would you even go about thinking of that?
<p>When someone discusses things you do not understand, how do you project that since you don’t actually understand what they’re talking about. More so, what about when you’re being taught something you can’t quite grasp. If you are projecting everything out of your own imagination, you would have to comprehend each of those things before projecting them.</p>
<p>If you didn’t understand something it would be highly illogical, so technically to debunk your theory all you have to do is find something you don’t understand, which makes logical sense. Something you know exists for sure, but you can’t work out yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone want to disprove his contradiction?</p>

<p>Anyways, fairly generic topic on forums. It’s possible to distort others reality. Manipulation and time is the key.</p>

Let me guess, you’ve just watched inception or the truman show. I had this concept in my head a year ago for about 10 minutes and I figured out it was not possible. For example, your brain, it doens’t create anything really, it copies stuff. Everything you dream and everyone you see in your dreams, every building, every single fucking thing is something you already have seen in your real life. You don’t notice but your subconsionous records almost everything. All the fantasy you see is based on reality. Simple, no reality = no fantasy. + Our brains wouldn’t give us these type of hints if everything is created by them. (As in, a topic about this subject.)<br>
[/quote]<br>
I’ve actully had dreams where i didn’t know where i was, like i’d never seen this place before at all. You might not have had this before, but i surely have.[/quote]You don’t get it, the brain isn’t called the brain for nothing. It doesn’t just record stuff, it breaks them down to another level. For example, you could be in a world with RuneScape ground, the grass of your garden, some trees from the park, some houses that are different houses but mixed up, like the wall from one with the wall from another. Basicly it happens but the chances are small that you get into a place that is identical to an actual location. I had this  dream about nuclear food and people turning sick and into zombies, as much as I want to tell you the full dream, my foot hurts so, the location where the dream was being located I guess was like my school, but we had like a part of my kitchen in it aswell and we had an underground metro like replacing one of the buildings. I mean I had to think really hard to figure out where I was after I woke up and then it came to me that it was my school. What I’m trying to say, the fact that you saw a location it means your brain has been active in A location. People that are blind, they don’t see stuff, they DON’T imagine stuff. They imagine with sounds. Imagine that you are born blind. They have no idea what a visual is, I mean it’s like, for them it’s like 4D is not possible because you would have to see 4 sides in one viewpoint we can’t imagine that. But in theory it should be possible. The stories they get is the same for them, it’s all theories, they know it’s there but they just don’t know what it is. And because their brain never got a chance to see stuff, they can’t have visual dreams. As I said, the brain copies the environment. If there is no environment to copy, all you will see is black, in your fantasy, in reality. And so forth.</p>

according to freud, dreams have underlying meaning, so the place probably has some latent content (…if taking freudian perspective, ofc)</p>
