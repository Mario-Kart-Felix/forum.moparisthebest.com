    <title>Woodcutting works but dont get logs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/woodcutting-works-but-dont-get-logs/511147</link>
    <description>Like the title says, it works but it doesnt say like when i got a Dragon Axe it doesnt say: You need that level to use Dragon Axe and it doesnt get the Logs in inventory, it hits the tree like 5-6 times then it auto stops woodcutting and nothing really happend.

Can someone help me with this and maybe more skills? I need to add them all to my server and im not a good RSPS coder.
Help would be really appreciated.
