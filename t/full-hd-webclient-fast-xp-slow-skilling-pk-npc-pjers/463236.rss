Dude, are you rustled? No way bro you ‘implanted’ tons of content!!! I think you’re like some sort of wizard, maybe i should think twice about posting i your thread. Just a tip, people notice the little things that are extremely easy and are usually done right away like changing one word, more than these supposed ‘bugs’ that everyone is fixing now a days.</p>

<p>our server has more then that, NPCvsNPC(only tut is one i made), fully working turm (most 728s lack that.), a webclient (there is tuts but a lot have trouble getting it on cause you need to change loader.class with loader.java. I have fixed countless bugs and released them to the community, ie. the bone dropping bug, death you don’t drop anything npcs who drop stuff it doesnt show up over time for another player, working divine, working GWD with KC, all places you go to you have to run around like real runescape, obviously its a remake, (besides norm teleports.), real working qbd, the base source had some weird light matches thing and it spawns, DT us eto dc you i fixed that (no tut on that.) list go on and on… so like i said look before commenting.</p>
<p>edit : thanks for the bumps</p>
