    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/attempting-to-host-a-server/434665</link>
    <description>Hello, im currently working on a new private server called &quot;Hurtscape&quot; which i am going to be hosting again this will probably be completed and up and running in a week or so.But in the mean time i am looking for some staff members who are expierenced with helping me run the server while i am not on. On this server I Plan to have a stable economy easy money making and lots of pking also all skills will be working and new items will be added to the server and if i get enough people playing ill buy &quot;Dedicated server&quot; to make the hosting alot better. Im looking for 1 admin and 2 moderators who will be dedicated too playing and getting players on and helping them.If i do not find people that are interested in helping me this project will fail so please help me.
