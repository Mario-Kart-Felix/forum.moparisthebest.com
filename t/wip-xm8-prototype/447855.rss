    <title>[WIP] xm8 prototype</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wip-xm8-prototype/447855</link>
    <description>Hi guys, this is my 3rd model on these forums. Its untextured at the moment and the pictures here are a little outdated so some of the things you will think look wrong will have changed. I can post a dl link if anybody wants it. I decided to make this because I know how hard it is to find a decent looking model of this gun so i thought &#39;what the heck I&#39;ll make my own&#39;. Made in blender again. I will post updated pictures if I have the time. I know its nothing to do eith runescape or stuff but i want to see what you think of it, please tell me what you think of it and where i can improve.     


  Enjoy :)
