    <description>Since I see my work is being stolen on this site, I am going to post it on here also.

My name is Scu11, I&#39;m a member of rune server, I hardly go on this site, but I see some people are stealing my work and crediting others.


Video of the combat from quite a while ago: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhmAvbYb55Y

All content can be seen on this thread -&gt; [url=http://tinyurl.com/39rrugf]http://tinyurl.com/39rrugf[/url] (This links to rune server as I cannot be fucked to change all the tags to work on this site).



[url=http://uppit.com/zf9mwyhw6pz2/Rs2-Server_474.rar]UppIT - Free File hosting - google 474.rar[/url]


Also, not bothered on your comments about my code, as it&#39;s done better than the majority of this site.



[B]There are probably some bugs, as towards the end I started finding shit I&#39;d done stupidly and noting them down, never got round to fixing them though.[/B]


Credits to me, vastico, graham, sir sean, scar.


[b]You will need a 474 cache to run this. It was designed in eclipse, and works best when ran in Eclipse. I will not fix any lib errors as I did not intend for this to be a &#39;download and host&#39; server, rather a reference for people.[/b]

[b]The story[/b]

Well I sold this to Canownueasy for $500. He then added around 5hrs of content onto it, hosted it then released it under his alias, claiming that I used &quot;Thing1s 474 as a base&quot;, and that he did the majority of the work. If you compare this server to Flaresoft 474, you will see the updates to this base were minimal. Also, I did not use thing1s 474 as a base. This is based off of hyperion, written by graham. With the help of vastico, my co-dev, we converted hyperion to 474, then worked off of it. Also, Canownueasy claims it has &quot;shit combat&quot; and an &quot;awful cannon&quot; etc. You will be the judges of that. I held a public beta in which we had nearly no negative feedback. There are about 5 bugs in the entire server at max, all of them can be fixed within about 30 minutes. Would someone really pay $500 for a server with shitty combat and awful features?</description>

<p>Anyway Thing1 told me you begged him for Hyperion 474</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and you run away when I ask you questions you don’t know</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I swapped thing1 SH for hyperion 474. I did not use it, as you can see at the start of my project thread when I started from scratch. His server was shit, and I would never use it, I did however use it as a reference from some 474 packets.</p>
<p>Also, it does not have bad combat. It had about 5 bugs which were easily fixable, and even before that it was good combat (as you can test from this DL).</p>
<p>Also, you ask me stupid questions that have no relevance to my interests. You ask me about bitshifting, which I don’t care for. I don’t program anymore, yet you try to prove your superiority by asking questions such as that, even though I have no interest in programming, therefore you are proving nothing. It’s not “running away”, it’s ignoring your ignorant questions that mean nothing to me.</p>

<p>My name is Scu11, I’m a member of rune server, I hardly go on this site, but I see some people are stealing my work and crediting others.</p>

<p>Also, not bothered on your comments about my code, as it’s done better than the majority of this site.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">There are probably some bugs, as towards the end I started finding shit I’d done stupidly and noting them down, never got round to fixing them though.</span></p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">You will need a 474 cache to run this. It was designed in eclipse, and works best when ran in Eclipse. I will not fix any lib errors as I did not intend for this to be a ‘download and host’ server, rather a reference for people.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The story</span></p>
<p>Well I sold this to Canownueasy for $500. He then added around 5hrs of content onto it, hosted it then released it under his alias, claiming that I used “Thing1s 474 as a base”, and that he did the majority of the work. If you compare this server to Flaresoft 474, you will see the updates to this base were minimal. Also, I did not use thing1s 474 as a base. This is based off of hyperion, written by graham. With the help of vastico, my co-dev, we converted hyperion to 474, then worked off of it. Also, Canownueasy claims it has “shit combat” and an “awful cannon” etc. You will be the judges of that. I held a public beta in which we had nearly no negative feedback. There are about 5 bugs in the entire server at max, all of them can be fixed within about 30 minutes. Would someone really pay $500 for a server with shitty combat and awful features?<br>
[/quote]Yeah I didn’t know it had bad combat</p>
<p>Anyway Thing1 told me you begged him for Hyperion 474</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and you run away when I ask you questions you don’t know[/quote]</p>
<p>I swapped thing1 SH for hyperion 474. I did not use it, as you can see at the start of my project thread when I started from scratch. His server was shit, and I would never use it, I did however use it as a reference from some 474 packets.</p>
<p>Also, it does not have bad combat. It had about 5 bugs which were easily fixable, and even before that it was good combat (as you can test from this DL).</p>
<p>Also, you ask me stupid questions that have no relevance to my interests. You ask me about bitshifting, which I don’t care for. I don’t program anymore, yet you try to prove your superiority by asking questions such as that, even though I have no interest in programming, therefore you are proving nothing. It’s not “running away”, it’s ignoring your ignorant questions that mean nothing to me.</p>
