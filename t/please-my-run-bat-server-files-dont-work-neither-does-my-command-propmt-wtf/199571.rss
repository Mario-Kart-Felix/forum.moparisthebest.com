    <description>hey people when ever i go to like run a server or a client the command prompt thing thats supposed to come up comes up for like a second and disappears. Also when ever i go into command prompt and type a command such as [code]ipconfig[/code] it always says its not a recognized command. can someone help? would this have to do with me setting my system classpath to what my personal classpath should be? someone help!  :(



and yes this does have to do with my post about buying a laptop with Vista if you were wondering because i have been trying to figure this out for the longest time!</description>

              <p>[quote=“rosenbl, post:1, topic:270762”]You can get unlimited tech support for $7.99 per month at FC National. Just call (336) 833-4471, and ask for a trial of Package 1 technical support. If you get the voicemail, leave your email address. The trial is 7 days, and no credit card is required unless you want to order the package.</p>
<p>All of the staff at FC National are really helpful, and have a lot of technical knowledge. They also have cheaper packages, but they’re not unlimited.</p>
<p>Package 2 is $5.99 per month for 10 hours per month<br>
Package 3 is $4.99 per month for 6 hours per month</p>
<p>And they have special corporate packages for businesses, and custom packages for consumers.</p>
<p>(No, I’m not advertising. I don’t own the company. I’m just making a recommendation.)[/quote] stop friken posting that</p>
