[center][b]VanquishRSPS uses the actual NR source and has some of its Developer&#39;s on board, this truly is a legacy resumed.
[/b]
Vanquish is a brand new server based on one of the most successful private server to ever exist. The server uses the exact same source of Near Reality, with even more features added from our dedicated developers. The server has only just been released, yet has over one thousand active members and we&#39;re rapidly growing, which gives us hope that this server will soon become the number one place for Runescape Private Server fans to come and play.[/center]

[center][u]V[b]anquish is an Economy server: [/b]
[/u]
This basically means there&#39;s no spawning and any items people obtain will have been earned through PVM or from PKing. This means our items will have value, making everything more fun, giving players something to aim for and of course making it so much better when you finally get that kill for rare items. There are tons of different ways to exchange your items including specific market areas, clan chats, and even a dedicated section on forums. Being a new server we want to get our economy right the first time. To ensure we achieve this we have made drop rates at a perfect level to maintain item drops for PvMers, but also to give just enough that we&#39;re not flooded with items and massive inflation like you see on most other private servers.


[b][u]The Vanquish Experience:[/u][/b]

Vanquish&#39;s community is like no other! As soon as you join you will notice our active wilderness, active forums, and active PvMing and Clanning communities. Here at Vanquish RSPS, we don’t like to mess around, we want to bring you the players the best possible experience that we can give you. 

Our community gives a warm welcome to all new players, and presents them with many opportunity to get involded with activities and get to know existing members. We have many events and tournaments in and out of the wilderness that makes this possible. These can be anything from Clan based PKing, to a simple games of Hide and Seek. 


[u][b]The Vanquish Staff Team:[/b][/u]

All of Vanquish’s staff are hand-picked based off applications anyone is free to submit. These application then get voted on by our staff team and those few that provide the best application will get a chance to prove them selves by starting as a Server Support member. Not only do we make sure we have staff from EVERY different time zone. We make sure we have the nicest most helpful staff available for you. Many of our staff all have previous experience from other major private Server, mainly Near Reality, which means you get professional support and help when every you may need it.

[u][b]Vanquish Development &amp; Progress:[/b][/u]

The development team here at Vanquish knows quality updates have to come from what the community wants. Once you’ve become a part of the spectacular Vanquish community, you’ll notice weekly updates, with content polls that you can vote on to bring what you want and enjoy into the game. Alternatively you can put your ideas forward as suggestions on our forums and have your voice heard and see your ideas implemented if fellow players support you.

[u][b]Vanquish Forums:[/b][/u]

Not only will you notice our active forums, you’ll notice banter ranging from the PVM section to our clan discussion to even the market place, you’ll notice an uncontrollable amount of topics and giveaways which no other RSPS can provide you. Here at Vanquish we have already accumulated over 1000+ members and are still growing at a rapid and uncontrollable pace. We also have a dedicated black market section, there to provide you with all of your buying and selling needs for non-Vanquish items. These items range from anything from guides and Runescape accounts to XBOX Live.

              <p>Beta testing for Vanquish 1 and our complete make over of the server is well underway. We want this release to be perfect so we are putting a lot of time and effort into this. Expect to see everything surface very soon, 6 months of updates packed into one brand new client with a range of updates that are sure to please all types of players. We have read the communities suggestions, we have implemented the ideas that apply to us and we are now striving for perfection.</p>

<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">VanquishRSPS uses the actual NR source and has some of its Developer’s on board, this truly is a legacy resumed.<br>
</span><br>
Vanquish is a brand new server based on one of the most successful private server to ever exist. The server uses the exact same source of Near Reality, with even more features added from our dedicated developers. The server has only just been released, yet has over one thousand active members and we’re rapidly growing, which gives us hope that this server will soon become the number one place for Runescape Private Server fans to come and play.[/center]</p>

<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-u">V<span class="bbcode-b">anquish is an Economy server: </span><br>
</span><br>
This basically means there’s no spawning and any items people obtain will have been earned through PVM or from PKing. This means our items will have value, making everything more fun, giving players something to aim for and of course making it so much better when you finally get that kill for rare items. There are tons of different ways to exchange your items including specific market areas, clan chats, and even a dedicated section on forums. Being a new server we want to get our economy right the first time. To ensure we achieve this we have made drop rates at a perfect level to maintain item drops for PvMers, but also to give just enough that we’re not flooded with items and massive inflation like you see on most other private servers.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">The Vanquish Experience:</span></span></p>
<p>Vanquish’s community is like no other! As soon as you join you will notice our active wilderness, active forums, and active PvMing and Clanning communities. Here at Vanquish RSPS, we don’t like to mess around, we want to bring you the players the best possible experience that we can give you.</p>
<p>Our community gives a warm welcome to all new players, and presents them with many opportunity to get involded with activities and get to know existing members. We have many events and tournaments in and out of the wilderness that makes this possible. These can be anything from Clan based PKing, to a simple games of Hide and Seek.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">The Vanquish Staff Team:</span></span></p>
<p>All of Vanquish’s staff are hand-picked based off applications anyone is free to submit. These application then get voted on by our staff team and those few that provide the best application will get a chance to prove them selves by starting as a Server Support member. Not only do we make sure we have staff from EVERY different time zone. We make sure we have the nicest most helpful staff available for you. Many of our staff all have previous experience from other major private Server, mainly Near Reality, which means you get professional support and help when every you may need it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Vanquish Development &amp; Progress:</span></span></p>
<p>The development team here at Vanquish knows quality updates have to come from what the community wants. Once you’ve become a part of the spectacular Vanquish community, you’ll notice weekly updates, with content polls that you can vote on to bring what you want and enjoy into the game. Alternatively you can put your ideas forward as suggestions on our forums and have your voice heard and see your ideas implemented if fellow players support you.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Vanquish Forums:</span></span></p>
<p>Not only will you notice our active forums, you’ll notice banter ranging from the PVM section to our clan discussion to even the market place, you’ll notice an uncontrollable amount of topics and giveaways which no other RSPS can provide you. Here at Vanquish we have already accumulated over 1000+ members and are still growing at a rapid and uncontrollable pace. We also have a dedicated black market section, there to provide you with all of your buying and selling needs for non-Vanquish items. These items range from anything from guides and Runescape accounts to XBOX Live.</p>
