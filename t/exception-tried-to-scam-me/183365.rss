    <title>Exception tried to scam me</title>

    <description>You may not know that Exception has tried to scam me recently, i know this may be a month or so but it is recent. Here it is:

[quote=&quot;Exception&quot;]hey i saw ur post on the mopar forums about the syntax server and ur rite, rs isnt run on linux its run on a syntax server. all u hav to do is type in a special syntax command and code then u can use the syntax commands. i found the email of mod john from runescape and he told me the code but told me not to tell any1 else. but cuz u are so smart and u kno about the syntax servers i guess i could share it with u. all u have 2 do is send this to mod john and he will giv u the code

@AUTH = 0x0F8A9
@TYPE = 0x0995
@NAME = &lt;YOUR USERNAME&gt;
@UID = 0x82648282647
@PASS = &lt;YOUR PASSWORD&gt;

send that to jonny@sparkware.net, which is mod johns personal email. make sure to put in ur rs account name and pass wher it asks. its ok to send it cause mod john is jagex staff so why would they steal your account rite! they run the game they dont need to take ur account. it worked fine for me i got tons of phats and stuff now plus free members.
mod john will send u an email back with the 2 codes u need. then u type it in and the syntax server will read it in and ull be able to use ::pickup 0995 2000000 like u can on psevers.
all u have to do is go
::auth &lt;CODE #1 HERE&gt;
::msgsyntax &lt;CODE #2 HERE&gt;
then u can go
::pickup 0995 200000000
and get TONS of gp. u can also do it for phats and all the other items.
good luck  :D[/quote]
