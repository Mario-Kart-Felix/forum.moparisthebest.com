    <title>508 help. Shouldn&#39;t be hard take a look</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-help-shouldnt-be-hard-take-a-look/263954</link>
    <description> I always thought I would stick with 317s, but they&#39;re way behind runescape, and I figure people are moving away from 317s. So I&#39;ve decided to create a 508.
basically I downloaded the 508 cache from stormcutters tutorial(which I found very helpful) and extracted it into a folder I created called cache508 in the location run&gt;C:

in return... when I run the server(tonypker13&#39;s rubikscape)

I get this:

help would be very appreciated. 

If you helped me and 508s started working for me, I would try my best to do something for you such as code a BufferWriter for your not-working ipban or maybe code a command/quest w/e for new coders.

Thank you.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 22, 2009, 07:58:22 pm[/size][hr]my email is dragongegsbob@gmail.com</description>
