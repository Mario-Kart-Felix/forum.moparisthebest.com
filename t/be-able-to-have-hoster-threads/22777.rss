    <title>Be able to have hoster threads?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/be-able-to-have-hoster-threads/22777</link>
    <description>Ok , Well is it just me or is anyone else getting sick an tired of people asking for people to host their server. I mean why can&#39;t they just use there computer or find a way around it and not make a whole thread about it!!!


Moparisthebest - I think you should make a rule that you can&#39;t post... Or make a forum for it... like from main menu like a section (i.e. downloads). It might just be me but I think it is a waste of space... and has nothing to do with devlopment and help... Please consider this...

Thanks.

Others- Please vote on what you think , and comment :D

Thanks.[br][size=1]Posted at: November 06, 2006, 06:59:36 PM[/size][hr]Keep this going!!! :D I would love to stop this... it&#39;s getting out of control. I&#39;m not likeing it  :mad:</description>

<p>COMON PEOPLE. HAMACHI SUCKS! You are using peer to peer which is totally unsecure when yuo can securely run a server without stupid Hamachi. If you guys kno <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> about routers, you would know that port forwarding is only for forwarding a port on the internet directly to a computer. On a non-router computer that has internet, they will have a <span class="bbcode-u">DIRECT</span> connection to the internet. This means the server will auto-maticly run without port forwarding (only if you DONT have a router), on the internet. You may have to allow the port your running the server on through a firewall (if you have one), but hay! It is still more secure then dum stupid Hamachi!!!</p>

<p>Well everyone has there own opinion , and maybe some people aren;t so smart with computers… As you can see may people aren’t. Well anyways , I don’t really run a server anymore… So it doesnt really matter. But I am saying it’s their choice on what to do. If they can find a tut on how to port foward… And wheather there are up to it. So let them choose on their own. I mean hamachi isn’t that bad , it’s okay. But that’s my opinon.</p>
<p>So you guys choose what ever you want! :)[br][size=1]Posted at: November 06, 2006, 08:19:53 PM[/size][hr]Any other suggestions? :D[br][size=1]Posted at: November 06, 2006, 08:47:50 PM[/size][hr]Any one else?  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=9" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>
