muahaha, nice.</p>
<p>Although, your previous post said that it was impossible to travel back into time, which is false.<br>
The laws of Physics says that Time Travel is 100% possible.</p>
<p>Which is where aliens come into play. I think that aliens are humans in the future because no thing can look so similar to humans (head, eyes, mouth positioning) and they travel back into the past to abduct humans that play an important role in the future.</p>

Creation “Theory” cannot be proven, because all the evidence go against it, and lot of major fields of science renders it impossible.<br>
The soup theory can be proven by reproduce parts of it and show us that its mechanics would lead to life.</p>
<p>Could you please get some common sense.</p>

              <p>I find it silly how people go nuts thinking that religion “starts wars”. Generally speaking, wars are started for people to obtain land off others, as it will give the leaders more personal power due to the income generated from having good land. Religion doesn’t necessarily prolong wars either, mainly due to the fact that modern laws and morals have been developed from religion (such as the moral that murder is wrong) and are used in protest to end wars early (modern). Religion is more-so used to encourage people to fight [and / or] take sides, often making one side larger than the other (if one is claiming to be fighting for a larger user-base religion), often ending wars quicker (not modern) (but this feature can actually make wars bigger and last longer if the religion used is the same-size).</p>
<p>– My response to a person saying that “religion is bad because it starts all of the wars”. I personally am not religious (I was raised to be “free to chose my religion” by my [atheist] parents, and after exploring Christianity for a year or so, I moved straight to atheism. PS: This post really has no meaning, but it’s a nice read (I guess).</p>

<p>Exactly. I have faith that it is true but there is no way for me to prove it. The same applies to Primordial Soup.</p>

I just cannot grasp the thought of a god, I do not understand why people believe that somone or something is controlling everyone and everything.

<p>Ever seen that episode of family guy where stewy goes back in time with his time machine to fuck with brian?<br>
basically he goes back in time and creates the big bang with his time machine that creates the universe which created him thus making it a contradicting paradox, perhaps the same is true for somebody in the future whos yet to be born?! mind fuck</p>
