    <title>Combat Rework Idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/combat-rework-idea/543362</link>
    <description>I am sort of &quot;borrowing&quot; this idea from Dragon Age but I think it&#39;s a pretty cool idea for a rsps wanted to get your thoughts.

Melee:
-2hander of course, runecrafting plays a big role here cause you can craft runes. These runes depending on your runecrafting level have different effects such as a fire rune may add a certain % of extra damage of a certain  fire element,  there may be a body  rune that enables  body weaknesses/armor protection.
-Duelist/dual wielding, same perception but you would focus the runes  to  be more so  for movement  speed and such, and again it totally is determined by your levels.
-shield warrior ( weapon and shield ) same as the above versions.

-depending on the armor the more  fatigue or  heavy your  equipment is the slower you attack, but the more protection you have.

-Spells:
-I haven&#39;t thought of a way yet to add like the entropy spell category but...

-Things such as fire elementalist could have an  advantage over an  ice  elementalist, a combination of logs/and bars  make  up  the  type of  staff you have and the tier level. You could even  craft  runes for a melee  2hnader that did fire damage for example


Other thoughts:
-I never liked how runescape you could  get 1,000&#39;s of  fish and cook it like that. Food should be  rare so somehow  change the  economy but keep it  efficient as well. I guess ideally pking would be rather different on a server that had these concepts.
-a rogue class seems interesting to make but I am not sure I would want to use the  same concepts as Dragon Age fully for it. 

Skills: 
-Fishing ( partially discussed above ) 
-Mining/Woodcutting ( discussed above ) 
-firemaking would be the only to cook your food on the server I think would be best. Cause you are &quot;travelers&quot; anyway. You don&#39;t have the luxury of going home to a range so to speak.
-Fletching, just like the  Dalish elves make great bows on Dragon Age, I think fletching would be a great  aset cause it allows you the  possibility to craft a better higher tier staff/bow, the more higher tier, the more  items  required to make it.
-Crafting same as fletching but for armor ( light/medium ) 
-Smithing ( for making the bars for fletching and such, and also for making  Heavy armor, I think Massive armor would be like too hard to stabilize in the  economy so I am not sure how that would  be added into a server.</description>

              <p>Yeah, in Dragon Age ( well at least to my current knowledge ) the way weapons work is that they all have their different stats of course, but speed wise they are different.</p>
<p>I.e. a warhammer is a 2h weapon, just like a 2h sword is a 2h weapon. They re slower to attack with however have increased critical hit possibility and chance to crush frozen enemies.</p>
<p>i.e. a dagger is used more so by a rogue as it has backstab which allows more penalties and critical chances if you are coming from behind the dagger is also a faster weapon to attack with but like the best dagger I have personally seen was like 9.80 and that was uber rare versus some 2h that go intot he early 20’s easily.</p>
<p>there aren’t many scimitars in Dragon Age. I believe there may be a couple and they are from the Dalish area ( ? ) They seem to have the same speed as regular one hand/main hand swords. Most of the one hand/main hand swords average about 8 damage to about 18 damage max.</p>
<p>What really helps  is the runecrafting of  rune  traces on the weapons/armors  such as if you gave a  weapon that has already been made on  fire via a mage  spell then add  three paragon fire runes you would have like… 30% fire  damage at boot to add to it which is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>To even out the combat area, you can also enchant armor to have resistance to specific types of magic, for example you can  get some  traces that  help give like 10-20% fire resistance.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Elrick discussed with me about some of this:</p>
<blockquote>[5/27/2014 11:08:11 PM] Elrick: I think that it is rather necessary to balance the weapons
[5/27/2014 11:08:36 PM] Elrick: because in rs, scimitars/longswords rule the game
[5/27/2014 11:09:01 PM] Elrick: Maces, battleaxes, and hammers are useless along with 2h and mauls
[5/27/2014 11:10:08 PM] Elrick: Imo what you need to do is make it so that dps is equal among all weapons
[5/27/2014 11:10:18 PM] Elrick: so that they are all useful and can be used in appropriate situations
[5/27/2014 11:10:32 PM] Arham Siddiqui: Balance
[5/27/2014 11:10:33 PM] Arham Siddiqui: is key
[5/27/2014 11:10:38 PM] Arham Siddiqui: But the rsps community
[5/27/2014 11:10:42 PM | Edited 11:10:44 PM] Arham Siddiqui: is not 2008
[5/27/2014 11:10:48 PM] Arham Siddiqui: where they appreciate change
[5/27/2014 11:10:59 PM] Elrick: they won't even notice if you don't mention it
[5/27/2014 11:11:04 PM] Elrick: Or if you say
[5/27/2014 11:11:15 PM] Arham Siddiqui: How would you implement it then?
[5/27/2014 11:11:35 PM] Elrick: -selection of weapons- are now as efficient as the often used swords and scimitars
[5/27/2014 11:12:32 PM] Elrick: Make Maces Crush/Pray, Warhammers Pure crush, and battleaxes Slash
[5/27/2014 11:12:58 PM] Elrick: 2h go to slash/crush equivalent
[5/27/2014 11:13:12 PM] Elrick: but we will have to figure out the timers
[5/27/2014 11:13:42 PM] Elrick: It will be easy for the ones that have the same
[5/27/2014 11:13:48 PM] Elrick: but most don't
[5/27/2014 11:14:04 PM] Elrick: 2h are slow so the damage done per blow will need to be higher
[5/27/2014 11:14:48 PM] Arham Siddiqui: would be nice
[5/27/2014 11:14:58 PM] Elrick: One idea
[5/27/2014 11:15:05 PM] Elrick: would be to guess the damage stats
[5/27/2014 11:15:20 PM] Elrick: create a monster that has... 10k hp
[5/27/2014 11:15:26 PM] Elrick: nah 50k
[5/27/2014 11:15:35 PM] Elrick: see how long it takes to kill it based on our guesses
[5/27/2014 11:15:46 PM] Elrick: and then adjust accordingly
[5/27/2014 11:15:58 PM] Elrick: But that is based on feel
[5/27/2014 11:16:17 PM] Elrick: another option would be to find the attack timers for each weapon
[5/27/2014 11:16:28 PM] Elrick: set a base damage for the fastest weapon
[5/27/2014 11:16:32 PM] Elrick: which would be the dagger
[5/27/2014 11:16:38 PM] Arham Siddiqui: yeah
[5/27/2014 11:16:39 PM] Elrick: then based on that, change the values for each
[5/27/2014 11:16:40 PM] Arham Siddiqui: more logical
[5/27/2014 11:16:42 PM] Arham Siddiqui: than a scimmy
[5/27/2014 11:19:51 PM] Elrick: so if a dagger attacks every second with a base stat of +10 stab, and scimitars are every second and a half then they will be +15
[5/27/2014 11:20:00 PM] Elrick: Does that make sense lol
[5/27/2014 11:20:34 PM] Arham Siddiqui: wat
[5/27/2014 11:20:48 PM] Elrick: damage stats on weapons
[5/27/2014 11:20:55 PM] Arham Siddiqui: oh
[5/27/2014 11:20:56 PM] Elrick: when you look at a weapon
[5/27/2014 11:21:00 PM] Elrick: it will say +15 slash
[5/27/2014 11:21:01 PM] Arham Siddiqui: yeah, it makes sense
[5/27/2014 11:21:34 PM] Elrick: But I do think we need to be practical
[5/27/2014 11:21:42 PM] Elrick: because we dont want weapons to be obsolete
[5/27/2014 11:21:48 PM] Elrick: wait nvm
[5/27/2014 11:21:54 PM] Elrick: cuz you can poison daggers
[5/27/2014 11:22:16 PM] Elrick: I need to rethink this one sec
[5/27/2014 11:23:00 PM] Elrick: Ok. Because you will do less attacks per battle with longer timed weapons, I think we may want to buff them up compared to faster weapons
[5/27/2014 11:23:08 PM] Elrick: because if we balnced everything even
[5/27/2014 11:23:11 PM] Elrick: you could just choose a dagger
[5/27/2014 11:23:25 PM] Elrick: which you will have more chances to accurately do damage
[5/27/2014 11:23:30 PM] Elrick: rather than miss
[5/27/2014 11:23:36 PM] Arham Siddiqui: why the hell
[5/27/2014 11:23:39 PM] Arham Siddiqui: do people pay people
[5/27/2014 11:23:41 PM] Arham Siddiqui: to do homework
[5/27/2014 11:23:45 PM] Arham Siddiqui: ik its random
[5/27/2014 11:23:46 PM] Elrick: laziness
[5/27/2014 11:23:47 PM] Arham Siddiqui: but yeah
[5/27/2014 11:23:48 PM] Arham Siddiqui: lmao
[5/27/2014 11:24:00 PM] Elrick: but they will more than likely be the people who fail out of school
[5/27/2014 11:24:02 PM] Arham Siddiqui: id rather get a 0 than pay money
[5/27/2014 11:24:15 PM] Elrick: and work at Olive Garden with their dream job being a bar tender.
[5/27/2014 11:24:20 PM] Elrick: bartender?
[5/27/2014 11:24:22 PM] Elrick: idk if that is one word
[5/27/2014 11:24:28 PM] Arham Siddiqui: 1 word
[5/27/2014 11:24:33 PM] Elrick: anywho
[5/27/2014 11:36:37 PM] Elrick: scimitars are actually faster than longswords
[5/27/2014 11:36:43 PM] Elrick: which I think is stupid
[5/27/2014 11:59:16 PM] Elrick: assuming they are all the same stats from OSRS
[5/27/2014 11:59:22 PM] Elrick: Bronze Dagger
+4 Stab +2 Slash 2.4 sec
<p>Bronze Shortsword<br>
+2 Stab + 4 Slash 2.4 sec</p>
<p>Bronze Longsword<br>
+7 Stab +4 Slash 3.0 sec</p>

<p>The potion part is pretty much how Dragon Age does it, they have these pultices(potions ) so you drink them and you regain some health. There are also mana ( willpower for mages to cast spells ) There are stamina pots too ( for people like  dual wielding people who use a lot of special attacks …even though I may keep  special attacks out as a recovery pot in other words I never liked the concept personally.</p>
