        <p>I am sort of “borrowing” this idea from Dragon Age but I think it’s a pretty cool idea for a rsps wanted to get your thoughts.</p>
<p>Melee:<br>
-2hander of course, runecrafting plays a big role here cause you can craft runes. These runes depending on your runecrafting level have different effects such as a fire rune may add a certain % of extra damage of a certain  fire element,  there may be a body  rune that enables  body weaknesses/armor protection.<br>
-Duelist/dual wielding, same perception but you would focus the runes  to  be more so  for movement  speed and such, and again it totally is determined by your levels.<br>
-shield warrior ( weapon and shield ) same as the above versions.</p>
<p>-depending on the armor the more  fatigue or  heavy your  equipment is the slower you attack, but the more protection you have.</p>
<p>-Spells:<br>
-I haven’t thought of a way yet to add like the entropy spell category but…</p>
<p>-Things such as fire elementalist could have an  advantage over an  ice  elementalist, a combination of logs/and bars  make  up  the  type of  staff you have and the tier level. You could even  craft  runes for a melee  2hnader that did fire damage for example</p>
<p>Other thoughts:<br>
-I never liked how runescape you could  get 1,000’s of  fish and cook it like that. Food should be  rare so somehow  change the  economy but keep it  efficient as well. I guess ideally pking would be rather different on a server that had these concepts.<br>
-a rogue class seems interesting to make but I am not sure I would want to use the  same concepts as Dragon Age fully for it.</p>
<p>Skills:<br>
-Fishing ( partially discussed above )<br>
-Mining/Woodcutting ( discussed above )<br>
-firemaking would be the only to cook your food on the server I think would be best. Cause you are “travelers” anyway. You don’t have the luxury of going home to a range so to speak.<br>
-Fletching, just like the  Dalish elves make great bows on Dragon Age, I think fletching would be a great  aset cause it allows you the  possibility to craft a better higher tier staff/bow, the more higher tier, the more  items  required to make it.<br>
-Crafting same as fletching but for armor ( light/medium )<br>
-Smithing ( for making the bars for fletching and such, and also for making  Heavy armor, I think Massive armor would be like too hard to stabilize in the  economy so I am not sure how that would  be added into a server.</p>

        <p>Making food hard to obtain while keeping it as the primary source of healing makes things very difficult in terms of training. Unless you planned to hike exp rates when battling monsters to combat the lack of ability to “grind” exp for levels, this would make xp rates worse than regular rs.</p>
<p>Now, if you used a hunger scenario and turned the primary form of healing into potions made by herblore and created ways to buff your character by adding enchants to armours and spell buffs to increase defence ratings, that would be pretty damn cool.</p>
<p>Enchanting armours can be used for a variety of things, not just adding health amounts. Increased damages on specific weapons, damage buffers of different source, and much more could be added. I think Skyrim’s enchanting system, combined with WoW’s idea of breaking down already enchanted equipment into basically “Enchanting essence” would make for a spectacular Runescape system.</p>

<p>The potion part is pretty much how Dragon Age does it, they have these pultices(potions ) so you drink them and you regain some health. There are also mana ( willpower for mages to cast spells ) There are stamina pots too ( for people like  dual wielding people who use a lot of special attacks …even though I may keep  special attacks out as a recovery pot in other words I never liked the concept personally.</p>

        <p>Elrick discussed with me about some of this:</p>
<blockquote>[5/27/2014 11:08:11 PM] Elrick: I think that it is rather necessary to balance the weapons
[5/27/2014 11:08:36 PM] Elrick: because in rs, scimitars/longswords rule the game
[5/27/2014 11:09:01 PM] Elrick: Maces, battleaxes, and hammers are useless along with 2h and mauls
[5/27/2014 11:10:08 PM] Elrick: Imo what you need to do is make it so that dps is equal among all weapons
[5/27/2014 11:10:18 PM] Elrick: so that they are all useful and can be used in appropriate situations
[5/27/2014 11:10:32 PM] Arham Siddiqui: Balance
[5/27/2014 11:10:33 PM] Arham Siddiqui: is key
[5/27/2014 11:10:38 PM] Arham Siddiqui: But the rsps community
[5/27/2014 11:10:42 PM | Edited 11:10:44 PM] Arham Siddiqui: is not 2008
[5/27/2014 11:10:48 PM] Arham Siddiqui: where they appreciate change
[5/27/2014 11:10:59 PM] Elrick: they won't even notice if you don't mention it
[5/27/2014 11:11:04 PM] Elrick: Or if you say
[5/27/2014 11:11:15 PM] Arham Siddiqui: How would you implement it then?
[5/27/2014 11:11:35 PM] Elrick: -selection of weapons- are now as efficient as the often used swords and scimitars
[5/27/2014 11:12:32 PM] Elrick: Make Maces Crush/Pray, Warhammers Pure crush, and battleaxes Slash
[5/27/2014 11:12:58 PM] Elrick: 2h go to slash/crush equivalent
[5/27/2014 11:13:12 PM] Elrick: but we will have to figure out the timers
[5/27/2014 11:13:42 PM] Elrick: It will be easy for the ones that have the same
[5/27/2014 11:13:48 PM] Elrick: but most don't
[5/27/2014 11:14:04 PM] Elrick: 2h are slow so the damage done per blow will need to be higher
[5/27/2014 11:14:48 PM] Arham Siddiqui: would be nice
[5/27/2014 11:14:58 PM] Elrick: One idea
[5/27/2014 11:15:05 PM] Elrick: would be to guess the damage stats
[5/27/2014 11:15:20 PM] Elrick: create a monster that has... 10k hp
[5/27/2014 11:15:26 PM] Elrick: nah 50k
[5/27/2014 11:15:35 PM] Elrick: see how long it takes to kill it based on our guesses
[5/27/2014 11:15:46 PM] Elrick: and then adjust accordingly
[5/27/2014 11:15:58 PM] Elrick: But that is based on feel
[5/27/2014 11:16:17 PM] Elrick: another option would be to find the attack timers for each weapon
[5/27/2014 11:16:28 PM] Elrick: set a base damage for the fastest weapon
[5/27/2014 11:16:32 PM] Elrick: which would be the dagger
[5/27/2014 11:16:38 PM] Arham Siddiqui: yeah
[5/27/2014 11:16:39 PM] Elrick: then based on that, change the values for each
[5/27/2014 11:16:40 PM] Arham Siddiqui: more logical
[5/27/2014 11:16:42 PM] Arham Siddiqui: than a scimmy
[5/27/2014 11:19:51 PM] Elrick: so if a dagger attacks every second with a base stat of +10 stab, and scimitars are every second and a half then they will be +15
[5/27/2014 11:20:00 PM] Elrick: Does that make sense lol
[5/27/2014 11:20:34 PM] Arham Siddiqui: wat
[5/27/2014 11:20:48 PM] Elrick: damage stats on weapons
[5/27/2014 11:20:55 PM] Arham Siddiqui: oh
[5/27/2014 11:20:56 PM] Elrick: when you look at a weapon
[5/27/2014 11:21:00 PM] Elrick: it will say +15 slash
[5/27/2014 11:21:01 PM] Arham Siddiqui: yeah, it makes sense
[5/27/2014 11:21:34 PM] Elrick: But I do think we need to be practical
[5/27/2014 11:21:42 PM] Elrick: because we dont want weapons to be obsolete
[5/27/2014 11:21:48 PM] Elrick: wait nvm
[5/27/2014 11:21:54 PM] Elrick: cuz you can poison daggers
[5/27/2014 11:22:16 PM] Elrick: I need to rethink this one sec
[5/27/2014 11:23:00 PM] Elrick: Ok. Because you will do less attacks per battle with longer timed weapons, I think we may want to buff them up compared to faster weapons
[5/27/2014 11:23:08 PM] Elrick: because if we balnced everything even
[5/27/2014 11:23:11 PM] Elrick: you could just choose a dagger

        <p>Yeah, in Dragon Age ( well at least to my current knowledge ) the way weapons work is that they all have their different stats of course, but speed wise they are different.</p>
<p>I.e. a warhammer is a 2h weapon, just like a 2h sword is a 2h weapon. They re slower to attack with however have increased critical hit possibility and chance to crush frozen enemies.</p>
<p>i.e. a dagger is used more so by a rogue as it has backstab which allows more penalties and critical chances if you are coming from behind the dagger is also a faster weapon to attack with but like the best dagger I have personally seen was like 9.80 and that was uber rare versus some 2h that go intot he early 20’s easily.</p>
<p>there aren’t many scimitars in Dragon Age. I believe there may be a couple and they are from the Dalish area ( ? ) They seem to have the same speed as regular one hand/main hand swords. Most of the one hand/main hand swords average about 8 damage to about 18 damage max.</p>
<p>What really helps  is the runecrafting of  rune  traces on the weapons/armors  such as if you gave a  weapon that has already been made on  fire via a mage  spell then add  three paragon fire runes you would have like… 30% fire  damage at boot to add to it which is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>To even out the combat area, you can also enchant armor to have resistance to specific types of magic, for example you can  get some  traces that  help give like 10-20% fire resistance.</p>
