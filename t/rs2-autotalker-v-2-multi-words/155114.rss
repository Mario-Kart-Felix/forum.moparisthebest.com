&lt;----Instructions----&gt;
1. Ok First As You See There Are Talk, Say, Talk2, Say2, TalkAgain. First Fill In What You Want It To Say In The (&#39; &#39;) Marks.
{Rememeber They All Go In Order So Try To Mix Up The Texts} If You Want To Only Have Say, Two Of The Talk, Say, Talk2, Say2, TalkAgain Just Leave The Fields Empty.

2. After Done With That Start Up Runescape (Better If Game Client) Go To Login Screen, Dont Log In! Specifie The RS Window By Clicking The Specifie Mark Thingy.

3. Then Log In Normaly Once Logged In Press SCAR And Run The Script. Right After You Run The Script Click On Runescape Again 
And Begin Playing Normally. 

4. Just Walk Around And Watch SCAR Do All The Hard Typing For You. Enjoy =)

&lt;----Credits----&gt;
To WhoCares357 For Creating The Best [TUT] For Noobies.
To The Makers Of SCAR In Witch None Of This Would Be Possible.



[code]//LevExidus AutoTalker V.2
//For The Newbies Out There Feel Free To Use This To Learn How To Script.
program AutoTalker;
{.Include SRL/SRL.Scar}
  // if you want to only have a certain
  //amount of text just keep them blank.
  //to prevent you from being detected i suggest
  //you dont change the TWait. For better
  //protection make it higher.
const
Talk=&#39;Text Here&#39;; //what to say
TWait=2000;//time to wait after typing
Say=&#39;More Text Here&#39;; // Second Text
Talk2=&#39;More Text Here&#39;; //Third text
Say2=&#39;More Text Here&#39;; // Fourth Text
TalkAgain=&#39;More Text Here&#39;; // Last Text (Fifth)

procedure TalkOn;
begin
repeat //Reapeats the following:
Wait(TWait+random(700));
typesend(Talk); // types text in const and presses enter. Remember! SendKeysSilent Will Get You Banned! Do Not Use!
typesend(Say); //Same As above. 
typesend(Talk2); // Same As Above
typesend(Say2); //Same As Above
typesend(TalkAgain); //Same As Above
until(false); //False = never ends.. Ends Repeat.
end;

begin //BEGINS
repeat  //Repeats The Foloing:
TalkOn;  // Does everything in procedure TalkOn;
until(false) //keeps going Forever.. Ends Repeat.
end.  //End of Script[/code]

If You Are Experiencing Any Problems Please Tell Me. I&#39;m Looking Forward To Scripting Even More And Better Scripts. Oh And BTW (by the way) LevExidus AutoTalker V.1 is available in the SCAR First Script Section For Those Who Are New With SCAR. Try V.1 To Better Understand AutoTalkers.


P.S: Can Someone Please PM Me On How To Make Advance AutoTalkers and such?
Oh And For The Pro&#39;s: Is it Possible to have SCAR just randomly pick the sentences put in by the user and type it? To decrease possibility of being banned? 
Hope Everyone Enjoi&#39;s! I Also Made It Noob Friendly For People Looking Over This And Want To Learn Whats Going On. I Attached The Download On The Bottom Of The Post Enjoi! Dont Worry Download is Clean! Scan If You Really Want! (I dont think a 13 year old boy that just learned HTML and SCAR is going to know to put anything bad in his downloads)Just Remember The Instructions And You Will Be Fine! I Dont Want A Hundred PM&#39;s On How To Work It! Hopefully I Wont Or Im Just Getting Out Of Luck Here! I Am Now Working On LevExidus AutoTalker V.3 B.P! Be Sure To Keep Checking!
