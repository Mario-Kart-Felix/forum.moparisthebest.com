    <title>Any of these?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-of-these/292359</link>
    <description>My friend is sorta into evony. I think its alright but tbh i wish you could see your citizens and evony feels very unprofessional to me and rushed due to the fact that i saw &#39;Aquest 01 2009&#39; and not &#39;August&#39;.

What im wondering is if there&#39;s any games like evony (you can build buildings see your economy etc) and also see citizens and that is multiplayer? 

Id prefer free but if there&#39;s any cheap ones like this let me know.</description>

              <p>Anno 1404, I love it although there is no multiplayer you don’t really need it because you get the AI and you can manage your resources and tax and shit. I also heard East India Company with the Pirate Bay add-on is pretty decent, although you’re mainly being a pirate and shit which is completely unrelated to building and economy.</p>
