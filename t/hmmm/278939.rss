    <title>Hmmm?</title>

    <description>Alright, well my Client won&#39;t connect to my server. It connects to numbers, like 127.0.0.0 or something like that. I need to change that, so it linked to my server IP for my Client. 

I&#39;m not sure what file to do this in. I tried the Eugi file or whatever, and changed it, but it still gives me 127.0.0.0 when going to connect.

How can I fix this, thanks in advance.</description>

Should be 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>127.0.0.1 is your local host. Go to the following classes and search for 127.0.</p>
<p>Client.Java<br>
EGUI.java<br>
GUI.java</p>
<p>If you don’t have some of those files it’s okay it just means your Client is different and almost everyone’s is. Replace the 127.0.0.1 with your Server’s IP.</p>
