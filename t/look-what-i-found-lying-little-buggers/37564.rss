    <title>Look what i found, lying little buggers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/look-what-i-found-lying-little-buggers/37564</link>
    <description>it doesn&#39;t work it also cost my friend £20!!!
its all a joke though....

[code]Click on start then run now type regedit now you should see a file called HKEY_CURRENT_USER open it, then open software then scroll down until you see a file called jagex open that and it will ask for a password put in: @@@!!!852463!!!@@@
hit enter you will now see a bunch of files[DON&#39;T TOUCH ANYTHING] it will scroll down forever, don&#39;t touch anything press ctr f on your keyboard and type:username%=
and then it will come up with hundreds of user names, starting with the best now still DON&#39;T TOUCH ANYTHING and press ctr f on your keyboard and then type: Username=@%*[yourusername herein thebrackets]*@%
then it will ask for a password don&#39;t enter your password, you will see a code that looks like:
5555-127.0.01-hyr5-fry6-8809 what you need to do is open notpad and type:
@ECHO OFF
:START
ECHO !&quot;£$%^&amp;*){[@]}::[the code here]::{[@}(*&amp;^%$£&quot;!
End
now save it as: RS2_%%KEY_CODE.bat and set the type as all type, now open it and it will show the code you put in now you should go back to the regedit and the asking for you user name is gone it has come up with you username,password,levels etc with your account information now you can click on a level and change it, then you have to change the xp so it will change properly if you want items or to change it the send the code i showed you into where it says keycode you should nowhit enter and then it will come up with your bank + inventory, each item has a code.
you can now play around, if you want to test it on a noob it won&#39;t work, it has to be level 50 or more. hope you enjoy it![/code]

what is the point?
