    <title>Delta clean up: Objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-clean-up-objects/423948</link>
    <description>So if anyone knows Delta like I do. EVERYTHING is located in the client.java
I don&#39;t feel like learning PI just yet but I want to make my Delta the best I can.
I want to start with objects because well they are by far the clunkiest besides commands. Now I do have a objects.cfg but for some reason it doesn&#39;t work. It probably needs to be re-wrote into the server but that is the part I don&#39;t know.
How do you add it in, and is there a way to change how the Object cfg works?

At the top of mine it says:
[code]//------ClsdID---XCoord--YCoord--CDir----OpenID--OpenX---OpenY---ODir [/code]

Now I want to change it to something like what my objects currently look like (but without the makeGlobalObject, and not in client.java) which is something like this:
[code]makeGlobalObject(2525, 4639, 2111, -3, 10); // Mining Rock[/code]
That means it would look like this on top of the Object.cfg:
[code]------XCoord--YCoord--ClsdID--CDir--(and what ever the 10 is.)[/code]

I don&#39;t know if just changing what it says at the top will in fact change what it puts out. But I&#39;d like to know.
Please and thank you :)</description>

So if u want to make it in a new file, u prob should have to make a java file to like Objects.java<br>
Else u have to use a code to load the .cfg, maybe take a look how npc.cfg or others are imported and try to make a code based of that.[/quote]</p>
<p>You didn’t even read anything I said did you?</p>
