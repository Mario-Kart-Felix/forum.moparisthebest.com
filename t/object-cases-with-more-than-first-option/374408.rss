    <title>Object Cases with More Than First Option</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/object-cases-with-more-than-first-option/374408</link>
    <description>NOTE: I have an Allstar base. Only give me answers with Allstar or Delta (I can translate Delta).

For example,

I have a ladder (object ID= 1748). I have the option of &quot;climb&quot;, &quot;climb-up&quot;, and &quot;climb-down&quot;. If you were to code the ladder to use the case 1748, you&#39;d be coding the &quot;climb&quot; option. But what do you do to code the cases for &quot;climb-up&quot; and &quot;climb-down&quot;?

This concept is similar to farming too. How would I code the &quot;inspect&quot; and &quot;guide&quot; rather than just &quot;harvest&quot;?


Anywho, for the &quot;climb&quot; option of the ladder, I tried incorporating NpcWanneTalk as an option to select &quot;Up&quot; or &quot;Down&quot; and then using those answers to teleport your heightLevel -1 or +1. That failed. 

Is there a way to have a selective option of &quot;Up&quot; or &quot;Down&quot; when coding case 1748 for the ladder? This isn&#39;t mandatory for me if I can code the other options of &quot;climb-up&quot; and &quot;climb-down&quot;. Please help anyone!

Thanks Much, (Rep ++ to the wonderful helper)
