    <description>Hey,

Whenever i log in to my server with a 317 Deob, my character starts doing odd emotes(bouncing head, etc), it also looks like my character name becomes encrypted. The same happens when i login with the Mopar client.

Does anyone know what could cause this?
I would really like to create my own client from scratch(with a deob).

Thanks in advance.</description>
