Hey, I&#39;m running a PI server and I want to know how I could make a few random events? Specifically, I want to make the Genie &amp; The Mysterious Old Man.

I want to make it so that the Genie appears, says something like &quot;Greetings, PLAYERNAME. Here&#39;s a small gift!&quot; and make it so he gives the player an XP lamp or something. For the Mysterious Old Man, I want to make it so he appears and says something similar, and follows the player around until they talk to him. 

When they talk to him, they should receive about 50k cash. If they don&#39;t talk to him within a certain time frame, however, they should be teleported to the top of White Wolf Mountain or somewhere equally as gloomy/annoying.</description>
