    <description>1) Hi, please [b]don&#39;t[/b] re-create a thread that already exists and has been answered. It saves a  lot of time for people that are trying to help you. What I mean by this is just say if someone opened a topic saying &quot;Need help finding Java&quot;, you don&#39;t need to make a new thread saying &quot;Where&#39;s Java I need help?&quot; it&#39;s probably already been answered.  

2) Also even though it&#39;s already been covered I&#39;d like to say be specific in your title threads! Instead of saying &quot;I need help&quot; say &quot;I need help on...&quot;  

3) DON&#39;T create a poll if it&#39;s just going to be spam, what&#39;s the point?  

Thanks and happing posting. :)
