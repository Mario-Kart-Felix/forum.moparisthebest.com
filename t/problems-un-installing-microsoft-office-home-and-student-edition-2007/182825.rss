    <title>Problems Un-Installing Microsoft Office Home and Student Edition 2007</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-un-installing-microsoft-office-home-and-student-edition-2007/182825</link>
    <description>Hey, guys. I haven&#39;t been here for quite a while. Anyway, I got a brand new laptop for Christmas with Windows Vista and it came with a free 30-day trial of Microsoft Office Home and Student Edition 2007. Now, I looked on quite a few websites for product keys and found quite a few. It said that they worked but they didn&#39;t so I tried to do this thing where you change something on the &quot;proof.en&quot; file and I ended up deleting the whole thing :( So now, I can&#39;t un-install the damn thing and when I do try it says: &quot;The language of this installation package is not supported by your system&quot; I NEED to get rid of it. How do I un-install it without fucking my laptop up?


Regards, Nick. ;)</description>

I had the exact same problem, Try deleting all the program files first and Use Ccleaner to delete it from the list. Not sure if that works, I cant remember how I got rid of my trials.<br>

That seems to work. Thanks.[/quote]<br>
Thats good that you got it, and also look for “blue edition” if you want it full enterprise style. Can’t post any links <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
