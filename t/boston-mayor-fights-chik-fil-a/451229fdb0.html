<p>[quote=Niall]…and donate to anti-gay charities who are part of a political movement</p>
<p>are you really so dense that you believe that they’re only stating their opinion?[/quote]</p>
<p>So you don’t believe it is within the corporation’s rights to donate to a charity of their choice?[/quote]</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that a corporation can donate to whomever they want, however I consider it extremely distasteful to donate to a charity which engages in a political movement, I am undecided on whether or not I believe a corporation should be able to engage in such behaviour</p>
<p>maybe I didn’t make it clear, I’m not necessarily agreeing with the letter from the mayor of boston to chik-fil-a however I am completely for any boycotts to chik-fil-a</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>[quote]sure does, however having an opinion and being head of an organisation that is contributing to anti-gay charities making political moves is a completely different ballgame</p>
<p>if chik-fil-a donated to the kkk or wbc there would be just as much outrage and rightly so</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Once again, I believe Chik-fil-a has the right to donate money to whomever they want to. Even if they don’t<br>
do you think the government should step in or the stock holders or the citizens or…?[/quote]</p>
<p>once again I must state I am undecided on the matter because it’s a complicated issue with many things to consider, many of which I haven’t considered</p>
<p>the issue I have with corporations being able to donate to charities with political ties or political parties is that they can also donate to political parties that can limit the rights of citizens(and as donations have no limits on donating to charities where as they may do on political parties, donating to charities with ties to a political party is very much so exploiting the law), I am very much against political parties being able to remove civil or human rights from citizens or a group of citizens and I consider the issue of same-sex marriage to be a civil rights issue (where there’s no other option granting <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> the legal rights marriage does)</p>
<p>however as a hypothetical situation to explain some of my thought process, if I were to believe that chik-fil-a shouldn’t be allowed to donate to anti-same-sex marriage political parties, I do not think they should be closed down or people fired, I simply believe they shouldn’t have the legal option to donate to those charities on a corporate level, if the workers, ceo and whomever want to donate then they should do be allowed to do so but with their own money and not the corporations money[/quote]</p>
<p>That is a good point. However, it shouldn’t be up to the Government to decide. The people should decide. The people should have the option to boycott a product.</p>
<blockquote>[quote author=m1lkman link=topic=554116.msg4060311#msg4060311 date=1343351919]
[quote]for the record I would be just as opposed to chik-fil-a if they were donating to pro-marriage charities [/quote]
I'll assume you are against corporations donating to charities as a whole. Correct me if I'm wrong.[/quote]
I'm all for donating to charities with no political ties, such as doctors without borders to name one
<p>the issue I have is charities such as the salvation army who actively discriminate between whom they offer help to, and I have issues with charities whom are involved in political movements whereby its no better than charities donating to political parties themselves (see my previous comment about oil companies, as oil companies have donated and supported parties to allow them to exploit something they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to exploit, purely in the interest of profit for the companies and ceos and not for the people)</p>
</blockquote><br>
I have a problem with <span class="bbcode-s">charities</span> bribes using people’s money to carry out their own agenda for profit. I have a problem with the government trying to step in and force the hand of corporations who stand up for what they <span class="bbcode-b">think</span> is right. I think it goes against the Constitution.
<blockquote>however I consider it extremely bad taste and consider the right for people to be able to legally boycott the company to be extremely essential</blockquote>
I agree completely. If the people find something wrong with the corporation as a whole then they should boycott the corporation. I don't think it's the government's responsibility or duty to step in, that should be left up to the people.
<p><span class="mention">@your</span> second edit,</p>
<p>In that case, should incredibly rich people be able to donate to programs that they support? What is the difference between a corporation donating 5 million dollars and a single person donating 5 million dollars?</p>

I don’t think anybody , company or individual has the right to tell another person that they are not welcomed somewhere. I may not approve of gays my ownself personally but I don’t condemn them either.</p>
<p>If the CEO of the company thought about it, the bible even says that only God has the right to judge a persons actions not a  mere mortal.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The bible wasn’t written by Jesus/God, it was written by men that believed they knew him.[/quote]<br>
And scientific theories, that so many non-believes believe, are written by men and women who thought they knew; so whats your point?</p>
