<p>What about the loss of jobs?</p>

        <p>“We have to think about more than profit.”<br>
That is my response to your argument about the job loss.</p>
<p>“If you promote your company as being a bigot, you can GTFO.”<br>
That is the response to : “What about the small privately owned companies that end up being forced to change their religious and political views so the government won’t shut them down?”.</p>
<p>To defend the job issue with something more solid:<br>
You free-marked people should work this out pretty easy. By kicking out Chik-fil-a you are removing the supply of their products, but the demand is still there. So that gap can be filled by other fast food chains, or a new one can fill the gap. Both of those solution would create the necessary jobs. Chik-fil-a could always stop the promoting of hatred and can continue their business.</p>

<p>It’s obvious we disagree on this concept. So you’re saying that government should control the way people think. That’s what you are essentially saying. You are scaring private businesses into changing their political and religious views. Scaring that right to hold one’s own opinion from privately owned businesses is unamerican. I don’t care if that’s a weak excuse, it goes against everything the founding fathers worked for.</p>

<p>Again, you father is free to be a bigot, but not his company. It seems like you are in support of hatred and bigotry. So my question to you is why?</p>

        <p>Let us see if that is unconstitutional.</p>

<li>

<p>“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”<br>
It speaks of press and the people, not corporations. So I would say that is not unconstitutional. So add a state law that makes Boston’s action legal (If it isn’t). And then just wait for Chik-fil-a do commit the crime, or follow the law.</p>
<p>Remember that it is more to a law than the constitution. I speak about what the government should be allowed to do, based on the principle of equal rights. A principle all non-hypocrites can agree to.</p>

        <p>[quote=“m1lkman, post:52, topic:451229”][quote=Niall]…and donate to anti-gay charities who are part of a political movement</p>
<p>are you really so dense that you believe that they’re only stating their opinion?[/quote]</p>
<p>So you don’t believe it is within the corporation’s rights to donate to a charity of their choice?[/quote]</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that a corporation can donate to whomever they want, however I consider it extremely distasteful to donate to a charity which engages in a political movement, I am undecided on whether or not I believe a corporation should be able to engage in such behaviour</p>
<p>maybe I didn’t make it clear, I’m not necessarily agreeing with the letter from the mayor of boston to chik-fil-a however I am completely for any boycotts to chik-fil-a</p>
<p>[quote=“m1lkman, post:52, topic:451229”][quote]sure does, however having an opinion and being head of an organisation that is contributing to anti-gay charities making political moves is a completely different ballgame</p>
<p>if chik-fil-a donated to the kkk or wbc there would be just as much outrage and rightly so<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Once again, I believe Chik-fil-a has the right to donate money to whomever they want to. Even if they don’t<br>
do you think the government should step in or the stock holders or the citizens or…?[/quote]</p>
<p>once again I must state I am undecided on the matter because it’s a complicated issue with many things to consider, many of which I haven’t considered</p>
<p>the issue I have with corporations being able to donate to charities with political ties or political parties is that they can also donate to political parties that can limit the rights of citizens(and as donations have no limits on donating to charities where as they may do on political parties, donating to charities with ties to a political party is very much so exploiting the law), I am very much against political parties being able to remove civil or human rights from citizens or a group of citizens and I consider the issue of same-sex marriage to be a civil rights issue (where there’s no other option granting <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> the legal rights marriage does)</p>
<p>however as a hypothetical situation to explain some of my thought process, if I were to believe that chik-fil-a shouldn’t be allowed to donate to anti-same-sex marriage political parties, I do not think they should be closed down or people fired, I simply believe they shouldn’t have the legal option to donate to those charities on a corporate level, if the workers, ceo and whomever want to donate then they should do be allowed to do so but with their own money and not the corporations money</p>

<p>[quote]for the record I would be just as opposed to chik-fil-a if they were donating to pro-marriage charities </p>

</aside>
<p>I’ll assume you are against corporations donating to charities as a whole. Correct me if I’m wrong.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m all for donating to charities with no political ties, such as doctors without borders to name one</p>
<p>the issue I have is charities such as the salvation army who actively discriminate between whom they offer help to, and I have issues with charities whom are involved in political movements whereby its no better than charities donating to political parties themselves (see my previous comment about oil companies, as oil companies have donated and supported parties to allow them to exploit something they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to exploit, purely in the interest of profit for the companies and ceos and not for the people)</p>

<p>I stand firm that if Chik-fil-a wishes to donate to any charity of their choice it is their right.[/quote]</p>
<p>and like I said in my previous post I am undecided therefore not necessarily against it either, however I consider it extremely bad taste and consider the right for people to be able to legally boycott the company to be extremely essential</p>

</aside>
<p>I would disagree morally. I do believe that they have the right to donate to the charity of their choice.[/quote]</p>
<p>very well</p>
<p>EDIT: engrish, confused? then I probably worded it horribly, ask for an explanation and ye shall receive</p>
<p>EDIT2: again let me explain some of my thought process, it’s not of the people by the people for the people when a giant corporation can vote on laws that may only necessarily benefit them, free speech is free speech but money buys advertisement which brings in votes and the party with the most funding is likely to get the most votes and giant corporations can have a huge, HUGEEEE impact on this to manipulate the system</p>
