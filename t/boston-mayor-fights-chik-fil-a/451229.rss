    <description>http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/23/boston-mayor-blocks-chick-fil-a-franchise-from-city-over-homophobic-attitude/

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Chick-fil-A doesn’t belong in Boston,” Menino told the Boston Herald on Thursday. “You can’t have a business in the city of Boston that discriminates against the population. We’re an open city, we’re a city that’s at the forefront of inclusion. That’s the Freedom Trail. That’s where it all started right here. And we’re not going to have a company, Chick-fil-A or whatever the hell the name is, on our Freedom Trail.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chik-fil-A&#39;s response:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect — regardless of their belief, race creed, sexual orientation or gender. Going forward our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All I know is Boston is missing out on some good chicken and sauce.</description>

I don’t think anybody , company or individual has the right to tell another person that they are not welcomed somewhere. I may not approve of gays my ownself personally but I don’t condemn them either.</p>
<p>If the CEO of the company thought about it, the bible even says that only God has the right to judge a persons actions not a  mere mortal.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The bible wasn’t written by Jesus/God, it was written by men that believed they knew him.[/quote]<br>
And scientific theories, that so many non-believes believe, are written by men and women who thought they knew; so whats your point?</p>

<p>So you don’t believe it is within the corporation’s rights to donate to a charity of their choice?[/quote]</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that a corporation can donate to whomever they want, however I consider it extremely distasteful to donate to a charity which engages in a political movement, I am undecided on whether or not I believe a corporation should be able to engage in such behaviour</p>
<p>maybe I didn’t make it clear, I’m not necessarily agreeing with the letter from the mayor of boston to chik-fil-a however I am completely for any boycotts to chik-fil-a</p>

<p>Once again, I believe Chik-fil-a has the right to donate money to whomever they want to. Even if they don’t<br>
do you think the government should step in or the stock holders or the citizens or…?[/quote]</p>
<p>once again I must state I am undecided on the matter because it’s a complicated issue with many things to consider, many of which I haven’t considered</p>
<p>the issue I have with corporations being able to donate to charities with political ties or political parties is that they can also donate to political parties that can limit the rights of citizens(and as donations have no limits on donating to charities where as they may do on political parties, donating to charities with ties to a political party is very much so exploiting the law), I am very much against political parties being able to remove civil or human rights from citizens or a group of citizens and I consider the issue of same-sex marriage to be a civil rights issue (where there’s no other option granting <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> the legal rights marriage does)</p>
<p>however as a hypothetical situation to explain some of my thought process, if I were to believe that chik-fil-a shouldn’t be allowed to donate to anti-same-sex marriage political parties, I do not think they should be closed down or people fired, I simply believe they shouldn’t have the legal option to donate to those charities on a corporate level, if the workers, ceo and whomever want to donate then they should do be allowed to do so but with their own money and not the corporations money[/quote]</p>
<p>That is a good point. However, it shouldn’t be up to the Government to decide. The people should decide. The people should have the option to boycott a product.</p>

I'll assume you are against corporations donating to charities as a whole. Correct me if I'm wrong.[/quote]
I'm all for donating to charities with no political ties, such as doctors without borders to name one
<p>the issue I have is charities such as the salvation army who actively discriminate between whom they offer help to, and I have issues with charities whom are involved in political movements whereby its no better than charities donating to political parties themselves (see my previous comment about oil companies, as oil companies have donated and supported parties to allow them to exploit something they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to exploit, purely in the interest of profit for the companies and ceos and not for the people)</p>
</blockquote><br>
I have a problem with <span class="bbcode-s">charities</span> bribes using people’s money to carry out their own agenda for profit. I have a problem with the government trying to step in and force the hand of corporations who stand up for what they <span class="bbcode-b">think</span> is right. I think it goes against the Constitution.
<blockquote>however I consider it extremely bad taste and consider the right for people to be able to legally boycott the company to be extremely essential</blockquote>
I agree completely. If the people find something wrong with the corporation as a whole then they should boycott the corporation. I don't think it's the government's responsibility or duty to step in, that should be left up to the people.
<p><span class="mention">@your</span> second edit,</p>
<p>In that case, should incredibly rich people be able to donate to programs that they support? What is the difference between a corporation donating 5 million dollars and a single person donating 5 million dollars?</p>

It speaks of press and the people, not corporations. So I would say that is not unconstitutional. So add a state law that makes Boston’s action legal (If it isn’t). And then just wait for Chik-fil-a do commit the crime, or follow the law.</p>
<p>Remember that it is more to a law than the constitution. I speak about what the government should be allowed to do, based on the principle of equal rights. A principle all non-hypocrites can agree to.</p>

<p>“I stand firm that if Chik-fil-a wishes to donate to any charity of their choice it is their right.”<br>
The big problem is to donate to a political agenda, donating to KKK and anti-gay group isn’t charity.</p>

I'll assume you are against corporations donating to charities as a whole. Correct me if I'm wrong.

<p>There is a difference between hating gays and not wanting them to be married but whatever.</p>
<p>Why shouldn’t he (my father) be allowed to promote his own views? Why should we just stop at hateful/ignorant opinions, why not just make the government control all privately owned companies’ opinions?</p>

<p>It’s obvious we disagree on this concept. So you’re saying that government should control the way people think. That’s what you are essentially saying. You are scaring private businesses into changing their political and religious views. Scaring that right to hold one’s own opinion from privately owned businesses is unamerican. I don’t care if that’s a weak excuse, it goes against everything the founding fathers worked for.</p>

That is my response to your argument about the job loss.</p>

<p>To defend the job issue with something more solid:<br>
You free-marked people should work this out pretty easy. By kicking out Chik-fil-a you are removing the supply of their products, but the demand is still there. So that gap can be filled by other fast food chains, or a new one can fill the gap. Both of those solution would create the necessary jobs. Chik-fil-a could always stop the promoting of hatred and can continue their business.</p>

yes and the mayor is allowed to remove it from his city.[/quote]<br>
No he isn’t. Not at all. It should be up to the citizens to boycott the product.</p>

<p>If the CEO is saying"your gay so your going to hell" do you really think if he could  control who is  able to get service don’t you think he would  try to stop gays from eating there? Let’s be serious</p>

</aside>
<p>Uhh, can you please post some evidence where a chik-fil-a has denied service to anybody of any race/gender/sexual orientation and hasn’t been punished or taken care of? How would Chik-fil-a even know that person was even gay? I’ve never been asked. Have you?</p>

This is about whether the government should be interfering with a business or not. By the way, the ceo never said that gays aren’t welcome to eat at Chik-fil-a.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Don’t you love our ideological differences, because I see no problem in government intervention in private businesses. So tell me, why is this bad?[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s unamerican. If we start shutting people’s businesses down because of their viewpoints then we, as a country, are in a lot more trouble. If Chik-fil-a was shutdown, nationwide, think of how many people would lose their jobs. Think of how many other privately owned businesses would be shut down. My dad’s private company (has 2 people in it) are against gay marriage. The government should come in and shut them down?</p>
<p>I know this doesn’t apply to the argument but Chik-fil-a has the BEST customer service among all the other fast food chains. I know it’s just an opinion but alot of Americans feel that way. After doing a quick google search, “Which fast food company has the best customer service”, this came up in the second slot. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/resources/customer/chickfila.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fastcompany.com/resources/customer/chickfila.html</a></p>
