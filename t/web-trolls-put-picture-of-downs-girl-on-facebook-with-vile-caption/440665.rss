    <description>[url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4278427/Web-trolls-put-picture-of-Downs-Syndrome-girl-on-Facebook-with-vile-caption.html]Web trolls put picture of Down&#39;s girl on Facebook with vile caption (www.thesun.co.uk)[/url]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tearful Heidi Crowter has only just been told about the sexual and derogatory comments being made about an innocent picture of her online.

The 16-year-old has been the target of several other sick pages on Facebook bearing her image.

The photos of Heidi, from Coventry, as a toddler had been stolen from a website for a parents’ support group.

Horrified mum Liz and husband Steve have been bombarding Facebook to take down the sites and so far only one has been removed.

Liz, 45, said the internet trolls behind the posts had been using images of her daughter for months and Facebook had made no direct contact with her to resolve the issue.

Heidi’s pictures were taken from a local support group website, which Liz ran for about five years.

She said pages carrying Heidi’s image are still active despite Liz reporting the problem TWO WEEKS ago.

She said: “It’s almost like Faceless rather than Facebook, we have been repeatedly trying to take these distressing sites down and I have not once had a direct response.

“These trolls are cowardly, nasty people who should be punished for the damage they are doing to people with their comments.

“They have no right to take Heidi’s image and use it alongside these cruel sites. If you look at the lad who made those comments about Fabrice Muamba online, he was taken to court.

“Heidi has told me she is very upset by the sites and she turns her head away when we have them on the computer screen.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>as mopman pointed out, nice strawman</p>
<p>I don’t know why anyone bought the liam stacey/muamba thing up(well, I do, it’s the sun we’re talking about, their journalism standards are non-existent), with liam stacey he posted really quite vulgar and racist comments directed at individuals that if said in public could be used to start a fight and put innocent people at risk, it doesn’t quite compare to what’s going on here</p>

</aside>
<p>it can certainly be a hatecrime but this is a very awkward situation, on one hand you have the meme/image caption/advice animal which is usually pretty tame (by the internet’s standards, just in bad taste by everyone else’s standards), on the other hand what you have (if the sun’s account of things is to be trusted, <span class="bbcode-b">and it is never to be trusted</span>) is this girl being harassed and bullied on facebook which can be considered a hatecrime</p>
<p>and just to put this on the table, I don’t think anyone agreed with locking liam stacey up for 56 days and personally I don’t think anyone should be locked up for saying offensive things but as most uk citizens and the law has decided, people shouldn’t have the right to harass minorities and the vulnerable and “get away with it” legally, but as with blowing it up in the media the case will be blown out of proportion regardless of country</p>

<blockquote>Tearful Heidi Crowter has only just been told about the sexual and derogatory comments being made about an innocent picture of her online.
<p>The 16-year-old has been the target of several other sick pages on Facebook bearing her image.</p>
<p>The photos of Heidi, from Coventry, as a toddler had been stolen from a website for a parents’ support group.</p>
<p>Horrified mum Liz and husband Steve have been bombarding Facebook to take down the sites and so far only one has been removed.</p>
<p>Liz, 45, said the internet trolls behind the posts had been using images of her daughter for months and Facebook had made no direct contact with her to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Heidi’s pictures were taken from a local support group website, which Liz ran for about five years.</p>
<p>She said pages carrying Heidi’s image are still active despite Liz reporting the problem TWO WEEKS ago.</p>
<p>She said: “It’s almost like Faceless rather than Facebook, we have been repeatedly trying to take these distressing sites down and I have not once had a direct response.</p>
<p>“These trolls are cowardly, nasty people who should be punished for the damage they are doing to people with their comments.</p>
<p>“They have no right to take Heidi’s image and use it alongside these cruel sites. If you look at the lad who made those comments about Fabrice Muamba online, he was taken to court.</p>
<p>“Heidi has told me she is very upset by the sites and she turns her head away when we have them on the computer screen.”</p>
