    <title>Will host a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/will-host-a-server/303374</link>
    <description>Hi all,
I&#39;m really bored and want to be part of a server,
So what i propose to do is host your server for you.

you will have owner rights etc..
Your acc will be owner and the client/server will be set up by you.

Post a reply if your interested in me hosting it for you.

However,
I can only host 1 server!

Hosting times will most likely be 24/7</description>
