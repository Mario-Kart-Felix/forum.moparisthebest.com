    <title>Adding items on an interface (frame 246 explained)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-items-on-an-interface-frame-246-explained/329846</link>
    <description>This is how to add items onto most interfaces in private servers

I&#39;ve seen alot of questions about this, so i thought I would explain it. Sorry if someones posted this before, i don&#39;t use this forum much. This is pretty complicated so ima try to explain this as best I can, so dont flame me if you dont get it.

Requirements
Basic java knowledge(Medium-Advance Recommended, but some beginners might get it)
Familiar with 317 sources
How to do 2nd grade adding
How to read crap written by a dude from the south thats sick and on alot of medicine

Frame 246 deals with adding items on an interface. NOTE-this does not mean you can put items anywhere, there are predesignated areas just like frame 126(the sendQuest frame)

246 is triggered by the following void(that i DID NOT CREATE, it usually comes standard on servers)
[code]
  public void sendFrame246(int MainFrame, int SubFrame, int SubFrame2) {
    outStream.createFrame(246);
    outStream.writeWordBigEndian(MainFrame);
    outStream.writeWord(SubFrame);
    outStream.writeWord(SubFrame2);
    flushOutStream();
  }[/code]

Ill explain how the void works

&lt;blockquote&gt;    sendFrame246 - sends frame 246..duh
    int MainFrame - the number of the place the item goes
    int SubFrame - the size of the item, ill go into detail later
    int SubFrame2 - the id of the item that is places on the interface
    outStream.createFrame(246) - actually creates the frame
    outStream.writeWordBigEndian(MainFrame) - tells which spot to write the item in
    outStream.writeWord(SubFrame) - tells the size
    outStream.writeWord(SubFrame2) - tells the item id
    flushOutStream() - does the actual writing&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Heres info on the sizes, Ill put in quotes cause i fell like it

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sizes can range from 0 to around 1000. anymore than 1000 and it should take up the entire screen :o
The size of runes on the spell menu are around size 75
Items in your inventory are around 150&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heres how to find the actual spot the item goes in. Its a very rough and simi complex system i created myself and ill explain it. (NOTE-if you didnt no, add this in

&lt;blockquote&gt;public void customCommand(String command)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

if for some nooby reason you didnt no)

[code]
            if (command.startsWith(&quot;sf&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights == 3) {
                        String[] args = command.split(&quot; &quot;);
                        int range1 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
                        int range2 = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
                        int item = 1;
                        for(int i = range1; i &lt;= range2; i++) {
                                item++;
                                sendFrame246(i, 100, item);
                        }
            }[/code]

Explanation of command
&lt;blockquote&gt;if (command.startsWith(&quot;sf&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights == 3) - if the command starts with the letters &quot;sf&quot; and you are the owner or coowner
String[] args = command.split(&quot; &quot;) - separates the command into different parts everytime you use a space in the command
int range1 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]) - the numbers after the first space
int range2 = Integer.parseInt(args[2]) - the numbers after the second space
int item = 1 - ill explain the &quot;item&quot; part later
for(int i = range1; i &lt;= range2; i++) - a very interesting system, the count process starts at range1, and stops as range2
item++ - makes the item count go up, will explain later
sendFrame246(i, 100, item) - sends the frame on spot i which was declared up lines up, size 100, and the item&lt;/blockquote&gt;

here the &quot;item&quot; system i said um...5 lines up that i would explain
I made it so that the item starts at item id 1 and sends it on the first &quot;spot &#39;i&#39; &quot;, then when the spot increases, the item increases

EXAMPLE - WARNING THIS IS THE HARD AND COMPLICATED PART

&lt;blockquote&gt;i type in the command ::sf 200 400
an item appears an the place i want it to be, and the item is a bucket of wax. the id for the bucket will be 200 or less(because range2, which is 400, minus range1, which is 200, is..200..cool youre doin math now)
i find the id for the bucket of wax, which is 30.
you then add the id of the item with the FIRST number in the command(range1)
so since 200+30 is..230 the spot SHOULD be 230, for wutever the reason, its sometimes 1 or 2 ids off.
you would then add wherever u wanted it
lets say that you wanted item 5280 with size 275 on the spot where the bucket of wax was, you would then add this code wherever u want it&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[code]
sendFrame246(230, 275, 5280);[/code]

PROBLEMS
if you check spots near spot 3321 it will not work, because it was a nulled/bugged/glitched/wutevered spot, and you would get disconnected. the same problem occurs if the id is too high.
another problem is if the item is a note, because all notes..look the same
this can be solved(mostly) by add 1 number to your range1(the first number in the command)

ACTUALLY ADDING IT INTO SOMETHING
say you want to add sendFrame246(230, 275, 5280) and it was on the interface 100, you would make this void

[code]
public void doIDontCare() {
sendFrame246(230, 275, 5280);
showInterface(100);
}[/code]

This should works fine, i explained it probably as best as I can, any problems or errors comment or message me

I take requests for tutorials for anything on 317 sources
