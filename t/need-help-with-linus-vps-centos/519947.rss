    <title>Need help with Linus Vps (Centos)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-linus-vps-centos/519947</link>
    <description>I have been looking around for current tuts on how to setup my RSPS on a linux vps and have found nothing recent. The steps to do this are very confusing being a newcomer, and I would like somebodys help. No I will not give you the VPS info, I just need a step by step kinda.

If someone can help me/give me a recent tut this would help me so much. I know I probably sound stupid to most of you because you&#39;ve been doing this for awhile but I just need some help.

Thank you.</description>
