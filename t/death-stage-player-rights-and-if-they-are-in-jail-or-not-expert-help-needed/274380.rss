    <title>Death stage, player rights and if they are in jail or not? (expert help needed)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/death-stage-player-rights-and-if-they-are-in-jail-or-not-expert-help-needed/274380</link>
    <description>Ok im looking too create something that stops people hanging around my jail. i want them too die if they enter certain coords around the jail. the only exceptions are people with player rights +1 or if they have actually been jailed.

i can figure the code out if they are staff or not, but how is someone determined between being jailed and not being jailed?

and how can i apply a deathstage too them from that?

thanks alot.</description>
