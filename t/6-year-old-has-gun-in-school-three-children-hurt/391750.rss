<p>100% Agreed.</p>
<p>My parents taught me about guns from a very young age, and I would never have dreamed of even touching one unless my dad was around and gave me permission.  I think part of the problem is parents don’t talk to their children about guns, and so they are curious and don’t know the danger.</p>
<p>But yes, this is entirely the stupid parent’s fault.</p>
