<p>It doesn’t take “skills” to help with a problem like this. I tried helping him earlier and he just kind of ignored me. When I asked him to post his code I wasn’t being a smartass if that’s what you thought, though it may have looked that way. Whatever, his problem is fixed because he had common sense and did it himself.</p>
