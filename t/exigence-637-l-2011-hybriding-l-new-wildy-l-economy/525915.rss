[FONT=Century Gothic]Established in 2012, Exigence has been known through many communities as an economy pking server. With the capability of providing a wonderful pking experience we also bring all of the memories back. We began with a 718 in 2012 in cooperation with Ambition-PK which shut down shortly after to all of the ddos attacks. I have worked with Aero on his magnificent source for more than a week to improve it&#39;s stability and overall content. With City Pking, East Dragons and MB pking we bring back the 2011 Hybrid experience with a mixture of past and new events. Pack up your teams and venture on over here for a great pking experience. [/FONT]

[ADMIN=Server Overview][CENTER][FONT=Century Gothic]This server is unlike any other, instead of spawning for items our server brings you a well developed economy. Starting out with small supply of coins and a few welfare sets, our server is the perfect fit for economy players and pkers. Whilst offering a pking system which includes random coin drops upon kills and PKP we also offer skilling and PVM to grow our economy. Grow and challenge your friends on Exigence to obtain more valuable items that can be purchased from other players or shops. Money will not be so easily earned as you start out and pking is one of the ways you will gain your value from.  [/FONT][/CENTER][/ADMIN]
