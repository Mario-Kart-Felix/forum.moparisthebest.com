Hecadi is a server that has just launched, a lot of you may be thinking that it&#39;s not good enough or whatever, anyways i will be updating it daily because of my vacations, If you know me you know that there will be quality and unique updates, to be honest right now I haven&#39;t changed anything at all, but in this week i can be sure there will be alot of changes.

I already have a website running and just got the server running too.

Server Specs:
Intel processor 1 core 2.8ghz
2gb Ram
512 video card
It&#39;s not shared, or anything, the only thing running on the server is the game itself.

I&#39;ll be posting pictures real soon.</description>
