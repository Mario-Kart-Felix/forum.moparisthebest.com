    <description>Hey guys. i got this awesome server cache and client and i have been looking to make it public; i can&#39;t do the no-ip trick because i have a different gateway from what the videos show. is there a different way to get my server to the public without having to do all the no-ip and hamachi stuff? even possibly if i could just not make it on a webclient, but make it a downloadable public client (no idea how). 

Thanks for reading, any help is seriously appreciated.</description>
