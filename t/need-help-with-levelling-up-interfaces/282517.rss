    <description>I&#39;ve been wanting to make it so when you advance a level, it displays that little interface that says &quot;Congratulations, you have just advanced an Attack level!&quot;. I&#39;ve gotten the attack, strength, defence, hitpoints, magic, and a couple of others to work, but the others don&#39;t and it&#39;s confusing me as to why they aren&#39;t. I can get it to display the interface when you advance a level for every one of then, but the text doesn&#39;t appear. It appears as &#39;line1&#39; and &#39;line2&#39;, but it&#39;s confusing me. Here is the one for attack that does work:

[code]        case 0: // Attack
            sendFrame164(6247);
            stillgfx(199, absX, absY);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Congratulations, you have just advanced an attack level!&quot;, 6248);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Your Attack Level Is Now &quot; + playerLevel[0] + &quot;.&quot;, 6249);
            sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations, you have just advanced an attack level.&quot;);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            if (playerLevel[0] == 135) {
                sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations on level 135. Capes &amp; hoods are at the shops on the quest tab.&quot;);
            }
            break;[/code]

Now, I see that it says sendFrame164(6247);So then I followed the first message&#39;s id as 6248, then the seocnd as 6248 because the interface id is 6247. So it goes 6247, 6248, then 6249. That works. Here&#39;s my hitpoints one:

[code]        case 3: // Hitpoints
            sendFrame164(6216);
            stillgfx(199, absX, absY);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Congratulations, you have just advanced a hitpoints level!&quot;, 6217);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Your Hitpoints Level Is Now &quot; + playerLevel[3] + &quot;.&quot;, 6218);
            sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations, you have just advanced a hitpoints level.&quot;);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            if (playerLevel[3] == 135) {
                sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations on level 135. Capes &amp; hoods are at the shops on the quest tab.&quot;);
            }
            break;[/code]

Same idea; 6216, 6217, then 6218

But when I come to mining:

[code]        case 14: // Mining
             sendFrame164(4416);
             sendFrame126(&quot;Congratulations, you have just advanced a mining level!&quot;, 4417);
             sendFrame126(&quot;Your Mining Level Is Now &quot;+playerLevel[14]+&quot;.&quot;, 4418);
            sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations, you have just advanced a mining level.&quot;);
             NpcDialogueSend = true;
            if (playerLevel[14] == 135) {               
                sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations on level 135. Capes &amp; hoods are at the shops on the quest tab.&quot;);
            }
            break;[/code]

it&#39;ll display the first message, but not the second one.. Why is this?</description>
