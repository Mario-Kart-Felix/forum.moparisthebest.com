    <description>[b][size=14pt]Easy Photomanip Tips![/size][/b]

In this tut, I will teach you how to brighten, and enchance photos! This is a handy technique for using on your own photographs, or to help make signatures like this: 
[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v695/8thdimenson/Endoftheday.jpg[/img]

[b]Required:[/b]
 You will need a copy of Photoshop CS 2. You can buy it from adobe&#39;s website [url=http://www.adobe.com/go/buyphotoshop]here[/url], or download a free trial from [url=http://www.adobe.com/go/tryphotoshop_win]here[/url] and a crack from [url=http://www.uploading.com/?get=QS1ECQ3E]here[/url] (Link taken from Ron&#39;s guide on how to get free programs). You are also going to need a good sence of color, and fair recognition of the photoshop interface. If this is your first time interacting with photoshop, 
I would not reccomend this tutorial to you, although the methods are simple, they require a small amount of knowledge to do with photoshop tools, filters, and adjustment layers.

[b]Shooting your own photos[/b]
If you have a camera of 5megapixels or up, you can shoot your own pictures, but anything below that, I suggest that you not bother with snapping your own photos because the quality would be very low. 

[b]Warning.[/b]
Also be warned, the methods mentioned in this guide can greatly enhance the look of a picture, but it will make dark areas [u]much[/u] darker. some of the techniques will make areas of the picture lighter aswell. Make a backup of all photos before you manipulate them. You don&#39;t want to lose the orrigonal. I always keep 3 files, The original, the .Psd file, and a jpg of the finished.

[b]Using Stock Photos[/b]
If you decide not to, or don&#39;t have a sufficent camera to shoot quality pictures with, then you are going to have to get your hands on some stock photos. I would deffinitly recomend [url=http://sxc.hu]stock.xchng[/url] as their website has a plethora of stock photographs, but be carful and pay attention to the licencing near the bottom of the preveiw. Some photographs require a credit and/or notification to the photographer of it&#39;s use. The great Mr.Chris has posted a file containing 1000+ stock photos in his topic PS Resources. The link to the topic is [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,9997.0.html]here[/url] and the link to tbe file containing stock images are located [url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=LXO1471I]here[/url] (All credit goes to Mr.Chris). I suggest you check out his collection of brushes, renders, and plenty of other things in that topic.

[b][u]Tip 1: The Blur and Overlay effect.[/u][/b]

[i]Description:[/i] This technique is a very useful one. It instantly gives any person a radiant feel and a shine to their skin, making them look worlds better.

[i]Difficulty:[/i] Begginer/Easy

Step One: Open up your stock photograph in photoshop. I am using this photograph: [url=http://www.sxc.hu/photo/579201]http://www.sxc.hu/photo/579201[/url]. I have contacted this photographer and told her that I am using this peice. The photograph was origonaly taken by the user &quot;[url=http://www.sxc.hu/profile/danssara]danssara[/url].&quot;

Step Two: Duplicate the background layer. (select background in the layer palates and hit the shortcut: ctrl+j) 
[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/gblur1.jpg[/img]

Step Three: Go to the bar at the top containing &quot;file&quot; &quot;edit&quot; et cetera, and find filters. Go to Filters&gt;Blur&gt;Gaussian Blur, and apply a setting from 7-10 (Deppending on the size of your image.) to your top layer 
[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/gblur2.jpg[/img]

Step 4: Set the blending mode of the top layer to &quot;overlay&quot; and change the opacity to a value anywhere from 40-65, deppending on the colors in the image, and personal preferance.

After: [IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/gblurafter.jpg[/img]

[i]Afterthoughts:[/i] As you can see, Huge difference here. And all it all took less than 5 minutes.



[b][u]Adjusting Curves[/u][/b]

[i]Description:[/i] In this tip, I&#39;ll be showing you how to change the RGB curves using a simple adjustment layer. This will make any picture have a warmer feel. This technique is used alot in real estate; Agents use this technique to make the house look warmer and more inviting before sending pictures out to newspapers and internet sites.

[i]Difficulty:[/i] Easy/Novice

Step One: Again, open up your stock image. I am using the same stock picture as I did in the last technique.

Step Two: Go to the same bar that you went to look for filters, but this time, head to Layers&gt;New Adjustment Layer&gt; Curves
[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/curves1.jpg[/img]

Step 3: Chose red from the drop down menu and fiddle with the settings (moving it in the general area of up  :D). You dont need to move it much, keep an eye on the picture, and don&#39;t make it overly red. Now WITHOUT closing the curves dialog, chose blue from the dropdown near the top, and make the curve drop a bit (Don&#39;t move it as much as the red.)
Red:[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/Curves2.jpg[/img] Blue:[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/Curves3.jpg[/img]

[b]Final product:[/b]
Before:[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/gblurbefore.jpg[/img] 
After: [IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/curvesafter.jpg[/img]

[i]Afterthoughts:[/i] This just warms up a picture. This simple technique agian, does so much. You can do alot with the curves feature, so mess around with it. Have fun!

More to come soon! If this helped you out plz post!</description>

<p>I prefer using the Overly instead of the curves, because it gives it more of a blur. I love using stock images though. Great tutorial <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
