    <title>Googlewhack&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/googlewhacks/220425</link>
    <description>Anyone know what these are? If not i will explain to you. Basically a googlwhack is something you serch on google with 1 result here are the rules for Googlewhacks
&lt;blockquote&gt;What? What?!  
Visit [URL=http://www.google.com]Google[/URL]. Submit a query of two words, but don&#39;t use quote marks. (Quotes tell Google to find the enclosed words immediately adjacent - and that&#39;s just too easy!) Use no punctuation in your words, and no numbers (just 26 letters from A through Z). Find two words that return one result, then see whether Whack agrees (Whack may not see the same results you see). Whack only accepts words between 4 and 30 characters in length. (Any shorter or longer, again, that&#39;s just too easy!) 
[u]What are the rules?[/u]  
[b]Rule Number One: [/b] Your two Googlefactors must exist in Google&#39;s view of legitimate words in this [URL=http://www.answers.com/]dictionary[/URL]. Not your view; Google&#39;s view! Google does the work, and Google has the final word on what may be legitimate! In the blue bar atop your Google results, accepted terms are linked, and so appear &#39;underlined.&#39; No line, no link, or no legitimate word = Googlejack! (As in, You&#39;ve got jack, so see the FAQ :-) 

[b]Rule Number Two:[/b] Google also is the arbiter of a whack&#39;s uniqueness. Look to the right end of the blue bar atop your Google results. If you see &quot;Results 1 - 1 of (any number),&#39; you found exactly one hit = Googlewhack! 

[b]Rule Number Three:[/b] Google shows you an excerpt of the page you whacked. Look at that text. If it&#39;s merely a list of words (such as a bibliography, concordance, encyclopedia, glossary, thesaurus, dictionary, domain names, or plain old machine-generated random garbage), No Whack For You! 

If your Googlefactors don&#39;t comply, some other whacker will certainly test them, then expose your treachery to all! 
Entries in The Whack Stack that breach Rule Number Three will be marked WORDLIST :-(. 

If you record offensive comments in The Whack Stack, I may remove or change them at my discretion. 

Excessive stacking of the same word may cause Whack to ban the word automatically for over 48 hours. 

Inappropriate use or abuse of the service may result in your whacks being removed. Deal with it. 

&quot;Inappropriate use or abuse&quot; may include the use of tokens which are not legitimate words. 

When complaints or comments point to inappropriate use, Whack&#39;s behavior may change without notice. 


Note: When you search Google, you may be able to find more reliable Googlewhacks by prefixing each word in your Google search with a &quot;+&quot; (for example, +endothelial +velveeta). It&#39;s not required, but may make whacking easier. Whack always has submitted queries that require an exact match. That is, Whack always has prefixed both words with &quot;+&quot; to require their presence, which (later, serendipitously) also avoided any stemming by Google. The rules here always have been correct; entries in The Whack Stack always have been consistent with the rules. 

You&#39;re welcome to post your crack Googlewhack in The Whack Stack. To do so, first head over to Google to find a whack you like. Then, you can use [URL=http://www.googlewhack.com/hello.htm]Whack![/URL], which checks the rules for you! (It will record a true success, but if you find more than a few results, it will send you to Google where you belong :-) 

If you can&#39;t satisfy Whack!, you&#39;re welcome to post your slightly slack Googlewhack to QuickTopic. (This is especially for those hardcore Scrabble players who just know &quot;That&#39;s a real word,&quot; even though Google&#39;s reference may not agree :-) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
So there you go, now you can find some and submit them for the world to see, but once you submit one it won&#39;t be a googlewhack anymore because it will be posted on various sites etc so guard it closely until you decide to submit. But remember it must adhere to the rules.
Here is a link to their [URL=http://www.googlewhack.com/fhack.htm]FAQ site[/URL] just in case you are confused</description>

yeah but it does, because if its found on one site other sites add it aswell and forums have it etc so basically it does get put up again</p>
