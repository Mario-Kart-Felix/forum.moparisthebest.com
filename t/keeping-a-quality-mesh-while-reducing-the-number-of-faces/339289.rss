    <title>Keeping a quality mesh, while reducing the number of faces?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/keeping-a-quality-mesh-while-reducing-the-number-of-faces/339289</link>
    <description>i need help on this topic, when i make a model i go over board on the detail, which ends up costing me to have a large number of faces, now i was looking through some mesh from oblivion and they seem to have very few faces and when i do a smooth preview it is of good quality. does any modeling expert here know how this can be done.

i am a maya user, but i guess it would apply to any program.</description>
