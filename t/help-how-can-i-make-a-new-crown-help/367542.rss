    <title>[HELP] How can I make a new crown? [HELP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-how-can-i-make-a-new-crown-help/367542</link>
    <description>I am not 100% sure if this goes here, but I believe this is client sided and I need help with this. Can someone show me how to get to or explain to me how to add a new custom dollar sign for respected donator? Currently I have the &quot;donator == 1&quot; crown (which is a Red Dollar Sign) - I would like to add respected donator &quot;donator == 2&quot; can someone explain to me how to do this? I am not sure how to add it into the client/server :(. Please no flaming. Feel free to add me on msn or email me! Soul_reaper1994@hotmail.com</description>
