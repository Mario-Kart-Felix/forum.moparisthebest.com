    <title>Client that works with DS source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-that-works-with-ds-source/329092</link>
    <description>I need a client that will work with DeltaScape&#39;s server source. All the ones I have tried just disconnect me. I have tried DeltaScape Client v4, v11, and PKJAD Scape&#39;s client. Please post a download link for a client that will work, or if you believe one of those versions I have tried should work I will retry and post results. I may also be doing something wrong. Another thing is that I&#39;m connecting to localhost or 127.0.0.1. Thank you for your time.</description>

              <p>Where? I tried v4 and v11 and they didn’t work. What happens is I log in and it logs in and everything. The only thing is that the screen stays black for say 20-30 secs. And then it kicks me off. When I try logging in under the same account it says This account is already logged in. Please try again in 60 seconds.</p>
