    <title>How would i make a player drop 50k or so when he/she is killed?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-make-a-player-drop-50k-or-so-when-he-she-is-killed/302964</link>
    <description>Someone help? I&#39;ve used google... used the search bar... looked on YouTube... And even tried things myself. What more can i do?

I need help making a player drop 50k/100k when killed. The amount doesn&#39;t really matter... It doesn&#39;t matter if he drops it when killed by a monster, either. I just want him to drop 50k when he&#39;s either pked or just anytime he/she&#39;s killed.

If someone could help.. Thank you.</description>

<p>Find your drop method and add the drop of 50 coins. Most drop methods already contain a statement that drops bones on default. Just follow the format of that statement.</p>

<p>I’m assuming i should search Client.Java, but what do i search? I’ll try DeathMethod… Is that what i should search?</p>
