          <blockquote>
              <p>Look for a file called <span class="bbcode-i">autospawn.cfg</span>. Then it will have a list looking something like this (Note: I only post the first 2 npcâ€™s.)</p>
<p><code>//------NpcID---CoordX--CoordY--Height--RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-Descrption
spawn = 2821	3093	3506	0	0	0	0	0	1	Zeke
spawn = 1596	3306	9379	0	0	0	0	0	1	PK rewards</code><br>
They may be different for you but this is a general tutorial. You can change where Zeke is standing by changing CoordX and CoordY. You can find these by logging out and going into character files and finding the coordinates. Another ways is some games have it displayed in the settings icon.</p>
<p>But, maybe you want to create a new train. There are 2 ways to find out an npc.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In-game you will see the npc and if you right click it should give you the NpcID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can open up <span class="bbcode-i">npc.cfg</span> and search the name of the npc. You can also change the hp of the npc but more importantly, find the NpcID.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this has helped <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
