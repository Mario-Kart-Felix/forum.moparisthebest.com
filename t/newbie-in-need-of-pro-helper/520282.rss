    <description>Hey guys.

well i might start off saying that im pretty much a noob with java but im working on it and trying my best to learn it asap.

The reason why i made this topic is cuz im trying to make a test server, with the 562 and i found this amazing one that i rly want to get working on but now i was wondering if i could get some help with the problems im having with it :)

Short info:

26-1-13: Started canoes.
26-1-13: Added a lot of more NPC spawns to real locations (over 80).
26-1-13: Fixed Dragon Scimitar + Korasi&#39;s Sword attack animations and maul animations.
26-1-13: Started advanced character creation system.
26-1-13: Spirit tree teleportation, corrected it and it&#39;s fully finished.
27-1-13: Finished Player Safety -exams (Questions, rewarding, handling).
27-1-13: Finished Experience lamps, antique lamps and so on. (Has media about it.)
28-1-13: Explorer jack is complete (Guy who gives some little tasks for newcomers).
28-1-13: Added Varrock museum display cases including a system for Kudos.
28-1-13: Warning system started, i&#39;m planning to start 2011 tutorial system also.
29-1-13: Finished warning toggling and un-toggling system, it&#39;s perfected and fully done.
29-1-13: Added buckets + fillables and emptying.
29-1-13: Added more World NPC and animated over 90 new npcs.
29-1-13: Added dialogues, most of lumbridge has about 80% dialogues.
09-1-13: Completed more dialogues, lumbridge contains 95% of all dialogues.
09-1-13: Nearly 100% player dueling.
+ Some more i didn&#39;t list also this contains most of Dementhium features.
