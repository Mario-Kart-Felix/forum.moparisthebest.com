    <title>Command to make &#39;fake players.&#39;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/command-to-make-fake-players/390823</link>
    <description>I know &#39;fake players&#39; don&#39;t act like real players, or send the same amount of packets, but i want to test how much my server can hold,

So could someone tell me how to do this&amp; answer this Question, 
okay lets say i have 50k &#39;Fake Players&#39; how many real players would that be equivalent to?</description>

Yes, it is. I have a 614 with a command to log in 2k players. I’m not on pc so I can post tomorrow and it doesn’t make it look like there’s people on. They just sit there swinging their arms cuz that’s what revision 500+ characters do lol.</p>
