    <title>My Current Project - Need some Opinions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-current-project-need-some-opinions/296254</link>
    <description>Well, with me being in school, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about Math (Seeing how I&#39;m the best at Algebra 1 in my class), and an idea hit me. I could make a program that will solve all sorts of algebra problems, along with showing the work. Here&#39;s where you guys come in.

Oh, and if you don&#39;t support this program or have anything negative to say about it or me, then just gtfo.

I probably wouldn&#39;t be using this, because it&#39;d be faster just to do it in my head. But, it&#39;s something to do and C++/DirectX is getting on my nerves right now.

Anyways, I need suggestions on what would make it look best. It&#39;ll be supporting variables, using the Order of Operations, etc... But, to make it most user-friendly and best-looking, I don&#39;t know. Something I want to avoid is a plain text box and a result. I&#39;m looking for something that maybe has tabs, and makes the math problem flexible.

Thanks,

~Lin</description>

              <p>Hey Guys! I am in the eigth grade and I love math. I am currently in Algebra (Could of been in Algebra 1 if I got an A, but I had to get a B+) and I was wondering how you guys make programs for your TI-84s.  Also Lin Like you are in your class I am the best in mine, and I think this program will be great. If you can get this to work I can show it to all the retards in my grade and they will finaly learn. Soo keep up the good work and can’t waite for it to be finished.</p>

When I was a Junior, last year, I wrote a program using the TI-84 (I think) that did stuff like area/peremiter/volume/py theroem/and another one I can’t seem to remember, althogh I should. It took input from the user, and it was an amazing tool to use during tests <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>So yeah, I would suggest using an advanced calculator, so you can “cheat” without your teacher knowing.<br>

<p>Lool, when I was in geometry last year, I was writing a lot of TI-83 programs too. I made a program that would reduce radicals to their lowest forms, it was hawt. Then I had a bunch of other Geometrical and Trigonometrical programs to help me out on tests and stuff.[/quote]</p>
<p>They really do come in handy on exams, tests, etc.</p>

Get a graphics calculator, and make ‘programs’ in them. They normally have an actual menu and shit so you make them on the calculator, then run them.</p>

              <p>When I was a Junior, last year, I wrote a program using the TI-84 (I think) that did stuff like area/peremiter/volume/py theroem/and another one I can’t seem to remember, althogh I should. It took input from the user, and it was an amazing tool to use during tests <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>So yeah, I would suggest using an advanced calculator, so you can “cheat” without your teacher knowing.</p>

              <p>Well, with me being in school, I’ve been thinking a lot about Math (Seeing how I’m the best at Algebra 1 in my class), and an idea hit me. I could make a program that will solve all sorts of algebra problems, along with showing the work. Here’s where you guys come in.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you don’t support this program or have anything negative to say about it or me, then just gtfo.</p>
<p>I probably wouldn’t be using this, because it’d be faster just to do it in my head. But, it’s something to do and C++/DirectX is getting on my nerves right now.</p>
<p>Anyways, I need suggestions on what would make it look best. It’ll be supporting variables, using the Order of Operations, etc… But, to make it most user-friendly and best-looking, I don’t know. Something I want to avoid is a plain text box and a result. I’m looking for something that maybe has tabs, and makes the math problem flexible.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
