    <description>Ok, i wanna know, how do i set the mods/admins/donators.
I wanna change the Owner to myself, not the guy already set, i did it before in my 508 a while back, dont remember how now.
I also wanna know, how do i add/change npc shops, where is that located?
Also, where is the file for the npcs, like where they spawn etc...</description>

              <p>Well, based on how you worded your question, I’ll assume that you know the name of the “guy” who’s already set as an owner. Simply replace that name with yours?</p>
<p>For adding shops, Google. There are many tutorials, <a href="http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/tutorials/260099-pi-how-add-your-own-shops.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>’s one for instance.</p>
<p>NPC spawns are most likely handled in a configuration file, just look for a folder named config/cfg/configuration/etc.</p>
