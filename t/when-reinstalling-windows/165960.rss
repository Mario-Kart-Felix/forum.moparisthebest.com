    <title>When reinstalling Windows</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/when-reinstalling-windows/165960</link>
    <description>When you&#39;re reinstalling Windows like I did, make sure you let the computer know what you have. For example, I use a USB Port mouse, but when I reinstalled Windows it was detecting no mouse and something from the keyboard, making it unable to startup. I&#39;ve known some people with this issue, so I&#39;m just stating. Also, you can change it by when starting up you goto &#39;Setup&#39;. I couldn&#39;t use my computer for months because of this.

Just posting this so if people ever reinstall Windows, that this would be a problem if your computer was detecting hardware that wasn&#39;t there ;)
