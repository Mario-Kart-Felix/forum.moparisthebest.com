    <title>Pre-EOC Servers</title>

    <description>Since Jagex is going to (mosy likely) release an 07&#39; server the market for that type of server is saturated and now dead. We need a new market to work from. There seems to br a large group of players who enjoy post 07&#39; up to before EOC. I think thats the point where people should invest their develipmenta into now. Especially if you want to get big.</description>

              <p>I’m into good graphics and not really a fan of pre-HD, even though I played before they started using HD. I don’t know why, but I like how the 508/525 servers looked (with HD and the Grand Exchange). I have not really seen any 508/525 servers (that aren’t leech to all hell) lately, I could be mistaken, but I don’t look at top server lists like on RuneLocus that much.</p>
