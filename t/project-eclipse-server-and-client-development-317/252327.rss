    <description>[center]Hello and welcome to my Server and Client Development.  Please keep any flaming or bad comments to yourself.  I have been working on my server and client for about 2 months.  During this time I changed a lot and cleaned the files.  I&#39;m not that experienced at coding but I think that my source is pretty good so far.  Well enjoy.[/center]

[center]Features: -Server Sided
6 quests (two done so far)
Barrows Minigame (in development)
Assault Minigame (a high level one and a low level one so everyone can play)
Godwars with Zilyana - get 40 kills and kill her for rare items, the monsters also drop items too
My custom partyhat minigame
Client.java is fairly clean, only 499kb
Texthandler.java
BuryItem.java - for potions and food (working on potions like strength and defence)
Helm bug fixed
A lot of NPC Dialogues
Lumbridge and Varrock actually are filled with NPCS
Shopping Area (haven&#39;t started yet)
Gnome Glider System - you buy a pass for 20000 coins and then you can fly to the areas he offers you.
A portal room (haven&#39;t started yet because my object click is fucked up)
Most NPC&#39;s talk
All Normal and Ancient magic teleports work - Normal magic teleport to varrock, lumbridge, ect  but Ancient teleports to minigames and ect.
Working on Lunar Magic to actually work (just basic stuff, plank make, Humidify, teleports and such)
You can&#39;t do anything until you have completed the training quests, very easy
Steady Economy
Buy X for shops
Has a starter but it doesn&#39;t give something like 900m and about 2000 other items.
Quest point system
Working Prayer (runescapes current prayer)
And much more![/center]

[center]Features: -Client Sided
Buy X
Lunar Interface
Prayer Interface
Clan Chat Interface
Multi-way Icon
Fixed Deltascape fence helms
Fixed Delta prayer sprite
Client has JFrame and JMenus including color Themes, quit, Noclip, about, and FPS
JFrame color changed to black
Clean Game frame (I think its a 474 not sure)
Changed scroll bar icon from Deltascapes normal
Removed a bunch of useless items in Class8
There is more but I can&#39;t remember what I put in lol
More to come though![/center]


Soooo sound interesting? I bet so.  I was planning on releasing a beta test for people to test out but I don&#39;t want to release my source yet. I want to make it into a Exe file but I don&#39;t know how to.  

I will be adding picture and maybe a video in a little bit, be warned though because I suck at taking photos.  Thanks for viewing though and please again NO flaming.  Adios Amigos.</description>
