    <description>hey.
i cant seem to get on to dodian, its saying to many connections from ur address.
when i really only just opened and got no other connections....
i tryed restarting my computer, turning off my internet and reconecting.
it wont work...
after a while i left the server and went to enkrona.
i went back after half an hour and it said invalid user name and password.
so i make up a new account like im a new player,
so i log in and get to around lvl 50, then it laags and logs me out.
i try and log back in and it sais my account is already logged in...
i try my other account and it says to many connections from your address...
