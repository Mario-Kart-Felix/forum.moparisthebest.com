    <title>Coords for Shadow of the Storm quest?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/coords-for-shadow-of-the-storm-quest/431734</link>
    <description>Title says it all, I need the coords for shadow of the storm quest, the red with black area with those pillars. You know what i&#39;m talking about if you did the quest on real RS.

I have a coords list with alot of places added in it and i tried alot of them but I can&#39;t find it :&lt; I have found a place that looks like it but it&#39;s not red and black-ish..

Anyone knows?</description>
