    <description>Hello, i currently run a 317 Delta server. I want to add cats. I want to make it so you can drop a Item (example:hell cat, 7582)
and it turn into a Npc that follows you around, and only you can pick it up. (like in runescape pets). Any help on this would be awsome, i looked for a tutorial but could not find one. If you have one or know one that will help i would love the link :) plz help</description>
