    <title>Java/DeltaScape help needed</title>

    <description>I&#39;m using a DeltaScape source, and it works fine on my computer.

The problem is i&#39;ve recently bought a VPS from Xlhost (operating system Windows 2003), and when I run.bat on the VPS I get the following error.

The CMD window flashes up for less than a second, showing this error;

[code]Error occured during initialization of VM
java/lang/NoClassDefFoundError: java/lang/Object[/code]

I have tried very hard to fix this, but have had no luck as of so far.

Edit: I&#39;ve noticed I have some rep++ to use, so whoever helps me fix this I will rep++.  ;)

Thanks alot for your time,
