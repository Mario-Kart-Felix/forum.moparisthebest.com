    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-the-server/422510</link>
    <description>Hi guys Ive been playing Runescape private servers for around 2 years now.
I really want to create my own, but Im having major problems.
I got winrar, Java JDk, source and client. But I dont know how to make it run.
Can someone plz help me out with that part? It would really be appreciated.

Im also trying to learn more about computers, since the future seems to be getting mroe focused in Technology.

I have skype, and I can download that one thing that lets other people access my computer

^^^ Im a noob I know..

Thanks for the help in advance.</description>
