    <title>[718 - TPP] Normal/Curses - NPC&#39;s not hitting through Prayer? :C</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-tpp-normal-curses-npcs-not-hitting-through-prayer-c/551130</link>
    <description>As the title says none of the NPC&#39;s hit through Prayer, so when i make new bosses and finish them, its always people standing there grinding them because they do not hit anything, i have even taken off the aggro to make sure its not &#39;&#39;AFK&#39;&#39; able but since they dont hit anything through prayer people can go and kill them with a full inv of restore Flasks...

Soo now im pretty fed up with it so i want them to HIT through prayer but since im a newbie/novice coder i was in need for some help from the community :D 

If there is anyfiles i need to Quote i will gladly do it&lt;3</description>
