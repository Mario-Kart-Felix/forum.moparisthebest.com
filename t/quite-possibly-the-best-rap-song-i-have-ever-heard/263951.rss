    <description>Oliver Hart (eyedea)  - Step by Step
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xz9OXdnS74&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=00275877C91DA2CC&amp;playnext=1&amp;index=3

I thoroughly enjoyed this. Read the lyrics if you can&#39;t catch everything, and pay attention :D
 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I got a little story to tell
See it was September 1st, 1999, the day of my death
My back was on the cold concrete as I take my last breath
Saw my body laying on the ground as my soul hovered above me
Damn Eyedea you was a good lookin&#39; cat
But anyway another day at 18 years of age
Step in heaven&#39;s gate anxious to see what God got to say
Maybe he&#39;ll give me a gift for always saying my prayers
But he might send me downstairs for last year&#39;s love affair
Well who cares
You know right now it&#39;s all a mystery
I mean I&#39;ll find out when I get there
Until then I can&#39;t let it get to me
I&#39;m keepin&#39; my cool
Besides everybody dies
I&#39;ll just follow the white light like the do in the movies

It seems like I was went by and I&#39;m still travelin
Right towards the brightness 
Now this ain&#39;t heaven of hell
This realm is lifeless
And I hate to say it 
But this wild goose chase had me bored
No directions, no clues, no idea what I was in for
But forward I kept floating 
And then a quick flash the lights split directly in half
And created a forked path
Representing each side is an angel
Now whats the task I have to untangle to meet the big man in charge I ask
And one on the right of me says one of us always lies and one that always tells the truth
Ask the right one the right question he&#39;ll direct you to heaven 
If ask the wrong one son, farwell you going straight to well....
Y&#39;all get the picture

The one on my left told me not to listen to his fibs
He said it ain&#39;t that complicated to find out where god lives
He told me to follow his path 
and tell god that he said hi
Then the one on my right jumped in and told me not to believe his lies
and I&#39;m like Jesus fucking Christ
I didn&#39;t care much for life 
But I&#39;ve tried to stay alive forever if I knew this is what death was like
I was never good at problem solving especially in emergencies
I get a tad bit nervous when concerned with burning for eternity
but anyway I asked them which one lied and they pointed at each other
Thinking I&#39;d had it I asked the name of my mother
One said he don&#39;t know the other said he know but he can&#39;t tell me
God damn this is going to be hard

So I asked 30 questions and I still wasn&#39;t sure
but being me I gave those pricks a few good words
Frustrated with it all 
I turned my back to the angels and when I walked away to my surprise 
I found myself in heaven

(Ya know I&#39;m saying 
Kinda just turned around from the whole situation 
Rejecting everything that was going on 
Thats how I walked into heaven)

I Walked away, walked away, walked straight into heaven...
I Walked away, walked away, walked straight into heaven...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you enjoyed this as much as I did, download more from them. Search around for eyedea &amp; abilities. I don&#39;t know if I can go back to rock after this :P</description>

<p>Eyedea &amp; abilities is pretty underground for the most part. Not as much anymore. I like this rapper for different reasons then I would like a rapper such as eminem. I listen to a variety of rap though. Lots of hip hop I like because it sounds good, but the lyrics are still terrible. (and I listen to oldschool rap…)</p>

<p>Man this guy is a genious really.<br>
You kinda have to hear the lyrics from the begining to the end.</p>
<blockquote>http://ha ha... ha ha... ha ha… it is kind of a funny story
He lives in a four by two glass box
It reminds me of my head
I wish my floor would have rocks, 
But it's covered with puddles instead
If I could be him, life would be great
I could erase this permanent frown
I wouldn't even be held down by my own weight
I woke up walked to the tank to hear his thoughts on yesterday
How was it? I asked
And after a tap on the glass
He looked my way, then gave me this depressed expression
Impressed, it's best just to say
Besides the tides and the grey skies, it was okay
And I said Hey mister fish you get all that you wish
You've got, nothin' to complain about while hangin' out in this bitch
Well he replied, While existence is bliss, there's so much that you miss
Besides get off the trip, happiness is just a myth.
I said Livin' in water is extremely more peaceful than
Life confined to a mind, blinded by the evil
And forced to see through these two peep holes
It seems I’ve redeemed freedom, not being limited by walls but 
That only means I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls 
That only means I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls 
That only means I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls 
That only means I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls
But Mr. Fish just laughed as I went on and on and on
So I interrupted his chuckle, puttin’ up a middle finger
And he boldly told me it's too bad I'm such a thinker
So arrogantly I asked, How could someone think too much?
He added that insanity lingers and thoughts brought me to the brink of such
He said, You live inside a head that reminds me of my glass box
And everyone's the same; all brains are contained by your reality framed
And chained, to with the rain, its trained hard not to change
And once you see what I've explained you hit the jackpot
And at that very moment it was like my eyes really opened
The air that previously surrounded me was now an ocean
Still totally invisible except for minor pieces of debris
Then Mr. Fish pushed up to the glass and he looked just like me
My whole world spun around, I didn't understand
But I realized I was no longer a man
So I thought about what he said
And asked him what was going on
And he said, you didn't know it but you where the fish all along
He said, congratulations, you did it, you broke free
You're just a fish like the rest of humanity
Now it took me a long time to get adjusted to this tank
But now I know what I am, and so to that man I give thanks
I've always lived inside this glass box that reminds him of his head
It just goes to show ya that your mind is your own monster
Reality's what you make it, if you take it away
You’re just a fish, like me, swimming in the powdered water</blockquote>
<p>You were the fish all along!!! so sick</p>
          </blockquote>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this. Read the lyrics if you can’t catch everything, and pay attention <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<blockquote>I got a little story to tell
See it was September 1st, 1999, the day of my death
My back was on the cold concrete as I take my last breath
Saw my body laying on the ground as my soul hovered above me
Damn Eyedea you was a good lookin' cat
But anyway another day at 18 years of age
Step in heaven's gate anxious to see what God got to say
Maybe he'll give me a gift for always saying my prayers
But he might send me downstairs for last year's love affair
Well who cares
You know right now it's all a mystery
I mean I'll find out when I get there
Until then I can't let it get to me
I'm keepin' my cool
Besides everybody dies
I'll just follow the white light like the do in the movies
<p>It seems like I was went by and I’m still travelin<br>
Right towards the brightness<br>
Now this ain’t heaven of hell<br>
This realm is lifeless<br>
And I hate to say it<br>
But this wild goose chase had me bored<br>
No directions, no clues, no idea what I was in for<br>
But forward I kept floating<br>
And then a quick flash the lights split directly in half<br>
And created a forked path<br>
Representing each side is an angel<br>
Now whats the task I have to untangle to meet the big man in charge I ask<br>
And one on the right of me says one of us always lies and one that always tells the truth<br>
Ask the right one the right question he’ll direct you to heaven<br>
If ask the wrong one son, farwell you going straight to well…<br>
Y’all get the picture</p>
<p>The one on my left told me not to listen to his fibs<br>
He said it ain’t that complicated to find out where god lives<br>
He told me to follow his path<br>
and tell god that he said hi<br>
Then the one on my right jumped in and told me not to believe his lies<br>
and I’m like Jesus fucking Christ<br>
I didn’t care much for life<br>
But I’ve tried to stay alive forever if I knew this is what death was like<br>
I was never good at problem solving especially in emergencies<br>
I get a tad bit nervous when concerned with burning for eternity<br>
but anyway I asked them which one lied and they pointed at each other<br>
Thinking I’d had it I asked the name of my mother<br>
One said he don’t know the other said he know but he can’t tell me<br>
God damn this is going to be hard</p>
<p>So I asked 30 questions and I still wasn’t sure<br>
but being me I gave those pricks a few good words<br>
Frustrated with it all<br>
I turned my back to the angels and when I walked away to my surprise<br>
I found myself in heaven</p>
<p>(Ya know I’m saying<br>
Kinda just turned around from the whole situation<br>
Rejecting everything that was going on<br>
Thats how I walked into heaven)</p>
<p>I Walked away, walked away, walked straight into heaven…<br>
I Walked away, walked away, walked straight into heaven…</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this as much as I did, download more from them. Search around for eyedea &amp; abilities. I don’t know if I can go back to rock after this <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
