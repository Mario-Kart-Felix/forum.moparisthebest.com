And in what other realm of multi-million dollar machines may be the “boss” 22 years old?Within Squad 2, 22-year-old Cpl. Chips Poderick, from San Diego, Calif., may be the boss. When he talks, the others listen. His or her lives are in his palms.Asked if that would have been a lot of responsibility for a 22-year-old kid, Poderick replied, "Yeah, bringing a bunch of 19-year-olds home, places a lot of weight on your shoulders. And it’s alright – that’s what I opted in for."Cpl. Poderick says the first thing he or she wants to do whilst gets home is take his mom and 2 younger sisters out to dinner. Before Baghdad he says, "I never thought that way."For all of Squad 2, living has changed in these last few weeks. Boys read about history. Men make it.  <a href="http://monsterbeats235.labeautesalonandspa.com/2013/05/29/beat-dre-pro/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">beat dre pro</a><br>
