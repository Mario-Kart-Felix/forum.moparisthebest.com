    <title>Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; (at NPCHandler)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/exception-in-thread-main-at-npchandler/431569</link>
    <description>Hello Moparscape! I don&#39;t usually ask for help here so I hope I&#39;m not breaking any rules. I&#39;ve checked the guidelines and if I&#39;ve missed anything please let me know. 

My buddies and I are in the process of working on our own private server to just have some casual fun on, and then I went to edit something (at approx. 3 in the morning) and I compiled it. I do not exactly remember what it was that I did, but if someone could please clarify what is wrong with the code that would be greatly appreciated. I&#39;ve looked around in NPCHandler and went to the loadNPCDrops area it is talking about, but I still cannot figure it out. This is in the run-server screen. When I compile I get no errors, either. I think I should also add that I haven&#39;t worked with RSPS in almost three years.

<p>It is in a specific manner that you need to add them into it.[/quote]</p>
<p>like what he said, use this as an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int[] example { "234234", "23456", "23457", "3462" }</code></pre>
<p>it has to have quotes, then a comma and a space in each one.</p>
