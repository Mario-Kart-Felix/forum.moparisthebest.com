Need 
Advertiser - takes care of all advertising, Banner modifying, voting sites, etc.

Second developer - Lots of things need added need help doing so, Preferably you know a decent amount about clients. but if you don&#39;t its okay because I need lots of things in game added / fixed.
Client Developer - If second developer doesn&#39;t know clients, then this person will be found.

Website developer / maintainer - everything to do with website is controlled by this person. Layout, Forums, auto vote, auto donate(in future), highscores. Everything. I have added all the basics, I need someone to take it all to the next level.

Currently we have
Head Developer / Owner - Durky
