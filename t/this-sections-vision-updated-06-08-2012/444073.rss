    <title>This section&#39;s vision [Updated 06/08/2012]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-sections-vision-updated-06-08-2012/444073</link>
    <description>This section exists to allow users to have private conversations with moderators. The following are our expected categories of discussion:


[ul][li]Suggestions to the site[/li]
[li]Nominating somebody to a certain position or to receive a certain badge[/li]
[li]Discuss a moderator&#39;s actions in a certain instance with that moderator and the rest of the staff[/li]
[li]Critique the way the staff does things[/li][/ul]


Up until now, all of the above had to be done publicly, were disallowed, or had to be done private via personal messages. This is no longer the case. If you have any concerns whatsoever with this website, you can post it here. All posts in this section are [b]hidden[/b] from the rest of the community, except for the staff. You will have a private discussion with staff members only. In cases of suggestions, great ones will be publicized and polled so the entire community can discuss them. Otherwise, what&#39;s private with you remains private with us.

This section is also for requesting that your websites be approved, but please read the other sticky for that. Also, if you abuse this section, you will be disallowed from posting in it.

[b]Update (05 June 2012): [/b]Self-nominations for ranks or badges are not allowed. It&#39;s fine to nominate others, but not yourself. We have a very selective process for choosing members and, during self-nomination, there is no way to actually discuss the possibilities with the person nominating. This thereby defeats the purpose of this board and may lead to other issues.

[b]Update (08 June 2012): [/b]We are employing a &quot;three-day&quot; rule in order to keep this board moving as quickly as possible. To put it simply, a moderator may or may not reply to your topic. Your topic does not apply to this rule if a moderator doesn&#39;t reply. In that case, just post again. I&#39;ve enabled all regular users to double post in this section. Now, the rule goes as follows: the most popular opinion of the moderators after three days is the one that will be picked. If a moderator is requesting some more information from the user and the user does not reply after three days, the topic will be resolved and moved to the expired section. Finally, if the moderators are unsure about a decision, the topic will remain in this section until a settlement is reached. If you need to repost an expired suggestion, go ahead. As long as you don&#39;t abuse this board, we&#39;ll have no problems.

Thanks!

<p>how am i supposed to have my fun… ?</p>
<p>in seriousness though, this one is a good idea. about time there’s a system that allows people to suggest users that the moderators may not have picked up on. sort of takes the politics out of it all.</p>
<p>well done.</p>

<p>There have been a few others. If you think it should be made public, post a topic about it in this section. It’s definitely a popular enough idea that it’d probably go public with the community.</p>

              <p>This section exists to allow users to have private conversations with moderators. The following are our expected categories of discussion:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Suggestions to the site[/li]<br>
[li]Nominating somebody to a certain position or to receive a certain badge[/li]<br>
[li]Discuss a moderator’s actions in a certain instance with that moderator and the rest of the staff[/li]<br>
[li]Critique the way the staff does things[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Up until now, all of the above had to be done publicly, were disallowed, or had to be done private via personal messages. This is no longer the case. If you have any concerns whatsoever with this website, you can post it here. All posts in this section are <span class="bbcode-b">hidden</span> from the rest of the community, except for the staff. You will have a private discussion with staff members only. In cases of suggestions, great ones will be publicized and polled so the entire community can discuss them. Otherwise, what’s private with you remains private with us.</p>
<p>This section is also for requesting that your websites be approved, but please read the other sticky for that. Also, if you abuse this section, you will be disallowed from posting in it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Update (05 June 2012): </span>Self-nominations for ranks or badges are not allowed. It’s fine to nominate others, but not yourself. We have a very selective process for choosing members and, during self-nomination, there is no way to actually discuss the possibilities with the person nominating. This thereby defeats the purpose of this board and may lead to other issues.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Update (08 June 2012): </span>We are employing a “three-day” rule in order to keep this board moving as quickly as possible. To put it simply, a moderator may or may not reply to your topic. Your topic does not apply to this rule if a moderator doesn’t reply. In that case, just post again. I’ve enabled all regular users to double post in this section. Now, the rule goes as follows: the most popular opinion of the moderators after three days is the one that will be picked. If a moderator is requesting some more information from the user and the user does not reply after three days, the topic will be resolved and moved to the expired section. Finally, if the moderators are unsure about a decision, the topic will remain in this section until a settlement is reached. If you need to repost an expired suggestion, go ahead. As long as you don’t abuse this board, we’ll have no problems.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>MoparScape Staff</p>
