    <title>&quot;Item has been dropped&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/item-has-been-dropped/284790</link>
    <description>Well, I am in a hurry, so I don&#39;t really know what to post. I saw this in a source awhile back. When an item is dropped, it sends the message to everybody saying, &quot;Blah has been dropped&quot;. I need a method that will do that, or any ideas that can construct it. Basically I just need a kick and I can do the rest. Any ideas? Obviously it is in the NPCHandler class. I feel really stupid asking something like this, but that&#39;s okay.  :)</description>

              <p>Brainstorming, you could probably use the getItemName method along with a switch statement for the dropped item.</p>

              <p>Oops, I misread what you said. What _™ suggested will work.<br>
I can’t think of a reason for you to use a switch statement though.</p>
