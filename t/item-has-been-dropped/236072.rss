    <title>-Item- Has been dropped</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/item-has-been-dropped/236072</link>
    <description>Well, currently I am editing some bosses and I want to make it so if there is a certain Item, such as a BGS, it will say:

BGS was dropped by the  ----

I already have the monster name, I just need to know how to announce it...

Ths is the code i completely pulled out of my ass:

[code]                           if (npcs[NPCID].npcType == 1160) {
                               if (ItemHandler.addItem(item2.randomKQ() == 15334)) {
				PlayerHandler.messageToAll = &quot;BGS was just dropped by the KQ&quot;;
			    }[/code]

Any ideas?</description>
