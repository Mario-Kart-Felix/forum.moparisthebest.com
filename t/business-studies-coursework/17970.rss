    <description>Hai.

Here art my question : 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Question: How does a small independent retailer survive in the same market as the large supermarkets? What could have been done to improve the likelihood of survival?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Easy, simple. The following reasons i have so far : 
- They are generally closer to people&#39;s houses.
- Shop loyalty, like if you keep going there they may give you lil bonuses
- Quicker to go to if you want small, because usually the queues in supermarkets are massive.

So, does anyone have any other ideas? The above are just...uh...boring..dull...original.

Thanks :)</description>

              <p>Large supermarkets tend to employ huge numbers of people and as a result most of them don’t know much about the products they sell. A smaller shop will probably pride itself on its expert knowledge and so will be able to give you a lot more help and advice. Linking to this - if you take a broken item to a large chain store, they will try and sell you a whole new unit but in a small shop they would probably try and sell you something that will fix it at a fraction of the cost.</p>
