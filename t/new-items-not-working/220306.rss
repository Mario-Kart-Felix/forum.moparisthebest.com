              <p>erm, im not really sure its Miss Silab’s client that it isn’t working on, but rather the codes in your client.java and the source information itself. I’m not exactly sure whats going on there, lol, because ive never seen anything like that. But it looks like you need a new pickup code or something… if I’m totally wrong, super sorry, its never happened to me before. try taking a pickup code from another source available? otherwise snatch one off the forums if someone has one available.</p>
