    <title>Installing Hackint0sh on Gigabyte EX58 UD3R/UD5</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/installing-hackint0sh-on-gigabyte-ex58-ud3r-ud5/305544</link>
    <description>This will work for both boards, it will also likely work with other boards but I have not tested it
Firstly things you need:
A copy of iAtkos v7 [URL=http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4965049/iATKOS_v7_10.5.7_DVD_for_Intel_AMD_PC]Link TPB[/URL] Note: there are other trackers you can get this from, i recommend IPT where it is a freeleech torrent 
Drivers for your Card (I will demonstrate using a GTX 2xx series card so i will post links for those)
A hard drive partition or a second HDD
Enabler: http://netkas.org/?p=104
Drivers: http://www.nvidia.com/object/GeForce_MacOSX_18.5.2f16.html
Note: Install the enbaler first then the drivers but i&#39;ll revise this when we come to that step
Firstly burn your copy of iAtkos onto a DVD, alot of users recommend doing this at slow speeds to avoid errors, mine did it at 16x times and had no issues
Secondly enter your BIOS and under the integrated peripherals you will see the RAID SATA/AHCI and it should be set to automatic, change it to AHCI
Now boot into your CD and press F8 and type
[code]cpus=1 busratio=20[/code] 
Now you should see the mac taskbar across the top, go Utilities &gt; Disk utility and choose the install location. For this step i had a spare 80gb HDD so thats what i&#39;ve used, however if you&#39;ve sued a partition it will appear here. Now click erase and format as 
[code]Mac OS Extended (journaled)[/code]
Now close disk utility and you should see te apple logo flashing between red and silver click continue in the bottom right, keeping going through the stages until you see an option that has &#39;Customize...&#39; on it. Now go into there and we need to add the drivers appropriate for us indivually but we all need defualt ones so make sure you tick the following: iAtkos v7 main System, Chameleon V2,Extra Directory, DSDT, DSMOS, AIPC driver, Disabler OHR, Remove TyMCE, AHCI, Intel Sata/IDE, JMicron Sata/Ide, Post Install Actions.
I also included the PS/2 drivers and the nvidia ones but they are optional as is everything else, if you see something in there that you think you need then check it.
Now just go through the forms filling out all your information and then it will install, restart and you will be facing a Mac desktop, congratulations.
You will notice that your resolution will be stuck at 1024x768 and this is really poor, especially if we have GTX 2xx series card so now download the enabler and the drivers from above and install them on your mac. I&#39;ll add a screenshot of my Graphics card in system profiler later, im in windows 7 at the moment. Note: you will need to reboot at this stage. Ok now you have graphics done but chances are you dont have internet or sound. Sound i&#39;m still working on solving but the internet is fairly indivdual. I have a tenda W541U

which you cant seem to buy anymore, but i&#39;d imagine the newer tendas work just the same. If like me you already had an OS and your tenda just left plugged in, unplug it and plug it back in. OS X should say a new USB device has been plugged in and a wireless program will open up showing you an empty table with a button saying &#39;Resca&#39; below it. Click that and your wireless networks should appear and you can just connect from there. Then just configure your network preferences to your liking (i won&#39;t explain this because i suck at networking) and you can now connect to the internet, it should say there are software updates available, i have installed these with no issues so you should be fine to do the same.
And there we go you have a hackintosh machine :) I had some help writing this guide from a guy he gave me key information about the boot flag and the graphics drivers so thanks to him. And thats it. If all went well you should be able to get system information that looks something like this
