              <p>I honestly had no idea how widespread this story was, but yes please be sensitive because I would really love to strangle you or uppercut you right in the jaw right now if I met you face to face. Not that we’re looking for sympathy but I’ve never in my life seen a case such as this. I’m just curious if people have heard about the case, or have heard cases similar to this that may have been a large ordeal in your community but not talked on a national scale? Are you even from the US? I swore you were from Europe.</p>

<p>Anyway, it is very sad. Very, very sad. I’m very surprised it happened in such a great area too. I guess you aren’t safe anywhere these days.</p>
