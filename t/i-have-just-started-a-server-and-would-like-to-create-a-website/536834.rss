<p>It’s for a free <a href="http://www.yournamehere.co.nf" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.yournamehere.co.nf</a> (comes with file manager, mysql, unlimited .co.nf’s i think)</p>
<p>Enjoy, it’s better than a free .tk</p>

<p>Read through that.</p>
<p>Besides a domain you need a webhost, there’s quite a few out there on offer. X10premium have always been good to me, give them a try.</p>
