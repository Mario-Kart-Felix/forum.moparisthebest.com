    <description>We&#39;ve all had them and will have many more
But recently I&#39;ve had some odd dreams probably due to me sleeping whenever I get the chance lol

So the cops were raiding us/me and they were different colors but too many green cops  then they were all crayons and I had too many green crayons for the box   God I hate dreams</description>

              <p>-Nothing, I had that same dream a long time ago (it was sometime last year)… Iirc I was being crawled on by some spiders and I couldn’t move at all, then I felt something like an electric shock go through my body.</p>
<p>Edit: I just remembered another one, I met a woman in my home and I bent over to lick her vagina and suddenly I looked up and it was a man. The man told me he was my dad and that this was a test to see if I was gay. Then he walked away with his vagina dripping honey. I am not making this up.</p>

              <p>I remember this one dream when I was Stu (stew?), the father from the Rugrats. He had to pee really bad. Then all of a sudden he started peeing and he felt a lot better. I woke up and my bed was soaked in piss. Happened like 4 years ago. I just remembered it now for some reason</p>

I think I need to stop researching this, it’s driving me crazy… especially when I’m the type of person who believes in supernatural things.

<p>I have/had it for the past 10 years. I didn’t get into it because I figured its not really what I was talking about. And yeah, once you get used to it its not so bad.  While were on that subject I also believe this is why people think they’ve been abducted by aliens lol. They be dumb</p>

<p>And now its unlocked. I was hoping low spam as I find dreams to be one of the most interesting parts of the mind.</p>
<p>I have a recurring dream where I’m in my house and people with guns are tying to get me so I have to try and escape. I never get shot lol but I always have this dream.    And does anyone ever drive or ride something then it just turns into something else hahaha. I’m in a corvette or something then its a four wheeler.  Wtf?</p>
