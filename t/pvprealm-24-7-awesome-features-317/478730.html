What is PvPRealm is actually about?</p>
<p>It’s about a guy named Tim, He was outside playing with his friends when he knew he was born to be something. He went inside and switched on his laptop and searched “How to be cool like chuck norris” on Google. The first result was RSPS!<br>
From then on, he went to JAVA programming  Classes from Kindergarden all the way up to University and received a degree in “Nerd Java Programming”. He later moved on creating games for himself such as solitare and pinball. After he grew bored, He moved on to Runescape. He found out that Evolution of combat was gay and how people was quitting and he felt that he should be doing better then this to serve the community of the internet better. So he downloaded a source from Rune-Server and changed the server names and usernames. When he released it to public and let players play it, he realise he had little players. So he went on and code it and made it as enjoyable as possible. It was named Platinum-X back then and it has grew bigger and better. It had a overwhelming response when PvPRealm was first released to the public and we would like to thank you to the players who showed their support. We have been growing daily and receiving support from players. The Main Owner also thought that why he didn’t do this in the first place when RSW was in its early years growing rapidly with 4 pools in the chatbox. Now, PvPRealm has been decently known around the RSW Community and soon to the RSPS Community out there. I’m glad to say PvPRealm has overcome many challenges and problems together as a one big family.</p>
