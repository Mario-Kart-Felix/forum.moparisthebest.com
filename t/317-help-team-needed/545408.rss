    <description>Hi my name is josh and I am currently working hard to learn java to make a 317 RSPS. In the last week I have learned alot  but not nearly enough to really implement much. I have many great ideas but not the java knowledge to complete it....

Basically I need someone who understands and can somewhat write java and could help me out.

I already have a good 2006 317 source. I am using Revival-RS source with 2006Memory&#39;s client. I have got the server running and have made a good amount of changes.

I already have a server and website and have even jar and signed my webclient! The server is live! I just need more help!
