    <description>After a while of my server running, it&#39;ll get this and then disconnect everyone: 

[code]java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: recv failed
        at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)
        at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(Unknown Source)
        at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(Unknown Source)
        at client.packetProcess(client.java:17820)
        at client.packetSending(client.java:17795)
        at PlayerHandler.process(PlayerHandler.java:154)
        at server.main(server.java:58)
pimpscape Server [fatal] - exception[/code]

What&#39;s wrong with that? Is it my connection or something because it says connection abort. If you need my packetProcess and my packetSending methods, ask for them and I&#39;ll post them.

ALSO: Would buying more RAM for my computer keep my server from crashing as much? Sometimes, I think my server throws an exception in the main thread, causing it to crash. What&#39;s my deal there?</description>
