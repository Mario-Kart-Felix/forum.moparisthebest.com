    <title>Runescape: Hacked?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-hacked/170714</link>
    <description>A few minutes ago, all Runescape servers dropped to 0 players after an intense lag in-game. The lag dropped from the normal 800~ fps to less than 1, which then crashed every server. They are back and returning to normal stability, but what caused this? Somebody spill coffee on a server disk or did somebody purposely crash them?</description>

Fellix, you’re making no sense, and you’re making yourself look stupid again. Just… stop.</p>
<p>The ‘master server’ idea, was some-what true. Every account is run by one server, where as there’s 159 game servers. When you log out to switch to a different world, your character is moved back to the main server, which then is moved to the new server. That’s why is takes 30~ seconds to change worlds. But to be able to hack that and crash it, that would take many years of experience. Who would really waste their time doing it?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Seriously, do you really think there is one server where 452985719899 characters are stored? You can never rely on one server. Prove: some people couldnt login for a while, where others could. That server was down where 1% of the people were, the other 99% were stored on 99 other servers. (Just for example, no one knows the real amounts)[/quote]<br>
He doesnt mean another runescape server. Maybe a mysql server?..</p>
<p>Anyways, theres no reason i can think of that would explain why they need this. If you can login to the same world immediately, you can login to another in the same time. Its just a part of the game so you can’t switch worlds and lets say mine rune ore continuously.</p>

<p>It used to be that you could switch worlds immediately, so the 30s thing is only something they programmed to prevent people from world hopping to quick. As for the ‘moving’ character, I would think they just read stats from their database cluster and write them back when you log out, so you’re screwed if you just did a 10 hour straight <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>That’s true. Don’t you see stat updates until you logged out?</p>

<p>The ‘master server’ idea, was some-what true. Every account is run by one server, where as there’s 159 game servers. When you log out to switch to a different world, your character is moved back to the main server, which then is moved to the new server. That’s why is takes 30~ seconds to change worlds.

<p>It used to be that you could switch worlds immediately, so the 30s thing is only something they programmed to prevent people from world hopping to quick.

<p>Seriously, do you really think there is one server where 452985719899 characters are stored? You can never rely on one server. Prove: some people couldnt login for a while, where others could. That server was down where 1% of the people were, the other 99% were stored on 99 other servers. (Just for example, no one knows the real amounts)</p>
