    <title>Testscape help please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/testscape-help-please/81213</link>
    <description>Hello i am recently coding a source called Paradise Scape. And im using the testscape source. now i fixed the beard glitch and some other things. but im mainly stuck on fixing that stat glitch. (read below for info on what the stat glitch is). and the char command glitch (also read below)

STAT GLITCH: When ever somebody levels up in a certain skill it wont update. like lets say they have 50 str. then they get 51 str. it will say 50/51 str until they log off then back on. how can i fix this.

CHAR COMMAND GLITCH:ok now i have added the char command but i&#39;m still having a problem. when you change your appearance using ::char it will reset every time you log out or dc. how do i make it save their appearance?</description>
