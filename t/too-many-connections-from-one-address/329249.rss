    <description>I had trouble connecting to localhost so I switched to no-ip. It says Login limit exceeded. Too many connections from your address. Please tell me where I can find X-Logging code fix so I can delete for my server.</description>

              <p>Damnit. I messed something up and now it says no response from server. Is there any pro coders/server owners that understand everything and haven’t just followed a guide? And own teamviewer. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> I would accept your help happily. I have vista, and everyone I’ve talked to doesn’t know what to do. Am I just fucked?</p>

<p>Sounds like your running 2 of the same ports.<br>
Switch your server port to something like 5555…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to your server source directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Server.ini</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove “43594” and replace with “5555” (Without quotes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart your server, if it still does it, compile and run.</p>
</li>
</ol>
