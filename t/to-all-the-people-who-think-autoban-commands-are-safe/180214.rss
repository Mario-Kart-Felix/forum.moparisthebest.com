    <description>For example,you make setitem auto ban you. 
But they can just go into the clients client.java, and search for setitem.
They can change it to something else like &#39;starter&#39;. And when they type it, you won&#39;t suspect anything
Same with other commands such as noclip
I&#39;m just posting this because I seen too many servers command auto ban when they are useless if you have your own client..</description>
