    <description>Ive followed all these guides to creating a private server i had it running at one point but then i tryed to changed sources and everything messed up again, Ive done all my portfowarding correctly but it still wont let others in.  Ive used port checker and it says my ports are open. What all files am i suppose to edit to make it run with my ip? 
I have changed the clients gui and client to my ip but still doesn&#39;t work only lets me in on 127.0.0.1 help.
