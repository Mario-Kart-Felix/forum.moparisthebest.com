    <title>My Skiller, Pics and Goals</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-skiller-pics-and-goals/130265</link>
    <description>Hey,

     My main lost membership and I was browsing through Fagex runescape guides, and saw the sticky to make a level 3 skiller. I figured, what the fuck, why not. Since I couldn&#39;t use my main until I got back membership, I started a new account. My first goal is 99 Fishing/Cooking. After that I&#39;ll sell all my cooked. I have enough feathers to get to at least 89 fishing, then I&#39;ll switch to lobsters in the fishing guild. Here&#39;s pics of my character now. I don&#39;t do anything illegal so don&#39;t bother reporting me. The 2.8M I made by merchanting feathers to get enough cash to get 100k feathers, and I decided to stay on it. I&#39;m flyfishing until I run out of feathers, which will be in about 3590 trips. I&#39;ve been training for a total of a week and a half. I am really into this, and I love getting reported 5 times an hour. =)

If I cooked all my raws I&#39;d have 65-66 cooking, so don&#39;t call me a noob.</description>
