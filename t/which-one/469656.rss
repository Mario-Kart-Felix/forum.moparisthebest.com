    <description>I have been looking into white hat hacking and such, just because i was bored with everything and wanted to try something new, and i read some things and it says the first think you really need to do is learn a programing language. Is this true? If so, what language is best to learn? What are the differences between then languages? Is one good for programs, and the other is good for game creating? I dont know haha.</description>

Thanks for the input! Also, i heard that tutorials can only get you so far, that you would need to go and take a class or something to accully fully understand it. Is that true? I would love some links though.(:<br>
[/quote]a class is a glorified tutorial; both tutorials and classes can only get you so far, practice will get you the rest of the way. keep practicing and you’ll get better noticeably[/quote]</p>
<p>This might help u figure out whats easier to learn…</p>

<p>python and Visual Basic i know were easy for me when i first started… but i stuck with VB n quit doing python after a month or so.</p>
<p>after I started with Visual Basic (VB) a year and a half later im still learning it but i understand other languages ALOT better now then when i started and im moving in the C,C#, and C++ area but i still go back to VB if i have trouble making something.</p>
<p>i have visual studio 2010 … yes legit … for those thinking pirated lol it comes with VB,C,C#,C++,JAVA, and a WHOLE lot more but you can download VB express FREE</p>
<p>2010 versions: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express</a></p>
<p>2012 versions: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-windows-desktop#product-express-desktop-details" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-windows-desktop#product-express-desktop-details</a></p>
<p>2012 version even for phones pick what u like:    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products</a></p>
<p>i even make my own coding now unlike when i started, i was using coding from tuts and other peoples work <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> not my own but as i learned more n made more n started fixing other peoples work and my early work and making changes big and small n making a big difference to the programs ive made i could tell how much more i know now from then.</p>
<p>i have like 50 E-books now lol</p>
<p>remember languages are also changing and you could b someone to add ur “mark” in a big code book with a small snippet that no one else figured was possible ever possible.</p>
<p>i made codes that do the same as others but are wrote different so keep that in mind. in VB some codes mixed with others will give you a random effect … i remember i added something to a radio button and mixed it with something else and it didnt work right… it was like 9 months ago or so but i have it still lol here it is …</p>
<p>ok i had one form open through another and here is the code … one of my first few attempts to code my own program lol<br>
i look at it now n think wtf was i thinking lol but ya there it is…</p>
<p>Private Sub RadioButton1_CheckedChanged(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles RadioButton1.CheckedChanged</p>
<pre><code>    RadioButton1.Checked = BackColor = Color.Aqua
    Me.Close()
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>Using Me.Close() to close the App Window to my Form2 works but when opened again the RadioButton1 is STILL checked.  I messed with it and found that adding another code to it will help it stay UN-Checked. I can Now open it as much as i want WITHOUT closing the MAIN form ( Default Named Form1 ) and it will Now be UN-Checked.</p>
<p>i also did this one just to see what would happen lol</p>
<p>Private Sub RadioButton1_CheckedChanged(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles RadioButton1.CheckedChanged</p>
<p>MessageBox.Show(“Message Here”)<br>
Me.Close()</p>
<p>if u want something SIMPLE as far as i know VB is the SIMPLEST language to learn so if ur into that then here are links</p>
<p>Visual Basic Book Store (bundle of E-Books) : <a href="http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6498045/Visual_Basic_Book_Store" rel="nofollow noopener">http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6498045/Visual_Basic_Book_Store</a><br>

<p>anyway over all in 10 years you want atleast 3 of any types of languages if not more mastered or learned enough to do what ever u want.<br>
for hacking …</p>
<p>if u just wanna shoot the breeze with hacking stuff get… net tools, cain n able, cow patty, Back Track, and so on… and mess around and maybe think about the features u see and what they do and try to think of a way to improve them and stop them.</p>
<p>here is a small hacking site i just google searched: <a href="http://hackingncrackingtools.blogspot.com/#uds-search-results" rel="nofollow noopener">http://hackingncrackingtools.blogspot.com/#uds-search-results</a></p>
<p>or check out this site i made with a friend on xbox live lol <a href="http://hacknvb.tk/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://hacknvb.tk/</a><br>
has things to do with hacking and programming in MANY languages…</p>

              <p>I would suggest starting off with an easier language, then moving on to the C family. C, C#, C++ whatever tickles your fancy. However, don’t think you’re going to spend a month or so learning a language and that’s you. It takes well over a year to properly master your first programming language. It’s all about building up a base.</p>
<p>Since whitehat hacking thickly revolves around website hacking I would suggest learning PHP. If you’re looking for some tutorials I could point you towards a couple.</p>

<p>a lot of whitehat hacking will involve punching holes in websites, so learning the html/css/php/sql combo will be essential, as well as learning the intricacies of things like code injections, RFI/LFIs, SQL injection etc… oh and how to use tools like potential SQL injection finders, packet sniffers, RATs, the metasploit framework and so on.</p>
<p>you may also find yourself occasionally punching holes into network-related things so learning about protocols and networking in general work is essential. finally, learn C, C++ and assembly to understand things like buffer overflows and more down-at-the-hardware hacking to add to your repertoire.</p>
