<p>Not really what i said…<br>
I meant that you should be ( a little bit ) more humane towards an actual crippled person ( performing a theft of any kind ) then towards a person pretending to be crippled.<br>
Either way ( crippled or pretending ) , the police didn’t have the right to violate him like that.</p>
