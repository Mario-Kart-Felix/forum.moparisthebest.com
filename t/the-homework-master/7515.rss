              <p>My school is pairing up all the year 12â€™s with the year 9â€™s because there gay, well anyway I get in trouble if the kid doesnâ€™t put all his assignments in on time, so basicly, my school is saying do this kids assignments for a term. Well this is my last year of school any way so it doesnâ€™t matter. Well anyway, I have done like 4 of his assignments already but I cannot do this one because I am busy this whole week with, my graphics and modern history stuff, anyone who can help me with the homework load, so I can go out this weekend with my girlfriend I really need this right now, and I have spent like zero time with her, I might be able to figure out a good payment such as a runescape pking account or somthing, I am only doing this for the kid, I do all my own assignments. it looks pretty easy, and i will be very very great full to anyone who does.<br>
I need this assignment by the 14th/8 please</p>
<p>This is the out line.</p>
<p>Over the years people of the world have marvelled at the progress we have seen from robots. As much as we have marvelled, we have also been surprised that the progress has not been at a rate we have predicted. The Jet-sonâ€™s cartoon show was based in the 2000â€™s. Many science commentators of the 1950â€™s and 60â€™s predicted the human race would be living in space stations and populating other planets by 2001.</p>
<p>As interesting as the history of robotics is; the future is rich and exotic, it seems that robots could be come as much a part of everyday life as a refrigerator which was only mass produced in 1918 by Kelvinator.</p>
<p>This is an academic assignment. As such you will be required to use the referencing as bibliography system that is highlighted in your diary. You will refrain from using â€œIâ€, and â€œmeâ€ and other such terms.</p>
<p>The assignment requires you to write an essay on the future directions of robotics. You are not to just pull ideas out of thin air; you are required to justify your statements of the future direction of robotics by referencing articles and books you have read on the future and history of robotics. You much also ensure your assignment includes such things as, Asimovâ€™s laws for robots(as in I Robot), the Turning test, and other such facts you come across. The assignment will be typed on A4 paper. Your assignment must be at least 750 words.</p>
