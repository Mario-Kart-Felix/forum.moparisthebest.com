    <title>HELP rep++ if i can</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-rep-if-i-can/372376</link>
    <description>Well i wanted to start coding my server offline, why offline? Cause my router seems to not have a web page. (apple one). I type my default gateway IP and it says this page does not exist, etc..
But, im going to code offline (no portforwarding), i get in my client and it says or:
Error conecting (fail english sorry) to server,
or,
Pk planet (my client names, not my server, dont know how to change that) is offline, try again later.
Is there a way me to get in my client just to code without portforwarding? if yes, in gui file, i change to what, my router default gateway ip, to my no-ip ip (exaMPL.no-ip.biz) or to my house Ip?
