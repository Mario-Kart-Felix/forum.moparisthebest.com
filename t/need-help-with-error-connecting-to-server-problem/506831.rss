I portforwarded my router, I have no-ip running, downloaded all of the new java software, so i am kinda at a loss to what it could be.. unless it has to do with the cache, but it is in my C:/. Can someone please help me out, I have been working on getting all of this going for about 2 hours now and I would be greatly appreciative.</description>
