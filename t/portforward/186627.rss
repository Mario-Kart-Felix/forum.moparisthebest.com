    <description>Im portforwarding on a labtop. I&#39;ve done the guide for my router, got a static ip, and opened the ports, but every time i try to make it so others can join it gives the following error: 

An error occured while Internet Connection Sharing was being enabled. Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) cannot be enabled due to an IP address conflict on the network. ICS requires the host be configured to use 192.168.0.1 Please ensure that no other client on the network is configured to use 192.168.0.1 

Also, im trying to enable this off the Local Area Connection not my Wireless Network Connection 3</description>
