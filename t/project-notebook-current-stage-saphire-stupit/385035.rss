    <description>[b][size=36pt]Project Notebook[/size][/b]

This thread is now continuing this thread: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,480350.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,480350.0.html[/url]

The first thread was used to see who would be willing to participate and to generate ideas. This thread will be used for:

1.)[s]Voting which members will be kicked by a popular vote and closing down the amount of members to a more handled amount.[/s]
2.)[s]After those members have been chosen, everyone will be sent a message asking them to post/PM me their state they live in.[/s]
3.)[s]A list will be created to create the most efficient shipping method after everyone has had their state identified.[/s]
4.)Finally, the shipping will begin. More details are below.

Also please make sure to check out the F.A.Q. at the bottom of the post. It has been updated since the last thread.

[size=28pt]Information you need to know about sending the notebook:[/size]

***Make sure to read these rules AND the ones on the first page of the notebook***

1. [b]You are expected to write in the notebook and send it off as soon as you get it.[/b] The last thing we need is procrastination. When you receive the notebook in the mail, write in it and be ready to send it to the next person ASAP.

2. [b]Find out their address ahead of time[/b] - We do not want to be in a habit of receiving the notebook and THEN asking the person&#39;s address. Ask the person you are sending it to ahead of time to make things move faster.

3. [b]Make sure you are giving the correct information![/b] Double-check for any errors and try to get them fixed right away. We don&#39;t want people sending the notebook to an incorrect address without a return label, or the notebook may easily get lost.

4. [b]Respect the notebook.[/b] Avoid damaging it at all costs. We want the notebook to be in top shape when it comes back. Use common sense and don&#39;t have food or drinks around the notebook and treat it with care.

5. [b]Respect other people and what they write in the notebook.[/b] Do not make comments about other members in the notebook. Do not write on someone else&#39;s pages. Do not write anything illegal or highly inappropriate in the notebook, or there is a good chance your pages will be ripped out before I post the pictures.

6. [b]Be patient.[/b] The notebook can take anywhere from 3-6 days to arrive, and probably 8-10 for across-country. Alert your parents to watch out for it if you must, and be prepared to have it.

7.[b] Be creative.[/b] You have a full 3 pages of the notebook (one page front and back, the other page the front, etc.) to yourself. You can draw, write quotes, etc. It doesn&#39;t matter. If you want to let other people write on your page for a conversation or something, [b]write that you permit other people writing on your pages.[/b] Feel free to attach photos or anything other that is lightweight.

8. [b]Be careful.[/b] Like I said before, be careful with the notebook. Do not use markers soak through other pages that don&#39;t belong to you, don&#39;t write on pages that don&#39;t belong to you, and use common sense and care while handling the notebook. We want it to turn out as neat and clean as possible.

9. [b]Be aware.[/b] Always be ready for the notebook. Always be aware of changes in schedule. You NEED to be on this thread constantly for updates. I will post if I have updated anything on the main post. [b]If you have a problem that turns up, YOU NEED TO REPORT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!![/b]

10. [b]Have fun[/b] and let&#39;s complete this project with motivation and maturity.  :D

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b][size=24pt]F.A.Q.[/size][/b]

[b]Q: What do we have to do?[/b]
A: You will receive a notebook in the mail from the person before you on the final list (after the states have been identified and order has been issued). You are expected to write something in the notebook and send it to the next person on the list. You will need to give your address to the person before you on the list when the time comes.

[b]Q: How many pages do we have in the notebook &amp; what can we write in it?[/b]
A: You can use up to 2 pages in the notebook. If you use a permanent marker, do not forget that it soaks through. Use a surface that it won&#39;t matter on. What you write in the notebook is completely up to you. You may draw pictures, write notes, greet other members, attach photos, etc. Nothing illegal or inappropriate please. Anything found to be that will be removed from the notebook before it is sent next.

[b]Q: May I send objects with the notebook?[/b]
A: Yes, but you are responsible for the shipping costs. If the person you are sending it to does not want to pay the extra shipping money, be aware that they can keep the object. I would advise not sending them, but it is not anyone&#39;s responsibility if the object is stolen, broken, etc. except yours.

[b]Q: What happens to the notebook when it is sent back to Chassy13?[/b]
A: First the results of the notebook will be scanned on a printer or have photos taken of it. I will post these on this thread. After that, the notebook will either be sent to MITB as a gift (if he okay with it) or a giveaway will be taken place for it. Although I am the creator of the project, I do not want to claim the notebook for myself as the same thing caused an issue in the Project Notebook mitb tried.

[b]Q: Will it cost anything?[/b]
A: You will need to go to the post office and possibly get it weighed depending on the method of shipping they offer. Shipping costs are around $2-5 for across-state and around $8-10 for Australia/New Zealand. I am not sure about the U.K., but it should be close to the same price as Australia/New Zealand. We will need several people that are willing (and can probably get a few donations) to pay the fee to ship to Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K.

[b]Q: What if I don&#39;t want to release my address?[/b]
A: The address can be sent privately to the previous person sending it to you. Any untrusted people will be hopefully kicked from the project, but your address will NOT be released. If you are that concerned, use an address that is not personal, such as a friend&#39;s house or public place that you can pick up the package from.

[b]Q: How long until this project starts?[/b]
A: The project will begin when the final members have been chosen, their states identified, and the order of mailing issued. I will begin by sending the notebook.

[b]Q: What if someone doesn&#39;t play their role?[/b]
A: Nothing we can do about that. This whole thing will be based upon trust. You will be expected to tell people important information along with playing your role and contributing.</description>

We can do research on how much it costs to transfer from Paypal directly to a bank. Then again, paypal is usually slow on transfers, so just doing a wire transfer bank to bank may be more efficient.<br>

It’s a minimum of 10$ and takes anywhere from 7-10 days to transfer in.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ah, well we’ll have to transfer the money to the next person as the previous person receives it, then. Wish we could find a cheaper way, though. D: Maybe we can just pay for the shipping all through one person, for each person shipping.</p>

<p>No reason we can figure out how to get this entire thing done over the summer. We can figure out everyone involved, calculate shipping costs, and pool together money to pay for shipping. Everyone splits the cost…no one gets left out dry. We can pay for faster shipping and limit people to a certain number of days. If we can manage that, no reason that people need to drop out come September.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t mind this, I wouldn’t mind throwing in 10-15$ to this.</p>
