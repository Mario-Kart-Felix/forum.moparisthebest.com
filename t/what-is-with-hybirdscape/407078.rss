    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-with-hybirdscape/407078</link>
    <description>I am confused, I am new I have tried all this extra server making stuff and I accually have a server up and I have JDK and all that but isnt HybridScape made just so you can get in the game and mess around? Please some one explain this to me. Also, if someone can point me in the right direction please do.
