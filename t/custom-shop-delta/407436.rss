    <description>Well I am pretty much out of ideas on this as I haven&#39;t tried it until now...but we will go on.

I am currently making a dungeoneering shop to my new minigame.

I am trying to make it run through tokens and not coins.

I have changed the Slot to Slot3(my tokens).

And when I try to buy items you have to have coins and tokens or you cannot buy it.

Does anyone have and Idea?

Some pictures below:
