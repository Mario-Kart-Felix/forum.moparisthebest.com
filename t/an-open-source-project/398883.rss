    <title>An open source project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-open-source-project/398883</link>
    <description>The Mopar RSC project is under development. Personally, I am not really interested in contributing to it / playing on it and the same goes with a few others here from what I have been told.

I really admired Peeter&#39;s DarkQuest project and the way he ran it.

I believe we can all agree that DDoS attacks, paid for by server owners to eliminate competition and boost subscriber profits, is the primary reason why the RSC private server community is dying.

What I propose are two paths:
1.) Take RSC and replace all game content, change the mechanics, and mold it into something completely different and leave the RSC community completely and those who DDoS the competition.

2.) Run an open source project with a private, invite-only server used for testing and development purposes only. Grant public access to all code and write clear documentation so that anyone interested may host their own instance of the server. I do not know if it would cut down on being DDoSed, but maybe bringing back Hamachi for a VPN connection would be a possibility.


I would like to hear everyone&#39;s input specifically on the idea of servers using Hamachi/VPN routing to see if it actually would block a botnet from packet flooding a server.


If path 2 is a viable option, then who here would be interested in a game concept of resuming RSC where Andrew Gower left off when he transitioned to RS2? Many things that went into RS2 were good ideas that are feasible in RSC, such as summoning and runecrafting. Done correctly in a professionally run project environment utilizing Subversion revisioning (SVN), a public bug tracker, a GNU open source set up, and a &quot;newbie&quot; friendly atmosphere with the goal of teaching a better understanding of Java and project management, much could be available for the benefit of many.</description>

              <p>I have tested Hamachi using a gateway network. The free version supports up to 16 members and the paid ($33/mo, $200/year) supports up to 256 registered computers.</p>
<p>Tor could not preform with enough speed/latency to connect to a server and play normally.</p>
<p>Last Stand had an invite-only approach and it prevented growth but it was not targeted for a ddos attack.</p>
