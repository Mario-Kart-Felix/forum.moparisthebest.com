It wasnt that much about speed you had the aspect of hiding on a bench between two people and hiding inbetween guys in white robes the only speed side was leap of faith and it did suck epicly the gameplay was shit every mission was one and the same you’d done one mission you’d done em all. I completed it within a weekend with only 4-5 hours of actual gameplay, it was absolutely awful. Its main aim was stealth and nothing more the speed side wasn’t exagerated enough they had the climbing fair enough but that wasn’t fast paced or thrilling</p>

<p>Say on a game like mirrors edge, you have loads of people chasing you, you need to see all angles at once and you cannot in first person.[/quote]<br>
Mirrors edge wouldn’t work 3rd person because the game is focused around speed and the thrill of the chase as it were and if it were 3rd person you are too fare away from the action kinda like a fly hovering behind</p>

              <p>Games like COD4 need 1st person, but hack ‘n’ slash and games which need you to utilise the environment (eg Assassin’s creed) require 3rd. So i therefore agree with Thug-life.</p>
