    <title>Client Jar Signing Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-jar-signing-problem/246441</link>
    <description>Hello as some of you may have read I posted a previous thread:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi everyone as some of you may know I am running on Mac OSX and I can&#39;t run .bat files on it (unless I install windows on it which I really don&#39;t want to do) and I thought it would be hopeless playing servers because NO client would run on my G5. But then I found an OS Universal (Operating System Universal) version of Moparscape for my Mac. And I picked up on that I can run .jar files on my Mac which is great news. And the OS Universal version of Mopar runs great on my mac. The one thing is. The new server I play (Jbirdscape) has different item ID&#39;s than Moparscape. So can someone either make Jbirdscape&#39;s client OS Universal or someone teach me how to? 
Thanks, really appreciate it 

-0wnz&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anyways I am trying to make a Jar file because of this reason and I got all the way to the part where you have to sign it. I got all the way through and I know that I did everything right because I referred to [url=http://forum.ragezone.com/f365/tut-making-a-webclient-448998/]http://forum.ragezone.com/f365/tut-making-a-webclient-448998/[/url] and for other people it worked. But when I try to sign the jar it says 

[code]Unable to sign JAR File.
Caused By:[/code]

And it doesn&#39;t even show me the problem. So can someone either tell me what the problem is or teach me how to make a client OS Universal? Thanks</description>
