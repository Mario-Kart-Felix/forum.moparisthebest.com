    <title>On Sovereignty</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/on-sovereignty/175439</link>
    <description>Mind, I&#39;m a resident of the United States and I&#39;m talking about the United States in this little... reminder.

I read the paper, I watch the news. All this protesting shit is going on. It makes me wonder, do these people not understand that they are powerless? I don&#39;t mean that the general people are not capable of overthrowing their government, because our current regime doesn&#39;t restrict us so. What I mean is, people campaign for change. They accuse our leaders of such great injustices and usurpations of power. I want to scream at the fucktards, to rip every bit of flesh from their worthless bones. The moment they called themselves citizens of the United States, they gave their everything to the government. Their lives are no longer theirs; they have no &quot;rights&quot; anymore.The power we have over our government can be seen like a celebratory cake, portraying us as the guests: the host, our government, lets us have slices of it, but he reserves the right to take that shit away because we guests are ingrates and he&#39;s the host. I could go on for pages about how worthless the citizen is, how undeserving of his power he is. However, my fingers fucking ache. Somehow, clearing them of excess skin with a pocket knife wasn&#39;t such a great idea in retrospect. Anyway, the citizen is nothing. Shut the fuck up about how you want or don&#39;t want some bill to be passed. You accepted the government&#39;s sovereignty, so just fucking deal with it because they aren&#39;t listening to you. I&#39;ve been around rubbing alcohol for the last few hours, so if this shit turns out to be completely incoherent and/or pointless, blame my lack of oxygen.</description>

<p>Shut the fuck up you fucking retarded faggot. Do you even know who the fuck he was, or why he killed himself? You have the fucking flaw in your thought pattern, and we all respected sL, and he was the last person we would ever even think about telling to kill himself. When he said he was going to kill himself we thought he was kidding, as he always made jokes about seppuku. If anything, I hope you get cracked under peer pressure to kill yourself.</p>
