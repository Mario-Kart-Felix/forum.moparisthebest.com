    <title>What happened to</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-happened-to/398027</link>
    <description>Showing when a user was warned, muted, or banned for a post? I felt like that really showed a level of authority by the staff, along with the general embarrassment for the user. That information shouldn&#39;t be kept private and underground, it should be used as a head on a stake to warn other users of where not to go.</description>

<p>If the mod was compatible with SMF2 at the time, it prolly would have stayed. As the mod was not updated at the time MPSC/MITB forums did, so it never came back. As well as the fact, SMF2 has its own moderation system, it was never really needed anyways.[/quote]<br>
That would be correct, and your talking about the visual modification was never really needed? Because I will have to agree on that, if not the warnings being showed when a staff member is warning X member, the warning, moderation, or banned group could be seen under the username still.</p>

Been muted before, only knew who because of the post I made that was infractable. I don’t think anything within SMF currently informs the user of a mute or anything. I think this work falls onto the mods.</p>

              <p>Showing when a user was warned, muted, or banned for a post? I felt like that really showed a level of authority by the staff, along with the general embarrassment for the user. That information shouldn’t be kept private and underground, it should be used as a head on a stake to warn other users of where not to go.</p>
