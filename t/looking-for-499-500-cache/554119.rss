    <title>Looking for #499/500 cache</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-499-500-cache/554119</link>
    <description>I am in search of a #499/500 cache. I know a few have been released as I have found posts on them, but all of the links are dead. The dates of these caches will be between May 21st, 2008 - July 1st, 2008 (I believe). Let me know if you have one, I have quite the big cache collection and may have something of interest to offer back as well. I am not interested in a #498 cache and do not care of the #499/500 is incomplete, I am only interested in the cs2 archive. Thanks! :p</description>
