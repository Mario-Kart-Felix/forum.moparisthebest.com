The drawing compared to the actual thing looks like shit. Like it was made in Metasequoia. I thought Jagex would have some better model making software considering they’re a popular game making a shitload of cash per year.<br>

They need to update their software I admit, It would be cool if they could keep one client like this for players using a browser and have another client like wow does so they can display higher resolution things and more faces on each thing.[/quote]</p>
<p>I wouldn’t mind downloading a desktop client for better graphics. I already have the downloadable version anyway…</p>
