    <title>Need help with adding stuff to 508 server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-adding-stuff-to-508-server/294335</link>
    <description>Ok so heres the thing. Im not really good with coding etc, I can make simple commands but nothing hard. Can anyone out there help me with getting this stuff to my 508 server: 

Skulls in wildy - Like lvl 1, lvl 2 etc
Ppl will loose their stuff when they die
Pvp drops if its possible
Traiding
Adding d claws and other stuff
Maybe a little command board for admins with ban, ipban etc
Making barrows stuff work. Like Dharoks hit higher when low hp

Ppls who helps me with this stuff can be rewarded with admin/mod if they want. THe server will be on 24/7 when its done :)

Ty for help</description>
