    <title>[Look] Sloppy Famas [Look]</title>

    <description>This model didn&#39;t take me this long, It&#39;s sloppy and i f***** it up at the end. I can do better but this was my first attempt at a gun. I know seems &quot;square&quot; and the barrel is messed up. This model contains : 2 primatives. Not that hard to spot them ;). I&#39;m going to try full primative modeling soon. Also, i couldn&#39;t find/make any good textures. Anyways here it is.
