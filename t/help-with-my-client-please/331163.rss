    <description>This sounds kinda leechy, but before i want to do any work on my client i want to change the name of it, i&#39;ve changed everything i can find in client.java, but i believe the rest of it is in gui.java, which i cant find?? Also i&#39;ve looked at another client, and it has custom stuff in it, how can i add my own custom interfaces? Thanks guys if you help

              <p>pretty sure you go into your client and then “gui.java” if you found it.<br>
then search either server ip, no-ip or just ip.<br>
then change whatever is there to 127.1.1 or localhost</p>
<p>should work</p>
