    <title>Eternal Isle Client - Previously World Of Thuuglife Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eternal-isle-client-previously-world-of-thuuglife-client/275238</link>
    <description>        Hello. My name is Zak, and I have been into Runescape since I was about 8 years old. Now, at 14, I still have a passion for Runescape and RS Private Servers. Due to problems in my home, I was forced to abandon all hope of ever getting into private servers again. Today, two years later, I just found a copy of my old client that took me a month to make lying in my basement. Finally, my server is up again. Unfortunately, once my server closed down, someone took the liberty of stealing my no-ip address for themselves. Of course, they are not even hosting a server with it. The reason I shared this brief paragraph with you is because before, I was Ztornado5 and Thuuglife. Now, I am proud to say that I am Mastazak, the RSPS, PSP, loving fanatic with computer addiction problems (jk) and brain that craves electronics. To celebrate the start of my new life, I am releasing my client, formerly called &quot;World Of Thuuglife&quot; (which you may look up if you desire). The new name for it is Eternal Isle. I plan to release this &quot;new&quot; client in about a week. I would like to release a &quot;beta&quot; of sorts to everyone and would like their input. In addition to that, I will post pictures of everything for you. Now, the last time that I posted this exact same client, everyone went on and on about how I did this and leeched that. Well, that&#39;s all not true. I will never again post a single word on any website without proof that it is my work. I can assure you that I will NOT make the same mistake again. Here&#39;s where you come in. All that I am asking, is that you take a few minutes to review my work, and give your honest input. Now when I say honest, I mean [b]Constructive[/b] Criticism. Where do you think Delta started? Tonypker13? Anyone? They all started at the same place. Nowhere. Do you think everyone starts at a high level of coding where they know everything about Java/coding? No. They don&#39;t. I remember when I first started playing runescape, and I kept asking my friend how to talk to other people  :D. I&#39;m not just asking you to review my client, or just asking you to apply these things to my post only. I&#39;m asking you to keep these things in mind all the time. If you want to respond with something stupid, like &quot;go get life&quot;, or &quot;go watch more movies&quot;, that&#39;s just fine. I could really care less. But for the people who really want to help, here it is.

              <p>Thanks, I already have a source, but it does not amount to sources that others have made. This client is pretty much compatible with almost anything out there, which means that most people will be able to use it. If it was compatible only with my source, it would reduce the compatibility with other’s sources. Anyway, thanks for the suggestion though.</p>

<p>  I understand what you mean about the flame that new coders get. But, in order to be succesful, you have to create something no one has ever seen/done before. You have to make the server enthusiastic, something that will attract players to play. You should look at Delta’s first account on moparscape.
