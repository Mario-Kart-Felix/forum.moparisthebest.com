    <title>Advice on class enrollment</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/advice-on-class-enrollment/387921</link>
    <description>I am enrolled in a class for my senior year of high school in which I get to go to a trade/career school for part of my normal school day. I am taking computer science, but the school offers three options of what language to focus on. They have classes for Java, C#, and C++. I already have some knowledge of Java, but not the other two. I would like to know which language is most useful in today&#39;s software industry and why. Thanks in advance :)</description>

              <p>Semaphore has made a few good posts on this matter:</p>
<p>[quote=“semaphore, post:16, topic:290101”]Learn ansi c.</p>
<p>Understand c++.</p>
<p>Profit from java.[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote=“semaphore, post:24, topic:309992”]You’re right. Learning c just to screw around with JVMTI will leave you confused and frustrated.</p>
<p>You should learn c to better understand the ultimate foundation of java. There’s an old quote that resurfaces every now and again at the client sites I work with. It seems that there’s a generation of <span class="bbcode-i">coders</span> whose first language is java. This is somewhat troubling because of just how much one misses by only learning java.</p>
<p>Anyway here is the quote:</p>
<p>If you know c, java is simple.<br>
If you only know java, good luck with c.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are exceptions to the rule but I’ve worked with hundreds of developers. I’ve never found an exception. The only people that have ever disagreed with me on this are those that learned java first. I’ve even had people that learned java first say ‘Oh I had no problem learning c!’, but when given a task… say… create a small app that reads from shared memory and forks a new process on write to the memory and notifies the parent process by writing to a predefined shared block of memory… deer in headlights. In fact most of them don’t even know how to fork a new process.</p>
<p>If you learned C first, you would agree with me that java is morbidly simple in comparison. (TBH I look at java in much the same way most java developers look at javascript).[/quote]</p>

              <p>Yeah, I have heard a little bit about C++ and it’s memory management and pointers, its quite a foreign concept for me considering I started off learning with Java and Pascal. C++ also seems to be the focus of most of the classes at the college I plan on attending, so I should probably start learning it soon.</p>

<p>I suggest you learn C++ first, get hold of pointers (which can be great if you learned it first here, than when you come over to C++ from java, you will be some what confused)<br>
and you will learn alot things that java hides from you such as static and dynamics bindings stc,</p>

</aside>
<p>I see these advertised all the time, but at the same time all the companies hiring .NET developers here (UK) seem to know absolutely nothing about what they’re asking for. They go with .NET because there’s all sorts of Microsoft associated qualifications you can get, and I think they see Microsoft and think “Oh yes, this MUST be the crème de la crème of the programming world since Microsoft makes WINDOWS”.</p>
<p>I’ve had call backs off such job advertisers with barrages of acronyms for various qualifications that I don’t have, that if I wanted I would have to spend aprox £500 for a 2 day course in order to get it, learning a grand total of nothing. I think I’ve now gone horribly off-topic and reminded myself why I was trying to produce a nice portfolio.</p>

</aside>
<p>I have planned on being a software developer for quite some time now, I’m absolutely sure that it is what I want to do after college. I would agree with you if I was an average student, but I am intelligent, a quick and capable learner, and I want to challenge myself. So there is no other answer in the question of what profession I want to do.</p>
<p>That being said, what is your opinion on the original question Newty?</p>

              <p>I am enrolled in a class for my senior year of high school in which I get to go to a trade/career school for part of my normal school day. I am taking computer science, but the school offers three options of what language to focus on. They have classes for Java, C#, and C++. I already have some knowledge of Java, but not the other two. I would like to know which language is most useful in today’s software industry and why.
