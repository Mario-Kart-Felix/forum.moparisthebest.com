    <title>My first few codes i made in python</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-few-codes-i-made-in-python/444876</link>
    <description>I started learning python a few days ago and i wanted to post some of my code its funny but the tutor I&#39;m learning from told me to be creative so here is one python program i made. i would love to know everyone&#39;s thoughts or ideas how to improve it. 

my code
[code]pornstar = 3
people = 12
sad = 7
happy = 5

people = sad - happy
pornstar = happy
people = happy + sad
average = happy / sad

print &quot;there are&quot;, people, &quot;happy and sad&quot;
print &quot;there are&quot;, pornstar, &quot;able to sexytime&quot;
print &quot;there are&quot;, happy, &quot;but there are too many sad&quot;
print &quot;there are&quot;, sad, &quot;sadface&quot;[/code]</description>

In this tic-tac-toe game, the board is laid out in such a way that you choose which location you want to place your move. This is how the board is defined to be:<br>
012<br>
345<br>
678<br>
So, if you want to place your letter in the top-right corner, you want to type in the number “2” for your selection.</p>
<p>Have fun, and good luck!<br>

Yeah god forbid people learn any fucking way besides the way I did because mine is the best.  Everyone has different ways of thinking, i.e we don’t all learn in the same way.</p>

<p>python files don’t have to contain classes, they’re called modules. java most likely has poisoned you into thinking everything must be an object (ignoring primitives) and be contained in a class structure (class, interface, enumeration). what you’ve made isn’t a class.</p>

<p>my code</p>
<p>[code]pornstar = 3<br>
people = 12<br>
sad = 7<br>
happy = 5</p>
<p>people = sad - happy<br>
pornstar = happy<br>
people = happy + sad<br>
average = happy / sad</p>
<p>print “there are”, people, “happy and sad”<br>
print “there are”, pornstar, “able to sexytime”<br>
print “there are”, happy, “but there are too many sad”<br>
print “there are”, sad, “sadface”[/code]</p>
