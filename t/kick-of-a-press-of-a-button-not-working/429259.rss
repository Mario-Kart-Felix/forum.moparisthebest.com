    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kick-of-a-press-of-a-button-not-working/429259</link>
    <description>i have a tab for staff members to kick people with a touch of a button, sadly its kicking the person who presses &quot;kick&quot; anyway to kick the person that is click on?

[code]
Kicktab();
					noob = (client)server.playerHandler.players[i];
					noob.disconnected = true;
					noob.logoutButton = true;
}
[/code]</description>
