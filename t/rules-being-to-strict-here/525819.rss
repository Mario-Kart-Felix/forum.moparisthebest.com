    <title>Rules being to strict here</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rules-being-to-strict-here/525819</link>
    <description>I beleive the rules here are way to strict.  For instance this is  RSPS Community yet when creating a forums you need a webhost.  So why let people provide to others their hosting needs is it because you guy&#39;s are a bit to greedy with money and don&#39;t wanna see people make more then your forums ? I know this is going to get nothing but bad replies but whatever.  As I see it I have seen over 200 members leave in the past month so it don&#39;t really bug me any just hurting yourself :D r-s FTW</description>

<p>Trisidia was being an idiot and posted a thread about him selling VPS slots or something close. When everyone said “uhhh, read the rules and delete your post” Dawson got all butt hurt because Tris is his friend apparently, and decided to take it upon himself to make a scene about it and post this.</p>

This is how it goes:</p>
<p>One mod feels like the forum is getting a little…rowdy, and goes on an infraction spree then realizes that the nature of the forum is to joke/troll have fun then sits back down.</p>
<p>Rinse, and repeat.<br>

<p>Mopar is a little less stricter then Rune-Server e.g. you won’t get instant ban for lolz. Judging by your profile over there, it seems like they don’t want you there too! This is a friendlier community and we don’t tolerate retarded 12 year old’s thinking their bad because their username is gaysonsmokes and I haven’t really seen a member who well… actually like you.</p>

<p>I beleive the rules here are way to strict.  For instance this is  RSPS Community yet when creating a forums you need a webhost.  So why let people provide to others their hosting needs is it because you guy’s are a bit to greedy with money and don’t wanna see people make more then your forums ? I know this is going to get nothing but bad replies but whatever.  As I see it I have seen over 200 members leave in the past month so it don’t really bug me any just hurting yourself <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> r-s FTW</p>

</aside>
<p>The reason we don’t allow monetary transactions here is because of the chances of members being scammed. How is prohibiting these transactions a sign of us being “greedy”? Your logic is quite flawed. If you would like me to ban you so that you can enjoy R-S, I would be happy to do that, since MSCP isn’t FTW.</p>
<p>Also, where are you getting your statistics? You don’t have access to that information. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
