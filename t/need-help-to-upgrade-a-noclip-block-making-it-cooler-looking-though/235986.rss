    <title>Need help to upgrade a &quot;::noclip&quot; block. (Making it cooler looking though)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-to-upgrade-a-noclip-block-making-it-cooler-looking-though/235986</link>
    <description>I am wanting to make the player that uses noclip able to see the animation BEFORE he/she teleports to a jail like area.

[code]
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;noclip&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;= 1)//Makes sure its for player blocking only//
   {  
      //A code to &quot;wait&quot; 
       stillgfx(542 , absY, absX); //Explosion = I want the player to see this before teleporting. 
      //Code to &quot;wait&quot; 
       stillgfx(542 , absY, absX); //Turns into stone then dies.
       //Code to &quot;wait&quot; 
       sendMessage(&quot;You have angered a higher power, now you will pay for what you done.&quot;);
       teleportToX = &lt;X to where the jails are in the docks&gt;;
       teleportToY = &lt;Y to where the jails are in the docks&gt;;
       teleblock = true;
   }
[/code]

I don&#39;t know how to get a time delay or something. Any suggestions anyone?</description>
