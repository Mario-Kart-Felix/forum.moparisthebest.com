    <title>[508] Several questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-several-questions/349489</link>
    <description>Ok question # 1
My rune crossbow can hit a 168 on npcs very common, and barely hits at all on players. However when it does hit it can hit high. How can I make it hit more often on players, and not hit so high on npcs?

Question # 2.
Restore Special Potion

I want to make a potion that when you drink it, each dose will heal your special bar fully but can only be drank once every 2 minutes if you&#39;re a player, and can be drank as often as you want if your an admin.

Question # 3. 
Specials almost never hit.
How can I make it where specials for weapons hit more often and higher? They almost never hit and most the time barely hit at all.

Any answers?</description>
