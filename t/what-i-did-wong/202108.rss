          <blockquote>
              <p>The packets that the server is trying to send are basically going nowhere (this is a connection/timing/data problem), or just trying to send them before a send location is identified. What I think is happening is that the server is trying to do something with the client, and the client just can’t support it. Try getting a client that supports it, or stop fucking with things that clients don’t support. In other words, what you are trying to do is unknown to the client. This only gives such an error during runtime because Java doesn’t know if the certain connection’s client can handle it or not yet. Another thing that may be possible is just a bad connection with either the player or you.</p>
