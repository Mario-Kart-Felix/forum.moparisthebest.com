              <p>yea like he said you can do that or you could make a ::bank command available to every1 but there is a downside to that. (They can bank while pking) But you can just add makeGlobalObject(Xcoord, Ycoord, itemid, 0,-1,-2,-3(explained lower), 10);<br>
keep the 10 the same; all this does is tell the server that its not a wall or something like that.<br>
0,-1,-2, or -3 explained. This just simply tells what direction this faces, 0= west -1= north -2= east -3= south.<br>
If you need any help just post here</p>

              <p>yea well first go to client.java and search makeglobalobject then copy one of the item lines like for example:          makeGlobalObject(2510, 3863, 2783, -3, 10);// Anvil    then press enter then paster it below then change the name: Anvil to Bank then change the i tem code: 2783 to watever the bank item coode is then change coords: 2510,  first one is x second  is y  and the -3 or watever urs is is the way the bank is gonna be facing, or an easier way to do this is search the makeglobalobject then search bank and copy that then paster below and just change coords <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
