Before I give you any tips, I have to say that depending on the gym, you could either have too many alternatives or too few. There is always going to be one piece of equipment at minimum that will work the muscle group you are targeting, but it is important to understand that a lot of the alternatives are simply going to boil down to preference. I would suggest going to <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.bodybuilding.com</a> and looking up some beginner workouts. They are usually pretty detailed and have videos demonstrating how to execute the exercise, and some even provide alternatives.</p>
<p>Also, I highly recommend you make cardio something you do on a daily basis, as it is not only vital to the development of aerobic ability, but will play a key role in dropping your bf%. I actually have a workout I would suggest you take a look at (it’s the current plan I’m using), as it has a lot of information about the exercise program, nutrition, etc. It’s one of the best programs I’ve come across, although it might not necessarily be for a beginner, I think it would be a great starting point for research, and potentially, learning exercises.<br>
<a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/jim-stoppani-six-week-shortcut-to-shred-training-overview.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/jim-stoppani-six-week-shortcut-to-shred-training-overview.html</a><br>
[/quote]Yes, there are plenty of machines for every body part. Mix those with cables and free weights and you never get bored. <a href="http://bodybuilding.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Bodybuilding.com</a> is actually like my favorite site and it’s where my workouts came from. I say came from because I’ve switched them up and started throwing my own exercises into the mix, like replacing flat bench with inline bench, doing inclined dumbbell press, etc… and then adding machines. Machines are great for <span class="bbcode-i">supplemental exercises</span> (in my opinion) because they almost assure you you’re working what you’re trying to work. So if you do bent-over rows and feel like maybe your form wasn’t the best but already completed 4 sets, you hop in the equivalent machine and do 3 or 4 sets.</p>
<p>You don’t have to remind me about cardio. Every day I’ve gone I’ve warmed up with a mile and am now finishing in under 9 minutes - a couple times even under 8. As for that plan you linked, it really doesn’t sound like my type. I’d much rather watch my macros, get cardio over with at the beginning of my workout, and then just pump iron for the next hour. Although, I’m thinking of turning one of my rest days into a cardio day, where I run more than a mile, or try to burn like 1000 calories or something, but I’m afraid that would just burn muscle.[/quote]<br>
It is highly unlikely you will burn muscle. Also, that is a lot of calories to burn, so expect to being running some pretty long distance mileage, or intensive short distance (~3-4 miles).</p>

I finally maxed out the treadmill today at 10mph during the last .1 miles and it felt like near sprinting, so surely if you work your way up to running the mile at that pace (6 minutes, good lord) you can get some serious cardio work. Was the cycling you did on an actual bike or the machine? I used to bike 16 miles a day for school but it never felt like it got my heart going as much as running did.</p>
