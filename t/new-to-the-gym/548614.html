        <p>First off, I’m completely aware of the fitness thread. Thanks.</p>
<p>Just some back story stuff, a couple days ago I purchased gym membership to continue losing fat and start building muscle. Over the past 6 months, I’ve lost just over 40 lbs and am at 160 now, with a body fat % of 18.8. I talked to a guy there, and my goal should be roughly 8%. Rather than do cardio to lose it all, he said to do lots of muscle-building/strength exercises so the fat eventually burns itself off.</p>
<p>So I thought OK, I’ve lifted weights for about two years in high school so I think I can manage keeping track of a full-body workout (not that I can afford the outrageous price of a personal trainer anyways). But last night I went and exercised for the first time, following a routine I found that splits full body into 5 days, but it didn’t go as I had planned. Initially, it started off alright, since it was all benching and free-weight exercises, but then it started listing machine exercises and there had to have been like 20 different machines and lots of them.</p>
<p>When I went, it was very late and there was almost nobody there, so I couldn’t just watch someone else or ask. Specifically, “cable crossovers”. I found the machines, but the right side didn’t have the right (or same) part you grab onto. It looked like the bar you use for pulling the weight down to your legs when sitting (I don’t know the name). Then I moved onto dips, but couldn’t find dipping machines, but probably just didn’t look hard enough. I prefer not to use a bench.</p>
<p>Another problem I had is adjusting the inclined benches. I saw little knobs and such to adjust them, but the bench seemed pretty resistive and I didn’t want to mess anything up so I just worked with it somewhat too low.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">TL;DR</span><br>
Anyways, I’d like to get some advice from people who were brand new to the gym at one point, had never used anything other than free weights, and can’t afford a personal trainer. It’s very intimidating to go during the day when I’m assuming there are lots of other people, so I’d prefer to go at night when I not only feel better but get to experiment without feeling like I’m keeping anyone waiting.</p>
<p>Also, is it common to see people at the gym who look like they have no idea what they’re doing? It seems like everyone who attends is crazy fit and knows what they’re doing. But everyone has to start somewhere I guess.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>~Lin</p>

This. It’s even better if you’re at a university gym, but only a real ass hole is going to scrutinize how/what someone does. Also, I wouldn’t suggest cutting out cardio completely. If you have the time to do it, just warm up with a mile or two on an elliptical; they’re going to save you from banging up your knees over time and iirc burn more calories per hour than treadmills. If you want to learn how to use a new machine, youtube is honestly your friend. I found out how to properly use equipment that would have otherwise resulted in hurting my lumbar.</p>

If you feel like the machines confuse you and there are too many to get to grips with, people are out there who have trained their entire life with free weights and there are others out there who have done it all using their own body weight even. If you’re interested in any of those, just search for a <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/rudy6.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">free weight plan</a> or a good <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/wotw2.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">callisthenics workout</a>.</p>

If you have the time to do it, just warm up with a mile or two on an elliptical; they’re going to save you from banging up your knees over time and iirc burn more calories per hour than treadmills. If you want to learn how to use a new machine, youtube is honestly your friend. I found out how to properly use equipment that would have otherwise resulted in hurting my lumbar.[/quote]Thanks for this. While I tried out the elliptical machine and couldn’t figure out how to turn it on, running like a mile and a half on the treadmill really helped. It didn’t occur to me until I was leaving that the elliptical machines were powered by your movements… lol. The YouTube part was the best advice, and so was looking things up on Google.</p>
<p>[quote=“Yz85Racer, post:4, topic:548614”]People will respect you for starting and learning, more than people who don’t even bother.[/quote]This actually helped a lot. I ended up asking some buff dude where you get barbells to do bent-over rows and he sat for like a minute, giving me advice, and then even came over to the rack to make sure I was able to get started. Then when I was still trying to figure things out after he left, some other guy came over to me and showed me what I was doing wrong.</p>
<p>[quote=“Ruby, post:5, topic:548614”]When I first started I was that guy who thought all these ripped meatheads were gonna be taking pictures of me and being like “look how clueless this fat fudge is” but it really wasn’t the case. If you feel like the machines confuse you and there are too many to get to grips with, people are out there who have trained their entire life with free weights and there are others out there who have done it all using their own body weight even. If you’re interested in any of those, just search for a <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/rudy6.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">free weight plan</a> or a good <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/wotw2.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">callisthenics workout</a>.[/quote]Yeah, as it turns out, all of the machines are pretty self-explanatory and the ones with confusing parts usually have instructions. Heh.</p>

        <p>Happy to help. Honestly just updating progress on the fitness thread Frell created really helped me maintain momentum. I live a perfectly regular life still in terms of eating what I want when I want, I just try to sometimes go for better alternatives or smaller portions, and I still have lost 25 pounds after putting on muscle since July.</p>
<p>I have pretty much cut out McDonalds completely though, always get spicy chicken sandwich from Wendys instead of baconator, and always go for medium size instead of large. If you’re not trying to be hardcore about it, choose one fast food place you love the most and don’t sacrifice it. For me, it’s Chic-Fil-A. It’s the only place I will get 8-piece nuggets with a large coke and waffle fries lol. Just remember, it’s calories in vs calories out.</p>
<p>Oh, and when you’re at home cut the soda and energy drinks out of your life. Switch to filtered water and lipton tea with 1 Stevia sugar packet. Most people seem to hate drinking regular water, so tea with Stevia packet is a way to get around that and only taking in 15 calories. I’ve also cut beer out at home and moved to mixed drinks like Cranberry and Vodka.</p>

<p>When I was at my peak, 175 pounds and less than 10% bodyfat I could bench 250 and do 100+ pushups in a row. I could run a mile in 6:30. I had started out in terrible physical shape, ex-smoker and malnourished.</p>
<p>It’s all about numbers. I never ate sugary treats, I avoided products with “Enriched wheat” “High Fructose Corn Syrup” or sweeteners. I ate vegetables, whole grains, meat, yogurt, milk, protein shakes. I worked out 1.5 hours every other day. Basically a quick run so I was fired up, then right into sets after sets of heavy weight and high reps. Monday was chest day, Wednesday I did back and legs, then Friday I hit my arms and maybe did abs. Sometimes I did two days on, to shock my muscles and confuse them. Sometimes I would skip the workout and just do some light cardio and stretch, sometimes I did circuit training or martial arts. At the end of every workout I did a “Suicide” style workout where I made sure that I had worked my muscles until they were screaming for oxygen, so I knew I had torn new mass every workout.</p>
<p>That’s just my personal fitness journey, everybody is different. I wanted to train for crossfit or something like that, but I ended up just enjoying the process. I think exercise makes you happy, as well as helping you shape your appearance and physique, so I highly recommend you get some good books and follow a set exercise routine and dietary guidelines.  Best of luck!</p>

<p>In case anyone is wondering, progress is going very well. I miss food, unfortunately, but I’ve been writing down the weights I use and have increased dramatically.

Everything about it is awesome <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>As far as other progress, my cardio performance has gotten much better too. I initially started with mostly fast walking and jogging around 5mph, just barely scratching 6mph sometimes, with my heart rate being just over 200. Today I ran over half my mile at 7.5 mph and the rest at 6.0-7.0, with my heart rate being in the upper 180s. Overall I have a lot more energy and it’s feeling really good to be improving this much in just the beginning of week 4. Thanks everyone for the advice!</p>

Today I ran over half my mile at 7.5 mph and the rest at 6.0-7.0, with my heart rate being in the upper 180s. Overall I have a lot more energy and it’s feeling really good to be improving this much in just the beginning of week 4. Thanks everyone for the advice![/quote]<br>
Perhaps try wide stance squats, move the bar lower/higher, try and find what isn’t hurting your back. Make sure you’re pivoting at your hips, as if you’re sitting back on a chair. There’s a fair bit of strain on lower back in squats, but only in stabilization. If it’s hurting I’d suggest talking to a PT even (most don’t know what they’re talking about, but they’re probably better at helping you in THIS situation than we are)</p>

It currently rests mostly on muscle, but then again my back problems are probably muscle-related (I had a bad chair for a long time and it fucked up my posture, and now I can never be comfortable period). My lower back hurts easily, especially when doing bent-over rows, but I’m hoping that will fade with time as I continue to work it. I’ll try the bar thing out, since I don’t want to give up squats, but it probably won’t be any use since correct form isn’t the issue here.</p>

        <p>First of all 8% body fat is going to take a strict diet and an intense workout plan. Normal everyday people dont wwalk around at 8%. The instructor or watever is already giving you unrealestic goals.</p>
<p>There are plenty of websites around that offer examles of different workout routines. <a href="http://animalpack.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">animalpack.com</a> and <a href="http://outlawmuscle.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">outlawmuscle.com</a> are by far the best ones that ive found in regards to being instructional and the fitness community are overall helpful.</p>
<p>Personally, id recommend you starting out with a 3 day split, yu want to master the basics and get a good foundation before you incorporatre a lot of isolation exercises.  For examle: Monday : Chest, Wednesday Shoulders/legs, Friday : Back.  Stick to basic compound lifts at first.</p>

        <p>Before I give you any tips, I have to say that depending on the gym, you could either have too many alternatives or too few. There is always going to be one piece of equipment at minimum that will work the muscle group you are targeting, but it is important to understand that a lot of the alternatives are simply going to boil down to preference. I would suggest going to <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.bodybuilding.com</a> and looking up some beginner workouts. They are usually pretty detailed and have videos demonstrating how to execute the exercise, and some even provide alternatives.</p>
<p>Also, I highly recommend you make cardio something you do on a daily basis, as it is not only vital to the development of aerobic ability, but will play a key role in dropping your bf%. I actually have a workout I would suggest you take a look at (it’s the current plan I’m using), as it has a lot of information about the exercise program, nutrition, etc. It’s one of the best programs I’ve come across, although it might not necessarily be for a beginner, I think it would be a great starting point for research, and potentially, learning exercises.<br>

<a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/jim-stoppani-six-week-shortcut-to-shred-training-overview.html%5B/quote%5DYes" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/jim-stoppani-six-week-shortcut-to-shred-training-overview.html[/quote]Yes</a>, there are plenty of machines for every body part. Mix those with cables and free weights and you never get bored. <a href="http://bodybuilding.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Bodybuilding.com</a> is actually like my favorite site and it’s where my workouts came from. I say came from because I’ve switched them up and started throwing my own exercises into the mix, like replacing flat bench with inline bench, doing inclined dumbbell press, etc… and then adding machines. Machines are great for <span class="bbcode-i">supplemental exercises</span> (in my opinion) because they almost assure you you’re working what you’re trying to work. So if you do bent-over rows and feel like maybe your form wasn’t the best but already completed 4 sets, you hop in the equivalent machine and do 3 or 4 sets.</p>
<p>You don’t have to remind me about cardio. Every day I’ve gone I’ve warmed up with a mile and am now finishing in under 9 minutes - a couple times even under 8. As for that plan you linked, it really doesn’t sound like my type. I’d much rather watch my macros, get cardio over with at the beginning of my workout, and then just pump iron for the next hour. Although, I’m thinking of turning one of my rest days into a cardio day, where I run more than a mile, or try to burn like 1000 calories or something, but I’m afraid that would just burn muscle.</p>
