    <description>--- I DID NOT CODE THIS SOURCE! THEREFORE I AM NOT TAKING CREDIT FOR WHO IT BELONGS TO ---
Did you ever play DarkQuest? Notice how it was only up for a little while? Such a great server, gone so suddenly.
This of course was over a year ago. I am not peeter or pets nor am I claiming their hard work as my own. I am Cody, and I am the owner of DarkQuest Community. If you want to come play, it&#39;s up 24/7 except some restarts for updates. The server has all skills working except Thieving and Agility. There is no set XP rate, as all skills are set differently. Do you like PKing/Staking/Monster Hunting? Getting 99 flats is definitely going to take more than a day or 2, so It&#39;s not something that can be done without effort. Do you like Skilling/Talking with other people? Come give it a try, who knows you might actually like it. The server is 2 days old already, so come catch up and take your spot. forgot to mention, most, if not all skills are batched by the load, once your full it stops.

Here is a compilation of pictures I quickly put together for you guys

<p>Like Luke said, It is his Server, So some people may of helped with certain aspects of the game, But its still his Server.</p>
<p>As for the RSC Community, It is decreasing but it is not dead, And if it was not for RSCE then it would of been dead long ago.</p>

<p>How is DDoSing “doing the community a favour”? The whole reason these servers are so short lasting is <span class="bbcode-b">because of the attacks.</span> Whoever is doing this is killing any gameplay outside of official RSC and RSCE. RSC is full of greedy jew stakers and RSCE is full of Finnish “hardcore PKer” twats, so the community has gone to shit. Maybe if RSCE had some competition we’d see a bit of improvement in the community.</p>
<p>Oh and see this:</p>

              <p>[quote=“zen420, post:16, topic:434888”]Kryp-fish-dix is making himself into a joke in the rsc “community” by destroying it. Not only is he tyrannical enough to be fearful of ANY competition besides Real RSC, but he has continued to show that he doesn’t really care that he is becoming increasingly unpopular…</p>
<p>Not trying to provoke him or his minions, but c’mon… if I’m not mistaken RSCE is hosted from the USA, and Kryptix is against democracy of RSC PS’S…</p>
<p>I hope this server sticks around, but if it went away… it would just be another 1-3 week server that was 10x better than rsce or and RSCDaemon that may be coming out (HAPPY TROLLING) &gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;[/quote]</p>
<p>Luke has no need to to DDos any attempt of private servers that are released, Even if he was the one taking down servers, He’s doing the community a favour in getting rid of these servers that always end up unsecure, unstable &amp; have a short life expectancy.</p>
<p>The reason why the community dies is people get fed up of wasting there time on these servers that have no potential life span.</p>
<p>Luke has had his server up for 2 years now, Its the longest running &amp; most reliable secure server ever to be released upon the RSC community.</p>
<p>If it was not for Luke i suspect the community would of been dead along time ago, Because you dont see anyone doing near as much as Luke has done.</p>
<p>The community is split between there opinions of how Luke works, But if it wasnt for him you would not have a game to play. Show some appreciation.</p>

<p>So, just to amuse us, speculate, if its not you, who else would even KNOW about the server that would profit from taking it down?</p>

</aside>
<p>We’ve already established that it makes no difference to me whether it’s up or down. I rarely speak to anyone else in the scene so I have no idea, all my available time is being invested into RSCDaemon. People were attacked before I started messing around with private servers and people will still get attacked when I stop. Idiots like yourself have incredibly narrow vision and you can only see the most obvious and predictable option. Just because someone attacks Facebook doesn’t mean that it HAS to be the Twitter founder.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>‘Idiots like yourself’ fail to see that you’re the only one with motive. Also, the reason you aren’t being listened to is because… I don’t know, maybe lying exists? Maybe because of your malicious past? Maybe it’s because you’re shady as fuck?</p>
<p>You stop being narrow minded and look from another point of view.[/quote]<br>
I fail to see how Kryptix would be the only one with a motive to DDoS other servers. We talked about a server a couple months ago like RSChill that got DDoSed all the time and it turned out that a player from another competing server at the time (not RSCE) had been doing it from a single IP (could have been from multiples, w/e). The people that I see who would do shit like this are just people who want more players on the server they play on, whether it’s a random player or the admin of that server. I highly doubt Kryptix gives a shit at this point about a couple new servers coming out recently as he seems to be 100% focused on RSCDaemon.</p>
<p>The question could be asked is it a player from RSCE? Maybe, but that has nothing to do with Kryptix. It’s just getting old seeing people blame Kryptix for every single DDoS attack that goes on.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Outspoken, post:5, topic:435022”]It’s part of your responsibility to keep your server online. If there’s nothing else that you can do to prevent your server going offline then you have fulfilled that responsibility. You’re still at blame for doing the best you can? Your logic baffles me…</p>
<p>Being at risk of another long post by you, I’m going to end it here and walk away. I’m just going to say, just because you try and twist logic doesn’t make that logic correct. Also it is factual in most cases of DDoS. Tewl was a perfect example of that…[/quote]<br>
I’ll dumb it down in a way that you can understand.</p>
<p>If I’m hosting a RSC private server on my own PC and I get attacked by a single IP I should have the resources to fight it.<br>
If I’m hosting a RSC private server on a dedicated PC and go through an attack that takes the game down but doesn’t eat up all the bandwidth I should be able to sort this with code optimisation.</p>
<p>If, however, I’m going through an attack so large that it takes Facebook down, there’s very little I can do without serious funding.</p>
<p>If he had more knowledge than he does he could keep the server online, but instead he has little to no knowledge and when the server goes down he simply just puts the blame on DDoS. If there’s literally nothing that can be done then fine, but there’s lots that can be done, he just doesn’t know how to do them.</p>
<p>Can you understand that or do I need to keep drilling it into your head?</p>
