        <p>I’d just like to see who you would all blame if I wasn’t here. That would create an interesting read.</p>
<p>Do you guys honestly think that I feel threatened about someone downloading the DQ source and hosting it with no modifications on their home PC with zero programming/administrative experience? Why would I care whether or not it’s online? As you said, it being down or up won’t make any difference to RSCE’s online count.</p>
<p>As I’ve said countless times on here, you can’t blame everything on DDoS. It’s the administrators duty to protect against attacks. If I hosted RSCE off my own PC it would also be down all the time but you can’t live life hoping someone else doesn’t do something. You wouldn’t leave your door wide open on your house, you would lock it to ensure no one can get in.</p>
<p>It’s his responsibility to keep it online. Blame him, not the person attacking it.</p>
<p>It’s honestly like me giving everyone root access to RSCE’s box and asking everyone nicely not to do anything malicious. If someone did do something malicious am I meant to blame them for the death of RSCE or am I meant to blame myself for being stupid enough to let everyone have access? Think about it carefully.</p>
<p>Everyone knows without some form of DDoS protection it’s effortless to bring a server down with a 10$ booter so it’s exactly the same thing. If you’re not protecting your server you can’t just ask people nicely not to attack it… Imagine if everyone was that stupid…</p>

<p>We’ve already established that it makes no difference to me whether it’s up or down. I rarely speak to anyone else in the scene so I have no idea, all my available time is being invested into RSCDaemon. People were attacked before I started messing around with private servers and people will still get attacked when I stop. Idiots like yourself have incredibly narrow vision and you can only see the most obvious and predictable option. Just because someone attacks Facebook doesn’t mean that it HAS to be the Twitter founder.</p>

<p>You’re right, it’s easier to blame someone else, however that doesn’t mean that ‘someone else’ isn’t the one to blame. If a murderer broke into your house and killed you, is it your fault for not having a gun? Who’s to blame here?</p>

</aside>
<p>Usually ensuring your doors and windows are locked is sufficient just like my DDoS protection is sufficient to keep my server online. If the unusual happened and I was attacked with far more power than I usually am and RSCEmulation went down then yes it would still be my fault for not being prepared but it would also be understandable considering it’s a one off. If someone broke into your house using force even thought you left your house secured properly then it would be one of those occasions. You can’t protect yourself from everything, if my server went through the kind of attacks Facebook goes through there would be nothing I could do, just like there would be nothing I could do if my house was being attacked by a tank.</p>
<p>However, no doubt the attack(s) he’s going through are minute and there’s very much he can do. From the first day we ever went online (hosting RSCEmulation on GaWdZ’ PC) we were dealing with attacks and was forced to purchase a dedicated server and optimise our server code. It’s been a long process and I’ve lost many nights sleep fighting attacks so it’s pretty frustrating when someone downloads DQ, hosts it on their own PC and then blames someone who isn’t even behind the attack because they’re incapable of preventing it.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Outspoken, post:5, topic:435022”]It’s part of your responsibility to keep your server online. If there’s nothing else that you can do to prevent your server going offline then you have fulfilled that responsibility. You’re still at blame for doing the best you can? Your logic baffles me…</p>
<p>Being at risk of another long post by you, I’m going to end it here and walk away. I’m just going to say, just because you try and twist logic doesn’t make that logic correct. Also it is factual in most cases of DDoS. Tewl was a perfect example of that…[/quote]<br>
I’ll dumb it down in a way that you can understand.</p>
<p>If I’m hosting a RSC private server on my own PC and I get attacked by a single IP I should have the resources to fight it.<br>
If I’m hosting a RSC private server on a dedicated PC and go through an attack that takes the game down but doesn’t eat up all the bandwidth I should be able to sort this with code optimisation.</p>
<p>If, however, I’m going through an attack so large that it takes Facebook down, there’s very little I can do without serious funding.</p>
<p>If he had more knowledge than he does he could keep the server online, but instead he has little to no knowledge and when the server goes down he simply just puts the blame on DDoS. If there’s literally nothing that can be done then fine, but there’s lots that can be done, he just doesn’t know how to do them.</p>
<p>Can you understand that or do I need to keep drilling it into your head?</p>

<p>So, just to amuse us, speculate, if its not you, who else would even KNOW about the server that would profit from taking it down?</p>

</aside>
<p>We’ve already established that it makes no difference to me whether it’s up or down. I rarely speak to anyone else in the scene so I have no idea, all my available time is being invested into RSCDaemon. People were attacked before I started messing around with private servers and people will still get attacked when I stop. Idiots like yourself have incredibly narrow vision and you can only see the most obvious and predictable option. Just because someone attacks Facebook doesn’t mean that it HAS to be the Twitter founder.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>‘Idiots like yourself’ fail to see that you’re the only one with motive. Also, the reason you aren’t being listened to is because… I don’t know, maybe lying exists? Maybe because of your malicious past? Maybe it’s because you’re shady as fuck?</p>
<p>You stop being narrow minded and look from another point of view.[/quote]<br>
I fail to see how Kryptix would be the only one with a motive to DDoS other servers. We talked about a server a couple months ago like RSChill that got DDoSed all the time and it turned out that a player from another competing server at the time (not RSCE) had been doing it from a single IP (could have been from multiples, w/e). The people that I see who would do shit like this are just people who want more players on the server they play on, whether it’s a random player or the admin of that server. I highly doubt Kryptix gives a shit at this point about a couple new servers coming out recently as he seems to be 100% focused on RSCDaemon.</p>
<p>The question could be asked is it a player from RSCE? Maybe, but that has nothing to do with Kryptix. It’s just getting old seeing people blame Kryptix for every single DDoS attack that goes on.</p>

<p>Not trying to provoke him or his minions, but c’mon… if I’m not mistaken RSCE is hosted from the USA, and Kryptix is against democracy of RSC PS’S…</p>
<p>I hope this server sticks around, but if it went away… it would just be another 1-3 week server that was 10x better than rsce or and RSCDaemon that may be coming out (HAPPY TROLLING) &gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;[/quote]</p>
<p>Luke has no need to to DDos any attempt of private servers that are released, Even if he was the one taking down servers, He’s doing the community a favour in getting rid of these servers that always end up unsecure, unstable &amp; have a short life expectancy.</p>
<p>The reason why the community dies is people get fed up of wasting there time on these servers that have no potential life span.</p>
<p>Luke has had his server up for 2 years now, Its the longest running &amp; most reliable secure server ever to be released upon the RSC community.</p>
<p>If it was not for Luke i suspect the community would of been dead along time ago, Because you dont see anyone doing near as much as Luke has done.</p>
<p>The community is split between there opinions of how Luke works, But if it wasnt for him you would not have a game to play. Show some appreciation.</p>

Now theres a bunch of kids who Ddos, Its not hard &amp; you only had to do a minor bit of research to setup a Botnet, We could point the finger allday, Theres a bunch of kids who have nothing else to do who just feel the need to Ddos somebody. And these new servers being setup with the lack of security are easy targets for anybody. Hence why they get hit, But people are so quick to point the finger in Lukes direction, He does not need to attack these servers? There no competition to him.</p>

I think he meant that the RSC Community is pretty much dead for a long time, those players you have are most likely from RS2 and gold farmers.</p>

<p>I can see by this reply you have no idea what you are talking about, And my points were 100% accurate.</p>
<p>Like Luke said, It is his Server, So some people may of helped with certain aspects of the game, But its still his Server.</p>
<p>As for the RSC Community, It is decreasing but it is not dead, And if it was not for RSCE then it would of been dead long ago.</p>
<p>Troll’s cant be helped, Thats how the internet community is nowadays, And so what, You should not let yourself get worked up about a kid trolling you.</p>
