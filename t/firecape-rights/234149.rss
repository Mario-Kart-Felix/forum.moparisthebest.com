    <title>Firecape Rights</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/firecape-rights/234149</link>
    <description>Ok, so what I have done was if you kill the jad you will become &quot;Jadkill  = 1&quot;. So if you didn&#39;t kill the jad you would be 0. I made this so if you kill him once, you do not have to kill him again and so I can put it in a shop for those who has killed the jad. Added all the ints, all saves, everything works fine, no errors. My problem is applying it to the firecape. I&#39;m having trouble here. On my first code, I made it like this:

[code]				if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 2773 == true) // 
					{
					if(Jadkill == 1);
					updateRequired = true;
					appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}
else {
ItemHandler.removeItem(playerEquipment[playerWeapon], absX, absY, 1);
sendMessage(&quot;You have not defeated the Jad, you are not able to wield a firecape&quot;);
}[/code]
No errors except when you wear it, the else works, like it sends the message, but I can&#39;t get it to make it so you can&#39;t wear the firecape because it still allows you to. After going through a couple times, I noticed I used &quot;[playerWeapon]&quot; so I changed the code to

[code]				if(playerEquipment[playerCape] == 2773 == true) // 
					{
					if(Jadkill == 1);
					updateRequired = true;
					appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}
else {
ItemHandler.removeItem(playerEquipment[playerCape], absX, absY, 1);
sendMessage(&quot;You have not defeated the Jad, you are not able to wield a firecape&quot;);
}[/code]

But now, the else doesn&#39;t even work now, it doesn&#39;t send the message. If anyone can give me a better method of doing this it would be greatly appreciated  :)</description>
