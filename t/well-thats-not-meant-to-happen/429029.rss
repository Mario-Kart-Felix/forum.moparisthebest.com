    <title>Well thats not meant to happen</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/well-thats-not-meant-to-happen/429029</link>
    <description>well, here is the story so far. i have my server which has been working fine for weeks and weeks, but i just came across a massive, massive problem five minutes ago.

when you go to sign into your/somebody elses account, you can use any password you want, it will work.

say i wanted to log in to cheesestick101&#39;s account, and his password was sausage.

i could easily just type in;

username:   cheesestick101
password:   wrongpassword

this would log me into his account, leaving me free to do whatever i wanted, and kicking him from his account. passwords are non existant. 

as amazing as it is that nobody has noticed this, could somebody please post some help of how to fix this? thankyou so much. dillon.</description>
