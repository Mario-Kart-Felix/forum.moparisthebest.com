    <title>US Government sues Apple for ebook pricing conspiracy</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Apple and several of the nation&#39;s largest book publishers were hit with a federal antitrust lawsuit on Wednesday for allegedly colluding to fix e-book prices.
According to the complaint, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, at least five publishers—Simon &amp; Schuster, HarperCollins, Hachette, Penguin and Macmillan—conspired with Apple to fix prices for e-books ahead of the 2010 launch of the iPad tablet and iBookstore, forcing Amazon to raise prices for e-books on the rival Kindle.
Simon &amp; Schuster, HarperCollins and Hachette have already settled with the Justice Department. According to Bloomberg, Apple and Macmillan &quot;have refused to engage in settlement talks&quot; and &quot;deny they colluded to raise prices for digital books.&quot; Penguin plans to fight the lawsuit too, Bloomberg said.
Before the iPad came along, publishers had complained that Amazon&#39;s $9.99 price for e-books was too heavily discounted. When the iPad made its debut, most e-books sold by Apple were priced at $12.99, with the Cupertino, Calif.-based company allowing publishers to set their own prices—known as the &quot;agency model.&quot; Amazon soon allowed publishers to set their own prices, too, driving up the prices of digital editions.
&quot;Apple facilitated the [publishers&#39;] collective effort to end retail price competition by coordinating their transition to an agency model across all retailers,&quot; the suit alleges.
A class action lawsuit filed in California District Court last summer by Kindle consumers was the first to allege a conspiracy, CNNMoney.com noted. According to that suit, &quot;booksellers were &#39;terrified&#39; by the discounted e-book price structure Amazon launched in 2007.&quot; The &quot;spooked publishers&quot; colluded with Apple to force Amazon&#39;s hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
