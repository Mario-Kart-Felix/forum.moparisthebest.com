    <title>Has anyone in here worked with QnX?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/has-anyone-in-here-worked-with-qnx/6438</link>
    <description>QNX is an RTOS (real time operating system) and is mainly used for embedded applications.  It&#39;s very portable (will fit on a floppy disk WITH a gui) and yet very powerful.  I&#39;m working on building a small os image for a PC104 board with a compact flash IDE device.  Just looking to see if anyone in here has any experience in it.  I&#39;m having some trouble with creating a .boot file that actually works and the forums I&#39;ve found that deal with it specifically have turned out to be rather useless.</description>
