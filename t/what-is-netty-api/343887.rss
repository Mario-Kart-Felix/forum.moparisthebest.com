    <title>What is &quot;Netty api&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-netty-api/343887</link>
    <description>Since I&#39;m trying to learn Java more efficiently and actually try to, I just want to know what is Netty API?
I&#39;ve heard so much about it in a few base servers, can anyone explain?</description>

              <p>while we’re on the topic of MINA, does the ‘keep-alive’ connection support not annoy you fuckers</p>
<p>anyways as for the topic, i never use an actual networking library that interfaces with the NIO api since id much rather make my own networking implementation with NIO</p>

<p>[quote author=Trustin Lee]<br>
MINA has more out-of-the-box features at the cost of complexity and relatively poor performance. Some of those features were integrated into the core too tightly to be removed even if they are not needed by a user. In Netty, I tried to address such design issues while retaining the known strengths of MINA.</p>
<p>Currently, most features available in MINA are also available in Netty. In my opinion, Netty has cleaner and more documented API since Netty is the result of trying to rebuild MINA from scratch and address the known issues. If you find that an essential feature is missing, please feel free to post your suggestion to the forum. I’d be glad to address your concern.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that Netty has faster development cycle. Simply, check out the release date of the recent releases. Also, you should consider that MINA team will proceed to a major rewrite, MINA 3, which means they will break the API compatibility completely.<br>

              <p>It’s a networking API like MINA.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering what an API is, think of it this way: “Plugins” for your software - also known as “Libraries”</p>
<p>If you are wanting to make an MSN chat bot, you would use the JML API to create a new messenger factory that is used by your bot.</p>
<p>NOTE: I do not know how to create APIs, but do know how to use them. If you need help you can contact me through Private Message.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
