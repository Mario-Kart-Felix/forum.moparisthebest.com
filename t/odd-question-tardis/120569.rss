    <title>Odd question...Tardis</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/odd-question-tardis/120569</link>
    <description>Really odd question, but it was bugging me while i was watching tv... Can any one explain the limits to the TARDIS&#39;s powers. I mean the TARDIS from doctor who, i was watching the show and i realized the doctor actually worries about people, why would he if he has a time machine, couldn&#39;t he just go back to before they were hurt and save them? He explained but he said it very fast and i did not catch what he said... So my question is just what can&#39;t the TARDIS do and why, thanks for reading...</description>

              <p>Yea that was the line, but right before he said that he mentioned something about not being able to do something with it when she asked why he didn’t just go back and tell her not to go to work…</p>

              <p>i have nfi cos im not a huge fan of doctor who, but i think he said something along the lines of ‘i am not allowed to, with the exception of cheap tricks’, though i must admit if thats the same line, i wasnt listening properly at the time <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
