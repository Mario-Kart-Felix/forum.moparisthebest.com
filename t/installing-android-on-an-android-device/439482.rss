    <title>Installing Android on an Android Device</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/installing-android-on-an-android-device/439482</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking to download, and build the Android kernel, and put it on my Galaxy S2. Now, while it already has Android on it, I&#39;d like to remove a lot of the bloatware. Now this could easily be done by rooting my phone, but I would like to experiment more than simply rooting my phone. I just have a few questions.

Could it void my warranty? (It probably should, since I&#39;m going outside the manufacturers bounds)
Would there be any compatibility issues? (existing apps not functioning correctly, even with the same API)
Assuming I installed a &quot;fallback&quot; kernel, along with a bootloader, would it be easier to &quot;brick&quot; my phone?
In the event that I do &quot; brick&quot; my phone, would it be possible to boot a &quot;LiveCD&quot; via USB?

Also, have any of you had experience with this sort of thing?</description>

<p>You are going to have to ‘root’ your phone to do that anyhow, and all you are doing is building another ROM like the likes of Cyanogenmod to put on your phone.  In fact, I’d start out with Cyanogenmod and change from there.  Do a nandroid backup just like you would before you load any other ROM and if you mess something up, you will be able to quickly and easily revert it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am unable to root my phone. It seems the only Samsung Galaxy S 2s that can be rooted (as of now) are the ones sold by sprint, Samsung, and AT&amp;T. I do not have access to Odin (the Samsung flashing tool), so I built Heimdall (an OS implementation of Odin) which other people have had success with when rooting the SGS2. Apparently there are some T-Mobile specific changes that prevent it from working. I can’t even dump the PIT from my phone.</p>
<p>I’m still looking for alternative means for rooting my phone if anyone has been successful with the SGH-T989.</p>
<p>EDIT: I have been able to root my phone. I got access to a computer with Windows, and was able to root my phone. Now I’m going to follow your suggestion and mess with Cyanogenmod before trying to hack together my own.</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently there has been no Cyanogenmod developed, and no “active” development state for the SGH-T989 since December at least (due to a lack of “donations” from what I can gather).</p>
