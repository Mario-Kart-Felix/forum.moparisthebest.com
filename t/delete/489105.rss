              <p>Hmm, do the following at school. Throw a piece of bubble gum under him just before he goes to sit down. If you have a school uniform with a pocket on the front where his boobs are then grab the pocket and yank it off, if done correctly his boobs will flop out. When he is following you and your friends around get you and your friends to ditch him as a joke, seeming he is fat I assume he is no usaine bolt and wont catch you. Or just decide to do a lot of physical activity with your friends and see if he can keep up. Tell everyone he was jacking off in the bathroom or something. I may sound evil but I was a little rascal in the early days of high school.</p>

I feel like there have been several TV show episodes about this kind of thing. You have to think outside the box and do something that humiliates him in front of people but it doesn’t seem like your fault. An example would be you give him a candy bar but inside of it is something gross that might make him sick or makes him flip out, like there’s a spider on it. When nobody’s around, go up to him and tell him not to mess with you anymore or you’ll do something worse next time. Make him feel smaller than you.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well now that it’s that kind of situation with food, tweak it a little. Put a lock on your pantry door. Say it was your mom’s idea. Take the cheetos out and hide them, or like I said before, do something to the cheetos so next time he eats them he gets sick. When you two are alone, warn him like I said.[/quote]</p>
<p>I like that lock idea, thanks.</p>

<p>No they always bring him along because he buys them things. But he always raids my pantry while he’s here, usually while we’re upstairs. I’ve told him to stop several times, but the situations always the same. I walk into the kitchen to see him chowing down on my stash of Cheetos, tell him to stop, he says alright then repeats the action next time my friends bring him.</p>
