Think about it logically.  If your web browser can render the page for you to see, it must have gotten the source somehow, correct?  Your browser isn’t just guessing what to render, it is being told what to do by SOURCE CODE.  If your browser can get it, you can get it, no exceptions.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Very true, but there are ways of allowing the browser to read the correct code but interpret it differently, so it will display the wrong source to the potential code-thief.[/quote]</p>
<p>No there isn’t; it is NOT POSSIBLE. Quit misinforming people, you idiot.<br>
ps: using the “%xx encoding” doesn’t work. Hi there unescape()</p>

              <p>This thread is quite funny I must say. And watching it play out gave me a bit of entertainment. But in all honesty, Telenim is right. Some scripts taken from other websites, and a bit of HTML, a website does not make. It does, but it’s just not up to the standards held by most members of these forums.</p>
<p>This would make a dandy website for Moparscapers though, which is why it shouldn’t matter what Telenim says. Someone somewhere might want this. You should really work on your design of the webpages before you release another ‘website’. Web Design is a strange art, and isn’t as simple as copying images from other websites.</p>
