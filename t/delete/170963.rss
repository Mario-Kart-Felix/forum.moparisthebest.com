    <description>i was fucked up when i posted this I think. I don&#39;t remember ever coming into the c++ section

[code]#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
    string line;
    int Amount =0;
    int Parts = 0;
    int times=0;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;How many times would you like the loop to run: &quot;;
    getline (cin, line);
    stringstream(line) &gt;&gt; Amount;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;How many parts should each loop have: &quot;;
    getline (cin, line);
    stringstream(line) &gt;&gt; Parts;
        for(int i=1;i &lt;= Amount;i++) {
            for(int b=1;b &lt;= Parts; b++) {
                times++;
                cout&lt;&lt;&quot;The loop has ran &quot;&lt;&lt;i&lt;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&lt;b&lt;&lt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;&lt;Parts&lt;&lt;&quot; times! (#&quot;&lt;&lt;times&lt;&lt;&quot;)\n&quot;;
            }
        }
    cout&lt;&lt;&quot;The loop is finished!\n&quot;;
    system(&quot;pause&quot;);
  return 0;
}
[/code]
