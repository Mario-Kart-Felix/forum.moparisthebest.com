They didn’t create everything thing in their game(s). People say that Jagex is copying WoW’s combat system, no, many other games have had that for some time now. Other games like Skyrim and Dragon Age use a similar one. I haven’t heard or seen anyone saying they copied WoW.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t really agree on that on, the only Influence I could possibly see from D&amp;D would be item stats which is a very basic concept in runescape. there is no feel of dungeon crawling with the exception of one or two quests in classic. I suppose you could go the route that some of the NPC’s are generic D&amp;D mobs but you could basically say it could of been influenced from a Tolkien novel just as easily.</p>

Well I find it to be backwards really. Runescape has had an effect on several games<br>
[/quote]Curious to know which games you had in mind. Also, a game like RS does not just happen. Ideas are progressed or incorporated as they pass from author to author; one just has to be familiar with older games. The ambition of this discussion is to find individuals who have these experiences.[/quote]hmm well there is a  game thread where I was asking for medieval type games that has several related stuff</p>

Back when I first starting playing Runescape the game was very open after tutorial island you had been free to do what you wanted and you had to figure it out yourself just exploring the landscapes.

<p>Seriously, no tutorials. You know how fucking long it took me to learn how to craft? I had 1 crafting for like 8 months.</p>
