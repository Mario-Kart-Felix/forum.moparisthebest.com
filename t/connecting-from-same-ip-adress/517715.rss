    <title>Connecting from same IP adress</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-from-same-ip-adress/517715</link>
    <description>Hey guys! Some I hosted a 742 server yesterday for me, my brother and some of my friends. Everything went well but then I found one problem. I can&#39;t connect to my server with my brother at the same time. It says that there are too many connections from my IP adress. I think that I can change the limit from my source files somewhere but I didn&#39;t find out how to... So if you guys can help me, I would appreciate that. Thank you!  :)</description>
