[s]Hello, Moparians! I am looking for a coder/Co-Owner for my server. The last guy I had took my source (i gave him the incomplete files since I knew the kid was going to run off), and I can&#39;t tolerate the people who do this. If your one of them, leave.

<span class="bbcode-b">Co-Owner</span><br>
Experience: I’ve been an administrator on a few RSPS’s (I’m not sure if it was 3 or 4), I was Co-Owner (and one of the coders) on a RSPS I used to play (the owner stopped hosting the server), I’ve been an in-game moderator on 2-3 RSPS’s, and also a forum moderator. And OFC, most important I’ve owned my own project… So I’ve got some experience. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I’m 15 years old, and I’m mature.</p>
<p>Sadly, I haven’t got Skype so I had to post an “application” here on MoparScape.<br>
If you would like to contact me, then here’s my email-addresses,</p>

Gmail: <a href="mailto:projectpotzon@gmail.com">projectpotzon@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Oh, BTW, I joined the forums yesterday (if I don’t become Co-Owner, then I still want to play). <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

              <p>I will code with you if you’re not completely ignorant. All I’m really trying to do is expand my revision knowledge. I’ll be 18 in two days and you can refer to my signature for proof of work.</p>
<p>Also, you might want to try the “Development Teams” section. Might yield more results.</p>
