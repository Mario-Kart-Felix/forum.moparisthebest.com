    <title>I need help with my webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-my-webclient/424085</link>
    <description>Hello, I have made about 100 web clients in the past, and they all worked. I have quit for a few months, but now i am back.
I don&#39;t think i&#39;m doing anything wrong, i even checked a tutorial to make sure. client is Hybrid PvP v3.
I honestly have tried to make my web client about 35 times now, and every time it says &quot;Could not find main class : Client&quot;.
The main class is in the folder, so i don&#39;t know what is wrong with it.
If anyone knows how to fix it, please tell me.

Thank you, 
Mike</description>
