    <title>Client sizes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-sizes/187131</link>
    <description>[b]whats your client size?[/b]
must include the class size and the java size

[b]class:[/b] 360 kb
[b]java:[/b] 1.13 kb

the better conventions the lower the class size
the java file doesnt determine the lag
its the class file that does

some one could hava a client.java at 500 kb 
and their class at 490 kb 
depending on their conventions

[b]- note[/b]
i used the convention tool that was made by i loot i i think?
my client.java was at 830 kb and the class at 364 kb
when i used it i got the results above</description>
