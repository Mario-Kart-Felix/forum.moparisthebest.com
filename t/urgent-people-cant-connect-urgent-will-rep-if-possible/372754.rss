    <title>[URGENT] People can&#39;t connect! [/URGENT] Will ++Rep if possible</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/urgent-people-cant-connect-urgent-will-rep-if-possible/372754</link>
    <description>Okay guise, basically I can host every other server accept this creative scape base i found, I&#39;m trying to get it online so me and a few friends can explore and edit it (Not for profit good old fun).. I think, although a bit buggy, it is a great server with many fine features.

I myself can connect through local host, but no one else can connect, I CAN HOST OTHER SERVERS PERFECTLY FINE.

I&#39;m just looking for a fix so i can get online, here&#39;s what happens when my friend Daniel tries to connect.

P.S. The login box and Title were changed using &quot;Toms cache suit&quot;, this client IS a webclient (ask for the link and i&#39;ll pm you it through the forums private message system).</description>

              <p>[quote=“deans1243, post:2, topic:372754”]well you say its a web client so if you uploaded the client.jar strait to your webhost then its not on your ip. u have to jar and sign it with your ip.</p>
<p>if there using a desktop client then im sure you know this but just to cover it, make sure you have it set to your no-ip and the port you forwarded.[/quote]</p>
<p>I have jar signed it, edited the client.java to connect to my no-ip address and port forwarded.</p>
