    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mushroom-mission/55884</link>
    <description>You will need:
50 g of Amanita Muscaria (Siberian, smoke dried)
A few of friends
Someone wiht a car on possible hospital duty
A decent Set and Setting
A method of eating them

These are the mushrooms:

This is my chosen method of eating them... PIZZA.

Its currently 14:24 its been 10 mins
I have started the waiting game, i estimate about 80 mins.

Anyone had any musroom experiences?

I will keep all of you who are interested up to date with the results here.</description>

<p>Just to help clear up any confusion, I read up on the effects from them. I think it was unfair how PaulT was comparing them to psilocybin mushroom trip, as I just read off wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>The effects of muscimol are substantially different from psilocybin, as the chemicals target separate parts of the brain. Muscimol has been shown to lack "structured" hallucinations in most cases, and the effects are frequently compared to a lucid dream state.</blockquote>

<p>Ok. I don’t even have to make fun of you, you handle it by yourself.</p>

<p>They can be, but your vague references to undefined basic principles (are you really so obssesed with the language of academia that you can use phrases like this without any context?) and chemistry (without actually mentioning the active ingredients in either shrooms or amanitas) doesn’t support your theory.</p>
<blockquote>That was infact written as a commentary to Strassman, smart arse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Set and setting describes the context for psychoactive and particularly psychedelic drug experiences: one's mindset and the setting in which the user has the experience. This is especially relevant for psychedelic or hallucinogenic experiences; the term was coined by Timothy Leary.</blockquote>

<p>you appear to be just spouting random drug facts at a tangent, that youve read to support an arguement that doesnt exist/that you keep changing. Dude stop arguing, thats not what this post was intended for. It is safe to say, using the affirmation of set/setting/drug, that if you’re hunting for a box in which to place psychedelic spirituality, you can’t just pin it on a drug without also bringing set and setting to bear.</p>

<p>A shrooms trip is eight/twelve hours of intense hallucination and introspection. It could never be described as predictable, and is certainly much less so than an Amanita experience. On shrooms it is possible to forget you are on drugs, who you are, and what you are doing, and become completely involved in recognizing the beautiful patterns of nature.</p>
<p>An amanita trip is extremely mentally relaxing, more like opium than shrooms in many ways, and it does not produce hallucinations or introspection anywhere near the level of shrooms.</p>
<p>Which is better? That’s an opinion.</p>
<p>Which is a more intense and psychedelic experience? Magic mushrooms win over amanitas any day.</p>

<p>I was tripping on shrooms when you were sucking on your mothers tit. Amanita’s are ok and I’ve done them quite a few times, but they are a mild stumble and a waste of money compared to the intense trips that you get from doing real magic mushrooms.</p>

<p>Right, and if you want to trip, take magic mushrooms. Amanitas are an experience, but definitely nothing on the level of shrooms or acid or salvia or methylone or any other of the wacky wonderful ways there are to break down the barriers between mind and matter.</p>
