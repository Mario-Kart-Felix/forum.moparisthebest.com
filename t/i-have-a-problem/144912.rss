    <title>I have a problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-a-problem/144912</link>
    <description>ok this is my problem and i find this reall f**ked up any ways i looked into this and it seems that my server isn&#39;t even reading my client.java i even did some test&#39;s to see what is wrong with it and i deleted client.java from my server folder and i went to compile normally i would get a shit load of errors and my server wouldn&#39;t work but some how i got no errors and i ran the server and the funny thing is my server was up and i logged into it without putting my server ip in or having my client.java in my server folder i know this all sounds weird for u all but it&#39;s the honest to god truth i swear on my dead mothers grave this is happening and it all started to happen when i was testing the teleblock spell to try and get it working again but for the test all i did was i took a &quot;stock untouched&quot; client.java i had from the past from the same source as my server and tryed tb to see if it worked and it did then i went to try and fix the tb on my server&#39;s client.java to see what was wrong so i put my client.java back in &quot;the one i worked on the most&quot; and i edited the teleblock spell and i know it would work after i was done editing and i went to compile and these are the errors i get.....now remember my server f**king runs without my client.java in it and it&#39;m getting creeped out and i by all my server members are mad cause they can&#39;t get on it &quot;i don&#39;t wanna put my server up with this bug&quot; so heres my errors i get when i compile......

u closed the main class too soon look at your first bracket line 0 or line 1? and follow it to very end make sure it closes there<br>
[/quote] ? i didn’t touch my main class and thiers no moved brackets at line 1-10 everything is the same[/quote]</p>
<p>my main class i mean client.java the file you working on if line 1’s bracket doesnt match up with the last bracket in the file than u gotta check the brackets out…  I don’t check every bracket by hand I use EditPadPro its a better notepad made for java I guess, try to get your hands on it than when you install it just drag client.java inside it, it will load it up and click on the first { in your client.java it should be like  public class client {  or something like that just click that { in EditPad Pro and scroll to very bottom you should see the last } highlighted if you don’t it will highlight the wrong part a bit higher so you can find error.<br>
if this hard to read cuz I made it all 1 sentence, i cbf rewritting it.</p>

<li>Not 2 years, 2 days maybe.</li>
<li>You dont know anything about servers.</li>
<li>Dont even say you know “coding”.</li>
<li>If your server can run without client.java and works fine, why not just screw the rest and play it how it is?</li>

              <p>ok this is my problem and i find this reall f<strong>ked up any ways i looked into this and it seems that my server isn’t even reading my client.java i even did some test’s to see what is wrong with it and i deleted client.java from my server folder and i went to compile normally i would get a shit load of errors and my server wouldn’t work but some how i got no errors and i ran the server and the funny thing is my server was up and i logged into it without putting my server ip in or having my client.java in my server folder i know this all sounds weird for u all but it’s the honest to god truth i swear on my dead mothers grave this is happening and it all started to happen when i was testing the teleblock spell to try and get it working again but for the test all i did was i took a “stock untouched” client.java i had from the past from the same source as my server and tryed tb to see if it worked and it did then i went to try and fix the tb on my server’s client.java to see what was wrong so i put my client.java back in “the one i worked on the most” and i edited the teleblock spell and i know it would work after i was done editing and i went to compile and these are the errors i get…now remember my server f</strong>king runs without my client.java in it and it’m getting creeped out and i by all my server members are mad cause they can’t get on it “i don’t wanna put my server up with this bug” so heres my errors i get when i compile…</p>
