    <description>Well I got bored of my old project as it is the same old server that everyone has now-adays. So what I really want to know is what the people of MoparScape think. 

Would you prefer and ol&#39; school server with object training and in Varrock but with much more detail then the one&#39;s before? (One of the most asked about servers from people).

Or 

An economy-based server using the 459 client with the latest item being skill capes.

Either  way both servers will be using the 459 client, so please post you&#39;re opinion, also please don&#39;t post saying a different protocol. Thanks.</description>
