    <title>Kind of newbie question but</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kind-of-newbie-question-but/143256</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m pretty much brand new to this whole Private Server thing. It seems pretty forward except I have a couple of questions that I&#39;m sure some of you can answer  :D

I have acquired an edited source(based off of PimpScape) that has a few extra things such as portals leading to different areas, quick monster spawns, edited item drops, etc.

Now I was wondering how exactly do [i]I[/i] go into my server and see if everything is working that I also added onto the source along with the edits already made? 

When I click the runserver.bat it opens up a console that says: Starting EyreScapePK Server on 0.0.0.0:5555
How would I go about connecting to my source basically or how would I connect my source to a pre-made client.</description>

              <p>Download MoparScape client. Then type in your username and password for the server. Keep the ip: localhost, 127.0.0.1, or 0.0.0.0 and that will work. Change the port to 5555.</p>
