    <title>How many languages do you know?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-many-languages-do-you-know/371064</link>
    <description>[size=18pt]♠[/size]First Don&#39;t put a language unless you trully know it.[size=18pt]♠[/size] 
(that means if all you know how to do, with lets say Java is a RSPS and where you only mess with a few cgf files change some names and other things. without really making some of you own code your do not know that language.)

[s]Me I know 3 languages (soon to be 4, I am learning php right now). HTML, Java, and CSS.[/s]
Okay I know 1, Java. I also know HTML and CSS but as they are not &quot;proper&quot; languages they do not count.
All this said how many do you know?</description>

I believe there is a strong difference between knowing the name of something, and KNOWING something. I’ve written code in many different languages/scripts/markups. To name a few: C, C++, C#, Java, PHP, Javascript, SQL, Perl, Python, CSS, HTML, XHTML, XML, XSD, XSL-FO, XSL-T, Assembly, and Brain Fuck among several others. But I can’t (and won’t) say I KNOW a language.</p>
<p>IMO to say one KNOWS a language implies one knows everything from syntax, to how it gets to machine code.</p>
<p>So… I know none.</p>
<p>[/quote]That is probably the most intelligent post I’ve seen on here for months. :P[/quote]Pretty much the same thing a few other people have said in this topic lol</p>

I’d rather die than be forced to learn a language because someone refuses to learn our language after moving here.<br>

<p>You do realise people were speaking Spanish in America long before the English colonised it? Right?[/quote]<br>
English is the main language now? I don’t care about history, is no way to change what happened. All I am saying, is that they move here willingly, they should attempt to learn it at least. Now if they were forced here, i could understand, but I don’t see any spanish speaking people that didn’t want to be here.</p>
