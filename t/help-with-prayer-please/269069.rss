    <title>Help with prayer please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-prayer-please/269069</link>
    <description>Hi, I am having problems with prayer, every bone that I try will not bury,
standard bones (and those with the same design): nothing happens, no movement, doesn&#39;t bury them, nothing,
ourg bones it says: nothing interesting happens.

and I have a prayer handler, but still nothing happens, I was told it was an easy fix, but i can&#39;t manage to get it working.
Any help would be much appreciated :)

P.S. it&#39;s a 377 or else 317, i forget which one =\</description>
