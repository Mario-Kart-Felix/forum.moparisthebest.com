    <title>Getting quite pissed off.. Help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-quite-pissed-off-help/519406</link>
    <description>So im a co-owner of a server me and a friend decided to host, our last server used deathlypvpz v2, we decided to move up to v4.. so normally everything works fine the first time i code it, well with the v4 Ive had alot more problems, some i easily fixed the rest are just pissing me off.

Its been months since ive coded a Pi, so im a little rusty. im positive the error is on my hands but im not sure where im going wrong.

One of the most annoying is the shops, i cannot buy from the shop at all and im not sure why.. ill post my code from action handler &amp; shop.cfg

[sup]shop = 1	General_Store	2	2	787	100	8007	100[/sup]

[sup]        case 520:
		case 522:
		c.getShops().openShop(1);
		break;[/sup]

the second problem i keep encountering is the worlds, on v2 i could easily disable a world and now i cannot seem to do so, ive searched the entire client files and still nothing, im thinking its in source files, but as i said i have not coded in so long.</description>

<p>perhaps it is being caused by itemdef2 in the client, i changed the names of two items heres the code in itemdef2.</p>
<p>[sup]        if(i == 787)<br>
{<br>
itemdef.name = “<span class="mention">@yel</span>@2b Certificate”;<br>
itemdef.itemActions[1] = “Sell”;<br>
itemdef.description = “Sell this to any store for 2billion coins.”;<br>

<pre><code>    if(i == 8007)
    {
        itemdef.name = "@blu@Home Teletab";
       itemdef.description = "Break this to teleport home";
    }[/sup]
</code></pre>
<p>correction, its not a problem in the client, i removed the itemdef2 and still cannot purchase items. but i can sell items to the store.</p>
