Try making a title that actually has something to do with your post.</p>
<p>Also, due to the title, I can say this without it being spam.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people here who can code, but they are not going to spend their time to prove it to someone who it just being a hypocrite and can’t actually code himself.</p>
<p>Also, it is the fault of people like you that most intelligent people stay away from and leave this forum. There is no reason to insult people whom you don’t even know.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Tbh this isn’t the place to be saying that. Coding a server isn’t real Java… Most of the people here know a little, then back themselves up with a tutorial or two just to get by.[/quote]</p>
<p>Tbh, did you read the title?</p>
