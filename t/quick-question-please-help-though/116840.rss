    <title>Quick question... please help though</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quick-question-please-help-though/116840</link>
    <description>Hi, im coding my server now, im about 85% done.  There is one problem, I cant get attack to work.  I have made a new training area, and I want the Zamorak statue to train attack, but for some reason it wont give the EXP.  This shouldn&#39;t be happening because I made the Guthix statue train strength and it works perfectly!  Can someone explain why it wont train attack?  

BTW if you help me it will make my server 95% percent done, because iv&#39;e been trying to figure out for a week already what to do, iv&#39;e messed me server up 4 times but lukally I had a backup copy :P.  So if anyone could help this would be greatly appritiated!</description>
