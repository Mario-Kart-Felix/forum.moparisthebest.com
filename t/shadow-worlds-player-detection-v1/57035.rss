    <title>Shadow Worlds Player Detection v1</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shadow-worlds-player-detection-v1/57035</link>
    <description>Hey there, I wanted to just post this.. I know anyone doesn&#39;t play this game[[url=http://www.shadow-worlds.net]Shadow Worlds[/url]] or anything, so it is pretty much just for looks.

This is my first actual SCRIPT(I am not counting scripts that were for testing with Tutorials/Guides) that is working with forms, so I hope anyone doesn&#39;t judge it (even though, I am sure some will :D).

In the game there isn&#39;t anykind of antimacros, but there people check you up and report to moderators, so that&#39;s where this script comes useful. It will alarm and that way let you know, if someone came into the (walking) screen.. ..it detects other players by name color. My current goal is to make a script which would autorespond, but still a long, looong way for it. :P

Well, anyways, here it is... :|

(comes with the script, couple older versions of it (with which I started) and an alarm + error sound (which are needed in script..) so that&#39;s why it is in .zip)</description>
