    <title>Custom Crowns - Pink Background [HELP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-crowns-pink-background-help/542288</link>
    <description>Hey. I added custom crows to my client. And some people are saying RGB 255,0,255 = pink. And other are saying not to use that. What background colour am I going to use then?

I tried with RGB = 255, 0 , 255. But I still got pink background. Isn&#39;t my client supporting transparency or what?</description>
