    <description>Hello everyone, so im working on a website for my server. I&#39;m using RCS v1.5 as my base. I&#39;m trying to add highscores, i&#39;ve set it up server side, i just need it to work on site. If someone has the time to skype or TV me, i&#39;d greatly appreciate it. 

The problems im running into, i downloaded a Highscores php from another site (dont know what advertising rules are)

and then read a few guides, but im still a little confused, i can&#39;t ask a guide a question  So i ahve the PHP&#39;s and what not for highscores, just trying to get it set up and get my index.php (which controls my tabs on site) to send the correct php file and what not. Im basically winging this, its turning out somewhat decent lol

<p>EDIT: Or he was supposed to be, RCS is a great resource for anyone to use. Wix isn’t a bad start for anyone needing a basic website, it’s actually a very good resource just not when you’re young and your brain’s a sponge and you could learn the basics of uploading and setting up a website in less than a day.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Ruby, post:3, topic:548286”]Your question is worded horribly but I’m guessing its something to do with the error on your website? If so, try what I’ve said below.</p>
<p>I’ve not looked at any code in ages but I’d say your best bet is you’ve got the host wrong in the config file for database connections. Just by reading the error it says that it can’t create a database connection and there’s a host error so you do the math.</p>
<p>I might be missing something, like I said, not touched PHP (or any code for that matter) in a long time so there might be something else but that would be the logical problem following the error log.[/quote]</p>
<p>The error shown is because i edited the config.php, and now its not wanting to connect, which isn’t good for me. because i don’t understand what I did wrong?</p>
<p>In config.php it says</p>
<p><code>//if you change $data['use_recaptcha'] to true, you must specify a private and public keycode
//^^^^^^^^^^^^</code></p>
<p>so i put</p>
<p><code>$data['use_recaptcha'] = true; //true = use google's recaptcha, false = don't
$data['public_key'] = '6LfM7v4SAAAAABYTWb-PswrdsLvQ-AiLAnpEhwp7'; //public key given to you by google
$data['private_key'] = '6LfM7v4SAAAAAJOxWACbzJLJeq2JE3l8E1rzRu2J'; //private key given to you by google
</code></p>
<p>the only thing that could be wrong is where it wants connection, but if i remember that was blank before</p>
<p><code>//database connection settings
$db_host = '{host}';
$db_user = '{user}';
$db_name = '{name}';
$db_password = '{pass}';</code></p>
<p>[edit= i also did this to defaultconfig.php]<br>
[editx2= i tried even putting origonal config.php and defaultconfig.php back and still same error… WDF?!]</p>
