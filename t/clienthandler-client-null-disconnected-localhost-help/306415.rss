    <title>ClientHandler: Client null disconnected (localhost) - Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clienthandler-client-null-disconnected-localhost-help/306415</link>
    <description>Wow... It&#39;s been a while since I posted a topic in here.. I feel pretty dumb right now.

Alright, *sigh*

What the hell does this even mean? I&#39;m not understanding why this is spamming my runserver window so much. This is a DeltaScape source and all of the anti-leeches have already been removed. I can log in fine and everything and log off fine, but my runserver window won&#39;t shut the fuck up. I could just turn it on and not attempt to log in and it would constantly say this, and it wasn&#39;t saying this earlier today. It just now started:

[code]Connection from localhost:1471

Connection from localhost:1534[/code]

And it goes on and on and on... I&#39;ve searched for that text in my client class and I found this:

[code]	public void destruct() {
		/*if (!logoutButton)
		{
			if (!destruct)
				destruct = true;
			if (destruct &amp;&amp; !waited)
				return;
		}*/
		if (mySock == null) {
			return;
		} // already shutdown
		try {
			//server.controlPanel.removeListModelItem(playerName);
			misc.println(&quot;ClientHandler: Client &quot; + playerName
					+ &quot; disconnected (&quot; + connectedFrom + &quot;)&quot;);
			disconnected = true;
			if (saveNeeded)
				savegame(true);
			if (in != null) {
				in.close();
			}
			if (out != null) {
				out.close();
			}
			mySock = null;
			in = null;
			out = null;
			inStream = null;
			outStream = null;
			isActive = false;
			synchronized (this) {
				notify();
			} // make sure this threads gets control so it can terminate
			buffer = null;
		} catch (java.io.IOException ioe) {
			ioe.printStackTrace();
		}
		super.destruct();
	}[/code]

Please help me fix this so I can proceed with my life. Thanks.</description>

<p>Alright, <em>sigh</em></p>
<p>What the hell does this even mean? I’m not understanding why this is spamming my runserver window so much. This is a DeltaScape source and all of the anti-leeches have already been removed. I can log in fine and everything and log off fine, but my runserver window won’t shut the fuck up. I could just turn it on and not attempt to log in and it would constantly say this, and it wasn’t saying this earlier today. It just now started:</p>

		try {
			//server.controlPanel.removeListModelItem(playerName);
			misc.println("ClientHandler: Client " + playerName
					+ " disconnected (" + connectedFrom + ")");
			disconnected = true;
			if (saveNeeded)
				savegame(true);

			inStream = null;

			synchronized (this) {

			} // make sure this threads gets control so it can terminate
			buffer = null;
		} catch (java.io.IOException ioe) {

<p>Please help me fix this so I can proceed with my life. Thanks.</p>
