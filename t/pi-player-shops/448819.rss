    <title>[PI]Player shops?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-player-shops/448819</link>
    <description>ok so i have added working player shops and they work pretty good, i just cant figure out why everything is valued at 1gp ?  so if someone could give me an idea how to edit the item prices within the player shops, or even make it so the seller can select how much they wish to sell the item in their shops for... Help would be appreciated... (if you dont know dont comment i CBF with trollers etc.)   

thanks
