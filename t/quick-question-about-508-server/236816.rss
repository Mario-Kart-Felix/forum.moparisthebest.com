    <description>i got my server to work and  all. i got the client too :o

but im wondering how do i let other people on my server?

i already port forwarded and ect.. like i can get people on my 317 server, but when i searched &quot;server, for the server ip in the client to change it to mine it came up with nothing?? so what do i do,

or is there special client that i need to use???
