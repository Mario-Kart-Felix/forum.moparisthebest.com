    <description>Ok this might sound a little stupid, but what do i send people that want to play the server? The only way i know is to send them ALL the files. Which pretty much gives them owner power.

Please don&#39;t troll. I&#39;m new to this.</description>

              <p>Only “you” needs the source files. The client manages all the animations, models, and interfaces which are packed into the cahce. The source files are what the host has that lets him modify the server. The server is what contains all the code for woodcutting, trading, ect. After you change the ip you just give people that client that will now connect to your server. If your worried about people taking the client just delete all the java files so only class files are left. Which will make it more difficult to get the code.</p>
