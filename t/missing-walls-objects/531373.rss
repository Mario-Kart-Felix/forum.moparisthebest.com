    <description>Really wasn&#39;t sure where I should post this at, but I came to the conclusion that this was the most logical section. If not, a moderator can feel free to move it. :)
Alright, so let me just start by saying I know nothing about clients. Especially not terminology, such as: refactored, renamed, obfuscated, and so on..I have looked them up, but can&#39;t really find great explanations and Wikipedia is a hard thing for me to rely on. Anyways, getting to the point. I want to know what I need to fix/add in the client to fix things such as missing objects/walls, like so:

Information about my client?
Not sure if I can link so won&#39;t, but if you want to know; it is the &#39;Divine-Fate&#39; client released on R-S.
It is 317 *I [b][u]think[/u][/b], it is loading [code]508/525 Maps Loaded: 1226
508/525 Objects Loaded: 38424[/code]* because that is what it says in the console when you start it up.
Although, it could be wrong, like I said I know nothing. :)
Any help is appreciated, thank you.
Also, I do want to learn so any links to explanations of those terms above or other commonly used terms are welcomed.  ;)</description>
