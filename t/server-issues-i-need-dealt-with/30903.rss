    <description>Problems on my server if any1 can help me with...

1. Magic on Players does not work.

2. How do i put a cap on my total level so it only changes as players gain stats and not  when    they gain levels and loose or gain hp?

3. How do i put a cap on my hp so Guthans Special does not make it go over the limit?

4. Players stats randomly lower at times, how do i fix?

5. Beards work but not when i put on frem helms, or med helms, how do i fix?

Ok, so if ANYBODY can help me fix these problems id greatly appreciate that, thanks.</description>
