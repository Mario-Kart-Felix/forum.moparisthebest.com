    <description>
[ul][list][list]Hello, and welcome to the official Oraculum Development thread. Here you can keep track of all current updates I have made to Oraculum, and track the progress of the source that will hopefully unify the MoparScape Community.

[size=18pt]Key Features[/size]
[list]
[li][b]NO[/b] customs. Period. most people add customs because they think that it will be a nice addition, but really it just makes the server look sloppy because no content was developed with the customs.[/li]
[li]Hyperion is the base. now I know I&#39;ll probably be flamed because of this, but Hyperion was really effective, but there can still be some improvements. Like making sure that not EVERYTHING is it&#39;s own object, when it can easily be substituted for an int for example.[/li]
[li]Everything will be stored in a Database. Note that this might not be as fast as a local file, but it is more efficient. And I personally value efficiency over speed.[/li]
[/list]

[size=18pt]Planned Developments[/size]

This is where I will keep the features I intend to add to the server.
[list]
[li]Personal Shops. In lieu of a Grand Exchange that is almost always programmed improperly and ineffectively, I will be giving players a secondary storage container that they can either store items in for more transport(Like a Yak in Summoning), but they will also have the option of setting a price for the items in this container, and other Players can view their shop and purchase the items that way.[/li]
[li]Full Skills. Not just dinky half-assed cutting bows and arrows. I&#39;m talking about 100% content. Every frame correct, every option used, every piece of this server programmed to it&#39;s fullest potential.[/li]
[li]All Minigames. Yes [b]EVERY[/b] Minigame. Ranging from Castlewars and Barrows, to Runeversi and Runedoku(The sudoku spinoff used with Ali Morisanne for (generally) cheaper runes).[/li]
[li]All Original Quests. Yes, this will take an extensive amount of time, and require me to complete each quest in RuneScape to get all the fine details, but it will be worth it to the players[/li]
[li]And much, much more.[/li]
[/list]

[size=18pt]Bugs[/size]
[list]
[li]Items classified as full helms show the beard, where hats don&#39;t. Status: Completed[/li][/list]

[size=18pt]Updates[/size]
[list]
[li]April 10th: Removed the ugly configuration loading created by Graham, and replaced it with a clean loading from a DB.[/li]
[li]April 14th: Decided to roll a 474. Make something worthwhile.[/li]
[/list]
[size=18pt]Media[/size]
I haven&#39;t taken any pictures yet, but I will be soon.

So check back here often to stay up-to-date on Oraculum. Thank you for reading.[/list][/list][/ul]</description>

That has nothing to do with what I’m talking about.<br>
Your server has to take into account there are different items, etc.</p>

              <p>[ul][list][list]Hello, and welcome to the official Oraculum Development thread. Here you can keep track of all current updates I have made to Oraculum, and track the progress of the source that will hopefully unify the MoparScape Community.</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Key Features[/size]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">NO</span> customs. Period. most people add customs because they think that it will be a nice addition, but really it just makes the server look sloppy because no content was developed with the customs.[/li]<br>
[li]Hyperion is the base. now I know I’ll probably be flamed because of this, but Hyperion was really effective, but there can still be some improvements. Like making sure that not EVERYTHING is it’s own object, when it can easily be substituted for an int for example.[/li]<br>
[li]Everything will be stored in a Database. Note that this might not be as fast as a local file, but it is more efficient. And I personally value efficiency over speed.[/li]<br>
[/list]</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Planned Developments[/size]</p>
<p>This is where I will keep the features I intend to add to the server.<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Personal Shops. In lieu of a Grand Exchange that is almost always programmed improperly and ineffectively, I will be giving players a secondary storage container that they can either store items in for more transport(Like a Yak in Summoning), but they will also have the option of setting a price for the items in this container, and other Players can view their shop and purchase the items that way.[/li]<br>
[li]Full Skills. Not just dinky half-assed cutting bows and arrows. I’m talking about 100% content. Every frame correct, every option used, every piece of this server programmed to it’s fullest potential.[/li]<br>
[li]All Minigames. Yes <span class="bbcode-b">EVERY</span> Minigame. Ranging from Castlewars and Barrows, to Runeversi and Runedoku(The sudoku spinoff used with Ali Morisanne for (generally) cheaper runes).[/li]<br>
[li]All Original Quests. Yes, this will take an extensive amount of time, and require me to complete each quest in RuneScape to get all the fine details, but it will be worth it to the players[/li]<br>
[li]And much, much more.[/li]<br>
[/list]</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Bugs[/size]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Items classified as full helms show the beard, where hats don’t. Status: Completed[/li][/list]</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Updates[/size]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]April 10th: Removed the ugly configuration loading created by Graham, and replaced it with a clean loading from a DB.[/li]<br>
[li]April 14th: Decided to roll a 474. Make something worthwhile.[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[size=18pt]Media[/size]<br>
I haven’t taken any pictures yet, but I will be soon.</p>
<p>So check back here often to stay up-to-date on Oraculum. Thank you for reading.[/list][/list][/ul]</p>
