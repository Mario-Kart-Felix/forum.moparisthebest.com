    <title>[BS]Allowing others to connect[BS]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bs-allowing-others-to-connect-bs/413704</link>
    <description>Okay so right now this is my second day on trying to figure out how to run the server. So far I&#39;ve got some of the parts but one which I tried so many times is letting others connect to my server. 

Since I&#39;m using battlescape source it&#39;s kind of confusing. This is the client I was using when I downloaded the source with it.

[url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9098208/Client.zip]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9098208/Client.zip[/url]

Anyone could please help me? I want to let my friends come on and just mess around. 

Do I have to edit anything in the client folder or the server folder? I tried to edit the client.java in the client folder, looked for [code]//public String server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;[/code] And changed it to my no-ip.

Saved it and compiled it. And compressed it into a .rar file and uploaded it to a file uploader site, and went on a diff computer, downloaded the file. Hit the run.bat and I got an error. 

[email]phantom981@hotmail.com[/email] is my msn username. If anyone would like to help me that&#39;d be much appreciated and I will rep you.

Thankyou very much.</description>

Second off, What base? It could be in your gui class depending on the base.</p>
