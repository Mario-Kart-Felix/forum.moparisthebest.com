    <title>317 &amp; 508... some clarification please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-508-some-clarification-please/319331</link>
    <description>I have been off the scene on mopar for at least a year, and was programming back in the days of testscape and Pimpscape etc.

can someone please get me up to date on the differences between 508/317 etc and which is more suited to what?

They both are stable but its just how its coded</p>

<p>go on a server that is 508 or 525 and tell me how many times it dcs in 5min. seriously, they are really unstable.[/quote]LOL! You my friend are stuck in the past. 508s are way more stable than most 317 servers simply because they’re not stuffed with useless shit.</p>

              <p>Ok everyone the truth is<br>
For a server to be stable it matters how its coded<br>
And the guy who said RS2HD is the most stable 508 server<br>
Your right because he uses conventions and he coded the whole thing properly<br>
and the new palidino servers are using stuff from RS2HD because Graham released a<br>
WORKING EventManager which is really useful</p>

<p>NO IT WOULDN’T. LMFAO.</p>
<p>ALL 508S AND 525S ARE UNSTABLE. obviously, you have never ever ever played a 500+ server.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve hosted one.<br>
It was Palidino’s base. It was pretty horrible, to be honest.</p>
<p>But if I used RS2HD and not Palidino’s base it would be alot better.<br>
Servers like JC-Scape and others have had 300 on at one time with no lag or dcs thanks to RS2HD.</p>
<p>The fact that you think 508s+ are unstable is because many people use Palidino’s base.<br>
If everyone used RS2HD, you would not be saying anything, because RS2HD is stable as fuck. People just don’t use it for their 508s or 525s. If they did, then no 317 servers “stability” could compare to them.</p>

<p>Let me repeat, RS2HD, a server released by Graham, is very stable. There is RS2HD for both 508s and 525s. More people use Palidinos base although, and his base is not as stable.</p>
<p>Before replying to another one of my posts, take a look at RS2HD:</p>

              <p>508 is the more newer version of RS (Updated graphics, npcs, emotes, interfaces etc…)</p>
<p>317 is what it’s always been, the old version of rs. Except now people have found out how to dump emotes and gfxs and even maps from the newer versions of RS and make them formatible to 317s. I don’t see the point in this because you can just use 508s and don’t have to go through all the trouble of adding all the stuff into the 317 client.</p>
<p>508 servers are packaged, 317s are not. For some reason, all these noobs don’t use 508s because of the packaging.</p>
<p>Basically, just use 508s if you like newer versions of rs, and use 317 if you like the old look, but if you want to add new emotes etc… you will have to go through the hassle of that.</p>
