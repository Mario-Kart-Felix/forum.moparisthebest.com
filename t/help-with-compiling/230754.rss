    <title>Help with compiling?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-compiling/230754</link>
    <description>This is probably one of the dumbest questions ever, but...

I&#39;ve recently reinstalled windows because my comp had too much space taken up.
So, I&#39;ve downloaded the source and client I was using for my server and I can succesfully run it. But if I try to compile it says
&#39;the system cannot find the path specified&#39;. If i remember correctly, I have to make my computer recognize the coding or something,
but I don&#39;t remember how. Can anybody help?</description>
