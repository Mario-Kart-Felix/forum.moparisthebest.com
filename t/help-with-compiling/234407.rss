    <title>Help with compiling</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-compiling/234407</link>
    <description>i recently started learning the use of c++ and java.  Although i may not be extensive in these languages, i have the determination to do so.  In my recent coding projects, i discovered moparscape on google.  To my dismay, it was simplae at first.  Then i began looking up details on compiling at the java site..i set some environmental variables although i am not sure they are correct or not.  I began to make a compiler.  I am pretty sure it works, but i could be wrong.  Anyways the coding i used for my compiler is this:

[code]@echo off
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin\javac.exe&quot; ./files/*.java
pause[/code]

I believe it works becuz i tested it...it seems like it would work, but i think something is wrong.

Everytime i use it when compiling my runescape files i come across an error which i hate!!!!!!

it says:

Note: some input files are unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: recompile with -xlint:unchecked for details.
Press any key to continue.

1.  After seeing this message i keep thinking to my self and i wonder if maybe i put the compiler in the wrong place
2.  Maybe i wrote the code wrong...
3.  Did i do the environment variables right?

I searched gogle frantically but nothing seemed to help, so i have officially decided to post at the mother of all project sites(in which has me hooked :D)  asking this simple question.

What is wrong?

should the compiler say echo on and at the bottom echo off instead of pause?

i just want some straight answers, im accepting all answers as i will try them all, please dont post that i am a noob, or that im &quot;leeching&quot;  as people seem to do here alot i have noticed...im here to learn, not fight</description>

<p>If my compiler isnt an error, then can u direct me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Could it be my environment variables?  Sumthing wrong with the classpath and path variables?</p>
<p>Maybe it could be that i put the compiler in the wrong spot?  i think its in the right spot…i think</p>
