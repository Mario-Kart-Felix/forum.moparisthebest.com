    <description>LOL, nope. Although; noticing that Mod Tharok actually became a Mod makes me a little weary of what&#39;s been going on since i&#39;ve been away.

I hope everyone&#39;s Ok, still up for Japan?

And [b]IF[/b] you don&#39;t remember me, don&#39;t post, kai?

Great to be back ^___^</description>

The fact that you came alot later after everyone else; and sucked some e-dick to get premoted, yes, yes i do. And lots of people left because of you, like Sam, and Error.<br>

<p>Alot of people had stuff about you. Your one of the main reasons why i dont go on mopar anymore Because you do stuff without asking other mods first… And trying to suck up to everyone trying to get gmod. I Really do hope that you NEVER get gmod. Really do.</p>

              <p>@ Taharok</p>
<p>Im refering to your skills overall.</p>
<p>Just the fact that i was developing private servers since the start?</p>
<p>I was there when winterlove released the 1st source.<br>
No characters, No movement, Offline and random items each square.</p>
<p>I was there coding right at the start. There were 3 main open sources. Blakescape, e-scape and nixscape.</p>
<p>Soon after Whitefang joined with the creator of e-scape and did some major developement.<br>
This was the era of runestatus. Perhaps the best time for private server coding as there was a great community with lots of active members all assisting each other. Whitefang kind of lost intrest around here and his source was released. Also around that time projectiles were finally released. (by phate and some one else.)</p>
<p>But the good era came to an end. runestatus shut down and activity dropped.  Soon runestatus was reborn under the new identity “avatorium” and further developement was made. There was perhaps the largest scale project ever here. Intergrating the server seemlessly with forums.</p>
<p>Then avatorium went down again and i lost interst in developing for them.</p>
<p>There is still my public source floating around the place. Perhaps the easiest source to customize as most things can be changed through a text file so no skill was required to produce your own server. My private one had most features servers have today but built on WinterLoves second source release. Where as all the MS community does is slightly modify  testscape and p16 sources.</p>
<p>Also dont judge people on forum posts.<br>
Most of the progress in PS developement was done through IM, mainly irc though sometimes msn. (I know whitefang prefered MSN.)</p>
<p>Hmmm so do i know what i am speaking of?</p>
<p>I was in right from the start helping with developement. I spent hours a day helping people. I posted alot on kaitnieks, runestatus and rune-severz.</p>
<p>Unless you really know who you are posting about, dont post about them.</p>

So sorry about spamming in your thread &gt;.&lt;</p>
