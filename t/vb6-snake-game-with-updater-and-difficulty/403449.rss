Not a bad game to start out with. However, I don’t agree with VB6 (If that makes any sense), I feel like Visual Basic is in some sense making people believe they are legit programmers when VB6 is just making things a whole lot easier then they really are, not saying that’s a bad thing. You should learn how to do it from scratch FIRST, and not take for granted what VB does.</p>
<p>You can continue with VB, however I do recommend that you move on to more advanced, high-level languages.</p>
<p>PS: Put up a scan picture, .exe files cannot be trusted.<br>
[/quote]<br>
well if you think about it java is an easier alternative to C and C/++ is an alternative to using an even lower level language - like assembly.  so if you think about it even more, java and C/++ shouldn’t be used because it’s just making programming easier.[/quote]</p>
<p>True, it’s just an opinion I’ve developed about VB6 though. It’s a smart idea I think for someone to learn how something works (obviously that may be tedious and annoying work), but depending on the result from that, when you do move on to things that make it a whole lot easier to do said-task, you at least have the background knowledge of how that task came to be.</p>

Not a bad game to start out with. However, I don’t agree with VB6 (If that makes any sense), I feel like Visual Basic is in some sense making people believe they are legit programmers when VB6 is just making things a whole lot easier then they really are, not saying that’s a bad thing. You should learn how to do it from scratch FIRST, and not take for granted what VB does.</p>
<p>You can continue with VB, however I do recommend that you move on to more advanced, high-level languages.</p>
<p>PS: Put up a scan picture, .exe files cannot be trusted.<br>

<p>I tried c++, and made my first Warrock hack, but i dont think im going to make other programs in that one, i like vb6 :D, and ill add scan picture give me a min :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Whatever floats your boat, that’s fine, hell for all I know I could be talking to a person who will revolutionize VB6 and the programs that come out of it.</p>
