    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-your-first-runescape-private-server-no-hamachi/377676</link>
    <description>Hello Moparscape! I have been trying to portforward with everyone elses guides but none work. So, i tried myself by putting all the videos together and.. It worked! And I just thought I might post this just incase people still cant figure it out.

Today I will be using my Netgear router. And I will keep it nice and simple :)

Ok so... Lets get on with this!

First, you will need to register for NO-IP. Do this by going to no-ip.com and clicking create account
[img]http://C:\Users\user\Pictures\no-ip reg button.jpg[/img]
Ok, after that you must register on that page!
[img]http://C:\Users\user\Pictures\no-ip reg page.jpg[/img]
Right, now that you&#39;ve done that it&#39;s time to make a host! Click on Hosts/Redirects, then click on add a host, now that you are there put in your Server name and choose your domain. Then click on create host.
[img]http://C:\Users\user\Pictures\no-ip add host.jpg[/img]
Okeyyy, now you must download no-ip! Choose your operating system and download!
[img]http://C:\Users\user\Pictures\no-ip download.jpg[/img]
When downloaded and installed open no-ip duc and login. When you&#39;ve logged in click on select hosts. Select your host and click ok or whatever it sayzz..
[img]http://C:\Users\user\Pictures\no-ip duc.jpg[/img]

UTORRENT

Okeyy, I used uTorrent aswell, idk if it&#39;s needed but I will tell you. 
So, download uTorrent, don&#39;t open it yet. Now, in this order open up No-ip, your server and then uTorrent!
When you got utorrent up, go to options&gt;Preferences&gt;Connection. Okay, seee the port thing? Change it to 43594. After that tick all the boxes except from &quot;Randomize port each start&quot; Now click OK!! Congratz you just set up uTorrent!

COMMAND PROMPT

Now, open start menu, search cmd, when you&#39;ve opened up that type ipconfig/all
Then look for I pv4 Address. It will have a ip like 192.168.1.(SOMETHING) Now minimize cmd because we will need in about 1minute!
[img]http://C:\Users\user\Pictures\cmd opconfig.jpg[/img]

MAKING THE PORT!!

Okeyyy, now, go to Control Panel&gt;Allow a program through windows firewall (UNDER SECURITY) When opened click on add port, call the name anything you want but make sure the port is 43594. Now click OK&gt;OK But keep Control panel open! 

ERMM, IDK REALLY WHAT TO CALL THIS PART LOL

Ok, now still in control panel navigate to network and internet&gt;network and sharing centre then on the left hand side click on Manage network connections. Now right click on your network&gt;properties. Now i will explain this aswell as I can! Right, when in properties click on Internet protocol version 4 then properties. When there dot &quot;use the following IP address&quot; now for the ip address put 192.168.1.(ANY NUMBER HERE BETWEEN 1and100! AND ALSO REMEMBER THAT NUMBER!!) So yeah do that, now for subnet mask open up cmd and look for subnet mask (near I pv4 address) Type that in, now for the default gate way put 192.168.1.1, when done that, go underneath and see DNS Servers? Yeah type in 192.168.1.1. now click on ok&gt;ok and now you can close all of that! 

PORTFORWARDING! Shocking eh?

type in your internet browser 192.168.1.1, a box will come up, type in admin, admin or it might be admin, password like mine :) yep so when your on that site click on port forwarding/port triggering then click on add custom service, fill all that in! for the 2 ports put 43594. for IP address put 192.168.1.(the number you entered earlier!) ok now you&#39;re done! Please tell me if i have forgotten anything!!</description>
