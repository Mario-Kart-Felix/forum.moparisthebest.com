    <title>What routers work good with p servers... and which dont work at all with them</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-routers-work-good-with-p-servers-and-which-dont-work-at-all-with-them/125214</link>
    <description>Im planning on getting a router because Im sick of not being on the server status list and Im sick of nobody knowing my server exists.  So far its hamachi... which is *made very clear to the public* to be B-A-D.  Well anyway I dont want to go buy one and end up with the wrong thing or a bad one that wont work for shit.  Please post some following information for me...

How much is one...?
What ones are good...?
What ones dont work for p servers...? (if any dont)
What router do you use...?   (if you have 1)

And possibly any information you think i&#39;d need to make a good purchase.

I know very little about routers, mostly because I overlooked most information about them over time (since I didnt care because I didnt have one anyway).  I pretty much only know [i](think)[/i] that they let other computers connect to yours...but thats about it. 

Please post so I dont waste a bunch of money and end up with something that doesnt work.</description>

              <p>You don’t need to buy a router if you don’t have 2 computers. You can set up a no-ip at <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> if you don’t have a router you will not need to port forward. If you only have one computer you should have no problem letting people play your server.</p>
