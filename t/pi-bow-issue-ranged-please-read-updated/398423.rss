    <title>PI [bow issue] ranged - please read updated!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-bow-issue-ranged-please-read-updated/398423</link>
    <description>this has to do with attacking npcs, when i am owner it is fine but when i am any other playerrights they run towards the monster and go melee range, i checked public int bows to make sure the bow was in there and it is. 

i cant find where this has been changed i tried putting  it source to source that has ranged working and cant find where they added this in to make it go melee range. 


thanks for any help 


edit: big edit!!!

i just found out it works for everyone btu first i need to fire a crossbow than regular shortbows work and throwingg items.... any fix for this? so it dont matter if i fire crossbow first or now

the item must be rune c&#39;bow for it to work regular</description>
