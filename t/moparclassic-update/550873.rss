    <title>MoparClassic Update</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparclassic-update/550873</link>
    <description>To whoever is interested,

I would like to &quot;update&quot; Moparclassic to become the next EasyRSC. It is one of the initial goals of the project to create a platform for the future. The updated version will be strictly Java8+ which means we will not be using scala or another language for scripting.

[b]Server UI[/b]
Unlike EasyRSC, we will not be using a UI when starting a server but maybe we can use one to allow people to choose their content? The ScriptManager I wrote is a UI which allows for scripts to be activated/deactivated.

 
[b]Server Core[/b]
The server core will be Elysium : https://github.com/Lothy/Elysium

[b]Server Scripting[/b]
The server content will be completely scripted and each script will be its own Jar File. Scripts will be downloaded by future hosters either from the MoparScape website or our own website, maybe even github? Each piece of content will have its own file, for example Flax, Bowstring etcetcetcetc. It might seem excessive but is appropriate as we have seen plenty of different kinds of servers.

[b]Server Client[/b]
TBD


Possible additions that need to be discussed:
RSCDEF area unpacker/packer. If an area was not being used, the data for that area would not be loaded until it was activated and then removed out of the memory after a set amount of time without players. P2P places that lack player traffic would benefit from this.

Anti-Botting technology? It would come down to server owners using their own clients. I think we should just focus on offering a core technology.

Database. Should we allow users to choose their DB implementation or should we have a set standard?</description>
