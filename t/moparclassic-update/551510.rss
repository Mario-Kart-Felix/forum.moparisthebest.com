    <title>MoparClassic Update</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparclassic-update/551510</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;I got in contact with a few people about this idea and while it seems like its not worth the time and effort, slow progression will be made at making a new platform for the future. All source code will be on github.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


To whoever is interested,

I would like to &quot;update&quot; Moparclassic to become the next EasyRSC. It is one of the initial goals of the project to create a platform for the future. The updated version will be strictly Java8+ which means we will not be using scala or another language for scripting.

[b]Server UI[/b]
Unlike EasyRSC, we will not be using a UI when starting a server but maybe we can use one to allow people to choose their content? The ScriptManager I wrote is a UI which allows for scripts to be activated/deactivated.

 
[b]Server Core[/b]
The server core will be Elysium : https://github.com/Lothy/elysium-single-threaded 

[b]Server Scripting[/b]
The server content will be completely scripted and each script will be its own Jar File. Scripts will be downloaded by future hosters either from the MoparScape website or our own website, maybe even github? Each piece of content will have its own file, for example Flax, Bowstring etcetcetcetc. It might seem excessive but is appropriate as we have seen plenty of different kinds of servers.

[b]Server Client[/b]
TBD


Possible additions that need to be discussed:
RSCDEF area unpacker/packer. If an area was not being used, the data for that area would not be loaded until it was activated and then removed out of the memory after a set amount of time without players. P2P places that lack player traffic would benefit from this.

Anti-Botting technology? It would come down to server owners using their own clients. I think we should just focus on offering a core technology.

Database. Should we allow users to choose their DB implementation or should we have a set standard?

Website/Registration system, we should probably port a simple secure platform that server owners can build on.</description>

              <p>I don’t think i ever really contributed to MoparClassic, but i did want to. It highly put me off when people started changing it, adding scala and all of a sudden anyone who doesnt know scala will be put off from it. I didn’t look too much at MoparClassic source, but i did read that people kept breaking shit and changing shit and now its a mess.</p>
<p>I only recently have had the change to go through all this RSC stuff, but i can say in my own opinion the last good place a server was at, was probably Peter’s 2nd Darkquest (the RSCA fork that basically converted a lot of content into java plugins). That was a good point. I know that when i was apart of ProjectRSC one of the devs then added python scripts into the mix and the same thing really, scripting was only efficient to someone who knew python.</p>
<p>In my own opinion, a good server to start collaborating on would be to take something like an early version of ProjectRSC (after the netty implementation, but before the F2P &amp; python changes) and work off that.</p>
<p>Another huge part of active development is accessibility. If people can download a server and it works out of the box that’s great. Being tied to SQL is fine, i think though by default it should be disabled and SQLite should be used instead. Maybe even bundled with a program where you can create accounts.</p>
<p>I think years ago when i forked mopar classic i went to compile/run it and it didn’t have a compile/launch script, or it didn’t have the right library, or the paths were hardcoded to someones computer. fix that and it was a compile error, or an incompatible java error, then you gotta set up sql, import db and overall it was a good hour or 2 of fucking around that people simply don’t want to do.</p>
<p>it could certainly use a bit of easyrsc treatment, without degrading any quality or adding a GUI. if i knew i could click the download button on moparclassic, launch a few files and it all just worked, i’d be keen to develop.</p>

<p>Sorry but you have already contributed to the community (MoparClassic) as you host a server do you not? You have taken RSCD like the rest of us and continued its advancement. While your player count has never been phenomenal you still provide an outlet for players of this scene. Thank you in your contributions <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The overall goal for this project was to have a source available to anyone who is interested in RSC and that way we can ensure a future as servers are continuously hosted throughout the years to come. While not all aspects of the source are perfect, this project and others are just another stepping stone to advancement. Your server and your contributions are yours to choose if you want to release. It’s your right to choose if you want to contribute (if you don’t ever contribute that is perfectly fine!). Maybe a player on your server will someday show an interest in development and make something that the players of the community to enjoy.</p>

 The people in this list were the ones that were supposed to make this project happen, If the server was up for longer than two weeks I guarantee it would have gotten support. But you shut it down before anything could happen claiming the 'source is too broken' instead of bothering to fix the simplest bugs. [b]The community has nothing to do with this project being a failure, it is strictly the 'head of operations' who made it fail[/b]. You basically showed the community that it's simply not worth putting any time into it as it would go to waste.
<p>[quote=“gawdz666, post:27, topic:551510”]Look you are talking about progress on a game ~15 years old. Let them all quit our day jobs to keep up to your “schedule of progress”.</p>
<p>Let them manage and do whatever they want this is a community project dude. That means if the community doesn’t do shit then the project doesn’t do shit.[/quote]<br>
You obviously don’t need to quit your daily jobs to manage such simple game as RSC. The leadership is very important in community projects, if the leadership is shit then the project is shit, and nobody wants to contribute to a shitty project. <span class="bbcode-b">Stop blaming the community.</span></p>

<p>I am not they project ‘leader’. I didn’t create this project. I still care for overall goal that it was built on, is that bad?</p>

              <p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:16, topic:551510”]What people fail to realize is that it already has happened. MoparClassic is an aspiration for active development. While the community seems ‘dead’ and ‘inactive’, <span class="bbcode-b">WE still have servers actively running</span> (RSCE, RSCR, Karamja, ClassicKBD, insert server here) and that is all based on what the community (over the last almost 10 years) has done. Individualism does not exist and it is all a common goal.</p>
<p>Viewing the communities history thread and pre moparscape forums you can draw a tree of what people have done and how we have slowly progressed and how it turned into the RSCDv25 era with Reines producing some top notch shit back in the day. All servers hosted today are influenced from RSCD. The term “MoparClassic” doesn’t mean an individual server for everybody to play but the community that you seem to have an active forum account on.</p>
<p>Nobody can make a claim to runescape classic (even Andrew himself) because he used a wheel someone else made. (Binary, Machine Code, OS, file formats, JVM etc etc) If you wrote everyone on a list who helped RSC exist then you would probably have over a million people. One of the last conversations I had with Kryptix was about the release of RSCE. Hell, he even posted the thought about it on these forums because he himself recognized the common goal and love for the game we all share. It’s not about what we can produce today, but where the game will be in 2020 or 2025.</p>
<p>Last note, some of the small 2 week servers over the years were the best servers ever and that was because we allowed for rsc to be accessible to someone who didnt know two cents about the jvm. KCCO[/quote]</p>
<p>Probably the best said thing about RSC. When i first released RSCE with Kryptix it was a goal to keep rsc alive wasnt about money etc back then. Most people who play RSC just reminds them about their childhood and honestly even though it has really shitty graphics because its almost 15 year old game now we all got nostalgia for this game.</p>
<p>I hope progress either picks up or more people start contributing.</p>
<p>That or find Stork tell him to do something.</p>
