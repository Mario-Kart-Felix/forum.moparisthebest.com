    <title>Webhost company discussion</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webhost-company-discussion/450631</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to know your favorite free webhost, or even paid, and why. No I&#39;m not using this to get a new web host myself. I&#39;m just trying to start up a discussion that just about everyone can join in on.

My favorites would have to be x10hosting for paid and 000webhost for free.I say 000webhost because they offer 100Gbs of bandwidth, about 1.2Gb of hard drive space, and infinite creation of websites. Yes one account can have 10 websites all managed on it. As long as they are all active and being used. They also guarantee a 99% uptime. Even for free hosters.
x10 offers a great package for $10/month (if you pay by the month) for unlimited everything, and they&#39;re support team is amazing at responding with the correct answers.

Your turn</description>
