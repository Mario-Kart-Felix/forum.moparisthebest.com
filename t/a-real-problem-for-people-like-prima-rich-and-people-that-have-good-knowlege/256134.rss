    <description>Ok guys i&#39;m going to have on my server new features that nobody has really thought about, really original. I want to get an idea of what people like.

I know all about what I need to do i&#39;m going to have it to where after a feature happens it sends them a npcdialogue interface in the chat box, with:

Do you like this feature?
           Yes
           No

I know all about what I need to do. After I do the npcdialogue send and the actionbuttons on the interface are 9157 and 9158. 

I would add this:

public int goodFeature = 0;
public int badFeature = 0;

Then I would under the cases add:

case 9158
if (NpcDialogue == 2)
badFeature +== 1;  
removeDialogue();  //Custom thing I added to remove the screen without interfering with interfaces
break;

Would I do this:

badFeature +==1; ?

Or do I have the +== mixed up?</description>
