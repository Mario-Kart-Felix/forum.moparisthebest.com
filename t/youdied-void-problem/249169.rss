    <title>Youdied void problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/youdied-void-problem/249169</link>
    <description>Whenever you log into my server it says &quot;you have defeated *player name*&quot; and it keeps saying that and you die like 50 times ever half a minute. Ive found the youdied; void but, I cant figure out where It&#39;s telling the server to kill the player repeatedly. Ive looked in the places I tought it would be such as &quot;player.java, playerhandler.java, server.java&quot;. I cant figure out were the problem is comming from. Dont tell me the fix. Just tell be where the problem would most likely be. I want to try to figure this out.</description>
