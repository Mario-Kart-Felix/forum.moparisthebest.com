    <description>what are your favorite snack foods? currently, mine are cheddar chex mix, blueberry yogurt, and eggo waffles (blueberry or chocolate chip).

also, i was wondering about a couple things. first of all, if i&#39;ve been outside playing sports or w/e, sometimes i will feel a kind of craving for pasta or bread. is this because my body needs carbohydrates and reacts by telling my brain to want them? do these foods actually taste better when my body needs them, or are the differences on a psychological level? second of all, i love the feeling you get when you haven&#39;t eaten a certain kind of cereal for a long time and you eat it and it tastes real good. that is all.</description>

              <p>Glucose is taken from carbs and burned as energy, excess glucose is turned into fat. iirc energy is most easily gotten from carbs, so you crave it when you need energy.</p>
<p>If you don’t give it the glucose for quick energy, after it is depleted it burns up the rest of the macromolecules, and then it converts the fat into glucose and that is used as energy instead, but your body needs to work harder to do that.</p>
