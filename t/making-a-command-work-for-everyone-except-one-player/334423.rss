<p>Thats an example fo the ipban one if you wanted it for admins and co owners to use then they could use it but nobody would be able to ipban you who is the owner.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("pillzhere")){

<p>NOTE: You may have to take a look over some values like “PlayerName” and “Command” cause these things are <span class="bbcode-b">Case Sensitive</span>!<br>
(Handwritten btw, don’t complain about small mistakes!)</p>
