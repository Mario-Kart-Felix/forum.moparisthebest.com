    <title>Project Pooeybum [Runesource][Completed]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-pooeybum-runesource-completed/438733</link>
    <description>Hello and welcome to Project Pooeybum based off of Runesource.

My aim in this project is to create a source, to be released, which will be easy to use and have fully functioning combat (the bit people are scared of having to write themselves). So far I have had what I consider to be great progress. There are bugs, lots of them. Hopefully not too many in my combat system, but as for the rest of the source I find myself stumbling into one every few minutes. (I do fix them :P)

So to summarise:

What I have done:
Fix quite a few bugs
Add an entity based combat system
Added most of the combat related spells (just gotta get off my ass to add the rest)
Ranging with everything except throwing knives working
Added the interfaces for weapons
Loaded item bonuses via an xml file.
Actually, I loaded quite a lot of additional stuff via xml.
Learnt that people who write good combat systems deserve a pat on the back.

I hate all this business of writing all your goals and then colouring them all red (who cares what you intend to do but haven&#39;t yet done)

Anyway, here is a video to show that I mean business:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f_6njV_I7A


ALSO! If anyone knows the emote for casting slayer darts&#39; id... I will be very happy.

UPDATES:
As of yesterday I added a special attack system and so far have the dragon dagger and the whip working. I used the old whip effect instead of the new one (you either hit nothing or your max hit)
Weapons with the suffix &#39;(p)&#39;, &#39;(p+)&#39; or &#39;(p++)&#39; all now do poison damage at the correct amounts.
Ancient spells have now all been added including area effects and poison effects. The health drain and attack draining effects have not been added yet. End graphics all are at the right heights now (unlike in the video).

As I am releasing this for /YOUR/ use I would really appreciate your input as to what you would like to see. (Obviously leave anything too interesting for you to do yourself :))

I think the entire development may be broken as the source no longer works with any client unless I remove NPC loading and I have no clue as to why.

Note on the above: I got a client to work again but that is the last time I even attempt to compile the client, yet alone try and get prayer head icons. Clients just hate me.


[u][i][b][size=10pt]IN REGARDS TO THE NAME: [/size][/b][/i][/u] This is the internet. What did you actually expect? This place has the maturity of a toddler and a dick to prove it. I think you fellas need to stop judging a book by its cover. It&#39;s not like the name means shit anyway, it is going to be released straight away. I repeat, IT IS NEVER GOING TO BE HOSTED BY ME, WITH THIS NAME.

The first prototype has been released!

Note on the development: As far as I am concerned I have achieved my goal with this. I have released a copy of Runesource that has fully functioning combat and I feel the rest is up to you. I&#39;ll be moving onto developing my own server from this now. :) Goodluck,</description>

<p>Thank you, I will look into it. But to be completely honest I am happy with it as it is. Runescape runs entirely on 600ms as far as I know so I don’t see why I should change it for this.

Goodluck with this. I wouldn’t bother looking at stonefall, all it does is run events/ the server tick off of a scheduled executor service.[/quote]</p>
<p>Runescape runs entirely on a 600ms tick. So I must assume I have done it the right way, unless, you are exclusively referring to the magic hit splats in which case you can change the speed of the gfx and therefore make it match more closely to the hitsplat.</p>

<p>I’m going to keep going until people are happy to use it.

Any suggestions on what I should add?</p>
<p>At the same time I was considering using what I have now as a base for a true role playing server. One that is heavily quest oriented, possibly with an actual story line. I would also be considering a complete overhaul of skills system, maybe introducing some kind of leveling up method to remove some of the grind of traditional Runescape.</p>

<p>add the boring stuff lol,<br>
using your prototype now to get some feeling with runesource but it doesn’t have enough content yet to really build a server on it, for most people including me without experience with runesource.</p>
<p>One thing what bothered me a bit is the hitsplats delay, they only appear like a second after the hit<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s because I wrote everything using the ticks system. I have never written combat before and haven’t played Runescape in years so I was actually just guessing as to how it worked for a lot of it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> As the server runs on a cycle of 600ms I don’t know how I would be able to make anything happen quicker than 600ms.[/quote]<br>
write out the splat the same moment as the hit occurs? without putting a tick for it</p>

<p>That’s because I wrote everything using the ticks system. I have never written combat before and haven’t played Runescape in years so I was actually just guessing as to how it worked for a lot of it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> As the server runs on a cycle of 600ms I don’t know how I would be able to make anything happen quicker than 600ms.</p>
