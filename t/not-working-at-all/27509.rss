    <title>Not working at all</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/not-working-at-all/27509</link>
    <description>Okay, everything is working except nothing is working. Nothing at all. I mean, I can start up moparscape and everything, but when I do, it says it is downloading the cache file just once. I wait for it to finish. Well, 2 minutes after I open it, it just shuts down. That&#39;s it. It shuts down and doesn&#39;t continue. Then when I open it again it restarts the whole download. Once I even got it to 85% or so and it shut down. I have tried the batch file and the jar file, neither of them make any difference. I have no idea what is wrong. Please help.</description>

              <p>I double-click on runMoparScape.bat and it opens up the moparscape window. Then I wait for the cache file to download for the first time running(what it says exactly is "downloading 16mb cache file just this once, please be patient). A few minutes later the window closes and I have to start the download all over again. The same goes for MoparScape.jar. I think I have everything except nothing seems to be working. It’s really weird. My point is I need help with this whole thing.</p>
