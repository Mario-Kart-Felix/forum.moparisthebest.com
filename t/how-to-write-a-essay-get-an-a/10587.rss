    <title>How to write a Essay &amp; get an A!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-write-a-essay-get-an-a/10587</link>
    <description>Okay first of all. The problem with most essays is that the content is disorganized. You may have great ideas and facts that you want to write about, but somewhere during the writing process you start mixing them up. Suddenly your perfect paper sounds all wrong and you want to scream! 

What you need to do is have a good solid outline. Once you have an outline down, your paper writes itself. Your thoughts are organized and the teacher can understand your main point (which is your thesis) and how you supported that thesis. You need to be focused, and that is the key to writing a good essay.

This is a good outline format that they teach in school. I have been following this format and have had 98-100%&#39;s on my essays.

I. Topic / Title 

II. Introduction of Essay
A. Grab the reader&#39;s attention. Then write a few sentences (2 or 3) that lead into the main point of your essay
B. End the paragraph with your thesis statement (3 main points you are going to support)
     1. First point in thesis
     2. Second point in thesis
     3. Third point in thesis

III. Body of Essay
A. First Paragraph - First point in Thesis
     1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence
     2. Have at least five sentences
B. Second Paragraph - Second point in Thesis
     1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence
     2. Have at least five sentences
C. Third Paragraph - Third Point in Thesis
     1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence
     2. Have at least five sentences

IV. Conclusion
A. Write a few sentences summarizing your essay
B. Restate your thesis and how you proved your point

Here are some other pointers.

Don&#39;t have run on sentences. Use commas and semicolons.

Don&#39;t use the same words again and again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some more help.

1.  Miscellaneous observations on a topic are not enough to make an accomplished academic essay. An essay should have an argument. It should answer a question or a few related questions (see 2 below). It should try to  prove something--develop a single &quot;thesis&quot; or a short set of closely related points--by reasoning and evidence, especially including apt examples and confirming citations from any particular text or sources your argument involves. Gathering such evidence normally entails some rereading of the text or sources with a question or provisional thesis in mind.
       
2. When--as is usually the case--an assigned topic does not provide you with a thesis ready-made, your first effort should be to formulate as exactly as possible the question(s) you will seek to answer in your essay. Next, develop by thinking, reading, and jotting a provisional thesis or hypothesis. Don&#39;t become prematurely committed to this first answer. Pursue it, but test it--even to the point of consciously asking yourself what might be said against it--and be ready to revise or qualify it as your work progresses. (Sometimes a suggestive possible title one discovers early can serve in the same way.)
       
3. There are many ways in which any particular argument may be well presented, but an essay&#39;s organization--how it begins, develops, and ends--should be designed to present your argument clearly and persuasively. (The order in which you discovered the parts of your argument is seldom an effective order for presenting it to a reader.)
       
4. Successful methods of composing an essay are various, but some practices of good writers are almost invariable:
       
* They start writing early, even before they think they are &quot;ready&quot; to write, because they use writing not simply to transcribe what they have already discovered but as a means of exploration and discovery.
* They don&#39;t try to write an essay from beginning to end, but rather write what seems readiest to be written, even if they&#39;re not sure whether or how it will fit in.
* Despite writing so freely, they keep the essay&#39;s overall purpose and organization in mind, amending them as drafting proceeds. Something like an &quot;outline&quot; constantly and consciously evolves, although it may never take any written form beyond scattered, sketchy reminders to oneself.
* They revise extensively. Rather than writing a single draft and then merely editing its sentences one by one, they attend to the whole essay and draft and redraft--rearranging the sequence of its larger parts, adding and deleting sections to take account of what they discover in the course of composition. Such revision often involves putting the essay aside for a few days, allowing the mind to work indirectly or subconsciously in the meantime and making it possible to see the work-in-progress more objectively when they return to it.
* Once they have a fairly complete and well-organized draft, they revise sentences, with special attention to transitions--that is, checking to be sure that a reader will be able to follow the sequences of ideas within sentences, from sentence to sentence, and from paragraph to paragraph. Two other important considerations in revising sentences are diction (exactness and aptness of words) and economy (the fewest words without loss of clear expression and full thought). Lastly, they proofread the final copy.

----------------------------------Following posted by Ron--------------------------------
Don&#39;t start sentences using the word But, or Because. 

Don&#39;t use slang. (I failed an essay once in 7th grade when I did this.)

Use descriptive words. You probably don&#39;t read and have a poor vocabulary. That is very bad. You need to read and improve on that. No more... &quot;The fat guy fell into the pool&quot; type of setences. Use setences like &quot;The obese foolish man was not being cautious since he was so drunk, he lost his balance and fell right into the pool.&quot; 

Here are some more Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts.

<p>Yeah a lot of teachers take off points. Better be safe, than sorry.</p>
<p>Explain what you’re defending when you are saying because. Don’t just say…</p>
<p>Because the girl was so hot, I couldn’t do anything to stop myself (but why would I any way lol?).</p>
<p>Say instead…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I was out late</span> becayse the girl was so hot… etc</p>
<p>I got points off for starting sentences with Because and most teachers would do the same.</p>

<p>Hey what’s up with some of your sentences? They look like this.</p>
<blockquote>â€¢   Donâ€™t have run on sentences. Use commas and semicolons.
<p>â€¢   Donâ€™t use the same words again and again.</p>
</blockquote><br>
lol. Weird.

              <p>Okay first of all. The problem with most essays is that the content is disorganized. You may have great ideas and facts that you want to write about, but somewhere during the writing process you start mixing them up. Suddenly your perfect paper sounds all wrong and you want to scream!</p>
<p>What you need to do is have a good solid outline. Once you have an outline down, your paper writes itself. Your thoughts are organized and the teacher can understand your main point (which is your thesis) and how you supported that thesis. You need to be focused, and that is the key to writing a good essay.</p>
<p>This is a good outline format that they teach in school. I have been following this format and have had 98-100%'s on my essays.</p>
<p>I. Topic / Title</p>
<p>II. Introduction of Essay<br>
A. Grab the reader’s attention. Then write a few sentences (2 or 3) that lead into the main point of your essay<br>
B. End the paragraph with your thesis statement (3 main points you are going to support)<br>
1. First point in thesis<br>
2. Second point in thesis<br>
3. Third point in thesis</p>
<p>III. Body of Essay<br>
A. First Paragraph - First point in Thesis<br>
1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence<br>
2. Have at least five sentences<br>
B. Second Paragraph - Second point in Thesis<br>
1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence<br>
2. Have at least five sentences<br>
C. Third Paragraph - Third Point in Thesis<br>
1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence<br>
2. Have at least five sentences</p>
<p>IV. Conclusion<br>
A. Write a few sentences summarizing your essay<br>
B. Restate your thesis and how you proved your point</p>
<p>Here are some other pointers.</p>
<p>Don’t have run on sentences. Use commas and semicolons.</p>
<p>Don’t use the same words again and again.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some more help.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Miscellaneous observations on a topic are not enough to make an accomplished academic essay. An essay should have an argument. It should answer a question or a few related questions (see 2 below). It should try to  prove something–develop a single “thesis” or a short set of closely related points–by reasoning and evidence, especially including apt examples and confirming citations from any particular text or sources your argument involves. Gathering such evidence normally entails some rereading of the text or sources with a question or provisional thesis in mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When–as is usually the case–an assigned topic does not provide you with a thesis ready-made, your first effort should be to formulate as exactly as possible the question(s) you will seek to answer in your essay. Next, develop by thinking, reading, and jotting a provisional thesis or hypothesis. Don’t become prematurely committed to this first answer. Pursue it, but test it–even to the point of consciously asking yourself what might be said against it–and be ready to revise or qualify it as your work progresses. (Sometimes a suggestive possible title one discovers early can serve in the same way.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many ways in which any particular argument may be well presented, but an essay’s organization–how it begins, develops, and ends–should be designed to present your argument clearly and persuasively. (The order in which you discovered the parts of your argument is seldom an effective order for presenting it to a reader.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Successful methods of composing an essay are various, but some practices of good writers are almost invariable:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>They start writing early, even before they think they are “ready” to write, because they use writing not simply to transcribe what they have already discovered but as a means of exploration and discovery.</li>
<li>They don’t try to write an essay from beginning to end, but rather write what seems readiest to be written, even if they’re not sure whether or how it will fit in.</li>
<li>Despite writing so freely, they keep the essay’s overall purpose and organization in mind, amending them as drafting proceeds. Something like an “outline” constantly and consciously evolves, although it may never take any written form beyond scattered, sketchy reminders to oneself.</li>
<li>They revise extensively. Rather than writing a single draft and then merely editing its sentences one by one, they attend to the whole essay and draft and redraft–rearranging the sequence of its larger parts, adding and deleting sections to take account of what they discover in the course of composition. Such revision often involves putting the essay aside for a few days, allowing the mind to work indirectly or subconsciously in the meantime and making it possible to see the work-in-progress more objectively when they return to it.</li>
<li>Once they have a fairly complete and well-organized draft, they revise sentences, with special attention to transitions–that is, checking to be sure that a reader will be able to follow the sequences of ideas within sentences, from sentence to sentence, and from paragraph to paragraph. Two other important considerations in revising sentences are diction (exactness and aptness of words) and economy (the fewest words without loss of clear expression and full thought). Lastly, they proofread the final copy.</li>
</ul>
