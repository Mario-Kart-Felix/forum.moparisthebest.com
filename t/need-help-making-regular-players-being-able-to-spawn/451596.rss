<p>option one:</p>
<p>go into commands.java and press ctrl+f.<br>
now type in ("item or ("pickup<br>
do whatever your code is for instance my code is ::item so i would type ("item<br>
now heres what it may look like: if (playerCommand.startsWith(“item”) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3) { it should look similar<br>
now heres what you change if (playerCommand.startsWith(“item”) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3<br>
now change that 3 or a 2 into a 0.<br>
now it should read:if (playerCommand.startsWith(“item”) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 0) {</p>
<p>option 2<br>
go into client.java and press ctrl+f.<br>
now type in ("item or ("pickup<br>
