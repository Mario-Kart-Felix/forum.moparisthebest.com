    <title>Need to make skill bases</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-to-make-skill-bases/283141</link>
    <description>I&#39;m on PwnScape3 source and some skills are missing and I never have done skills, here are the missing skills:
RuneCrafting
Farming(dont really need)
Fletching
Herblore
Smithing
Mining
Fishing
Cooking
Firemaking.

I don&#39;t know if those are easy to fix, but I heard from somewhere that I could take the skills base from All-star or another source and put it in my source filesm if this is true I just need someone to tell me where to put it.

;3

Thanks-
