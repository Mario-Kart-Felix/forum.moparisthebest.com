    <title>Decompiling RSC private server clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decompiling-rsc-private-server-clients/215503</link>
    <description>So I tried decompiling some RSC private server clients. They had no obfuscation. I used DJ Java decompiler(which is based on JAD), also tried JAD by itself alone. They managed to decompile it, but with errors.

[code]Parsing mudclient.class...Parsing inner class mudclient$1.class... Generating mudclient.java
Couldn&#39;t resolve all exception handlers in method handleIncomingPacket
Couldn&#39;t resolve all exception handlers in method getServerStatus[/code]

For example this.
I even tried with a client that I had source for to eliminate the obfuscation possibility. Same thing.

Any suggestions on decompilers? JODE totally fucked up itself.

The client I&#39;m trying to decompile. Could someone try? I&#39;ve included the files for making a new build of it.</description>

              <p>Provided the client will recompile, they arn’t errors and it has been successfully decompiled.<br>
I haven’t personally tried.<br>
In my opinion the best way to write a bot for an RSC private server is to download the standard 202 client (or whichever the server uses) and modify whatever needs modifying for the server to accept it.</p>
