              <p>ok, firstly u say it goes to winrar, so where ever you saved you’re source, you should see (for me its a pile of books) and it should have the name of the source.<br>
now right click on whatever your source is, which should be a book looking thing<br>
now click extract to specified folder<br>
now you should get a yellow folder under this or above depending on your computer<br>
now just open up the folder and you should see things like, client.java, autospawn<br>
mainly just a bunch of folders,<br>
now for most editing go to the tutorial section<br>
also if its not working<br>
download<br>
Mod Taharoks<br>
server source builder.<br>
cant remember url<br>
then pick a source you like and follow the steps above</p>
<p>btw santa pker, just because hes new doesnt mean you have to be rude… always help when you can</p>
