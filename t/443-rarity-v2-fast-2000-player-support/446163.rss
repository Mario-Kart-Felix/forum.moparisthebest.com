    <title>[443] Rarity V2 - Fast 2000 Player Support</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/443-rarity-v2-fast-2000-player-support/446163</link>
    <description>[b]Quick Big Update: [/b]This project is being converted to be a 443 server. For the latest updates, check the latest replies in the thread. It&#39;s no longer going to be all about optimization and a fast update loop, because there are many things I can do that I don&#39;t want to, like event-based &quot;mask updating&quot; that will reduce the loop time to below 10ms with 2000 players.

Welcome to the development thread of yet another server of mine. You probably remember Rarity, a server I claimed was fast and well-done, but the truth is, it had many underlying problems. Actually, Lex did, since that was what Rarity was based off. So, I decided to start a server from scratch and completely change the way the core is written (Thanks to Super for the help).

Simply put, the server uses asynchronous networking and tasks - if you don&#39;t know what tasks are, [url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.task.aspx]read up on them[/url]. This allows for as little processing as possible, and the server runs great on a multi-core machine.

Another big thing this server has on Rarity is bots now properly work - they won&#39;t get disconnected over time, and the AGF bot can actually connect to it. However, it has a couple of problems. I disabled packet encryption because of a very weird bug with packet receiving. The first packet would be okay, then the next batch would be all messed up, then they would be completely fine afterwards. I&#39;m not sure about sending them, but I disabled both encryptions anyway. When a large number of bots are connected, say 500, only about 495 would actually be connected when it finished. I have no idea what&#39;s going on here, but I&#39;m not really concerned about it.

So with about 500 players or so, the performance is still very decent on my computer. All packet processing is still perfectly instant, whereas in Rarity it would be nearly impossible to process packets within a reasonable amount of time. I am happy with the performance. Here&#39;s a screenshot (the 129ms is for the 294 players and the rest is for the 101).

So what is there for content? Well, pretty much nothing, but now that I have the core out of the way, I plan on copying everything else Rarity had and cleaning up what I&#39;ve got and adding combat. My goal for this project is to create a fast and functional C# server ready for content to be added. Hopefully I&#39;ll reach it!

              <p>Today, even though again I didn’t get a ton of time to work, I fixed some core and NPC bugs. Core issues were things like the client would hang or freeze when connecting to the server, but I seem to have fixed that. I also fixed how NPCs were processed and when they were marked as idle and not processed. That said, updating now properly works.</p>
<p>I also got path finding and entity following implemented, which took a lot longer than I expected because the map dumps I was using that I made from the original Rarity were bad, so I re-dumped them and the paths started being correct. Now all I have to do is fix how NPCs are added and removed to/from the local list for players and that will be that. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

I wanted to let everyone know I am working on this. I abandoned it last time because I lost interest, had no motivation, and I couldn’t get walking to work. Well, I randomly decided to pick it up again today, fixed walking, and am going to finish movement and start porting the content from Rarity 317. This project, although I don’t know how long for, is currently active.<br>

<p>Here we go again. Let’s fire back up <span class="hashtag">#actualrsps</span>[/quote]Might as well. I’m currently in it!</p>
<p>Thanks for the support already. Didn’t expect to get much of it this soon, so thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I just finished walking/movement, which includes running. In the past, the walking packet wasn’t handled properly because it treated the Y byte as an unsigned byte, which messed things up. Players didn’t get added to local lists when moving either because I must have been drugged up or really retarded when I wrote the code that was supposed to do it. It’s all fixed now, and I can start adding NPCs and porting code from the 317 Rarity, which include perfect following/clipping, NPC/object actions, stat/weapon stuff, shopping, trading, etc…</p>

“Just as an idea, Hunter was released on the 438 revision on November 21, 2006. This is before the dark bow, God Wars, wilderness ditch, clan chat, achievement diary, and loot share (At least those are the major ones before the popular revision 474).” It’s the 2006 Christmas client.</p>
