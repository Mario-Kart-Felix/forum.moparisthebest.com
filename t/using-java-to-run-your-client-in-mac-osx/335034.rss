    <description>[center][b]~RSPS Clients MAC friendly~[/b][/center]

Java is an cross platform language that almost all operating systems have support for so its natural that macs should run rsps clients aswell. 
      minimal requirements to run a client on mac
[code]mac 10.4 with all java updates works with powerpc processor aswell as intel.[/code]
      in order to complete this tutorial you must have
[code]a client will all the .java files!! (will be explained later)[/code]

index 
I. Compiling client on a mac
II. Running client
III. Extras

I. COMPILING CLIENT on a mac
  Mac already has jdk installed onto it so we get to skip a few steps compared to windows.
now you need to make a file with an .sh ending or a terminal file.
now in that code you have to put
[code]
cd */servername
javac -verbose *.java
[/code]
   Explaining the code.
now say that your client is in a folder called servername.
[code] cd */servername[/code]
cd means to change directory, the reason why there is a * before the folders name is because the * starts off the directory at desktop rather than having to do &quot;/Users/loginname/desktop&quot; especially since you probably wont know the  persons log in name. then where it says servername, that is where you put the name of your folder.
  so right now you are in the directory where all of your clients files are.
now the 
[code]javac -verbose *.java[/code]
javac is the command that compiles the java files into class files.
the -verbose isn&#39;t necessary to compile the files, but it displays what is being compiled.
and finally *.java just means all files that end in .java will be compiled.

   now lets compile the client.
 if you have an error that says that the signlink is messed up you have to delete signlink.class and recompile. This error usually happens when the signlink.class was compiled by windows. 

II. Running the client
 now if you run your client on windows, in your run.bat there should be a line that looks something like this.
[code]start JavaW -Xmx800m client[/code]
all we have to do is convert this to work in terminal
so make a terminal or shell file named run
and add this in it.
[code]cd */serversname
java -Xmx500m EGUI[/code]
the cd */serversname is the directory as explained above.
java -Xmx500m EGUI just says where to start running the client.
now if you there is an error then you didnt compile with the mac like it says above.
        Extras:
 You can add this line to the end of the compile file to make the computer say the the client has been compiled.
[code]say compiling complete[/code]
and with mac you can make a listen to me! instead of a read me file =] for example.
[code]say in order to run server run the sh or terminal file, compile, and if there is an error remove signlink.class and recompile. after that run the shell or terminal file , run.[/code]

 if you have any questions or anyway that i can improve this tutorial please post here. enjoy

&quot;i will reread tomarrow after i get some sleep, so dont be expecting it to be easy to understand yet lol&quot;</description>

Do you even have a EGUI class in your client? I am guessing not, change EGUI to client, and if that doesnt work look for the class that starts your client.</p>
