    <title>Hard Drives?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hard-drives/209678</link>
    <description>Alright I have an external hard drive and my built in one. The problem is that somehow when i reinstalled windows it thinks my external drive is my C:/ drive and my normal drive is my F:/ drive. I also have another partition named D:/ but that does not matter. Anyways my problem with this is that everything is installed on my F:/ drive but someone things install onto my C:/ drive which is annoying the hell out of me because it is spamming my drive with random shit. So an ideas on how to fix that?</description>
