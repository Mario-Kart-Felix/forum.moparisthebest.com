<p>That is probably the worst shit I ever seen… Only good thing with prq is that they are located in Sweden.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jack">@Jack</a>; Take a look at this site <a href="http://yardvps.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://yardvps.com/</a><br>
Very cheap, very good support.<br>
[/quote]Uh, and they don’t give a shit about copyright infringement? Can you elaborate as to why prq is shit?</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>, don’t listen to this retard. If you end up not caring about copyright infringement… <a href="http://lowendbox.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://lowendbox.com</a> and <a href="http://webhostingtalk.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://webhostingtalk.com</a> … otherwise prq is good for you.[/quote]<br>
Why would he pay from 100-300 US Dollar to host King-PK? EDIT: with RSC that <span class="bbcode-b">mostly</span> do not give a damn shit about copyright?<br>
And get fucked for another 107 US dollars /hour, everytime you need help?</p>
<p>Also if you use google, you can se that they are not good at what they are doing, mostly down and very expensive. I think that’s enough for saying PRQ is shit.</p>
<p>The other you mentioned are quite good though.</p>
