    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ps3-lobbies-hacked/342096</link>
    <description>WE NOW GOT SUPER SPEED AND SHIT; MAY NOTICE IT, HERES THE SHIT.
Teh hack is called [B]INFECTIONS[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;1.) Do you stay infected? 
- No because the infection is stored in the game cache, so when you turn your console off, the infection also goes. 

2.) What can I be infected?
- Mostly speed, unless your with hunter. 

3.) If someone goes into hunters then infects me will I get them? 
- No, you need to be directly infected by hunter. 

4.) Can I get into a lobby?
- Ask around, lots of people are running these lobbies.

5.) How does he do it? 
- By editing the patch.

6.) What consoles are they on? 
- Xbox 360 and PS3

7.) How? I mean, I went into an speed infection lobby, then quitted (didn&#39;t turn off my console neither did I leave the multiplayer menu) and then randomly selected Team Deathmatch and when I got in the game, I wasn&#39;t infected. Must I be the host of that Team Deathmatch to have the infection?
- Yes, you need to be host otherwise you will lose the infection, as settings are refreshed.

8.) I know the Xbox ones work online (in ranked matches), how about these ones? 
- They only work if you are host, and becuase of the host migration etc, it is highly unlikely that you will get host.

9.) Do I need to bypass? 
- No you do not need to bypass.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

              <p>Since when did it turn up on PS3?</p>
<p>Do you realize what an infection/challenge lobby really is? It’s basically a 10th prestige lobby. Since I have been in one…I might as well explain what goes on. (This is for XBox 360).</p>
<p>You join the lobby - depending if you got it free, paid for it, are getting an invite (takes forever), or joining in progress to a free lobby (takes forever). When you are in, you will most likely, depending on the lobby, need to be verified by the lobby owner by them killing you.</p>
<p>When you are verified, you will have many things all over your screen. Some will say, “press LEFT LEFT for 48 HOUR NUKE” or, “While crouching, press DOWN DOWN for all challenges, titles, and emblems.” The same goes for level 70, and other infections. Another option is just killing someone for everything.</p>
<p>Infections are any abnormal thing that goes on in the game. This varies from high running speed, super jump, M16/Famas full automatic, etc.</p>
<p>Sticky infections are infections that will stay with you out of that modded lobby, following you into live. I have gone into live before with an aimbot, huge UAV, developer’s view, etc.</p>
<p>So in reality, this is OLD unless it just happened for PS3…</p>
