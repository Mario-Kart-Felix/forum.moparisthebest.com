    <title>Problem making offline server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-making-offline-server/469979</link>
    <description>I&#39;m just trying to play hybridscape from the moparscape 3.2 client, but I cant. I have tried clicking &quot;Start server&quot; and making a new user, but it tells me that username is already logged in. I am trying to use 127.0.0.1, but neither that, localhost, or 0.0.0.0 work. Any suggestions?

This is what the prompt says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[07:21:40] Couldn&#39;t open output stream to log file Player 1-20121125.log
[07:21:40]

              <p>Why is your server printing</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Instead of the actual error? See, if whoever made hybridscape was smart enough to use the ‘printStackTrace()’ method we could see the source, even the exact line that is causing the error.</p>
<p>Sometimes the reason why certain clients don’t work with servers is because of player updating. It doesn’t seem like it in this case though.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to replace that server exception message with print stack trace so we can see the actual error</p>
