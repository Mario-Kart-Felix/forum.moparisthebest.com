    <description>[b]No Virus![/b] I would never do that, because it&#39;s wrong and illegal.

[b]Website:[/b]project-optimum.boards.net

[b]Webclient:[/b] rswebclients.com/play/Project Optimum [b]or[/b] on the website webclient link!

[b]Date Released:[/b] July 19 2013

[b]Player Base:[/b] 2 :D!

[b]Spawn/Pk Server[/b]




This server used to be #1 on rswebclients toplist couple months ago, but it shut down. I was a player back then and a loyal player, we reached around 30 players and a lot of fun. Will I am going to recreate this server and put the fun in rswebclients. You can trust this server it will be on daily, and it will never shutdown like lots of the servers on rswebclients.
I will buy a domain once I get donations because this server is for players, so the community tells me what they want and I will do it, but their has to be some of my decisions too :), I will use some of my money to buy a domain.
