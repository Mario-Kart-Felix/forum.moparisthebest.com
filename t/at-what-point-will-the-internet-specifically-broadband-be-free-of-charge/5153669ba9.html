<p>love is free :3<br>

No it isn’t. You have to work for it.[/quote]<br>
it depends on your meaning of free.</p>
<p>Most would think if I don’t have to spend any money on a good/service then it is free to them. Sure it it may be free to you but with the way currency and trade works it costs someone something along the line considering anyone with the choice would never work for free.</p>
<p>Now if you define free by meaning that nothing was done to obtain something then sure nothing can truly be free except for the state of existence. but love in an aspect can be free as in Storge love(the kind of love parents have for their children). The parents didn’t work to love the child and the child didn’t work to be loved yet the love is present.</p>
<p>I think as a world community we should take this economic crisis and instead of take years or decades to recover or draw out the suffering of everyone just to follow the principles of trade and currency or even agreeing to have a world wide currency reset we should just agree to get rid of the idea of currency altogether. This would take a lot of planning, and work to execute but would put humanity in a better standing and even increase our productivity and technological advances. Everyone would have more opportunity. Everyone would just live better lives because everyone would be able to go to bed full and with a roof over their head. I was thinking everyone could work 20 hour weeks(5 hours a day 4 days a week. and the basic layout for the week would be work 2 days, rest a day, work 2 more days, 2 day “weekend”, and repeat). working 20 hours a week would be all that is required to be able to be able to eat and have a place to call home, while also have the ability to have plenty of personal time to spend with family or friends. People wouldn’t be able to hoard things because they would have an allowance on how many items one can have for enjoyment or luxury; after that amount is reached they most trade it in for something else. Everything would be quality made to last because fixing things is a waste of time and since currency doesn’t exist no profit can be gained on fixing broken things.</p>
<p>Also sure star trek is fictional but it can still be used to help better society as a whole and in star trek they don’t have money and they aren’t paid to work, they work for the betterment of the community which is what we all should strive to think like because we would be better off if we did so.</p>
<p>don’t mean to got off topic here but about your signature you may want to understand the meaning of well-regulated. Also the second amendment should be broken into 2 sentence since most people think both parts go together when they really don’t. It should be read as, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State. The right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” because that is how the founder intended it to be read. <a href="http://constitution.org/cons/wellregu.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://constitution.org/cons/wellregu.htm</a> <a href="http://www.guncite.com/gc2ndmea.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.guncite.com/gc2ndmea.html</a> If there is to be a conversation started about this there is no need to reply, you can start a thread in the appropriated section or send a message.</p>
