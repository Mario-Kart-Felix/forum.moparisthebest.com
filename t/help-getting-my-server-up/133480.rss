    <title>Help ! Getting my server up!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-getting-my-server-up/133480</link>
    <description>I have recently port-forwarded with a Netgear router hoping that it would allow me to have people access my router. yet, to no avail. I am about to try the port-forwarding section again. Incase I have done something wrong, but is there anything I&#39;m missing? When I go to go on my server, I can&#39;t go on at the No-ip I set only the 0.0.0.0 43594 default server host login. Can anyone please give me the final tips I need, Anyone that helps will recieve rep++ unless you just come and say &quot;Portforward&quot; then leave or something..

Please help!

Anyone!!!!!</description>

              <p>You can portfoward the server through hamachi. It’s not recommended but it’s possible.</p>
