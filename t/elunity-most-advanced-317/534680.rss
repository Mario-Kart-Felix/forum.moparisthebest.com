Elunity is not like your average servers you see around here it is very unique.  The server is 24/7, has a very experienced team and has custom which no other server has.  The server has grate load of bosses so the PvM’s are spoiled for choice and PvP’s are just as spoiled with all the spec weapons  in-game. Elunity allows players to use the yell (::yell) cannel without having to donate, all you need is over one hour online time, this is to stop any advertisers. 

Quests:
We have 7 quests already done, not including holiday quests!
We currently have our Halloween quest out!

Elunity Home:
Here at Elunity we decided to change thing up rather than having home/starting place at edge like every other server; we decided to have our home based in Port Phasmatys. We also based out teleports such as god wars and mini-games.

Main commands:
For all the following command you will need to write two colon’s (:: ) then followed by the name of the command without any space.

The commands are:
Dz (Donator zone)
Home (Port Phasmatys)
Hbank (homebank)
Mine (To mine rune essence)
 Pk (Mage bank)
Team (Staff team)
Yell (self-explanatory)
People (tells you how many people at pits) 
Modhelp (lets mods know you need help and they will come and see you)
Jad (fight cave)
Players (who is on, and how many)

Skills:
Once again Elunity decided they were going to do thing different from other severs rather than having levels going up to 99, we had them going up to 126 with a max xp of 250m and a max combat level of 160, but is wildness it will change to max level going up to 110 and max combat level of 140 (this changes back once you leave the wildness).

PvP:
The main place on Elunity for player killing is hill giants. The main weapons been Dragon Claws Dark bow, Night bow (costom), Seren Godsword (costom), Dragon Cross bow, Vesta long sword and also has all regular godswords, along with &quot;E&quot; Godswords  donaters.

When you have killed a player you will get 2 pk points which allows you to later spend the pk points on a certain rewards from the Pk shop. There are also recorded stats for your kills, you will have the ability to wear the Player killing skill capes. 200 kills for Un-trimmed cape, 400 kills &amp; .6 ratio for (t) cape, and 600 kills &amp; .8 ratio for (m) cape.

Pvm:
Elunity has wide range of bosses for to go PvM, some of them are; Sea Troll Queen, Jad, Dagganoth Kings, Mithril Dragon, King Black Dragon, Kalphite Queen. But the best bosses are Bandos, Armadyl, Zammy, Saradomin and Corporeal Beast.
These monsters drop the most valuable items on Elunity.

Donators:
You get a 15% increase on all experience you gain, ability to go to  donatorzone ,donator shop, spirit shields, ability to go to the corporeal beast and tormented demons, Vengance, Donator godswords, and much more! 

Backup:
Backups are always being generated and saved!

<p>Elunity is not like your average servers you see around here it is very unique.  The server is 24/7, has a very experienced team and has custom which no other server has.  The server has grate load of bosses so the PvM’s are spoiled for choice and PvP’s are just as spoiled with all the spec weapons  in-game. Elunity allows players to use the yell (::yell) cannel without having to donate, all you need is over one hour online time, this is to stop any advertisers.</p>
<p>Quests:<br>
We have 7 quests already done, not including holiday quests!<br>
We currently have our Halloween quest out!<br>
<img src="http://img580.imageshack.us/img580/4117/7s3p.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Elunity Home:<br>
Here at Elunity we decided to change thing up rather than having home/starting place at edge like every other server; we decided to have our home based in Port Phasmatys. We also based out teleports such as god wars and mini-games.</p>
<p>Main commands:<br>
For all the following command you will need to write two colon’s (:: ) then followed by the name of the command without any space.</p>
<p>The commands are:<br>
Dz (Donator zone)<br>
Home (Port Phasmatys)<br>
Hbank (homebank)<br>
Mine (To mine rune essence)<br>
Pk (Mage bank)<br>
Team (Staff team)<br>
Yell (self-explanatory)<br>
People (tells you how many people at pits)<br>
Modhelp (lets mods know you need help and they will come and see you)<br>
Jad (fight cave)<br>
Players (who is on, and how many)</p>
<p>Skills:<br>
Once again Elunity decided they were going to do thing different from other severs rather than having levels going up to 99, we had them going up to 126 with a max xp of 250m and a max combat level of 160, but is wildness it will change to max level going up to 110 and max combat level of 140 (this changes back once you leave the wildness).</p>
<p>PvP:<br>
The main place on Elunity for player killing is hill giants. The main weapons been Dragon Claws Dark bow, Night bow (costom), Seren Godsword (costom), Dragon Cross bow, Vesta long sword and also has all regular godswords, along with “E” Godswords  donaters.</p>
<p>When you have killed a player you will get 2 pk points which allows you to later spend the pk points on a certain rewards from the Pk shop. There are also recorded stats for your kills, you will have the ability to wear the Player killing skill capes. 200 kills for Un-trimmed cape, 400 kills &amp; .6 ratio for (t) cape, and 600 kills &amp; .8 ratio for (m) cape.</p>
<p>Pvm:<br>
Elunity has wide range of bosses for to go PvM, some of them are; Sea Troll Queen, Jad, Dagganoth Kings, Mithril Dragon, King Black Dragon, Kalphite Queen. But the best bosses are Bandos, Armadyl, Zammy, Saradomin and Corporeal Beast.<br>
These monsters drop the most valuable items on Elunity.</p>
<p>Donators:<br>
You get a 15% increase on all experience you gain, ability to go to  donatorzone ,donator shop, spirit shields, ability to go to the corporeal beast and tormented demons, Vengance, Donator godswords, and much more!</p>
<p>Backup:<br>
