    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rares/537213</link>
    <description>In my opinion, im 50/50 on Jagex&#39;s decision to pump rares into the game making them not &#39;rares&#39; anymore. I think it&#39;s cool because the items aren&#39;t worth as much as they were priced, but at the same time Rares to me were always wealth goals in the old days . Do you guys agree with their decision to do this? Explain.</description>

              <p>I’m fine with their decision to make rares not rare in 07 just because if they were rare the economy would be based more on rares then it is currently. If rares were worth something though I would not mind that all just because I like to set wealth goals and reach them.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Flame_, post:2, topic:537213”]It’s cool to see that rares can be obtained freely now, in my opinion. They used to be representative of the wealthy and veterans, but now that anyone can get them, the newer players get that “thrill” of wearing a party hat in the live game and not just being envious of those around them. I wasn’t around when rares were initially introduced, and I never made enough money to purchase any of them either, so I suppose that’s where my logic is coming from. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Sure, it’d be cool if I did have one and the items were exclusive to a one-time event, but now that there’s the option to get them once a year, newer players and older players alike can join in on that “thrill.” :)[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s exactly how I feel. It’s awesome that players don’t have to feel broke over a paper hat lol.</p>
