    <title>Rares</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rares/462885</link>
    <description>Do you find servers that use the normal Runescape rares (party hats, h&#39;weens, etc) more fun or servers that make their own rares and sometimes use the Runescape ones for other things (such as dress shops or monster drops)?

I prefer custom rares, just wanting some other opinions as I&#39;m working on a server again.</description>

              <p>Protip: Rare items don’t have to be the standard “party hat, h’ween mask, etc”. Any item can be made ‘Rare’ if you choose to do so. This makes distribution a lot easier.</p>

              <p>I really don’t like the idea of having rares in the game, but I also hate the fact that players will miss out on having them. There are two problems you will face when deciding how to distribute them:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Means of distribution; amount to be dispersed and how they are dispersed[/li]<br>
[li]Possible loss of players; people will certainly quit due to their anger of not receiving one, which is really no one’s fault, except for themselves for being in the wrong place at the right time[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Handling this will be a good way to practice your management skills, because you will always have to make tough decisions, in which not everyone will agree.</p>

<p>That sounds great and all, but at that time, nobody knew what the masks were, nor did they know they contained ANY value. Now everybody knows those items possess a high amount of value in them.

He was saying that it’s not much of a rare considering everyone who plays rs knows what the masks are, witch is why I want to stray away from using the traditional rares, they’re too overused and people know they’re valuable.  I wouldn’t mind using partyhats for like the Drop party room or something, that might be kind of interesting, but they would be super common, like getting them out of a crate for free.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t announce that they’re rare though, just post that they’re discontinued in a future update, that way people won’t instantly start selling them for more than the entire economy each.</p>

I don’t know why, but I like it, especially considering that no one would suspect that you get partyhats that way, or maybe you shape it like a Christmas cracker, then enchant it or something like that, from there open it up, I think that would be better considering that different phat colors would have different prices</p>

<p>It all depends on how scarce you make the item. If something useful were hard to get it would become rare.

<p>Yeah, I want partyhats to be obtained though a quest I’m working on.  I’m just trying to brainstorm some ideas for some items that would be the literal ‘rare’ and only obtainable for a limited time.  I know this can be a bad idea in some cases, but it’s also just a nice vanity as compared to everything being obtained from donations, monster drops, etc.<br>

<p>[quote]the literal ‘rare’ and only obtainable for a limited time.[/quote] Do you mean event based, like over a holiday such as Christmas? Or do you mean like a consumable. You could always try work with a consumable, such as a ‘rare’ fish or elixir that you could give some bonuses or something cool which would make the player want to either use it for their benefit or sell it as a ‘rare’ to someone else who will use it.</p>
<p>You could also make like a golden hammer a 1 time use item that is used to craft something. Just throwing some suggestions out. I have thought a lot about all this and thought I might share some since I haven’t really been motivated to start anything for myself due to my depression, I’ve just had no motivation for anything. But if you need to ask anything just hit me up an inbox and I’ll get around to it sooner or later.[/quote]<br>
More than likely though holidays or something similar,yeah</p>

              <p>You need to adjust the rares to your player base, make everything just about impossible to get in the beginning, don’t even bother making dragon claws a drop IMO if you don’t have their power lowered, and make party hats obtainable from some party oriented mini-games maybe?
