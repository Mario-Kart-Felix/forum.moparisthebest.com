    <title>Crasher Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crasher-problem/318099</link>
    <description>Ok so a few days ago I have started getting some craasher guy on my 508 Bulby source. All I get is &quot;Connection received from (his ip)&quot; like a hundred times until my server cashes, and then he does it again? How can I add his ip to bannedhosts.dat, because it doesnt seem to work, can someone show me an example of what I am supposed to do. It&#39;s just that the crasher hadn&#39;t made an account on my server 0.0

Thanks a lot,

              <p>some ppl are able to change there ip in like 3 mins and he probably has a cheat client which you can find something for when it gets a connection for one it blocks</p>

              <p>You can’t really ban his ip, since he uses a different one (hard 2 explain… :S)</p>
<p>Also, I’m sure you can make it so that there can only be 1 connection per ip, theres a tut in it in the tutorial section. I think it might only be for 317s though. Also again, try not to use Bulby. It’s not so good.</p>
