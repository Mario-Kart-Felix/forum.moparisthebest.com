    <title>Map Data? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/map-data/266522</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve been browsing a few forums lately. On one of them, there&#39;s a huge craze over a 474 server/client, and they keep complaining how they dont have the mapdata serverside so they can&#39;t do much.

My question is:
What is mapdata and why is it needed serverside?

I&#39;ve looked through the 503 client and am able to identify the map data regions and such, but I am still unclear when it comes to what is mapdata, why is there, and if it already exists client-side, why is it needed server-side?

Any help/comments are appreciated. Thanks.

[b]EDIT:[/b]
Maybe it&#39;ll help if you understand what I know about it as of now. Currently, I know that when walking across the map and a region (still unloaded) appears black on the mini-map, a new map region is loaded. I&#39;m not sure how many regions there are loaded at once, but it seems that a region is unloaded/discarded when out of range. So if anybody could elaborate on that, that&#39;d be great.

[b]EDIT 2:[/b]
I looked a little further into it after editing my post last time, and quickly came across a conclusion. I was able to dump some data about a few regions (at Varrock Square) using the 503 client:


[code]A: 0
B: 1446102763
B: 1355166075
B: 586264619
B: 1060975024
A: 1
B: -424757646
B: 1138421849
B: -1625417991
B: 2062991820
A: 2
B: 525960416
B: -1265964384
B: 1915385223
B: 146842718
A: 3
B: 0

B: -1214992993
B: 1537351771
B: 1201190695
B: 708896891[/code]

I am, for some reason, stuck with the reasoning that A would be the ID of the current region loaded (on an index, not like it&#39;s actual ID like shown here: http://img236.imageshack.us/img236/5751/ss20080713124636le0.png). But, I&#39;m also convinced that the B data are the coordinates of the map region (and are somehow messed with before actually being used). The thing is though, my theory doesn&#39;t make sense because of the B data with a value of 0.</description>

<p>Lol.</p>
<p>The 317 MapData is stored in the cache. So would this mean that the newer versions also have the MapData somewhere clientside or the capabilities to generate it clientside, from what I understand, on the 504 client, the server handles each coordnation with a four-index array with each containing a size 10 signed integer. Although, someone I know found out a neat little algorithm for handling every map coordination.</p>
