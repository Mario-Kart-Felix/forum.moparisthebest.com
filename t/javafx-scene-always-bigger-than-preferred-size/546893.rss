Alright, so this happens with everything, Swing, JavaFX scenes via FXML, and hardcoded ones and it really makes no sense. There&#39;s certain applications with certain size restrictions that require them to be a certain size which is what makes me wonder why they are this way. Sometimes I&#39;ll boot up, open eclipse, and the application with the settings shown in the screenshot up above will have whitespace because it isn&#39;t 500x500, sometimes it&#39;s 502x502, other times its 510x510, the pixel offset varies on a day-to-day basis and I don&#39;t understand it. This happened with Swing too, no matter what I set the size to, it would always be offset. Any ideas as to why? Is this a thing that is known? I researched it and couldn&#39;t find anything, is this a bug or am I just doing something wrong?</description>

<p>Yeah I did, it still behaves the same. In the Scene builder preview it’s right, but when I instantiate it via Java it adds to the size.</p>

<p>Here’s another example, there’s white space around this whole image, because it would so appear that the stage is rendering as a larger size than the anchor pane, but if is set it’s max width/height nothing happens…</p>

<p>Exactly. There isn’t enough detail as to know why this is occurring, all I can do is tell it the size I want it to be, which it never turns out to be. Everything except for the preferred size is set to default, I just set the components to fit their VBox parent which makes it look alright, but in this application it doesn’t matter, however I have another which requires strict size restrictions, and this causes a problem.</p>
