    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-the-link-how-to-use-it-does-it-cost-anything/5211</link>
    <description>Ok I looked at other threads, no one seems to reply, but I&#39;ve been trying to find links and stuff to create your own server and to host it...even though I have no clue. Can any one tell me a good site, it&#39;s rules, how much it costs, and so long... I&#39;ve seen people actually use it and became those mods and admin. To me it feels like if I created my own server I would be on when I want to. I am on a lot for any one to use it, if the first person replie I could use him/her for a mod  ;). Just a little tip, but seriously how do I find where you create those servers and ip&#39;s...

A: In this Section click ‘RS2 Server Downloads’ and download a server (Hybridscape ftw)</p>
<p>Q: Can any one tell me a good site<br>
A: What do you mean?</p>
<p>Q: it’s rules<br>
A: Rules? None.</p>
<p>Q: how much it costs<br>
A: A Server is something you host on your own computer, so it is therefore free (Hence, if you turn your computer off, your Server is down too)</p>
