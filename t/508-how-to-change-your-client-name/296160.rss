    <title>[508] How To Change Your Client Name</title>

    <description>[size=30pt]Please post comments or do the poll, this will help me improve on what you think![/size]

This is for 508 client&#39;s, so if your looking on how to change a 317 client name, no point in carrying on reading. So, go into files &gt; Applet_Sub1 and go onto CTRL + F and search for whatever the clients called. Then just change that to what you want your client to be named, maybe to your server name and re-upload! Pretty simple. 

Hope this helped, I am not to sure on the IP Changer Client though.. If you can, download the berky-scape client, which should be on the Berky-Scape Source topic on Server Downloads and change that name instead.</description>
