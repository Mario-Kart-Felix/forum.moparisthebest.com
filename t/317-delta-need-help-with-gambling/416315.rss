              <p>It is possible, what needs to be done is you need to find a source with it probably most 602â€™s, and try looking at gambling.java<br>
After you find it, you will need to start looking at your source code, and start basically changing all the code to be in 317 format<br>
Then you need to find npc chat, and change it as well.<br>
If you need help feel free to PM me, because it probably wont be easy.<br>
Then you need to add in the things like if(bet10){<br>
c.getitem(995,100000000);</p>
<p>and so forth</p>
