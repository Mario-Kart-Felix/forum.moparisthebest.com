    <description>[center] [b][size=18pt]PLEASE READ BEFORE TROLLING, as I know you all will want to.[/size][/b]



Well, as the title says, I am just coming back to RSPS, and I have noticed a couple things.

-First off there are the same source downloads as when I left (about 6 months ago). Where is the originality that I know that you all have? All I see is leeches, and so forth. All the same thing, with a few differences like some xp deleters in different spots. I hoped to see a lot of originality when I came back, but I&#39;m not seeing anything to my liking, or slightly different for that matter...

-Second off, all I see on the servers running are almost worse if not exactly the same from when I left. Did y&#39;all just quit, and keep your servers running while you left, or whaa?

If anyone would like to tell me what you did while I was gone, I am here to listen, I&#39;m just confused. Not trying to stir up any anger or anything, just stating my position on this certain subject, and I&#39;m sorry if you have a varying opinion here.

Also, can someone share with me the most common used base, (when I left it was Delta and PI, but moving towards PI, but it is most likely still PI.), what y&#39;all did while I was gone, and some new findings that I may not have seen while I was scouring the forums?
IE: Lightened the cache, found ways to enhance summoning, etc?

Thanks so much.[/center]</description>

<p>If you all think there isn’t anything valuable about this thread you might all want to take a look at your posts and evaluate the way you look at this board. First off, this is <span class="bbcode-b">General Discussion</span> for <span class="bbcode-b">General Discussion</span>. Not saying there’s room here to talk about anything, but I see nothing wrong with what he’s posting about in here. You all act as if there has to be a goal or accomplishment of unfathomable achievement if you post in any board on this forum. It’s a forum, meant for discussion. If you’re going to cry about the importance of a post then tell me the importance of your input. Because to me it looks like you’re just stirring up a bowl of unimportance-soup with your unimportant rebuttals.</p>

              <p>Firstly, the reason there are no sources with better content is because people who are working on servers are extremely dedicated and aren’t releasing their sources. Secondly the servers that are running are servers of leechers so no you’re not going to find different ones.</p>
<p>If you want to see improvements in RSPS then you need to do it yourself, because people aren’t just going to give you their sources they worked on for months.</p>

<p>Well, as the title says, I am just coming back to RSPS, and I have noticed a couple things.</p>
<p>-First off there are the same source downloads as when I left (about 6 months ago). Where is the originality that I know that you all have? All I see is leeches, and so forth. All the same thing, with a few differences like some xp deleters in different spots. I hoped to see a lot of originality when I came back, but I’m not seeing anything to my liking, or slightly different for that matter…</p>
<p>-Second off, all I see on the servers running are almost worse if not exactly the same from when I left. Did y’all just quit, and keep your servers running while you left, or whaa?</p>
<p>If anyone would like to tell me what you did while I was gone, I am here to listen, I’m just confused. Not trying to stir up any anger or anything, just stating my position on this certain subject, and I’m sorry if you have a varying opinion here.</p>
<p>Also, can someone share with me the most common used base, (when I left it was Delta and PI, but moving towards PI, but it is most likely still PI.), what y’all did while I was gone, and some new findings that I may not have seen while I was scouring the forums?<br>
IE: Lightened the cache, found ways to enhance summoning, etc?</p>
<p>Thanks so much.[/center]</p>
