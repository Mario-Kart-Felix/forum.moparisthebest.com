              <p>If you’re going to start from scratch it’d be extremely difficult. Unless you extremely proficient with java I’d just doing what I done. Start with a full source, add some good things/remove bad things etc. Then start with a basic source, something that has the bare minimum, this is mainly so you have pretty much all the coding knowledge for the next bit. Start with a completely blank source. Nothing in there (except the blank files).</p>
<p>GL either way. I’d be willing to help if you ever needed help.</p>
