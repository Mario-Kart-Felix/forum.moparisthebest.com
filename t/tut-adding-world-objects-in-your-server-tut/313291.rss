    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-adding-world-objects-in-your-server-tut/313291</link>
    <description>Ok, this is my first tutorial, so dont flame me...

1. Open up client.java, and Hit CTRL + F. Type in GlobalObjects.
2. You should see a long list of objects. Find a random one and copy it.
3.Scroll down to the end of the list, and paste it at the end of the list.
4. Ok now, You should see a list of numbers going across. The first number is the X cooridinate. Second is the Y coordinate.
5. You want to Delete the X and Y cooridantes, and change them to where you want your object.
6. Go over one more set of numbers, and that is the object ID.
7. Change that to the object ID you want.
8. Change the name at the end of the list to whatever object you made.
9. Click file, save
10. Compile, and restart you server. 
Remember, this was my first tut...so no mean comments. Thanks bye!</description>
