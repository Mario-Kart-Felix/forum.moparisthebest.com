    <title>Zombie vs Manson</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zombie-vs-manson/517672</link>
    <description>Circumstances That Lead Me To Ask This: So i&#39;ve got two scores to settle, and here it goes.... The goth department of my class is split into two homicidal divisions, one is the mason homicide unit which believe slowly killing everyone with weapons works better than explosives, then there&#39;s the zombie division which enjoys blowing shit up everywhere. What is better and/or a good substitute for either? I could care less being into reggae music myself, buttt before my school mascot decides to kill everyone on the field he&#39;d love some advice from anyone who will listen.

Age Old Question: Rob Zombie vs Marilyn Manson.

<p>For one, manson’s music is terribly repetitive ever since he began getting more famous, he’s terribly sold out.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When people refer to an artist as having ‘sold out’ they do it in the sense that the artist abandons their earlier music style in favour of a new style that will sell better. What you’re referring to is something along the lines of milking a cow, doing more of the same because you’ve lost any creative spark. See: The Simpsons, the Simpsons haven’t sold out they’ve been milking the show for years.</p>

</aside>
<p>i have to say that there is solid truth in that, but his last concert was just scene guys and girls, allot of gay and transvestites, and almost nobody dressed like they did back in the trench-coat mafia era. Nothing wrong with being scene, gay, female, or transvestite. I am just saying the fanbase changed DRASTICALLY. I dunno maybe it’s just the area the concert was in.</p>

<p>so apperantly before lady gaga he was a rocker with ambition of bringing back his genre, i know he’s grown up, but tbh he’s sold out quite entirely.</p>
<p>It was about the music at first, now it’s all about the appearance for him. I dunno, maybe cause he’s old and can’t do the kinda drugs he used to. beats me as to why he’s changed so much.</p>

Manson is good at doing things in sick twisted ways. He allegedly sucked his own di<span class="bbcode-b"></span>ck on stage (I have no idea if this is true). I went to one of his concerts (Thanks KBPI [A radio station in my state]) and he brought someone out on stage (his ‘wife’) and had her killed via guillotine. Though I like the beauty of murder (meaning, how it’s done and the various ways it could be done), the ways Manson would go about it aren’t… Fast enough. More would be born than he killed. Music wise, he has a very very interesting twist to his songs.<br>
[/quote]<br>
No… just absolutely positively no.[/quote]<br>
now this i disagree on sk8rdude461<br>
For one, manson’s music is terribly repetitive ever since he began getting more famous, he’s terribly sold out. I’m starting to think his song ‘this is the new shit’ was serious when he meant shit. I understand if he’s going the way Reznor is going, but honestly Reznor still has more class.</p>
<p>Sucking your own dick on stage just makes you look like you’re either the boss or on drugs, and it makes no statement to how cool one is. Hell at the Twins of Evil concert he was the one bitching and practically sealed his own fate with Rob Zombie, and not to mention he lost all of his original band members to zombie.</p>
<p>The guy is a sellout, but that doesn’t mean i don’t enjoy his old music. Dope Hat is one of the best, no matter how repetitive it is.</p>
<blockquote>But whats with the creepy comment about killing everyone? Careful what you say on the internets. You'd be suprised how people can find out what school you go to.</blockquote>
c: my school wouldn't give a shit, especially considering im almost 20.

I don’t think that was necessary. Honestly, just because someone doesn’t like or care for something you do, that does not mean you can go around saying ridiculous things. Personally, i don’t like either. They both seem silly, i don’t think i’d waste my time on either.[/quote]<br>
I can go and say any ridiculous thing I please. It’s the internet, and if he/she listened to what I said, then he’d/she’d be a moron. Honestly your comment wasn’t necessary either.

              <p>Manson is good at doing things in sick twisted ways. He allegedly sucked his own di<span class="bbcode-b"></span>ck on stage (I have no idea if this is true). I went to one of his concerts (Thanks KBPI [A radio station in my state]) and he brought someone out on stage (his ‘wife’) and had her killed via guillotine. Though I like the beauty of murder (meaning, how it’s done and the various ways it could be done), the ways Manson would go about it aren’t… Fast enough. More would be born than he killed. Music wise, he has a very very interesting twist to his songs.<br>
Ex:<br>

<p>Rob Zombie on the other hand, is an amazing artist, and a man with many talents. Unlike Manson, Zombie doesn’t just play with death and music. Zombie likes special effects and directing movies. He just got done with The Lords Of Salem (which is also a song done by him), which is a horror film. You need to see the trailer to understand. He’d be great at killing loads of people. On the music side, he’s good, but his style gets old.<br>

I’m not for or against either. I like em both.</p>
