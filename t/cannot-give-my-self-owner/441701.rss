<p>Um, I researched torvapkz and erased, and apparently torva was originally erased. So i went to look into it, and like it more than torvapkz. But yeah, new source, like this more. All skills work. For some reason I cannot get owner on any new accounts i make.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s an anti-leech.</p>
<p>But to make yourself owner or admin, go into the playerSaves and find your account, open it with notepad or notepad++. Find “rights” without the “”. If you see 0 within rights, change it to 2 or 3.</p>
<p>Anyways, look inside of player.java and see if theirs a method that…well…causes your problem lol. Btw player.java is just a guess to look at.</p>
<p>PS: Did you switch sources already?lol?</p>
