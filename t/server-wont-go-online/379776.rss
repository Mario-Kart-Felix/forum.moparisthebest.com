    <title>Server won&#39;t go online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-wont-go-online/379776</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t understand why it won&#39;t work.. I have done all the portforwarding necessary to get it done. Tell me if I am wrong on this:

I portforwarded, and have IpDuc (did all the work with that, clicked the checkbox) as well as changed my TC/IP settings for it to work. I am doing it for a friend, I had a server 2 years ago and I am wondering what I am not doing. Client side we did the GUI.Java changed the 127.0 etc. Is there anything I have to do server side. I am using Combattscape as a source, for further information here is the download link I have created to share the info through my friend and it&#39;s the same .RAR file as the one I downloaded at the beginning.
