    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-wont-go-online/267709</link>
    <description>I have finnally finished coding my server, which took me about a month. I got No-ip, and it has an IP. I opened the port 43594. I logged in with the 0.0.0.0 IP and it worked. Then, I tried the Runelocus server status thingy, and it said offline? I also tried registsring on the serverstatus. Still nothing. Can you please help?
I did do portforwarding put it didnt work?
Any tuts?
I have a NETGEAR WGR614 v9 Router
