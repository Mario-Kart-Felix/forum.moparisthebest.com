[b]Small updates[/b]
Added a training area.
Lowered EXP rate.
Removed ::master
Added :: pure.

[B]Big updates[/B]
None yet!

[b]Information about release[/b]
The server is intended on being a complete pking server, more for pures but also for mains.

You will start out with the following items - Iron scimitar, short bow and 100 bronze arrows, 50k cash.

You can type :: pure and become a maxed 40 attack pure with 80 hitpoints, the exp per hit will be 120.
[B]
Cash will be made in these ways.[/B]

Thieving.
Killing dags for whips, berserker rings, archer rings, and seers rings.
KBD, will drop DFS, DFH, and furys.
Killing experiments (At the training area) these drop rune scimitars which can be sold to the general store for 250k
Killing bandits - While killing bandits you may be lucky enough to recieve rare drops, such as Whips, 1,000 rune arrows, and all dragon items.

Money will NOT be the most easy thing to obtain in this server, sorry if you don&#39;t like then you don&#39;t have to play upon release.

[B]The client[/B]
I am not the greatest client coder, it will be basic maybe bluurrs or maybe another client I can find that will work with the server, although I will be adding FULL prayer, such as Hawk eye, Eagle eye, piety, and chivalry.

[B]How am I going to obtain players?[/B]
Well, 5 days after my birthday the server is going to be in BETA testing, which means the server will have ::master and :: pure around 1 week after the beta testing the server should be fully released which means it will attract more players, I have a 1,000 person friends list on MSN, about 3/4 of them are from private server clans or just friends, I can get over 100 people to vote a day if I really do try but I don&#39;t like trying a lot because it seems I&#39;m the only one putting effort forth to make this server successful. Now really onto how I&#39;m going to get players, first thing I&#39;m going to send a few aMSG&#39;s on MSN and then on the mopar irc and swiftirc, after that I&#39;ll go post around on google, m0par serverstatus, and google. I&#39;ll attempt to obtain around 400-500 votes. The main things that will obtain players will be the PKing, the 5GB of ram dedi, the highscores and the staff positions will be open for the first 10-20 days of the server, meaning more people will attempt to get staff etc.
