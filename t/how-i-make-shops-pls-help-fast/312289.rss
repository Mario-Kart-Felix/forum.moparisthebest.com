              <p>Lol, this is exactly why server developtment doesn’t grow. Users like yourself have no thrive to learn nor take the time to go read guides made by more experienced users. People like yourself instead leach off someone else’s hardwork to gain credit. Punch yourself in the face</p>

              <p>Why would we go through the trouble to make a video on how to make a NPC tradeable when there are hundreds of guides and questions on this same topic. If your going to run a server you must learn how to search for answers on your own. Learn the how to use Google and Moparscapes search bar.</p>
<p>I’ll spoon feed you just a little bit, the problem your having has to do with your client.java. Use common sence only cause you made the NPC spawn and made a new shop it doesn’t mean it will magically combine to your likes. There has to be a way where all the codes will come together and function properly. You basically tried to peal an apple and only got the knife and apple now you must put the knife to the apple and peal it. Hope I opened up your eyes.</p>
