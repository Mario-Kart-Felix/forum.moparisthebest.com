    <description>[center][size=24pt][u]CYSTEMX[/u][/size]

Creating a New RSPS and looking for certain coders &amp; developers to help out.
The Servers&#39; name is: Cystemx

[u]What are you trying to Achieve?[/u]
I am trying to achieve a successfull 24/7 server which will be very fun to play with lots of mini-games, quests, friendly community and a good economy.

[u]Have you made any Servers before[/u]
I have made a good 7 or 8 RSPS&#39;, Some being quite successfull and others just being the dog&#39;s bollocks. I&#39;ve always had a dream to run a huge popular server, but I have just never had enough cash to provide for the advertising to draw in new players. But now I have a decent job with a Decent income which will be able to fund the server.

[u]What do you intend to happen in-game?[/u]
I have drawn out a little map of what I have maybe thought about, It&#39;s just bassically transforming the whole of Varrock Castle into a little Home area for all players, Mostly other area&#39;s around the map will be out of bounds and un-accessable for players. Here is a picture of what I have in mind roughly-

Here is just a picture of the Map:

AND here is a picture of my plans roughly (With a noob-friendly Key) :

[u]Who are you wanting to join your Development Team?[/u]
Well I am looking for a number of talented people with a number of skills;

[ul][li]Mature/Formal[/li]
[li]Alot of Experience[/li]
[li]Some decent Knowledge[/li]
[li]How to Code/Develop a Server &amp; Website[/li][/ul]


I know what I am asking for maybe a bit too much, but for those talented people who know alot on coding, I am offering a fair amount of cash; As you will be working for me and helping me out, So I am willing to pay some cash for the help I recieve.

I am also looking for Web Designers, Or who ever else knows what they&#39;re doing when it comes to website coding, I am hoping to have a Professional layout to the Website &amp; Forums. In the website&#39;s Navigation, I am looking for the following pages to be coded correctly;


[ul][li]Play now (Webclient)[/li]
[li]Forums[/li]
[li]HighScores[/li]
[li]IRC (Live Chat)[/li]
[li]Membership OR Donations[/li][/ul]


I am also looking to have the Server data connected to the website, So when you like Register your account on the Forums/Main site, It also then creates your account In-Game.

Also looking out for Client developers to help out with the Client.

I think the Server will be a 459, But if any of you suggest something better and with a good reason, I may go along with it. 
I am not looking for no Average coders, but more or less decent ones who know alot when it comes to coding as I know most of the basics due to previously-owned servers.

I hope ALL members can contribute to my DREAM of having a sucessfull server, And if you are interested in helping out, then give me a PM here, Reply to this thread, Or give me an e-mail; Cystemx@live.co.uk
And I shall get back to you A.S.A.P!

Thanks for taking the time to read this thread, Peace.[/center]</description>
