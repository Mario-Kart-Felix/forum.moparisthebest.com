    <title>Eggs being used in summoning</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eggs-being-used-in-summoning/163341</link>
    <description>If you&#39;ve ever been woodcutting you&#39;ve probably goten a Brids nest with an egg in them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;And now to that evolutionary conundrum: what came first, the chicken or the egg? In the case of Summoning, it was eggs that came before chickens, as Mod Mark explains: &quot;When we initially concepted the bird nests, they were designed to add some variety to Woodcutting, similar to getting gems in Mining. The main aim was to add the tree seeds, but we also wanted to add other aspects, like shiny jewellery that a magpie may have stolen, or even an egg that a bird may have laid. At that point - back in the concept phase of the Farming skill - we knew that these special eggs would need to be used as part of the Summoning skill. So, although the skill went through a variety of different designs and focuses, the decision to add eggs in the skill was actually made almost three years ago!”&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;When asked about his favourite Summoning NPC, Mod Wilson answers immediately. &quot;That&#39;s easy; my favourite familiar is the karamthulhu. It&#39;s just so amusing – this evil squid, in a fishbowl, [b]attacking your enemies[/b].&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>It’s not a bad idea. Summoning creatures will obviously either have a time limit, or will of course be much weaker than the average player. So I’m sure they wont be making monsters for summoning strong enough to solo any boss monster like the KQ. Plus, I think they might disallow summoning in most minigames and in the Fight Cave. Last but not least, I don’t think the combat specific creatures will be able to pick up item drops, if you were thinking in terms of AFK training, but there might be a special kind of summon that is similar to the tele-grab.</p>
