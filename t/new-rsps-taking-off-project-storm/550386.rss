    <description>[center][size=12pt]I&#39;d just like to add this before you read about us or try us out. We are a SUPER dedicated team, and our server is based on our players.
We want to give them what they want, we want to attract new people and players, and not just to our server.
We&#39;re progressively developing and releasing NEW features, and content into the community for everyone to experience, create ideas off of, and when this projects over, we&#39;ll be releasing it for people to use. We plan to grow, and become a large community and we&#39;re not going to stop for awhilee. We&#39;ve been working to the max to provide for everyone, and satisfy our players. Which we do. I hope to see you ingame, atleast giving us a try. I guarantee you won&#39;t be unsatisfied with our services, or production, and you&#39;ll love this server. But however if you ARE unsatisfied, please contact a admin+ and give a detailed explanation of why, and maybe how we could change that for you. :) Thank you everybody! And thanks for everyone&#39;s support, really makes us want to geek out even more to perfect this.[/size]
([u]Note;[/u] We do have a live support chat, for anyone who needs immediate assistance, there&#39;s someone there 24/7 to help.)

The advertisement graphic is really unappealing, way too large and ostentatious. Also, the English in the advertisement is extremely poor, if English isn’t your first language, have someone else who speaks it fluently proofread and revise it. These comments and suggestions don’t reflect the server itself, just telling you what items about the thread itself could use improvement.<br>

<p>Sorry, I was trying to rush to get this done while doing a few other things, I’ll recreate the advert.<br>
I agree with the imaging, etc. I didn’t make them, I only posted this thread. Thank you for the tips, It’s been awhile since I’ve been involved in a project. My apologies.[/quote]</p>
<p>This server is hands down fantastic. The owners are on daily, putting in tons of work!<br>
They just picked up a new developer who seems to be flawless with everything he’s doing.<br>
He’s added a bunch of new features into the game within a couple days already.<br>
He rewrote the client, fixed all lag, black screening, and it’s like flawless now.<br>
Earlier today the new developer Im2High announced they were rewriting the source, and recreating the forums.</p>
