    <title>Just got moparscape client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-got-moparscape-client/223409</link>
    <description>It has been a while since I have played moparscape, so please don&#39;t be rude or anything.


I downloaded Moparscape again after like 5 months and I cannot join even the default server, which is your own. I click start server first but it just says error connecting to server. It says Server Error: Unable to startup listener on 43594 - port already in use?



Do I need something?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 01, 2008, 03:31:03 pm[/size][hr]Nevermind, restarted client and works fine now.</description>
