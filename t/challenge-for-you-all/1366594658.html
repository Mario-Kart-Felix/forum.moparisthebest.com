What happens if you multiplied everything by a factor (eg. 2) and then divided later?</p>
<p>It would probably slow things down but they already have heaps of crap in the client.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Silver Lining, post:11, topic:136659”]One huge difference between our “hooks”, Ollie: my names aren’t totally misleading. Also, I disagree that the name “World” is wrong. A class containing the current “world” the player is on would be better named “ServerInfo”, to come up with a quick name.[quote author=Nerice link=topic=188190.msg1777815#msg1777815 date=1190639970]<br>
Umm, do I have to use BCEL? Haven’t looked at the client in a year probably though so need some definitions to detect stuff. But using just a bytebuffer and offsets into it is sooooo much faster than BCEL. Offsets are set when the data is needed, or once it detects an unknown offset. Pretty much no offsets are set unless it needs or has to be, unless one is discovered while getting some other needed data.</p>
<p>Also since in the class file the method instruction bytecodes are unsigned instead of signed, it uses the unsigned byte so it don’t have to convert them either, stuff like that and other small things of course means less time. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink1bce.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Promise you, it would blow your times away… While your still loading classes, I would be setting hooks.<br>

One huge difference between our “hooks”, Ollie: my names aren’t totally misleading. Also, I disagree that the name “World” is wrong. A class containing the current “world” the player is on would be better named “ServerInfo”, to come up with a quick name.[quote author=Nerice link=topic=188190.msg1777815#msg1777815 date=1190639970]<br>
Umm, do I have to use BCEL? Haven’t looked at the client in a year probably though so need some definitions to detect stuff. But using just a bytebuffer and offsets into it is sooooo much faster than BCEL. Offsets are set when the data is needed, or once it detects an unknown offset. Pretty much no offsets are set unless it needs or has to be, unless one is discovered while getting some other needed data.</p>
