    <title>Challenge for you all</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/challenge-for-you-all/136659</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got a challenge for everyone. A challenge that will make new updaters sexy, and most existing updaters sexier. My challenge? Hook everything I&#39;ve hooked in my most recent updater in your updaters, and apply the hooks [i]quickly[/i](optional)[i] and reliably.[/i] 99% of my updater&#39;s naming right now is from frank_ because of the beauty of his names.

Rules:
1. No &quot;preloading&quot; or running your transforms once before the timing begins.
2. You must load from runescape.jar. Your updating time must include the time it takes to load from the .jar, so basically no one using BCEL can beat my times.

Now for what you&#39;re hooking:
[code]public interface Animable extends PrimaryNodeSub{
    int getAnimableHeight();
}[/code][code]import java.nio.ByteBuffer;

public interface ByteBufferWrapper {
    ByteBuffer getByteBuffer();
}[/code][code]public interface ByteStream extends Node{
    byte[] getBytes();

    int getPosition();
}[/code][code]public interface GroundObject {
    int getUID();
}[/code]Yes, that&#39;s my naming on that one, and yes, I know it&#39;s shit.[code]public interface IntegerNode extends Node{
    int getValue();
}[/code][code]public interface Item extends Animable{
    int getItemID();

    int getStackSize();
}[/code][code]public interface Mobile extends Animable{
    int getLoopCycleStatus();

    int getHeight();

    int getTextCycleStatus();

    int[] getHitLoopCycleArray();

    int[] getHitBubbleArray();

    int[] getHitDamageArray();

    int getAnimation();

    int getX();

    int getY();
}[/code][code]public interface MutableString {
    byte[] getBytes();

    int getLength();

    boolean isEditable();
}[/code][code]public interface Node {
    Node getNextNode();

    Node getPreviousNode();

    long getNodeID();
}[/code][code]public interface PrimaryNodeSub extends Node{
    PrimaryNodeSub getNextNodeSub();

    PrimaryNodeSub getPreviousNodeSub();
}[/code]No, you may not remove my eyes for the naming on that one.[code]public interface RSException {
    Throwable getException();

    String getMessage();
}[/code][code]public interface StringNode extends Node{
    MutableString getValue();
}[/code][code]public interface Tile {
    GroundObject getObject1();
    GroundObject getObject2();
    GroundObject getObject3();
    GroundObject getObject4();
    GroundObject[] getDrawableModels();

    Tile getTileAbove();

    int getX();
    int getY();

    int getLevel();
    int getOriginalLevel();

    boolean isVisible(); 
}[/code][code]public interface World {
    int[] getSineArray();
    int[] getCosineArray();

    int getTileCountX();
    int getTileCountY();

    Tile[][][] getTiles();
    boolean[][] tileVisibilityArray();

    int getCameraX();
    int getCameraY();
    int getCameraZ();

    int getCameraTileX();
    int getCameraTileY();

    int getLowerTileVisibleX();
    int getLowerTileVisibleY();
    int getUpperTileVisibleX();
    int getUpperTileVisibleY();

    boolean hasClickedToWalk();

    int getLevels();
}[/code]Some of these hooks are unnecessary, some aren&#39;t. Several of them are strangely missing in all updater outputs I&#39;ve seen. I really don&#39;t care about being beaten. All I want to see, mainly, is updaters made better, so make a few hooks, mmmk? Also, my biggest goal in this is related to the camera: the getCameraZ fields I&#39;ve seen aren&#39;t even the same sort of thing as the getCameraX and getCameraY fields. Best of luck to whoever takes this challenge, you&#39;ll be better informed once you&#39;ve done this. Also, in case you&#39;re thinking &quot;this will be difficult&quot;, I&#39;ve made hooks for every single one of these in under two days of barely any work.</description>

What happens if you multiplied everything by a factor (eg. 2) and then divided later?</p>
<p>It would probably slow things down but they already have heaps of crap in the client.</p>

              <p>One huge difference between our “hooks”, Ollie: my names aren’t totally misleading. Also, I disagree that the name “World” is wrong. A class containing the current “world” the player is on would be better named “ServerInfo”, to come up with a quick name.[quote=“Nerice, post:4, topic:136659”]Umm, do I have to use BCEL? Haven’t looked at the client in a year probably though so need some definitions to detect stuff. But using just a bytebuffer and offsets into it is sooooo much faster than BCEL. Offsets are set when the data is needed, or once it detects an unknown offset. Pretty much no offsets are set unless it needs or has to be, unless one is discovered while getting some other needed data.</p>
<p>Also since in the class file the method instruction bytecodes are unsigned instead of signed, it uses the unsigned byte so it don’t have to convert them either, stuff like that and other small things of course means less time. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Promise you, it would blow your times away… While your still loading classes, I would be setting hooks.[/quote]Even though simplification is one of the biggest reasons for software? Sure, I could write a whole program in binary, but really, I have better things to do with my time.</p>

              <p>its not that “hard”, he has just named things differently, like my “WorldController” is his “World”, which is a incorrect name, as there is already a “World” class which stores the current world the user is on. but anywho we are not here to argue that,<br>
