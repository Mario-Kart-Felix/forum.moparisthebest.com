              <p>to make yourself a server owner, go to the character files and click on yours. there will be playerrights-0. do playerrights-3 for owner, 2 for admin, 1 for mod.</p>
<p>it says port is already in use because you are already running a port and a computer can only run one port at a time, so you have to figure out what is already using it. im thinking you have the moparscape client up and clicked “start server”. dont click start server, just open the client and runserver then type in ur username and stuff</p>

              <p>Ok, I’m not too sure of the other ones, but for making urself owner, go to where u put ur source file, open it up, and open up characters folder.  Then just find your name in there NOTE: It will only be in there if u have already logged in once on ur server.  Then open up ur character’s folder, find player rights = and change the number to 0 for regular, 1 for mod, 2 for admin, 3 for owner, and 4 for admin with no crown.  For example, it would look like: player rights = 3  That would be for u to be owner.  And you maybe need to find the tut on putting PATH and CLASSPATH for when u try to start up ur server.</p>
