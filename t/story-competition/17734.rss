    <description>Heres mine:
Fine, noone will answer, so I&#39;m making another story.

&quot;Ahh..Autumn,&quot; Skidd said with a deep breath, &quot;a good time to just chill outside before Winter comes.&quot;

&quot;Indeed.&quot; Robert clarified.

&quot;So...what do you wanna do?&quot; Skidd asked

&quot;I know, lets work on our Rust collection!That things getting pretty big!&quot; Robert exclaimed.

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Skidd said, walking to the rust collection with Robert.

[b]*rustles*[/b]

&quot;What was that?&quot; Skidd asked.

&quot;Probably just a squirrel or something, c&#39;mon.&quot; Robert assured.

Later at their &#39;rust collection&#39;...

[b]*rustles*[/b]

&quot;WTF WAS THAT!&quot; Skidd swore.

&quot;Skidd!&quot;Robert yelled.

&quot;Sorry, but whats with that noise?I keep hearing it.&quot; Skidd worried.

&quot;Stop being such a baby, Skidd, and kelp me carry this stuff to the rust collection.&quot; Robert exclaimed.

&quot;Rrgh.Its kinda heavy,&quot; *drops something* &quot;and bulky.&quot;

&quot;Hello gentlemen.&quot; A man said.

&quot;Who&#39;s he?and why does he have grass stains on his tux?&quot; Skidd whispered.

&quot;I dunno, its your house.&quot; Robert said.

&quot;Gentlemen?What are you whipering about?&quot; The man asked.

2.

&quot;Uh, nothing.Who are you?&quot; Robert asked.

&quot;Why, I&#39;m an assasinator.&quot; The main said bizzarily.

Right then, the boys dropped their rust and began SPRINTING towards the house, the man still back at the spot they dropped their stuff, grinning.

*dials 9-1-1...*

&quot;Hello?Police?Yes, we&#39;re on 3495 Maple Road Torrenstown. We&#39;ve just met this man..he said he&#39;s and assasinator.&quot; Said Skidd.

&quot;Alright, can you tell us where in your house he is?&quot; The lady asked.

The two boys glanced at eachother, then glanced outside.He wasnt there.

&quot;W-W-Why do you need to know where he is?&quot; Skidd asked.

&quot;To get to that part of the house quicker.&quot; She said.

&quot;Dam-er..I mean crap..we dont know.Can you please hurry u-*line breaks*

&quot;Ohhh...shit...&quot; Said Skidd

&quot;Ugh, this sucks&quot; Said Robert, not caring that Skidd swore.

[b]POW![/b] *Door breaks*

*The boys see the assasinator*

&quot;Fuck&quot; Said Robert
