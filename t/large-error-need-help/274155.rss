    <title>Large error need help</title>

    <description>Well, yesterday my server was fine, i was playing on it getting new players on and all that jaz. I turn off my computer for the night (put it in sleep mode), wake up this morning, turn it on and go to log in and it says &quot;error connecting to server&quot;. I look at the runserver, it says:

[code]Connection from 192.168.1.1:3675
Disconnecting bugged player null
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at stream.createFrame(stream.java:36)
        at client.closeInterface(client.java:8321)

        at process.run(process.java:23)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)
ClientHandler: Client null disconnected (192.168.1.1)[/code]


How could I go from fine to in trouble in no time at all? I tried restarting server and got the same thing. If anyone could help me I would greatly appreciate it.

EDIT: FIXED IT MYSELF, it was something to do with my playerhandler file, i replaced it with one of my backups and it works now.</description>
