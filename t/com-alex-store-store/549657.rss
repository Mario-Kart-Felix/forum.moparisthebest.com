    <description>Ok so let me start out with a tiny introduction because as anyone who can help me will notice, this is my first post.
My name is Mckaen.
I&#39;m 21 years old, 22 on March 2nd.
I&#39;ve done a little coding in the past with 317&#39;s, and by in the past i mean like 5 years ago or something like that.
I am very interested in java coding, not just putting up a server.
I do ofcourse wish to put up a server, but I want to be able to code it, not just have people tell me how to fix and then I copy and paste. That&#39;s just not my thing.
The source that I grabbed was actually a 718 spawn pk server. I plan to make it into an eco based server concentrated around both pvp and pvm.
All of this i wish to change up myself, although i will probably need some help from you along the way to point me in the correct direction.
This is the link to the source. - https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,660532.0.html

Now onto my problem I currently need help with. This may be a situation where you point me in the direction of the download or something else along those lines, idk or i probably wouldnt be asking.
I have made a todo list, and the item on it that I&#39;m currently trying to tackle is being able to pack and unpack item bonuses.
I have the item bonuses unpacker. Here is that code.
[spoiler]import java.io.IOException;

import com.rs.cache.Cache;
import com.rs.utils.ItemBonuses;
import com.rs.utils.Utils;

/**
 * @author Frosty Teh Snowman
 * 
 *         Unpacks the Item Bonuses that are packed into the bonuses.ib file.
 */
public class ItemBonusesUnpacker {

	public static final void main(String[] args) {
		log(&quot;Unpacker Started.&quot;);
		try {
			Cache.init();
			log(&quot;Cache Initiated.&quot;);
		} catch (IOException e) {
			log(&quot;Exception in initializing cache.&quot;);
		}
		ItemBonuses.init();
		log(&quot;Item BONUSES Initiated.&quot;);
		for (int itemId = 0; itemId &lt; Utils.getItemDefinitionsSize(); itemId++) {
			log(&quot;Getting Values for item &quot; + itemId);
			int[] bonuses = ItemBonuses.getItemBonuses(itemId);
			File file = new File(&quot;DATA/items/bonuses/&quot; + itemId + &quot;.txt&quot;);
			try {
				if (file.createNewFile()) {
					BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(
							file));
					writer.write(&quot;Attack BONUS&quot;);
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[0]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[1]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[2]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[3]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[4]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(&quot;Defense Bonus&quot;);
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[5]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[6]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[7]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[8]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[9]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[10]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(&quot;Damage Absorption&quot;);
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[11]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[12]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[13]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(&quot;Other Bonuses&quot;);
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[14]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[15]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[16]));
					writer.newLine();
					writer.write(Integer.toString(bonuses[17]));
					writer.flush();
					writer.close();
				}
			} catch (Exception e) {
			}
		}
		log(&quot;Finished Unpacking.&quot;);
	}

	private static void log(String s) {
		System.out.println(s);
	}

}[/spoiler]
Yes this was copied and pasted, clearly put out there for people that needed one.
Now the problem is that when i run the .bat file to unpack the .ib file using the unpcker -[spoiler]@echo off
title Bonuses Unpacker
&quot;C:/PROGRAM Files/Java/jre7/bin/java.exe&quot; -Xmx815m -cp bin.lib;/*; com.rs.tools.ItemBonusesUnpacker true true false
pause[/spoiler] - I come across this error - [spoiler]Exception in thread &quot;main java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/alex/store/Store
 at com.rs.cache.Cache.init(Cache.java:20)

Press any key to continue[/spoiler]

Now to me it seems like the source itself is missing something, which is strange seeing as how i can compile, run, play, change commands, deadtimes, etc.
Anyways if I&#39;m missing something the logical explanation would be to ask if anyone know what I&#39;m missing and can help me get it. 
And before you say anything yes, I have looked for it, but seeing as how i don&#39;t know exactly what im looking for I could be looking in the wrong places.

If anyone can help me I would greatly appreciate it.</description>

              <p>Sadly it isnt there, checked every dang folder in there for the .class the first time around.<br>
For some reason it didnt register to check for the .java, but now that i have, it isnt there either.<br>
Was kinda afraid i would have to download source after source til i found it.<br>
But its something I can’t really avoid seeing as how i need it to do any packing or unpacking.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help/extra insight.<br>
If any way around that comes to mind please let me know.</p>

<p>It’s looking for a file called Store.class that would be found in /bin/com/alex/store/Store.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t exist, well, that’s your problem…<br>
Check if Store.java exists in: /src/com/alex/store/Store<br>
And if it does, you need to compile the project and make sure that the store folder is included in the compile.<br>
If it doesn’t. Well, you need to rip it from another source.</p>
