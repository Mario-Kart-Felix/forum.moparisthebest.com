    <description>[font=Verdana][b]Okay you want to make a flint bomb? well its not a bomb but it looks cool (H)

First of all

Buy 2 Disposable lighters [or 1 if your friend has one, you only destroy one of them]


Second: Take the case off one of the lighters [the metal bit]



Third: Take the scrolly thing off that sparks, but put your hand under it because the flint with fall off and its quite small the size of this [+] maybe smaller


Forth: There is a spring holding the flint against the scroller :P pull that out


Fith: Push the flint in the top of the sping on the side of it so its fully in, this could take some time, but its worth it


Sixth: Borrow a friends lighter or your own if you have 2, and hold the end of the spring the flint isnt in then burn the flint


Seveneth: wait till the flint goes red and throw on the floor or at someone and it goes like a sparkler , if you threw this on the floor and it made a sparkler thing if you can see soemthing glowing still scuff your foot over it and it will do it again,throw it at soemone at your own risk

:D

Also a tip for when youve got a fucked up lighter pull the plastic bit off the top [use your teeth] and there is a circle shape tist it till you hear gas come out put your fringer over it shake it and light it then put the lighter upside down so the flame is at teh bottom and rest it on a wall stand back and it will expode

[This was my first tut btw. :P]

thanks

Bielby
