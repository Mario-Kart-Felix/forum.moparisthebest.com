    <description>[center][b]Creating your first flash game.[/b][/center]


[i]in this tutorial i will be showing you how to create your very own shooting game in flash. allso this could be a big lerning curve in action script for you like it was for me.[/i]
[b]Items Needed:[/b]
[i]Macromedia Flash (preferbly 8 )
A good Brain
and common sense[/i]

[b]StepOne.[/b]  [i]Draw your gun (or even just a square for your first one thats what i used) so now once you have drawn your gun we need to convert it to a movie clip so it will do your animation, so highlight all of your Gun that you will be using and press F8, this should pop up[/i]
[img]http://picup.weejewel.net/images/16434.jpg[/img]
[i]and do the following as it is in the image.[/i]
[b]StepTwo.[/b]  [i]Now we need to add the firing animation, so double click on your new movie clip you just created (your gun or object) and insert a keyframe into frame two and then click back onto frame one, now press F9 to enter the Actions Bit and type in the following [/i]
[code=actionscript]stop();[/code]
[i]this is so your gun will not keep firing once you have clicked your mouse. your timeline should look like this:[/i]
[img]http://picup.weejewel.net/images/34131.jpg[/img]
[i]now click on your frame2 and move your gun/object a little bit back and add fire around the top of your gun and put a bullet coming out of your gun.[/i] [u]do[/u] [b]not[/b] [u]insert your stop code here because it will make your gun not go back to frame one untill clicked again (thus making it look like it has crashed or badly made) now click on the back arrow next to your timeline[/u]. 
[img]http://picup.weejewel.net/images/36372.jpg[/img]
[i]now we have to make our gun fire when we click so to do this you need to click on your gun and change the propertys to these[/i]
[img]http://picup.weejewel.net/images/63268.jpg[/img]
[i]and then in the action bit add this code[/i]
[code=actionscript]onClipEvent (mouseDown) {
_root.gun.play();
 }[/code]
[i]now you gun will fire once you have pressed your mouse button down, so press CTRL + ENTER and test your gun[/i]


[center][b]time to make your crosshair[/b][/center]
[i]
Draw Your crosshair that you want to be used in your game. here is the one im using         [img]http://picup.weejewel.net/images/48549.gif[/img]
highlight your cross hair and press f8 and select Movie clip and rename it crosshair then click Ok.
Select your new movie clip (crosshair) and  press F9 and in the action script type this in:
[code=actionscript]onClipEvent (load) {
startDrag(&quot;&quot;, true);
Mouse.hide();
}[/code]
now Press CTRL + Enter and make sure that your cursor is used insted of your mouse, you gun/man/object fires when you click your mouse down.
[/i]

[center][b]now to add your enemys[/b][/center]

[i]lets make a simple circle for our enemy, so draw a circle in the top half of the page and press F8 and select these[/i]
[img]http://picup.weejewel.net/images/11719.gif[/img]
[i]now click, double click your target (circle) and then insert [/i][b]4[/b][i] new key frames and just like when earler in this tutorial add the[/i]
[code=actionscript]stop();[/code]
[i]script but insted of doing it to just the first one do it to all of them so that once your target (circle in this case )has been hit it dose not go through all the stages. now in the second keyframe make your target (circle) look like once it has been shot once, then in the third keyframe do the same and carry on untill you have used all the [b]4[/b] keyframes. now on your fifthed &lt;not sure if i spelt it right frame create a new key frame and insert this script by pressing F9[/i]
[code=actionscript]_root.circle._x=30;[/code]
[i]this means is it will respawn as the first object.
now click the back arrow [/i][img]http://picup.weejewel.net/images/36372.jpg[img][i]and then select your target (victim and press F9 and enter this action script[/i]
[code=actionscript]onClipEvent (enterFrame) {
if (this._x&lt;=500) {
 this._x += 10;
} else {
 this._x = 40;
}
}
on (press) {
this.play();
}[/code]
[i]now press CTRL + ENTER and test your new game[/i]

[center][b][size=12pt]Congratulations in making your new game[/size][/b][/center]
