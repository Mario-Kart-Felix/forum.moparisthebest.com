    <title>Does OSRS GWD influence the current situation of OSRS players&#39;population?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-osrs-gwd-influence-the-current-situation-of-osrs-playerspopulation/534627</link>
    <description>Since January, 2013, the population of osrs players has been counted and the statistics show that the old school runescpe has lost almost 50% of its population in 3 months. And many people presume that the old school runescape will die soon. However, to relieve the severe situation and make the game live longer, its developer fully takes players’ needs into first consideration and works hard by bringing back the popular God Wars Dungeon. Will this God Wars Dungeon increase population for old school runescape?

The average runescape 2007 users between October 5th and October 12th are fluctuated around 10,000. At 09:25:02 on October 12nd, 2013, there are 7,787 old school runescape players totally. From the above statistics, we cann’t be so optimistic about the future of old school runescape. We have no idea what will happen after Oct. 17th, 2013 – the release day of osrs God Wars Dungeon. （ARTICLE SOURCE:http://www.rsorder.com/profile/news/read/id/791）

The game wasn’t actually ruined until the armor visual update and SOF, that was what started the games fall[/quote]<br>
It looks like that we are currently going for time before Sof… and even better!<br>
End of this month they will bring out new slayer stuff and roof agility etc.<br>
I think it is right way.</p>

              <p>Had they actually worked to implement the very successful updates from later years into the game and assisted in removing bots quicker and didn’t make it 8 bucks, it would be way more popular. Let’s face it, the fact that players have to pay 8 dollars USD to play an already created game with very few good updates just made it not worth it. You could play a decent meh RSPS for free and have more fun.</p>

<p>Doesn’t make much sense, the only reasons I hate modern runescape are Solomons, SOF, the armor look, and EOC. I did start to get a bit mad when the loyalty program was introduced, because I knew where the game was headed. In fact, I was going to renew my membership the day before Solomons was released. I got over SOF and hoped that was the last RWT type thing Jagex would add. The day I went to the homepage to sign up I saw the Solomons news post.</p>

<p>On topic though. Like Spades mentioned, if they brought back all of our stuff and stats, the game would’ve been much more successful and enjoyable. It would’ve brought back even more veterans, and I would’ve continued to progress my account I worked so hard for. Not to mention, the economy wouldn’t have turned to absolute shit within 3 weeks.</p>

<p>What do you expect? For everything to be handed to you? That would have been unfair to give everybody those stats they had in EoC. That was the point of 2007 servers, to restart and play from how it felt in 2007. If they gave you your stats back, You wouldnt have the feel of being able to train, and start from scratch.</p>

<p>RS3 now. But, it’s like when you start to play a new game, you have to get used to the interfaces, controls, etc… Once you do, it becomes a lot easier and isn’t complicated.</p>

              <p>Since January, 2013, the population of osrs players has been counted and the statistics show that the old school runescpe has lost almost 50% of its population in 3 months. And many people presume that the old school runescape will die soon. However, to relieve the severe situation and make the game live longer, its developer fully takes players’ needs into first consideration and works hard by bringing back the popular God Wars Dungeon. Will this God Wars Dungeon increase population for old school runescape?</p>
<p>The average runescape 2007 users between October 5th and October 12th are fluctuated around 10,000. At 09:25:02 on October 12nd, 2013, there are 7,787 old school runescape players totally. From the above statistics, we cann’t be so optimistic about the future of old school runescape. We have no idea what will happen after Oct. 17th, 2013 – the release day of osrs God Wars Dungeon. （ARTICLE SOURCE:<a href="http://www.rsorder.com/profile/news/read/id/791%EF%BC%89" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rsorder.com/profile/news/read/id/791）</a></p>
