    <title>Parents and your future</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/parents-and-your-future/459262</link>
    <description>Hello MoparScape.

It&#39;s been a while since I posted a debate topic so I thought I&#39;d get on posting one. This topic has been on my mind for quite a while and I can&#39;t come to a conclusion. Should our parents have a say in how we live or lives and plan our futures?

For example, my dad wants me to go out to Afghanistan and work with him; however my mum hates the fact that my dad is out there and wants me to stay at uni and get my degrees before making any bigger life decisions.

When I first told my dad I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be going out there with him he had this massive argument with me about how I was his son and should do what he says.

So, what so you, moparians? Should parents have a say in our future or not?</description>

I am taking care of my dads house and she stopped by to pick me up and she said be ready in 8 minutes. Then my dad calls me asking to find something and mail it to him. I also have to care for the cats and that takes 15 minutes alone. I couldn’t find what my dad needed and my mom was complaining about being tired so I told her to go home. So for being nice and for that reason, I was kicked out of her house since I don’t “love” her.<br>

              <p>My parents have told me the same thing for years. “We want you to be more successful than we are” See, both of my parents never got their high-school diploma(s), but the thing is… they both have decent jobs. My dad works at the Toyota plant in Indiana and my mom does private duty. What that means is… she works with elderly people when the caregiver doesn’t want to put them in a nursing home. The person she is currently ‘taking care’ of is the founder of a the Messenger Inquirer, not that it has anything to with the subject at-hand.</p>
<p>I guess what i’m trying to say is, after you get a high-school Diploma your career should be up to you from there. There’s nothing wrong with your parents wanting you to go into a certain field, thinking it would be the best for you. When you turn 18, you’re considered an adult and should be wise enough to have your future planned.</p>
<p>When I graduate I plan on moving close to the penitentiary and working there as a Correction Officer. It’s not the best career but i’ve had my mind on it for quite sometime now, and I am certain that’s what I plan on doing until I retire. It’s something I want to do, and both my parents approve.</p>
<p>I hope this helped… somewhat.</p>

              <p>What Bowser said, this is a big problem in Egypt – you will often find people forced to study something they don’t like just because their parents want them to, or they’re forced to give up something they like (sports come to mind almost immediately). I think they should provide advice (they do have experience, after all) but they should also learn when they can’t completely control your life any more and when they should leave you make your own decisions.</p>

<p>I think the two should have a couple on our lives, not hold our “souls” if you will in their hands after we’re 18 or something. At that point, we are somewhat mature to make our own decisions. Obviously if we don’t want to do something, we’re not going to do it, and if we’re forced to do it, we’re not going to remain in the ‘field’ for long, now are we?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah I agree with that, but I think that after 16 we should really be loosened up on if you will, they shouldn’t be as rough and let us find our own way in the world. I mean, I realise they don’t want us to make the same mistakes as they have and what not but they don’t realise that we have to learn ourselves.</p>
<p>That’s just my opinion, though.</p>
