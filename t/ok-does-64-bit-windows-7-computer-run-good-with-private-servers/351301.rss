              <p>I had the same problem, but after searching youtube, i got the solution.</p>
<p>First, open the client files and find the program that runs the client, right click and edit it.</p>
<p>next find the word “java” and replace it with this(include the “”)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/Jre6/bin/java.exe"</code></pre>
<p>save it and run the client, this has fixed clients for me every time.</p>
<p>also, if you have a different jre version, just change the 6 in the code above to your version of jre</p>

              <p>I have windows 7 and it runs perfectly. You sure you have JDK? If you do edit your compiler and or runserver and make sure your version of JDK is there.<br>
Ex.<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_10\bin\javac.exe”</p>
<p>Say you downloaded update 21. change that 10 to 21.</p>

              <p>I’m not 100% sure, It could be the reason that the server isn’t 64bit compatible. again i’m just making a guess, I suggest you download soulsplits server, for the fact it has a “run in 64bit” option.</p>
