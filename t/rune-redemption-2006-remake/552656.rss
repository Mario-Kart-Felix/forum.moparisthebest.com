[FONT=Century Gothic][SIZE=5][COLOR=red]About Us[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

[FONT=Courier New]The Rune Redemption team strive for a complete, professional emulation of RuneScape as it was before May 2006. As a plan of action, we’ve made the decision to focus development on the Free to Play (“F2P”) aspect of the game first. Without leaving a stone unturned, and when we’re certain the F2P portion is finished in its entirety, we’ll then move on to the members portion of the game. We are determined to ensure every single aspect of the F2P facet is fully functional before continuing; by doing this, we’re automatically given a strict guideline and work ethic to progress on. We aim to set the foundational standards for a remake - with an eye for detail, diligence, communication, and efficiency Rune Redemption will be the RSPS-Remake landmark. 

As of now, we can inform you that we’ll certainly be having a rolling-development stage including a testing Alpha stage. We’ll need to use this as our main testing phase to accumulate as much information as possible regarding any current and possible bugs and issues that may arise in the future. Upon official release, players will be able to enjoy the rush of nostalgia as they play. Every single F2P detail will work by this time. Slowly but surely after this, we’ll be making available various member areas, items, and skills; they will be made available after testing has concluded they are completely or virtually without flaw. As to be expected, however, an issue may turn up over time - rest assured bugs will always be prioritized over content additions.

So where do we stand? Rune Redemption is a forked project from what was previously known as Scape-2006, the source itself has already been long into development. We’ll be keeping everyone updated on a regular basis so you can follow our progress as we near testing!
