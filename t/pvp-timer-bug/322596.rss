    <title>PvP timer bug!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pvp-timer-bug/322596</link>
    <description>- This topic is for the people who have actually fixed the bug, I appreciate suggestions however it will be a waste of time as I can guarentee I&#39;ve already tryed it - 


Basically this is a 317 Server which is Camelot PvP based (Delta).

The bug consists of the PvP timer, when you attack an NPC the PvP timer appears allowing you to attack other players in safe zones.

If you&#39;ve fixed it your know what I&#39;m talking about. The only person I&#39;m aware of that I know whos fixed it is Demise.</description>
