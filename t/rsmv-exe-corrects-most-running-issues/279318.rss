    <description>Alot of people get that 
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.land.NoClassDefFoundError: Main

thing... well this .exe i wrote will correct that, just put it in your rsmv file and run this... it will extract all current models from runescape...

NOTE: it doesnt compile it.. u will need to do that yourself and last time i checkd rs was at version 546...

You dont need to download if u dont need.... but here is a screeny of it

if u get any other errors just tell me and ill see what i can do... I had to personally write this one cause i use a laptop and RSMV doesnt like to work on them for some reason... heres the DL link btw:
