              <p>If you want the two people to really host the same server at the same time (Cluster) the thing can get quite complex so I won’t get into that. If you just want the two people to host the same server, at different times (so as to be able to have it always up), you basically have three options.</p>
<p>First one, and possibly the easiest one, would be to make a program that synchronizes both computer’s data folders (It would just need to be done just before one server is about to shut down).</p>
<p>Second one would be to modify the server to use a MySQL database instead of files, and to have the MySQL database hosted somewhere 24/7. That way both servers could access the same database. Note that if the server is not properly designed, and if the database is not in a local LAN to both servers, this approach might slow down the server.</p>
<p>Last one would be to use a MySQL database too, but to have different databases in each computer. You would have to synchronize them, as in the first case, but it could be somewhat more efficient (especially if there is a lot of data) because MySQL is more flexible and powerful than just binary data files.</p>
