    <title>The Correct Approach - Learning a Language</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-correct-approach-learning-a-language/454485</link>
    <description>Though I&#39;m apparently not as knowledgeable as [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,319308.msg2530319.html#msg2530319]this[/url] fellow who claims that he has been programming for 8 years, I&#39;ll try my best to contribute folks. Apologies. I&#39;ve seen plenty of communities that have failed to reinforce what the correct approach to learning a language is. Because of this, they have been forced to deal with a member base that requires constant and continuous spoonfeeding. When i say spoonfeeding, i refer to members expecting information to be thrown at them with very little work on their side of the fence. There&#39;s many negatives to spoonfeeding:

1. You miss out on vital problem-solving skills. You soon become very dependent on the community for help and you very rarely learn how to solve problems for yourself.

2. Your ability to find adequate resources lessens because they&#39;re handed to you on a silver platter.

3. Contribution decreases because the blind soon lead the blind, with no real &#39;outside the box&#39; projects being conducted. The original knowledge is just circles and decreases in quality each round that it makes.

[i][u]So instead of following the template of other communities that preach such bad habits, i offer you another method.[/u][/i]

[b]Read[/b]


Read like there&#39;s no tomorrow. I would be very surprised if you were to read one of the many 600-page books on a language and not have learned anything new by completion. Read your heart away. Start easy even, with the &#39;for dummies&#39; collection. Go to your local library and find every book on the subject that you can. Nobody ever said it was easy. It requires hard work and dedication. Most of all, interest. This later breeds passion, that feeling you gain from accomplishment.

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutori...ybigindex.html

[b]Write[/b]

Write, write, write. Write until your hands bleed and you&#39;re unable to pleasure yourself for a month. Write something simple, run it and see how it preforms. Everything you read is useless until you put it into practice. You will begin remembering what you&#39;ve read the day before and you will know many methods of attaining the same result. You will develop a style, learn design and increase your ability to problem solve. The key to problem solving after all, is knowing multiple ways of achieving the same result.

[b]Write.. again[/b]

You can attain your desired result, great. This doesn&#39;t mean you should put it in the back of the brain and move on to another chapter. No. Re-write the same thing, in a slightly different way. Observe the results. Analyze the benefits or it&#39;s shortcomings. You will eventually learn a bit of efficiency which is vital. This can become a little dull after a while, re-writing the same thing 3-4 times. Once again, i never promised it would be an easy path to walk along.

[b]Keep Notes[/b]

I&#39;m an addict with notes. I keep them for almost anything and those notes have saved me a lot of time. Note everything. Did you slip up with the last piece you wrote? Note why and how you fixed it. Found a great resource? Note it. Did you wish something was a little easier or was there a part where you struggled? Note it and then work on it.

Note keeping is also vital for client examination, in my belief.

[b]Help Yourself[/b]

Instead of asking how you would approach a problem, first try figuring it out for yourself. You will fail loads or reach a halfway point where you realize that it&#39;s just not going to work. That&#39;s fine, at least now you&#39;re aware of it. You should never ask for the aid of other members unless you&#39;ve tried fixing it yourself and show your work so far. It gains a lot of respect posting your source code. It shows you tried. There&#39;s no respect for the lazy.

[b]JavaDocs and Resources[/b]

They are your friend. They usually provide great examples and in-depth descriptions. They are your friend. Love them. Use them.

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/

Also remember that a lot of the problem you face, will have already been resolved by other people on their own little projects. Especially in the RS cheating scene. Google with correct searches. Use the forum&#39;s search feature. The internet has a wealth of information. Eventually you will become faster as separating the bullshit from the useful.

[b]Gain a Mentor[/b]

Know someone who rather knowledgeable? They are a great resource. Have them on an IM client and help each other and discuss ideas. The experience of others is a huge asset to have. Mentors can be found by seeing who contributes the most or even in certain IRC channels.

[b]Share and Credit[/b]

Share whatever you have managed to do, even if it is minor. Usually you will get a lot of harsh criticism, though there are some diamonds in the dirt. Eventually as you progress, you will see other members start to respect you a lot more and together you will start contributing information to the community. This is how a community progresses. The amount of times i have seen communities produce something great, from just a few starting words in a thread.

I&#39;m aware that this was largely Java based but it seems appropriate for it to be, considering what usually gets worked on in this particular community. Wish you all the best.</description>

“what’s the best way to learn?”.</p>
<p>I’ve covered this in my posts above. Its aimed at a certain user group.</p>

<p>After re-reading this guide, it’s still worse than your guide about getting women.</p>
<p>imo, you should be experienced in the field you write a guide about. ie: programming and women</p>

<p>You are aware I held the java cup, right?<br>
I have years of experience, fool. I’m not just talking about within this scene either. I’m not saying I’m absolutely amazing compared to the likes of PSB or semaphore. Nowhere near. However, I’ve managed to do a fair bit with my abilities.</p>
<p>As for women? I’ve taken Jorsa out one or two times now. Feel free to ask him how it went. I also seem to forget who you are? I tend to lose track of nobodies.</p>
<p>If you want to start another pointless debate, feel free to continue. Thought I believe I’ve covered these points repeatedly throughout this thread and my past posts.</p>

<p>It’s great you’re aspiring to receive the Java cup, it’s a big goal for you, but I believe you can do it with the help of some of the better programmers on this forum such as Davidi2 or Taharok. Sometimes it’s necessary to ask for help when you lack the skills, especially in programming.</p>
<p>ps: What does Jorsa look like? Can you post a picture of him?[/quote]</p>
<p>I hope you’re trolling. Aspiring? I had the cup until I was banned. Davidi a better programmer? He’s doing well and improving rapidly but no, not at all. As for Taharok, I haven’t bothered to look at anything he’s developed so I’ll withhold my opinion on that one.</p>
<p>You do know I’m tree, right? I’ve been around for longer than most here. I’m the egotistical cunt that pops up when you’re happy, just to destroy your soul. My past positions around the scene are countless (not that they count for much).</p>
<p>Though not widely recognised now, I was a fairly well known fellow around the joint. My contributions to certain projects (given, a fair lot were private) and my time mentoring numerous members, is a point of pride for me.</p>
<p>/ego rant</p>
<p>Yeah I’ll upload one later of Jorsa and I.</p>
