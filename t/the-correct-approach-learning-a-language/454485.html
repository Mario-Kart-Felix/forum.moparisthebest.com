Apologies. I’ve seen plenty of communities that have failed to reinforce what the correct approach to learning a language is. Because of this, they have been forced to deal with a member base that requires constant and continuous spoonfeeding. When i say spoonfeeding, i refer to members expecting information to be thrown at them with very little work on their side of the fence. There’s many negatives to spoonfeeding:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You miss out on vital problem-solving skills. You soon become very dependent on the community for help and you very rarely learn how to solve problems for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your ability to find adequate resources lessens because they’re handed to you on a silver platter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribution decreases because the blind soon lead the blind, with no real ‘outside the box’ projects being conducted. The original knowledge is just circles and decreases in quality each round that it makes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">So instead of following the template of other communities that preach such bad habits, i offer you another method.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Read</span></p>
<p>Read like there’s no tomorrow. I would be very surprised if you were to read one of the many 600-page books on a language and not have learned anything new by completion. Read your heart away. Start easy even, with the ‘for dummies’ collection. Go to your local library and find every book on the subject that you can. Nobody ever said it was easy. It requires hard work and dedication. Most of all, interest. This later breeds passion, that feeling you gain from accomplishment.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutori...ybigindex.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutori...ybigindex.html</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Write</span></p>
<p>Write, write, write. Write until your hands bleed and you’re unable to pleasure yourself for a month. Write something simple, run it and see how it preforms. Everything you read is useless until you put it into practice. You will begin remembering what you’ve read the day before and you will know many methods of attaining the same result. You will develop a style, learn design and increase your ability to problem solve. The key to problem solving after all, is knowing multiple ways of achieving the same result.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Write… again</span></p>
<p>You can attain your desired result, great. This doesn’t mean you should put it in the back of the brain and move on to another chapter. No. Re-write the same thing, in a slightly different way. Observe the results. Analyze the benefits or it’s shortcomings. You will eventually learn a bit of efficiency which is vital. This can become a little dull after a while, re-writing the same thing 3-4 times. Once again, i never promised it would be an easy path to walk along.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Keep Notes</span></p>
<p>I’m an addict with notes. I keep them for almost anything and those notes have saved me a lot of time. Note everything. Did you slip up with the last piece you wrote? Note why and how you fixed it. Found a great resource? Note it. Did you wish something was a little easier or was there a part where you struggled? Note it and then work on it.</p>
<p>Note keeping is also vital for client examination, in my belief.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Help Yourself</span></p>
<p>Instead of asking how you would approach a problem, first try figuring it out for yourself. You will fail loads or reach a halfway point where you realize that it’s just not going to work. That’s fine, at least now you’re aware of it. You should never ask for the aid of other members unless you’ve tried fixing it yourself and show your work so far. It gains a lot of respect posting your source code. It shows you tried. There’s no respect for the lazy.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">JavaDocs and Resources</span></p>
<p>They are your friend. They usually provide great examples and in-depth descriptions. They are your friend. Love them. Use them.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/</a></p>
<p>Also remember that a lot of the problem you face, will have already been resolved by other people on their own little projects. Especially in the RS cheating scene. Google with correct searches. Use the forum’s search feature. The internet has a wealth of information. Eventually you will become faster as separating the bullshit from the useful.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Gain a Mentor</span></p>
<p>Know someone who rather knowledgeable? They are a great resource. Have them on an IM client and help each other and discuss ideas. The experience of others is a huge asset to have. Mentors can be found by seeing who contributes the most or even in certain IRC channels.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Share and Credit</span></p>
<p>Share whatever you have managed to do, even if it is minor. Usually you will get a lot of harsh criticism, though there are some diamonds in the dirt. Eventually as you progress, you will see other members start to respect you a lot more and together you will start contributing information to the community. This is how a community progresses. The amount of times i have seen communities produce something great, from just a few starting words in a thread.</p>
<p>I’m aware that this was largely Java based but it seems appropriate for it to be, considering what usually gets worked on in this particular community. Wish you all the best.</p>

        <p>A discussion about Programming and not spoon-feeding people? What I’ve been saying all along? FOOLISH AND DANGEROUS THINKING IF YOU ASK ME.</p>
<p>Everything said is accurate from what I read. It also helps to write something multiple times and keep it in your head. This way at least you retain something.</p>

<p>Once again, your opinion means very little. Your contributions and shows of programming ability have been weak and i hardly consider you anyone important, or knowledgeable. Perhaps you should drop the ego and try learn a little from me. I’ve been around the block a few more times than yourself. My years spent programming, contributing and mentoring surpass yours by multiples. Why must you continue to follow me around and question my knowledge when it’s abundance has been proven so many times before?</p>
<blockquote>c) Extremely vague but with lots of filler to make it seem like a real tutorial</blockquote>
<p>Because this guide not only covers specific resources and methods of learning… it also covers the correct mind frame when approaching a language. If i was writing a technical piece on specific libraries for example, then examples and direct links would be provided. In this case, it’s not appropriate. Also note that this tutorial was intended to be applicable to most languages. I did stumble into the Java farm a few times but majority of the content can be applied to other languages.</p>
<blockquote>d) Common knowledge, again with filler or clever wording</blockquote>
<p>New members making threads asking how to start programming or what’s the best way to learn, are rather common actually. Even a fast Google search would tell you this. I forget where i read it but it’s one of the most common new-starter questions around. It’s not common knowledge for someone starting out. Guess what… a lot of these members are just starting out.</p>

<p>[hr]</p>
<p>The Correct Approach - Learning a Language<br>
By Davidi2</p>
<p>Read books about your language, they can be found in electronic form or at your local library. Even the ‘for dummies’ series works! If you want help or a definition or tutorial, google is your friend!</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutori...ybigindex.html" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutori...ybigindex.html</a></p>
<p>Write code. Yea, write code. I wont tell you where to start or what to write or how long to write or when to stop writing, just keep writing. Keep rewriting your code to get better results.</p>
<p>Keep notes on anything you want to remember.</p>
<p>Read javadocs and other resou- oh wait, I already said this as my first point.</p>
<p>Talk to knowledgeable people to help you learn the language.</p>
<p>Get feedback on your work from knowledgeable people as this can help you learn. Slightly related to my previous point, but who cares!<br>
[hr]</p>
<p>“Drop the ego and learn a little from me”, that’s so much irony/hypocrisy in the same sentence I don’t even know what to say. As for your experience, I’ve been programming for 8 years, so unless you’ve been programming since you were 4 your hyperbole about ‘multiples’ is moot.</p>
<p>And you completely missed my point about common knowledge. I was not saying people don’t want to know how to get started, but what you don’t understand is that what these people want ARE resources, not general ‘study habits’ that anyone that’s gone through grade school knows about. I’ve seen the threads many times, they want to know of a good book to read or a good program to start with, not someone telling them to go ‘read a book’ or ‘go write code’.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you can summarize. Any university textbook that students are able to summarize, must be incredibly useless… right? Great works of literature that have been summarized? Pointless? Excellent logic.</p>

        <p>Actually I was taught that to write good informative or persuasive writing your points should not be able to be summarized without quoting or restating your topic sentence. If you put too much filler people can tell and get bored. If you summarize a textbook you miss out on either important explanations or details, yours has neither. (With the exception maybe of different ways to IM mentors which I didn’t include, but that was your shortest point anyways)</p>

<p>Your ego is unjustified, mine is. That’s the difference.<br>
8 years? My god, what a waste of time that has been. You’ve clearly picked up very little. To be honest, I’m surprised that you’ve even been on this planet for more than 8. If you’ve been programming for 8 years, then why was this posted 4 years ago?</p>

<p>Actually, i like to read through past threads on the topic from multiple communities. The original posters were satisfied with both approaches.</p>

8 years? My god, what a waste of time that has been. You’ve clearly picked up very little. To be honest, I’m surprised that you’ve even been on this planet for more than 8. If you’ve been programming for 8 years, then why was this posted 4 years ago?</p>

You’re never going to get one over me. I’ll never respect you, no matter how many times you argue against me.<br>
[/quote]Since when was your ego justified? You’ve never posted anything to show otherwise. Unlike you, some of us accept our flaws and don’t insist on going back and editing all of our posts that make us look moronic, but I see you’ve missed a few:<br>

<p>What a joke.<br>
And yes, I started Java 4 years ago. I accept I wasn’t any good at it when I first joined, is that a problem?</p>
<p>[quote]Actually, i like to read through past threads on the topic from multiple communities. The original posters were satisfied with both approaches.[/quote] Yea, doesn’t mean they didn’t already know. They obviously already knew if they were asking for resources anyways.</p>

You’re never going to get one over me. I’ll never respect you, no matter how many times you argue against me.[/quote]Yeah ok, a matter of opinion. That’s fine with me :rolleyes: And I don’t want your respect, you don’t have mine, I’m just sick of your pointless tutorials you make to try and support your naturally egotistical nature.</p>

<p>None of those posts show a lack of knowledge in the field of programming? Sure, the grammar is terrible and i take a non-serious stand with my posts… so what? It was a more relaxed place back then.</p>
<p>That post alone i linked shows that you’re full of shit. According to you, there was 4 years of programming experience before you posted that. Highly unlikely. As for the rest, great. Don’t bother following me around then.</p>

<p>I’ve always enjoyed the politics of a community.[/quote]4 years of programming experience, ages 9-13. Is it really hard to think that I might not actually be that knowledgeable? I’m not saying I was even any good at programming during that time, most of it was visual basic games like guess a number and tic tac toe. Never really was a real programmer, I just had fun developing small games like that. I had never heard of Java, or ANY other programming language yet.</p>
