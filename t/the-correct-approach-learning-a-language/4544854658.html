I was not saying people don’t want to know how to get started, but what you don’t understand is that what these people want ARE resources, not general ‘study habits’ that anyone that’s gone through grade school knows about. I’ve seen the threads many times, they want to know of a good book to read or a good program to start with, not someone telling them to go ‘read a book’ or ‘go write code’.</p>

<p>Actually I was taught that to write good informative or persuasive writing your points should not be able to be summarized without quoting or restating your topic sentence.

And yes, I started Java 4 years ago. I accept I wasn’t any good at it when I first joined, is that a problem?</p>

</aside>
<p>None of those posts show a lack of knowledge in the field of programming? Sure, the grammar is terrible and i take a non-serious stand with my posts… so what? It was a more relaxed place back then.</p>
<p>That post alone i linked shows that you’re full of shit. According to you, there was 4 years of programming experience before you posted that. Highly unlikely. As for the rest, great. Don’t bother following me around then.</p>

<p>I’ve always enjoyed the politics of a community.<br>
[/quote]4 years of programming experience, ages 9-13. Is it really hard to think that I might not actually be that knowledgeable? I’m not saying I was even any good at programming during that time, most of it was visual basic games like guess a number and tic tac toe. Never really was a real programmer, I just had fun developing small games like that. I had never heard of Java, or ANY other programming language yet.[/quote]</p>
<p>In the above context, i was mentioning the years to highlight your inexperience. Not saying it’s the best measure but generally the two are linked. So when you said:</p>
<blockquote>As for your experience, I've been programming for 8 years</blockquote>
<p>Those four years hardly count towards credible experience. Sure there was some but hardly enough to compare it against my years. If that makes any sense to you at all. When i refer to my years, i only refer to those where i was contributing quality.</p>
<p>For a moderator, you sure seem to support flaming up a thread. Another fine example at your incompetent nature, arrogance and grudge-holding.</p>
<p>[quote=“Omer, post:1, topic:454577”]Davidi2 has some nice points …<br>
Tree, I appreciate the fact that you wrote a tutorial to help the community (as I’m sure others do), it’s just a pet peeve of mine that you seem to take such pride in being a veteran member. That’s excellent, but you act like it makes you superior to others.[/quote]</p>
<p>It does. Thanks for the input however.</p>

<p>Honestly I’m surprised that after having countless people (including some more veteran than yourself, which seems to be the only way to get through to you) tell you that you’re arrogant and haven’t earned any respect you continue to even argue things like this. Obvious case of clinical denial, poor guy. If I felt like pouring salt into the wound we could easily get a few more ‘veterans’ here. And you’re right, I’m not acting like a moderator in this thread. But it’s tree, the infamous power hungry arrogant ex-moderator still intent on earning his old badges back, and I couldn’t resist. But I’ll just lock the thread now as any good moderator would, because this is not a programming tutorial, and we have a sticky that serves a better purpose.</p>

<p>What, the contribution of a small beginner tutorial that the board didn’t have proves what? That year i was working in multiple development teams and released a few decent projects. I hardly see linking that thread going against what i said earlier? I contributed plenty of quality that year, as well as small tidbits like that. I would consider that year a credible year of worthy experience.</p>
<p>Also note the responses within that thread. It was a completely different place where contribution was coming from everywhere, no matter how small or large.</p>

        <p>There is no singular correct approach. There is a structured and unstructured approach. Structured typically follows an educational course on the material, which has its own pluses and minuses. Unstructured is obviously self-taught (again, with its own pluses and minuses). I would recommend neither over the other. I’ve gone through both and have my own preferences, but I won’t convince you to do one or the other.</p>
<p>I will say independence is particularly useful in this field, but so is cooperation.</p>

<p>It’s great you’re aspiring to receive the Java cup, it’s a big goal for you, but I believe you can do it with the help of some of the better programmers on this forum such as Davidi2 or Taharok. Sometimes it’s necessary to ask for help when you lack the skills, especially in programming.</p>
<p>ps: What does Jorsa look like? Can you post a picture of him?</p>

<p>You are aware I held the java cup, right?<br>
I have years of experience, fool. I’m not just talking about within this scene either. I’m not saying I’m absolutely amazing compared to the likes of PSB or semaphore. Nowhere near. However, I’ve managed to do a fair bit with my abilities.</p>
<p>As for women? I’ve taken Jorsa out one or two times now. Feel free to ask him how it went. I also seem to forget who you are? I tend to lose track of nobodies.</p>
<p>If you want to start another pointless debate, feel free to continue. Thought I believe I’ve covered these points repeatedly throughout this thread and my past posts.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s great you’re aspiring to receive the Java cup, it’s a big goal for you, but I believe you can do it with the help of some of the better programmers on this forum such as Davidi2 or Taharok. Sometimes it’s necessary to ask for help when you lack the skills, especially in programming.</p>
<p>ps: What does Jorsa look like? Can you post a picture of him?[/quote]</p>
<p>I hope you’re trolling. Aspiring? I had the cup until I was banned. Davidi a better programmer? He’s doing well and improving rapidly but no, not at all. As for Taharok, I haven’t bothered to look at anything he’s developed so I’ll withhold my opinion on that one.</p>
<p>You do know I’m tree, right? I’ve been around for longer than most here. I’m the egotistical cunt that pops up when you’re happy, just to destroy your soul. My past positions around the scene are countless (not that they count for much).</p>
<p>Though not widely recognised now, I was a fairly well known fellow around the joint. My contributions to certain projects (given, a fair lot were private) and my time mentoring numerous members, is a point of pride for me.</p>
<p>/ego rant</p>
<p>Yeah I’ll upload one later of Jorsa and I.</p>

Your thoughts are deluded if you think you're better than Davidi2, he's much more proficient at the language (Java) than you are.

Yes, your username is tree... Unless you're implying you've been hacked, I don't know what your point is. You act as if you're someone I should know and take note of. Haha. To be an egotistical cunt, you kinda have to have backup, something to be egotistical about, which you lack.

Yes, I did recognize you from your other silly thread aforementioned. That is why I smirk a bit when I see your name.

No thanks, I don't really wanna see you and him haha.

<p>No worries. I doubt your vacuous mind will ever allow you to succeed in programming. Your lack of intelligence is too much of an impedance to your learning.</p>
