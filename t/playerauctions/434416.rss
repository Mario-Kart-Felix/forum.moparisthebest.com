    <description>I&#39;m a bit confused :/. I&#39;m trying to sell my account on it and there customer service is crap. I&#39;ve had a lot of experiance with there customer service(when there actually online) like randomly get my account suspended, unsuspended etc, them being waaay late on payments so trust me I cannot bear using them again :L(I used to buy to sell through other methods agees ago).
So I want to sell my account on there but I&#39;m a bit confused, I think its a generalised game account layout thingy could someone explain what I&#39;m to do?
What it says[code]Please upload one screenshot of your game account management screen (which includes Name of the Account, Owner&#39;s Full name and Address, etc), and one currently valid photo I.D.

Please note, that if you submit photos of the account information page, and also a copy of your valid I.D., PlayerAuctions will deduct an additional fixed fee for verifying your account and listing it as a Prime Verified account for sale offer. See below for details:
For accounts with a value less than $50 the Verified account fee will be $1
For accounts with a value greater than $50 but less than $100, the Verified account fee will be $2
For all accounts with values greater than $100, the Verified account fee will equal 2% of the total account value, with a minimum fee of $5.
If you do not upload copies of the account management information page and a copy of a currently valid photo I.D., or if your submissions are rejected, then the difference from any discounted insurance options which the buyer purchases will be deducted from your overall disbursement.

<p>My dads an alcholic druggy that I never see O_o. I’d prefer using my own though since I am of legal age to sell things + my mum doesn’t let me sell things on her account due to her knowing I’ve been charged back over a total of $1k usd. I don’t really understand what its asking me though. Okay, ID = can I use birth certificate.<br>
This page on rs for details, I’ve never heard of it…</p>
