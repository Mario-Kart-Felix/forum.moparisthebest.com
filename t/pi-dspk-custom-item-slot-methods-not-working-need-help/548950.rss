    <title>[PI/DSPK]Custom Item Slot Methods Not Working, Need Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-dspk-custom-item-slot-methods-not-working-need-help/548950</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve been working on this for about 6 hours now trying to figure out why I cannot get my newly added custom items to show in the right item equip spot. Previously about a year ago, when adding Items I would add them to the itemType string within itemAssistant.java using a code as such:
[code]if (item == 20100) {
return &quot;shield&quot;;
}[/code]
After doing that, it still did not work. Afterward I then deleted that code and tried to use the wearItem boolean within itemAssistant.java using a code as such:
[code]
} else if(wearID == 20100) {
targetSlot=5;
[/code]
Afterward, this still did not work and the item was still being wielded to the weapon slot. 

Seeing that itemAssistant.java was not working for me, I then deleted my code and moved to item.java.
After adding the correct names into item.java, the item still was not equipting to the right slot...I even tried adding the full item name in, just to see if it would do anything and it did not. 
I&#39;m planning on hosting this server sometime in the future, so it would be highly appreciated if I could receive some, if any help. I am using a cleaned [DSPK/PI] release to code, almost making it like trisidia, insidia, or even erasedpkz. Please help&lt;3 Noob in trouble here!</description>

              <p>Project Insanity handles items really shitty…<br>
You should consider finding an alternate way to handle them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure the item is in your items.cfg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure part of, or all of, the item name is in the proper array… Ex a full hat goes in the fullhelm array, boots in the boots array, and so forth. They should be in like Item.java.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>only if that doesn’t work should you be trying to ‘hard code’ (Step 1/2 is still hardcoding…) the items like you are.</p>
</li>
</ol>
