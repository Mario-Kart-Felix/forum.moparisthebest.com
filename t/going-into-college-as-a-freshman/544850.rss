    <title>Going into college as a freshman</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/going-into-college-as-a-freshman/544850</link>
    <description>I starting college this coming up fall, so I figured I would start a discussion about college courses in general, and maybe I could get a few pointers here and there. Anyway, before I actually start rambling on, take a look at my current schedule for my freshman semester:

[ul][li]Principles of Chemistry I - CHEM 1211K - F (MWF and labs on T)[/li]
	[li]English Comp I - ENGL 1101 - E3 (MWF)[/li]
	[li]American History II - HIST 2112 - B (MWF)[/li]
	[li]College Algebra - MATH 1111 - H (MWF)[/li]
	[li]Health &amp; Wellness for Living - PHED 1001 - C (MWF)[/li][/ul]

So far, the schedule seems pretty flexible (first class starts at 8:00 am, and the last one ends at 1:50 pm), which gives me a lot of time to do studying, work, hobbies or anything like that later on in the day. This being my first year, I&#39;m not really sure what to expect as far as difficulty and such, so I was wondering if any current student attention college would be willing to give some general advice, or whatever you think might be helpful for me to know.</description>

<p>Does anyone have tips for freshmen going into college?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you aren’t willing to do anything else, just go to class. If you actually pay attention and participate, your grades are going to be better than the kid who sits in the back of class, skips multiple days, and doesn’t participate. I’ve gotten A’s on papers simply because I participated in class and the teacher liked me.</p>
<p>Also, networking CAN be a load of shit when it comes to peers. I went through my entire undergrad without talking to one person outside of my fiancé and my teachers. It’s not your friends who will be writing your recommendation letters, it’s going to be your teachers. Find a good professor that is tenured and has credibility and take them for 2 or more classes. Doing things like going to their office hours to ask a stupid ass question even if you know the answer, will make them remember your name. Pair that with class participation and you won’t have an issue getting those recommendation letters.</p>
<p>TRY to make at least one friend in your classes that is reliable and goes to class. If you miss class then you at least have a chance to not miss notes or important notifications the teacher has mentioned that day. And don’t be a douche bag and just start relying on that person so you can skip classes, I’ve had people do that to me and I’ve stopped helping them.</p>
<p>And finally, don’t see your bachelors as the dictator of your career. Over the next 4 years you may be interested in something similar to what you majored in. If you can switch majors and graduate in a reasonable amount of time, then do not hesitate. If you do end up with a degree that isn’t exactly what you wanted, chances are if you worked hard enough and received a high enough GPA and didn’t dick around, you can apply for a Masters in what you really want to do. I got my bachelors in Sociology because I didn’t know what I wanted to do until my junior year, but I had a decent GPA (3.45) and I managed to get accepted into a social work program for my masters.</p>
<p>TL;DR? Actually do shit in college and don’t dick around. Yes it is important to have fun, but take it seriously.</p>

<p>I had to take a “YearOne” class that if you missed more than 2 classes, you failed it and you’d have to retake it. You also had to go to on-campus events (which unfortunately for me I live off-campus with family).<br>
Thankfully I only missed one class and didn’t have to retake it.<br>
Then there was First Year Writing, which I dropped the first semester and picked back up the second.</p>

<p>I really wish I had had a bit of guidance before starting last year. (Guidance I could take seriously)<br>

<p>This is probably the most valuable advice I didn’t follow. The “don’t be a recluse” thing was hard since I wasn’t living on-campus, but I managed to join a startup on campus and I’m no longer a recluse!</p>

Study externally man. Free’s up every hour of the day, it’s amazing. I work the equivalent of 2 full time jobs, and still have time to study Electrical Engineering and Computer Science full time. The only trade of is I have no social life, it’s work-&gt;study-&gt;sleep<br>

<p>This is horrible. Networking should be a priority in college. Not saying you should just blow money and fail classes but making friends, even in other fields, will go a long way in the future.[/quote]<br>
Horrible according to whom? You?</p>
<p>If you weren’t working I wouldn’t suggest it, sure… but my job kinda makes on-campus study not possible, given I cannot commit to attend scheduled lectures/etc during the week, and usually am not even in the state of the university most of the week</p>

              <p>Oh gosh O_O who does 3 session courses!??? I couldn’t stand doing those. I’d rather do 3 hour courses than that. And Casey is right, Friday courses suck. What I did was take MW or TR classes and kept my friday free. There is seriously nothing like a 3 day weekend when you’re in college. With a whole free day you can focus on gaming, hanging out, or simply finishing all that homework before your weekend truly starts.</p>
<p>As far as difficulty goes, it depends on what type of school you go to. I went to a state university and was easy. Shoot, I’m in a Masters program and it’s still easy. Most important thing to do is give yourself enough time to get your shit done so you don’t get stressed. Also, find out your studying habits. If you never studied in high school, you better figure out the best way for you to study real quick. For me it was flash cards. I am tactile and memory focused. Try to create associations in your head about what is related to what. An example of this was the ICD9 code for Anxiety is 300.2 in the movie 300 they were forced to fight off an entire army, so they must have been anxious. And you know what? That actually stuck with me and I remembered it on the test.</p>
<p>In short, save your Fridays, prepare for the worst and hope for the best, don’t slack or you’ll regret it, and figure out how you can best study. Oh, and don’t be afraid to use school’s services. Using the writing center or the math center is going to get you a much better grade than struggling for hours trying to get shit done.</p>
