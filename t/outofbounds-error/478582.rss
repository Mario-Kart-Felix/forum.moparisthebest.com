    <title>OutOfBounds Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/outofbounds-error/478582</link>
    <description>Ok, so I was on my server doing a stress test and every time I&#39;d do a stress test I would get an out of bounds error... Specifically java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 11824. 

It&#39;s never done this before, but I was logging in my bots 250 at 300ms. So I don&#39;t know if I was just logging them in too fast or what... Anyway, if anyone knows what could help me, that would be great! Thanks!</description>
