    <title>Wpe pro. a wow hack , would it work for runescape aswell?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wpe-pro-a-wow-hack-would-it-work-for-runescape-aswell/31177</link>
    <description>well as im sure many of you are aware there is a hack for world of warcraft using the program &quot;wpe pro&quot; this let you use spells that you hadnt learnt and stuff like that. Now , this doesnt work on wow any more because blizzard got pissed off and now they have pretty heavy security, however , does rs have that kind of anti-hack security? im pretty sure it doesnt. Now i tried this out and i managed to edit a few random things for example when i ate a kebab (on real rs this is btw) it would say OMG ITS A KEBAB, rather than : that was a good kebab, you feel alot better. However i didnt manage to change any big important things. There was one thing though. I managed to edit the stats that it showed when i clicked &quot;view stats&quot; now I couldnt find the correct code for the strength stat but im pretty sure that it is out there and well, here is a link to a tut on using wpe pro for world of warcraft. :

[url=http://www.hsforum.net/index.php?showtopic=5190]http://www.hsforum.net/index.php?showtopic=5190[/url]

Please can one of the decent coders out there look into this? or if its been tried and failed before please notify me. 

Thanks, Dr J</description>

<p>Private Servers != Real Servers<br>
Private Servers are coded by us (non-Jaguarex) members. We can make 'em do whatever we want. JaguarSex made em with 100’s of less glitches. Remember, don’t believe the MoparScape nebs</p>

<p>Actually, WPE is not a memory editor, it’s a packet sniffer. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>If you (jekkyl) are really serious about being able to do spells that you’re not supposed to be able to do, in WoW,<br>
then Blizzard doesn’t know shit about coding a secure server, unlike Jagex.</p>
