    <title>Help me with this idea i have</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-with-this-idea-i-have/7811</link>
    <description>*1.* Ok, so i have this idea, to make a mod only area on my server, the only trouble is where it is located, there is a gate, and i wanted to know if there was a way that i could put something infront of the gate (ex: stool/table/statue), or even just make it so that the gates won&#39;t open, if somebody could tell me on this thread how to do so it would be appreciated...(there is a tele for mods only to the area)

*2.* I need to know how to change the lvl of an npc, and its hp lvl. My idea is having a kbd around the lvl of 1800, with like 900 health, something that would be challenging. I have the kbd place, and the tele done, and i am currnetly working on a decently themed area with scared civilians and food shops...

If you answer those i would appreciate it alot!!!</description>

              <p>ok well the health and lvl thing is an easy thing 2 do what u do is u open up your npc.cfg file and u look for hte monsters name that u want and next to it will b 2 lots of numbers the 1st 1 is its lvl and the second one is its hp. as for the mod only area what i think u should do is add a command/check or something into client.java that makes it so that only mods can open that gate or it just teles them over it and leaves it closed</p>
