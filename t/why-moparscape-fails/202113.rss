    <description>[b]HANDLERS[/b] - this term is by far one of the most idiotic things i have witnessed in my years here. Please for the love of god stop making static classes and adding a call to that method in your &quot;process()&quot; method, you are solving Nothing.

[b]CLIENT.JAVA[/b] - this term is used as if its a object, its nothing more than a name please stop asking for other peoples &quot;client.java&quot; this also goes for any class name such as &quot;class8.java&quot; &quot;class9.java&quot; and so on.  9/10 it will not work for you because everyone programs differently.

[b]Server Restarters[/b] - fucking fail nothing more.

[b]ANY SERVER THAT IS NOT USING RS2Dv OR SOMETHING ORIGINAL [/b] EVERY BASE BEFORE RS2Dv should be deleted.

[b]ANY QUESTIONS SILAB CLIENT RELATED[/b]  SilabClient is made of fail i suggest using your own works.


[b]Any tutorials in the tutorial section [/b]  If they do not teach something worthwhile disregard it. if they are &quot;source specific&quot; they are made of fail. A tutorial should only teach a way you could implement something, Not hold your hand and tell you &quot;the only way&quot; it should be done.

[b]FREESMF[/b] NEED I SAY MORE!
MORE FAIL TO COME WHEN I FEEL LIKE RANTING AGAIN!</description>
