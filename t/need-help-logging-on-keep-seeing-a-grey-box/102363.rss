    <description>heya...need help logging on?a grey box keep popping up
thats easy to over come
and quiet simple aswell =D
all you have to do is download the latest version of java by going to :
www.java.com
when you get there download java,and there should also be a link for jdk 6.0
(which is needed to play game and make a server)so make sure you have it.


does it keep saying 
&quot;error connecting to server,must be down&quot;?
thats easy to overcome to,just because a server may appear to be on the online
server list,that doesnt mean it has to be online
it is down if you cant log back on,
so if that does happen that means the server is offline 
so just go and type in another server and hope it works
this isnt because of ure comp
its really the servers fault ;)</description>
