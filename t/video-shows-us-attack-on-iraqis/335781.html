        <blockquote>One of the internet's biggest sources of classified government information has released video of what it says is a US helicopter firing at civilians in Iraq.
<p>WikiLeaks, a website that publishes anonymously sourced documents,]released what it called previously unseen footage on MondayIt said the footage filmed from a helicopter cockpit shows a missile strike and shooting on a crowded square in a Baghdad neighbourhood in July 2007.</p>
<p>The website said 12 civilians were killed in the attack, including two journalists, Namir Nour El Deen and Saeed Chmagh, who worked for the Reuters news agency.The two men appear to survive the first strike and attempt to get away, but the helicopter returns a second and third time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>5th April 2010 10:44 EST WikiLeaks has released a classified US military video depicting the indiscriminate slaying of over a dozen people in the Iraqi suburb of New Baghdad -- including two Reuters news staff.
<p>Reuters has been trying to obtain the video through the Freedom of Information Act, without success since the time of the attack. The video, shot from an Apache helicopter gun-site, clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers. Two young children involved in the rescue were also seriously wounded.</p>
<p>The military did not reveal how the Reuters staff were killed, and stated that they did not know how the children were injured.</p>
<p>After demands by Reuters, the incident was investigated and the U.S. military concluded that the actions of the soldiers were in accordance with the law of armed conflict and its own “Rules of Engagement”.</p>
<p>Consequently, WikiLeaks has released the classified Rules of Engagement for 2006, 2007 and 2008, revealing these rules before, during, and after the killings.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks has released both the original 38 minutes video and a shorter version with an initial analysis. Subtitles have been added to both versions from the radio transmissions.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks obtained this video as well as supporting documents from a number of military whistleblowers. WikiLeaks goes to great lengths to verify the authenticity of the information it receives. We have analyzed the information about this incident from a variety of source material. We have spoken to witnesses and journalists directly involved in the incident.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks wants to ensure that all the leaked information it receives gets the attention it deserves. In this particular case, some of the people killed were journalists that were simply doing their jobs: putting their lives at risk in order to report on war. Iraq is a very dangerous place for journalists: from 2003- 2009, 139 journalists were killed while doing their work.[/qoute]</p>

        <p>I think it’s easy to forget that hindsight isn’t one of the virtues afforded to soldiers in combat.<br>
Their lives, and the lives of their fellow soldiers, depend on them thinking about right now.<br>
For the record, I don’t doubt for a second that a shoulder-mounted camera could quite possibly be seen as an RPG.</p>
<p>As for the disparaging remarks that were made, soldiers have a tendency to mentally dehumanise their enemies to minimise the mental anguish attached to killing another human being. The psychology of killing is quite complex, but the majority of people don’t really want to kill another human, so they do their best to see them as subhuman.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that what they did was right. I’m not going to say it was wrong though, either.<br>
The unfortunate thing about war is that there often are unintended consequences, this being one of them.</p>

        <p>The attackers talk about seeing AK-47’s. There are 2 things that bother me about that.</p>
<p>First off, I don’t see anything that resembles a weapon. You could argue that the camera looks like an RPG, but if you look at the global picture, you’ll understand that a group of about 12 people doesn’t walk around with only 1 ‘RPG’ (and no extra weapons), unless it <span class="bbcode-b">isn’t</span> an RPG.</p>
<p>Secondly, and this is what surprises me the most, they see AK-47’s. They don’t see weapons, they don’t see armed men, they see men with AK-47’s. I think these men either have seen to much fights and automatically see men as terrorists, or they are racist idiots who shouldn’t be there in the first place.</p>
<p>I guess Lothy is right when he says that soldiers dehumanize the enemy to stay mentally stable. It’s painful when this becomes public, though.</p>
<p>But the whole idea of ‘when in doubt, fire’ which can be seen here and other events is just stupid. Lothy says soldiers depend on other soldiers, and Apache crew in particular. But do you trust them, now that you’ve seen this? What if you were a journalist in Iraq? You’d expect them think twice before firing, but obviously they didn’t.</p>

        <p>This video is a bunch of bullshit. There is not information on the events leading up to this happening. Also, there saying that the soldiers didn’t know that the children were there, obviously they fucking didn’t. When your circling around an area in realtime your not going to notice that two little heads in the front seat were a two children, your only going to notice they were children when you go back and are specifically looking through the video trying to find them; and the stupid fucking parents brought them into that shit. Also to R.I.P what other types of weapons do you see terroists walking around with?</p>

<p>We aren’t over there just killing civilians for no reason, war doesn’t work like that. Australia and Britain would definitely not be on our side fighting there right now if this was the case.</p>

06:18:40   Crazyhorse [lead helicopter] notices a group of people on an open plaza.

06:26:29   Bushmaster gives permission to engage. Proceed to open fire on the mini-van</blockquote>
<p>They got killed because they were standing in a group.<br>
“Crazyhorse” lied about seeing weapons (or he wanted to to kill so bad, he saw what he wanted to see.), he even claims they are shooting at him.</p>

        <p>If crazyhorse did lie, and it is found out about he is flown back to the country and put in jail for life.</p>
<p>But accidents do happen, even though this was one person’s fault and it wasn’t really an accident to him. The pilot wasn’t out looking for civilians to kill, nor were they ordered to. There is no perfect military system that never kills civilians. But its another thing to say we are over there CONSTANTLY terrorizing and bombing civilians, when there have probably been 10x as many confirmed enemies killed.</p>
<p>I don’t know what all this bullshit is about not seeing any weapons. When they walk on the youtube video you can clearly see thin rod looking things swinging in their hands. This may not be noticeable when they were all standing in a group because the guns would have been beside their legs and it can blend with he black and white image.<br>

<p>In the second image, who the fuck would hide behind a wall crouched with a camera like that?</p>
<p>CrazyHorse did sound very eager to shoot them though, and he sounds like he has some problems@“look at the dead bastards”</p>

It’s mostly non-civilian buildings. Other than that they sometimes target government structures which belong to the American puppet government. You don’t see them blowing up civilian houses or attacking large groups of civilians like this.</p>
