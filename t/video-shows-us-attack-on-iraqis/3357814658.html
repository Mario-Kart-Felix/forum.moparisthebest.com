        <p>For the record, shoot first ask questions later is more appropriate in war than some of you would think. ‘Better him than me’ comes to mind, and after seeing the still image provided by Frell I have no reason to believe that Crazyhorse was in the wrong by engaging them.<br>
And I’ve already pointed out the reasoning for the disparaging remarks.</p>
<p>If I was over there and placed in the same situation, I’d probably react in the same manner. Loyalty to my unit is far more important than potentially losing somebody at the expense of letting a potential insurgent live.</p>

<p>In the first article, suicide bombers were trying to kill the survivors of an earlier attack. In the second article, Shiite pilgrims were targeted as part of the sectarian war which the Americans ignited. Those pilgrims were most probably coming from Iran.</p>

<p>What about that? They bombed a police station during the elections, they obviously didn’t want someone in office and would do anything to try to screw the election up.</p>
<p>Even then, it shows that the terrorists show no regret to killing civilians and will keep bombing and killing until hey get what they want.</p>

<p>Yes, you don’t see the americans dressed as civilans wearing bombs under their jackets and blowing up buildings, killing innocent people of their own country. So it is a terroist attack.</p>

<p>What about that? They bombed a police station during the elections, they obviously didn’t want someone in office and would do anything to try to screw the election up.</p>
<p>Even then, it shows that the terrorists show no regret to killing civilians and will keep bombing and killing until hey get what they want.[/quote]<br>
As I said, they do target the American established government’s structures. Any Iraqi knows that the resistance has declared that any association with the government which has been set up by the Americans is illegal. This is a war we’re talking about, as soon as any iraqi joins the police or iraqi army, they automatically declare war on the resistance.</p>
<p>I’m not saying whether they’re right or wrong (the blasts that have been happening in Baghdad). I’m just saying you need to understand how complex the situation is right now in Iraq. Thanks to the American invasion, Iraq consists of several different warring factions whose conflicts result in countless civilian deaths. Just to name a few of the main factions:</p>
<ul>
<li>American-established Iraqi army, police and other government forces</li>
<li>Islamic state of iraq (aka alqaeda in iraq)</li>
<li>Other sunni factions like the islamic army of iraq (Roughly there are upto 15 different factions?)</li>
<li>Jaish al mahdi and other Shiite factions</li>
<li>Kurdish factions like the peshmerga</li>
<li>America</li>
<li>Baathists (Saddam loyalists)</li>
</ul>
<p>These factions are at war with each other and this is the reason for all of the conflict in Iraq. These factions were formed as a direct result of the American invasion and it’s the conflicts between them that result  in the death of innocent civilians. However unlike America, none of these factions have the weapons technology to precisely hit their targets as they please, that’s why a lot of civilians are dieing.</p>

They aren’t ever portrayed as doing it for the ‘fun’ of it, theres obviously a motive but what they do to get what they want is a little drastic, but you’ve already explained the lack of technology.</p>
<p>But bombings and crimes like this have happened in Iraq before we invaded. They say it was the terrorist groups wanting control of middle eastern countries, and when we invaded we stood in their way of getting that control, especially when we helped them hold heavily secured elections. When we try to put someone in office to help iraq get back on its feet, they end up being murdered very soon after. Im sure a ‘resistance’ didn’t form the second we got there, they didn’t come out of nowhere and bomb Humvee’s to get their points across, and if anything thats going to make us stay to get the countries under control.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:22, topic:335781”]For the record, shoot first ask questions later is more appropriate in war than some of you would think. ‘Better him than me’ comes to mind, and after seeing the still image provided by Frell I have no reason to believe that Crazyhorse was in the wrong by engaging them.<br>
And I’ve already pointed out the reasoning for the disparaging remarks.</p>
<p>If I was over there and placed in the same situation, I’d probably react in the same manner. Loyalty to my unit is far more important than potentially losing somebody at the expense of letting a potential insurgent live.</p>

<p>Well I’m not exactly sure how they’re portrayed, but most Americans which I’ve heard from are misinformed. Have a look at videos of American bombs being dropped on youtube, and you’ll notice in the comments that people think the war in Iraq is some sort of retaliation for 9/11. It just makes Americans look retarded.</p>

<p>1)Are you serious? Iraq was as stable as it had ever been before the invasion. George W. Bush himself would agree.</p>
<p>2)Most of the factions didn’t even exist before the invasion. They were formed as a result of the invasion and therefore America’s presence in Iraq only ever helped other factions to take control of it.</p>
<p>3)Secure elections? That’s not right at all. With all the suicide trucks roaming around and rockets landing in the green zone, it would be unrealistic to call the elections secure. Voting in Iraq is probably more dangerous than robbing a bank in New York.</p>
<p>4)This never happened, what on earth are you talking about?</p>
<p>5)LOL when exactly do you think the resistance formed?</p>
<p>Your second paragraph was very poorly structured that I had no choice but to respond in this manner.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, is it me or does Frell seem to be making stuff up?</p>
<p>Oh and no harsh feelings towards Americans. Even though I hate the war, I still have respect for America for it’s contributions of knowledge to the world.</p>

        <p>Saddam ruled by the time we invaded, and way before. We have had many disputes and problems with him decades before the invasion. When he was hanged by an election held by his own people, the people still a part of his regime (baaths) were left and still the wanted control and the power they had when they were being backed by Saddam. When we invaded we were trying to get Saddam out of office and put a new leader in to help Iraq become more stable as a country. We would put people in office (not American) that knew what they were doing. These knew officials would constantly live in fear and be threatened by the baaths, not knowing if their car would blow up the next morning driving to work or if they would be killed in the streets.</p>

<p>All the resistance is doing is making us stay longer, if they would leave us alone and let us finish up trying to get the country under control we would be out sooner than later. We aren’t just going to leave the country to a bunch of terrorist forces and let it remain a continuing threat to world security.</p>

        <p>I respect your views Frell, but I don’t agree with them.<br>
(addressed mostly to the last part of your paragraph)<br>
To my (admittedly limited) understanding of the specific situation, and from (a much stronger understanding of) other resistance forces in history, I would think that it is safe to assume that the resistance force in Iraq is desiring independence from American influence. Them leaving the U.S. forces alone to finish up would probably only result in a resurgence of resistance movements after the U.S. withdraws - bottom line, they probably represent the Iraqi populace, to what extent the populace shares their views and how large of a percentage of the total populace this is I do not know, that also wants independence. They will try topple the U.S. placed government and put in place their own if they do not agree with it.<br>
As for your terrorist definition, I prefer using Oxford Dictionaries to WordNet because I feel they are more true to the linguistic origin. Their definition of terrorist:</p>
<blockquote>terrorist
<p>• noun a person who uses violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.</p>
<p>— DERIVATIVES terrorism noun.</p>
</blockquote><br>
Note that, by this source, often considered to be an authority on the English Language, our own military forces could be considered terrorists. In a way, they are - nationalism and our views and values may try to hide that from us, but a definition doesn’t lie.
<p>Edit: grammar.</p>

<p>That is apparently the goal of these terrorist organizations, except its not just with the US. As i’ve said before the baaths want the power they had back when Saddam was ruling. Saddam payed for their expenses and supplied them with shelter, food, etc. Now hes gone and they feel blocked out of the picture and want that fake respect back that they had when everyone was terrified of them.</p>
<p>Remember, these are some of the most corrupt countries in the world that have been acting up for years. Along with being problematic to other countries.</p>
<p>Your definition might as well also mean war. What is war without the aim to overthrow power?</p>

<p>Saddam ruled by the time we invaded, and way before. We have had many disputes and problems with him decades before the invasion. When he was hanged by an election held by his own people, the people still a part of his regime (baaths) were left and still the wanted control and the power they had when they were being backed by Saddam. When we invaded we were trying to get Saddam out of office and put a new leader in to help Iraq become more stable as a country. We would put people in office (not American) that knew what they were doing. These knew officials would constantly live in fear and be threatened by the baaths, not knowing if their car would blow up the next morning driving to work or if they would be killed in the streets.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, it wasn’t too long ago that Saddam was an ally with the US, it was convenient for America at the time because of the tensions between Iraq and Iran. It’s funny how they supported Iraq in the war (Iran-Iraq war), even though the war happened well after Saddam’s government massacred the kurds and shiites. America is only quick to condemn genocide when it favors their agenda.</p>
<p>The baathists are a minority amongst the factions and any resistance you would see is mainly at the hands of sunni islamists. Most of the baathists fled to neighboring countries after the invasion.</p>
<p>You seem to be under the notion that the current Iraqi leadership represents ‘A man of the people’. The current president of Iraq, Jalal Talabani, is an atheist kurd. A non-muslim, non-arab leader in a country like Iraq can only mean trouble.</p>

<p>After looking at the US led invasion of Iraq, one can understand why the baath party committed such genocides.</p>
<p>At the time of the Iran-Iraq war, various kurds took an opportunity to revolt against the Iraqi government. Saddam’s government responded using chemical weapons and ended up killing thousands. Similarly, after the 2003 invasion, various different factions saw it as an opportunity to govern Iraq as they please. This time however, there was no Saddam to prevent it and rather than a few thousand dead, over one million Iraqis have been killed since 2003.</p>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not for the genocide. But it’s clear that America’s involvement in Iraq only made it much worse than it was prior to the invasion.</p>
<p>Initially, Iraqis were united in their resistance against America. However the Americans managed to ignite ethnic tensions (intentionally or unintentionally) which ultimately led to the infighting which was the main cause behind civilian deaths in Iraq.</p>

        <p>Ill be honest Mujahed, you did raise a couple of good points in what you’ve told me. But as always there’s a couple things i have a problem with :P.</p>
<p>First off, we’re starting to get off topic a little by discussing how iraq works. Which honestly i do not know much about. My general argument is that there are many reasons the war is justified, and we have discussed that many times before.</p>

</aside>
<p>By now im sure you’re familiar with the threat that Iran posed to the world. We did not agree with either side, but this was such an important event that we had no choice but to take Saddams side to stop ourselves from going over and taking on both forces (Which would have been horrid). At the time Saddam was not known as who is was today, but much more ‘trusted’ in a sense. Iran wanted control of the oil that supplies the world, this is obviously the reason why it was a world threat.  Saddam was against this at the time so we helped him out seeing as his plan seemed more promising to the safety of the world. Saddam also hated Iranians, and we knew Iran could destabilize the middle east by messing with the oil market. Iran was also where most of these terrorist organizations originated from, causing other trouble in the middle east. Saddam kept Iran in check, and by supporting him we could refrain from using our own military (mentioned before) and make sure Iran was watched.</p>
<p>We were loosely allies with Saddam until he went into Kuwait without our permission later after the I&amp;I war. This is where the US started to have concerns. Saddam pulled an Iran and thought he would try to take control of the worlds oil supply himself. After pushing him out the tables turned between the US and Saddam.</p>
<p>Thats why we supported him and why we stopped in a nutshell.</p>

Our main goal was to take Saddam out of control. We <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> have left after he was hanged, imagine how that would have gone.</p>
<p>You say that they saw it as an opportunity to govern Iraq, so technically we sparked the option for control between factions. This could have also contributed to creating racial tensions between the factions, just looking for one more reason to hate each other. 5 men want power, the leader dies. The 5 men each personally want the power for themselves now, and start looking for reasons to dislike each other and fight for the power. In a way we did spark racial tension, but that could have also happened inevitably over time.</p>
<p>I did a small bit of quick research and found that there was roughly 100,000-200,000 iraqis killed every year since 2003, until 2006-2007. This is where the deaths reached 1 million, a big spike for that year alone. Saddam was hanged in 2006. Using what i said in the previous paragraph, it cannot be proven that Saddams death did not contribute to the ignition of racial tensions which were a prime contribution to civilian deaths. He was also hanged December 30th, right at the turn of the year. Saddam was found guilty in November 2006, but taken out of control in April, which im sure news about the opportunity to overthrow power spread around the middle east quickly.</p>

This is apparently the car bomb death count total according to BBC. Car bombs are a major tactic used by these fighting factions and this graph can show the increase in the years i’ve mentioned above.</p>
<p>If you look at a total death count graph, it rises steadily until 2006/2007 and then declines slower than it raised.</p>

</aside>
<p>How would that make the other factions feel with the Shiites having control? It would be a civil war all over again for them.</p>
<p>We were never concerned with the countries in the middle east until the fight for control of oil started between them, and the oil market threats. Billions of dollars come into these countries every year, and if you’ve noticed, none of it goes to rebuilding or the citizens of the countries. Instead it is mostly paying for weapons and other military needs for factions.</p>
<p>Once every country either weens itself off of foreign oil (including us) or puts these countries under control, these countries would eventually die out from lack of income, meaning lack of ammunition for the factions fighting for the power. And all the countries currently deployed over in the middle east could focus on rebuilding and helping the middle east instead of getting it under control. Bush figured these people were very deprived of information about the freedom in western countries, along with the northern European countries. By giving them a taste of freedom he figured they would jump on our side and want this kind of government for them. The plan pretty much backfired but there were too many factors that started the war to pull out for that reason, as it was only one of many.</p>
