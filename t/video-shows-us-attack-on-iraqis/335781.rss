    <title>Video shows &#39;US attack&#39; on Iraqis</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/video-shows-us-attack-on-iraqis/335781</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the internet&#39;s biggest sources of classified government information has released video of what it says is a US helicopter firing at civilians in Iraq.

WikiLeaks, a website that publishes anonymously sourced documents,]released what it called previously unseen footage on MondayIt said the footage filmed from a helicopter cockpit shows a missile strike and shooting on a crowded square in a Baghdad neighbourhood in July 2007.

The website said 12 civilians were killed in the attack, including two journalists, Namir Nour El Deen and Saeed Chmagh, who worked for the Reuters news agency.The two men appear to survive the first strike and attempt to get away, but the helicopter returns a second and third time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;5th April 2010 10:44 EST WikiLeaks has released a classified US military video depicting the indiscriminate slaying of over a dozen people in the Iraqi suburb of New Baghdad -- including two Reuters news staff.

Reuters has been trying to obtain the video through the Freedom of Information Act, without success since the time of the attack. The video, shot from an Apache helicopter gun-site, clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers. Two young children involved in the rescue were also seriously wounded.


The military did not reveal how the Reuters staff were killed, and stated that they did not know how the children were injured.

After demands by Reuters, the incident was investigated and the U.S. military concluded that the actions of the soldiers were in accordance with the law of armed conflict and its own &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;.

Consequently, WikiLeaks has released the classified Rules of Engagement for 2006, 2007 and 2008, revealing these rules before, during, and after the killings.

WikiLeaks has released both the original 38 minutes video and a shorter version with an initial analysis. Subtitles have been added to both versions from the radio transmissions.

WikiLeaks obtained this video as well as supporting documents from a number of military whistleblowers. WikiLeaks goes to great lengths to verify the authenticity of the information it receives. We have analyzed the information about this incident from a variety of source material. We have spoken to witnesses and journalists directly involved in the incident.

WikiLeaks wants to ensure that all the leaked information it receives gets the attention it deserves. In this particular case, some of the people killed were journalists that were simply doing their jobs: putting their lives at risk in order to report on war. Iraq is a very dangerous place for journalists: from 2003- 2009, 139 journalists were killed while doing their work.[/qoute]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>ITT Australia already ran away. Also, American troops have supposedly left the streets and are in their bases while they only come out for special operations. Most other countries, if not all, have run away from the mess.</p>
<p>Right now it’s Iraqi army + police + shiite militias + sunni awakenings vs. sunni resistance.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, the leader of the ‘islamic state of iraq’ was allegedly killed. Although that’s like the fourth time they’ve announced that they killed/captured the same man (Abu Omar al-Baghdadi).<br>

              <p>Put yourself in the gunner’s shoes. Soldiers should have a mentality which is pretty much summed up as “kill them before they kill you”. That’s it, there’s nothing more to it, it’s war. It is not an honorable thing, and it is certainly not something to be picked at by people who have never experienced it. If you were the gunner in the helicopter, and on a thermal vision you saw something hanging on someones side you’d immediately think that they have some sort of weapon.</p>
<p>Thermal doesn’t provide perfect vision, but I can easily see how they would of mistake that for a RPG. I mean, if you saw that, a group of people walking with guns, you’d assume they could be potential enemies (problem with these wars you cannot see who is an enemy and who is not. The rules of engagement given to troops is fire when fired upon, which means they cannot fire unless they are <span class="bbcode-b">sure</span> they are an enemy, or they are shot first).</p>
<p>If you’re all so good at looking at a thermal image and telling what is a weapon and what is not, why don’t you apply for their job? The gunner’s responsibility is to shoot what they are told to shoot. They were told to shoot and they shot.</p>

<p>Well im pretty glad that they brought this to our attention (sarcasm) this didn’t make headlines anywhere from what I saw except for the front page of msn for about a day.

<p>Congrats on your ignorance, you meant to say “it didn’t make headlines in the US”, it made headlines in Britain on (pratically) our biggest news network…<br>

              <p>[quote=“MujaheD, post:54, topic:335781”]I don’t have much to say about your last post, just a a little bit concerning the 2006-2007 surge in car bombs.</p>
<p>I don’t think the execution of Saddam Hussein was relevant because he had already been captured long before the surge.</p>
<p>In 2006 after the Americans killed Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, alqaeda united with other factions to form an umbrella organization called ‘the islamic state of Iraq’. Various tribes also pledged allegiance to Abu Omar al Baghdadi who was the leader of the state. It formed it’s own government and implemented it’s own laws in various areas which were under it’s control.</p>
<p>In 2007, infighting broke out between various Sunni islamist factions and the ISI(<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/25/AR2007032500600.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/25/AR2007032500600.html</a>). This ultimately led to a surge in the ‘Sunni awakenings’ - a coaltion of Sunni tribes that united against alqaeda. It is widely known that the Sunni awakenings are responsible for the reduction of violence in Iraq.</p>
<p>I had more to say but I think i’ll save it for the next debate ;).</p>

<p>It’s funny how they supported Iraq in the war (Iran-Iraq war), even though the war happened well after Saddam’s government massacred the kurds and shiites.</p>

<p>Hm really? Saddam takes power in 1979, the war “officially” starts in 1980. And you say well before…ok if you say so.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was wrong with that particular situation. But America does form alliances with countries, which it would otherwise consider illegitimate, when it comes to it’s advantage. i.e Saudi Arabia.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ok sorry I didn’t mean to be rude I was just pointing it out.</p>
