    <title>Contents of shop missing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/contents-of-shop-missing/542720</link>
    <description>Hello,

I got a linux (centos) vps today. Sadly if I run my source on the vps, the contents of the shops in-game are missing. When I ran it before on my own computer, the shops were just working. I got no errors while running my source on the vps. Further it is just working fine. I hope someone can reply the fix here. If you can&#39;t, I can provide you my source zipped and if you want you can fix it for me and give the source back. :) I hope you can help me!  ;)</description>

              <p>It could be that your directory is mislabeled now too. “/data/shops.cfg” is not the same as “\data\shops.cfg” They are still system dependent.</p>
