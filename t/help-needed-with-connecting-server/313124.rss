I did edit in Client.Java 127.0.0.1 in my ip  and compile but i cant play with a other computer can someone help me ? Its my first time that i got a VPS and that i create a RuneScapePrivateServer. If someone knows why my server cant be online post here please.

Thanks for reading.

              <p>Use no-ip duc not VPS. Once you get no-ip create a host and check it off in the little box that opens up. Now change everything from 127.0.0.1 to yourservernamehere.no-ip.biz</p>
