    <title>Npc text + tele + starter =1?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-text-tele-starter-1/310926</link>
    <description>Ok in the process of making my new idea of a server i need to know how to do this:

You spawn in XX location (Not decided yet)

You talk to NPC

He explains :

You&#39;re in the barren zone out here - you click click here to continue
We need to get you out of here, - again, click here to continue
And get you into a race, and fast! - again click here to continue
You must choose either X or X - again^

Then each race comes up as an option :

XXXXXXX
   or
AAAAAAA

You click XXXXXXX and it tele&#39;s you to a certain coords
you click AAAAAAA and it tele&#39;s you to a certain coords


Thats 1 bit^, ill elaborate if needed, other part after this code i need

Starter added - i can do that additem etc, 

But then how do i make it so its starter = 1 so you can&#39;t just go back and get another starter?

If you can help with any of the above then thanks, ill give you my msn if you need it- Rep++ for help + credits, thanks again</description>
