    <title>Amazon Client V6 Connection Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/amazon-client-v6-connection-error/253857</link>
    <description>When i load Amazon Client V6 i get this Error Message &quot;Connection Error - Retying in #&quot; and a little box titled RicScape Cache down loader is stuck at 0% I have not edited anything and when i looked though the forums i found post from people who are having the same problem. I found this post from the soul
[quote=&quot;the soul, post:5, topic:245055&quot;]The cache has expired.[/quote] saying that the cache is expired. Is this true? How can i fix it?

I think i just need the cache so could someone that has ran this client go into
[code]C:\.amazon_cache[/code]
and give me the contents of that folder?</description>

              <p>Thanks but i found that if you just manually download the cache and put it where the client looks for it then you can run it fine! This is how i figured it out</p>
<p>While reading around i found a post by the soul telling someone the cache is expired. i didnt understand this but i still seeked a answer. Then i found this topic by the creator of amazon client<br>
“My Version of a Custom Webclient [trytohaxme]” in that tut one thing i learned was how to change the cache of his client and possibly others. It showed me where the cache was being downloaded so i could either change it or manually download it. If you manually download it you have to place it in <code>C:\.amazon_cache</code></p>
<p>Here is the link to manually download the cache<br>
<a href="http://www.fileden.com/files/2008/10/28/2162631/cache.zip" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fileden.com/files/2008/10/28/2162631/cache.zip</a></p>
<p>For those of you who think i am some weird 40 year old virgin who has nothing better to do but place viruses on stupid ass peoples computers then open up the client.java in amazon client v6 and search</p>
<p><code>private Class44 method67(int i, String s, String s1, int j, byte byte0, int k)
{</code></p>
<p>if you look a little ways below that you will see the download link i posted above.</p>
