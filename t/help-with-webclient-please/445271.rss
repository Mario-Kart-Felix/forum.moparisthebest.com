    <title>Help with webclient PLEASE</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-webclient-please/445271</link>
    <description>Okay, so my me and my buddy are making a webclient for out server.

We are getting an error, and can&#39;t find it. It has something to do with progresschecker, but at the same time it&#39;s not a problem with progresschecker. It&#39;s confusing, and I&#39;m an amateur at this stuff, so if you can please help us that would be awesome.

We can communicate through skype/teamviewer, and he is even willing to pay a couple of bucks to whoever can do this. It would be GREATLY appreciated!

Most of you will probably read this and be like, &quot;go read a tutorial&quot;. The thing is, he did, and now he&#39;s having a problem. Thank you. :)</description>
