    <title>FractionRSPS Awesome Eco, Community, Great Combat System</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fractionrsps-awesome-eco-community-great-combat-system/547333</link>
    <description>FractionRSPS was created in October of 2013 by the 2 owners Mikk and  Dany. The creation did take awhile since it was the first server the two of them have setup. The initial setup including the time for the beta server and testers to play took around 2 weeks before the server was online to the public.
Since then Fraction has had nothing but a growing community.
As of August 8, 2014 FractionRSPS has outdone itslef with releasing its own new source that reveals alot more to the community! This took about a month of work from the owners and admins to get it to where it is now.
Everyday we are looking for a new challenge and hope to make an impact on all players that come through our sight!
