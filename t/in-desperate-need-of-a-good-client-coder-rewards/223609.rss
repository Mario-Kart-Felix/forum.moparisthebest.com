    <title>In desperate need of a good client coder :) [REWARDS]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-desperate-need-of-a-good-client-coder-rewards/223609</link>
    <description>My site is growing in popularity, 10,000 views in past week, so I ask a favour since I am currently using silabsoft client.

Because it is for my game, it needs to be good.
Here is what it needs to have (if you can do any of these things post, or if you know someone, post)

[ul][li]Full auto cache downloading.[/li]
[li]Sprites in cache if you want... not 100% necessary.[/li]
[li]All models must be in the actual cache, e.g 377 or higher, and if you can, the ids must be the same as silabs, or you can leave them and I will change. [u]We cannot have them in a models folder because it will not add them for other players.[/u][/li]
[li]Basically just all the skillcapes (t if you want), bandos, armadyl, 3rd age, d boots etc, torso, defenders and all that.[/li]
[li]Reloadable.[/li][/ul]


Rewards:


[ul][li]Lifetime of free membership[/li]
[li]2147m (or 2 b ingame)[/li]
[li]Mod spot reserved for you, for when you earn it.[/li]
[li]Credits on site, client, forums and ingame![/li]
[li]If you think of anything else, please say.[/li][/ul]


Please help me I will pay you back, I could also pay you dollars through time... but that would be buying so let&#39;s not talk about rl money.</description>
