    <title>639 summoning help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/639-summoning-help/438953</link>
    <description>Ok so i&#39;m working with a 639 and it has summoning but when i make a pouch and try to summon something it doesnt work... What do i have to do to fix it? Thanks
 
Also i&#39;m having trouble with a trade issue, when i click to trade a player it will pop up saying &quot;administrator can&#39;t trade players&quot; so i search for it then delete it all, but yet i still can&#39;t trade.. Any help would be much appreciated Thanks!</description>
