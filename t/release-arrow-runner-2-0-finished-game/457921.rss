    <description>Hello!
Finally, Arrow Runner has been completed. You can view the project thread on the Rune - Server project development board (it is a tad outdated, judge the game; not the thread.

[URL=http://embulum.com/ArrowRunner.jar]Download - ArrowRunner.jar[/URL]

I appreciate feedback a ton, whether it&#39;s positive or negative as it helps a ton for my future projects. I&#39;m planning on starting up a new project in the next few days (it will be much more complex and interesting) so make sure to check the Rune-Server project section regularly.</description>
