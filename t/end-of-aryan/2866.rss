    <description>I befriended a pmod while mining. When she was about to leave I popped the question

This must&#39;ve been what they were talking about in the &quot;Runescape-Better then ever&quot; Topic.

Get your autoing in while you can I suppose. The&#39;re installing a new java, programs will have to be rewritten I&#39;m assuming.</description>

Sorry to burst your bubble, but that isn’t happening BlackThursday…</p>
<p>Whats with everyone saying SCAR will rise again, SCAR works perfect right now, and you can run two acounts at once with Microsoft VM (Virtual Monitor.)</p>
<p>SCAR has never died, and never will enver…</p>
<p>Anything that Runescape makes, SCAR can overcome, not like other scripting languages.</p>
<p>Obviously not many people here are part of:<br>
<a href="http://www.villavu.com/forums" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">www.villavu.com/forums</a><br>
Anyone who is dreaming of an ultimate Java bot created by the ‘famous ones’ mentioned above, well this is like the same thing, but with SCAR.</p>
<p>It’s an include, made by some of the best SCAR scripters of all time, such as Fakawi (leader,) Mutant, Benland (Math Genius!), Dankness, Pyro, Kernel Klink, masquader, renax, Starblaster, Lorax, and many other awesome scripters!</p>
<p>There are plent of working scripts for SCAR now, that you can leave overnight.</p>
<p>Why is everyone saying they hope SCAR returns when it already has! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Wow… you don’t think we ALL (except for n00bs) haven’t heard and are using SRL… don’t act like your squanto bringing corn to the pilgrims alright? And hell what I said was just a thought, some people liked kaits where everyone kinda helped each other out. As for your thoughts on SCAR, its good right now, but its still not as powerful as a javabot can be, so it will have to be improved, but for dectability sake, its perfect.[/quote]</p>
<p>Exactly. Sure scar is still alive, but it could be a lot better if everyone was focused on it rather then Aryan/Other java bots. The majority of noobs will go away, and some will stay and hopefully grow up to be great scripters.</p>

lol theres a way around every thing u guys are talking like its all done there are ppl just like me who wants to take down runescape and i don’t think i little JDK update will stop them from making better cheats<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Look, dude.  If they go to the latest JDK, ANY CLIENT EDITING AT ALL will end.  Period.  End of story.  Game over, man.  No decompilers exist for that (at least not in the public domain, possibly some private ones exist).</p>
<p>If Aryan dies and SCAR returns, then the glory days of RS cheating shall return.  Jagex is happy, the old-guard RS cheaters are happy, and the newbs all quit RS cheating because “OMG SCAR IS TOO HARD TO USE OMG OMG OMG OMG <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> :(”[/quote]</p>

<p>Wow… you don’t think we ALL (except for n00bs) haven’t heard and are using SRL… don’t act like your squanto bringing corn to the pilgrims alright? And hell what I said was just a thought, some people liked kaits where everyone kinda helped each other out. As for your thoughts on SCAR, its good right now, but its still not as powerful as a javabot can be, so it will have to be improved, but for dectability sake, its perfect.</p>

<p>Well, I completely agree with the sentiment of ruining Runescape. I think it’s a great idea to ruin Runescape. Why? Because they have already killed the original game that made them great, and now just run a glossy, ugly, shitty game which has no style and no heart so addicts can get their fix, and Jagex can get rich.</p>
