    <title>My Upcoming Inactivity</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-upcoming-inactivity/109269</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;BobDole81, post:1, topic:107595&quot;]Well, I just wanted to let you know that I will be pretty inactive for roughly a month.  I&#39;m heading to England (west side of London if anyone&#39;s interested) on Tuesday, visiting and attending a family wedding.  Before Tuesday, I&#39;m driving down to Pittsburgh this evening for my graduation tomorrow (I&#39;ve been attending a cyber school for the past few years, so the event isn&#39;t quite nearby :P)  Along with my college placement tests scheduled right in the middle of all of this, I&#39;ve kinda been busy as of late :).  While away, I will probably have some time while there to check messages and such, but other than that my moderation activity will be limited until around the 6th of July when I return. [/quote]

Mentioned this to the other mods/admins the other day...thought I should let everyone know, as I don&#39;t want people to simply think that I&#39;ve disappeared (as I have done in the past).  I&#39;ve still received a huge number of pms this past weekend, when I was away, but hopefully this should cut it down a bit (somewhat wishful thinking, but one can dream, right? :))

Anyway, I shall return with my normal activity, then, in early July ;)</description>
