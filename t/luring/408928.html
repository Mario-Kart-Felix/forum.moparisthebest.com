        <p>[quote=“Fridder, post:10, topic:408928”]Here’s the story, hopefully I don’t forget any details. This happened 12:30am last night… or for you people that use other time, 0:30am.</p>
<p>I was cooking some food to try to get my cooking level up, as I want 99. I heard it’s the easiest 99 to get. As I’m out of raw food, I went to the GE to sell the cooked food and buy some more raw food. While I was there, I sat there waiting for the food to buy… I wasn’t sure if I should woodcut or wait for the food and come back in the morning. So I sat there… thinking. Since I was only 130k from 91 woodcutting, I decided to get out my hatchet. Then a guy said ‘Nice santa hat, I’ll lend you my blue partyhat for the santa hat, I want to try it on.’ So he lent me his blue phat for the santa… Looked like shit, phats are ugly imo. So he took his partyhat back and gave me my santa hat back. (Both were lent to each other) He said “I made this partyhat from luring. Want to know how I did it?’ I said sure. Who wouldn’t want to learn how to lure someone and make billions? That damn hat is 2.1b. He explained to me that he needs a partner. I decided to go with him, and he said 'here’s how we’re going to lure them. Here, take 5 Falador teletabs. What we’re going to do is get a rich low level with rares on to come with us, telling him we’re doing a drop party. He’d follow us to the Falador drop party room. No suspicion there. We’d go there with the kid we’re luring, and tell him that the guy with the 10b whos having a drop party is on their way back from the KBD. He wanted to do one last trip. Then, he would suggest we play clan wars to kill time. Clan wars has been moved north of Falador. We’ll go, you can be on the other kid’s team, so we can let him kill me. That way his hopes get up, then next round we do dangerous. You have to ask him loads of questions to keep him distracted from ‘items dropped on death’.” … Basically I thought I was going to lure him, when they were both a team luring me. It was set up, and I figured that all out, but then I got a bit tired, stopped paying attention… “I look good (the kid we were luring who had a santa hat on and full bandos.) … but you don’t look good. You have to take out your santa hat that way the video looks good.” - The video was a lie, we were making him think it was a KO video with max hits. My ‘partner’ told him that. We sat there for 2 hours arguing. He wanted me to put my hat on, I was so annoyed and unfocused so I just put it on. I had a teletab in my inventory, I thought that would work. So what my ‘partner’ did was freeze <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">me</span></span> and kill me. Combat was disabled, it was just magic. I got frozen and couldn’t run. I couldn’t use the teletab, ‘teleporting has been disabled in here’.   If I were him, I would have killed the kid with the bandos, who cares if it’s his partner, unless he knew him irl…</p>

<p>So you went from wcing/cooking to dying. Also, to find out how to lure, you don’t need to follow them all you need is an explaination…</p>

        <p>I never knew it was luring, but I’ve been dealing with these people since I was like, 9. Some dude said he would sell me a whip for 500k, just meet him infront of the bar in varrock toward the wildy. Back then, a whip was about 4-5m. So I get there, and he’s standing in lvl 2 wildy, chopping trees. I say cmere. He says just come to him and trade him. He’s like 30 levels higher then me, but then his idiot friend walks a bit forward, just to the point where my screen can see him. He’s about my level. My successful 9 year old brain computes that the magical lookin’ dude around my level is going to kill me.</p>
