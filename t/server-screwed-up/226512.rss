    <title>Server screwed up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-screwed-up/226512</link>
    <description>I clicked on a portal I made and it was supposed to change my heightlevel, which it did. But when I logged off and logged back on I was still at that height level and all the objects i added in the game where at that level too......  So i changed my height level in the char file and it didn&#39;t work.</description>
