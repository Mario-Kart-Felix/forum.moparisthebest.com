    <description>Anyone here invest in any amount of these or other precious metals? (Also if you have do you keep it as physical or shares and where like in bank or at home?)
Also what do you project the prices of these two will rise to within the end of the year or next year?
Seeing as Germany has decided to bailout Euro and US Fed announcing QE3 I think they should be doing fairly well over the next couple months.</description>

<p>You can speak so much you want about the gold standard, but it is based on what people want. If nobody want your gold, then your currency drop very quickly in value. Food would be a much better way of basing a currency. It would secure stable food prices and you would avoid crisis because of a rapid increase in food prices.

this is very true but eventually we get to the point where you have enough and more food and all other things so you need to store your wealth somewhere since you cant just make more gold or silver (well not on a large scale at least) and silver is needed for many many things + has anti bacterial properties. But i totally agree that you should focus on (at least materialistically) 1.water 2.good nutritious food 3. self defence</p>

gold backed currency isn’t the be all end all of money, and since neither of us are economists I’d rather avoid a discussion about it, but the only reason paper money was backed by gold originally was because gold was a recognised currency at the time, the original bank notes were on the line of “I promise the bearer £5 worth of gold/silver”, the paper wasn’t worth anything but it was tradeable for gold, and the gold wasn’t worth anything but it was tradeable for goods and services, you can just as easily have money backed on feathers if people are willing to perform services and trade goods for feathers<br>

<p>I am well aware gold is useful in electronics, but I am doubtful the price of gold is determined because of its use in electronics. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>I actually heard that metals are a decent thing to invest in for the future as they’d be rising. One of the people I know invested  €200 worth in oil shares when he was about 10 (his grand father did it for him as a present) and last year they were worth around the €48,000 mark. Just goes to show some things are worth investing in.</p>

              <p>Anyone here invest in any amount of these or other precious metals? (Also if you have do you keep it as physical or shares and where like in bank or at home?)<br>
Also what do you project the prices of these two will rise to within the end of the year or next year?<br>
Seeing as Germany has decided to bailout Euro and US Fed announcing QE3 I think they should be doing fairly well over the next couple months.</p>
