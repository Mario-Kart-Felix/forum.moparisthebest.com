    <title>Need help with some programing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-some-programing/158726</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;d like to know if there is any Mod/Admin/Owner spells that you like or have heard are good, and provide a link and or a code, 
I would also like to know about any realalistic D bow specs that you know of and again code or link please.
Also, how do I change the exp rate of gaining lvls in combat, right now it goes from like 1 - 99 in 5 clicks and thats way to easy.

If you you can help it would be much appreciated. Thanks again in advance.</description>

              <p>Ok, just to say somthing, i highly recommend you not to get an owner/admin/mod spell. it is laggy and does not make for a good server. As for the d bow special, look for it in TUTS, or download a source with it and leech. or code your own.</p>
<p>as for the exp rate, im gussing your using the old, dummy = attk, door = str and hay bales = defense.</p>
<p>ok now if you are using silabs client or moparscape 3.2, when you right click on somthing it gives you a number</p>
<p>looks kind of like this: <code>####  ####,####</code></p>
<p>now the first number is the id, or case.</p>
<p>So if you want to change the exp value rate for say the dummy, you would opn up your client.java and hit control-f. then search for</p>
<p><code>case 823:		
if (actionTimer == 0) {
sendMessage("You attack the dummy.");
setAnimation(0x326);
addSkillXP((60*playerLevel[0]), 0);
addSkillXP((30*playerLevel[3]), 3);
addSkillXP((15*playerLevel[18]), 18);
actionTimer = 12;
}
break;</code></p>
<p>now this is just an example of attacking the dummy.</p>
<p>so where it says <code>addSkillXP((60*playerLevel[0]), 0);</code><br>
the 60 is the amount of exp<br>
and the [ 0 ] is the skill number.<br>
0= attk<br>
1= def<br>
2= hits?<br>
3= idk<br>
4= str.</p>
<p>so where it says 60, if it takes you like 5 hits on your server its probably around 3000000, because 99 is 14m exp. so change that to anyrate you want. save. compile. and your done.</p>
