    <title>Coding issue?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/coding-issue/218516</link>
    <description>Alright you see this code
[code]			case 1959:
				playerLevel[2] += 100;
				deleteItem(1959,getItemSlot(1959), 1);
				sendMessage(&quot;You eat the pumpkin, and gain 100 strength levels!&quot;);				
				refreshSkills();		
				break;[/code]
It works, whenever you eat a pumpkin your strength gains 100 levels! But this code doesn&#39;t work...
[code]			case 1959:
				playerLevel[3] += 100;
				deleteItem(1959,getItemSlot(1959), 1);
				sendMessage(&quot;You eat the pumpkin, and gain 100 hitpoints levels!&quot;);				
				refreshSkills();		
				break;[/code]
It works on every skill i have tried it except on hitpoints.  Does anyone know why? Is there for some reason a rule that you can&#39;t go past 99 hitpoints.  Well when you train like say strength you can&#39;t get past 99 it won&#39;t let you.  Your hp starts at 99 from the beginning.  I don&#39;t understand.  I can go into character files and change hp and it stays, but this code just won&#39;t work for hp.  Please tell me.</description>
