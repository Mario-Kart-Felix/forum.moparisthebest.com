    <description>4.	To reduce speed to travel longest journey, one must find a way to enlarge MA using simple machines.  What simple machines might assist?  ________________________
5.	Weigh the materials that you plan to build your car from to find out the mass and write here ______________________kilo.
6.	Let us measure the force in Newton loaded in a mousetrap spring: 325 grams.  Since 1 Newton is 102 grams, let us calculate how much Newton 325 grams is equal to and note here: ____________________Newton.
7.	 Potential energy in a loaded spring is     E= fxdxπ (f is spring force, d is length of spring arm which measures 0.1175 meter long on the test MTV, and pi is a constant representing the angle of torque in radian for 180degree turn of spring arm); therefore, energy in spring: ___________________joules.   It is important to know the hidden energy in a MTV spring because this is the wealth of energy that we are going to spend as efficiently as possible.  

8.	It is also important to know that after MTV has gone a certain distance the work done: W=fxd (work will be done by the potential energy from above in Joule and force needed to move lab MTV is 0.05 Newton); therefore, maximum distance:  d=W/f = _____________ meter.  After the spring energy is  consumed, MTV will continue to cruise an additional distance (almost equal to initial distance) due to inertia (or initial speed). Maximum distance Dmax=2xd= _________________ meters.  

9.	This is the theoretical maximum distance using energy equation ignoring energy losses and mechanical systems.

10.	The true maximum distance greatly depends on the circumference of drive wheel (radius of typical CD is 6cm); therefore, C=2xRxπ             C=2x0.06x3.14= ________ m.

11.	The number of revolution of drive axel will determine how far MTV will go; therefore, the number of times we wrap the rope around the axel determines the total number of revolution of the drive wheel.

12.	The length of rope that we wrap around axel is determined by the travel of spring arm which, in this case (referring to item 7), is Dia=2x0.1175= ___________.

13.	This length of rope will wind around the axel rod of 3mm diameter. The circumference of axel c=πxd= 3.14x0.003= ______________ meter.

 

14.	To calculate number of axel rotation, we must divide the length of pullable rope by axel circumference: Rpm=Dia/c= ___________________ times... 
15.	Rpm multiplied by circumference of drive wheel will give you half of the distance traveled (remember inertia): Dmax=2xCxRpm=                __________________ meter.
