    <description>Ok, for about 1 week now i wanted to try to add specials.  But i only found 2 tuts and they both didnt work.  They were both on rune-server.  And I googled this like a million times and nothing helpful came up.  And I can&#39;t find one person who can help me.  Usally the special attack bar is like in what kind of combat you want to train, but my friends server has one in the emotes...And if someone could help me add specials (god swords, whip, DDS, ETC.) I would REALLY REALLY apreeciate it (O and I can&#39;t spell that good)</description>
