    <description>hello, i was just beginning a new project to transform a blank allstar source into a good decent server, but now when i log in there are no npcs. i did not delete anything from autospawn.cfg, and i have not touched npc.java or npchandler.java. the only thing i have done recently is make a new system for the wilderness, and try and make a shitty anti null thing. i wish there was an error from compiling or from the server, but there isn&#39;t, so i have absolutely no clue what is causing this. if you think you know please tell me so i can fix it! thanks a lot, otherwise i might scratch this whole damn project.... or have to restart...  :eek: :mad:</description>
