Hey guys, 

I started a new project called &quot;Phuriate&quot;, And for the record this is not an advertisement thread. 
I made this topic to search for some developers that might be interested in helping.
I can&#39;t do this on my own, because I only really have experience the in web-based aspects of the project.
We are basically using a close-to-blank PI (317), and I have a lot of ideas that would make great features, I
am just not experienced enough to add them myself.

3. OPEN

All we really need are some Server/Client developers, the web-based coding is all handled. We have a full website, with a forum, and a working highscore/vote4cash system. All we are simply looking for are developers who know what they are doing when they handle the server/client files. Some positive criticism is appreciated, not looking forward to flamers.
[i]If you are a server/client developer looking for work, you know how to contact me.[/i]

Btw, I feel like I don&#39;t need to post pics. Everyone/Almost everyone already knows what a blank PI is like.</description>

              <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I’m applying for not a developer rank but for this rank<br>
Co-owner And Staff Manager</p>
<p>I know it sounds stupid applying for this rank but im so experienced it is un-true (no joke) 2.5-3 years of experience and dedication to RSPS playing near enough every single day. I play RSPS for 6-11 hours a day and have done for a long time and love it.</p>
<p>I hope i can come and help you to manage your server and prove to be a great staff member and make the server the best it can be and manage the staff team in such a way they are one of the best around.</p>
<p>I look forward to your reply…<br>
P.S Skype Name  =  rs.ps.1</p>
