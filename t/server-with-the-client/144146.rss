    <title>Server With The Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-with-the-client/144146</link>
    <description>If i have a server that requires a specific client (with 377 cache), which i also have but don&#39;t know how to fix, how do i make it require this instead? Cant connect to the server with this client because of that simple weird reason. So if you know, please reply.

Rep + For help btw.[br][size=1]Posted on: September 16, 2007, 07:22:05 PM[/size][hr]Also, ive tried to connect with other 377cache clients, and it does work. So its like something telling the server it HAS to be 377cache, i just cant figure it out.[br][size=1]Posted on: September 16, 2007, 07:44:41 PM[/size][hr]I got informed by Frell that this is not possible. Correct?</description>

<p>Anyway, the easiest way to disable mopar is this ( if this is what you want O.o )</p>
<p>put this in your boolean process</p>
<p><code>
sendFrame126("You MUST Use A 377 Client Cache, Mopar Is Disabled.",18585);</code><br>
Since mopar can’t handle them directly…</p>
