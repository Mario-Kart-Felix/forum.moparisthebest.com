    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-server-is-being-updated/535872</link>
    <description>I was able to connect to my server fine a few minutes ago, but now for some reason when I try to connect, the client gives a &quot;The server is being updated. Please wait 1 minute and try again.&quot; I can&#39;t seem to figure out why it&#39;s doing this.. Anybody help? It&#39;s set to local host, 0.0.0.0 and it was working fine earlier, so idk what happened..</description>
