[B][I]Hello, I&#39;m in need of developers for the spots below. The spots listed in green, are available, the spots listed in red, are taken. It&#39;ll also contain the person&#39;s name beside it. [/I][/B]

Goliath is a server for the players, by the players. I&#39;m not that experienced with coding, but a fast paced learner. I do know how to add models, update basic things, add shops, etc. But I could learn if someone&#39;s better than me, assisting me or what not. Basically Goliath is a Ruse based source. However, i&#39;m trying to make it different. In examle, develop the client which makes it different from Ruse. Also update interfaces in-game, and update how things work. I hate to fully leech servers, I want to develop Goliath into something great. 

Interested? Use the below format to apply just by simply commenting...
[CODE]Age? 
Position Applying for: 
Experience: 
Days a week available: 
How many hours a day?
Proof of work (if possible): 
Do you have Skype?[/CODE]
