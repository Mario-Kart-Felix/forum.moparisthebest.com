    <title>Need some basic help? Look here!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-basic-help-look-here/543854</link>
    <description>I am offering my services in troubleshooting and problem solving, I feel that people on here could use some help without the sarcasm and useless comments, so here I am.

Here is what I can help with:
[ul][li]Compiling Errors/Issues[/li]
[li]Questions relating to code[/li]
[li]Fixing up code/syntax[/li]
[li]Cleaning of code[/li][/ul]


If you want my help you MUST provide the file(s) on pastebin and post the link so I can actually help you.
My skype is projectcxr if you want to request the help on skype.
If you&#39;re having a compiler issue, post a screenshot of the compiler window, not just copy and paste one or two lines out of it...</description>
