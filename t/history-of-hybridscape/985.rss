    <description>Feel free to post with more history but this is my version

March 27th 2006 - ashley gets angered at the constant unreliablilty of whitescape and shuts down the her server for a bit but sense i couldnt quit private servers all together im addicted i start plotting how i can overcome this problem. i switched to my old scaperune server and soon remember what a pain in the but it is, but theirs alot of good features on scaperune so i came up with the brilliant idea of just taking some of the files over from scaperune and putting them in my whitescape folder and just compiling... over 100 errors (i realised it wasnt going too be easy but it must be done... ok i wasnt that nooby but it sounds better by saying that :p ) so i developed the idea of hybridscape.  I started it just as a personal project but soon realised it was going too be hell too do by myself (plus im way tooo nooby too do some of the stuff) so i decided that i would ask for some help.

March 29, 2006 - i ask for some help and i was quite surprised at the feedback i got some of the biggernames with privateserver editing came out and offered too help very shocked at the amount of interest everyone was having i release the version i had working so far the first night which was just the unfinished scaperune gui on a whitescape server i called this Beta 1. Again i got too be surprised how impressed people where i mean comeon it was just the GUI but whatever :p

march 30, 2006 - i worked all day on getting some commands for the GUI working i finally asked for help from rictoo but we still didnt get it so i put a plea of help too moparisthebest.. about 5 minutes later i pulled off a way too do it and release 1.5 again a BIG Hit also Hybridscape is fully introduced with a CVS

march 31, 2006 - moparisthebest makes this forum for just us devs guess he likes this idea of this :p and the mapping code was completed by trigun and fasga idk who would take claim over it because i used alittle bit of both too make it. thus the realeast of beta 1.6

april 1st, 2006 - Ashley releases version 2.0 which has whitefanges dialouge handler in it a very nice update :) credit too whitefange

april 2nd, 2006 - version 2.5 released with a GUI upgrade, newbiehacker fixes the logout problems with making public voids static and a ban handler is added
