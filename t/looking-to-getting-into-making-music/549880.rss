    <title>Looking to getting into making music</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-getting-into-making-music/549880</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m not sure if this is the right place to post this, but anywho..

I love listening to music that have a really good beat, which has motivated me to start making beats of my own. One problem; how and with what?

So the thing I&#39;m asking you guys is that:
1. Which programmes are good for this type of thing?
2. Any tips?

Thanks :D</description>

              <p>You might want to try the tracker route instead of using FL. Famitracker (NES/famicom music + some extra channels), deflemask (Gameboy, NES, Genesis, C64 and some others), and renoise are all excellent.</p>

              <p>[quote=“hely, post:3, topic:549880”]It doesn’t really matter what DAW you uses, you just got to play around with it. It is kinda compareable to an IDE. If you are running OSX I highly suggest u use logic pro x since it’s extremely easy to use and delivers high and professional quality and doesn’t require much knowledge of daw’s or VST plugins.</p>
<p>If you’re on windows I suggest u get FL studio, mainly because a ton of people use it and there are a lot of tutorial for it so it’s great to start with fl studio and maybe move on to ableton in a later stage.[/quote]<br>
Even if it is a late reply, I appreciate it a lot. Going to using FL studio and hopefully come up with some good tracks. Thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Be warned that to get realistic sounding instruments in garageband will take some time and fiddling with modifiers.</p>
