    <description>[b][i][u]Finally we release our server, we used alot of time to make this server![/u][/i][/b]

* Banner included website / forum advertisement, removed. 

If you like regular Runescape Classic... You will love this, Rsca has ruined staking and pking with there &quot;leet&quot; combat system.... Well we have looked into it, and have created a virtually identical combat system as the real runescape classic... The one thing that isn&#39;t perfected is when you are fighting someone and there armour is off, you seem to hit a little more 0s then you should. Wow, still the closest combat system that has ever been released.

Also the Pking and Dueling stat is a new addition to Rsc-Private Servers, There is only 1 other server with the pking stat, which they bought, and no other servers with dueling as a stat.

Server currently has an xp rate about 8x, There are also only 2 admins and NO mods, we will be choosing later, and I assure you, there will be no faggot mods banning people for no reason or power tripping. The duty of a mod is to only catch autoers and help players in need. They are not allowed to stake nor pk on there modded account so that the game is completely fair.

There is so much going on with this server, if you like Rsca, you will love this server, come give us a try, and help build a community.

**Note** We are running on a decent Dedicated Server, with a auto restart and DoS protection.

Also right now we are making all our money from advertisements that people click on the forums, Donating is allowed but we will not be giving out items or stats to the people that do.

We will not be shutting this server down, I know everyone says this, but we really will not be, This is our 3rd server, but our first with the rscd base, Our other servers were Rsc-Remix, and Rsc-pkz.

I promise you this server will be big, so why not get a head start on everyone.

We will be holding events that will give a certain amount of the following : Party Hats, Halloween Masks, Scythes and other valuable rares.

We will also be giving rewards to whoever has the highest Dueling and Pking lvls at the end of each month.

Santa Hats will be dropped during Christmas.


We are also currently implementing 4 quests : Dragon Slayer, Heros, Lost City, and Vampire Slayer.

So please come join us, and help make our server big, You will not regret it

Lol. You need to remember what you type.  You say it already beats RSCA then you say “You wait until it happens.”  And, as I said in BOTH of my other posts, if I’m not mistaken, I HAVE TRIED THIS SERVER.<br>
And, if you read my other posts again, I SAID THERE WAS NOTHING GENERALLY BAD WITH THE SERVER.[/quote]</p>
<p>I said that not him</p>

<p>I love how ksv and p0tz think this server is going to be as famous as rsca and as popular as rsca when a) ksv and p0tz fail at being admin, they’re very unprofessional and b) they can’t code nearly as good as k09 and will never be able to fix the packet corruption that 100+ players online brings, plus the several other bugs that rsca has that k09 fixed they will never be able to fix. This is your what server? 3rd? 4th? I lost count at two, personally. You and ksv are too immature and unprofessional to run a good server. This server fails, and I bet it wont last for more than a month.</p>

Thats what we have done the least of. And the combat formula? Pets hasnt even perfected it, and as far as I know, I am the closest to the real Rsc combat. Sleepwords is xml editing, adding full thieving is xml editing? Re adding godspells is xml editing? Dupe bug is xml editing? auto cast fix is xml editing? webclient is xml editing? all the new commands are xml edited? Lots more, but yea your right those are all xml edits idiot… Webclient I have been working on bymyself for a week figuring it all out, I had asked for help but everyone wanted liek 50 dollars. But yea the formula is so simple that besides me, only pets has gotten it decently close?</p>

              <p>Haha 19/19, like ive said 10000000 times before, bitch you loved our server, go ahead and fucking deny it, you spam everything I say because you feel like a hurt little kid, and have to resort to flaming to make yourself feel better. We never said omfg its gonna be better then rsca, and it pwns rsca, ACTUAL PLAYERS SAID THAT. As far as fixing corrupted packets at 100 plus people, I bet you there will be no problem at all. Also this is our 2nd server, rsc-remix and rsc-pkz was 1 server, just edited the name because of the source I released. Also by you saying all that about ko9s server you pretty much are telling everyone that we will get over 100 players. I am very mature and professional, you sir are the immature one, thats why you have flamed every single post I have ever made, with your little crying insults and your FAILS, your really no good to these forums, and no one likes you. 1 month eh? Ill make sure to post after 32 days laughing at your stupid ass. Thanks</p>

              <p>I love how ksv and p0tz think this server is going to be as famous as rsca and as popular as rsca when a) ksv and p0tz fail at being admin, they’re very unprofessional and b) they can’t code nearly as good as k09 and will never be able to fix the packet corruption that 100+ players online brings, plus the several other bugs that rsca has that k09 fixed they will never be able to fix. This is your what server? 3rd? 4th? I lost count at two, personally. You and ksv are too immature and unprofessional to run a good server. This server fails, and I bet it wont last for more than a month.</p>
