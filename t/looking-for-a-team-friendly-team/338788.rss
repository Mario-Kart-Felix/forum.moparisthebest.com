    <description>Okay so i&#39;ve bein working on A blank 317. 508 look a like [Only gameframe &amp; bank is 508 nothing else. Also i got 12 quest&#39;s working and 1 custom quest.
Most skills work. All stairs etc. But i want to make the server popular and make it famious after i made it perfect.
Anyways, when its finnish i&#39;ll be putting up donations and Forum for my server. (i&#39;ll share with my team.)
Heres some coding im pro at ;
-Npc dialogue.
-Making quest&#39;s.
-Object &amp; Npc spawning.
-Welcome message.
-Also this &quot;+playerName+&quot; For example Hello &quot;I pk 4lyfe&quot;. &quot;+playerName+&quot; will say the name of the player.
-And whole lot more cba to post all.

Coding experience.

Thank you all.

And it has fully leecher protecton, dont even bother trying it. aswell speaking of it, its an Ip system so if the team decide to leech then ill block ur Ip, dont need to speak more of that.</description>
