    <title>How do you write over a picture?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-write-over-a-picture/188921</link>
    <description>what program do you use to write over a picture but it doesn;t mess it all up. when i copy words from microsoft work and past it in paint it leaves white all around the letters how can you write and still see the picture through the holes in the letter.

example:

The letter O in the middle you could see the background and all around.

Thankyou</description>
