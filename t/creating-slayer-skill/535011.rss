    <title>Creating Slayer Skill</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-slayer-skill/535011</link>
    <description>Alright, so I have the slayer skill package in my server, but I added it myself. So I believe there are things Ill have to add to other folders such as NPC handler, player assistant and so fourth.
No idea where to start though, does anyone have any ideas?</description>

              <p>Well I tried lol. That’s about all I Can say.  :palm: Nowadays there is so much added junk that has been implemented into the Slayer skill and I’ve having a hard time find a simple source with a simple slayer skill. I can build thing off of it once its there but getting it is an issue <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I already have my slayer master set-up with dialogues and such. I have the slayer skill from another server already in my “skills” folder. Now I just need to set something up there where if I put .getSlayertask() into the Slayer masters dialog that correlates with the Slayer skill package in “skills” Ill be good. I want the absolute basic slayer (Ask for a task, get one, kill and get xp, finish task, come and get another one)</p>
<p>Is there anyone who would be willing to team view with me and set that up&gt;?</p>
<p>Im using Eclipse IDE which will make things breeze by hopefully.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone</p>

              <p>I would look at a server with Slayer already implemented and then create your own using that as a reference. That is what I did when I made my own because I ran into the same issue.</p>
