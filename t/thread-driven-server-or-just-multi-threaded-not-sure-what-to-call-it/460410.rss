    <title>Thread Driven Server (or just multi-threaded, not sure what to call it)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thread-driven-server-or-just-multi-threaded-not-sure-what-to-call-it/460410</link>
    <description>I just had a simple idea, don&#39;t know if it&#39;s correct or efficient, I would just like to have this confirmed. How would it work out using a multi-threaded server, but having a new thread for most common tasks, such as, skills have their own thread, the networking has its own thread, and player updating having it&#39;s own thread. What do you think?</description>

<p>Not a lot of people on this forum can classify their self as proficient in programming. But that shouldn’t stop you from talking with other people who have information that could prove invaluable to your learning of both a programming language and also the RS2 protocol.</p>

</aside>
<p>Both can be a problem, since both will sooner or later lose all efficiency when scaled up. You should try to balance your server so that it will perform at its best. If you know your server will be running on very low end hardware lets say 2-4gbs RAM, and say a duo core cpu then you may have to opt for a server that uses say 1 thread for logic, a thread for I/O, then a thread for networking. Try to not have your I/O operations like saving and loading on the same thread as your logic, if your server sends a lot of data then it will push back your logic processing, this is one of the many reasons why WinterLove loses a lot of performance.</p>
<p>Now for a multi-core or even a multi-processor. When you create code that is executed by multiple threads at the same time you will need to make sure that your code is thread safe, I proved a link below to a thread Graham created that explains thread safety. A benefit to using multiple threads is you can have Entity updating done in parallel instead of just one at a time in a single thread, you can do this because Entity updating doesn’t have many write operations more or less a change in the local player list is all that happens for a write operation which you can synchronize with very little lose.</p>
<p>You can either read over this or just talk on irc with some of the more programming proficient bunch.</p>

              <p>Sounds more or less like the Thread-Per-Client model with the exception of a thread per connection… It wouldn’t work out to easy and would be fairly hard to implement since you would need to make sure all code that would be executed by multiple threads is thread safe, so any gain from it could be lost due to synchronizing.</p>
