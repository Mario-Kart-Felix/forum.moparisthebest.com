    <title>SRL anti-random behavior</title>

    <description>Hello,

Has anyone made a function that I could use in SRL to play an audio alarm and pause the script so I can take care of the random/mod/other stuff it can&#39;t handle instead of logging out or switching players?

I&#39;ll be near the computer most of the times I plan on having scripts running and I believe it could lower significantly my chances of getting characters banned. (I know, having the alarm sound while I&#39;m not there would be worse than logging out, perhaps a countdown of some sort?)

Thanks in advance,
