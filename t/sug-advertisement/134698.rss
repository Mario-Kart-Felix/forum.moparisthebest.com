    <description>OK, I&#39;ve had a couple suggestions in the past, which we&#39;re neglected after sometime, and didn&#39;t actually happen. And this one probably won&#39;t either. But I think it should be done. Normally my suggestions are more thought out, and include more explanation, diagrams, etc. But anyways, to the point. I think we should place text ads on http://MoparScape.org. Not just any ones, but https://www.kontera.com/ The ones that are Blue and have a double line underneath. 

Anyways, we all know MoparScape nubs click on just about any link placed in front of them, so why not add the ads, they don&#39;t require much criteria, and they pay by clicks. Think of the revenue Moparisthebest could get from this. Which he could turn around and use on the site, or put in his own pocket. You could possibly, and this is very unlikely, upgrade the forums to VBulletin? Or even get a designer Homepage, like Flash or something, not saying S!ms wasn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s not used often anymore, and there&#39;s new like a year old news article on there. 

I mean there are things that could be done on there that don&#39;t even require cash, or much time. You know, I&#39;ve had alot of ideas, and I think soon I&#39;m just going to make a thread with a bunch of Ideas in general. That could help the site. Now that I&#39;m off topic, and rambled quite a bit, I think I&#39;m done. I&#39;ll add more to this idea tomorrow.</description>

<p>But moparisthebest already has ad’s on moparscape? i know they are not the one’s you have suggested, but whats the difference?<br>
About the home page and the forums upgrade, mopar is not with smf because he can’t afford Vbulliten, its the fact smf &gt; *, its easily editable to how YOU want it, if you are fluent in web design.</p>
<p>The reason the homepage is not used, is because the community is the center piece of the site, however, on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> the center piece is quite obviously the moparscape client.<br>
Oh and the fact mopar’s to lazy to add any more news to the front page or give anyone access to upload their own news.<br>

Which the search button wouldn’t earn much profit since the mopar nubs don’t ever use the search button. (It’s too easy to make fun of them to be honest.)</p>
