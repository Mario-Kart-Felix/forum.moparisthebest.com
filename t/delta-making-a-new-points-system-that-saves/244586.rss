    <title>[Delta] Making a new points system that saves?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-making-a-new-points-system-that-saves/244586</link>
    <description>Well, if whoever helped me coded a Delta source before.. They would probably know how a points system works. Eg. Pest control, assault etc. Well I want to make my own points system, how?
Also, don&#39;t tell me that I need to put something in a &#39;more info&#39; file, because I looked through and Delta doesn&#39;t have one.</description>
