    <title>[PI/DSPK] Invalid integers cause disconnections</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-dspk-invalid-integers-cause-disconnections/483063</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a base that was made with PI/DSPK and I would like to fix as many random DCs as possible.

Firstly, I haven&#39;t seen a single DC that doesn&#39;t have something to do with an invalid integer.

So what I think I need to do is find where this is happening and make it to where when an invalid integer is entered/processed instead of disconnecting the player and throwing an error, it simply does nothing.

I&#39;m not exactly sure of everything that causes this but an example is someone using &quot;Bank X&quot; and typing a number higher than 2147M.

If anyone can guide me to which classes I may need to edit, or what code I might need to use to fix this, please do. I will rep++. Thanks.

Edit: It can also be caused sometimes from entering letters for withdrawing/depositing things.
Is there someway to make the server automatically return/disregard when the NumberFormatException is thrown?</description>

I tried something like this and it didn’t work but I’ll try your methods.<br>
Edit: Doesn’t work. :\</p>
