    <description>New-Reality was just released yesterday, we already have a growing playerbase!

MAX PLAYERS ONLINE SO FAR: 25

To start off, new-reality is based off near reality. Right now, new-reality is most similar to near-reality in about v11-v12. We are working hard each day, to make it look more and more like near reality at its prime of v13. We also offer a bit of that oldschool feeling in our current state of new-reality. We are an eco server, so you can pk, pvm, and a little bit of skilling for money.
