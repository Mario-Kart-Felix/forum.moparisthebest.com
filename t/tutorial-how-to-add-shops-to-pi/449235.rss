    <description>Hello, Moparscape members today im going to be releasing a tutorial on how to put shops on your server with a PI Source.

Requirements: Pi Source/Common Sense

Difficulty Level: 1/10
-----------------------------------------

Lets get started yea?

First thing first go into your PI source and start your server up and go to your webclient and login.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd thing to do is make a NPC that you want as a shop.
Example:
[img]http://i1037.photobucket.com/albums/a460/MDCMadman/560854646756.png[/img]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3rd thing to do is go back into your source files and search for ActionHandler.java \src\server\model\players
Open up ActionHandler.java and continue to the next step.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4th thing to do is make a new case
Search for something like this:
[img]http://i1037.photobucket.com/albums/a460/MDCMadman/28422518688.png[/img]

Make a new case:
Example:
			case 541:
				c.getShops().openShop(5);
			break;

Another Example:
                        case (NPC ID):
				c.getShops().openShop(Shop Number);
			break;

Keep This Part Open Next part well explain why.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 Opening up shops.cfg

Ok now open up shops.cfg and you well see a bunch of numbers in there already unless you have a blank source.

Now the reason you keep actionhandler.java open is because this part is where you get the shop number.

Ok Lets get started.
You should see already something like this at the top: //-----ShopID---ShopName-------- &gt;&gt; And so on

Ok Here ill make you guys a basic code for your shop
Make sure you guys tab in these by the way.
Example:
shop = 20	Rare_Shop	2	2	14484	100	1050	30	1057	30	1042	30	1040	30

14484 is dragon claws ID and it sells 100 of them.
1050 is santa hat and sells 30 of them.
And so on.
Now go back up to step 4 and where it says (shop number) Put 20 in there.
Then were done with that part and save both notepads.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6 setting the spawn-config for the npcs.

Open up spawn-config its in the same folder as shops.cfg

Once you have it open you well see a bunch of spawn codes.
Well thats what we have to do for our shop to spawn when you turn on the server.

Example:
//      spawnX    spawnY   height      walk      maxhit      attack     defence      description
spawn = 555	3089	3492	0	0	0	0	0	0	Rare Shop
Do not put spawnx in the first line where spawn = 555
It might confuse you a bit it did to me first too

The 555 is the NPC ID and 3089 is the SpawnX and SpawnY is 3492
Once you have this done save the notepad and exit that
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 7 and final open up prices.txt in the same folder as shops.cfg

Ok so open up prices.txt and once you have it open you well see a bunch of numbers

lets say you want to make a price for D Clawz
First Line:
14484 1300000000 (1.3b)
And if you want to make more prices go ahead
The prices might already be in there so just do Ctrl F
And Search the code
Once you have this part done then save this prices.txt and go to your first page of your source and compile it then run then walla you have your own shop.
