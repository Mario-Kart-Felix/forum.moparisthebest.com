<p>Install kubuntu and zombify it into a webserver.</p>
<p>/on topic: If there’s a password on the admin in safe mode and you don’t have the original cd’s then you’re pretty much screwed in terms of recovering the original Windows installation, so the only thing you could do would be to put a new OS on there.</p>
