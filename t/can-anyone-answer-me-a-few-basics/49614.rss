    <description>SO yea....I mainly play on PIMPScape....cuz I can&#39;t seem to get on any other servers...ever......oh well.  Anyways, practicing on my own IP, I am wondering on how to make the ability to interact with NPCS? How to spawn items (on the ground?) How to make things more like RS, basically.  Anything from anyone (advice) would be AWESOME! Thanks in advance  :D</description>
