[center]Well first of all thank you for looking at my post! I want to start off first by saying this is my actual first server to dedicate myself to. 

At the moment I am the only person working on the server and client, as of right now I plan to keep it that way.

Ok now to get into the actual part of this post that is about RSPS :). The server is run off of Hyperion figuring that it doesn&#39;t have crappy delta combat and is packaged a lot better than most other bases. Now I know there are people out there that hear Hyperion and automatically say, &quot;HYPERION SUCKS!!! DELTA FTW!!!&quot;, to you guys all I have to say is no, BAD! I have plan for this server and which I will be posting as I go along with the server.[/center]

[hr]

[i][u]Server Started: Tuesday, December 7[/u][/i]
As of right now I do not have a lot done, but figured it would be better to create the majority of this post first then edit it as I go. Also I know the banner is a little bare but I plan to edit it with the features I add as I add them.

[left]
Green = Finished
Orange = Started
Red = Not Started
[b][u]Skills:[/u][/b]
Range: 10%   ***Need to adjust the timer a bit, add specials and bolts &amp; X-Bow***
Prayer: 10%   ***You can bury bones but xp need to be adjusted and new prayers***
Magic: 2%   ***Need to add teleports, ancients, lunars, and adjust timers***
Cooking: 2%   ***Can cook some food, need to add select how many to cook and cook more foods***
Woodcutting: 10%   ***Basic woodcutting with random amounts of logs, want to add full woodcutting with stumps***
Fletching: 0%
Fishing: 10%   ***You can only fish with small fishing nets in certain spots***
Firemaking: 0%
Crafting: 0%
Smithing: 0%
Mining: 20%   ***Basic mining with any pick any rock but want to make it more versatile for rocks***
Herblore: 0%
Agility: 0%
Theiving: 10%   ***Some stalls work with animations and reward, need to add more stalls and pickpocketing***
Slayer: 0%
Farming: 0%
Runecrafting: 0%

[b][u]Minigames:[/u][/b]
As of right now there is no minigames, I&#39;m not too worried about these atm until I get the base of the server done. Although don&#39;t get me wrong I am going to add them and do have plans for them. I plan on adding some of the basic minigames...
Pest Control
Fight Pits
Fight Cave
Barrows
Duel Arena
Castle Wars
Plus I want to add a couple custom minigames...
I plan on adding a Boss orientated minigame based on some favorite bosses
I also plan on adding a minigame for low level players or skillers

[b][u]Quests:[/u][/b]
Quests are going to be somewhat basic once I tinker with the dialogue method a little...

Lost City
Desert Treasure
Rune Mysteries
Monkey Madness
Legend&#39;s Quest
Lunar Diplomacy
Knight&#39;s Legend
Lunar Spirit
Hero&#39;s Quest
Recipe for Disaster

Plus a couple custom quests based on some unlockable features such as ancient prayers. I may also add a couple of the easier quest for newer players such as Cooks Assistant, Black Knights Fortress, or Sheep Shearer.

As of right now I have only a couple pictures or videos worth posting since I am not that far into, but as I get into the server I will post the pictures.

12/07 Daily journal
[code]Not much was achieved today because I am having some trouble adding
global objects such as stalls or some fishing spots. Other than that I have sharpened
up some codes for some of the skills that currently work.[/code]
