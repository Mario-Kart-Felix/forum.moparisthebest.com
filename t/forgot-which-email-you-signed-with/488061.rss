    <title>Forgot which Email you signed with?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/forgot-which-email-you-signed-with/488061</link>
    <description>Well, now that the possible rs2007 server is coming back, I was trying to log in. Apparantly, all the emails I know don&#39;t work for it. Is there any other way for me to recover my account.</description>

You can trust it or not, I’m just answering his question. That’s not my problem if you don’t.<br>

<p>You can’t create a <span class="mention">@jagex.com</span> email, but you can mask the senders email address using it e.g. send a email from <a href="mailto:123@hotmail.com">123@hotmail.com</a> and the recipient will view it as <a href="mailto:admin@jagex.com">admin@jagex.com</a></p>
