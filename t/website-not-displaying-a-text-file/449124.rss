    <description>I&#39;m using 000webhost.com to host an applet of my 2D Game. I have all the resources (tile and sprite sheets as well as a map text file) uploaded on the host. The problem is that the FTP client can view the map file that I uploaded and correctly displays what is inside it, but whenever I navigate to that myself off of the site chrome says that the link is broken. It&#39;s not only the map file either. I have another text file that tells you what numbers go with what tile and chrome tells me that that link is broken as well. I feel that it&#39;s causing issues with the applet because it can&#39;t load the map, so any ideas?
