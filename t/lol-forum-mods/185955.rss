    <title>Lol @ forum mods</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lol-forum-mods/185955</link>
    <description>I decided to ignore the forum rules and see what Jagex&#39;s ass pirates would do if I posted about my old banned account.

(the word fletch seems to be censored)
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a thread to ask a very serious question, &quot;Why?&quot;. 3 years ago, my original account, Exe626, was banned for &quot;3rd party programs&quot;. Through every ban appeal I&#39;ve gone through, I&#39;ve received nothing more than &quot;we have proof you use 3rd part programs&quot;, yet, I&#39;ve never used one.

3 years ago I was doing a job, my job was to ****** yew long bows for people who supplied me with the proper supplies. I would ****** and ******, gaining countless exp, hopping from job to job. I did my work a quick as possible then returned their bows and I received my payment.

One day, I was doing a job in Alkaharid. A common spot to meat my clients. I would soon after ****** 500-1k yew long bows for the man, and head to Varrock to deliver the bows to him. At the time, I happened to be out of runes to teleport, so I figured I&#39;d just walk to the next bank.

On my way through the desert, I started lagging. Not a normal quick lag, a very intense lag. It got the the point where I was disconnecting. One attempt to log back in, I was informed my account had been terminated, and I would never see my account again just because I had a short stroll through the desert.

Even though I know, and others who are friends of mine, I have never macro&#39;d, Jagex has ceased to unban this beloved account of mine. The only excuse to why I&#39;m not unbanned is the excuse &quot;We have sufficient evidence you were in control of the account&quot;, which in all honesty doesn&#39;t make any sense, because of course I would have control of MY account.

I want Jagex to supply me with proper evidence to why they deleted my account after countless work and effort put into it. Jagex thinks they&#39;ve banned a macroer, all they&#39;ve done is steal the hefty amount of membership I still had on the account.

Gj Jagex.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, within seconds all the wannabe mods come in saying shit about the rules with their annoying little signature lines. Within minutes, Archaeox comes in and tells me I r fail.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Please read the Account Issues Guide at the top of this forum.

Please read the Forum Specific Rules - ranting about Customer Support issues is pointless, as nobody here can do anything to help. This forum is for the discussion of in-game features/content *only*.

Likewise, please note that posting on behalf of other accounts, even your own, is also not allowed by the Forum Code of Conduct.

If you feel that a ban or punishment is unfair, please appeal it using the &#39;Appeal an Offence/Ban&quot; link on the front page of the website. If your appeals (including last chance appeal) have been denied, there is no further option open to you - posting here will not help in the slightest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He then changed the title from &quot;Exe626&quot; to &quot;Edit: not appropriate&quot; lulz.


After reading his pitiful post, I decided to post something else; title was &quot;@Archaeox&quot;. This really got them wannabe mods going.

&lt;blockquote&gt;That was the biggest fail in Runescape forum history. Congratulations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within 10 seconds I had over 10 repliers and Archaeox with his godlike powers to &quot;set me straight&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Please read and follow the Forum Code of Conduct and Forum Specific Rules, as you are obliged to do under the terms of your contract with Jagex.

Not doing so will lead to sanctions against you account.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then I got a message from Mod Emily saying I had broken a rule and what I said is &quot;Serious business&quot;.</description>

<p>I used to love to mess with forum mods about moparscape, and within one minute the thread was locked, I tell you they brainwash their mods very well.</p>

              <p>I decided to ignore the forum rules and see what Jagex’s ass pirates would do if I posted about my old banned account.</p>
<p>(the word fletch seems to be censored)</p>
<blockquote>This is a thread to ask a very serious question, "Why?". 3 years ago, my original account, Exe626, was banned for "3rd party programs". Through every ban appeal I've gone through, I've received nothing more than "we have proof you use 3rd part programs", yet, I've never used one.
<p>3 years ago I was doing a job, my job was to ****** yew long bows for people who supplied me with the proper supplies. I would ****** and ******, gaining countless exp, hopping from job to job. I did my work a quick as possible then returned their bows and I received my payment.</p>
<p>One day, I was doing a job in Alkaharid. A common spot to meat my clients. I would soon after ****** 500-1k yew long bows for the man, and head to Varrock to deliver the bows to him. At the time, I happened to be out of runes to teleport, so I figured I’d just walk to the next bank.</p>
<p>On my way through the desert, I started lagging. Not a normal quick lag, a very intense lag. It got the the point where I was disconnecting. One attempt to log back in, I was informed my account had been terminated, and I would never see my account again just because I had a short stroll through the desert.</p>
<p>Even though I know, and others who are friends of mine, I have never macro’d, Jagex has ceased to unban this beloved account of mine. The only excuse to why I’m not unbanned is the excuse “We have sufficient evidence you were in control of the account”, which in all honesty doesn’t make any sense, because of course I would have control of MY account.</p>
<p>I want Jagex to supply me with proper evidence to why they deleted my account after countless work and effort put into it. Jagex thinks they’ve banned a macroer, all they’ve done is steal the hefty amount of membership I still had on the account.</p>
<p>Gj Jagex.</p>

<p>Well, within seconds all the wannabe mods come in saying shit about the rules with their annoying little signature lines. Within minutes, Archaeox comes in and tells me I r fail.</p>
<blockquote>Please read the Account Issues Guide at the top of this forum.
<p>Please read the Forum Specific Rules - ranting about Customer Support issues is pointless, as nobody here can do anything to help. This forum is for the discussion of in-game features/content <em>only</em>.</p>
<p>Likewise, please note that posting on behalf of other accounts, even your own, is also not allowed by the Forum Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>If you feel that a ban or punishment is unfair, please appeal it using the 'Appeal an Offence/Ban" link on the front page of the website. If your appeals (including last chance appeal) have been denied, there is no further option open to you - posting here will not help in the slightest.</p>
</blockquote><br>
He then changed the title from “Exe626” to “Edit: not appropriate” lulz.
<p>After reading his pitiful post, I decided to post something else; title was “<span class="mention">@Archaeox</span>”. This really got them wannabe mods going.</p>
<blockquote>That was the biggest fail in Runescape forum history. Congratulations.</blockquote>
<p>Within 10 seconds I had over 10 repliers and Archaeox with his godlike powers to “set me straight”.</p>
<blockquote>Please read and follow the Forum Code of Conduct and Forum Specific Rules, as you are obliged to do under the terms of your contract with Jagex.
<p>Not doing so will lead to sanctions against you account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I got a message from Mod Emily saying I had broken a rule and what I said is “Serious business”.</p>
