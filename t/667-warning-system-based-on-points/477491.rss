    <title>[667+] Warning System (Based on Points)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-warning-system-based-on-points/477491</link>
    <description>Alright, its been a very long time since i made an appearance, so i thought it&#39;d be time i posted a tutorial. Something  very simple that i made that works surprisingly well. You can of course rewrite this, as this is just a basic concept i guess. Well, lets get started shall we ^_^


First, the WarningSystem class. Put the file wherever you want, just remember to change the package declaration. 


[code]
//Change the package declaration...

package com.rs.game.player.content.commands;


import com.rs.Settings;
import com.rs.game.World;
import com.rs.game.player.Player;
import com.rs.utils.SerializableFilesManager;
import com.rs.utils.Utils;


public class WarningSystem {


   public static void IssueWarning(Player p, String playerName, int level) {
   Player warn = World.getPlayerByDisplayName(playerName);
   
   boolean LoggedIn = true;
   if (warn == null) {
      warn = SerializableFilesManager.loadPlayer(Utils.formatPlayerNameForProtocol(playerName));
      if (warn != null)
         warn.setUsername(Utils.formatPlayerNameForProtocol(playerName));
      LoggedIn = false;
   }
   if (warn == null)
      return;
   
   int Points = warn.getWarning();
   int GivePoints = Points += level;
   
   warn.setWarning(GivePoints);
   warn.getPackets().sendGameMessage(&quot;&lt;img=1&gt;&lt;col=FF0000&gt;You have recieved &quot;+level+&quot; warning points.&lt;/col&gt; (&lt;col=FF0000&gt;You now have &quot;+Points+&quot;&lt;/col&gt;)&quot;);
   warn.getPackets().sendGameMessage(&quot;&lt;img=1&gt;&lt;col=FF0000&gt;After you get &quot;+Settings.MAX_WARNING+&quot; warning points, you will be banned.&quot;);
   
   if (warn.getWarning() &gt;= Settings.MAX_WARNING) {
      warn.setPermBanned(true);
      warn.getSession().getChannel().close();
      p.getPackets().sendGameMessage(&quot;&quot;+warn+&quot; has been banned for exceeding 10 warning points.&quot;);
   }
   
   p.getPackets().sendGameMessage(&quot;You have given &quot;+playerName+&quot; &quot;+level+&quot; warning points.&quot;);
   }
   
}[/code]


First off, you will notice that this looks like some of the commands you might already have. That&#39;s pretty much basically what i did. I took stuff from a command, and just threw it in a class, and made a few modifications, nothing really special. I just didn&#39;t want a REALLY long command in my files, so i opted to put it in a seperate class, which cant hurt anything.


Next, we need to open Player.java and declare these with your other variables:

[code]public int warning;[/code]


That goes in with your saving stuff inside player.java. While still in Player.java, we need to create getters and setters, which are fairly easy, just copy and paste this in with the rest:


[code]
public int getWarning() {
      return warning;
   }
public void setWarning(int warn) {
       this.warning = warn;
   }[/code]


These, when called, will return the value of &quot;public int warning;&quot;. So if someone has 10 warning points on their record, it shows up like so:
You have a total of &quot;+player.getWarning()+&quot; points.


To set someone&#39;s warning level we use the setWarning method. (setWarning(Value) ;) 


But through the command, you wont have to set anyone&#39;s warning level like that, the class adds the points you have typed using the command below:


[code]
case &quot;warn&quot;:
   String Warn = cmd[1].substring(cmd[1].indexOf(&quot; &quot;) + 1);
   int WarnLevel = Integer.parseInt(cmd[2]);
   WarningSystem.IssueWarning(player, Warn, WarnLevel);
   break;[/code]
Also, please note that I have converted all my commands to a switch statement....You will need to put it as an IF statement if you want ;P


so when you type ::warn player 5
The player has been issued 5 points, and when you type it again, it adds 5 more to their current points. After they get 10 points, then they are automatically banned. 


The point system was for severity levels. Spamming and such being like worth 2 points, etc. If you want to take someone&#39;s points away, just type ::warn player -5 (using a negative number will take that many points away from them.)

ALMOST FORGOT: Add this into Settings.java:
[code]public static final int MAX_WARNING = 10;[/code]

Well, I hope someone has use for this and can rewrite this a little better. Just figured that since i havent contributed in a long freakin time, i&#39;d post something. 


So have fun guys
