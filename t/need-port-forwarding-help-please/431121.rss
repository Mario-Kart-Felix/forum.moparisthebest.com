    <title>Need port-forwarding help please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-port-forwarding-help-please/431121</link>
    <description>I&#39;m completely out of ideas. I know port-forwarding is easy, I did this a couple years back. But I&#39;m lost now. Can one of you geniuses take a look at these pictures and see if there is anything I may have messed up or missed. I also have TeamView if that would be easier. Thank you for any help!</description>
