        <p>Well i’ve been researching this for my current flash project and i thought i’d show you guys how to do it. Just in case anyone here fancies having a crack at doing their own actionscript game. This can come in handy for storing progress, so if a player reaches level 11 say you will want to make sure it loads at level 11 when they next open the game.<br>
So first we have to know what we are dealing with, we are using what is known as a Local Shared Object, it can remember pretty much anything that has happened in the flash animation.<br>
Ok so to start off you are going to need a new .fla file. If you are using CS4 it doesnt matter if you choose Actionscript 3.0 or 2.0 this will work on either. Now out of personal preference some people decide that they would like a new layer for actions and a new layer for the rest of it( or more depending on how much stuff you putting in frame) I personally dont bother, it just makes the timeline cluttered and messy. Either way open up your actions panel for the frame and start with this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">local_data = SharedObject.getLocal("GameData");</code></pre>
<p>This creates and gives a name to the local data, in this instance I’ve named it GameData but you can name it whatever you wish. Thats the file setup so it can be added to, modified and cleared by actions later on. To add peices of information to the file you will need a text box with a variable name( not an instance name, alot of people get this confused.) So lets say the variable of our text box is ‘points’. Within the actions of the frame you need to set up what that text box is equal to upon loading</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">points = local_data.data.points;</code></pre>
<p>So now the textbox displays the data set that is made of up of points. Technically i’ve explained this back to front, but i find its easier to get the sections of actionscript done togetther, so now you have defined that the data set is called points. But of course than can be changed like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">points = local_data.data.score;</code></pre>
<p>It is independant to the text box variable for the sake of making this easier i’ve kept it the same. Thats the reading of the data done, next is to write it, but of course in the scheme of things that comes first. So now you’ll need a button to write the data, so create yourself a save data button. Within the actions of this you are going to have to write the data set to the data set the frame is reading above. I will use ‘points’ as my data set as well as my variable for this example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">local_data.data.points = points;</code></pre>
<p>its the reverse of the reading code, this makes life easier if you are struggling to remember how to do this as you only have to remember one. Include this within the compulsory on(event) handler along with:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">local_data.flush();</code></pre>
<p>this stores it immediately.<br>
Now to clearing that data, if a user decides they would like to start their game again they need to be able to clear their data. So a new button and a new on(event) handler and you will need this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">local_data.data.user_name = "";</code></pre>
<p>this is removing the data stored locally not the text box, so if you only had this the data would be equal to a blank but the text box wouldn’t so you will need:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">points = "";</code></pre>
<p>this now has cleared the data and the text boxes. Its simple as that. This can be applied to almost anything, and it doesnt have to be something on screen. If perhaps say you were making an RPG game and you had a quest to collect something, you can have the object with its own data set which will be 0 then as soon as the player touches it, the object will be unloaded(required to be a movieclip for this) and the data set will be set to 1 so that the player can close the game inbetween quests of a game, this doesnt require a text box because its not being displayed. Well there you go, hope you at least take something from this.</p>
