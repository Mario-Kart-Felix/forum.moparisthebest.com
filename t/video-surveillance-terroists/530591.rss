Our school asked us to analyze opinions about the topic presented above ^

<p>Not like it matters but I choose not to vote due to the alarming number of idiots who usually run for office, either way we are going to be fucked by congress. Blame the people who run America, not the people who have very little say in what happens.</p>

<p>Yeah but did you vote on the lower branch of politicians not supporting Obama? Most people think just placing the vote for their president is all they have to do when they ignore voting for the people that will represent their vote. Electoral vote &gt; popular vote.</p>

<p>99% of Americans voted on keeping the status quo in the last election. I see that as a widespread approval of the government’s actions.</p>

              <p>If that is what makes you sick then you must have a very weak stomach.</p>
<p>Being from other countries is what allows us to see the flaws America has, we all have them America just takes pride in them. The congress alone makes decisions, the president doesn’t have much of a say as he is merely a puppet in politics. Then again, you vote for who should be in the congress and in power so the people are having a say.</p>
<p>Just because you’re American that doesn’t mean you’ve the opinion of your whole country. You’ll talk to other Americans who are proud to have troops fighting, you aren’t all the same especially if you’re from different sides of the country. You want to deny that you didn’t send the troops to war? Look at what they want and tell me you never use it, then you can say you didn’t need it. Your demand and everyone else’s demand for oil causes troops to go and fight, not the congress being snobs.</p>

<p>[b]America has been taking over other countries such as; Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran etc… and once they retaliate they automatically become terrorists.</p>

              <p>Well, personally i think America shouldn’t have to tolerate video surveillance. The idea of having everyone watched because of “terrorists” is probably a lie, the government is most likely just trying to be a “bigbrother” as referenced in the book “1984”. Terrorism can be stopped in many different ways, video surveillance isn’t going to stop or even prevent terrorism. If somebody wanted to attack an area of America, i think the last thing on the governments mind is “lets pull up camera 465339 and see what’s happening over there”.</p>
<p>People just need to accept that freedom is decreasing, and the government is only using this as a cover up as they’re basing it off America’s top most fear. Society prides themselves on freedom of choice and speech yet everything you choose and say is based of an influence already planted by the media. The media isn’t an independent body either, they’re controlled by the rich guys who usually coincide with government views.</p>
<p>Terrorism is just a practice of anger, if America didn’t want to be attacked they would stop picking on the little guys.</p>

              <p>How much video surveillance should Americans tolerate to keep the nation safe from terrorists? Discuss…<br>
Our school asked us to analyze opinions about the topic presented above ^<br>
And I was wondering if you have a sided or strong position in the topic and give me an opinion. I am not a very strong with debate sided topics…</p>
