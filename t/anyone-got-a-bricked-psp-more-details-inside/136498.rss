    <title>Anyone got a bricked psp? More details inside!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-got-a-bricked-psp-more-details-inside/136498</link>
    <description>Ok,

Ive been interested to see how many people are owners of bricked psp&#39;s (internal flash0 is corrupt)

im basically wondering this because I am working on a new mod for the psp (internal/external) and I need parts, and well I personally dont need it to start (nor do i wish to spend 200$ cad just to open it up for its hardware) So I was wondering if anyone would perhaps like to sell there bricked psp, i will pay a good sum for them (70-80$ *conditions apply)

Anyways if your interested give me a PM

And if this is by anyways against the rules (which i doubt it is, because im not selling anything just asking if anyone would be interested in selling to me) then dont hesitate to delete this thread =)

Anyways thanks =)</description>

<p>Lol. I’m sorry, but why would people sell something that costs 200-250 dollars for 70-80, when the educated googler could fix it himself…</p>

<p>Why would people think of a bricked PSP as a bad thing?</p>
<p>A friend of mine bricked his psp the day he bought it, gave it to me with the box, receipt, so I went, bought another and took the old psp and a new box and took it back, got a refund. He got his psp, I got £80.</p>

              <p>Well true, but i need a hd that is A) small B) doesnt require alot of power, and can be run off of 3.6v (still not sure on this, but i could always rigg up a requlator.  And something that would be relativly easy to make the psp reconise (via homebrew, or perhaps a plugin)</p>
<p>If u could find a hd, that is better suited to this (perhaps smaller would be a bonus, doesnt need 40 gb can be like 10-20)</p>

              <p>hmm, from what i kno i doubt its possible to unbrick a psp? Because your dealing with internal flash memory, you would need some way to access that, and the only way i could think of doing that would be well, breaking open the psp and inserting a new motherboard (EXPENSIVE lol)</p>
<p>Anyways nah im trying to get parts for a mod ive been thinking off for a while, im trying to find out a way to remove the umd reader from a psp and replace it with a hardrive from a ipod (thus having 40-80gb instead of like 8 :p)</p>
<p>Anyways to do this im thinking u would have to probably have 2 batteries going (one to power the unit and the other to power the hd) aswell i would like to replace the up,down,left,right buttons with another joystick (thus socom becoming awsome :p)</p>
