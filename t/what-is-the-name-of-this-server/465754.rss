    <title>~ What is the name of this Server ~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-the-name-of-this-server/465754</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I had a question, i&#39;ve seen this server somewhere on moparscape and i&#39;ve searched through server downloads yet I still can&#39;t seem to find it.
It has...
-Max Capes
-Minecraft Remodeled people as shop
-Also has Falcon &amp; Creepers as Shop people
-Has cool gear like voodoo masks, griffon mask, armadyl armor, and tons of other gear in donator shop
-I believe the home is in the Rogue&#39;s Den
-Pretty sure revision is 600 or less.

If you know this server, could you please post a link to where I could find it ~ Thanks!</description>
