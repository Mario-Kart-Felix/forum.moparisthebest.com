    <title>Shops problem? PI</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shops-problem-pi/500192</link>
    <description>Hi creating shops seems to be easy. I already got my NPC shop keeper in my server but when it comes to the application.java i need these codes..

it tells me to search (c.getShops().openShop) then add the shop blah blah but my application.java doesn&#39;t have (c.getShops().openShop)? i checked my other PI source and it does as soon as i type it in but for some reason this other source doesnt contain it. anyway i tried posting this code at the bottom at application.java

case (522):
				c.getShops().openShop(19);
			break;

and then i compile. i sign in and just see a shopkeeper which im glad to see cause im making a shop but like when i click trade nothing happens.. can someone maybe tell me whats going on and how i can add the shop code in application succesfully? im a complete noob with this.</description>
