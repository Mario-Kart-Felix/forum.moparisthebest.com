    <description>Welcome,

RscEdition is a new server coming to the RSC community. The server is in development and is going to be for about 2-4 months. If anyone remembers RSCStake me and my brother dan are the ones who founded and hosted that server. RSCEdition is going to be 100% legit unlike all these other servers where the economy is flooded with billions of dollars. Our goal for RSCEdition is to get as close as the real rsc as we can. xp rates will be 100% identical to that of the orginal RSC. All F2P/P2P quests and skills will be 100% opperational. there is going to be two worlds. One world will be F2P and the other of course is P2P. you will have to subscribe if you want the membership features. Again like I said, we are trying to get as close to RSC as we possibly can. F2P will only feature that of a non member such as you cant wield dragon, do member quests ect... In the future, if successful we will be opening up two more servers along with the two we will already have. Meaning 2 F2P servers, along with 2 P2P servers. alot of dedication and hard work along with the players such as your selfs will make this server successful. Please give your input on how we should make the server better. pictures will be posted soon on the development of RSCEdition.

 Thank you, and hope to see you soon in the community.
Sincerely,
Daniel.
Dallas.</description>
