    <title>Requesting Assistance for a Webclient [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requesting-assistance-for-a-webclient-pi/423445</link>
    <description>Hello Everyone,
     I am currently just adding finishing touches to my RuneScape private server. I have a Project Insanity based Client. The client is called: pvpscapez [PI]. I was having some issues with some of the .java files... In all of the Tuts I have watched or read on forums, they have all included some codes that are not in a few of my .java files. I have no clue on what to do with them. Some of these files include: class36.java, ModelDecompressor.java, and Sprites.java.
I would really appreciate the help. I do have Teamviewer, so that may be used in the process of completing this task. I will be looking for staff members and the position of admin for whoever assists me looks very obtainable. Here is my contact Information:
MSN: dominicfiore@hotmail.com

Thank-You,
              Kr Aw Ft</description>

              <p>I already have a jarring program, however I can’t seem to get my client to properly jar. I believe it has something to do with the files I listed above. Also, I do need help with active streaming the cache.<br>
Like I said, I do have teamviewer!<br>
Thanks,<br>
