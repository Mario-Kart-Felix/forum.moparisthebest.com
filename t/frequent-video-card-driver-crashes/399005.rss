    <title>Frequent Video Card Driver Crashes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/frequent-video-card-driver-crashes/399005</link>
    <description>I built the computer I&#39;m on a while ago. I did it mainly for being able to play more games, but as it turns out, I can play even less. My video card is a Sapphire ATI RADEON HD 5770 1GB 128-bit GDDR5, bought from newegg.com:

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102873&amp;cm_re=radeon_hd_5770-_-14-102-873-_-Product

When I play games the screen will go black for a few seconds and then come back to the desktop with a balloon popup from the task bar saying the driver just recovered from a crash. Sometimes I even get a blue screen saying my computer was shutdown because the attempt to recover the driver timed out. I&#39;ve already RMA&#39;d this card once and it didn&#39;t help. I have no idea was going wrong. The driver it up to date an everything. Any ideas?</description>

              <p>You should be able to get a refund for the card, bring in your computer to a best buy and have them match the best graphics card that will work with your computer, they do that for free if you buy the card.</p>
