[u]Want[/u] to make money for designing? Or get to work with top notch designers and learn how to have group initiative? Coast Life is here for you!


[u]Coast Life[/u] is a company set for the likes of freelance designers, all the way to full college trained graphics designers. 

[u]Our[/u] goal is to offer experience to designers, who want to improve on their skill level with first hand experience. Employed designers get working as part of a team, with the opportunity to earn money at the same time!

[u]We[/u] are also a friendly upcoming graphic design community for people to visit on the social thing. Users can expect a rare download section and join in on conversations related to graphics, among other traits.

[u]If[/u] you&#39;re not a graphics designer, but own a website that needs a flashy banner or logo, then we can help. Drop a job request on the forum and our group of experienced designers will attend the brief and produce what you hopefully were looking for.

[u]Neither[/u] of the above? Then join us anyway to chat with some people and basically, to have a good time.


[u]Lastly[/u], if you register you can post a topic in the Welcome Section or if you are willing to apply for the team, post in the Join Us! section. If you post in either of these, [u]please say that Josh referred you[/u]. We are currently holding a referral competition.

              <p>For a community with “top notch” designers, their template needs a lot of work…<br>
[<em>] Font color for the banner does not go with the rest of the template<br>
[</em>] Random orange on the rounded corners<br>
[<em>] No anti-aliasing<br>
[</em>] Horrible font choice for the banner… I mean seriously, can’t you find something better then Birth of a Hero?<br>
[*] The banner for the forum is pretty bad too…</p>
<p>Anyways I registered…</p>
