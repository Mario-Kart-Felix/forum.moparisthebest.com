    <description>Hello everyone, I would like to introduce something new that will help new servers out A LOT

I am offering free forum hosting

it would be something like www.rs-palace.com/YOURserver here
With No-Ads At all!

if you want a shorter domain then just get a .co.nr domain

The requirements for this are:
1. 20+ people at an average online per a time

If you would like this service then please use this layout

[code]
What is your forum name:
What is your server:(link to it)
Proof:(picture with people on showing your server name also and your name on the server)

<p>And real hosting doesn’t HAVE to cost money. There are countless sites out there already that host forums and sites for free. Alternatively they could just set up their own webserver, its not the hardest thing in the world to do.</p>

<p>I realise that this is just a stunt to advertise, and I would suggest simply submitting your site to the top 100 sites and all that. Get a few friends to vote every day and after a while your site will be up there with the rest.[/quote]</p>
<p>No, this is NOT just a stunt to advertise… this is to help out servers…</p>
