              <p>[quote=“tehpkplace, post:2, topic:219998”]This is very easy ok.</p>
<p>You will need to open client.java, autospawn, and shops.cfg.</p>
<p>First in client.java search for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">wanneshop = 40</code></pre>
<p>You will find all of the shops.</p>
<p>If you want to add a new shop under the last one in your client.java, and figure out which shop id is the last.<br>
So if you are using raw devolution 7.0 your next wanneshop would be 43.</p>
<p>In those you can figure out some basic stuff like the npc that you will ascess the shop from.</p>
<p>Then open up shops.cfg and above something like [endofshops] or something (I don’t have the source on me at the time), you will add:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = Your new Id      2        2 </code></pre>
<pre><code>The items and the amounts from here on out, remember to tab each one.  (2 represents a shop that only buys items sold in the shop) (You can replace 2 with 1, which will represent Like a general store)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally open up autospawn and spawn your Npc that runs the shop.</p>
<p>Hope I helped.[/quote]</p>
<p>I Said Dodian Source…</p>
<p>Dodian Source Doesnt Have Autospawn And Shops.cfg.</p>
