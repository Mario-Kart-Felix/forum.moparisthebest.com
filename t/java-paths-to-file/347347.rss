    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-paths-to-file/347347</link>
    <description>For some reason, it seems when I try to run the same java application on the Ubuntu distro, it cannot find the cfg files. I had originally done this on Windows XP, and had no problems. I am curious, do I need to use different paths or anything? Or should I just run it using wine.</description>

<p>Can lock this now if you wish.</p>

Don’t run it using wine, just fix the paths.</p>
<p>Things to watch for is case (UPPERCASE or lowercase) which matters in linux but not in windows (in windows, AA.txt and aa.txt are the same file, but different in linux).  Other things to watch for is drive names, they don’t exist on linux, there is no reason to use them on any system because it shouldn’t be hardcoded, it should either be relative to ‘.’, or the user.home property. Also use ‘/’ as a path separator, because it is cross-platform.</p>
<p>Post the paths you are using and I can help you more.<br>
[/quote]<br>
As an example (i already know about the file-names and the drives parts) here is a line for calling the “settings.txt” file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">BufferedReader file = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("\config\settings.txt"));</code></pre>
<p>I am not 100% sure, but earlier I got the idea, would calling it like this, be calling from my user’s “home”-folder? “\home\t-rev”[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that wouldn’t be valid anywhere.</p>
<p>You generally want to use a path like this that is cross-platform:<br>
either:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">BufferedReader file = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("./config/settings.txt"));</code></pre>
<p>Which will read from a folder named config in the directory the program was ran in (’.’ means working directory)<br>
Or you would want a specific folder in the user’s home folder:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">BufferedReader file = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(System.getProperty("user.home")+"/your_apps_folder_name/config/settings.txt"));</code></pre>
<p>Got it?  And that one path will work on all operating systems.</p>
<p>For example, in MoparScape which can be run on all operating systems my path looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">new File(System.getProperty("user.home")+"/.moparscape/WHATEVER_HERE");</code></pre>
