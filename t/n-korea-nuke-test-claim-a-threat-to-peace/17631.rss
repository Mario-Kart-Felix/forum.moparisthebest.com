    <title>N. Korea Nuke Test Claim A Threat To Peace</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/n-korea-nuke-test-claim-a-threat-to-peace/17631</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Bush on Monday said North Korea&#39;s claim that it has tested a nuclear weapon is a threat to international peace and said the world &quot;will respond.&quot;

&quot;The transfer of nuclear weapons to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States,&quot; Bush said. &quot;And we would hold North Korea fully accountable to the consequences of such action.&quot;

Bush said the U.S. was still trying to confirm whether North Korea had actually tested a nuclear weapon as it claimed earlier Monday.

He said he&#39;d spoken with the leaders of South Korea, Russia, China and Japan.

&quot;All of us agreed that the proclaimed actions taken by North Korea are unacceptable and deserve an immediate response by the United Nations Security Council,&quot; Bush said. (Transcript)

China, a close ally of North Korea, denounced the claimed test as &quot;brazen,&quot; and South Korea said it would respond &quot;sternly&quot; to a move that experts said raised fears of nuclear terrorism and a regional arms race.

North Korea&#39;s ambassador to the U.N. Pak Kil-yon said the council should &quot;congratulate&quot; North Korea&#39;s scientists and researchers &quot;instead of [issuing] such notorious, useless and reckless resolutions or whatever the statement against&quot; North Korea.

Pak said the test was &quot;very, very successful&quot; and will contribute &quot;to the maintenance and guarantee of peace and security in the peninsula and the region.&quot;

When asked if North Korea plans to conduct further tests, Pak told reporters &quot;that will be enough, you don&#39;t think so?&quot;

Bush said North Korea &quot;remains one of the world&#39;s leading proliferators of missile technology, including transfers to Iran and Syria.&quot;

When North Korea warned last week that it intended to conduct a nuclear test, international analysts said it could unleash a regional arms race and give a virtual green light to Iran, which the United States suspects wants to develop nuclear weapons. Experts also fear North Korea may allow terrorists such as al Qaeda access to its nuclear weapons technology.

&quot;This immediately affects the calculations of South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, all of whom might decide that they need to have their own independent nuclear arsenal as well,&quot; said international security analyst Joseph Cirincione of the Center for American Progress. &quot;If North Korea gets away with this, Iran will be encouraged to go forward.&quot;

If confirmed, the test would be the first of its kind since Pakistan detonated an underground nuclear weapon in May of 1998, said Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. North Korea would be the eighth nation to successfully conduct such a test, he said.

North Korea has recently test fired seven missiles, including a long-range ballistic missile in July, but it&#39;s unknown whether Pyongyang possesses the high-technology expertise to construct a nuclear weapon small enough for a missile delivery system.

On Wednesday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill said, &quot;North Korea can have a future or it can have these weapons. It cannot have both.&quot;

Immediately following North Korea&#39;s announcement Monday, South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun said Pyongyang has &quot;broke the trust of the international community.&quot; (Watch South Korea&#39;s Cabinet meet about what to do next -- 7:00)

Roh said it brought &quot;a severe situation that threatens stability on the Korean Peninsula and in northeast Asia.&quot;

Abe told the same news conference his country would work &quot;to make ways to implement action for a tough resolution.&quot;

Australian Prime Minister John Howard suggested financial, trade and travel sanctions, saying a &quot;strong international response is called for.&quot;

CNN&#39;s Dan Rivers, speaking from the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, said the key question now was what China -- which effectively allowed North Korea to exist economically -- would do. (Watch a quick timeline of how the situation reached this point -- 2:09)

The apparent nuclear test was conducted at 10:36 a.m. (1:36 a.m. GMT) in Hwaderi near Kilju city, South Korea&#39;s Yonhap news agency reported, citing defense officials.

South Korea&#39;s state geology research center detected a 3.58-magnitude &quot;artificial earthquake&quot; in a remote area of North Korea&#39;s North Hamgyeong Province, according to the news agency. Judging from the seismic tremor, the center said the power of the explosion was equivalent to around a half kiloton of TNT explosives, Yonhap reported.

Reports of the claimed test triggered global condemnation (Full story).

South Korea&#39;s Defense Ministry raised the military alert level. (Watch how the world changes after a North Korean nuclear test -- 2:09)

&quot;The field of scientific research in the DPRK (North Korea&#39;s official name) successfully conducted an underground nuclear test under secure conditions on October 9. ... at a stirring time when all the people of the country are making a great leap forward in the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation,&quot; said North Korea&#39;s state news agency, Korean Central News Agency.

CNN&#39;s Matthew Chance said that Moscow said Russian equipment in the area had confirmed an underground test.

Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said that the force of the blast was five to 15 kilotons.

In Washington, White House Press Secretary Tony Snow said a &quot;North Korean nuclear test would constitute a provocative act in defiance of the will of the international community and of our call to refrain from actions that would aggravate tensions in northeast Asia.&quot; (Watch initial Pentagon reaction -- 3:22)

A U.S. military official told CNN that &quot;something clearly has happened,&quot; but the Pentagon was working to fully confirm the report.

The U.S. Geological Survey Web site recorded a light 4.2-magnitude earthquake in North Korea at 10:35 a.m., about 385 kilometers (240 miles) northeast of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.

&quot;The nuclear test was conducted with indigenous wisdom and technology 100 percent. It marks a historic event as it greatly encouraged and pleased the KPA (Korean People&#39;s Army) and people that have wished to have powerful self-reliant defense capability,&quot; KCNA reported.

&quot;It will contribute to defending the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the area around it.&quot;
China&#39;s reaction

China on Monday demanded Pyongyang stop any action that would worsen the situation, Reuters news service reports.

&quot;The DPRK has ignored the widespread opposition of the international community and conducted a nuclear test brazenly on October 9,&quot; China&#39;s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its Web site.

&quot;The Chinese government is firmly opposed to this,&quot; the statement said.

In Tokyo, the prime minister&#39;s office said Japan had established a task force to address the situation. Chief government spokesman Yasuhisa Shiozaki said if a nuclear test was confirmed, Japan would &quot;strongly protest&quot; it.

Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned the claimed test, Russian news agencies reported, as Russia demanded North Korea rein in its nuclear program.

On Friday, the Security Council warned North Korea against performing a nuclear test, citing unspecified action if it should do so.
South Korean tapped for top U.N. role

The Security Council also has called on North Korea to return immediately to six-party talks with China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States.

The United States and its allies have been urging North Korea to rejoin the talks aimed at persuading the reclusive Communist nation to abandon its nuclear arms program.

South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-Moon was formally nominated by the U.N. Security Council on Monday to be the next U.N. secretary-general.

The nomination will go to the 192-member General Assembly the coming week for expected approval. The new secretary-general&#39;s term is to begin January 2007.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea denounced U.N. sanctions as a declaration of war on Tuesday, while across the border in Seoul an official said there were signs the reclusive Communist state may be preparing for a second nuclear test.
<p>Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov said he did not exclude the possibility that Pyongyang would detonate another nuclear device, a step Washington’s top official on North Korea warned would be considered a “belligerent act”.</p>
<p>Defiant in the face of sanctions backed by even its closest ally, China, Pyongyang said it had withstood international pressure before and so was hardly likely to yield now that it had become “a nuclear weapons state”.</p>
<p>“The DPRK had remained unfazed in any storm and stress in the past when it had no nuclear weapons,” official media quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. "It is quite nonsensical to expect the DPRK to yield to the pressure and threat of someone at this time when it has become a nuclear weapons state.</p>
<p>“The DPRK wants peace but is not afraid of war,” the spokesman said, referring to the country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).</p>
<p>The U.S. government on Monday confirmed the October 9 underground blast was a nuclear explosion, as Pyongyang claimed.</p>
<p>The New York Times said the explosion was most likely not fuelled by uranium, but rather by plutonium harvested from its small, mothballed nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>The report, quoting unnamed officials, suggests fears that Pyongyang had developed a uranium programme based on equipment and know-how from Pakistan were unfounded.</p>
<p>U.S. news networks NBC and ABC said spy satellites had spotted what may be preparations for another nuclear test.</p>
<p>There was no official confirmation, but a South Korean official who asked not to be named said the government was making preparations “with the possibility of a second test in mind”, and Russia’s Ivanov said another detonation could not be ruled out.</p>
<p>“Russia’s reaction in that case would be exactly the same as it was to the first nuclear explosion – that is, negative,” Ivanov told reporters.</p>
<p>“BELLIGERENT”</p>
<p>A U.N. Security Council resolution agreed last weekend imposed sanctions that are mostly aimed at choking off the country’s weapons programmes.</p>
<p>U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, speaking to reporters after crisis talks in South Korea, warned Pyongyang it would head deeper into isolation it if conducted another test.</p>
<p>“We would all regard a second test as a belligerent answer on North Korea’s part to the international community,” he said. "The DPRK really has to understand that the international community is not going to accept the DPRK as a nuclear state.</p>
<p>"I think the DPRK is under some impression that once they make nuclear tests that somehow we will respect them more. The fact of the matter is nuclear tests make us respect them less.</p>
<p>European Union foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg also demanded that North Korea refrain from further nuclear tests and urged it commit itself to a moratorium on missile launches.</p>
<p>Japan’s Kyodo news agency, quoting a government official, said Chinese President Hu Jintao had voiced concern about how the U.N. sanctions are applied.</p>
<p>“Things must be done in such a way that they don’t bring about an escalation of the situation into something uncontrollable,” Hu told a visiting group of Japanese lawmakers.</p>
<p>China’s worries about the possible collapse of an impoverished and highly militarised state on its border has prompted concern it may not rigorously enforce the sanctions.</p>
<p>However, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said Beijing, as a permanent member of the Security Council, always strictly enforced its resolutions.</p>
<p>U.S. Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns said on Monday that China was already checking goods crossing into North Korea.</p>
<p>Liu declined to comment on Japanese media reports that China was halting some remittances to Pyongyang through its state bank.</p>
<p>Hill will be followed to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza, who is due to arrive in Tokyo on Wednesday on a visit that will also include Seoul, Beijing and Moscow.</p>
<p>Officials say Rice will seek a unified approach to Pyongyang and a restart of six-party talks, the now-dormant forum aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions.</p>

              <blockquote>WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Bush on Monday said North Korea's claim that it has tested a nuclear weapon is a threat to international peace and said the world "will respond."
<p>“The transfer of nuclear weapons to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States,” Bush said. “And we would hold North Korea fully accountable to the consequences of such action.”</p>
<p>Bush said the U.S. was still trying to confirm whether North Korea had actually tested a nuclear weapon as it claimed earlier Monday.</p>
<p>He said he’d spoken with the leaders of South Korea, Russia, China and Japan.</p>
<p>“All of us agreed that the proclaimed actions taken by North Korea are unacceptable and deserve an immediate response by the United Nations Security Council,” Bush said. (Transcript)</p>
<p>China, a close ally of North Korea, denounced the claimed test as “brazen,” and South Korea said it would respond “sternly” to a move that experts said raised fears of nuclear terrorism and a regional arms race.</p>
<p>North Korea’s ambassador to the U.N. Pak Kil-yon said the council should “congratulate” North Korea’s scientists and researchers “instead of [issuing] such notorious, useless and reckless resolutions or whatever the statement against” North Korea.</p>
<p>Pak said the test was “very, very successful” and will contribute “to the maintenance and guarantee of peace and security in the peninsula and the region.”</p>
<p>When asked if North Korea plans to conduct further tests, Pak told reporters “that will be enough, you don’t think so?”</p>
<p>Bush said North Korea “remains one of the world’s leading proliferators of missile technology, including transfers to Iran and Syria.”</p>
<p>When North Korea warned last week that it intended to conduct a nuclear test, international analysts said it could unleash a regional arms race and give a virtual green light to Iran, which the United States suspects wants to develop nuclear weapons. Experts also fear North Korea may allow terrorists such as al Qaeda access to its nuclear weapons technology.</p>
<p>“This immediately affects the calculations of South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, all of whom might decide that they need to have their own independent nuclear arsenal as well,” said international security analyst Joseph Cirincione of the Center for American Progress. “If North Korea gets away with this, Iran will be encouraged to go forward.”</p>
<p>If confirmed, the test would be the first of its kind since Pakistan detonated an underground nuclear weapon in May of 1998, said Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. North Korea would be the eighth nation to successfully conduct such a test, he said.</p>
<p>North Korea has recently test fired seven missiles, including a long-range ballistic missile in July, but it’s unknown whether Pyongyang possesses the high-technology expertise to construct a nuclear weapon small enough for a missile delivery system.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill said, “North Korea can have a future or it can have these weapons. It cannot have both.”</p>
<p>Immediately following North Korea’s announcement Monday, South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun said Pyongyang has “broke the trust of the international community.” (Watch South Korea’s Cabinet meet about what to do next – 7:00)</p>
<p>Roh said it brought “a severe situation that threatens stability on the Korean Peninsula and in northeast Asia.”</p>
<p>Abe told the same news conference his country would work “to make ways to implement action for a tough resolution.”</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard suggested financial, trade and travel sanctions, saying a “strong international response is called for.”</p>
<p>CNN’s Dan Rivers, speaking from the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, said the key question now was what China – which effectively allowed North Korea to exist economically – would do. (Watch a quick timeline of how the situation reached this point – 2:09)</p>
<p>The apparent nuclear test was conducted at 10:36 a.m. (1:36 a.m. GMT) in Hwaderi near Kilju city, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported, citing defense officials.</p>
<p>South Korea’s state geology research center detected a 3.58-magnitude “artificial earthquake” in a remote area of North Korea’s North Hamgyeong Province, according to the news agency. Judging from the seismic tremor, the center said the power of the explosion was equivalent to around a half kiloton of TNT explosives, Yonhap reported.</p>
<p>Reports of the claimed test triggered global condemnation (Full story).</p>
<p>South Korea’s Defense Ministry raised the military alert level. (Watch how the world changes after a North Korean nuclear test – 2:09)</p>
<p>“The field of scientific research in the DPRK (North Korea’s official name) successfully conducted an underground nuclear test under secure conditions on October 9. … at a stirring time when all the people of the country are making a great leap forward in the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation,” said North Korea’s state news agency, Korean Central News Agency.</p>
<p>CNN’s Matthew Chance said that Moscow said Russian equipment in the area had confirmed an underground test.</p>
<p>Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said that the force of the blast was five to 15 kilotons.</p>
<p>In Washington, White House Press Secretary Tony Snow said a “North Korean nuclear test would constitute a provocative act in defiance of the will of the international community and of our call to refrain from actions that would aggravate tensions in northeast Asia.” (Watch initial Pentagon reaction – 3:22)</p>
<p>A U.S. military official told CNN that “something clearly has happened,” but the Pentagon was working to fully confirm the report.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey Web site recorded a light 4.2-magnitude earthquake in North Korea at 10:35 a.m., about 385 kilometers (240 miles) northeast of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.</p>
<p>“The nuclear test was conducted with indigenous wisdom and technology 100 percent. It marks a historic event as it greatly encouraged and pleased the KPA (Korean People’s Army) and people that have wished to have powerful self-reliant defense capability,” KCNA reported.</p>
<p>“It will contribute to defending the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the area around it.”<br>
China’s reaction</p>
<p>China on Monday demanded Pyongyang stop any action that would worsen the situation, Reuters news service reports.</p>
<p>“The DPRK has ignored the widespread opposition of the international community and conducted a nuclear test brazenly on October 9,” China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its Web site.</p>
<p>“The Chinese government is firmly opposed to this,” the statement said.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the prime minister’s office said Japan had established a task force to address the situation. Chief government spokesman Yasuhisa Shiozaki said if a nuclear test was confirmed, Japan would “strongly protest” it.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned the claimed test, Russian news agencies reported, as Russia demanded North Korea rein in its nuclear program.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Security Council warned North Korea against performing a nuclear test, citing unspecified action if it should do so.<br>
South Korean tapped for top U.N. role</p>
<p>The Security Council also has called on North Korea to return immediately to six-party talks with China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States.</p>
<p>The United States and its allies have been urging North Korea to rejoin the talks aimed at persuading the reclusive Communist nation to abandon its nuclear arms program.</p>
<p>South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-Moon was formally nominated by the U.N. Security Council on Monday to be the next U.N. secretary-general.</p>
<p>The nomination will go to the 192-member General Assembly the coming week for expected approval. The new secretary-general’s term is to begin January 2007.</p>
