    <description> Hello all, I would like to add some crowns to chat for hybrid pvp v3... I know its client sided and in client.java, but where do i edit them at? I&#39;ve searched every where for this and I simply can&#39;t find it... I would greatly appreciate it if someone helped me out here. I have the crowns I want to use.
Thanks and Kind Regards
