    <description>[center][size=14pt]Kill Everyone Online[/size][/center]

[center]K.E.O is a project in the making. The goal is to replicate the original &quot;pking&quot; that we all love. [/center]

[center][b]Current Features[/b][/center]
[center]
-GameEngine
-World
-Tasks
-PacketHandler
-Log In (Temp)
[/center]


[center][b]Plans[/b][/center]

The server exp rate will be semi high. It should take only a few days to max. Same with the drop rates. The drop rates will be aimed to replicate the original st()rkpk. No stat changer. If you want a pure you make a pure.

              <p>RSCDEF was just a proof of concept. But I really agree with you, veer, it has quite a bunch of flaws. The reason is, I never intended to host a server for the public (because I don’t have time to deal with users and their many problems), so I decided to go with the easier thread-per-client approach.</p>
<p>The three main reasons, why I see RSCDEF has lower latency compared to RSCD, is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What you said, veer, the incoming data is read more frequently than the client updating is performed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “circular buffer” implementation for events. It never has to remove any events, as it just adds new ones on top of others. It may not be like some of the well known implementations, but they are pretty similar none the less. I actually came up with the idea on my own, as I had never heard of the concept “circular buffers” when I made it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The area system. As far as I know, the concept had never been used by anyone at the time I made it (2007 - 2008). So it was pretty new aswell. It wasn’t finished though.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another major flaw I see, would be the overall architecture. Or, should I say, the lack thereof? Also, today I’d prefer to create many smaller sub-projects instead of one larger. I’d use the methodology DDD and SpringFrameworks IoC (or some other IoC container - it really doesn’t matter). I would also add Aspects (via AspectJ or similar) for transaction management and logging etc.</p>

<p>I’d imagine most people actually don’t know how to fix the “problems”, as evidenced by the fact nobody has fixed them. There are <em>plenty</em> of things in the servers today that can ruin scalability and performance. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>That being said, there is not quite a performance-speed trade-off here. Both RSCD and RSCDEF have noticeable flaws; the idea I proposed, however, avoids these.</p>

              <p>Your main, erm…, /beef/ is with the way that RSCD inherently servers work, right? You want something seemingly more immediate, no?<br>
You shouldn’t need to advocate the /naive/ approach RSCDEF took. Whether you recognize it or not, the bottleneck is how RSCD and it’s derived servers function on a set cycle.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If the server receives a frame from a client, for example one involving attacking an entity, it is decoded asynchronously by the networking library (<em>usually</em> MINA, although some are attempting to optimize in favor of Netty). Afterwards, it is pushed into a queue along with the frames being received by all other clients.</p>
<p>The bottleneck lies here: the queue. Many times you’ll find a typical iteration of the server cycle takes less time than the 500ms it subscribes to. Indeed, during this time, received frames are simply queued and queued and queued. The point of contention is the delayed queuing until the next cycle as opposed to handling immediately.</p>
<p>The solution lies in understanding what exactly the server cycle is meant to do. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Look at RSCDEF; the reason it can respond to such interactions so quickly is that it does no queuing of frames. Instead, every 50ms, it goes through a process which checks to see if any data is available to be read from the client’s socket. If there is indeed data, it reads and decodes it on the spot.</p>
<p>This is much more immediate than the solution taking place in RSCD, where instead, data is read and decoded asynchronously and ultimately queued for serial handling every 500ms. Why do we use asynchronous I/O, then? Isn’t the point that we do not impose such waits… I mean, it <em>is</em> called non-blocking I/O, right? :rolleyes:<br>
To be honest, this cycle rate is merely something you /chose/. Most people just chose 500ms as it seemed optimal. Optimal for what, though?</p>
<p>What /valid/ reason is there to unnecessarily queue this data up until the next 500ms, when RSCDEF does fine waiting only 50ms? Is there such a reason to using a cycle here… <em>at all</em>?</p>
<p>The answer is no; frankly, there isn’t.<br>
The true purpose of any such cycle is to coordinate synchronizing all clients at the same time, to prevent such issues as one client having a more up-to-date view of the world than another client.<br>
To use this cycle to restrict the time allocated to handle the incoming frames from the client is /also/ a very stupid and naive thing to do.</p>
<p>Imagine in RSCD your cycle takes, say, only 200ms. These next 300ms are spent doing nothing, while incoming frames from the clients continue to populate a queue. Indeed, 300ms of time that could have been spent handling these frames… were <em>not</em> used!<br>
:o</p>
<p>/Very/ embarrassing. Isn’t a much more rational solution, instead, to handle such frames as immediately as possible? To avoid this /unnecessary/ waste of 300ms when it could be used to process incoming events from the client? Indeed so; the cycle should remain what it was meant to do – coordinate synchronization of the state of the world with the clients. This should happen at your chosen rate, be it 500 or 600ms, or whatever. It should not be wasting CPU time and giving the delayed, artificially /latent/ feel you complain about. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>A few days ago, I came up with the idea to abandon these restraints where they have no use. Called by some the “cycle-free” model, your main thread would be continuously handling incoming frames and executing logic tasks, only to be /temporarily interrupted/ at a fixed frequency, replacing the old idea of a main cycle rate.<br>
Instead of losing that precious processing time with <em>long</em> interruptions, like the 300ms gap in the example, interruptions should instead be done to an “engine” processing incoming frames and executing domain logic tasks (encapsulated in RSCD’s “event” system) at this fixed frequency. Only during this <em>hopefully</em> small period of time would queuing really have time to build up, to keep the state of the game world consistent when synchronizing the clients; the rest of your time, however, is dedicated to being as immediate as possible.</p>
<p>Questions? Don’t be afraid to ask!<br>

<p>The server exp rate will be semi high. It should take only a few days to max. Same with the drop rates. The drop rates will be aimed to replicate the original st()rkpk. No stat changer. If you want a pure you make a pure.</p>
