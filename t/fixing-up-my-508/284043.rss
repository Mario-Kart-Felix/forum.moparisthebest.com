    <title>Fixing up my 508</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixing-up-my-508/284043</link>
    <description>Hey last weekend I opened up my server to the public after a couple of weeks of fixing it up. I knew there were problems with it but I did this to find out if there were anymore than i already knew of. Sure enough there was! So i have fixed some of it and some I need help with. This is what this topic is for. I wanted to know if anyone knew how to fix or know a tutorial to teach how to fix any of the following problems. I will edit this if I find more.

I know there&#39;s more than this, but of course, right when I go to make the thread my mind goes blank. I&#39;ll update this as I think of more.


[ul][li]Fixing Trading[/li]
[li]Range. When used it crashes everyones client.[/li]
[li]Accounts being reset.[/li]
[li]Drops not showing right away[/li][/ul]


About trading: I found many tutorials for fixing this. The problem is, When the trade screen comes up, your inventory is not able to be used. example: If you clicked / right clicked an item to offer, a box comes up but all it says is cancel instead of Offer 1, Offer 5, Offer 10, ect.

About range: It crashes everyones client. If you look in the client console it says clean: shutdown or something like that. It doesn&#39;t happen if you are ranging from 15 or more sqaures away from opponent.

About accounts: Everyone once in a while someones account will get reset to lvl 3 and all items deleted. It&#39;s happend many times now to many different people, including my own account.

About drops: When someone kills a monster the drop only shows to playerid 0 instead of the person who killed the monster. So to get their drop they have to wait 1 minutes for it to show up. 

In case you didn&#39;t notice the title it is a 508 server. It is also Bulby base.</description>

              <p>it USUALLY always saves their account. It just randomly happens to players like once every 3 days that it gets reset.</p>

              <p>Well, i don’t do 508+, but im guessing players getting restarted = you need a saving process.</p>

That would be great except I already did so much work to it I would rather fix these than start over.</p>
