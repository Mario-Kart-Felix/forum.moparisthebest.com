Note: There are plenty more things to the server, don&#39;t think I should continue this on and on, you should come and see everything for yourself. =]

*--We are here to make a great time for everyone that wishes to give us a chance as a server, and most people who do, stay for awhile. I know not everyone is going to like what we do or agree with what we do at every single situation, but we aim for complete fairness and enjoyment to all our players.

Thank you for viewing this, hope to see you on the server!!
