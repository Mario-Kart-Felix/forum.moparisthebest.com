    <title>Is it possible to make a webclient with this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-possible-to-make-a-webclient-with-this/422890</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using Ric&#39;s webclient tut. Now the client I&#39;m using isn&#39;t mine (its for a server I play on constantly.). I&#39;m trying to make a webclient for it and there is no client.java I decompiled the client.class and this is all that showed up:
[code]class
{
}
[/code]
What do I do with that?</description>

              <p>You cannot have a webclient without a functioning client. I recommend downloading a new client that has a working client.java for you to edit and compile.</p>
<p>EDIT: You are making this webclient for a server you don’t own? Do they know this? If not you are going to need to get the full client with the cache files/java files.</p>
