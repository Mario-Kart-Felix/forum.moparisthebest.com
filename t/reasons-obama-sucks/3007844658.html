<p>You found out my secret!</p>
<p>I see now that my post was a bit shortsighted. So let me elaborate:</p>
<p>I’m not a US resident. Which means that a patriot spreading his patriotic ideas annoys me. If the Netherlands would’ve been bigger, and therefore able to spread it’s ideology, you would be annoyed by us. This is the reason a big part of the world’s population hates the US: the US sees itself as superior, and wants to spread it’s ideology. It wants to spread its form of democracy, and some want to include Christianity with it. Most extreme patriots are Republicans. Democrats tend to be a little bit friendlier towards foreign nations. This attitude doesn’t fit in the ideas of Republicans. Republicans see Obama as a communist. They saw Kennedy as a Communist. But is Obama a communist?</p>
<p>Point 5 of Old Rsc Player’s post shows you another fact: Altough the US is a ‘free’ nation, a person with a middle name that is also used in Muslim nations must be a Muslim, according to many. With all the consequences. You call yourself free, but you don’t even have true freedom of religion. Muslims, Atheists, etc, are all looked upon as inferior. A free nation has church and politics separated, yet the church has a big influence on politics, and therefor it has a big influence on science.[/quote]<br>
With Obama we’re practically on thin ice with Fascism. And Christianity is the dominate religion but you are ALLOWED to believe what you want. Society may think otherwise.</p>

<p>lol’d “…Catching a <span class="bbcode-b">disease</span> like Breast Cancer…” fail.</p>
<p>He doesn’t understand that this joke he calls a ‘health care plan’, or ‘Obama-care’ has to be paid for, which will send us into more dept. AND IT WILL BE ILLEGAL FOR A INSURANCE PROVIDER TO DROP YOUR COVERAGE. So Mr. Obama, what happens exactly when those companies fold? And thousands of doctors are out of work? You’ve gone in the opposite direction than what you’ve ‘promised’ back in the last campaign.</p>

<p>The US government doesn’t (by far) control the business and it doesn’t repress criticism or opposition. AFAIK, (but correct me if I’m wrong) governors still have a lot to say in their own state, so there isn’t a truly centralized government either. So I don’t know how you come up with this.</p>

</aside>
<p>I will read up about the health care plan, but until then I will comment on it: In many European countries there are health care plans. Why? Because most people can hardly afford even a trip to hospital with an ambulance. In the Netherlands you can count on €6000,-. It’s even worse in the US, because Americans hardly save. If you have to pay your medical bills by yourself, you will have to lend the money for it. I’d rather pay €80 (€30 for me, as I’m a student) a month and get all the care I need, then pay over a €100 a month to repay my debt.</p>

<p>The US government doesn’t (by far) control the business and it doesn’t repress criticism or opposition. AFAIK, (but correct me if I’m wrong) governors still have a lot to say in their own state, so there isn’t a truly centralized government either. So I don’t know how you come up with this.[/quote]<br>

<p>Besides that, nationalizing banks isn’t an act of communism either. If all companies get nationalized, it’s communism. Nationalizing banks only means that the state buys a big chunk of shares, making it the biggest shareholder, or even the only shareholder.</p>

I am going to go out on a limb and state my idea behind this individual. He is a puppet controlled by extreme left who is also in control of all chambers of the govt and obviously media. His only talent is speaking (mostly of ‘change’ which doesn’t mean it’s positive); people buy into his message and give him power. I do honestly believe that he wants to destroy the country.</p>
<p>Take a look at who he surrounds himself with: someone who wants to give legal rights to farm animals, someone who believes the white man pollutes black neighborhoods, someone who believes in taking affirmative action into account in the supreme court, …<br>

Your a hard-ass republican. Admit it. You neglect every single thing about democrats, not considering anyone elses comments that support Obama or any democrats. And its kind of obvious that he’s already doing a better job considering outside countries can already tell and they don’t even live here.</p>
<p>The one thing I found good in Bush was that he help the citizens of Iraq (well <span class="bbcode-b">he</span> didn’t actually help), but the media basically covers up all that has done well in Iraq, because if it was “good”, no one will watch it.</p>
<p>Tbh, the media ruins us.</p>

I read the other sides views, i take them into consideration and i understand what they’re trying to do. If you’ve ever watched reps and dems argue the <span class="bbcode-b">Democrat</span> is usually the stubborn one who talks in circles.</p>
<pre><code>     Outside countries know what hes like and his attitude and what he wanted to do etc. And like RSC said many other countries run with the same plan but they don't understand that something like that is extremely hard to do in the US. If everyone has Health Care, the homeless will hurt themselves to be admitted to hospitals for free food and treatment. Someone with a legitimate injury could possibly not get urgent care and they would be screwed. An insurance provider cannot drop your coverage so when they stop getting money, they will close down and more people are out of insurance, doctors wont become paid and even more will be out of work. No one will want to invest $100k into medical training for how low its going to pay. After the speech a commercial came on about a Canadian woman who had a brain tumor, her government made her wait a very long time for treatment and she would have been dead if she hadn't came to America to get urgent surgery. The amazing thing is how it maintains itself with such a complex system that has worked for over a century and Obama's trying to change it to something he in his mind views as 'the right thing to do'. We do not have enough resources and doctors to support a nationalized health-care system, we cant even handle Medicare, Social Security, and post offices as we're piling on billions of dollars of depth a year with it. For example, the post office loses $8b a year, why don't we try to fix those programs before we create another one like health care? and Its not free. Those who wouldn't pay for it in the first place get it free, the rest of us are still paying. Yes, everyone should have coverage but he does not understand the long term effects this will have and whats right for the country.

<p>[quote=“R.I.P RSC, post:29, topic:300784”]Fascism != communism.</p>
<p>Besides that, nationalizing banks isn’t an act of communism either. If all companies get nationalized, it’s communism. Nationalizing banks only means that the state buys a big chunk of shares, making it the biggest shareholder, or even the only shareholder.[/quote]<br>
Sorry, it was an act of socialism*.</p>
<p>I also suggest watching this T4: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTKB9m_Dbs8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTKB9m_Dbs8</a></p>
<p>Obama is also trying to shut down shows like Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Orielly, Hannity etc. They’re pointing out facts about how Obama is lying, If these shows become shut down it is an act of communism IMO because he is preventing freedom of speech.</p>
<p>I also recommend all Americans here watch: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q5jm1um2No">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q5jm1um2No</a> It shows everything we’ve fought &amp; died for and accomplished and what it has come to. Obama does not realize people have done exactly what he wants to prevent in order for him to even be president right now.</p>
<p>To add on to that, After van jones was forced to resign for ADMITTING TO BEING A COMMUNIST. Republicans are now calling a hearing to review the other Czars for communist connections/beliefs.</p>
<p>Knew it.</p>

        <p>Frell, please never mention the word “communist” again before you do some actual research and learn about it. Freedom of speech can exist under communism, however under Soviet style communism it was limited. I am not going to even bother with the rest of your post, maybe later when I’m done with my work, but I have some quick things to point out:</p>
<ol>
<li>You say republicans are investigating “Czars” for communist beliefs. Do you know about the Romanov Dynasty? The Bolsheviks [later becoming the Communist Party of the Soviet Union] fought to overthrow the Tsars [synonym for Czars] of Russia.</li>
<li>[quote=“Frell, post:34, topic:300784”][quote author=yakman link=topic=397039.msg2952331#msg2952331 date=1252610746]<br>
Frell is full of shit anyway. As proved in other threads, he doesnt think he views through clearly, he doesnt understand them too well and I bet he only holds them because his parents do.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only problem is there’s one born every minute.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I seriously could care less, the majority of people in other countries only see him for what he campaigned for and not what hes doing now, which is practically the opposite of what he promised.</p>
<p>You’ve yet to give me a reason why im full of shit, you poke in and tell someone they’re wrong then leave. You’ve yet to support anything you say except for your atheism shit.</p>
<p>One person with common sense is born every minute.[/quote]<br>
Remember the Obama thread? I gave you proof of all widely recognized scientific communities coming to the consensus that humans affected climate change, and you did some “research” and came to the conclusion, without proof, that every single member of these organizations is corrupt and is lying about this to get money from the government, and that you are right, without having done any extensive research. I consider that a reason…</p>
<p>I don’t have a problem with you, I have a problem with the level of false information that you are spreading. In our country you are entitled to your beliefs, no matter how wrong they are, and I am entitled to my beliefs, no matter how extreme they are/how much I want to leave. However, freedom [which can be considered limited even in the US, but I’ll talk how I consider that possible later if requested] still has laws on defamation, libel and slander. I do not know these laws or what boundaries they have nor will I be looking them up at this moment.</p>
