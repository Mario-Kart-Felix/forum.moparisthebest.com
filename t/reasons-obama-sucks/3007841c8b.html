<p>It works small scale(and somewhat large scale if you want to count several countries in Europe), so why wouldn’t it work in the USA? …and why are you defending health insurance companies?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 28, 2009, 20:27:18[/size][hr]Sorry, I accidentally deleted the topic last night.</p>

<p>I mean, on such a small scale he’s already having delays for operations and appointments etc. That is because of a shortage of doctors. Sweden has 9 million people in it and the US has 400 million, a rare percentage become doctors so imagine what would happen.</p>

        <p>since sweden has less people, less people will become doctors because they need less.</p>
<p>since america has more people, more people will become doctors.</p>
<p>you said ‘percentage’ yourself, you said yourself that the same ratio of people would become doctors. so where exactly is the problem?</p>

        <p>For 9 million people lets say there’s 300k doctors. Sweden is a rich country so there aren’t very many poor people, this also factors in.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that in the US. Our poor to wealth ratio is alot worse that Sweden and the rest of Europe. And only so many people want to still become doctors.

<p>Health insurance companies are making way to big of a scam…They’re WAY overcharging, and making WAY to much money. Obama’s plan will contain a public option so people can choose if they want an insurance company, or government health care. Obviously, most people are going to choose government health care because they don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars a year on something that shouldn’t cost that much. Of course it comes out of taxes, but none the less, the government isn’t making any money off that sector.</p>

<p>Frell, I’m going to have to disagree with you. The government will have to do something about the insurance companies or have a health care system in place. My family making around a combines 80-90,000 a year will not be able to afford health insurance. My dad only has it because of a company he was in. When that runs out, we’re pretty much screwed.</p>
<p>Having the option of private or government health care would be best. Doctors and hospitals charge way too much, this is why we need some sort of plan in place. It’s either put a cap on what they can charge, or put a plan in place.</p>

<p>For 9 million people lets say there’s 300k doctors. Sweden is a rich country so there aren’t very many poor people, this also factors in.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that in the US. Our poor to wealth ratio is alot worse that Sweden and the rest of Europe. And only so many people want to still become doctors. In the US people are ignorant and greedy (not all, some. But still a great deal), they factor in for never becoming doctors. We are low on them as it is so if this healthcare bill is passed, it will need more and will create so many problems. People do not want to pay more for healthcare insurance, thats whats so great about insurance companies. Sure they rip you off, but at least you know you’re covered. When the government takes control you pay more for people who would never pay it and its a COMPLETE rip off.</p>

<p>Health insurance companies are making way to big of a scam…They’re WAY overcharging, and making WAY to much money. Obama’s plan will contain a public option so people can choose if they want an insurance company, or government health care. Obviously, most people are going to choose government health care because they don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars a year on something that shouldn’t cost that much. Of course it comes out of taxes, but none the less, the government isn’t making any money off that sector.</p>

        <p>[quote=“zoltanman, post:207, topic:300784”]Frell, I’m going to have to disagree with you. The government will have to do something about the insurance companies or have a health care system in place. My family making around a combines 80-90,000 a year will not be able to afford health insurance. My dad only has it because of a company he was in. When that runs out, we’re pretty much screwed.</p>
<p>Having the option of private or government health care would be best. Doctors and hospitals charge way too much, this is why we need some sort of plan in place. It’s either put a cap on what they can charge, or put a plan in place.[/quote]<br>
They do not charge to much, sure the government could pitch in a pay a certain % off but we do not need full blown nationalized healthcare. Its going to effect people who don’t want anything to do with it and thats when problems will arise. Do you know how much training these people go through to become doctors, and how much it costs? Sure if healthcare is nationalized there will be demand for doctors, but since the government pays them there’s a cap on how much money they can earn a year which destroys the incentive for many people.</p>
<p>Im not even going to bother will fellix, he’s probably the most ignorant person here and he obviously did not read any of the previous posts. Obama is trying to get rid of private insurance companies so the non poor HAVE to take part in covering others. We will have to pay 3x more than we do now and our coverage wont even get better, now thats a SCAM! If he allows private insurance companies they’re going to make a killing when everyone realizes that the government is the one ripping them off. Then we are stuck with the government paying for people out of they’re money and all the people who don’t want to pay for other people (Its not greedy, you can fuck off if you want to say that) with private insurance. This will inevitably throw us into more debt and goes against everything Obama has promised.</p>
<p>…do you even live in the US?</p>
<p>ps: i love how obama lies and says hes not giving coverage to illegal immigrants but the second they step into a hospital they’re covered, he leaves out information which doesn’t surprise me.</p>

<p>TBH, I’ve had about 4 operations on the NHS in NHS hospitals and they gave me perfect treatment everytime, allowing me to make a swift recovery. I also didn’t contract any illnesses or get fucked by an immigrant.</p>
