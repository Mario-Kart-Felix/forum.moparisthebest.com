<p>Take a look at who he surrounds himself with: someone who wants to give legal rights to farm animals, someone who believes the white man pollutes black neighborhoods, someone who believes in taking affirmative action into account in the supreme court, …[/quote]</p>
<p>Are all you Americans conspiracy theorists? The left wing thinks that the Bush admin. was behind 9/11, the right wing thinks Obama is trying to destroy the nation. Would you please shut the fuck up for one moment when Obama is talking and actually try to understand what he is saying? If you do, you can form your own opinion, rather then just copying the opinions of your parents and Farce Limbaugh and Bill O’Rly. I’m not saying I’d vote for Obama, but I would rather kill myself than vote for a Republican candidate. Is there a possibility to vote for nobody in the US, while still voting?</p>
<p>At your second paragraph: I don’t know who you are talking about, but IMO it doesn’t really matter what they think, as long as it doesn’t affect their jobs. If the guy who wants to give legal rights to farm animals is in control of the foreign policy, who cares?</p>
<p>[quote=“Frell, post:38, topic:300784”]If everyone has Health Care, the homeless will hurt themselves to be admitted to hospitals for free food and treatment.<br>
Someone with a legitimate injury could possibly not get urgent care and they would be screwed. An insurance provider cannot drop your coverage so when they stop getting money, they will close down and more people are out of insurance, doctors wont become paid and even more will be out of work. No one will want to invest $100k into medical training for how low its going to pay.[/quote]</p>
<p>In the Netherlands you are also forced to insure yourself. If you don’t pay, you get a visit from the ‘deurwaarder’    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huissier_de_justice" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huissier_de_justice</a>. They can force you to pay, otherwise they just take what they think is of enough value. The homeless pay for it, if they can’t they will be fined. They can’t pay that either, so they’ll be locked up. If they are put in the right program, they can fix up and become a regular citizen again.</p>

<p>Oh, I misunderstood, I thought that it was an unofficial title being tacked on as an insult, but wikipedia states otherwise. However, communism isn’t the same as a dictatorship, and there are many different variants of communism. And you cannot trust everything you learn in American schools about communism, as it is usually extremely biased.</p>

Actually, from what I have observed democrats want to assist you getting the fish, and republicans want to excommunicate you and steal your fish. Of course that is a harshly extreme viewpoint meant for humour, but that is pretty much the style which most republican media sources use to portray the political parties, minus the humour part.<br>
ps im writing all of this at 4:30 am so I might need to fix errors later.</p>

I mean, the way the constitution is written it cannot be done, that is why Obama claims its flawed and wants it to state what must be done. The US is capitalist and any other people with different beliefs are not allowed in office. Because like i said, America’s slogan is ‘Land of the opportunity’, if we go communist that will be completely false. You would have a cap on how much money you could have and loads of other crap to deal with.</p>

Im very confused by this statement but i think i understand. Czars in the US are a little different than the ones in Russia &amp; I think you’re saying they’re obviously communist/dictators. Obama calls them Czars, they were never called Czars by themselves. Again not very educated about communism because obv we don’t learn about it, except for the general meanings and rule… Which is like 5 or 6th grade.<br>
[/quote]<br>
And you cannot trust everything you learn in American schools about communism, as it is usually extremely biased.[/quote]<br>
There’s nothing to be biased about. They tell you how it works and how its different from our country and that’s it.</p>

I wouldn’t say he is out to destroy the country. Obviously this attitude would stand out and quickly become discovered. He really just doesn’t think about the long term effects of things hes doing. He doesn’t believe in companies making big money &amp; people being rich. He claims theirs to many poor people and wants to ‘spread the wealth’. Even though they have worked almost all their lives for the money, so he wants to fundamentally change the way the US works. Limiting businesses to profits is an act of socialism.</p>
<p>The Obama committee destroys incentives. Why would you want to take a risk with your personal wealth when the government is just going to take the profit? People won’t do it, which will create a loss of jobs because no one will open businesses.</p>
<p>Democrats want to give fish away, Republicans want to teach you to fish. Its the land of opportunity for a reason, you HAVE that opportunity to become a millionaire and its pointless when the government ruins that. Why try?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Actually, from what I have observed democrats want to assist you getting the fish, and republicans want to excommunicate you and steal your fish. Of course that is a harshly extreme viewpoint meant for humour, but that is pretty much the style which most republican media sources use to portray the political parties, minus the humour part.<br>
ps im writing all of this at 4:30 am so I might need to fix errors later.[/quote]<br>
The problems is, if the Democrats ‘Assist you’ people will think they wont have to do it themselves. So that is why republicans want to ‘teach’ you, so you’re fed for life.</p>

I am going to go out on a limb and state my idea behind this individual. He is a puppet controlled by extreme left who is also in control of all chambers of the govt and obviously media. His only talent is speaking (mostly of ‘change’ which doesn’t mean it’s positive); people buy into his message and give him power. I do honestly believe that he wants to destroy the country.</p>
<p>Take a look at who he surrounds himself with: someone who wants to give legal rights to farm animals, someone who believes the white man pollutes black neighborhoods, someone who believes in taking affirmative action into account in the supreme court, …<br>

<p>Are all you Americans conspiracy theorists? The left wing thinks that the Bush admin. was behind 9/11, the right wing thinks Obama is trying to destroy the nation. Would you please shut the fuck up for one moment when Obama is talking and actually try to understand what he is saying? If you do, you can form your own opinion, rather then just copying the opinions of your parents and Farce Limbaugh and Bill O’Rly. I’m not saying I’d vote for Obama, but I would rather kill myself than vote for a Republican candidate. Is there a possibility to vote for nobody in the US, while still voting?</p>
<p>At your second paragraph: I don’t know who you are talking about, but IMO it doesn’t really matter what they think, as long as it doesn’t affect their jobs. If the guy who wants to give legal rights to farm animals is in control of the foreign policy, who cares?</p>

If everyone has Health Care, the homeless will hurt themselves to be admitted to hospitals for free food and treatment.<br>
Someone with a legitimate injury could possibly not get urgent care and they would be screwed. An insurance provider cannot drop your coverage so when they stop getting money, they will close down and more people are out of insurance, doctors wont become paid and even more will be out of work. No one will want to invest $100k into medical training for how low its going to pay. [/quote]</p>
<p>In the Netherlands you are also forced to insure yourself. If you don’t pay, you get a visit from the ‘deurwaarder’    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huissier_de_justice" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huissier_de_justice</a>. They can force you to pay, otherwise they just take what they think is of enough value. The homeless pay for it, if they can’t they will be fined. They can’t pay that either, so they’ll be locked up. If they are put in the right program, they can fix up and become a regular citizen again.</p>

While the economy is constricting it does make it harder without raises taxes, but the loans that are going to come as a result to new business and infrastructure will create new tax revenue streams, which can then be used to pay the debt without raising taxes.</p>

<p>That seems a bit odd… the republican viewpoint is that people are too stupid to understand the democrats assistance is  just assistance, but they also think people are smart enough to learn and be self sustained for life… we are both being extreme on this viewpoint, though.
