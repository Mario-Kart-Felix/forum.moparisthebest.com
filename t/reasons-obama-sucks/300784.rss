    <description>Do you agree?

If you have any more add them to the list.



1. The Race Card: Whether it be in suggesting that anyone who doesn’t vote for him because he is black is probably a republican, or in blaming Bush administration racism on a slow response to Hurricane Katrina, Obama is quite comfortable playing the race card.

2. Anti-Indian: After the Obama campaign released a paper disparaging other candidates for their ties to the Indian-American community, the chairman of the bipartisan US India Political Action Committee, Sanjay Puri, stated that the Obama Campaign was “engaging in the worst kind of anti-Indian American stereotyping.” Of course, Obama denied any hand in the racist document put out by his campaign.

3. Corrupt Buddies: Tony Rezko, a long time friend and fund-raiser for Obama, was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business. When asked about his friend, Obama said, “I’ve never done any favors for him.” This turned out to be a lie, as evidence turned up proving that Obama had written letters to city and state officials praising Rezko’s business practices.

4. Wal-Mart Ties: While bashing of Wal-Mart’s labor practices in public, Obama has been profiting from their business through the money his wife made as a member of the board of directors for a company that produces food for the mega-corporation.

5. Religious Ties: Is Obama a Muslim? Is he a Christian? Nobody is 100% sure, but it is true that Obama was raised in a Muslim family and at one time attended an Islamic school. He currently claims to be a convert to Christianity, but some are concerned about his Muslim upbringing.

6. Anti-Second Amendment: Obama is one of the most anti-Second Amendment legislators in the country. He supports a ban the sale or transfer of all forms of semi-automatic weapons.

7. Gas-guzzler: Obama might attack American automakers for not making enough environmental friendly automobiles, but when he goes home he drives a gas-guzzling V-8 hemi-powered Chrysler 300.

8. Obama Ringtones: The most annoying campaign tool ever.

9. Obama Girl: I take back what I said about the ringtones. This girl is far more annoying.

10. His Unelectable Name: Barack Hussein Obama, ’nuff said</description>

<p>TBH, I’ve had about 4 operations on the NHS in NHS hospitals and they gave me perfect treatment everytime, allowing me to make a swift recovery. I also didn’t contract any illnesses or get fucked by an immigrant.</p>

              <p>[quote=“zoltanman, post:207, topic:300784”]Frell, I’m going to have to disagree with you. The government will have to do something about the insurance companies or have a health care system in place. My family making around a combines 80-90,000 a year will not be able to afford health insurance. My dad only has it because of a company he was in. When that runs out, we’re pretty much screwed.</p>
<p>Having the option of private or government health care would be best. Doctors and hospitals charge way too much, this is why we need some sort of plan in place. It’s either put a cap on what they can charge, or put a plan in place.[/quote]<br>
They do not charge to much, sure the government could pitch in a pay a certain % off but we do not need full blown nationalized healthcare. Its going to effect people who don’t want anything to do with it and thats when problems will arise. Do you know how much training these people go through to become doctors, and how much it costs? Sure if healthcare is nationalized there will be demand for doctors, but since the government pays them there’s a cap on how much money they can earn a year which destroys the incentive for many people.</p>
<p>Im not even going to bother will fellix, he’s probably the most ignorant person here and he obviously did not read any of the previous posts. Obama is trying to get rid of private insurance companies so the non poor HAVE to take part in covering others. We will have to pay 3x more than we do now and our coverage wont even get better, now thats a SCAM! If he allows private insurance companies they’re going to make a killing when everyone realizes that the government is the one ripping them off. Then we are stuck with the government paying for people out of they’re money and all the people who don’t want to pay for other people (Its not greedy, you can fuck off if you want to say that) with private insurance. This will inevitably throw us into more debt and goes against everything Obama has promised.</p>
<p>…do you even live in the US?</p>
<p>ps: i love how obama lies and says hes not giving coverage to illegal immigrants but the second they step into a hospital they’re covered, he leaves out information which doesn’t surprise me.</p>

<p>Health insurance companies are making way to big of a scam…They’re WAY overcharging, and making WAY to much money. Obama’s plan will contain a public option so people can choose if they want an insurance company, or government health care. Obviously, most people are going to choose government health care because they don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars a year on something that shouldn’t cost that much. Of course it comes out of taxes, but none the less, the government isn’t making any money off that sector.</p>

<p>you said ‘percentage’ yourself, you said yourself that the same ratio of people would become doctors. so where exactly is the problem?</p>

<p>I mean, on such a small scale he’s already having delays for operations and appointments etc. That is because of a shortage of doctors. Sweden has 9 million people in it and the US has 400 million, a rare percentage become doctors so imagine what would happen.</p>

So i am more than qualified to discuss this issue. The government will never make a speech saying ‘uhh we’re kinda havin problems with healthcare n stuff but dont worry.’ So how will he know that his healthcare system wont collapse tomorrow? So he cannot say its working 100%.</p>
<p>Although i do agree that it would be working rather well in Sweden as they don’t pay alot for their national security and other countries pay for the military expenses, nor do they take part in international military obligations. With that much money and so little people a healthcare system like that wouldn’t be a problem at all.</p>

Yes, everyone should have healthcare and 85% of Americans do. We even discussed how you have to be helped if you are in need of urgent health and you’re rarely slapped with a debt. Obama’s healthcare bill will only mess up the near perfect system we have now. People who already pay and do fine will have to pay 3x more which people do not want to do. As it is they do not get enough for what they pay for and if this bill is passed they will be paying more for what they had before which isn’t the best. The homeless will hurt themselves deliberately to become admitted to hospitals for free food and there will no longer be enough rooms, doctors, or hospitals for people with legit injuries. Incentive to become a doctor will be destroyed. And for such a complex and large country something like this can never work, it barely works/worked in Europe and does not need to be done again. This is why not many people agree with Obama, he is trying to do what past history shows will fail.</p>
<p>In the end this bill will be a problematic solution to a non existing problem.<br>

That’s a personal assumption, what exactly are you basing this on?</p>
