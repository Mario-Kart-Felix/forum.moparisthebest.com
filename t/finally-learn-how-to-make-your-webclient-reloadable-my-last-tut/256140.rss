    <title>Finally Learn How To Make Your Webclient Reloadable (My Last Tut)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/finally-learn-how-to-make-your-webclient-reloadable-my-last-tut/256140</link>
    <description>I have been here now for a few years, I have wrote many tutorials, helped many people, and tried to spread my thoughts on &quot;spamming&quot;, &quot;unconstructive arguing&quot;, &quot;leeching&quot; and &quot;double posting&quot;, I hope I have made a change in this community and I hope the change is appreciated. As my last tutorial, This will also be my shortest, and most useful. If you post it will be appreciated ;) I would also like to say thank you to a few people for helping me over the years:
-Mod Taharok (Taharok):  Wrote the guide that i finally learned how to set up my first ever testscape based server.
-Melissa T: A great community member, I missed you greatly when you left.
-Silabsoft:  For creating that webclient which inspired me.
-LeScape Pkz: We had our differences in the past, but hopefully we can forget them.
-TellyNubby and yz78racer: FUCK YOU! (lol)
-Saad: My best friend, he advertised tobiasscape for me on mscp forums and got ip banned for me!
-Ninja Richi &amp; Mod Hawt: Forever faithful. I will miss you greatly.
-Danny, Colin, Josh, Corey, Gavin, Alfie &amp; Jeff: My irl friends who helped me with and played ts.

[b]IF YOU LOCK THIS I DON&#39;T GIVE A SQUIRT OF PISS! PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS AND WILL USE IT WHEN ITS LOCKED AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHITHOLE LIST OF SO-CALLED TUTORIALS![/b]

TUTORIAL:

Ok, well I released this in downloads section by accident one day, but that post has since died and I want everyone to know, and not just the people who were looking to download a server.

For years people have been using 317 webclients on ordinary web pages, and when their users refresh the page, they get some dumb ass error. The fix for this is simple.

What happens when your 317 webclient loads:

-signed_Clientname.jar is saved to the user&#39;s Temporary Internet Cache for faster veiwing
-The next time the page is loaded in the same session, it tries to boot up the client from the already downloaded jar file,
which doesn&#39;t work.

There is two lines of php code which you can use to delete all files from this &quot;Temporary Internet Cache&quot;, meaning every time you refresh the page, a new jar file is downloaded and used, which will mean it will load up perfectly!

Step 1: Change your webclient play page&#39;s extension to .php
Step 2: Paste these two lines of code at the VERY TOP of the file (above &lt;HTML&gt;)
[code]&lt;? header(&quot;Pragma: no-cache&quot;);
header(&quot;Cache: no-cache&quot;); ?&gt;[/code]
Step 3: Upload to a php enabled host. (Most webhosts are now adays.)
Step 4: Hayup, time to party :D

You need a permenant ip ban from MSCP forums, to allow you to get a life. (oj) :L<br>
Edit: And I just realised, NICE COMMUNICATION SKILLS!<br>
[/quote]Coming from the guy who told me to fuck off? I need the IP ban? Let’s think about this one, shall we? Anyway, I was feeling generous and kind at the time.[/quote]<br>
I’ve talked to a lot of people who agree with me when I say you need an IP ban, but that’s not really the point of this topic is it? It’s to teach people there is an alternative to the rs loader if you want to refresh the page and the you want the webclient to load up the same. Silab was brief, but so what at least she was constructive, which is why she got thanks from me and I appreciate her post all the same.<br>
Oh and I suppose if you could you probably would ip ban someone for saying “fuck off”, but thats how you entertain yourself so whatever floats your boat fuck-tard.</p>

              <p>I have been here now for a few years, I have wrote many tutorials, helped many people, and tried to spread my thoughts on “spamming”, “unconstructive arguing”, “leeching” and “double posting”, I hope I have made a change in this community and I hope the change is appreciated. As my last tutorial, This will also be my shortest, and most useful. If you post it will be appreciated <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I would also like to say thank you to a few people for helping me over the years:<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">IF YOU LOCK THIS I DON’T GIVE A SQUIRT OF PISS! PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS AND WILL USE IT WHEN ITS LOCKED AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHITHOLE LIST OF SO-CALLED TUTORIALS!</span></p>
<p>TUTORIAL:</p>
<p>Ok, well I released this in downloads section by accident one day, but that post has since died and I want everyone to know, and not just the people who were looking to download a server.</p>
<p>For years people have been using 317 webclients on ordinary web pages, and when their users refresh the page, they get some dumb ass error. The fix for this is simple.</p>
<p>What happens when your 317 webclient loads:</p>
<p>-signed_Clientname.jar is saved to the user’s Temporary Internet Cache for faster veiwing<br>
-The next time the page is loaded in the same session, it tries to boot up the client from the already downloaded jar file,<br>
which doesn’t work.</p>
<p>There is two lines of php code which you can use to delete all files from this “Temporary Internet Cache”, meaning every time you refresh the page, a new jar file is downloaded and used, which will mean it will load up perfectly!</p>
<p>Step 1: Change your webclient play page’s extension to .php<br>
Step 2: Paste these two lines of code at the VERY TOP of the file (above )</p>
<p><code>&lt;? header("Pragma: no-cache");
header("Cache: no-cache"); ?&gt;</code><br>
Step 3: Upload to a php enabled host. (Most webhosts are now adays.)<br>
Step 4: Hayup, time to party <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
