    <description>So i am supposed to make a game called nim in java and im stuck at the point where i have the board outputted and i have to have everything from the text file put into an array list. here&#39;s what its supposed to be THE GUIDELINES FOR THIS PROGRAM

Originally, there are three sets of stones, 3 in the first row, 4 in the second row and 7 in the third row. Each player, in turn, can take as many stones as they want, as long as they are in the same row AND they are consecutive (can’t take two stones not next to each other) The last person to take a stone is the loser. Using a 3x7 array, create a version of the game of Nim for two players. Each player should be able to specify the row, starting stone and how many stones they want to take. This program will take all of its input from a text file called nim.txt. In the text file, each line represents a move. A move is defined by three numbers, separated by commas (row, start, # to take). All moves from the text file should be read into an ArrayList at the opening of the program. Play is to continue down the list of moves until there is a winner. If a move is not valid, the next move should be assigned to the same player. The output of the program should state whether each move (numbered is valid or not) and finally, state the winner. No more moves should be assessed once there is a winner.

what goes in the text file is this, nim.txt is the file name
1,2,2
2,2,2
3,2,6
1,4,1
1,1,1
2,1,2
2,1,1
2,4,1
3,1,1

then this is what should happen in the program
Move     Valid         Player      Board
1,2,2     Valid         P1           0--
                                         0000
                                         0000000

2,2,2     Valid         P2           0--
                                         0--0
                                         0000000

3,2,6     Valid         P1          0--
                                        00--0
                                        0------

1,4,1    Invalid        P2         No change

1,1,1    Valid           P2         ---
                                        0--0
                                        0------

2,1,2    Invalid         P1        No change

2,1,1    Valid           P1        ---
                                       ---0
                                       0------

2,4,1    Valid           P2        ---
                                       ----
                                       0-------

3,1,1    Valid           P1        ---
                                       ----
                                       -------

The output of the program should look like this
Output
P1 Valid
P2 Valid
P1 Valid
P2 Invalid
P2 Valid
P1 Invalid
P1 Valid
P2 Valid
P1 Valid
P2 WINS!!

The code i have right now is this
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NimGame {

	/**
	 * @param args
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args)throws IOException {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner reader = new Scanner (new File(&quot;nim.txt&quot;));
		ArrayList &lt;String&gt; moves = new ArrayList &lt;String&gt;();
		while(reader.hasNext()){
			String moves1 = reader.nextLine();
			moves.add(moves1);
			//System.out.println(moves1);
		}
		
		 int[][] nimBoard = { { 0,0,0 }, { 0,0,0,0 }, { 0,0,0,0,0,0,0 }};
		 for (int i = 0; i &lt; nimBoard.length; i++) {
			 for (int j = 0; j &lt; nimBoard[i].length; j++) {
	                System.out.print(nimBoard[i][j]);
	         }
	            System.out.println();
	     }
	}
}
PLEASE HELP ME I NEED IT BADLY. Ive been working at this program for days now and keep coming up with errors and its getting me no where</description>
