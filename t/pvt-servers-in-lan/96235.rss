    <title>PVT servers in LAN</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pvt-servers-in-lan/96235</link>
    <description>Hello all.. :D

I want to go bigger today, I want to know if it is possible to make a Private server work in a LAN (Local Area Network) which means the server will not be open to the internet only for a local network...I believe this can be made but not easily (&quot;Impossible&quot; isn&#39;t in  my dictionary, ;)) if you think you can help post, If i see properly I will give you more info to stay in contact :cool:

I work with networking 24/7 so you don&#39;t need to break your head with net i will take care of it...just need help with the code  ;)</description>
