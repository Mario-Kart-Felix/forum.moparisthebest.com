    <description>THANKS &lt;WHATEVER YOU&#39;RE NAME IS:rolleyes:&gt; (THE GUY WHO CREATES IMP ARYAN)!!! IT WORKS!!!
OH YEAH JUST GOT IT [b][i][u][glow=red,2,300]ruler[/glow][/u][/i][/b], I am not worthy enough to say you&#39;re name!

&lt;MAJOR EDIT:&gt;

runescape updated 2nd time in 2 days, what are they up to!? now IMP Aryan doesn&#39;t work! Too bad they don&#39;t got an updater for it!

&lt;/EDIT&gt;
Please vote, I realy need to know!
At me its NADA!

I tought I did something wrong when updating it, but it seemed I did not thanks to sL3Ak
[quote=&quot;sL3Ak, post:1, topic:1866&quot;]Ok I posted this on fagex, so here&#39;s a basic outlook on what has happened. I am a noob to these forums so don&#39;t flame or say shit about me.

Aryan may come to an end, for a period of time. As all co-ordinates have been changed, as the new Wilderness update had changed the co-ordinates, that Aryan has compiled inside it. Now basically, all that needs to be edited is, the co-ords within scripts, either that or tidy up the whole bot, which obviously will take alot of time, but i&#39;m very sure some of the other communitys that dedicate their work to Aryan, and the editing of the bot.

Impsoft, and RsResources, will be the ones who&#39;ll end up fixing the bot and/or scripts, but until they do, there shall be no autoing what so ever.


On a side note-
Jagex may find this time to ban your autoing accounts, as they&#39;ll notice that they don&#39;t seem to login, and with that they&#39;ll assume as checking the action within your account changing rapidly, then double track your IP back to your main account, may actually realise that you were autoing, and boom you&#39;re banned.

So watch out, remember when you auto use a proxy. Do not drop trade to your main. Remeber these things, it&#39;ll keep you safe.
