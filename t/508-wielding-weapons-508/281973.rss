    <description>Hi everyone. Im currently trying to make dragon claws in my 508 server (client). I dont have the models for the dragon claws so im using rune claws, but theres a problem with it. When I wield the rune claws in my run.bat it says &quot;Unsupported item: 3101&quot; and it wont wield the claws. btw thats the server run.bat not client. It happens with all claws and some other weapons also. I was wondering if anyone knew why this is happening. 

Please reply, thanks.

P.S. If anyone has the models for dragon claws you can post them here :P[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 03, 2009, 03:12:01 pm[/size][hr]Still need help...</description>
