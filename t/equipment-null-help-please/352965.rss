    <title>Equipment Null - Help Please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/equipment-null-help-please/352965</link>
    <description> I&#39;m been working on unlimited-pkz blank server(317) for some time now, and since the beginning there has been 2 nulls, one of which in the equipment(chest) area. The second one is in the equipment(legs) area. I figured it would be rather simple to get rid of a null because I could just delete the current nulls by going to the character list, I also went to player.java and edited that so that the equipment options looks like:

[code=javascript]
		//Giving the player an unique look
		playerEquipment[playerHat]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerCape]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerAmulet]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerChest]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerShield]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerLegs]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerHands]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerFeet]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerRing]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerArrows]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerWeapon]=-1;[/code]

As you can see all them are set to have no armor when they start, I also tried 0 instead -1.
