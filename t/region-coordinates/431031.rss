    <title>Region Coordinates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/region-coordinates/431031</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to improve my region system in my server, by having regions loaded and unloaded when he level of activity changes (for example, if there&#39;s two people online, one in Varrock and one in Canifis, there&#39;s no reason to process events from Al Kharid and Lumbridge). After reading sinisoul&#39;s post about regions in the Tutorials section, I found one implementation problem. While regions do have an X and Y position, they are not on the same scale as the rest of the world (it would be like plotting a function of a 1:1 scale, and 1:5 scale on the same plane). The only thing that I could think of to solve this problem is to have another object, RegionLocation or something similar, and map the active regions using HashMap&lt;RegionLocation, Region&gt;. Is there a more appropriate solution, and if so, what are your suggestions?</description>

<p>Yes. Like it was posted earlier, another server uses a RegionCoordinate class to represent the location. If I had something like that, then I could store the regions in a HashMap&lt;RegionLocation, Region&gt;. However, the problem still remains with the implementation.</p>
<p>I do like the idea of having the field player keep track of its region. I hadn’t thought about that.</p>

<p>Wait, what do you mean they are not on the same scale? The universal unit (besides coordinates) is chunks (8 x 8). Actually when you do construction or dungeoneering the scale is in chunks so that’d be a good base unit to work with.</p>
<p>My approach would be:</p>
<p>Player has map around himself.<br>
Player is at coordinate x, y<br>
Calculate what is around player through the player scope.<br>
Populate his map with what is around him.<br>
Do for all players.<br>
Enact methods to update each entity with an act method for animations and such. Callback to player to send update to client.<br>
Reset player map.</p>
<p>That would allow you to actually play with ‘scopes’ of the world while only having one global scope where all the entities and players are stored. Each player could be considered in their own scope and something fun would to have scopes registered to the world such as ‘CASTLE WARS GAME 0’, ‘PEST CONTROL 2’.  So many possibilities with that if you can correctly implement it.</p>

<p>The way traditional (winterlove based) servers do things is all of the normal Npc updating, every tick, and then the Npc update block data is sent to the player after it’s been added to the list. So yes the update block is still created, and processed by the server, but the networking data may not be sent, depending on whether or not it’s added to a players list.</p>
<p>Also: If there were only 64 regions in each way, there are 4096 possible regions. Even if there are 2000 people online, and each one were in it’s own region, that’s still 2000 regions, that are loaded into memory, that aren’t being used.</p>

<p>Why though. Considering there is in runescape, and popular servers there are people all over. It would some what work… but that is all. I mean if there is areas you want to just not process (unreachable), then just ‘blacklist’ them, and don’t load them.</p>

</aside>
<p>To make the server more efficient. For example, most servers have some Npcs who only welcome the user, let’s say with “Welcome to SomeScape”. That string is 21 bytes long. Now, if the server runs for 24 hours, that’s 144,000 server updates. Sending that one string, to one Npc, every tick, for one day results in 3,024,000 bytes being processed. The server still creates those strings, even if nobody is there to see it. Multiply that by an arbitrary number of Npcs, and it racks up quite quickly, for no reason at all.</p>

              <p>Why though. Considering there is in runescape, and popular servers there are people all over. It would some what work… but that is all. I mean if there is areas you want to just not process (unreachable), then just ‘blacklist’ them, and don’t load them.</p>

              <p>The problem is that that the events aren’t being handled in the traditional manner. Usually, there’s one thread that directly handles the various “events” happening in the world, all of the time. To elaborate, if there are 2 players, both in Varrock, the server will continue to process events for Npcs and such in Lumbridge, Draynor, Seer’s Village, etc. This is a waste of resources because if there are no players around to see the events, then there’s really no reason to process them. With my approach, the regions are created and destroyed, based on whether or not it’s active.</p>
<p>For example, 2 players are fighting each other in the wilderness. One dies and respawns in Lumbridge. Since one player is still in the wilderness, and one is now in Lumbridge, two regions are now active; the one that contains the wilderness, and the one that contains Lumbridge. Now, let’s say the person in Lumbridge rage quits. Now, since there is only one player online (in the wilderness), there’s absolutely no reason to process events from the remaining active region (Lumbridge). The server then destroys (or unloads) the region when there are no more events to process (like dropped items, and anything else that updates players).</p>
<p>My problem is that I don’t want to load at least 64x64 regions. That almost defeats the entire purpose.</p>

              <p>well yea, you can do that, or i was thinking the boolean. like the pk one:</p>
<p><code>	public boolean isInFalador(int coordX, int coordY, int Type) {
			if ((coordX &gt;= XXXX) &amp;&amp; (coordX &lt;= XXXX) &amp;&amp; (coordY &lt;= YYYY)
					&amp;&amp; (coordY &gt;= YYYY)) {
				return true;
			}
		}
		return false;
	}</code></p>
<p>then make a void for whats in Falador.(all the shops and stuff) And i guess in the walking method, you put the void there and if you aren’t in Falador, it would return false and nothing would load(besides that part of the map). And btw, if this doesn’t make sense to you, we are probably thinking of different things.</p>

              <p>[quote=“jaruanna, post:2, topic:431031”]I have a suggestion. Maybe you can put all the codes into regions(if you see what im trying to get at). Like, if there is a trader in Al Kharid, put it in an <code>If (playerisInRegion()) { 
shopsOpen = true;
 } else {
shopsClosed = true;
}</code><br>
If you don’t understand im sorry. But thats my suggestion[/quote]</p>
<p>Let me explain; how would you check what region the player is in? Traditionally, it’s the player’s position / 64 for X and Y. But what would you do with those coordinates? How would you check if the player is in that region. Sure you could do</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for (Region r : regions) {// All loaded regions
    if (r.getX() == x &amp;&amp; r.getY() == y) {
        return r;
    }
}
Region r = new Region(x, y);
r.init();
regions.add(r);
return r;</code></pre>

              <p>I’m trying to improve my region system in my server, by having regions loaded and unloaded when he level of activity changes (for example, if there’s two people online, one in Varrock and one in Canifis, there’s no reason to process events from Al Kharid and Lumbridge). After reading sinisoul’s post about regions in the Tutorials section, I found one implementation problem. While regions do have an X and Y position, they are not on the same scale as the rest of the world (it would be like plotting a function of a 1:1 scale, and 1:5 scale on the same plane). The only thing that I could think of to solve this problem is to have another object, RegionLocation or something similar, and map the active regions using HashMap&lt;RegionLocation, Region&gt;. Is there a more appropriate solution, and if so, what are your suggestions?</p>
