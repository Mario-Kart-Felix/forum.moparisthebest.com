For those of you who may not know, Jagex is planning a second bot nuke update. Not that it really affects most of us but there is also something troubling that I heard with there being a secondary sort of mapdata that will have to be used with interfaces. That would be crippling towards RSPS development because it&#39;d be near impossible to create features without the interfaces. What do you guys plan to expect and how do you think the client will function after this point. I heard rumors of direct memory mapping of objects through pointers to access and modify them which means the client might have more native pieces to it.

Jagex has always had the ability to encrypt their files in their file system but never have except for map files. Why would they start doing that for interfaces now of all times? The approximate revision they started enciphering map files was 414.

<p>414 has mapdata, this was the revision that the cache system changed to be what it is currently today.</p>

              <p>Hmm, even if it does mean that we can’t get new interfaces its no big deal… Can just use the old one, all these new revisions are ALWAYS half finished, bugged to hell etc. This gives people time to actually improve what they currently have rather than constantly upgrading while other people crack the cache so all in all its not that bad.<br>
I’ve honestly been waiting for optimus to happen since march, looking forward to it. Hopefully they’ll be some events like last time, new combat and bots will be gfed for a while again = sounds good.</p>
