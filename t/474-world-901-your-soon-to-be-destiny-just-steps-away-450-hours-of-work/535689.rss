[center][b]Don&#39;t worry, there is no anti-leech.[/b][/center]

World 901 was my dream server, but I really got sick of the older revision&#39;s look, simply because I saw it 6 hours a day. This server had tons of dedication. We had a website, a VPS, and were even up for 1 month, but as time went, support was lost, and communication between the staff weakened. The co-owner and I got bored of the server also. I&#39;d like to give my sincere thanks to all of those who contributed to this project, from the extent of just simply reporting a bug or actually programming something for us to use. My thanks goes out to the staff of World 901, past and present, for being with be along the way.

[i]I started World 901, so I ended World 901.[/i]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Due to failed QA team, lack of communication, and lack of contenet, this server is being discontinued and the website disbanded. We hope this isn&#39;t a shocker, as the support for it has been dwindling these last few weeks and we&#39;re sorry if anything is new to you.

We thank you all for the support and motivational words that were said towards the end. We (the team) is going to use this as a learning experience for our upcoming projects. We hope you stay tuned for our upcoming servers, as they will be better and newer than this one, with the same idea as putting the community first and our new ideas into action.

Think of this as a &quot;test project&quot;. You are the most important one, the patient. We tried all our best, the developers learning tons and tons (and walking out of this project with more knowledge than they had ever seen before (or knew they could have), and this project served us well. We have collected the pros and cons from what we see that we did wrong as a staff team.

Please, do not see this as a typical &quot;we quit&quot; message, but as a reminder that YOU, the reader, and you supporters, played a role in our lives. We now know our mistakes, we know know our strengths and weaknesses, and we walk out of World 901, your soon to be destiny, just steps away, with new, profound knowledge both in leadership and programming knowledge.

So no, we the staff have not quit. See this as a building block. You helped us achieve a building block of our server. We learned from our (I and Arham) previous server, FroyoScape, that finance plays a huge role of epic proportions! And now, we walk away with World 901 with a new lesson, one we had over-looked so long ago, that communication with your team and activity with the combination of motivation builds the factor of success.

Once again, thank you for your support. World 901 wouldn&#39;t have been anything without it&#39;s fans.

- Owner Arham, Co-Owner Andrew, and the rest of World 901 staff (Past, and present.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And the server&#39;s inspiration was from this RuneScape short movie. I suggest you guys check it out!

Thank you, and I hope you guys download this and use this for your projects,

P.S1: Some of the code in this server is terrible due to the immense amount of knowledge I gained from this server. My other developer, my man, Dylan (JavaLearner), could also agree, being a person who couldn&#39;t program a quest to now being someone equivalent in knowledge to me. Please, if you ever do use this, try and improve on our code. ;)
P.S2: The home music is so nostalgic, I swear!</description>

<p>btw why ingame so lagging?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not sure, as I get no lag.</p>
<p>[s]Maybe try to remove the -XmsNUMBERm in the run.bat (if you are using the bat).</p>
<p>AND EVERYONE! The server is not to its most updated state. To fix this, go into out/production/World 901 Server and copy the contents, then remove the contents IN the bin folder and then paste the files you copied.</p>
<p>I will reupload the source with the fix soon. For the time being, refer to this post.[/s]</p>
<p>REUPLOADED SOURCE WITH FIXES!</p>
<p>I am willing to help ANYONE using my source, so add me on skype (thunderstrike420) and tell me your username here (be sure to mention you are from MoparScape) and I will gladly assist you. In thanks of using this server.</p>
