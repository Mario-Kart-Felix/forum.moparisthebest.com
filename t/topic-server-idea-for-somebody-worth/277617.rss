    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/topic-server-idea-for-somebody-worth/277617</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I saw Mapu&#39;s post trying to give some a server idea and it seemed successful, so i&#39;m going to do the same.  I&#39;m looking for a coder who may want to update my server.

- the server will hopefully be f2p.
- its like the old runescape before the wilderness (and this has already been coded).
- i&#39;m going to edit the XMLS etc and restrict the map.

I can do most of the work as its just editing XMLS.. i may need some one to improve the server efficiency and stuff.  If anyone is interested i&#39;l hopefully have a beta version up sometime this weekend for you to try it.. before accepting.

my email address is: salrathor1@hotmail.com.

Take Care.</description>

<p>Mapu, i’m really interested to see yours too considering epicPK is using your map system and stuff… although me and you had a few differences when we came to brainstorming ideas over there, so i’m guessing we will end up with different servers too <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>good luck to you though… i would prefer someone else to make a fun server for me to play… Rather than me having to try and maintain a server with my lack of expertise! but my server is going to be quite different because its going to be about trying to get pixels as well as pking to add that old school spark… (without going into too much detail :P)</p>

<p>What I’m trying to hint to you is don’t waste your time making a server. It will be ddos’d and put down the day it goes up. Even if you being in-experienced isn’t enough reason not to put a server up, ddos will happen to you.</p>
<p>If you have some patience then you will see this new server idea come into fruition, although the server idea is not 99% original, it is however a completely new dynamic.</p>
<p>It’s a pk server but will draw everybody in. Skilling will be possible, and a major part of the economy. No other pk server has managed that quiet as good as this will.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 06, 2009, 05:46:16 pm[/size][hr]ps.

<p>Yeah sorry, I have restricted the old landscape.  I have put fences to cut access to Al-Kharid, Falador and the Wilderness.</p>

              <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I saw Mapu’s post trying to give some a server idea and it seemed successful, so i’m going to do the same.  I’m looking for a coder who may want to update my server.</p>
<ul>
<li>the server will hopefully be f2p.</li>
<li>its like the old runescape before the wilderness (and this has already been coded).</li>
<li>i’m going to edit the XMLS etc and restrict the map.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can do most of the work as its just editing XMLS… i may need some one to improve the server efficiency and stuff.  If anyone is interested i’l hopefully have a beta version up sometime this weekend for you to try it… before accepting.</p>
<p>my email address is: <a href="mailto:salrathor1@hotmail.com">salrathor1@hotmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>Take Care.</p>
