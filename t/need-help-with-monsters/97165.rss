<p>Even so that doesn’t explain the glicth. It DOES only hold so much health on the bar, however, after you use up that bar another is filled. I figured this out when I was on a server and a monster wasn’t dying although his bar was depleted. It kept comming back. After a while I finally beat it and realised it was because it had 10,000 HP. So the glicth is weird. Sorry I can’t help =/</p>
