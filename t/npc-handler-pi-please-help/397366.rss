    <description>hey guys,
currently when i kill and npc it doesn&#39;t die properly? it like stays on the ground and takes ages to respawn and when it does it&#39;s not like it respawns it just stays there.
e.g if i walked around before it wont after that and you cannot attack it.
it&#39;s with every npc, i even did ::npcreset and same thing. i killed a man and it came back and also was unattackable but i was able to thieve from it.

please guys i have tryed alot of things.
maybe would i be able to get a new npc.java file? or npchandler file?

please help i have msn if someone can help</description>
