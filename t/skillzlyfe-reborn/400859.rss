    <title>Skillzlyfe Reborn</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skillzlyfe-reborn/400859</link>
    <description>I have been working on many projects that I decided to quit because there was just too much work to be done. Many people may hate me for using Delta as a base but I have Grahams event manager and I have also cleaned out the process a bit.

Here is the link of what Skillzlyfe used to look like before I released it.[url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,468597.msg3425841.html#msg3425841]CLICK HERE[/url]

The reason for me remaking this is because I noticed that quite a few people love old school servers and this was a fun old school based server I created roughly 4-5 years ago. I hit a maximum of 80+ people online at once with no lagg.

To check out all the updates of the server please visit [url=http://skillzlyfe.comxa.com/]http://skillzlyfe.comxa.com/[/url]

Here is a little video of thieving.

You may see thieving as crappy with a rubbish event but this is soon all to be changed.

Pictures shall be coming soon as I have cleaned out npc drops, shops, autospawn, npchandler, wanneshop in the client class and much more.</description>
