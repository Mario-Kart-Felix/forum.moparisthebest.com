    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-questions-help-answer-please-there-on-the-second-page-first-page-solved/12944</link>
    <description>I want to know how to create (objects,may they be called?)like those of runescape,those graphics how do you create them?Do you need an external program to do this?Thanks for listening to my funny questions.

PS I don&#39;t understand some things in my java book:
Q1)What is the difference between an argument and a comand line argument?

Q2)When they say 
[code]int howbad [] = {3,3,2,4}
        Err getErrorInfo(int i)[/code]
What is the value of i?Is it initialized to a random number or what?
If it needs more clarification please state,the program is [b]very[/b] long


Thanks for all the help.</description>

<p>Can I ask one more question?</p>
<p>In the example you just gave me, the value of int i is declared later,right?<br>
In a if/for loop, my book always has something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(i&lt;=0 i++)</code></pre>
<p>That example was missing something,I know.But the main part is, they do not specify what “i” is, the only clue that I have is</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int i</code></pre>
<p>Ist that possible?</p>

              <p>You dont really need to know much about the mothod signature, its just that if you want to call a specific method, you have to have the same number of parameters (usually only of concern in overloading a method).</p>
<p>Paramters are the variables (or arguments) the the method takes.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">methodName(int i)</code></pre>
<p>when you call the method you need an argument of type int (because of its signature). when you call it you will use something like <code>int aValue = methodName(3);</code><br>
so, “i” gets set to 3 (within the scope of the method)</p>

Now,I have more noob questions for you:<br>
1)What do you mean by signature?<br>
2)What do you mean by perimeter?<br>
both these questions will tell you I’m still a noob,sorry 'bout that.</p>
<p>Now,as for the first question,what I mean is that when they do something like<br>
blah blah (int i)<br>
what does the i normally mean?Isit a value given by the class already,or is it a new number set to 0?Thanks for your time and sorry about the sloppy wording…</p>

              <p>I have heard of Blitz, though never used it, if it interests you, have a go! it looks as though it will keep you interested long enough learn a bit about game making.</p>
<p>as for the questions, i dont know how correct my answers will be, but ill have a go anyway</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>an argument would be a parameter of a function, eg <code>function(argument1, argument2, ..., argumentN)</code> and a command line argument would be a word used when running your application eg <code>java myApplication argument1 argument2</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>im not sure that i can analyse it correctly out of context, but <code>int howbad [] = {3,3,2,4}</code> looks to be declaring an array of type int that contains the values 3, 3, 2 and 4.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>i am not sure about the function, so this will probably be totally wrong…</p>
<p><code>Err getErrorInfo(int i)</code> is declaring the method signature of getErrorInfo()</p>
<ul>
<li>it returns type Err</li>
<li>it takes one parameter, an int, which is presumably an error code to be handled</li>
</ul>

Theres nothing wrong with being 11 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> at least you are willing to learn, unlike the vast majority of this community. I, myself, tried to learn PHP at around 14, gave up then six months later tried again and succeeded, must have started java around 2 years ago, now that im 18 I often wish that i had a computer earlier so that i could have had a head start, so to speak <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>It depends on what languages you know and what you plan to do with them.</p>
<p>Personally, I started of with web development, so I learnt html and some css, eventually learned javascript and php. I cant remember how long it took me, but I gave that up when I got into rsc cheating and learned java by fixing/editing scripts or by example.</p>
<p>If you already know a fair amount of java, learn how to do ‘basic’ graphics in applets then perhaps some advanced graphics programming, it all depends on how much time and effort you want to put into it.</p>
<p>In regards to 3d graphics, it depends what sort you actually want to learn, whether it is using J3D; a ‘real’ 3d graphics package, or, using a lot of trig and vectors (like runescape) to make your own ‘pseudo’ 3d graphics, or much simpler, some sort of isometric setup.</p>
<p>C# is alot like java in many aspects, but .Net is just horrible. I would like to learn C/C++ but havent had enough time to dedicate myself to it yet. The only procedural (you said you wanted to learn a  non-OO language in your other thread) I have ever used is Scheme, which is quite horrible, but it can be intersting at times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Javascript/HTML/CSS are good because they dont require anything special other than a web-browser.</li>
<li>PHP is good as it is fairly easy to use (once you have set up PHP and apache).</li>
<li>JAVA is just sexy, it’s great because it is an extremely OO language.</li>
<li>C/C++ sound goods because they are ‘relatively fast’ and its what most commercial devs use.</li>
<li>Scheme is used in first year university/college to introduce programming concepts as it is fairly easy to learn</li>
