[center]Moparscape, When You Go To This Website, Look Around, You See All Sorts Of People. These people are all here for one main purpose. To further their understanding And Knowledge of Private Servers, To gain reputation With The Community, And To Help Other People With Private Servers. As I look around, I see so many people, who with the purpose of furthering their knowledge and other people&#39;s knowledge, that have posted something. I scroll through their work, I see some good things, then I see that a small portion of it is leeched.
Now, most of us here right now would automatically start flaming it. You would say &quot;Gtfo Leecher&quot; or, &quot;Fail&quot;, etc. I have posted this, because I believe we can all help Moparscape. I believe that, so oftenly, we have looked [i]down[/i] at other people&#39;s work instead of looking up as we should. The reason I wrote this, is to urge you, and everyone else, that no matter how small, no matter how much someone leeched, no matter how crappy you think something is, to make something positive, and constructive out of it.[/center]
