    <title>Trouble With CMD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trouble-with-cmd/432926</link>
    <description>Hi, before reading this you need to know that I wasn&#39;t sure where to post this, and not to ask me for teamviewer info, because I am not going to let you see my ip address.

With that said I will get on with it.

Ok so I need to change my ip address and I want to see my ipconfig info so I went to run and typed ipconfig, the little box came up but went away almost directly after. I also tried to go to CMD and tried to type ipconfig but it said something like &quot;ipconfig is not recognized as an internal or external command&quot; I also tried ipconfig/all but that didn&#39;t work. Someone&#39;s help would be greatly appreciated.

P.S: if anyone knows how to change my ip address I need to know that too but I still need this problem fixed.
Oh and it&#39;s a Windows XP computer of that helps.</description>

<p>I can agree with the first two, but your third one is completely unjustified. If you ever find yourself working with a 3D modeler and are trying to understand a design, goodluck achieving that without something as convenient as teamviewer. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>This. Go in to your environmental variables and fix PATH to also lead to System32.</p>

              <p>When you go into run dont type in “Ipconfig” type in “cmd” then when the command prompt opens up then type “ipconfig” and press enter. Hope this helps. Sorry for the short explanation but I’m like half asleep.</p>

              <p>Hi, before reading this you need to know that I wasn’t sure where to post this, and not to ask me for teamviewer info, because I am not going to let you see my ip address.</p>
<p>With that said I will get on with it.</p>
<p>Ok so I need to change my ip address and I want to see my ipconfig info so I went to run and typed ipconfig, the little box came up but went away almost directly after. I also tried to go to CMD and tried to type ipconfig but it said something like “ipconfig is not recognized as an internal or external command” I also tried ipconfig/all but that didn’t work. Someone’s help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>P.S: if anyone knows how to change my ip address I need to know that too but I still need this problem fixed.<br>
Oh and it’s a Windows XP computer of that helps.</p>
