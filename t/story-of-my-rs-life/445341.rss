    <description>- - Story of my life - -
I first started my journey across a trainstation, where I befriended a homeless man, who later on tought me the ways on using the cheap but useful Dragon Dagger (was only 30K), when I joined the Duel Arena team, I worked my way up with blood..sweat..and tears. While the richy duelers were laughing at me, waving their claws around and whatnot, I was getting stronger and stronger.....then one day, I had to go in a dueling match against one of them, who was blowing air off his gear, as if he&#39;s the best. I saved my dragon dagger for last, and used my abyssal whip to rough him up at first. I won&#39;t lie he was strong, strong as can be. Near the end, 23 HP he was gonna attempt to DFS spec me, but while he was charging it up, I was slicing him 4 (x2) times with my dagger. He fell to my feet to a 30K weapon, in his 40M gear.
- - The End - 

- - The Wild Trip - -
I was in a 1v1 with another Level-124, his gear was..the common low-risker (or so I thought). Fighter torso, helmet of nietznot, rune platelegs, d boots, legends&#39; cape, glory, rune defender, and abyssal whip. We kept fighting, back and forth. We kept healing all the time when we got down to 20-25 HP, safety reason :p. Near, when I was running out of food I wanted to end it quickly...so, I THEN DREW MY ARMADYL GODSWORD...but he drew his claws first. Next thing I know I&#39;m in edgeville with no items. Goodfight.

<li>Story of my life - -<br>
I first started my journey across a trainstation, where I befriended a homeless man, who later on tought me the ways on using the cheap but useful Dragon Dagger (was only 30K), when I joined the Duel Arena team, I worked my way up with blood…sweat…and tears. While the richy duelers were laughing at me, waving their claws around and whatnot, I was getting stronger and stronger…then one day, I had to go in a dueling match against one of them, who was blowing air off his gear, as if he’s the best. I saved my dragon dagger for last, and used my abyssal whip to rough him up at first. I won’t lie he was strong, strong as can be. Near the end, 23 HP he was gonna attempt to DFS spec me, but while he was charging it up, I was slicing him 4 (x2) times with my dagger. He fell to my feet to a 30K weapon, in his 40M gear.</li>

I was in a 1v1 with another Level-124, his gear was…the common low-risker (or so I thought). Fighter torso, helmet of nietznot, rune platelegs, d boots, legends’ cape, glory, rune defender, and abyssal whip. We kept fighting, back and forth. We kept healing all the time when we got down to 20-25 HP, safety reason :p. Near, when I was running out of food I wanted to end it quickly…so, I THEN DREW MY ARMADYL GODSWORD…but he drew his claws first. Next thing I know I’m in edgeville with no items. Goodfight.</li>
