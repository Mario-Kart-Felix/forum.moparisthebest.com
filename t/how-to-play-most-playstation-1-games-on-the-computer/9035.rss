You can play most PS1 games right on your computer using an emulator called ePSXe! This emulator works on both Windows and Linux and you don&#39;t even have to install it! This tutorial supports WIndows and Linux.

Lucky for you, I wanted to play playstation games cause my playstation is about to break and I found all the files for you. So just download my Playstation Emulator and it&#39;s completely configured for your benefit. The help files are in there, and you can save games in this emulator perfectly. 

Windows: [url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=JU51XIN1]Download ePSXe 1.6 with Plugins &amp; Bios for Windows - 2.19 MB[/url] - WORKS FINE!
Linux: [url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=GCVAA9GK]Download ePSXe 1.6 with Plugins &amp; Bios for Linux - 699 KB[/url] - WORKS FINE!

[b]If the above downloads do not work then try this Torrent of both of those files. To download torrents you need a BitTorrent application. I suggest [url=http://www.utorrent.com]uTorrent[/url].[/b]

[b]-&gt; Here are some popular games that work:[/b]
- Castlevania Symphony of the Night :)
- Colin McRae Rally 1 and 2
- Crash Bandicoot 1, 2 and 3 :)
- Driver 1 and 2
- Fifa 99/2000.
- Final Fantasy VII, VIII and IX :)
- Iss98, Isspro evolution
- Knockout Kings 99, 2000
- Lunar 1, 2 :)
- NBA Live 2000, and 2001
- Need For Speed III, IV, V
- Ridge Racer
- Ridge Racer type 4
- Soulblade
- Syphon Filter 1, 2 :)
- Tekken 1, 2 and 3 :)
- Tigger Woods 99, 2000
- Tomb Raider 1, 2, 3 and 4
- Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater 2 :)
- Vagrant Story :)
- and many more ...

[b]-&gt; Minimum system requirements:[/b]
  P200MMX or compatible
  32 MB of RAM
  Fast graphic card (like the voodoo 2)
  Cdrom x16
  Win9x
  DirectX 7a

[b]-&gt; Recommended system configuration:[/b]
  P2 450 or greater
  128 Mb of RAM
  Very fast DirectX, Opengl or Glide graphic card
  fast CD-ROM
  Win9x
  DirectX 7a

The above information was derived from the ePSXe documents. My emulator works fine on my computer. And my computer has integrated video and not that great sound. So if you have any where near the minimum requirements, you should be fine. :)

[b]-&gt; Running from CD Rom[/b]
Make sure to extract the folder, ePSXe, to your desktop. Then open it, click on ePSXe.exe, pop in your PS1 game and click on File &gt; Run CD ROM. 

[img]http://img102.imageshack.us/img102/7307/epsxe2sf8.jpg[/img]

[b]-&gt; Creating an image file of your CD to Play Off your Hard Drive[/b]
You can also play games from .ISO files! So you can download PS1 games from torrents in an ISO format and play them that way if you don&#39;t wish to pay for them. ;) Of you can take your real games and use a program to create a .ISO image file and then store it on your computer so you will never have to worry about scratching your games again.


[ul][*] Get Alcohol 120%. Knowing me, you don&#39;t have to pay for it. ;) [url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=EQW9LOU9]Click Here for the program![/url]
[*] After it&#39;s installed, pop in your game disk.
[*] Open Alcohol 120% and click on Image Making Wizard.
[*] Datatype is on the bottom left, make sure to set that to Play Station.
[*] Click on Next, and navigate to your ePSXe directory, add a folder called Games, and select it to be the folder you want to save the image file to.
[*] For the Image Format, choose CloneCD Image File.
[*] Hit Start and boom your image is made in less than 5 minutes![/ul]


Now to play the game, open up ePSXe and click on File &gt; Run ISO and click on the new image file you made in your Games directory. :D

[b]-&gt; Other Notes[/b]
The video and sound and everythign else has been configured for you by me. But if you wish, you can tweak the settings however you want. Just click on Config &gt; Video or Sound or whatever. This has been configured for the Logitech Game Pad. You may want to adjust the controls for your keyboard or your own game pad. [url=http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=963325-0403-DT&amp;cat=JOY]Here is my controller[/url]. It&#39;s about $22 at Comp USA or Best Buys.

For more information, their main website is [url=http://www.ePSxe.com]ePSXe.com[/url]. Happy gaming! 

~Ron

PS: Legal issues... If you do not have a playstation nor the games you are playing on the emulator then you are doing something illegal. Note that I do have a Playstation and I play only the games I bought. This is just a tutorial for those whose playstations are broken or lost and for games that have been legally bought.</description>

              <p>You need to lower the frame rate. Go into ePSXe, Config &gt; Video &gt; Click on configure.</p>
<p>Look in the category Framerate. Find Use FPS limit and check it, then find Auto-Detect FPS/Frame Skipping Limit and check that. Finally, find the FPS Limit (10-200) text box and change its value to 60. Here are my settings.</p>

There are 2 xbox emulators. They each can only emulate 1 different game. One emulates Halo 1 with some glitches and slow graphics. The other emulates some other game no one cares about.</p>
<p>So the xbox Emulators suck right now.</p>

Pyro, did it work for you? And for the ISOs, you don’t have to download them. Look at my burn your own ISO part of the guide. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Just pop inone of your PS1 games and burn the ISO onto your Hard Drive, and play off the image file.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yea got it working. Had a quick go on tekeen 3 that i foudn lyign round. It started skipping and slowing down though. So i just turned it off for another day when i have the patience to fiddle with it. Would it be better to run from a iso. Considering i have a bottem of the line computer.</p>

So now the Windows and Linux versions of mine are perfect. The Linux version is now up for grabs and works great on Ubuntu Linux.</p>
