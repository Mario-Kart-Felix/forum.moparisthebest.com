[Cartman:] Weeelllll,

Kyle&#39;s mom&#39;s a bitch, she&#39;s a big fat bitch,
She&#39;s the biggest bitch in the whole wide world,
She&#39;s a stupid bitch, if there ever was a bitch,
She&#39;s a bitch to all the boys and girls.

On Monday she&#39;s a bitch
On Tuesday she&#39;s a bitch
On Wednesday thru Saturday she&#39;s a bitch
Then on Sunday just to be different,
Shes u super king kamehameha bitch

Have you ever met my friend Kyle&#39;s Mom,
She&#39;s the biggest bitch in the whole wide world,
She&#39;s a mean old bitch, she has stupid hair,
She&#39;s a bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
She&#39;s a stupid bitch, Kyle&#39;s Mom&#39;s a bitch,
And she&#39;s such a dirty bitch.

Talk to kids around the world,
It might go a little something like this...

[Sung in three different languages by other children]
