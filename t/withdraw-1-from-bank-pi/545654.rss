    <title>Withdraw 1 from bank [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/withdraw-1-from-bank-pi/545654</link>
    <description>Hi I followed this guide for my pi server due the fact that there was item packet dupes everywhere.
Now when I try to withdraw 1 from bank (rightclick or left click) it doesn&#39;t work. Not 100% sure if it was caused by that, cause i only just noticed it.

But, i had to follow the guide from a quote on page 2 cause it had been removed.

              <p>None of the quoted code looks like it’s related to banking.<br>
Show your code for Bank.java (the bank 1 item packet) and whatever may be related to it</p>
