    <description>[center]Project infamous[/center]

[u][b]Introduction[/b][/u]
I know I don&#39;t have the best reputation for coding in the past, but, I have recently studied in a java class. So, to show that I have learned a lot, I have decided to start this base. This is mainly a story mode kind of thing. You have to work your way up through a series of events to try to beat the objective, defeating the godwars bosses. After you defeat the godwars bosses, you will be able to roam free in a independent world from the godwars dictation and begin your journey up through the medieval rankings of army.
