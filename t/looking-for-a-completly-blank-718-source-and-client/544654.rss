    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-completly-blank-718-source-and-client/544654</link>
    <description>Title says it all. i tryed useing the zenith source and client but it has a broken compiler so i doesnt save my worth. i DO NOT want matrix. as it lacks npcspawning.java which i need to make my npc stand still.

IF ANYBODDY KNOW A FIX FOR THE ZENITH COMPILER OR HOW TO MAKE NPCS STAND STILL ON MATRIX BLANK SOURCE PLEASE TELL ME HOW!!!
EDIT:
I&#39;d like having like bosses and stuff coded in. stuff like that. i wanna make my own home. spawn my own npcs for the home but i want like coded gwd or something like that. or make it so i can make the people for gwd spawn. like nex or the bandos guy (cant remember the name)
And stuff like corp. i will make teleports there. i just need it to be coded it with it.

Thanks in advance.
