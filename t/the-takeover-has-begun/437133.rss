It was 2 in the morning, It is very well possible for a stronghold to be inside a 1kX1k world. I have found one located around -250,500 on one of my servers. Sand is yellow, that stone is yellow. who is to say the picture wasn’t taken using a texture pack. besides, I have been in “the end” one time, I don’t know what the blocks look like.</p>

<p>Funny, you must be mistaking. I never troll anyone, and I’m quite a friendly person (unless you give me reason not to be). From what I remember, I have been on maybe once or twice while you were on, and 1 of those times I offered you land in the city that me and manbearpig owned. I have been in creative world maybe once, and I have played maybe 5 times for about 10 minutes each time since creative has been around because I gave up all my items and basically quit (besides to help mbp make a spleef arena). You honestly have no clue what you are talking about, mate.</p>
<p>There are no more then 2 stars (or snowballs, cant tell) in each picture, so that’s completely out of the equation.</p>
<p>Some texture packs (especially the low detail ones) don’t change npc textures, so the only other block I would have to base off of would be snow (because the obsidian blended in the background). So that’s 2 blocks telling me that you aren’t using a shitty texture pack. In any case, Its not like i remember exactly pixel by pixel of what the snow texture looks like, so that only leaves me with 1 block. One im not familuar with (being that I have only been to the end once). so I’m supposed to assume its in “the end” when i have every reason to assume it was anywhere else BUT the end?</p>
<p>Lets rage now guys.</p>
<p>And as for triston. how often do you see me on? why would I take the time to downgrade my minecraft.jar, log on to the server, walk my happy ass to the portal, and go to the end, when i can ask a simple question and expect not to get flamed? I cant help the fact that badger gets offended by a simple question.</p>
