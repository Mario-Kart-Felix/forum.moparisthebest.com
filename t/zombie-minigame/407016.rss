    <title>Zombie Minigame!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zombie-minigame/407016</link>
    <description>Yeah, I need help with this. So many people are looking for this, I tried to solve my own problems. Pondering new thoughts to find a shortcut, but the problem with shortcuts, is that they always go wrong. 

I need some help with this, maybe a hint would be nice. Atleast a kind response, a token of gratitude. Something I can work with here. 

The problem I&#39;m having is that I can not get the next wave to start, and I don&#39;t want it to spawn 30 npc&#39;s in the first wave, cause that is just way too lame. I&#39;ve looked everywhere, and fully copied and changed every &quot;FightCaves&quot; entree, to work for Zombies. It&#39;s still a no go. 

Feel free to inbox me, help me out or simply post here. 
If you&#39;re going to offer to sell anything related to this, I&#39;m not purchasing anything. (I&#39;m broke at the moment).</description>

<p>Try copying the Jad minigame? Or create and event.<br>

<p>Trust me I tried, I also even tried twisting around the PC-Minigame, and make it spawn waves. Nothing is working, do you have any more ideas? [/quote]<br>
The only thing I can say is try making an event for it that tells the next wave to come.</p>
