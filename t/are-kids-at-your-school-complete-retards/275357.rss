    <title>Are kids at your school complete retards?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/are-kids-at-your-school-complete-retards/275357</link>
    <description>At my school, yes.

This one kid wanted to help kids build computers for his summer job. So I asked him what ram is. He said ram was like a USB, but RAM HAD A LOT MORE ROOM AND THATS WHERE ALL THE FILES ARE SAVED.

How about you guys?</description>

<p>LMFAO.</p>
<p>Erm, most people at my school are idiots. Our knowledge system for each grade is split into five groups. Those consist of:</p>
<p>Grade-3 group.<br>
Grade-2 group.<br>
Grade-1 group.<br>
Honors group.<br>
AP group.</p>
<p>The ‘grade’ represents what grade you’re in. The 3 group is the dumbest group, 2 the stupid, 1 the average, honors the smart, and AP the smartest. Starting from the 3 group to the AP group, the number of students decrease, <span class="bbcode-b">exponentially</span>. Probably 70% of the students are in 2 and 3 groups, 20% in the 1 group, 7% in the honors group, and only 3% in the AP group.</p>
<p>I, fortunately, am part of the honors group this year, (since AP level classes are not offered sophomore year in my school.) and will be in the AP group next year.</p>

              <p>Yes, I’m the minority of my school that has knowledge of a computer past what a keyboard is. But beyond that my grade is full of douchers. All of them see a viral video from like 3 months ago and repeat line for line to others and somehow get them to laugh. All of the girls in my grade are sluts, and they aren’t even sly about it, they’re just straight up “Lets get drunk and fuck tomorrow kay?”. As a guy, that should be a free ticket, but I’m not up for getting STDs.</p>
<p>On top of it all, everyone in my school that appears like they know something, they’re just so incredibly retarded it’s a miracle how they’re still in my grade. No one applies themselves, but I would just be a hypocrite if i said I did. But hey, at least I’m logical, half of these kids are just attention whores, at school for the lulz.</p>
