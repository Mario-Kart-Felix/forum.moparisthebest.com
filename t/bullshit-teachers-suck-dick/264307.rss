UPDATE: Teacher handed it back with a 75% grade. douchebag.


Alright, in school you couldn&#39;t exactly call me the &quot;hardest&quot; working kid. I do what I am told in school, but aren&#39;t interested in exceeding the standard, and my teachers are stereotypical bastards. Because I wear striped sweatshirts, have long hair, and wear straight leg jeans I am a &quot;punk&quot; who is a dillweed. 

Yesterday we had a big history report due, and I have a very low history average (77%) and decided to go &quot;Above the standard&quot; for once. I wrote a story of a civil war wife and a report on Ulysees Grant. I walk into school today to be immediately called out by our principal, greeted with &quot;Mr.Ross, how much exactly did you plagiarize on your history report?&quot;. Are you fucking kidding me?.  My history teacher had went to my principal and accused me of plagiarism. You could say he hates me for no reason, because apparently I am a &quot;punk&quot;. 
It wasn&#39;t the accusation that pissed me off as much as his reason.
Quote reason for accusing me of plagiarism:
&quot;Andrew does not use this normal vocabulary, and he would never use any of these words.&quot;
He instructed us to use a wide vocabulary and vocabulary journalists in the 1800&#39;s would use.
 The principal kept telling me things like I was going to fess up and be like , &quot;okay, maybe i plagiarized a little.&quot;
She even told me how the school has a &quot;system to detect plagiarism.&quot;
Yeah about that..
google.com
plagiarism.org

bullshit please?</description>

<p>It tells the teacher the percentage plagiarized (what a weird ass word) (almost every paper has a percentage &lt;40), where it’s from, and highlights it with a color that is used as a key to where it was plagiarized from.</p>
<p>It usually gets serious when there’s a high amount of “plagiarism” and nothing is being cited to (AKA actual plagiarism).<br>
And of course, every paper will have a percentage &gt;0. Otherwise, the paper is probably shit grammar-wise.</p>

You would never copied something form search page <span class="hashtag">#100</span>, don’t know how its work, but it don’t looks like our school’s system work since people easy can cheat by stealing 100% of the text from the Internet (The system may have been added after that, I don’t cheat so I don’t really know by my self).</p>

<p>Well, unless the teacher can provide solid proof. Then she’s just being a bitch and needs to give him the fucking A. If she still says he plagiarized it the she has to provide evidence or w/e. Maybe she is just trying to get you to stay after school for a good “session”.</p>

Alright, in school you couldn’t exactly call me the “hardest” working kid. I do what I am told in school, but aren’t interested in exceeding the standard, and my teachers are stereotypical bastards. Because I wear striped sweatshirts, have long hair, and wear straight leg jeans I am a “punk” who is a dillweed.</p>
<p>Yesterday we had a big history report due, and I have a very low history average (77%) and decided to go “Above the standard” for once. I wrote a story of a civil war wife and a report on Ulysees Grant. I walk into school today to be immediately called out by our principal, greeted with “Mr.Ross, how much exactly did you plagiarize on your history report?”. Are you fucking kidding me?.  My history teacher had went to my principal and accused me of plagiarism. You could say he hates me for no reason, because apparently I am a “punk”.<br>
It wasn’t the accusation that pissed me off as much as his reason.<br>
Quote reason for accusing me of plagiarism:<br>
“Andrew does not use this normal vocabulary, and he would never use any of these words.”<br>
He instructed us to use a wide vocabulary and vocabulary journalists in the 1800’s would use.<br>
The principal kept telling me things like I was going to fess up and be like , “okay, maybe i plagiarized a little.”<br>
She even told me how the school has a “system to detect plagiarism.”<br>
Yeah about that…<br>

<p>What more can you expect from a woman. They always take things out of proportion and always look for some sort of conspiracy.</p>
<p>Something like this happend to me once. We were in art, the teacher was giving out peices of paper and gave us an hour to draw a self portrait. She had run out of paper just before coming to me. She went to open a new pack of sheets and gave me one. I was the only one to get a sheet from that pack. After a half hour my drawing looked really good and I started the shading. She said there is no way I drew it. She said I brought it to school with me and had obviously copied it from a photograph. She could even prove it by the fact that my paper was a slight different colour and thickness. She made me start over new. I pretty much drew the same again only never got to finish the shading.</p>
<p>I guess that’s why they get women teachers though.[/quote]I would definitely refuse to redo, and I have before.</p>
