    <title>My 8 Paragraph Essay on Same-sex Marriage (in the USA)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-8-paragraph-essay-on-same-sex-marriage-in-the-usa/454557</link>
    <description>I&#39;m writing an 8 paragraph, 6 and a half paged (MLA format) essay today on same sex marriage for my English final. I thought it would be interesting to get a debate going on the subject where people can reply to my stances and give their own thoughts.

I haven&#39;t finished writing it yet so for now I&#39;ll just post my outline so you guys can start to formulate counterarguments :D (I will probably keep it here as a tl;dr once I post the full paper)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thesis: Disallowing same sex marriage violates the principles this country was founded on.

Freedom is the most important principle of the United States, and having marriage limitations does not respect it. One reason banning same-sex marriages violate freedom principles is because the Constitution says that no state should have the power to pick and choose the people to whom it will grant rights and privileges, but currently marriage laws are dealt with state-by-state.

Another clear example of the lack of freedom is when some people are given more legal opportunities than others.  The laws against same-sex marriages violate the rights of gay citizens in this respect because all people should have equal access to privileges granted after marriage, including the privilege of marriage itself.

Additionally, it&#39;s even more clear that we are violating our foundation when we start to blur our own laws to take freedoms away from others. Constitutional amendments have already been put in place to separate the church and state, but marriage is still being defined by a religious definition, even though it grants national legal privileges.

(disclaimer) However, one argument against same sex marriage is that the privilege of child care in these relationships means that children will not get both male and female parental influence.

TS for Conclusion: While some people may think of same-sex marriage as wrong, they are not breaking any laws and as such should not suffer from the lack of privileges that marriage provides.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

marriage is a part of religion, government should not control it. being gay isn’t wrong, it’s forcing your views on a religions custom because you want to be married (which should be up to a church, and if a church supports gay marriage, ask that pastor/priest to marry you…)<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If that is the case, all legal benefits that come with marriage should be completely struck off. It should be entirely ceremonial and symbolic.[/quote]</p>
<p>in the sense of government… yes.</p>

Oh God, you are one of those. It is bad enough that you believe in creationism and deny Global warming. But do you really think marriage is about love? It just the last 100 years that was the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>marriage is a part of religion, government should not control it. being gay isn’t wrong, it’s forcing your views on a religions custom because you want to be married (which should be up to a church, and if a church supports gay marriage, ask that pastor/priest to marry you…)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If that is the case, all legal benefits that come with marriage should be completely struck off. It should be entirely ceremonial and symbolic.</p>
