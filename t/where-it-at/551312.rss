              <p>Yeaaa that’s not how a company works, I understand that most people on this subreddit are far from being 30+ unlike myself, but please, don’t say anything when you don’t know how a company runs. There is no way you can hold such secrets as you would basicly be dodging taxes if they would lmao. If a company hires someone, you can find that information, even from a company that doesn’t even own a website…<br>
And yes, if you would’ve known how VALVe works, which I do since 1998 as I’ve been playing HL since '98 and CS since '99, I do know that VALVe announces internal information based on new employee’s, they always have, and if they are looking for someone (ex. a new AC-team), you can read it in their “Vacancy” part of their website…<br>
tl;dr: No, they don’t have a different AC-Team.<br>
Better just stay silent<br>
Says the 12-16 year old Redditor to a 32 year old Leisure Manager that knows how a company is legally ran.<br>
inb4 12-16 year olds spamming -karma whilest letting a tear out behind their monitor.<br>
"O noes, we have a educated adult here that can see how stupid and wrong we are, better stop replying now and just give -karma so other people can’t read my stupid comment replied by an educated person. QQ."<br>
Oh reddit, where are the old days where 90% of this subreddit wasn’t on the internet yet, such better place.</p>
