    <title>Int help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/int-help/424278</link>
    <description>Can someone help me with an int, its kind of based off like the crystal chest system that most PI server have today, however, i decided to make my own chest called the &quot;Random Chest&quot; basically what that does it runs off a points system, it costs 1 point to open, and what i would like it to do is give any random item in the game, so like item id 1-20072. The points are already added in my player and playersave.java files. So there is no problems there.

This is my actionhandler.java code for this chest:
[code=java]case 75:
if (c.rnPoints &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; c.getItems().freeSlots() &gt;= 1) {
c.rnPoints -= 1;
c.getItems().addItem(c.getPA().randomItem(), 1);
c.getDH().sendDialogues(38, 945);
} else {
c.getDH().sendDialogues(39, 945); }
break;[/code]
The rnPoints are the random points.

This next part is in playerassistant.java

Is  there a shortcut that I can use instead of going 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, etc all the way to 20072 in the following int:
[code=java]public static int Random[] = {};[/code]

I have already tried in that int this:
[code=java]public static int Random[] = {1-20072};[/code]
It compiles correctly with no errors, but when i go to the chest and open it, I get nothing? is it mistaking 1-20072 as an item id or something?
I have also tried using an Int sort of like this:
[code=java]for (int i = 0; i &lt; 22; i++)[/code]
obviously i got errors.

Just to be as clear as possible, i also have this int added in my playerassistant.java:
[code=java]public int randomItem() {//Random Points
	return Random[(int) (Math.random()*Random.length)];
	}[/code]

Hope that you guys will be able to help me, thanks.
