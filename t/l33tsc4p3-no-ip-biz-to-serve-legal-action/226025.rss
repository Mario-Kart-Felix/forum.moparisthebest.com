    <title>L33tsc4p3.no-ip.biz to serve legal action</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/l33tsc4p3-no-ip-biz-to-serve-legal-action/226025</link>
    <description>Well a few minutes ago I got in touch with a law officer that I knew from my community, and I gave him information about this issue.

I told him that the server L33tsc4p3.no-ip.biz was using copyrighted material to try to make a profit and business off of it.

I had given him evidence; screenshots that I took showing the administrator of the server there trying to sell the server or trying to sell mod/admin positions, he said it&#39;s happened before and it is illegal.

He says he was going to look into it further, and I am waiting for a response at this time. I know for sure that he&#39;s going to be taken to court and penalties may result from there. Depending on what the judge says.

Please don&#39;t be like that server, it&#39;s okay to have a server you just can&#39;t say it&#39;s your own or try to run a business off of it. I will hunt your server down and I WILL get legal action served on you!</description>
