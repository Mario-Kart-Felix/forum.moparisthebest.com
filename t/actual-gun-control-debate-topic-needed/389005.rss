    <title>Actual gun control debate topic - NEEDED</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/actual-gun-control-debate-topic-needed/389005</link>
    <description>So for my junior project we have to pick a social issue to research and create a powerpoint about, and while most of my friends are doing ocean pollution etc, they can just go on and on about how seaturtles are dieing because they think plastic bags are jellyfish. I cant. 

Im doing gun control, and the reason I came here is because people from about every corner of the world are here and I need as MANY opinions and beliefs as I can get.

The rubric just for info
- Significance of topic today
- Effects on society (this is where you guys come in)
- Personal (Friends/family) effects
- Cited sources (if you use statistics or anything please post a link to the source)

For significance today I will most likely put the modern uses for guns, like law, hunting, self defense, sport shooting, and crime.

Effects are obviously death and innocent deaths, allows crazy people to shoot up malls and stuff

etc


So Ill start the thread off with a question and hopefully it grows

Why shouldn&#39;t the public be allowed to have easy access to guns?

Why should they?</description>

<p>I’d stay away from 20 year old statistics if I were you, or at the very least compare them with 15, 10, 5 and 3 year statistics</p>
<p>also those statistics are slightly misleading,</p>
<p>“Percent households with guns includes all army personnel.”</p>
<p>I very much doubt this means 4.7% (or roughly) 2.4 million households in the uk in 1992(or 1997 or whenever the fuck they got these statistics from) has guns, I’d be surprised if the number of households with guns in the uk is in the tens of thousands, never mind millions</p>
<p>edit: somewhat relevant, <a href="http://www.thenationalshootingassociation.org.uk/reports/Greenwoodarticle.pdf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">total crimes went up but homicides stayed relatively stable</a> after the uk 1997 firearm and handgun bans</p>
<p>it was a little concerning that googling for the act lead to dozens of pro gun websites spouting pretty much the same message, “the government took guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens and crimes doubled”</p>

<p>We don’t have 163,000 knife murders a year in UK ahahaha.<br>
Murder is murder but no where in that article does it say “gun crime or knife crime” means murder. You’re more likely to survive a knife wound than a bullet. So I don’t agree with that source at all.</p>
<p>I know this isn’t ontopic, but i just found a crime map for where I live, and the other brits can use this too;<br>

<p>Still ~368g in her hand, three times her mobile phone, and it has to be held extended an aimed steady.<br>
If my great grand mother fired a gun her wrist would snap. Recoilless might be useful but a can of pepper spray still far easier for an old lady to use.<br>
The safety catch was mostly for a joke but partly serious, I actually don’t think if you gave an old lady a gun now she would know how to take the safety off, mostly because she probably doesn’t know its there, which was my point in hand. Old ladies don’t use guns, this debate is on a worldwide scale, stop applying to American farmer’s mothers who live in a barn with hundreds of guns. Most old ladies in THE WORLD have never handled a gun.<br>
The final point still is sound. Gunman pulls gone on granny, granny fumbles for handbag, reaches for gun. <em>Already dead</em> Don’t try and convince me she’ll be accurate, steady, fast and trained with a weapon.</p>
<p>There is also no reason why a can of concentrated pepperspray or taser is less effecting in disarming someone when used properly. I stand by a Granny having difficulty in all these situations though, and will just conclude that here we don’t have criminals who are dickish enough to rob our MeMas.</p>

<p>So as you can clearly see, crime is prevented and criminals foiled every day by law-abiding grannies with guns.</p>
<p>I found an interesting story about concealed carry in my state of Ohio:<br>

<p>LORAIN -- Nearly 200,000 Ohioans have been issued a license to carry a concealed handgun since the state's concealed carry law took effect in April 2004.</p>

<p>I really like a quote from an anonymous concealed carry holder, I’m going to start using it when people ask me why I carry:</p>
<blockquote>If that’s only one moment in a lifetime, I want to be prepared. I have car insurance, but that doesn’t mean I want to be in a crash. It just means being prepared.</blockquote>
<p>You will want to write about Kennesaw, Georgia, USA, where they had many home burglaries until they passed a law requiring every home with adults that could legally own a gun to keep one in their home at all times.  Crime disappeared.  Criminals don’t want to die either.</p>
<p>Also look at how crime has fell drastically in EVERY state that has implemented a good concealed carry law since 1987, while crime has steadily risen in other states (Illinois being the most glaring example)</p>

And both of which are not always effective, tazers and pepper spray do not always effect everyone.  Bullets effect everyone.</p>

So all of that work and you only get 10 minutes to present it? I’d be fucking annoyed at the lack of time after putting in significant effort.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Ha trust me the less time the better I hate public speaking and acting like you know something. My topic is pretty difficult because there is so much information to sift through. Also there is alot of information about my cause but nothing about the effects of my injustice so it is become difficult to find information.[/quote]<br>
You shouldn’t short change yourself tbh. If you put in the time and research then you will know something, and the presentation will be worth listening to.</p>

<li>Intimidation (not using it but preventing crime)</li>

<p>Ha trust me the less time the better I hate public speaking and acting like you know something. My topic is pretty difficult because there is so much information to sift through. Also there is alot of information about my cause but nothing about the effects of my injustice so it is become difficult to find information.</p>

<p>The problem with these statistics is that they don’t show if the guns used were registered (and therefore legally acquired) or stolen/black market.</p>

<p>If that would be the case, then imagine what a crime ridden country the US would be without guns. I doubt it has a significant effect.</p>

              <p>Some facts: The US is <span class="hashtag">#46</span> on the list Bowser jr linked to, the one with weapons per million citizens, and the Netherlands is <span class="hashtag">#47</span>. So the Netherlands would make a good candidate to compare the US with.</p>
<p>The Netherlands is also one place behind the US when it comes to total crimes per capita. But when you look at homicides with firearms, the US is listed <span class="hashtag">#7</span>, and the Netherlands isn’t even on the list (which includes 32 countries). Murders with firearms: US is <span class="hashtag">#8</span>, and the Netherlands is not on the list (of 32). Murders per capita (all murders): US <span class="hashtag">#24</span>, the Netherlands <span class="hashtag">#51</span>.</p>
<p>Before I drown you with facts (I hope they are based on real numbers, and not pulled out of someones arse), I’ll give my first opinion/assumption/whatever: Although the Dutch have almost as many guns as the Americans have, they don’t seem to use them against other human beings. The reason: we’re only allowed to own guns with a permit (I’ll look into the requirements later), and when we own a gun, we’re only allowed to use them on a shooting range. When transporting the gun, we have to disassemble it, and keep it in a briefcase. We also have to store our guns in a safe. If we don’t, and the gun is used in a crime, we’re responsible too.</p>
<p>So that’s one way too look at it. An other way to look at the differences is that although guns are used to kill people in the Netherlands, it mostly happens in the circles of organized crime. There are some murders not related to organized crime, but most are.</p>
<p>I can also bring up the argument that in the Netherlands, the social welfare is better than in the US. I can’t show any numbers proving this argument, but I have a strong feeling it helps.</p>
