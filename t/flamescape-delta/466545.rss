    <title>FlameScape - Delta</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/flamescape-delta/466545</link>
    <description>Hello, everyone. 
I have decided to create a Delta-Scape server that has no customs of any revision higher than 317. By that, I mean that the only customs you will find within this server are those that, within the included Cache, are nulls (such as skillcapes when i began). I also apologize in advance if I have taken a server&#39;s name from anyone, and if this is something you wish to have sorted out, simply send me a PM and we can get this sorted out.  :D
I am proud to have gotten this far in one day, being that I haven&#39;t used Java in well over 2 months at the day of this post. Now, enough of all the formal chat, and let&#39;s get to the stuff you guys came into this topic for in the first place. Pictures/Screenshots will be added soon.

*Goals*

[ul][li]To create a professional-looking 317 server[/li]
[li]At some point, have a full development team (when I feel I am ready for one, I will post)[/li]
[li]Have fun learning to code with Java in it&#39;s simplest form[/li]
[li]While keeping whoever wishes to keep up with this server, I hope to become known within the MoparScape community[/li][/ul]


*Achieved*
What Has Been Completed = Green
What Has Been Started = Orange
What Has Not Been Started = Red

Unlimited Run Energy For Mod+, and Timed Run Energy For Players
Pickup Command Being Able To Recognize More Than 4 Numbers (ex. ::pickup 13549 1)
Lumbridge Home and Respawn After Death (BentonSoft&#39;s death respawn locks you at Burthope Castle)
Crystal Key Chest, Mystery Boxes, The Like
Christmas Event
 A new base of fletching 
Teleportation Ability Within Magic Tabs
At Least 3 Modified Items For Admin+ Worthy Of It
Working ::players Command with Interface
Custom method in itemUsed packets for creating a dragon Square Shield
100% Functional Lumbridge Castle Doors


I have begun a development log for FlameScape. Of course, I will not be able to update the MoparScape development log every day, because of school, soccer and my personal life. But, within my source I keep a log than I plan to have updated daily, and will put that log onto this topic whenever I get the chance.

[center]THE FLAMESCAPE DEVELOPMENT LOG[/center]
Development Log for FlameScape V1
Created by: 1:MoparScape: owner-x
	    2:Rune-Server: johnjohnjohn123
	    3:RuneScape: blue_sar4



[code]Day 1: 11/9/2012

1. Downloaded the blank client and source, courtesy of Bentonsoft (moparscape).
2. Changed the ip&#39;s to my own.
3. Cleaned every command within the source, unless I missed one or seven.
4. Added a bunch of fun commands for the server. Also, Flame is the owner account.
5. SERVER IS UP AND RUNNING. ABLE TO SUCCESFULLY LOG IN WITHOUT TROUBLE.
6. I fell to common demand and decided to add the &#39;perfect&#39; ring. 
7. Staffzone added at an area known as &quot;Hope Bridge.&quot; I feel much potential here.
8. Inspiried by Bentonsoft&#39;s ::cart command, I have added a ::cartoff command.
9. Took note of bugged skillcapes. I am currently editting them.
10. Changed Bentonsoft&#39;s Quest Tab Template and added my credentials.
11. Changed the information on the Login Screen (Client) to say FlameScape&#39;s information in the [New User] screen, and changed the &quot;Welcome to RuneScape&quot; text to say &quot;Welcome to the FlameScape Beta.&quot;
		*END OF DAY 1 OF THE FLAMESCAPE V1 DEVELOPMENT LOG*[/code]

[code]Day 2: 11/10/12

1. Fully functional ::players command with interface (I must admit that I borrowed some snippets from Bentonsoft, but I have tweaked it to the point that it is original.
2. Ability to craft dragon square shields from using left and right halves on each other.

               *END OF DAY 2 OF THE FLAMESCAPE V1 DEVELOPMENT LOG*[/code]

[code]Day 3: 11/11/12

1. Added 100% functional Lumbridge Castle doors throughout the castle.
2. Began working on a starter for when new players log in. (suggestions?)
3. Began the job of mystery boxes and crystal keys.
4. Discovered I didn&#39;t completely remove the woodcutting base, as &quot;logs&quot; are replaced with 25k per cut, ammounting to 300k each tree
5. Began a new fletching base, just need to work out some simple bugs.
6. My own version of potion handling begins. This process is taking me 2 hours already.
7. Added a universal examine system. This way, there are no &quot;It is an (object.item)&quot; examines within the server. [/code]

[code] Day 4: 11/12/12

1. Complete Potions Formula!
2. On the top of the screen, a thing that says FlameScape Beta &amp; Players Online
3. Login Message from NPC - Welcome to FlameScape!
4. Fixed Woodcutting System, now gives logs!
5. Crappy FireMaking base started!
6. Teleports are now shown and working in Magic Tab!
7. Training zone set up, needs work.
8. Prayer is now set up and working, giving reasonable xp per bone, even dragon bones work!
9. New login screen, custom backround.
10. Explosive Potions now damage when dropped.
11. Basic thieving system now set up.
12. Basic drops set up for men, and some dragons, knights, etc.
13. Ape Atoll teleport set up with a quest that I give 100% credits to Lankioras for. [/code]

[code] Day X of Development Log* :
1. Fixed [i]every[/i] teleport in the mage tab, so instead of all these crappy interfaces and/or no teleport at all occurring, I have fixed and/or added teleports to the correct locations (by this I mean what they would have been in RuneScape)
2. Got back to the death scenarios, and changed the death respawn to home with a message saying &quot;Oh, you died.&quot;
3. Fixed a login bug where the login button would send you back to the welcome screen.
4. Thieving stalls now give increments of 50k-250k, depending on the stall and level requirements.
5. Added working whip with special attack.
 [/code]

*I will no longer be posting dates on the development log, due to excessive school work and personal life getting in the way. From now on, I will just add a log that states what I have accomplished in that general time period.*


[b][center]Thank you to all who have read, and if you have any suggestions or complaints, feel free to comment and/or send me a PM!  ;D[/center]

EDIT: Figured that I should begin credits now, and will constantly be changing them as I go:

[ul][li]Me (Owner-X)[/li]
[li]BentonSoft (OP of the blank DeltaScape source I started with [thanks mate  :P][/li]
[li]Team_Rocket[/li]
[li]MoparScape (for tutorials)[/li][/ul]

*Percentages Will Be Added When I Feel That FlameScape Is Acceptable Enough In Its Position That I Can Call It Complete.</description>

<p>EDIT: Rocket, the reason there haven’t been any <span class="bbcode-i">BIG</span> updates is because the OP of this delta deleted most of the essential files needed to create some important updates that you would expect, such as potions, where you go when you die, etc.</p>

If you find DalaCity too rewriten, consider it as a different base. me and rand call it PZ as PZ was the base (A highly edited delta called Project Zeta made by rand also). If you find it too hard, consider <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,565200.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Absillion</a> or <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,542022.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Utopia</a>.</p>

I’d love to hear about your idea. I’m sort of a go-to-guy when it comes to things like this. Also, your Developmental Log could be much better. All of those Updates are simple, poorly detailed, and basically just say you moved some things around. Also edited some values. I suppose this can be overlooked, seeing as how this is the first day of It’s Development. Send me a Private Message about your idea though, I’m all ears and will help you.<br>

I don’t know about you, or anyone else for that matter, but in my past developments I logged everything no matter how small. I do believe it’s the little things that mean the most. With this being said, the development log will most likely ‘improve’ as his development progresses.</p>
<p>Also, Team_Rocket is a very creative, imaginative person. As he stated above, he’s the go-to-guy when it comes to creativity. If you told him your ideas (assuming you haven’t already, you may want to. Knowing TR he will most likely provide you with tips on how to improve them.</p>
<p>As for this project, I wish you the best of luck and you have gained my support.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you for your support. Yes, you should detail and log EVERYTHING no matter how small it is.</p>
<p>On Topic: Thank you for the Credits, I appreciate it. You know where to find me when you need me.</p>

              <p>Hello, everyone.<br>
I have decided to create a Delta-Scape server that has no customs of any revision higher than 317. By that, I mean that the only customs you will find within this server are those that, within the included Cache, are nulls (such as skillcapes when i began). I also apologize in advance if I have taken a server’s name from anyone, and if this is something you wish to have sorted out, simply send me a PM and we can get this sorted out.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I am proud to have gotten this far in one day, being that I haven’t used Java in well over 2 months at the day of this post. Now, enough of all the formal chat, and let’s get to the stuff you guys came into this topic for in the first place. Pictures/Screenshots will be added soon.</p>
<p><em>Goals</em></p>
<p>[ul][li]To create a professional-looking 317 server[/li]<br>
[li]At some point, have a full development team (when I feel I am ready for one, I will post)[/li]<br>
[li]Have fun learning to code with Java in it’s simplest form[/li]<br>
[li]While keeping whoever wishes to keep up with this server, I hope to become known within the MoparScape community[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><em>Achieved</em><br>
What Has Been Completed = Green<br>
What Has Been Started = Orange<br>
What Has Not Been Started = Red</p>
<p>Unlimited Run Energy For Mod+, and Timed Run Energy For Players<br>
Pickup Command Being Able To Recognize More Than 4 Numbers (ex. ::pickup 13549 1)<br>
Lumbridge Home and Respawn After Death (BentonSoft’s death respawn locks you at Burthope Castle)<br>
Crystal Key Chest, Mystery Boxes, The Like<br>
Christmas Event<br>
A new base of fletching<br>
Teleportation Ability Within Magic Tabs<br>
At Least 3 Modified Items For Admin+ Worthy Of It<br>
Working ::players Command with Interface<br>
Custom method in itemUsed packets for creating a dragon Square Shield<br>
100% Functional Lumbridge Castle Doors</p>
<p>I have begun a development log for FlameScape. Of course, I will not be able to update the MoparScape development log every day, because of school, soccer and my personal life. But, within my source I keep a log than I plan to have updated daily, and will put that log onto this topic whenever I get the chance.</p>
<p>[center]THE FLAMESCAPE DEVELOPMENT LOG[/center]<br>
Development Log for FlameScape V1<br>
Created by: 1:MoparScape: owner-x<br>
2:Rune-Server: johnjohnjohn123<br>
3:RuneScape: blue_sar4</p>
<p>[code]Day 1: 11/9/2012</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloaded the blank client and source, courtesy of Bentonsoft (moparscape).</li>
<li>Changed the ip’s to my own.</li>
<li>Cleaned every command within the source, unless I missed one or seven.</li>
<li>Added a bunch of fun commands for the server. Also, Flame is the owner account.</li>
<li>SERVER IS UP AND RUNNING. ABLE TO SUCCESFULLY LOG IN WITHOUT TROUBLE.</li>
<li>I fell to common demand and decided to add the ‘perfect’ ring.</li>
<li>Staffzone added at an area known as “Hope Bridge.” I feel much potential here.</li>
<li>Inspiried by Bentonsoft’s ::cart command, I have added a ::cartoff command.</li>
<li>Took note of bugged skillcapes. I am currently editting them.</li>
<li>Changed Bentonsoft’s Quest Tab Template and added my credentials.</li>
<li>Changed the information on the Login Screen (Client) to say FlameScape’s information in the [New User] screen, and changed the “Welcome to RuneScape” text to say “Welcome to the FlameScape Beta.”<br>
<em>END OF DAY 1 OF THE FLAMESCAPE V1 DEVELOPMENT LOG</em>[/code]</li>
</ol>
<p>[code]Day 2: 11/10/12</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fully functional ::players command with interface (I must admit that I borrowed some snippets from Bentonsoft, but I have tweaked it to the point that it is original.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to craft dragon square shields from using left and right halves on each other.</p>
<pre><code>        *END OF DAY 2 OF THE FLAMESCAPE V1 DEVELOPMENT LOG*[/code]
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[code]Day 3: 11/11/12</p>
<ol>
<li>Added 100% functional Lumbridge Castle doors throughout the castle.</li>
<li>Began working on a starter for when new players log in. (suggestions?)</li>
<li>Began the job of mystery boxes and crystal keys.</li>
<li>Discovered I didn’t completely remove the woodcutting base, as “logs” are replaced with 25k per cut, ammounting to 300k each tree</li>
<li>Began a new fletching base, just need to work out some simple bugs.</li>
<li>My own version of potion handling begins. This process is taking me 2 hours already.</li>
<li>Added a universal examine system. This way, there are no “It is an (object.item)” examines within the server. [/code]</li>
</ol>
<p>[code] Day 4: 11/12/12</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete Potions Formula!</li>
<li>On the top of the screen, a thing that says FlameScape Beta &amp; Players Online</li>

<p>[code] Day X of Development Log* :</p>
<ol>
<li>Fixed <span class="bbcode-i">every</span> teleport in the mage tab, so instead of all these crappy interfaces and/or no teleport at all occurring, I have fixed and/or added teleports to the correct locations (by this I mean what they would have been in RuneScape)</li>
<li>Got back to the death scenarios, and changed the death respawn to home with a message saying “Oh, you died.”</li>
<li>Fixed a login bug where the login button would send you back to the welcome screen.</li>
<li>Thieving stalls now give increments of 50k-250k, depending on the stall and level requirements.</li>
<li>Added working whip with special attack.<br>
[/code]</li>
</ol>
<p><em>I will no longer be posting dates on the development log, due to excessive school work and personal life getting in the way. From now on, I will just add a log that states what I have accomplished in that general time period.</em></p>
<p>[b][center]Thank you to all who have read, and if you have any suggestions or complaints, feel free to comment and/or send me a PM!  ;D[/center]</p>
<p>EDIT: Figured that I should begin credits now, and will constantly be changing them as I go:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Me (Owner-X)[/li]<br>
[li]BentonSoft (OP of the blank DeltaScape source I started with [thanks mate  :P][/li]<br>
[li]Team_Rocket[/li]<br>
[li]MoparScape (for tutorials)[/li][/ul]</p>
