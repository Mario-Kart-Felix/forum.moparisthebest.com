    <title>Changing what commands a rank can access</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-what-commands-a-rank-can-access/341559</link>
    <description>Hi people, got a problem.

I want to change the event-staff rank into a developer rank. The problem is changing what commands the event staff can access. How do I do it? The mudclient doesn&#39;t let me change it and the commandhandler won&#39;t let me change what the event staff can access either. I can change what each command does but not who can use the command.  :confused:

Any help would be appreciated, thanks guys.</description>

I always made it

Player Class defines what rank has the same acces. If you want event/dev rank to have the same acces as a administrator you will have to add the rank to the admin privilage.</p>
<p>What I think is annoying [And I did make 'em seperated] that mute/sub/admin/mod .etc.etc.etc… The all use the so called “RANK” By making it use mute=1/0  sub=1/0 you wont have the problem while muting and demuting someone ingame. I mean when You mute someone you get a new rank number 6 or 7 and if you subscruber then you will be regular player after you been unmuted.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Thats not hard to fix…<br>
Rewrite the mute command to check for subs and have it change to a different ranking number like 9 if they are a sub, then for unmuting have it check for the new ranking number and if it is true have it change back to the normal sub rank.<br>
:D[/quote]</p>
<p>Didn’t say I couldn’t do it, I was just pointing out how annoying it is, I made it a long time ago already.</p>
<p>And you need to chnage more then a command <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>to make it easiser for myself I have made it like this</p>
<p>mute=0<br>
Subscriber=0</p>
<p>Then I took 'em out from the rank, Also had to rewrite the method in world class ad player class.</p>

<p>Any commands under this can only be used by rank event or higher so by moving this statement you can define what commands event teams can use.</p>
