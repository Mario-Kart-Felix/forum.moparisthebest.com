    <description>Hey Guys,

I recently tried to make a server, but for some strange reason when i enter the 43594 ports for it to allow traffic from , I keep on getting and error telling me that they are INVALID ports. I am currently running on a Belkin Wireless Router, Also, If anyone could tell me how to change the port that I run my server on, so then possibly I may be able to forward to an available port.

Many Thanks :][br][size=1]Posted on: July 28, 2007, 03:04:46 PM[/size][hr]There Has GOT to be SOMEONE out there That Can HELP! ME!!!![br][size=1]Posted on: July 28, 2007, 03:37:05 PM[/size][hr]SOMEONE PLEASE. JUST TELL ME HOW I CAN CHANGE WHAT PORT TO RUN MY SERVER ON!</description>
