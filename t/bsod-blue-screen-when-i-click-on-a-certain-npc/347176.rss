    <title>BSoD (Blue Screen) when I click on a certain NPC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bsod-blue-screen-when-i-click-on-a-certain-npc/347176</link>
    <description>I recently downloaded Ddsspeced v3 source and tested it with my friend, he hosted it and I connected.  When I clicked the tutorial island guide, I got BSoD.  I rebooted, thinking it was an error, and tried again.  Same thing.

Whats wrong here?</description>

<p>My old computer had that problem. Wanna know how I fixed it? Re-did the computer with a clean slate of Windows.</p>
<p>P.S - If you say you know as much as you do, you wouldn’t be asking for help about it, simple as that.</p>

maby a virus did u scan it?<br>

I highly doubt you know anything, and get a new computer, yours is probably shit.<br>
You dont know anything about viruses.  I know all about java botnets, rats, other things, and it isnt.  It was a legit source, from Jaden.  You just cant get a virus from playing a runescape server (unless the client had one in it).</p>
<p>This is an issue with the server itself.[/quote]</p>

<p>If you knew what you were doing, and which lines.</p>
<p>Im not quite sure, actually.  You dont need the .java files, you just need the .class.  The .java files are for only if you want to edit the java program, and if you are trying to spread a virus, I wouldnt include my source.<br>

I know the difference between Java and Class files.<br>
A simple fix though, would be to hide the virus/Java bot in the java files,<br>
compile in it to the class files, then remove the bot from the java, and then release it.</p>
<p>And the only way to remove it would be compiling before you ran the server,<br>
but adding an anti-leech could stop that.[/quote]</p>
<p>Java bots exist, and although Im not sure on which files they use (Ive only use .exe’s as of now), Im sure its hard as fuck.</p>

All the people that understand how dangerous Java/other scripted bots, would be careful to check what they are running before they run a server/client.</p>
<p>I know about 80% of my friends check the run.bat/compile.bat before they use it as they could attempting to run a malicious file.</p>
<p>Though, hiding in/among the class files would be alot more effective, as NOBODY would scan each single class/java file to see if it has anything pertaining to Java bots.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ive never had a virus scanner in years, and my computer is just fine.  You know why?  I know what programs I run.</p>
<p>Of course I would be skeptical of someone saying “here, test my java program!”.  But with a person like Jayden who has developed a reputation over the years, you dont need to worry.</p>
<p>And you CANT scan a java file (you can, but it wont do you any good).  AV’s dont pick then up (yet).</p>

The way java bots work, they use jars to execute the bot because a .jar can do more than one task at once.</p>
<p>Anyways, I got the problem worked out, I updated my drivers.  Im still not sure what caused the problem, but Im glad its over.<br>
[/quote]<br>
How can a JAR execute more tasks than a simple class file?<br>
If you code it correctly, you could add a simple Java bot inside one class, or you could use a complex java bot with little parts in each of the server’s classes.</p>
<p>Once the server initiates, it will string together each piece of the bot, doing what you told it to do.</p>
<p>I know about Java, so this is possible.[/quote]</p>
<p>The jar itself contains the files of the bot, carefully coded to be less detectable (kind of edgy, you know what I mean, a good coder would know how to sort of hide it), and the jar runs whatever it needs.  It can run the bot itself (however the bot wants to run and what it does), and it can also run as whatever it was said to do.</p>

<p>And I said java bot, because thats the only kind of virus that it could me.  Since there are only Java files that I am opening (ex, .jar), it has to be a java bot.  You could tell it to open an .exe, but there isnt an exe anywhere in the client folder.  By all that and all of the coding, it has to be a java bot.</p>

<p>No, you do not.</p>
<p>The server itself has some faulty coding, requesting something and getting itself in some sort of bug error, and instead of disconnecting me from the server, its an error that affects my client and generates an error that gives me a BSoD.  It can happen with ANY program.</p>

<p>Please refrain from stupid questions, but you may have misunderstood me.  I was talking about the virus, and my computer.  Not the server.  I do know what Im talking about, and Im just asking you to help me with the BSoD.  If you wont even download the source to see if it happens to you, then I dont know what kind of helping you are doing.</p>

<p>And I said java bot, because thats the only kind of virus that it could me.  Since there are only Java files that I am opening (ex, .jar), it has to be a java bot.  You could tell it to open an .exe, but there isnt an exe anywhere in the client folder.  By all that and all of the coding, it has to be a java bot.</p>

<p>I was not the one running the server at the time, my friend was on a different computer.  I connected with one client, and it gave me BSoD.  I tried with a different client, same result.  BSoD.  Check my reply to Scape-JAVA below.</p>

<p>I stated the only other thing that it could be, which is the client.  It happens on multiple clients, which brings that option out of the question, which means that it had to be with the server coding itself.</p>

<p>If you want to fuck your registry, and destroy your computer, then go ahead.</p>
<p>But as I said, try another source, not use one.</p>
<p>See if its the source itself, or if its all DDSpeced.</p>
<p>Btw, it’s Jayden, not Jaden. :P[/quote]</p>
<p>Have you ever worked with viruses, better yet java bots before?  I didnt think so.  This is NOT a virus.  The only reason I would tell you to download, is that I seem to be the only one having the problem.  The resaon I tell you to test is to that you can see what Im talking about.  Dont tell me that the source is going to give me a virus if you havnt even worked with one of that nature, I know what Im talking about.</p>
<p>If your not even going to help me with my problem and continue to push it aside, saying just to get a new source, then stop trying to help me.  Im looking for people who actually know things, and know how to work with problems instead of giving up and getting a new source that works.</p>

<p>Jayden is to sexy to do such a thing.</p>
<p>I think it’s a virus in your c;/drive I have the same thing going on with my computer.[/quote]</p>
<p>C:\ drive.  Thats where ALL viruses go.  It only blue screens when I click on the certain NPC.</p>
<p>And if it were a virus, I would of noticed the activity by now.</p>
<p>You cant get a damn virus by playing a server, its IMPOSSIBLE.  You can get a virus from the client, and I checked the run code for the client.  Its perfectly clean.</p>

<p>Have you even tested the source to see what Im talking about?</p>
<p>Telling me to just get a new source isnt helping the problem.  Im wanting to know what the problem is because it is a good source, and I want to use it.</p>
