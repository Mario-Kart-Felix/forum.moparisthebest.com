    <title>What the hell.. No answer to any query</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-the-hell-no-answer-to-any-query/139142</link>
    <description>I made a query that I was stuck in runescape, I am still stuck and no help. This is what they replied to it.
It doesn&#39;t give any info on what to do, all it says is that you should be a member go to quest and all that.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Kaelee Marie,

Thank you for contacting RuneScape Customer Support.

At Jagex we always aim to respond to every message we receive from our players individually and as quickly as possible.

Unfortunately, due to the massive growth in popularity of RuneScape and the increasing number of queries that brings, we have not been able to keep up, and are not able to offer a personal response this time. We are increasing the size of our customer support unit and hopefully the next time you need help you will be able to get a quick answer!

We always give priority to answering all member queries personally, but we are now aiming to answer more free player queries. This number will increase even more in the coming weeks.

Why not consider becoming a member and help support the continued development of the game? Plus you&#39;ll also get a range of extra features and benefits like four extra bank pages, exclusive quests and you get no adverts that can sometimes put you off your game.
As a Member you also get access to the Forums which can usually answer any query you have allowing you more time to play the game.

Furthermore, RuneScape.com has a wealth of information available to players in the knowledge base section. You will find the answers to most questions in here, whether it be billing, technical, or game related.

Once again, many thanks for your query, and apologies that we cannot give a personal response at this time.


Hope this answers your query.

Don&#39;t forget to use the RuneScape Knowledge Base to find the answer to your queries quicker.

You can also find help on all free player and all new member quests through the QuestHelp system.

Yours Sincerely
Mod Heaton&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
