    <description>[size=36pt][b]Project Notebook #2[/b][/size]

Any more feedback on changes from the last project will be updated in this thread.

[b]Please also make sure to review the rules. Most of them are copy and pasted but a few have been updated.[/b]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This thread is now continuing this thread: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,480803.0.html]www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,480803.0.html[/url]

As most of you know, the last project was ruined after months of patience and hard work. It&#39;s time to move onto Project Notebook #2, where hopefully procrastination and distrust will not be present.

[b]Before entering, please remember that these four rules were added:[/b]

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you are an entry applicant, five judges will be determining if you are allowed in or not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You have 10 days to send the notebook from after you receive it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You understand that ruining or harming this project in anyway can and will result in a ban.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;YOU MUST POST PHOTO EVIDENCE WHEN YOU RECEIVE AND SEND THE NOTEBOOK. THIS CAN BE A CAMERA PHOTO, TRACKING RECEIPT, ETC.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[size=18pt]Information you need to know about sending the notebook:[/size]

1. You are expected to write in and send the notebook within[u] ten (10) days[/u] of receiving it. Do not let procrastination enter this project again. Do not join this project if you do not have the availability of fast shipping or the funds to cover shipping by the time you receive the notebook.

2. Find out their address ahead of time - We do not want to be in a habit of receiving the notebook and THEN asking the person&#39;s address. Ask the person you are sending it to ahead of time to make things move faster.

3. Make sure you are giving the correct information! Double-check for any errors and try to get them fixed right away. We don&#39;t want people sending the notebook to an incorrect address without a return label, or the notebook may easily get lost.

4. Respect the notebook. Avoid damaging it at all costs. We want the notebook to be in top shape when it comes back. Use common sense and don&#39;t have food or drinks around the notebook and treat it with care.

5. Respect other people and what they write in the notebook. Do not make comments about other members in the notebook. Do not write on someone else&#39;s pages. Do not write anything illegal or highly inappropriate in the notebook, or there is a good chance your pages will be ripped out before I post the pictures.

6. Be patient. The notebook can take anywhere from 3-6 days to arrive, and probably 8-10 for across-country. Alert your parents to watch out for it if you must, and be prepared to have it.

7. Be creative. You have a full 3 pages of the notebook (one page front and back, the other page the front, etc.) to yourself. You can draw, write quotes, etc. It doesn&#39;t matter. If you want to let other people write on your page for a conversation or something, write that you permit other people writing on your pages. Feel free to attach photos or anything other that is lightweight.

8. Be careful. Like I said before, be careful with the notebook. Do not use markers soak through other pages that don&#39;t belong to you, don&#39;t write on pages that don&#39;t belong to you, and use common sense and care while handling the notebook. We want it to turn out as neat and clean as possible.

9. Be aware. Always be ready for the notebook. Always be aware of changes in schedule. You NEED to be on this thread constantly for updates. I will post if I have updated anything on the main post. If you have a problem that turns up, YOU NEED TO REPORT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!

10. Have fun and let&#39;s complete this project with motivation and maturity.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b][size=18pt]F.A.Q.[/size][/b]

Q: What do we have to do?
A: You will receive a notebook in the mail from the person before you on the final list (after the states have been identified and order has been issued). You are expected to write something in the notebook and send it to the next person on the list. You will need to give your address to the person before you on the list when the time comes.

Q: How many pages do we have in the notebook &amp; what can we write in it?
A: You can use up to 2 pages in the notebook. If you use a permanent marker, do not forget that it soaks through. Use a surface that it won&#39;t matter on. What you write in the notebook is completely up to you. You may draw pictures, write notes, greet other members, attach photos, etc. Nothing illegal or inappropriate please. Anything found to be that will be removed from the notebook before it is sent next.

Q: May I send objects with the notebook?
A: Yes, but you are responsible for the shipping costs. If the person you are sending it to does not want to pay the extra shipping money, be aware that they can keep the object. I would advise not sending them, but it is not anyone&#39;s responsibility if the object is stolen, broken, etc. except yours.

Q: What happens to the notebook when it is sent back to Chassy13?
A: First the results of the notebook will be scanned on a printer or have photos taken of it. I will post these on this thread. After that, the notebook will either be sent to MITB as a gift (if he okay with it) or a giveaway will be taken place for it. Although I am the creator of the project, I do not want to claim the notebook for myself as the same thing caused an issue in the Project Notebook mitb tried.

Q: Will it cost anything?
A: You will need to go to the post office and possibly get it weighed depending on the method of shipping they offer. Shipping costs are around $2-5 for across-state and around $8-10 for Australia/New Zealand. I am not sure about the U.K., but it should be close to the same price as Australia/New Zealand. We will need several people that are willing (and can probably get a few donations) to pay the fee to ship to Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K.

Q: What if I don&#39;t want to release my address?
A: The address can be sent privately to the previous person sending it to you. Any untrusted people will be hopefully kicked from the project, but your address will NOT be released. If you are that concerned, use an address that is not personal, such as a friend&#39;s house or public place that you can pick up the package from.

Q: How long until this project starts?
A: The project will begin when the final members have been chosen, their states identified, and the order of mailing issued. I will begin by sending the notebook.

Q: What if someone doesn&#39;t play their role?
A: Nothing we can do about that. This whole thing will be based upon trust. You will be expected to tell people important information along with playing your role and contributing.</description>

I think there is a receipt or ticket of some sort that you are meant to receive from the post office in which you take a photo of and post here to confirm that everything went smoothly on your end.

              <p>Next time this thing starts up again, each time it gets passed on the person holding it should try to scan it while they have it. I mean honestly I feel like a lot of this “not enough time” that keeps happening is just a bunch of BS. I have 16+ hours of internship, a full Master’s program, and a fiance + family to boot and I manage to take a few hours of my time every so often to just sit on my arse and screw around on the laptop.</p>
<p>If everyone takes the time do the project properly, and tries to scan the pages that have been received up to their page, then this project would be fool proof. Idk about everyone else but the excitement of seeing a fully finished notebook loses its luster when its been stolen twice already.</p>

              <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>My sincere apologies for going completely MIA! Davidi2’s theory probably started to become a realistic probability to some of you… I will definitely be trying to open up some more time to return to the forums, I’ve just been really swamped lately to be able to do anything productive here.</p>
<p>The project went downhill and I became less active on a computer in general. I was focusing on the last month of summer before school. Once I got into school, I have been extremely busy every single day. I won’t use that as an excuse for not even being to log in however. That is completely my fault for not giving you guys an update that I’m breathing. I am attending a university with Software Engineering as my major. I’m just starting out with C++ and having a great time in college. My girlfriend attends a university 2 hours away so most weekends I drive there, or she drives home to stay with me. I’m doing well in school and my relationship is going well too. That’s just a little update on what I’ve been up to and how I’m doing, since I was pretty active here before I completely dropped off.</p>
<p>If you guys would like to begin a 3rd project, we need to find a solid plan. This shouldn’t have failed twice. The U.S. postal system is not that unreliable. We need to agree on a set of rules. We set better guidelines this time, but we never enforced them. Let’s make an enforced, precise, and achievable plan this time around get this project finished to prove to everyone we are capable of sending mail after the age of 15.</p>
<p>In case of being busy, I will provide the next project’s participants with my school e-mail address.</p>
<p>Thoughts? Questions?</p>
<p>Any personal questions can be PM’d to me. Please keep this thread related to the project only. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Since Chassy has been MIA, what should I do about the notebook?</p>
<ul>
<li>Reimbursement of shipping fees</li>
<li>Send out a new notebook</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m asking for serious answers, anyone that spams will be muted.</p>
