    <title>The owner of this city (Or members) + other</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-owner-of-this-city-or-members-other/391515</link>
    <description>I would like some members of the below city to please come forward and clarify your intentions as a group of people. 

[IMG]http://i293.photobucket.com/albums/mm78/5frtgvhy/citywallcondry.jpg[/img]

I can never seem to catch you in game, but I&#39;m almost certain some of you browse this forum. I&#39;m not happy about the building of walls around my territory (In the black outlines boxes). I was here before the lot of you and you all turn up and start locking me in my own grounds. It&#39;s also obvious you plan on extend the wall all around the city which would breach my property. 

I hope we can come to some agreement.  You&#39;ve also built your city on my underground networks which also wasn&#39;t a very good thing to do. I will try to contact you all further in game. I&#39;ve been very understanding and patient up to now, and only killed one of you but it has gotten to a point where my resources are being mined by people who are stumbling onto my grounds it also isn&#39;t helping because the city has brought forest fires which destroyed every single tree. 

I&#39;d also like to hear other peoples opinions on city building, this can range from: Can you just build a city where ever you like, or should you ask permission of the people who lived there first? etc..

Just like to add, I have other bases which are currently not marked on as I don&#39;t intend to give away my position.</description>

<p>I did hear Divine saying he wanted to build a city, so you might want to talk to him. Also, you can’t even seem my house on there as it’s further north, and my caves are north as well. (I went north because if I went south, i’d run into you lot.)</p>

<p>And then the other players will accuse him of griefing. He would lose his credibility as a moderator and be banned at the same time.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’re implying in setting their city on fire.</p>

<p>I can never seem to catch you in game, but I’m almost certain some of you browse this forum. I’m not happy about the building of walls around my territory (In the black outlines boxes). I was here before the lot of you and you all turn up and start locking me in my own grounds. It’s also obvious you plan on extend the wall all around the city which would breach my property.</p>
<p>I hope we can come to some agreement.  You’ve also built your city on my underground networks which also wasn’t a very good thing to do. I will try to contact you all further in game. I’ve been very understanding and patient up to now, and only killed one of you but it has gotten to a point where my resources are being mined by people who are stumbling onto my grounds it also isn’t helping because the city has brought forest fires which destroyed every single tree.</p>
<p>I’d also like to hear other peoples opinions on city building, this can range from: Can you just build a city where ever you like, or should you ask permission of the people who lived there first? etc…</p>
<p>Just like to add, I have other bases which are currently not marked on as I don’t intend to give away my position.</p>
