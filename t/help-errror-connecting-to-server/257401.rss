    <title>[Help] Errror connecting to server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-errror-connecting-to-server/257401</link>
    <description>Problem explanation: I am trying to connect to my server [through MY ip AND no-ip address to test] (have already tried having friends test, they can&#39;t connect either) and I/we can&#39;t connect, but when I try to connect to my server through localhost..it works. When I click connect..nothing comes up on the runserver.bat window..its just a quick..error connecting to server.


EDIT: I AM USING A DODIAN BASED SOURCE -WITH MYSQL. THE MYSQL IS WORKING, I HAVE HAD USERS ON IT BEFORE AND EVERYTHING WENT FINE. -I am just now coming back to private servers and now nobody can connect.
