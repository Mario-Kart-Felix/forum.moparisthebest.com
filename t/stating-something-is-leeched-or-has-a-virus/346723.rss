    <title>Stating something is leeched or has a virus</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stating-something-is-leeched-or-has-a-virus/346723</link>
    <description>if you state that something is leeched please provide proof or don&#39;t say it is leeched at all. because every server is not leeched unless PROVEN.

if you comment on a source/client that was released and claim it was leeched and provide no proof then you are flaming it, and if you read the rules thoroughly and carefully then you would know this.

so therefore don&#39;t claim something is leeched unless you have proof, and not just a small similarity it should be very similar to another server (at least 7 similarities)

and that same thing with viruses if you claim it is a virus provide proof or you comment can be considered flaming.

when looking at server i see this on almost every released client/server i see. it is pathetic and needs to stop.

who agrees w/ me?

*****keep bad comments to yourself i don&#39;t want to see them*****</description>
