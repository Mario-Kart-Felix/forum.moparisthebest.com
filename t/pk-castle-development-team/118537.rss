    <description>[center][size=15pt]Welcome to the PK Castle Development Team&#39;s Offical Topic[/size][/center]

[i]This server is going to be huge. What will happen, is you will start out in a training area and you will do a huge quest. The biggest quest ever made in Moparscape, can&#39;t release anymore information due to leachers! I am looking for the following type people for my staff:[/i]

[i][b]Please Note:[/b]The way the team works is that for coders, Once we start the project I will bring in the necessary coders to finish a step of the proccess, then I will call in the other coders, ect. Testers will not be contacted untill the server is compeletly finished. The Testers are the Offical ones, because I will call in some people just to try it out, but the offical testers get the final call on the release date. Forum creaters will start as soon as the coders start, they will work hard to create the forums, and the forum testers and moderators will not be called until the forum is finished!  Rich Dude99&#39;s MSN is: erbeeler@hotmail.com[/i]

<p><span class="bbcode-i">This server is going to be huge. What will happen, is you will start out in a training area and you will do a huge quest. The biggest quest ever made in Moparscape, can’t release anymore information due to leachers! I am looking for the following type people for my staff:</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Please Note:</span>The way the team works is that for coders, Once we start the project I will bring in the necessary coders to finish a step of the proccess, then I will call in the other coders, ect. Testers will not be contacted untill the server is compeletly finished. The Testers are the Offical ones, because I will call in some people just to try it out, but the offical testers get the final call on the release date. Forum creaters will start as soon as the coders start, they will work hard to create the forums, and the forum testers and moderators will not be called until the forum is finished!
