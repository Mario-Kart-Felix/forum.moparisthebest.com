    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-non-hamachi-server-with-bad-isp/234940</link>
    <description> :( PLEASE HELP! Ok I am pretty sure that i have opened all my ports correctly. I am still having a bit of trouble getting people to connect to my server.

You see i have a laptop, and two desktop pc&#39;s.

I PF all ports then i open my server file run.bat (To run the server)

It wont let me connect only my pc can connect

If you have any idea&#39;s why this is happening just reply.

Thank you very much for all of your help  :)</description>
