    <title>What About the Starters?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-about-the-starters/117882</link>
    <description>Ive been looking over the RS2 Server Tutorial board and I see all these tutorials for people who have a good experience in coding. But what about the people who want to make a server and need some basic tutorials for them to use. What are they suppose to do? Plus I need some basic tutorials my self =[.
