    <title>Devolution special bar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/devolution-special-bar/233969</link>
    <description>I feel like a complete idiot posting this. But the special bar on my server (Devolution 7.8) doesn&#39;t go down, lol.

Pretty much means infinite special for all weapons. I don&#39;t want people to rape each other using a Godsword and whatnot.

I find it sad that I can&#39;t figure this out myself.

I&#39;m not asking on how to actually do it, I&#39;m asking for something to point me in the right direction. If you tell me everything that I have to do, I wont learn, so I prefer just getting a few hints, or whatever.</description>
