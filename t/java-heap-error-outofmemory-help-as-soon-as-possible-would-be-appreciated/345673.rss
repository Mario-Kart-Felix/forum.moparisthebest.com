    <title>Java Heap Error - OutofMemory ; Help as Soon as Possible Would be Appreciated</title>

    <description>Unfortunately, I have a problem with a client, at the moment.  

The &quot;Java heap space&quot; outofmemory error is appearing every time I try to log in on someone&#39;s server.

@echo off
title Client
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16\bin\java.exe&quot; Jframe 10 0 highmem members 32
pause

This is exactly what I have inside the run.bat. 

A fast reply, containing helpful information would greatly be appreciated.</description>
