<p>I’ve figured it out bro.  Thanks anyways <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

If you’re making your jar an .exe, you’re going to lose a portion of players.<br>
First off, the jar doesn’t need to be an exe, so it’s a waste of time. Second, there are no “gains” in making it an .exe as anything you’d add in, could just be added to the jar. Third, people don’t trust executables from unknown sources. I personally will not play a RSPS that uses a .exe. I don’t care if they show me the source code to it or even build it in front of me. In 1 update after they showed me, they can add malicious code to it. Yes, the same goes for jar files, you can easily add malicious code to it, but they are easier to decompile and read.</p>
<p>As for making a webclient…<br>
Here’s all I know about that.<br>
When Java 1.7.0_21 was released, they changed everyone’s (who updated) security settings. It made them go from whatever they were on, to high. Normally, it was on medium. Medium allowed self-signed apps (by pulling up that prompt and requesting approval). High does not. High only allows jars that have been signed with a certificate (as cleako said). Now, that wasn’t a “major” issue, as you could just go in the settings and set it to medium again. <span class="bbcode-u">But</span> when Java 1.8 came out (I’m not sure on the exact version), they decided just defaulting the users to high wasn’t enough. And instead, they completely removed the “medium” option. Making high and very high the only two options. Which, again, means no self-signed apps by default.</p>
<p>Solutions to this:<br>
A) Get a certificate (I saw someone on Rune-Server giving some out FOR FREE).<br>
B) Don’t have a webclient. Just make it downloadable (.jar) and continue on.<br>
C) Add some text to your webclient page. A link. It would say something like “Can’t run this webclient? Click me.” this link would take users to a tutorial on how to add your site to their exceptions. Don’t forget to explain that it is NOT your fault, and that java’s security settings changed.</p>
<p>I hope some of this may help.[/quote]</p>

              <p>When Oracle updated java to version 7 update 21, they began requiring signed certificates for applets and blocking unsigned or self signed applets by default. It made webclients not work for most players without manually white listing the domain where the webclient applet was being downloaded from within their java settings. Java code signing certificates from a trusted certificate authority range from $130-$400 per year to buy. Cheapest that I found: <a href="https://www.sslshopper.com/cheap-code-signing-certificates.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.sslshopper.com/cheap-code-signing-certificates.html</a></p>
