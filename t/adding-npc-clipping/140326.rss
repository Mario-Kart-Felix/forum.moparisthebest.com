    <title>Adding NPC clipping?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-npc-clipping/140326</link>
    <description>i did a search for NPC clipping and NPC pathing, and got 0 hits for it...so, im going to ask if there is anyone that knows how to make NPC&#39;s have clipping like a normal player?

for example: (any server with portals leading to far off coordinates)
-you attack an NPC that will follow you indefinitely when attacked
-you warp/go through a portal
-the NPC will home onto you from anywhere, and will get to you so long as you give it enough time.

the above is what i would like to know if it is possible to correct.

if this is just flat out to much coding for someone to do at my request, is there a way to just limit the distance that an NPC will follow you for?

(ps: if this is in the wrong section please move if possible instead of locking)[br][size=1]Posted on: August 27, 2007, 12:05:01 AM[/size][hr]so i guess there&#39;s nothing that can be done about this?</description>

              <p>Not many people know a fix for this (if any), but my suggestion is to mess around with attack within codes and your NPC handler.</p>
