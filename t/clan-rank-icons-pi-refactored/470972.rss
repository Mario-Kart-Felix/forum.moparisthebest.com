    <description>I have recently modified the clan chat base that was on my server so that it has ranks, commands, and that you join it whenever you log back in. I currently only have it saying the rank name; e.g. General. I also have a 459 text engine added so I have the updated image tags; e.g. &lt;img=5&gt;. But when I add that instead of the rank name, it just says that. Any help would be appreciated whether it be server or client sided.</description>
