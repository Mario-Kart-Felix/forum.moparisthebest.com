    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weapon-timer/317873</link>
    <description>i am kind of stuck on this.
like i know were the weapon timers are but for some reason they dont follow the timers.
any help?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 05, 2009, 06:03:11 pm[/size][hr][code]        if (playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (1333)) // rune scimi here
        {
            PkingDelay = 22;
            actionTimer = 22;
        }[/code]
as high as i set these it wont slow down.

[code]        resetAnimation();
        int wepdelay = 0;[/code]
