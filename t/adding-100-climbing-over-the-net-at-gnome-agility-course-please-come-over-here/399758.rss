[code=java]if(objectID == 2286 &amp;&amp; aStage == 0 &amp;&amp; GnomeCourse == 5 &amp;&amp; (absX == 2483 &amp;&amp; absY == 3425) || (absX == 2484 &amp;&amp; absY == 3425) || (absX == 2485 &amp;&amp; absY == 3425) || (absX == 2486 &amp;&amp; absY == 3425) || (absX == 2487 &amp;&amp; absY == 3425) || (absX == 2488 &amp;&amp; absY == 3425)){
addSkillXP(300, 16);
aStage = 1;
isRunning = false;
isRunning2 = false;
agilitytimer = System.currentTimeMillis();
isRunning = false;
isRunning2 = false;
agilitytimer = System.currentTimeMillis();
walkDelay = 1000;
WalkTo(0, +2);
WalkToEmote(3063);
tH = 0;
GnomeCourse = 6;
