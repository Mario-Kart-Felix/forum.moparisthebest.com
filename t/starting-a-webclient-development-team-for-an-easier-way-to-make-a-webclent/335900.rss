    <description>[wip] The webclient project [wip]
Spots available 2.
I had posted a topid once on how to make a webclient &quot;the easy way&quot; with promotionsoft&#39;s web game builder. however i didn&#39;t realize that most webhosts (t35 webhosting is sometimes an exception) do not allow you to use it because it is zipped. I think chmodding is part of the problem but i also want to get some help from actual client coders. I need people who can do both 317 - 508. Just reach me through moparscape pming or my gtalk account (you need to get a gtalk if you wanna chat with me, thewebclient@gmail.com is my  gtalk e-mail). You will recieve a percentage of credit due to the amount of work is enlisted. ELITISTS ONLY. I also need someone to get the full version of web game builder for us, that person would be made a mod on anything that i controll.</description>
