    <title>Second Harddisk is dead :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/second-harddisk-is-dead/454138</link>
    <description>Hello. It&#39;s been quite a while since I&#39;ve posted here. But anyway, here is my problem.

Some months ago my hard-disk died, mainly because of my failure. I had Ubuntu/linux on the 2nd hard-disk and windows on the first. So i tried to install a new version of ubuntu onto the 2nd hard-disk with the ubuntu update manager or something like that. 
My computer froze in the middle of the update because a problem with the graphics card I figured out some time ago. I had no choice back then, than to shut down the computer. That is where the problem is coming from.
I tried to boot up ubuntu onto the hard-disk it is installed on. It just said some boot up thingy was missing and just shut down the computer.
Now I went onto windows and tried to find the hard-disk in the windows file manager. I found the disk but it was unreachable or not able to do anything with it. I tried using a ubuntu live cd, I did find the hard-disk, but was not able to anything to it. It was like a disk you cannot see or touch, it just was there :(

Have any of you that is reading this had any problems like this before? Or do anyone know how to get life back to my beloved hard-disk? I had so many important files on that disk. I still have a hope, a hope that someday the files will be mine again. 

Thank you for reading this. Yours sincerely kneistol :)</description>

              <p>I assume it’s dead becuase it’s not working the way i want it to do. And because it’s not responding in linux or windows. It may just be corrupted.

It turns on spinning. And then all of a sudden it turns off and then turns on again. It keeps doing that for a long time… until it boots up from a cd i have put in. So it makes this “bmffmfmmf” sound and the disk stops spinning. It means there is life in the disk. But something is wrong.<br>

<p>I downloaded a program called “DiskCheckup a SMART way to check your disk” And the only thing it finds is my first harddisk. Th second harddisk won’t show up as a disk. But in device manager the disc is there i believe. Under “DiskDrives” there is my first harddisk and the usb ports. Nothing else. But when I open “other devices” there is a “SCSI Disk Device” there.<br>
I believe that is the dead harddisk. I can open the properties of it. The device is working properly it says. But It’s not <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
Whats happening to it? The SMART program could not find it. The only place I can find it is in device manager. But as a disk i cant reach but is working properly <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>EDIT: If this helps. When i disconnect the normal windows hard-disk. And just plugs in the first one. It turns on spinning. And then all of a sudden it turns off and then turns on again. It keeps doing that for a long time… until it boots up from a cd i have put in. So it makes this “bmffmfmmf” sound and the disk stops spinning. It means there is life in the disk. But something is wrong.</p>
