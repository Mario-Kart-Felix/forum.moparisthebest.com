    <title>People, motivate me, please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/people-motivate-me-please/522145</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;ve just a week or two ago done one of these huge time-consumers, a picture I call &quot;The Shroomery&quot;:
[img]http://i43.tinypic.com/jr5p3q.jpg[/img]

Note: the actual cap of the mushroom is very unfinished, there&#39;s this background of mountains and a sunset missing, and my &quot;almost avatar&quot;; an emo-dog of sorts or maybe just some random dude sittin&#39; on the empty grass spot left to be done.. Maybe a rock beside the mushroom, but the thing is: I&#39;m not willing to finish this without some sort of audience rating the progress!

Could some kind souls give me CONSTRUCTIVE critic, like more than &quot;It&#39;s okay..&quot; or &quot;My eyes are burning! Take that away!&quot; kind of comments would be very appreciated.

Also bear in mind that the original picture is HUGE! Teaser of the actual size of the rock part:
[img]http://i42.tinypic.com/2lscehx.jpg[/img]

Finally, the thing that got me to the point of doubt was the fact that the rocks are way too bright compared to the &#39;shroom!

I promise, LAST NOTE: I&#39;m actually far from emo in appearance... (Just had to clarify, LoL)</description>

              <p>Now that you point out these vines, especially the one most on the right side looks absolutely wrong. This is enough to motivate me to continue. A few days will pass maybe a week and I will try to upload any progress. Just to increase my DeviantArt traffic I’m not going to post the final one on Moparscape.<br>

Thanks to the people who deserve, if you feel you deserve it, have it! It’s free right now, it might be pricey at some point so enjoy it while possible!</p>

              <p>I honestly think it looks nice. The use of colors is very nice in the image, and the stone looks wonderful to me.  But I think the vines hanging down could use a little work, make them more of a curl I think would look a bit better.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s nice to have a comment that isn’t written totally in a cracky state of mind. (Krackkid, feel this as revenge?)</p>
<p>But at the stem, is it the “shiny” left edge that makes you feel this way or maybe the transformation point of the stem to grass which you feel not fitting? I ensure you, I have these on the todo list. Very easy fixes on these both.</p>

              <p>Well played!<br>
Have you changed location from last “Room temperature” measurement? Or maybe you were used to winter?</p>
<p>Well, come on Kracky, anything you want to add?</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, I find it very difficult for me to actually take it away from your visuals. The easiest option would be to remove these but it wouldn’t still serve any purpose to my original idea of posting this. Have a fine time-of-day, sir. And have you considered of maybe changing your current web address? If it hurts your eyes, it would be quite useful to just swap to another topic, right? I encourage you to consider this option. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
