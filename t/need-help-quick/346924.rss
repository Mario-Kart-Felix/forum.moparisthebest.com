    <description>[b]I&#39;ve searched for the answer to fix this error but its nowhere to be found , so I&#39;ll post it here [/b] 

[i]This is my first time going through 508 sources so I may not know how to fix it.
The problem is that after I run the source then the client , the client just turns all white... any idea on how to fix?

Just to know : I already portfowarded correctly , made the compiler and run from client and source work , have a windows 7 laptop , and have java. I know I have all these becuase I&#39;ve made 317 servers and people played. &lt;-- Is there anything more I need to have to run a 508 source?[/i]
