natalie.marshall@my.chamberlain.edu

i need help with port forwarding, getting it online and doing no-ip.
one tutorial said do it through u-torrent. and i did. but i have no one to test if it worked or not.
ive been having problems with it lately because i got people to join with my hamachi and then they would go to log on and it said error connecting to server
even though i know it was online because i was on it while they were trying to get on.
ive watched youtube tutorials and read tutorials on port forwarding but i still dont get it. (unless it worked with utorrent)
i just want to host a 317 without having to do it through hamachi.
please help.
oh and, it would be nice if you could show me how to put stuff at certain coords.
like put the kq in the lair, or set up a staff zone somewhere.
if theres any tutorials please send me the link.
ive looked but i dont know what that is called so i dont know what im looking for.
but mainly!
i need port forwarding, someone to help me see if my client works and is online, and no-ip.
please and THANK YOU if you do.
