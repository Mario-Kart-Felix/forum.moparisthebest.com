[ul][center][b]What is BarrenScape?[/b]
[i]Barrenscape is going to be a development of a deltascape server, that will be cleaned and made blank.[/center]

[center][b]What are the main goals?[/b]
To remove all the unneeded things from this deltasape server.[/center]
[center][b]What are you going to remove?[/b]
See below[/center]

[center][b]What will it be like when it&#39;s done?[/b]
[i]It will be like a really barren server, the only content that will probably be still there is combat.[/i][/center]


[B]Progress[/b]
Means it has been removed / completed
Means it has been started
Means it has not been started
[b]Things to delete[/b]
[list][li][color=blue]Custom Items, objects, npcs[/li]
[li]All skills[/li]
[li]Useless methods[/li][/list]

This list will expand alot, it is only like this because I have only just started on this server.

[b]What it will contain[/b]
[list][li]Alot of the sendquest methods that are not being used(showed as the ID)[/li][/list]
[li]Running / Walking[/li][/ul]

[li]Friends / Ignores list[/li][/list]

Credits(So far)
Runescape Sucks - Cleaning most of the server and the client.
Pblord7 - Giving me the file I needed to fix that bad fence glitch.

<p>Good luck, even though there are a lot of delta cleaned servers and some of which aren’t cleaned. Are you going to improve delta’s combat as well?</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, I’ll try to improve the combat. I’m not guaranteeing anything, but at the least I can try.</p>
