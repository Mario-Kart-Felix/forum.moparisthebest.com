    <title>White knights castle, the screwed up version :( (help meeh )</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/white-knights-castle-the-screwed-up-version-help-meeh/217116</link>
    <description>Well,  have the Testscape source code, i modded it alot.. but now it comes to the part where i&#39;m putting every npc in its place and make sure it works and stuff. The problem is, the white knights castle doesnt work. 

(first up, i don&#39;t want any dumb answers like get another source, that pisses me off..)

My doors in the castle (ID = 11727) are kinda.. working, when i put them vertical that is.

Lets say N is north,
my doors are:

    N             N
    ^             ^
   ___   and    |

the horizontal ones,  ___, arent working, i can only walk trough them in one way, i can walk trough them, walking south, but walking north doesnt work, i just cant walk there, even my yellow cross, you usually see when you walk doesnt appear. 
Has anyone had this error in the past, and how do i fix it?
Thanks for reading, and i hope u can help :|</description>
