    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/99-prayer-party/390990</link>
    <description>Around [s]6pm[/s] GMT i will be holding my 99 prayer party in Varrock Courtyard, world 106 (Free to Play).

Unfortunately it won&#39;t have any kind of drop party or similar as i am rendered flat broke after this venture.

SHOW UP OR I WILL TURM UR ASS

EDIT: 

Delayed to 7PM GMT due to monetary issues and miscalculations @@@@@</description>

What probably happened is that my laptop got RATed, meaning they can control it for their own purposes (in this case to use it as a proxy), or possibly using TOR, as i use that frequently (meaning, someone else can get my IP-address as a proxy). I intend to scan my laptop thoroughly tomorrow to check for any kind of malicious software.</p>

Yeah, I did pay for his 99 prayer. The fact is Spel lost a lot of money and I wanted to help him.<br>
Just to prove that, these are just my winning from these past 2 weeks:<br>

<p>[/quote]Is staking seriously that good money? My friend said he got 100m yesterday but from greediness he ended up with 3m.[/quote]</p>
<p>You have to know a few things before you stake to make money.<br>
The first day free trade came out I made max cash (lost it all to a glitcher but that part isn’t too important)<br>
A general overview is the scams, how to look people up, how much to stake (I usually do 10% and after awhile 10% - 10m), and when your luck has turned around. You also can’t get too mad trying to stake; your rage will overcome you and cause you to just stake the first person you see (I get most of my money from kids who do this). If you know what to do you can make billions or get cleaned.</p>

Don’t be stupid, if you keep getting hacked you should probably clean your computer. I trust Spelj0han, it’s more likely someone is using his computer somehow as a proxy (don’t forget he got hacked too) than he hacked you.</p>
<p>As for the download links, no one else is having a problem, why would it just be you? Specially as you aren’t really a well known member here…<br>

<p>Don’t bother arguing about it on here, just PM me with all of the proof that you have.  Also, I’d need to have an idea how he got your username/password in the first place.</p>

Don’t be stupid, if you keep getting hacked you should probably clean your computer. I trust Spelj0han, it’s more likely someone is using his computer somehow as a proxy (don’t forget he got hacked too) than he hacked you.</p>
