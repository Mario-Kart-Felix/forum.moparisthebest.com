    <description>So the main problems I see these days are:

1) People being confused as hell about environment variables
2) DDoS attacks

How many people would be interested in a tutorial to make somewhat of a &quot;standard&quot; server, run under a virtual machine? Was thinking of using Ubuntu server since it&#39;s basically a LAMP installation (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). After that I would provide a script to set up any environment variables, and to download any extra needed packages (such as Snort for DDoS protection). I&#39;d also configure a rules file for everyone to use with snort to drop any bogus network traffic. The hardest part would probably be getting people&#39;s network set up properly, but the software side of things would be completed. Another benefit of a Virtual Machine is that your own computer is at much less risk than it would be if you opened up your entire system to the network. 

If people are interested, I could probably have a reasonable tutorial within a week&#39;s time, as I&#39;m very busy right now. This would allow for people to have a server up and running very quickly, with the focus on customization instead of networking / setting up XAMPP properly / etc.

<p>The speed would depend on the host machine, but most new-ish machines can run a VMWare machine pretty well.</p>
<p>Vrunk:</p>
<p>I had a crack at installing snort-inline on a deb box yesterday, looks like the problem is in the AIDS ridden deb repository system, the libdnet and libdnet-dev apt-get packages don’t seem to include the correct header files (or they’ve been de-standardised/renamed). Not got around to compiling libdnet from source yet though, box was under a DDoS attack at the time and I wasn’t able to make any new connections, lul.</p>
<p>Anyway, you got anywhere with this? Rule file would be nice once I have snort set-up :).</p>
<p>I could probably seed the VM torrent from my box for a while as well, if needed.</p>

<p>As far as the tutorial, might just be easier to post a VM image, lol.</p>
