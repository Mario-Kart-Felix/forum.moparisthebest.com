<p>I know its not perfect because they dont want them hosted right away. Like most people do. Only the bugs are kinda stupid bugs that shouldnt be their. but i agree with you 100% your not going to find a perfect server that u can host. v4 isnt bad if u know how to fix the bugs in it. and its a decent server to learn how to fix problems and add stuff</p>

<p>if your going to use i would use v2 if u can find it. v3 he updated to new maps and it was very laggy and such, v4 has alot of stuff wrong. i can think off the top of my head the rock crabs/yak tele didnt work and the skill cape shop would lower all your skills down to 98/99 so u could never buy a skillcape</p>
