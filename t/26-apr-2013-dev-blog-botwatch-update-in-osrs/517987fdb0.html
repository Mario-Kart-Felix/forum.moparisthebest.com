my god you’re a little bitch lol</p>
<p>want my explanation for why botting is useful? if it weren’t for botting, there wouldn’t be an abundance of raw materials, and thus 99% of your time would be spent getting a magic shortbow because no one would be around to collect the logs and bowstring in massive amounts</p>
<p>oh and it’d be a huge barter economy because there would be almost no actual gp in the game</p>
<p>BUT WAIT LET ME GUESS! that makes the game perfect because THERE ARE NO BOTS</p>
<p>pls ok</p>
<p>ps: you are extremely close minded if you think there is a universal right/wrong to anything in life<br>
[/quote]It’s so hard not to flame someone like you because your sheer stupidity. Have you ever heard of inflation? Ever heard of the idea that an abundance of something decreases the value? How do you think players who play legitimately feel when they’ve worked hard to achieve something when someone else clicked a couple of times and got to go outside with the same end result?</p>
<p>And regarding your “ps”, what? Did you even read what I said? You are such a moron, it hurts to read your post.[/quote]</p>
<p>You sound like me when I first joined… at the age of 12.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, you might feel accomplished, but in reality all you’ve done is spend hours to grind for something that you can easily buy in the market thanks to the bots. You make it sound like there would be a massive amount of raw materials in-game without bots, when in reality the amount of players who dedicate enough time to skill is almost negligible compared to the amount of bots that do all of that work for you.</p>
<p>Also, you stated that there <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> a right/wrong in the scenario. My point was that everyone is subject to opinion and thus botting can’t be right/wrong.</p>
<p>anyway, seeing as you’re the diehard christianity of this oh-so heated debate, i’ll let you feel accomplished and stop posting <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>The only legitimate way for anyone to be accurately accused of breaking a rule is if the accuser was there at the very scene to see the bot program running on the suspect’s computer screen. The same methodology would apply to real life situations, such as in court trials; some times the innocent get sentenced, either due to a fault in the system or an extreme coincidence in the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>Cheating is seen in real life, and even more drastically in games, so it is much harder to handle every happening. Even though Jagex says they have a bot detection system in play (like they have said for many years now), whether it be in the EoC or OSRS, I believe most of the ban decisions are based upon assumptions made by the system itself.</p>
<p>Also, in regards to everyone saying that cheating is either right or wrong, you are a hypocrite in stating so. It is highly unlikely for a human being to never have cheated before, no matter the severity or the cheat.</p>

<p>i still cannot believe theres an argument on the perceived morality of botting on this forum. private servers were originally used to test bots, particularly aryan iirc. should i also mention that all significant groundwork done in the field of rsps was a by product of botting?</p>
<p>i’ve played rs since around 2003, and i will say that automation is the only way to have fun in the game.</p>
<p>PS: if bots were non-existent, i can guarantee many players would turn to RWT.</p>

        <p>Jagex has a reputation as a failed gaming company. In over 12 years they’ve only shipped one successful title (that being Runescape).<br>
If they didn’t want people to bot then they would make the higher levels more accessible (i.e., adjust the experience given by everything, or change the experience curve so that it isn’t exponential in nature). In doing so, fewer people would reach the ‘love this, I’m just going to bot it’ point.</p>
<p>The other problem is their economy. There are three routes to the best armour, which is now a necessity if you don’t want to be completely outclassed by someone 20 levels lower.<br>
You can spend $150 - $200 USD on the gold (which in Australia, as a professional, can be earned in a working day) OR you can get very very lucky after killing a monster OR you can grind out over 400 hours of gameplay doing something that’s worth at least 1 million gold per hour.<br>
To put that into perspective, 400 hours is over ten weeks of full time work at a job (in Australia, our full time work week is generally 38 hours).</p>
<p>So yes, people are going to cheat in their shitty virtual world.</p>
<p>NOTE: I’ve referred to ‘best armour’ as in the best armour available in EOC Runescape. This armour set is worth more than 400M. My point is still relevant in OSRS though, where there are surely very expensive items that take at least tens of hours of work to afford.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:66, topic:517987”]Jagex has a reputation as a failed gaming company. In over 12 years they’ve only shipped one successful title (that being Runescape).<br>
If they didn’t want people to bot then they would make the higher levels more accessible (i.e., adjust the experience given by everything, or change the experience curve so that it isn’t exponential in nature). In doing so, fewer people would reach the ‘love this, I’m just going to bot it’ point.</p>
<p>The other problem is their economy. There are three routes to the best armour, which is now a necessity if you don’t want to be completely outclassed by someone 20 levels lower.<br>
You can spend $150 - $200 USD on the gold (which in Australia, as a professional, can be earned in a working day) OR you can get very very lucky after killing a monster OR you can grind out over 400 hours of gameplay doing something that’s worth at least 1 million gold per hour.<br>
To put that into perspective, 400 hours is over ten weeks of full time work at a job (in Australia, our full time work week is generally 38 hours).</p>
<p>So yes, people are going to cheat in their shitty virtual world.</p>
<p>NOTE: I’ve referred to ‘best armour’ as in the best armour available in EOC Runescape. This armour set is worth more than 400M. My point is still relevant in OSRS though, where there are surely very expensive items that take at least tens of hours of work to afford.[/quote]<br>
