    <title>[26-Apr-2013] Dev Blog: BotWatch Update in OSRS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/26-apr-2013-dev-blog-botwatch-update-in-osrs/517987</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Botters, especially gold farmers, are a serious threat to RuneScape, and the battle lines in our war against bots have shifted back and forth over the years. Last year we created BotWatch as a new piece of anti-bot technology, and it has been progressively rolled out across the main game. BotWatch allowed us to make significant progress against removing illegitimate players, especially in the last few months. 

As Old School RuneScape is a much earlier version of the game, significant time has been needed to integrate BotWatch into OSRS. However we’re pleased to say the basic BotWatch systems are live in OSRS and we’re beginning to expand its reach across the game. The results have been positive so far, with over 21,000 bans applied in the last two weeks. Of course there is still much more progress that we need to make to significantly bring down the number of bots. Initially we’re prioritizing gold farmers and activities which affect resource competition, hiscores competition and we will continually expand this over time. 

We can be a lot more efficient at this with your help. Thankfully, there are several things you can do: 

Reporting bots - This is crucial to the strength and accuracy of the system. We evaluate every report we receive, taking the data and information from the report to help tune the system ensuring it remains 100% accurate and targets the right offenders. 

Attend bot busts - These aren&#39;t a just lip service – they’re a means to send a very clear message to those who&#39;re botting that not only we, but also the community, are coming after them. We&#39;ve noticed that around the time of bot busts, bot numbers actually drop! These events also allow us to gather more information about bot usage. 

Don&#39;t bot - Bot developers may tell you that they &#39;have the latest way to avoid being detected&#39; and they &#39;offer 100% immunity to bans&#39;. Realistically, you&#39;re playing in our ball park and we have complete control. Running a bot yourself puts your account at great risk, not only from being permanently banned, but from hijacking and the visible shame of your friends seeing you participate in it. 

In the coming weeks, we’re confident the numbers of gold farming accounts that plague popular training and resource areas will drop dramatically. We&#39;ve always taken a zero tolerance approach to botting and gold farming, and we&#39;re committed to delivering that for the Old School community too. If there are any botters reading then beware: it&#39;s not a matter of if you get caught, it&#39;s when you get caught. Don&#39;t put your account at risk and carelessly damage the integrity of the game. 

The community is coming.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You can spend $150 - $200 USD on the gold (which in Australia, as a professional, can be earned in a working day) OR you can get very very lucky after killing a monster OR you can grind out over 400 hours of gameplay doing something that’s worth at least 1 million gold per hour.<br>
To put that into perspective, 400 hours is over ten weeks of full time work at a job (in Australia, our full time work week is generally 38 hours).</p>

<p>NOTE: I’ve referred to ‘best armour’ as in the best armour available in EOC Runescape. This armour set is worth more than 400M. My point is still relevant in OSRS though, where there are surely very expensive items that take at least tens of hours of work to afford.[/quote]<br>

<p>i still cannot believe theres an argument on the perceived morality of botting on this forum. private servers were originally used to test bots, particularly aryan iirc. should i also mention that all significant groundwork done in the field of rsps was a by product of botting?</p>
<p>i’ve played rs since around 2003, and i will say that automation is the only way to have fun in the game.</p>
<p>PS: if bots were non-existent, i can guarantee many players would turn to RWT.</p>

              <p>The only legitimate way for anyone to be accurately accused of breaking a rule is if the accuser was there at the very scene to see the bot program running on the suspect’s computer screen. The same methodology would apply to real life situations, such as in court trials; some times the innocent get sentenced, either due to a fault in the system or an extreme coincidence in the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>Cheating is seen in real life, and even more drastically in games, so it is much harder to handle every happening. Even though Jagex says they have a bot detection system in play (like they have said for many years now), whether it be in the EoC or OSRS, I believe most of the ban decisions are based upon assumptions made by the system itself.</p>
<p>Also, in regards to everyone saying that cheating is either right or wrong, you are a hypocrite in stating so. It is highly unlikely for a human being to never have cheated before, no matter the severity or the cheat.</p>

<p>And regarding your “ps”, what? Did you even read what I said? You are such a moron, it hurts to read your post.[/quote]</p>
<p>You sound like me when I first joined… at the age of 12.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, you might feel accomplished, but in reality all you’ve done is spend hours to grind for something that you can easily buy in the market thanks to the bots. You make it sound like there would be a massive amount of raw materials in-game without bots, when in reality the amount of players who dedicate enough time to skill is almost negligible compared to the amount of bots that do all of that work for you.</p>
<p>Also, you stated that there <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> a right/wrong in the scenario. My point was that everyone is subject to opinion and thus botting can’t be right/wrong.</p>
<p>anyway, seeing as you’re the diehard christianity of this oh-so heated debate, i’ll let you feel accomplished and stop posting <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

I agree, just because it started as a cheating forum, doesn’t mean it is based around that when a majority of members joined.</p>
<p>Also, you can’t cheat on RS by using an RSPS because your progress on the RSPS doesn’t effect your RS account.</p>

ps we all have different opinions, no one is right and no one is wrong. don’t like bots? shut the love up. like bots? shut the love up.<br>
[/quote]Actually, clearly there is a right or wrong. Botting has showed how much the game can be ruined and if it was right, Jagex wouldn’t be fighting it so much. And plus it’s different to debate on an issue rather than an opinion. You’re treating this like it’s an argument over what band is better, but we’re actually <span class="bbcode-i">discussing</span> the effects of botting and whether it’s right or wrong. If you can’t tolerate it or contribute anything worthy of reading, then you shut the love up.[/quote]</p>
<p>my god you’re a little bitch lol</p>
<p>want my explanation for why botting is useful? if it weren’t for botting, there wouldn’t be an abundance of raw materials, and thus 99% of your time would be spent getting a magic shortbow because no one would be around to collect the logs and bowstring in massive amounts</p>
<p>oh and it’d be a huge barter economy because there would be almost no actual gp in the game</p>
<p>BUT WAIT LET ME GUESS! that makes the game perfect because THERE ARE NO BOTS</p>
<p>pls ok</p>
<p>ps: you are extremely close minded if you think there is a universal right/wrong to anything in life</p>

I’m really, really considering leaving this community. I hate it, all it contains are high ego maniacs who think they know everything. It’s really annoying. No wonder it’s so dead all the time.<br>
[/quote]<br>
i’m also considering leaving, and I have only been here five minutes![/quote]<br>
Well, no one is stopping you if you choose to leave.</p>
<p>I agree with ruby, it will only continue, they will find more ways to get around it because that’s what people do. They cheat.</p>
