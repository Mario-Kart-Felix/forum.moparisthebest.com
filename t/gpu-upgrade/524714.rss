    <title>GPU Upgrade</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gpu-upgrade/524714</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve posted in this board before asking a question similar to this one, and I actually received some great support, so I figured I would ask another question involving my GPU. I&#39;ve had my EVGA GTX 660ti for a few months now, and I&#39;ve certainly enjoyed the many gaming opportunities it has opened for me since it allowed me to set my integrated gpu as a thing of the past; however, there is always room and reasoning for upgrading, so I would like to do one of the following:

[ol][li]Get another 660ti and go SLI [b]OR[/b][/li]
	[li]Exchange my current card (plus the price difference) for a better card[/li][/ol]

I&#39;m not entirely sure what I would like to do at the moment, which is why I came here to ask this question. From what I&#39;ve heard, EVGA does allow you to trade in EVGA graphics cards for a higher tier card, while only requiring you to pay the difference between the two. I&#39;m not positive if this is true or not, but if it is, it will most certainly give me an easier opportunity to do a cheaper upgrade.


Which of the above two choices would you go with, and why? If you would go with choice 2, what GPU would you get?</description>

I’m just power hungry, really. Before I actually upgrade (I think I’m going to just get another 660ti), I will have to get a new motherboard that has more PCI slots and supports USB 3.0 (just so it will feel at home in my case), which is good, because my current motherboard is old. After that, I’m going to get an i7 processor so that I won’t experience any bottlenecking with the SLI setup.</p>
<p>Also, I’m a complete novice when it comes to building computers (although I’ve been catching on pretty quicky), but on average, how much would it cost to switch my system over to liquid cooling, and how hard would it be?</p>

<p>It’ll reach maybe 65 if I leave the fan on auto mode, but if I go manual and put it anything above 60% and it’ll stay under 50 easily.</p>
<p>So many factors though, there’s temperature of room, how much airflow, and which game.</p>
<p>For example I can play Bioshock Infinite absolutely maxed with no fps cap and the card never goes above 45 (even with auto fans!), and yet if I play Battlefield 3 it can dip into high 60s at times.</p>

Only one fan in the computer is a stock fan, and that is the CPU heatsink. All of the other fans came with the case and are CM fans. There is a spot to mount another fan that is near the video card, so I might get a stronger fan and mount it there.</p>

</aside>
<p>I know it is definitely a bigger case than my last one, but here the case is for reference:<br>
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119245" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119245</a></p>
<p>Also, I just spoke with a representative at EVGA, and they said that their Step-up program requires that you have purchased the card no more than 90 days ago, and sadly, I purchased my somewhere around 110 days ago. I was talking with my brother about giving him my 660ti once I upgraded, so I have a great idea actually:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Purchase another 660ti and go SLI[/li]<br>
[li]If I’m not satisfied with the performance before 90 days after purchase, use the Step-up program to upgrade to another card[/li]<br>
[li]Either sell my old 660ti (still covered by warranty) or give it to my brother[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I’m not really concerned about space inside the case (take a look at the link above), but I’m kind of concerned about the temperatures, since my current card idles at around 30[font=verdana][size=11px]°C.[/size][/font]</p>

              <p>Hardly?  New series are very good, my 680 never goes above 50°C (and my case is padded with noise foam as well, which generally means it runs hotter), certainly no where near the temperature needed to ‘burn up’ any hardware…<br>
As long as you don’t have a stupidly small case with no air flow whatsoever they’ll be fine.</p>
<p>I’m sure they wouldn’t make SLI with four/three cards possible if it was that much of a major issue.</p>

              <p>I’d just replace with the gtx 770. You can get it for like 400-500$ generally speaking. the 660ti is like 200-300$ so you are spending about 50% of the cost extra on a better card. You won’t see a <span class="bbcode-b">drastic</span> improvement but it would be better at least some.</p>

              <p>I’ve posted in this board before asking a question similar to this one, and I actually received some great support, so I figured I would ask another question involving my GPU. I’ve had my EVGA GTX 660ti for a few months now, and I’ve certainly enjoyed the many gaming opportunities it has opened for me since it allowed me to set my integrated gpu as a thing of the past; however, there is always room and reasoning for upgrading, so I would like to do one of the following:</p>
<p>[ol][li]Get another 660ti and go SLI <span class="bbcode-b">OR</span>[/li]<br>
[li]Exchange my current card (plus the price difference) for a better card[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure what I would like to do at the moment, which is why I came here to ask this question. From what I’ve heard, EVGA does allow you to trade in EVGA graphics cards for a higher tier card, while only requiring you to pay the difference between the two. I’m not positive if this is true or not, but if it is, it will most certainly give me an easier opportunity to do a cheaper upgrade.</p>
<p>Which of the above two choices would you go with, and why? If you would go with choice 2, what GPU would you get?</p>
