<p>Anyways, in my runescape days, I always preferred guild mining coal and occasionally selling Mithril or Steel bars. For me, that brought in a tidy sum, but runescape has changed since my days, and I would not be surprised if woodcutting or Pking had actually taken over. However, they all require some time building up the skill. Fishing is also a good way, but time consuming.</p>
