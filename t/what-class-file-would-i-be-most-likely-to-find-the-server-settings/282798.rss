    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-class-file-would-i-be-most-likely-to-find-the-server-settings/282798</link>
    <description>I got a hold of a few really old RSC bots and am trying to get them to work with current private servers.  here are the class files:

a
ba
bb
bc
bd
c
d
e
f
g
h
i
j
k
l
m
mudclient
n
o
p
q
r
s
t
u
v
w
x
y
z


Was just wondering if there would be a certain file that i would most likely find the settings?  And what it would look like exactly because ive done cntrl F and searched for port, server, connect.

I posted this is another part of the forums but i think this is a better spot.  I have already looked through the mudclient and m files.  however the mudclient file is over 500 pages of code.</description>

So don’t bother trying, also the IP/Port is usually located in the class that the mudclient extends.</p>
