    <description>Topic name.

I got a hold of a few really old RSC bots and am trying to get them to work with current private servers.  here are the class files:

a
ba
bb
bc
bd
c
d
e
f
g
h
i
j
k
l
m
mudclient
n
o
p
q
r
s
t
u
v
w
x
y
z


Was just wondering if there would be a certain file that i would most likely find the settings?  And what it would look like exactly because ive done cntrl F and searched for port, server, connect.</description>

              <p>yeah, i wasnt really sure where to post it as im not trying to make my own server.  but i did check both mudclient and m class files.  the mudclient file is 500+ pages of code if i was to print it off, and i didnt see anything resembling server settings in the m file.</p>

<p>anyways, I’m pretty sure it is mudclient or m, I don’t really know much about RSC.</p>
