              <p>[quote=“zyle1992, post:2, topic:322736”]That right there? That’s a child named Juan. He’s an orphan. CPS is currently investigating his case. His mother and father both died in a house fire. After the fire subsided, they saw that the bodies of his mother and father had been crushed by an air conditioner. Upon closer examination, the M.E. found that each of their esophagi had been slit, and there was a deadly poison injected into their veins. The cause of death? No one knows. Murder, accident? Coincidence, or conspiracy? You be the judge.[/quote]LOL</p>
