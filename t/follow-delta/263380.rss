hey guyz, recentily i had a problem,

when ever i barraged a player he coun&#39;t stop following me..

then i searched some site&#39;s and found this.
[code]if (MagicHandler.itFreezes){
			return;
		}[/code] 

some1 told me to add that under this.

[code]}
		if (isInAssault()){
			sM(&quot;You can&#39;t follow in assault!&quot;);
			return;[/code] 

so i did and &quot;yes&quot;this time barraged works perfect. But now when a player click to follow me he cant. well he can click follow but when i walk the player just stands there not follow:(

then i searched for more information and some1 said add this:
[code]if (entangleDelay &gt; 0)
{
return;
}
[/code]

under you attacking and following case but i cannot find the case :(

so can any1 plz tell me what is bes to use? this problem is annoying and if a barrage cannot freeze a player @ one place then its not good Playerkilling:(
