[size=18pt]The Problem[/size]
I have noticed that nearly everyone here uses Dropbox. Dropbox is good, I personally use it for synchronizing relatively important things between various machines, and it does a very good job. [i]It&#39;s made to be good[/i]. The job Dropbox is made for is synchronizing files between computers seamlessly, so you&#39;re always up to date on what you have. However, you don&#39;t need detailed information about a file&#39;s history and changes; the average user of Dropbox doesn&#39;t need a detailed backlog, and so Dropbox does not provide it. The average user will also rarely, if ever need to edit on two different machines simultaneously, so there&#39;s no real support for that either.

However! Programming is something that can go wrong very quickly, and a good way to fix things is to have a history. It&#39;s also very annoying if you&#39;re a programmer and two people working on one thing end up clashing and causing lots of errors. The manual solutions to these problems are:

[ul][li]Keep a backup of a working copy to revert or refer to if things go wrong[/li]
[li]Coordinate what people are working on through Skype or MSN[/li][/ul]

Both of these solutions will work, provided you&#39;re attentive and willing to coordinate lots of development precisely, but in all honesty, [b]wouldn&#39;t you just love it if this was all done for you?[/b]


[size=18pt]The Solution[/size]
Enter: [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control]Version Control Systems (VCS)[/url]. They do everything for you, such as keeping backups and storing development history and allowing multiple people to work on the same project seamlessly and easily. Imagine how much faster your programmers will be able to work if they&#39;re not constantly having to coordinate their work; they just write code and submit it. Also, a good VCS will prevent people from sabotaging your project and causing damage.

There are lots of different types of VCS, the commonest being [b]Subversion (SVN)[/b] (http://subversion.apache.org/) and [b]Git[/b] (http://git-scm.com/).

[size=18pt]VCS Plugins for IDEs[/size]
Most Java IDEs have support for version control systems provided as plugins or integrated into the IDE, which are a very useful and convenient way of developing and collaborating.

[size=18pt]Teams, Leaking and Sabotage[/size]
There are certain common problems that by purely using a VCS will not be solved, such as source leaking, which is a frustrating problem and a difficult one to counter. To prevent your source being leaked, it is highly recommended that you take care in selecting people to be on your team, perhaps quizzing them on why they want to be a part of your project. Unfortunately, there is no real way of preventing source leak, and occasionally you will get someone who wants to hinder the movement and productivity of your team by leaking or deleting source code. In the latter case, VCS software prevents source code being lost by keeping local copies of the source on your project member&#39;s computers, so deletion of the source should not be a large obstacle for your team to overcome since restoration is easy. You also have a lot of control over what source code is submitted to your projects so it&#39;s easy enough to avoid accepting the source with bits missing.


[size=18pt]Final Musings[/size]
Unlike Dropbox, learning to use a VCS will take longer. They are more complex, but a lot more flexible and much more reliable, and fortunately people have seen the need to help people with the complexity, hence why you&#39;ll find many tutorials about various VCS systems written for beginners.

Perhaps you may ask why your part-time 2-man project needs a VCS, truthfully it probably won&#39;t, but many projects are more than that, yet they still use technologies that are unfit for the task, and since I&#39;ve seen a few projects in this situation, I decided to create this to help out those who are having problems.</description>

<p>To combat the leaking problem you can simply test people who want to be apart of your team. By test I mean ask them how they would do ‘this or that’.

i’ll add more about teams and leaking when i have some spare time. thanks!</p>

if you want raw goddamn statistics in what i link to and what he links to, he links to 3 different sites. meanwhile, i link to 22 different sites and provide a plethora of information which he omitted despite talking about it (right click shell menus are characteristics of TortoiseSVN and TortoiseGit, which he didn’t link to or even mention). there is no bad vagueness in my thread from what i see (feel free to point it out) and no speculative bullshit about people passing a test to find candidates that won’t leak a source.</p>
<p>and this is a criticism of Dropbox as much as it’s an educative thread, which you seem to be overlooking.</p>
