    <title>&quot;unexpected response from server&quot; shown in client for others but not me</title>

    <description>Hey, 

I&#39;m making a server and was going to do my first beta run of all the features I currently have. 
When my friend tried to login, he got &quot;unexpected reponse from server&quot; however when I use exactly the same client as him it works fine.

There are also no errors. Any suggestions? The version is 550 and I&#39;m using scapeemulator base. 
Thanks</description>
