    <title>Legendscape breakthrough! remote server activation via messenger!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/legendscape-breakthrough-remote-server-activation-via-messenger/106496</link>
    <description>I am without a doubt proud to say that we have finally finished a project worthy of recognition! The FAPSB other wise known as the FULLY AUTOMATED PRIVATE SERVER BOT is now in operations this bot is the solution to downed servers! This is making legendscape&#39;s server unbeatable! why? because if our server crashes or if we are not on or are away and our server is not up there is no more waiting! you just add this bot and ask it to turn the server on! that easy and once you ask him he will tell you the progress and status of the server! Using .brs files we have made the coolest auto server restarter with a fail safe we swear when used and set correctly it will do its job without fail. now my typing is off yes because i am excited. Now I will release information on how to create this scripts but they will have to be gotten through me untill i realese them here.

This bot is online as we speak undergoing major tests
bot-0000000001@hotmail.com

This bot is using GCB scripting with GMS scripts to work.

My E-mail is jarrett25@msn.com I can make you one no problem.

This is in the development because this is in my opinion development. The wait for servers to be online is now over.</description>

              <p>funny? Do you even know what gcb and gms scripts belong too without looking it up. come on. you laugh at people who have new ideas and new ways of thinking try being supportive and helping others. We are all here because we have things in common wether it be our love of java scripting or runescape private servers or maybe it is for another reason. But please If anyone has any ideas on improvements please tell me. Knowledge is usless if it is not shared.</p>
