    <title>Client -Packet Error Help</title>

    <description>Hi 
everytime i try going on my server with bluurs client, it logs in with a black screen for one second and then it d&#39;cs you out. The same thing happens when i repeat it.
This is the error i get [code]Error: Packet lost type 2 refreshing connection[/code].
When i go on my mates server; with bluurs client it&#39;s all fine ; it&#39;s like any other ordinary client....
But i CAN ONLY go on my mates server with BLUURS client. If you use a different client your acc will seem like its glitched/nulled
Whereas on my server you can go on any client and it&#39;s just normal EXCEPT BLUURS client
As i said above it just logs in with a black screen for about one second then d&#39;cs you out

Note; me and my mates have same source which is ddspeced source

Can you tell how to fix this please thanks.</description>
