    <description>Starting a new RSPS, last one we created was 2 years ago and was #2 on Mopar for a very long time, over 300 Online on a daily basis.

Hoping to get it started again.

We need:

Programmers- This includes; Java, VB, being able to work with Dropbox / KVM / Remote access - For connecting to the Dedicated ports.
Economic Advisers- This includes; Helping us with the economics part of things, pricing on items, editing them daily, changing stocks and many other things.

Please contact us on Moparscape or on Skype if you&#39;re interested.
