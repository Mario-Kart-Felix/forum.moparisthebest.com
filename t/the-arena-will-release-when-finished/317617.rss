    <title>The Arena. - Will Release When Finished</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-arena-will-release-when-finished/317617</link>
    <description>[b]WHATS THE PLAN?[/b]

Basically just thought of an amazing idea for a server that im going to get to work on right away. Your a prisoner who has been captured and you are &quot;forced&quot; to fight npc&#39;s and players in two seperate arenas, the NPC arena and the PVP arena. 

The NPC arena will be the only way to train and there will be a series of teleports that teleport you onto the next stage of npc&#39;s (gaining levels until the final boss)

The PVP arena will reward players with points that they will be able to buy especially PVP gear with.

The shops will also only allow you to trade them if you have a certain NPC point amount.. EG the starter gear guy sells full iron for you to kill goblins, while the second guy gives you dragon and soforth.

There will also be an NPC point shop that you will be able to buy showoff gear with (eg partyhats) but there will also be combat items included.

This will provide interest for both NVP players and PVP players, and force all players to try out both sides, as they have to train and they have to get good weapons from the pvp point shop.

The home will have to be some kind of a place that loos like a prison with lots of room and areas for stalls..
(Thinking of making randoms on stalls so you get a certain item dependant on random)

As i said before ill get started now and post pics ASAP.

[b]WHAT IVE DONE SO FAR:[/b]

[code]
Found a home
added requirements and money to the stalls

Added some globalobjects
Added perfect range + melle follow
[/code]

Looks good actualy but if the home is wilderniss new players get attacked right?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>the home isnt actually wilderness… ive changed that but cba to update pics :O[/quote]<br>
The range following isn’t the perfect one because if the player don’t stop running it won’t follow it try it out.</p>

Your pictures suck hard, this idea is gay. I don’t think anyone would want to play this when they can just PK.<br>

<p>They suck hard because anyone can do anything that you did in your pictures. If you just make servers for fun, then why do you release?</p>

<p>Here we go again. An easy server to make, and of course, with a delta. I don’t think you’re able to do any better.</p>

<p>Im not sure its delta actually… the combat system is waaaayyy different and there isnt wilderness ;).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s delta. That’s the only thing you work with because you can’t do anything better. You say on every server 'perfacttttt dds spac!!!" when you edited a timer once and then did it on your next server, so it’s nothing knew. All you do is follow tutorials. Your ‘arena points’ are gay because all you do is edit a pk points method. All you are doing is making wilderness and adding points. <span class="bbcode-b">Wow, a pk server based around an arena.</span></p>
