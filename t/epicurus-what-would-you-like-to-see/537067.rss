    <title>Epicurus - What would you like to see?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/epicurus-what-would-you-like-to-see/537067</link>
    <description>After much thinking, JaydenD12 and I have decided to relaunch Epicurus with the help off Ruby. We&#39;d like to ask the community what you&#39;d like to see, so please reply here with your answers.

We&#39;re working off Jayden&#39;s release, Epicurus&#39; released source and client. If you have any other questions or queries please post below.

One more major thing I&#39;d like to note, we&#39;re only running one world, with both economy and pking.

I&#39;d just like to note, that considering Jayden&#39;s name and my name are the same, I decided to use my middle name on the forums/server which is Kieran.

Thanks,
Epicurus Team.</description>

              <p>I’m fine with such an idea seeing as you want to give some form or another of an aesthetic compensation for donating. But why offer items such as what you mentioned? To me, that says that if you have the money, why participate in uncommon game events when I can just buy those items? Perhaps offer robes, unique (customized) fun items that have options to “whack” others. That’s just my two cents, though.</p>

              <p>I’ll let the server sided developers reply to your post, marc.</p>
<p>Just going to give everyone an overview of the donation system that will be employed. No item that is bought from the donation store can be sold or give in-game boosts. All items are merely for aesthetics. My idea to do this was to have 2 different models for each the donation item and the in-game item. For example: we hit 300 players online, we decide to do a small drop party to get some of the rare items into the economy that can’t be gotten from drops such as party hats. These can be traded and sold. However, the party hat that you donate for cannot be traded or sold because of the different model, it looks the exact same but because of the different ID’s one can be exempt from trades. This way donating does not effect the economy in the slightest, it instead actually boosts the staffs input into doing some form of events every now and again.</p>
<p>Once again: The items that can be donated for will only be aesthetic. No torva, weapons etc. Party hats, some pieces of clothing, santa hats, halloween masks and that general type of thing.</p>
<p>Anyone have any objections to that?</p>

              <p>After much thinking, JaydenD12 and I have decided to relaunch Epicurus with the help off Ruby. We’d like to ask the community what you’d like to see, so please reply here with your answers.</p>
<p>We’re working off Jayden’s release, Epicurus’ released source and client. If you have any other questions or queries please post below.</p>
<p>One more major thing I’d like to note, we’re only running one world, with both economy and pking.</p>
<p>I’d just like to note, that considering Jayden’s name and my name are the same, I decided to use my middle name on the forums/server which is Kieran.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Epicurus Team.</p>
