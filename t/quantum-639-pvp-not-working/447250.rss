    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quantum-639-pvp-not-working/447250</link>
    <description>so my quantum 639 source has pvp when i first downloaded it but today when i tried pking i could&#39;nt attack anybody
like the attack option was missing there was only follow and trade 

i checked the actionsenders and option handlers and they were nearly as the same as the original
could any1 tell me which .java file the right clikc option for pvp is stored?

thx
