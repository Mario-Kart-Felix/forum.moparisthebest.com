    <description>sorry to bother you about this.. but my webclient gives me the  1 2 3 4 5 error..

the client is on webgamingwebsite.com


the cache is on webgamingwebsite.com/cache.zip

this is from my client.java


&lt;blockquote&gt;downloadcache(&quot;http://webgamingwebsite.com/cache.zip&quot;, &quot;cache.zip&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;cache&quot;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;;

signlink


&lt;blockquote&gt;               String s = &quot;C:/.sexyscape_file_store_32/&quot;;
                String s1 = &quot;&quot;;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
when i replaced it the s and s1 were something else witch were longer.. that could be the problem...

also when my client downloads cache i do 2 the sexyscape file store on disk c: and theres only the cache folder... its not extracted.. that could also be the problem..</description>
