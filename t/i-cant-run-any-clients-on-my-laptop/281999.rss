    <title>*@*@* I Can&#39;t Run Any Clients On My Laptop?! *@*@*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-run-any-clients-on-my-laptop/281999</link>
    <description>Hey all!

I have just went and bought a new laptop last week and
I just have been tyring to download a server to play on.
I can download it and all just fine, but when I go to click
on Run.bat, the black CMD box pops up for like 0.03 secs!
I can&#39;t see what it says and I don&#39;t have time to take a
screenshot or nothing. So if anyone has any ideas on how 
to resolve this, that would be great!

[b]Also:[/b] I have a desktop computer too in my room and
I can download and play servers on that so I don&#39;t know what
is so different about my laptop not being able to run anything.

[b]Extra Info (In-Case):[/b] 1.25 GB of RAM - Windows Vista Ultimate.

Thanks in advance!
