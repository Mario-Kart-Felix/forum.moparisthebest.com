    <title>The Chick-fil-A Dispute</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-chick-fil-a-dispute/452801</link>
    <description>For those of you who don&#39;t know people are absolutely freaking out because Chick-fil-A has been donating millions to an anti-samesex marriage campaign. I personally believe that if people have such a big problem with this, then they&#39;re pretty damn hypacritical because if you argue that they shouldn&#39;t support the campaign because &quot;The gays should have rights to there own beliefs&quot;, yet you don&#39;t give Chick-fil-A a right to theres, then your just as bad as they are.

Also I don&#39;t really care about gay marriage because it&#39;s not like 2 men getting married is going to make life on earth stop.

Opinions?</description>

<p>“They” meaning the Mayors. The mayors wanted a ban on chick fil a because of Cathy’s statement. Not because they have been donating to anti-gay marriage programs.</p>

What is the primary goal of Salvation Army, charity or banning Gay Marriage? I would consider them a charity as I don’t see them as an anti-gay organisation.</p>
<p>In the same way I don’t consider the Catholic Church as an anti-condom organization. Their focus isn’t on banning condoms, it just one of their many views.</p>
<p>While I think no organization that discriminate against people should get tax reduction or government money, and no organization should be able to lobby. Salvation Army isn’t the big problem.</p>

It isn’t intolerance to fight against intolerance. You must also remember that politicians are playing a game, make people vote for you.</p>

<p>A scandal isn’t a scandal until it’s been exposed and that can’t happen until the media blow it out of proportion, usually to the effect of blocking all other news out. Speaking of which, did anyone notice that Obama signed the patriot act extentio–HEY GUYS CHIK-FIL-A CONTROVERSY</p>

<p>What I meant to say was, anti-gay charities and organizations. They may not fit the strict definition of a charity, but Chik-fil-a has donated to several tax-exempt non-profit organizations which may fit the legal definition of a charity. The fault is mine, I usually consider any non-profit organization to be a charity, part of my nomenclature I guess.</p>

<p>Niall, they have ALWAYS been donating to anti-gay programs. The fire only started when he was ASKED about gay marriage and everyone was shocked at the answer.</p>

<p>I was looking up the definition and they are clearly not charities. The definition according to Oxford Dictionary is:</p>
<ol>
<li>An organization set up to provide help and raise money for those in need.</li>
<li>The voluntary giving of help, typically in the form of money, to those</li>
<li>Kindness and tolerance in judging others.</li>

<p>Where is the charity in lobbying for intolerance?</p>

              <p>For those of you who don’t know people are absolutely freaking out because Chick-fil-A has been donating millions to an anti-samesex marriage campaign. I personally believe that if people have such a big problem with this, then they’re pretty damn hypacritical because if you argue that they shouldn’t support the campaign because “The gays should have rights to there own beliefs”, yet you don’t give Chick-fil-A a right to theres, then your just as bad as they are.</p>
<p>Also I don’t really care about gay marriage because it’s not like 2 men getting married is going to make life on earth stop.</p>
<p>Opinions?</p>
