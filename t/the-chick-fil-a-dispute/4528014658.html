<p>No, I didn’t know that they were donating to anti-gay marriage programs but if I was asked if they were against gay marriage, I would use my common sense and say yes.</p>

        <p>“What would you say about the Salvation Army though? They match the definition of a charity but seek to discriminate against homosexuals.”<br>
What is the primary goal of Salvation Army, charity or banning Gay Marriage? I would consider them a charity as I don’t see them as an anti-gay organisation.</p>
<p>In the same way I don’t consider the Catholic Church as an anti-condom organization. Their focus isn’t on banning condoms, it just one of their many views.</p>
<p>While I think no organization that discriminate against people should get tax reduction or government money, and no organization should be able to lobby. Salvation Army isn’t the big problem.</p>
<p>Milkman:<br>
It isn’t intolerance to fight against intolerance. You must also remember that politicians are playing a game, make people vote for you.</p>
