FAQ AND RULES TO POST HERE

Can we post our server link just to tell you...
NO! Your server IP does not matter here if you post it you will be reported AND I will not help you

No body can connect to my server!!!!!
You did not portforward correctly as of now I am not taking any portforward questions please go here
www.portforward.com 

Keeps saying I need java but I have like 5!
Uninstall all previous versions then change it on your compiler as said below.

Can we PM you or message you on MSN for help
NO! I am getting sick and tired of it so do not... Theres over 100 people on my friends list for people that just added me... SO STOP!

USEFUL LINKS

http://no-ip.com/

http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

http://winrar.d0wnloadz.net/

http://silabsoft.org/smf/index.php?showtopic=1911 - Zykev2&#39;s Ultimate tutorial list



\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\





Step 1: Getting JDK

First go to this link

http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

Then select the FIRST version \&#39;online\&#39;. And basically thats it once it is downloaded you now have JDK. Its really as simple as that no need to explain further.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Step 2: GETTING A NO-IP

This is probably the easiest part of making a server. How you do this is go to

www.no-ip.com

once you are there sign up and log in and under HOST/ REDIRECTS click \&#39;ADD\&#39;

and fill it in like this



Where it says SERVERNAME thats what you need to fill in. so it would be for example

Testingscape

then on the drop down box select your hostname lets say we want it to be .no-ip.biz 

so we would select no-ip


Testingscape.no-ip.biz

now DONT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE click add host. and thats it. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3:DOWNLOADING NO-IP

Great now after selecting your hostname on the no-ip.com go to \&#39;DOWNLOADS\&#39; and you should pop up to a screen similar to this




Click that and you should pop up to a screen like this



Click download.

Now once it is downloaded sign in with your username and password for no-ip if it did not auto sign in. You can do this by on the no-ip screen the little one click \&#39;EDIT\&#39; then sign in and your IP\&#39;s should pop up like this



Check mark the place before the IP you want to use.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Step 4: Getting a server source (base)


Go to silabsoft homepage (Silabsoft.org/smf) and go to the downloads section.


Now for the sake of example I am going to pick my server source. (Cryptchaos) You can choose it or anyone you want. Figmentscape is a good source also.



Find the download link if your using Cryptchaos it will be at the very bottom of the 1st topic.



Once you downloaded ANY source it should be in .zip or .rar format, You should have winRAR now it should pop up to a screen like this



Click the extract button and extract it to desktop



Now it should pop up to a regular folder on your desktop. Open your folder.

Server: Cryptchaos.no-ip.biz



 Step 5: Getting rid of the &#39;Cannot find specified path error&#39;


Once you have your source folder open try to click the &#39;run&#39; or &#39;runserver&#39; or whatever it says and if it says something like cannot find specifed path or a java website pops up go back to your &#39;run&#39; file and...

Right click &gt; Edit &gt; and paste this code


CODE
@echo off  title YOUR SERVER COMPILERcolor 0a&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_0#\bin\java.exe&quot; -cp .;.jar server pause 

Where it says &#39;0#&#39; the # is your java version we downloaded &#39;JDk6u7&#39; so you would fill in 7 if that does not work try 6.

Now if that still does not work then we need to get your computer to read it. Go to

My computer

Under System Tasks

View system information

System properties should pop up go to 

Advanced

then

Environmental Variables

User variables 

Click &#39;NEW&#39; and name it CLASSPATH

paste this code into it


CODE
CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_0#\bin;%CLASSPATH%;

Again replace the # with the version of java you have.

Again under &#39;user variables&#39; name it PATH

And paste this code in


CODE
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_0#\bin

Again replace the # with your version of java.

Click ok on both screens.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: Portforwarding and Opening the default port &#39;43594&#39;

Go to 

start &gt; all programs &gt; accessories &gt; command prompt

and Type &#39;IP config&#39;



Once you press &#39;enter&#39; you should see something like this



You want your &#39;Default gateway&#39; and your &#39;IP address&#39; 

Go to your browser and click put your default gateway in. I have a netgear so its 192.168.1.1 and Lynksys is the same to I believe. 

It will come up to a password screen



Enter your username and password for your router.

This is a short list of passwords and usernames by default


USERNAME: admin
PASSWORD: admin

USERNAME: admin
PASSWORD: password

USERNAME: 
password: admin

USERNAME: admin
PASSWORD: 

once you are logged in if your using netgear it should look similar to this. If you are not you need to find your portforward page by yourself or use

Portforward.com



Now assuming you have netgear router click portforward / porttriggering

(This was taken after I filled it out use your imagination and cancel out the one there)


it should pop up to a screen Click &#39;ADD CUSTOM SERVICE&#39; and fill it out similar to this



It really does not matter what name you put Ive portforwarded with names like

RSPS
Moparscape
Silab
Silabsoft

--------------
FOR OTHER USERS THIS IS HOW YOU WOULD FILL IT IN TO JUST DIFFERENT FORM&#39;
--------------

Congratulations you portforwarded now go to your firewall 

Start &gt; Control panel &gt; Firewall &gt; exceptions
