    <title>Need Help with Opening/Running Server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-opening-running-server/116117</link>
    <description>Well, i&#39;ve been working with my server for a few days, and wanna have some of my friends test it out.  Yes, i know how to compile/run the server, and how to open moparscape   :D.  I&#39;ve also made a no-ip ID.  ok, so i log into MoparScape as Twisted Fun with my own pass, and make the IP &quot;localhost&quot;.  the actual IP is &quot;abc123scape1.no-ip.org&quot;, but &quot;localhost&quot; should work too.

so i log in, tell my friend to login with any username, any pass, and &quot;abc123scape1.no-ip.org&quot; as the IP.  and it didn&#39;t work.  i probably missed somethin somewhere, cause i cant get it to work with other computers!

anybody, help plz!

thanks!
