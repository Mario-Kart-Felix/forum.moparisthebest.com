        <p>WARNING YOU NEED A SENSE OF HUMOUR TO READ THESE ARTICLES!!!</p>
<p>Everyone knows wikipedia the encyclopedia. Well this is a take off of wikipedia and its called the uncyclopedia. There are some funny articles. Here are some i’ve read.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Runescape</span><br>
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Runescape" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Runescape</a></p>
<blockquote>RuneScape is an MMORPGGY comparable to other crappy games such as Guild Wars, Everquest and Final Fantasy XI. There are currently over two million accounts, with about sixty of those being active. RuneScape acts as a substitute for social interaction for the nerds and nine year olds who play it.</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">WoW</span><br>
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/World_of_warcraft" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/World_of_warcraft</a></p>
<blockquote>World of Warcraft is a famous parody on the game World of Whorecraft made by Blizzard Entertainment. It's newest version is an MMORPGOMGLOLWTFBBQ, or more simply an MMORPG, which is what most modern games are. It is based in the fictitious world of Azeroth, a warring land. Hence, the name. In the game, you choose your side, race, and start at level 1. From this point, you go through the World of Warcraft doing quests, killing things, and gaining Experience to grow in level and skill, While slowly losing a part of your soul until the rumored level 80, at which you become a souless fiend bent on world destruction. Currently, the amount of suscribers to the game is approximately the population of New Guinea.</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Microsoft</span><br>
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Microsoft</a></p>
<blockquote>Microsoft (comes from the German words "micro schaft", meaning "small penis", and, quite appropriately, was coined by Bill Gates' first wife on their wedding night), a now defunct software company, was a victim to rampant software piracy. Because many people used Microsoft Windows without paying a dime, Microsoft eventually had to close its doors, while Apple and several companies involved with the implementation and support of Linux made a huge profit. The name "Microsoft" is fondly remembered as the smallest unit of software functionality, and references to the company outside of history books, hype from Wired magazine, or hacker humour have nearly gone extinct. Of course, history will fondly remember Microsoft as the loser in the War on microsoft.</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Windows</span><br>
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Windows" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Windows</a></p>
<blockquote>“Keyboard not detected. Press any key to continue.”
<pre><code>~ Microsoft Windows on Paradoxical Errors 
</code></pre>
<p>Microsoft Windows is the collective name for a series of operating systemz(viruses) that began development in 1983, originally as a means of reversing the stagnation of the computer hardware market. Windows crashes regularly because it’s popular and it likes to eat fish for brunch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Bill Gates</span><br>
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Bill_gates" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Bill_gates</a></p>
<blockquote>Sir William Henry Joseph Roger Garfield Thelonius Remington Gates III (Born October 31, 1955 B.C.) is the founder, chairman, chief software architect, and supreme dark lord of Microsoft, the world's largest corporation, true creator of iPod, owner of the One Ring of Power, and the worst arch-villain in the whole human history, surpassing Lex Luthor, Larry King, Gary Busey, and even the nefarious but somehow still charming Oprah Winfrey. Actually, that last part's a lie. No one's worse than Oprah at anything.</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Macintosh</span><br>
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Macintosh" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Macintosh</a></p>
<blockquote>A Macintosh is a rare electric appliance and the object of devoted worship for followers of a mostly harmless cult, led by the Dark Lord, Steve Jobs, most of whom profess it to be some sort of computer. Up to now, there still is doubt about whether Steve Jobs, or The Tupolev Brothers invented the Macintosh. But unlike the better known and more popular Personal Computer, or PC, as its called, earlier models of Macintosh's were incapable of running the astoundingly less reliable Microsoft Windows operating system which remains dominate throughout the computer industry, and thus must obviously be a better choice. Macintosh computers, or "Macs", as they are usually called, are built and sold by a group of new-age hippie types that were forced by their lawyers to form a corporation which they named "Apple," mostly cause they all really wanted to join the Beatles, and thought if they named their company after the British recording company of the same name, they could fool the groopie rejects discarded by Paul, John, George, and Ringo that they were part of the band, and thus finally "get some" and at long, long last, finally lose their virginity.</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">America</span><br>
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/United_States_Of_America" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/United_States_Of_America</a></p>
<blockquote>United States of America = Satane Dictatore, Fuse Mei! A latin sentence which means: Satan dictator, fuse with me!, is an experiment by God to develop a prototype for his next planetary creation. The budget was considerably lower than the first one, allowing for only 3 days to create it, so was likely to contain a mass of things God had already created. The prototype will, in theory, provide an insight into what happens when a naked land is populated by other nationalities and was easily and rapidly filled by hopeful degenerates whos own country was sickened by them.</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Mcdonalds</span><br>
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Mcdonalds" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Mcdonalds</a></p>
<blockquote>The McDonald's is an international temple-chain where worshippers put sandwiches made of "meat" and "bread" to the altar and let the robed priests disassemble these foods and put their components into a refrigerator. Only by returning foods to their original state can they satisfy Ronald McDonald, the God who created the franchise. McDonald's (aka Muck Donald's) currently kills 100 people a day, due to its food and the ingredients they put in it, yet people are stupid enough to believe that they can sue them for persuading them to eat there! Experts agree that it's the 10th highest cause of death in North America Today.</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Internet Explorer</span><br>
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer</a></p>
<blockquote>“In Soviet Russia, Internet exploits You!”
<pre><code>~ Russian Reversal on Internet Exploiter 
</code></pre>
<p>Internet Explorer, also known as Internut Exploder (and not to be confused with the less successful Inuit Explorer) is a small and very unhandy tool coming with Microsoft Linspire “can i suck your dick”, that can be used to visit warez and pr0n sites and download spyware, which are microorganisms which live in symbiosis with it. Internet Explorer is not to be confused with Netscape or Firefox or Ninjas that were all popular forms of pr0n veiwing before the third coming of the Flying Spagetti Monster which wiped out all companies in the world to be replaced with roving bands of pirates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Australia</span><br>
<a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Australia" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Australia</a></p>
<blockquote>Australia was formerly theorised to be the largest island in the world, but was later discovered to be nothing more than a hilariously undersized continent. Though Australia was first colonised by the Aborigines circa 60,000 B.C., the British took control of it after a bizarre administrative error which also created North Korea, Poland and Sweden. It was then discarded by the then King of England, King Kong, who was often criticised for having a typically 2D view of the world. Fortunately for England he was ousted from Primate Ministership by a strategically placed barrel to the head.</blockquote>[br][size=1]Posted on: January 15, 2007, 05:48:21 PM[/size][hr]Edit: Added some more.
