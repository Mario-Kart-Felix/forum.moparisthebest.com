    <description>About 80% of servers are project insanity..... Is it even worth using anymore? I mean anything unique in a PI is already taken by other servers, to me it&#39;s just not worth it anymore. I don&#39;t even play PI&#39;s anymore because they are getting so ridicilous... What do u think:o</description>

<p>Agreed, for the most part.</p>
<p>All i’m trying to say is, the members of this community want something that’s already ‘completed’. You have PI in one hand, and Hyperion in another. Which one do you think an ‘average’ member of the community would pick?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I get what your saying, but that still doesn’t prove that PI is easier, it may be easier to find tutorials that will either create more problems or break the entire server. But that still doesn’t change the fact that a server such as Hyperion or Apollo will still be easier to create content for. Anyone can convert pi content to Apollo or Hyperion, no one does because they would rather buy a $700 dollar dedicated server that will run PI, when they could create good content on Apollo or Hyperion have have a 200-300 dollar dedicated server or even less![/quote]<br>
Add an object action to a PI and you just dump it in a piece of code, add an object action to runesource and you already have to start switching classes and add code in different places (at least if you want to follow the design).<br>
I developed on a runesource base and once you get used to the base it’s as easy as any other. But taking the time for that is something most people wont do. There are a bunch of tutorials and there’s already a bunch of content included (PI’s) so why would they go for hyperion, runesource, apollo, ect.<br>
The only people that will do this are the ones that are actually wanting to learn how a server is build and want to get good at it.<br>
Also an obstacle is that you have to do it alone, you wont get much help from a tutorial or the help section if you use such a base since most people just don’t know anything about it. And as a starter you wont get anywhere without some help. And who are the people who help in the help section? Also noobs</p>
<p>edit:<br>
What also has changed is the mentality.<br>
Many of us where kids playing in the good old days, we aim for quality and gameplay fun.<br>
More and more of use are leaving the scene due getting to old and the young ones joining are kids grown up in a world of graphics and wealth.</p>

<p>That was the entire reason why I put (easier) in quotes. The developers don’t take their time with projects, they want that $$$. With that being said, they can’t be bothered to convert code.</p>

<p>RuneSource isn’t easy to work with? RuneSource its self is based off of the WinterLove design the same design as PI. The rest of the servers are easy to work with, just because they use better naming doesn’t mean that they’re in fact harder to program. Last I checked Java in PI, is the same Java in Hyperion and Apollo.</p>

<p>The server is run on a very powerful dedicated server, I am taking a large amount of RAM, a very powerful CPU, and then on top of that a high bandwidth line.

<p>That or it could show that it is a well designed server.  You don’t have access to their code, so we’ll probably never know, but it’s unfair to say “well, since it was pi it must be shit” when we have no perception of anything they’ve done with the server.[/quote]</p>
<p>No, not at all. I am not saying it’s shit because its PI based. I am saying it’s shit because they have to use such a high spec dedicated server to run it.</p>
