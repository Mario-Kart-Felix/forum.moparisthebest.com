    <title>One down, six billion to go</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/one-down-six-billion-to-go/183417</link>
    <description>[size=8pt]You&#39;re ensconced in clear night skies, grinning at me like the Cheshire cat as my eyes dance around the stars.

I never could find the brightest in the sky until I looked in your eyes,

Dazzling the crowd enough to get an encore.

They dress your ego in indulgence.  Hedonism caresses your curves and lingers just long enough to express your expressions without a glance at your face.

Never so long have I had my head down, but your grace keeps my eyes glued to my feet, and as much as I like my shoes there&#39;s just something about you and it keeps me on edge.

Sweet talk means nothing from lips as experienced as yours, but though your words are bitter I crave a taste and so I place my hand on your waist.

To get your attention I need the charisma to speak so I whisper the truth; 

&quot;Now listen to me, I&#39;m speechless at the sight of you&quot;

[This isn&#39;t the end, I&#39;m sure there is an aftermath but in reality it&#39;s not happened yet so I&#39;m stuck.]

Thanks, my friend likes that line too ^^<br>
Yes I did write it all myself. I do alot of writing.<br>
This, my friend, Is how a young girl conveys her feelings… just from a male point of view <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Most things I write have a sort of lustful feeling about them…<br>
As weird as that sounds.</p>
