    <description>well first of all i spawned some guards, and i put there npcdrops in the .cfg file like this :

npcdrop = 9   995   12   75   //guard drop/coins/12 of it/75% chance drop.
npcdrop = 9   2530   1   100   //guard drop/bones/1 of it/100% chance drop.


and yes i am tabing, but for some reason the npcs are not dropping what i put, they drop nothing at all. please help me. k0 gawd k0. and yes i got a npcdrops.java also.

and i do compile and run also. :S

i have posted this earlier but i dont understand what the person said, this is what he/she said :

you have to go into the item2.jave through item4.java,  then search the npc name, or code. The npcdrop.cfg doesnt work for all servers/sources.
Hope i could help =)

what exactly do i search for? i typed npc name and there code but i dont understand please help.</description>
