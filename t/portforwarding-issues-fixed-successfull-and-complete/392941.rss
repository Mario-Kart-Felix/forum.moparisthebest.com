    <title>Portforwarding Issues! FIXED! Successfull and Complete!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-issues-fixed-successfull-and-complete/392941</link>
    <description>I have been trying to portforward for about 5 hours now. Could someone let me know if I&#39;m missing anything as I believe I&#39;ve done quite literally everything possible 3 or 4 times over. My operating system is Windows 7.

-I have disabled my Norton anti-virus.
-I have made TCP and UDP, inbound and outbound, exceptions for the port 43594 via Windows 7 Firewall.
-I have made inbound and outbound exceptions for the program NO-IP DUC 3.0 via Windows 7 Firewall.
-I have accessed my router. It is a 2Wire 2701HG-B  
-I created a new port exception via the router for port 43594, TCP and UDP.
-I added the port exception to the relative field in my router.
-I downloaded uTorrent. Ran my server first. Had NO-IP running... CTRL + P... Made an exception for port 43594, only having the Windows Firewall and Enable NAT-PMP port mapping boxes checked. It made an exception in my Firewall.
-I disabled my Firewall competely.


After every step, I checked http://www.canyouseeme.org and it always said connection refused or connection timed out.

Am I missing something vital out?</description>

              <p>yeah, the connection keeps getting timed out. Um one the portforwarding port checker, They are able to ping off my router and so on but Im able to recieve packets they send my way. I have followed th onnline tutorial on portforwarding for my router and also set up a static ip through the tutorial. I continue to get the same thing. I have also tried using uTorrent. I checked my firewall and uTorrent has created its spot to go through my Firewall. I am so confused and if anyone knows anything about Windows 7 Portforwarding along with the 2Wire 2701HG-B Router… Im becoming frustrated…</p>
