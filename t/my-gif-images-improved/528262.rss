    <title>My GIF images [IMPROVED]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-gif-images-improved/528262</link>
    <description>Well, uhmm, This is my first time making .GIF formatted images, I used Photoshop CS5 extended, I&#39;ve just done a simple design, and I haven&#39;t included a background. I will do that on my second try. Constructive criticism, Thanks. Supportive comments that help me improve is encouraged.

<p>V2 is much too choppy with the fade effect. The increments you changed the opacity by was too high. Try just changing them both by 10% everytime next time. This will give you a much smoother effect</p>

              <p>There isn’t much to criticize because it’s the most basic gif you could do. There is nothing that has to be smooth, or timed out or anything.</p>

              <p>Well, uhmm, This is my first time making .GIF formatted images, I used Photoshop CS5 extended, I’ve just done a simple design, and I haven’t included a background. I will do that on my second try. Constructive criticism, Thanks. Supportive comments that help me improve is encouraged.</p>
