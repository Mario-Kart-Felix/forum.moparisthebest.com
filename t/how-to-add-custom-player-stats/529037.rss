    <title>How to add custom player stats?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-custom-player-stats/529037</link>
    <description>Server: Rune-Evo
Clinet: Matrix 718 

For instance I want to add a point system for pvp kills (possibly later implement boss kills but for now stick to pvp) and eventually a reward system.
But i want to stick to the basics right now.

I&#39;m using eclipse and in com.rs.game.player.content.custom I have a class file called PvpPoints.

How would I go about saving individual stats for each person and then upon killing another player increment said points. I don&#39;t see any classes for player combat.

P.S.
I know Java, I just don&#39;t know where the classes are that handles combat / how to add custom points to the server.


EDIT:
I assume I have to add the points as a private variable in the player class and have a getter and setter for it (which I have done) for starters.</description>
