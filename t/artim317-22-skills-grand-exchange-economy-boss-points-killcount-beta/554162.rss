Introduction:[/b]

[spoiler][b]We want to make it clear to everyone that this is beta and not an official release, 
we have been working very hard on this project and are willing to continue with your help, the players, to develop the most finest gameplay. 
That is why we&#39;re starting with a Beta release, to create this in the most efficent way and work on what has to be worked on and build up unique features. 
There are most likely several bugs &amp; suggestions that can improve the gameplay.
