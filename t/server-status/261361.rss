    <description>Has anyone else had problems posting their server under the mopar server status page?

I&#39;ve done this plenty of times before but for some reason it doesn&#39;t seem to be working anymore

It says I&#39;ve successfully posted the server and then when the list updates every 30 minutes it doesn&#39;t show up and it lets me post it again so I know it was removed or not accepted onto the list. 

I know my server is online because people have logged on while this problem has been happening. 

Does anyone know what&#39;s wrong?</description>
