    <description>I don&#39;t know if this was on purpose, but I saw a bunch of people doing the formsize(big name) on server status, I tried it then later on made a post to delete my server, I came home today to find out on this IP it says It&#39;s already posted(Which it isn&#39;t) and on a different IP it says &quot;Already posted or Banned, please check again&quot;, I know alot of other people that haven&#39;t been banned for that, and there was no rule against this. please let me post my server. (projectx3.servegame.com), also when it was banned it was Godscapepk.servegame.com if that means anything.

Thanks, `The One.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 03, 2008, 09:01:34 PM[/size][hr]Still no posts...Dosen&#39;t anybody have the same problem?</description>
