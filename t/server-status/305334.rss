    <title>Server Status</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-status/305334</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, i was wondering if anyone knows how to get server status/how many players online that i could put on my main page. I&#39;m currently using HTML to design my custom pages. I know its a bit more work, but i have a hard time understanding php. Thanks again. I&#39;ll put an example cuz i&#39;m not sure if it makes sense lol.

Ex: Server is (Online) with (20) players playing.

So a piece of code that says if server is online or offline
and a bit of code that gets how many players online.

Once again. Thanks.</description>
