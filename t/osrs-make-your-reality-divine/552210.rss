Hi guys,

We have moved over to a new dedicated server 
 
- The Armadyl Godsword special attack has now been buffed.
- Fixed combat formulas not including special attack bonuses.
[url=http://prntscr.com/7iay7q]http://prntscr.com/7iay7q[/url]

- Fixed multiple target spells not giving experience for all target hits.
- Fixed slayer streaks not saving.
- Fixed diamond amulets being enchanted into a ring of life instead of a amulet of power.
- Rewrote the fight modes in the combat formulas (which fixed the abyssal whip &#39;flick&#39; issue).

And here are some things to expect in the coming weeks...

- Rune pouch
- Hunger Games minigame
- A buff to the Jad Fight Caves minigame (32-63 waves; R.I.P fire capes :()
- Resizable client

Hi, sorry for making so many of these threads. I just wanted to get all of these done before Timupdates the server tomorrow.

- Ring of Recoil will now work on NPCs, previously it only worked on players.
- Fixed not being able to fletch willow longbow (u)&#39;s, previously you could only fletch shortbow (u)&#39;s.

[img]http://i.imgur.com/Sf1AYtJ.png[/img]

- Fixed superheating at any Smithing level, you now need the Smithing level that you would need if you were smelting.
- High alch damage now scales with your hitpoints level, can range anywhere from 1 to 16 percent of your REAL (your actual level, not your current level) hitpoints level (meaning at level 10HP the max hit is 2, and at level 99HP the max hit is 16). It seemed a bit unfair that lvl 3 skillers attempting to train magic were hit for 8/10 (80%) of their HP while people with 99 HP were only hit for 12/99 (12%).

- Rewrote bolt enchanting (which in turn fixed not being able to enchant diamond bolts).

[img]http://i.imgur.com/zUWcv5L.png[/img]

- Fixed the Ring of Wealth (i)&#39;s &quot;boss log&quot; not opening, it should open now.
- Wearing the Serpentine Helm will make you immune from poison and venom, Zulrah will now envenom players, certain NPCs will now have an immunity to venom.
- Fixed the Rune -&gt; Staff deletion issue, which in turn fixed the problem that some people were having with Mud Battlestaff&#39;s infinite runes ability not being recognized.

[img]http://i.imgur.com/6el9RSA.png[/img]

- Smoke devil&#39;s will now drop hard clues and not medium clues, all bosses will now drop elite clues and not hard clues.
- Fixed the issue where the slayer helm wouldn&#39;t give a boost when fighting your slayer task, it should now give a 15% damage and accuracy boost.

These updates along with the ones from earlier this morning will go live sometime tomorrow (or later on in the day if it&#39;s morning for you now). As usual, thanks for reading
