    <title>Clean, Basic Server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clean-basic-server/553238</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been looking around for a good server download that is as close to actual RuneScape as possible. I don&#39;t care too much about what version it is, so long as it&#39;s somewhere between 300 and 720. 

I tried out Matrix 718, but it has quite a bit of custom content and a lot of things weren&#39;t working. Although I&#39;m new to RSPSs, I&#39;ve made private servers for other games in the past (such as EverQuest and WoW), so I have no issue with the coding or anything. I&#39;m simply looking for a &quot;fresh&quot; server download that I can customize and eventually release. Are there any server downloads that are just basic RuneScape out there? Or even just a server that has custom content, but isn&#39;t so buggy?

Thank you!</description>

<p>There’s a few things you need to add to get it to function properly with the server. I believe prayer &amp; pk headicons need to be fixed or weird shit happens, such as not seeing text above your head, and not seeing any hitsplats or a hitpoints bar.<br>
And as sk8erdude also mentioned, NPC bits</p>

Last I recall basically any 317 client will work with it. Though on a couple of them you may have to change the npc/player bits to match the servers (or vice versa)</p>

              <p>Honestly what you’re asking for doesn’t really exist.</p>
<p>You say “clean” but then ask for runescape-esque features. That in itself is contradictory.</p>
<p>Your options are basically:<br>
Find a clean (And possibly stable) server/client.<br>
Find a package that has content you want and deal with the bugs/etc as they’re found (Most typical way, can cause frustration when you get to “unsolvable” bugs)<br>
Write your own.</p>
