    <description>I typed into google &#39;Lybia air strikes&#39; and found this article on world war 3 predictions, obviously these predications where just made up from true arguments the world is going through, and puzzled to make a almost real predication, but it won&#39;t happen.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nostradamus World War 3 Predictions
Nostradamus, the greatest seer of all times, had predicted several things thousands of years back and some of them have come true. Some researchers claims that he had also predicted the third world war. In his quatrains,while talking about the world war 3 predictions 2010, he had written (and all this is just the translation of what he had predicted) that there will be a war between USA and Western Europe and that Europe will suffer from a great economic loss. The third world war will probably start in the month of November and he also said that there might be a conflict between Britain and France. Nostradamus quatrains also states that &quot;the sky will burn at five and forty degrees. Fire approaches New York city.&quot; [b]The latitude of New York is around 45 degrees and the fire might be the nuclear explosion.[/b] These were some of Nostradamus predictions about the world war 3. Let us now see some of the other world war 3 predictions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The year 2011 will see an upheaval between Middle East and the Northern African Muslim countries, i.e. a fight between the Extremists and the Moderates and the former will win. The leaders of Iran and Iraq will have great control over the other Muslim nations. Same year, [b]the Extremists will attack the New York city probably with a nuclear bomb,[/b] and although the city won&#39;t be completely destroyed, the effects will be bad for the city. This will be like the starting point of the Third World War.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world war 3 predictions also state that the death toll will be even bigger than World War 1 and World War 2, combined. Nearly one-third of the population will die and the rest will suffer a lot. According to the world war 3 predictions, India and China will not take part in this war, hence, when almost all the countries will be destroyed, these two countries will be safe.[b] The predictions also state that this war will bring an end to the development of science and when (and if) the fourth world war takes place, people are going to fight with trees and twigs etc.[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
