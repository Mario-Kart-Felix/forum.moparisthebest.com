    <description>hiya,

When downloading a world of warcraft update switch off peer to peer, its just a way for blizzard to save bandwidth and money i guess. As if they need it but it clearly states here -

that peer 2 peer WILL increase your download speeds, hmm heres what results i got.

with peer 2 peer -

                           average download speed - 27kps
                           time to download           - flickering for 4-8 hours
                           max speed                    - 134kps (once every few mins it would climb then fall)

without peer 2 peer -

                           average download speed - 160kps
                           time to download           - 1hour 24 mins
                           max speed                    - 180kps if not more


is the info on the site wrong or am i wrong? please explain if anyone knows some more about this?</description>

              <p>So, you are a single person who is experiencing good speed without P2P.<br>
Now, split that up between 60 million people, from a single host. The entire WoW site would be offline within seconds.</p>
<p>So, in essence it’s not a lie. You’re just an exception abusing the system. I’ve always had 150kb/s+ speeds from the Blizzard downloader, if it wasn’t already uploaded on ausgamers. It’s far more difficult than you can ever imagine to provide bandwidth for such an intensive/large game &amp; site.</p>
