    <title>What happened to my idols?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-happened-to-my-idols/221844</link>
    <description>Seriously, what happened to my idols, that I used to idolise with such an unhealthy regiment it wasn&#39;t funny!
I remember the good old days when people like PaulT would make you think, question and quire! Unlucky the shit that plagues our General Discussion today.
I saw a total up rising and turn Mopar into what it used to be!
Viva la cliqued revolution!
In other news, I&#39;m bored and need some intelligent comments, I need people like lawl and xerxes!

<p>There is no doubt that he shows large amount of immaturity, though there have been plenty of time where he has shown a fair bit of intelligence. He is fairly capable of Java and has a fair bit of general knowledge. To be honest, i don’t even know why i am defending him but shrugs.</p>

              <p>Seriously, what happened to my idols, that I used to idolise with such an unhealthy regiment it wasn’t funny!<br>
I remember the good old days when people like PaulT would make you think, question and quire! Unlucky the shit that plagues our General Discussion today.<br>
I saw a total up rising and turn Mopar into what it used to be!<br>
Viva la cliqued revolution!<br>
In other news, I’m bored and need some intelligent comments, I need people like lawl and xerxes!<br>
