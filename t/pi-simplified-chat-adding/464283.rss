Have any of you gotten tired of going to actionhandler, find firstclicknpc, then do 
[code=java]
case NPCID:
	c.getDH().sendDialogues(DIALOGUEID, npcType);
	break;
[/code]

Well now, you can just do.

[code=java]
case NPCID:
	sendDialogues(DIALOGUEID, npcId);
	break;
[/code]

[hr]

[center][size=18pt][shadow=blue,left]Here&#39;s it in steps:[/shadow][/size][/center]

1) Go to DialogueHandler.java and below the constructor, add

[code=java]
	public void startDialogue(int npcId) {
		switch (npcId) {
		}
	}
[/code]

2) Go to ActionHandler.java and find
[code=java]
public void firstClickNpc(int npcType) {
[/code]
Below that line, add
[code=java]
		if (npcType != -1)
			c.getDH().startDialogue(npcType);
[/code]

[center][size=14pt][shadow=green,left]Finished![/shadow][/size][/center]

[hr]

[center][size=18pt][shadow=blue,left][i][s]Here&#39;s it in steps:[/s][/i] Explanation:[/shadow][/size][/center]

1) What we did in step 1 was add the new method we can use to call the dialogue. So, to add a new dialogue for lets say RuneScape Guide we&#39;d put the dialogue in sendDialogues
[code=java]
		case 21:
			sendNpcChat2(&quot;Greetings! I see you are a new arrival to this land. My&quot;, &quot;job is to welcome all new visitors. So welcome!&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 22;
			break;
		case 22:
			sendNpcChat2(&quot;You have already learned the first thing needed to&quot;, &quot;succeed in this world, talking to people!&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 23;
			break;
		case 23:
			sendNpcChat3(&quot;You will find many inhabitants of this world have useful&quot;, &quot;things to say to you. By clicking on them with your&quot;, &quot;mouse you can talk to them.&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 24;
			break;
		case 24:
			sendNpcChat4(&quot;I would also suggest reading through some of the&quot;, &quot;supporting information on the website. There you can&quot;, &quot;find the Knowledge Base, which contains all the&quot;, &quot;additional information you&#39;re ever like to need. It also&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 25;
			break;
		case 25:
			sendNpcChat2(&quot;contains maps and helpful tips to help you on your&quot;, &quot;journey&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 26;
			break;
		case 26:
			sendNpcChat2(&quot;You will notice a flashing icon of a spinner; please click&quot;, &quot;on this to continue the tutorial.&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 27;
			break;
		case 27:
			sendStartInfo(&quot;Player controls&quot;, &quot;Please click on the flashing spinner icon found at the bottom&quot;, &quot;right of your arrow. This will display your player controls.&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;);
			break;
		case 28:
			statement(&quot;@blu@Player Controls&quot;, &quot;On the side panel, you can now see a variety of options from&quot;, &quot;changing the brightness of the screen and the volume of&quot;, &quot;music, to selecting whether your player should accept help&quot;);
			break;
		case 29:
			infodia(&quot;from other players. Don&#39;t worry about these too much for now,&quot;, &quot;they will become clearer as you explore the game. Talk to the&quot;, &quot;RuneScape Guide to continue.&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Player Controls&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 29;
			break;
		case 30:
			sendNpcChat3(&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re making progress!&quot;, &quot;To continue the tutorial go through that door over&quot;, &quot;there and speak to your first instructor!&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 0;
			break;
[/code]

Then, we&#39;d call it with our new method, startDialogue
&lt;blockquote&gt;[center][b]How do I call it with the new method?[/b][/center]

To call it with startDialogue, you simple put under the switch statement

[code=java]
		case 945:
			sendDialogues(21, npcId);
			break;
[/code]

945 = RuneScape Guide&#39;s NPC ID
21 = Dialogue ID
npcId = what the switch is finding. Don&#39;t worry about that, just be sure to put npcId, not THE npc&#39;s id.

[quote]
[center][b]How do I call the dialogues for multiple conditions?[/b][/center]

What if I have an int called tutorial for the progress of them going to tutorial? Then what&#39;d I do?

Well, first, you&#39;d add your dialogue WITH the int. So instead of

[code=java]
		case 21:
			sendNpcChat2(&quot;Greetings! I see you are a new arrival to this land. My&quot;, &quot;job is to welcome all new visitors. So welcome!&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 22;
			break;
		case 22:
			sendNpcChat2(&quot;You have already learned the first thing needed to&quot;, &quot;succeed in this world, talking to people!&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 23;
			break;
		case 23:
			sendNpcChat3(&quot;You will find many inhabitants of this world have useful&quot;, &quot;things to say to you. By clicking on them with your&quot;, &quot;mouse you can talk to them.&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 24;
			break;
		case 24:
			sendNpcChat4(&quot;I would also suggest reading through some of the&quot;, &quot;supporting information on the website. There you can&quot;, &quot;find the Knowledge Base, which contains all the&quot;, &quot;additional information you&#39;re ever like to need. It also&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 25;
			break;
		case 25:
			sendNpcChat2(&quot;contains maps and helpful tips to help you on your&quot;, &quot;journey&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 26;
			break;
		case 26:
			sendNpcChat2(&quot;You will notice a flashing icon of a spinner; please click&quot;, &quot;on this to continue the tutorial.&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 27;
			break;
		case 27:
			sendStartInfo(&quot;Player controls&quot;, &quot;Please click on the flashing spinner icon found at the bottom&quot;, &quot;right of your arrow. This will display your player controls.&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;);
			break;
		case 28:
			statement(&quot;@blu@Player Controls&quot;, &quot;On the side panel, you can now see a variety of options from&quot;, &quot;changing the brightness of the screen and the volume of&quot;, &quot;music, to selecting whether your player should accept help&quot;);
			break;
		case 29:
			infodia(&quot;from other players. Don&#39;t worry about these too much for now,&quot;, &quot;they will become clearer as you explore the game. Talk to the&quot;, &quot;RuneScape Guide to continue.&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Player Controls&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 29;
			break;
		case 30:
			sendNpcChat3(&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re making progress!&quot;, &quot;To continue the tutorial go through that door over&quot;, &quot;there and speak to your first instructor!&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 0;
			break;
[/code]

We&#39;d do

[code=java]
		case 21:
			sendNpcChat2(&quot;Greetings! I see you are a new arrival to this land. My&quot;, &quot;job is to welcome all new visitors. So welcome!&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;RuneScape Guide&quot;);

			c.nextChat = 29;

			c.nextChat = 31;

[i]		case 28:

[/quote]

So that&#39;s describing what the tutorial progress level is. So now it&#39;s one, and in the next area I&#39;m saying to

[quote]
[i]		case 29:
			infodia(&quot;from other players. Don&#39;t worry about these too much for now,&quot;, &quot;they will become clearer as you explore the game. [/i][b]Talk to the&quot;, &quot;RuneScape Guide to continue.[/b][i]&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Player Controls&quot;);[/i]
[i]			c.nextChat = 29;
			break;[/i]
[/quote]

Now you&#39;re probably going,
[quote author=You]
Different thing to happen when I am using this startDialogue thing. I don&#39;t know what to do.
[/quote]
Well, all you need to do is add an if statement OR switch statement.

So, in the startDialogue case 945 I added, I&#39;d modify it to,

[code=java]
		case 945:
			if (c.tutorial == 0) {
				sendDialogues(21, npcId);
			} else if (c.tutorial == 1) {
				sendDialogues(30, npcId);
			}
			break;
[/code]

[size=12pt][b]OR[/b][/size]

[code=java]
		case 945:
			switch (c.tutorial) {
			case 0:
				sendDialogues(21, npcId);
				break;
			case 1:
				sendDialogues(30, npcId);
				break;
			}
			break;
[/code]

I prefer switch statements but it depends on your flavor.
[/quote]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

2) What we did in step 2 was add an if statement

[code=java]
                if (npcType != -1)
                        c.getDH().startDialogue(npcType);
[/code]

If npcType (what the switch statement in the method finds) is not -1 (basically for all npc id as there is no npc id that is -1). To simplify, this applies for every case number we put. So, if npcType is not -1, start that dialogue.
[code=java]
c.getDH().startDialogue(npcType);
[/code]
So this calls our case numbers for every npc id there is on the server and if the id matches with the id we put in the case statement, start that dialogue.

<p>Then, we’d call it with our new method, startDialogue</p>

<p>To call it with startDialogue, you simple put under the switch statement</p>

<p>945 = RuneScape Guide’s NPC ID<br>
21 = Dialogue ID<br>
npcId = what the switch is finding. Don’t worry about that, just be sure to put npcId, not THE npc’s id.</p>

<p>Different thing to happen when I am using this startDialogue thing. I don’t know what to do.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, all you need to do is add an if statement OR switch statement.</p>
<p>So, in the startDialogue case 945 I added, I’d modify it to,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		case 945:
			if (c.tutorial == 0) {
				sendDialogues(21, npcId);
			} else if (c.tutorial == 1) {
				sendDialogues(30, npcId);

<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">OR</span>[/size]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		case 945:
			switch (c.tutorial) {
			case 0:
				sendDialogues(21, npcId);
				break;
			case 1:
				sendDialogues(30, npcId);
				break;
			}
			break;</code></pre>
<p>I prefer switch statements but it depends on your flavor.<br>
[/quote]</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>What we did in step 2 was add an if statement</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">                if (npcType != -1)
                        c.getDH().startDialogue(npcType);</code></pre>
<p>If npcType (what the switch statement in the method finds) is not -1 (basically for all npc id as there is no npc id that is -1). To simplify, this applies for every case number we put. So, if npcType is not -1, start that dialogue.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">c.getDH().startDialogue(npcType);</code></pre>
<p>So this calls our case numbers for every npc id there is on the server and if the id matches with the id we put in the case statement, start that dialogue.</p>
