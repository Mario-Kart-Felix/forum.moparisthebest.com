Jesus Christ you blind idiots. Did anyone care to notice I stopped managing this thread. You want to know why? None of you have any god damn care to actually try and save a community. So instead, I went through and downloaded some of the OLD work that is still up for download (Not many, sadly). Because this site has a history, and you know what? We should try to save what we can of it. But no, instead you morons want to waste your time bitching how I&#39;m &quot;stealing&quot; work or getting it for my own private use. The work has been RELEASED. meaning anyone can have access to it. I wanted people to send it to me, because most would be taken off the internet before I had a chance to get to it because JaGex decided to actually take a bit of initiative towards RSPS&#39;s, because yes, they ARE illegal, but instead of suing us as a whole, they were just removing out works.

Oh and to Shabba 56.
Since you think I&#39;m trying to get money out of this. I really am not. I&#39;ve got a webhost that provides more than what I need, for like $10 a month. I could easily host 100gbs of private servers, and still have room for what ever else I please. Cause it&#39;s only 10 god damn dollars. You can find that shit on the street. So quit your god damn bitching and get the hell off my thread.

It was dead anyways till some idiot brought it back.[/b][/quote]

Alright guys. We&#39;ve all seen it. We all know what is happening. Jagex is finally putting the fist down on our servers. They don&#39;t want it online, what so ever. So I&#39;m here to attempt to collect as much as we can. and archive it. So when we figure out a solution, we&#39;ll have a good starting point.
I&#39;ve got 2 servers that had been released on here (A 2006Scape, and a PVP server).
I have 150GBs allocated to store these servers, and it will not be damaged what so ever.
If you guys have any server that HAS BEEN RELEASED, or you are willing to send a copy. Do so. I&#39;d like the information for it too. Meaning the topic you found it in. Just quote it, copy all that. Save into a text file.

Mods: please don&#39;t lock/remove this. I&#39;m trying to save some of the &quot;Old days&quot; before runescape kills it again..

Oh and you did say something about getting people to donate. Donation = money. Money = profit.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I doubt many will donate to this.  I had a server up for a couple months, and got enough donations to keep it up, but just barely.  If not many people donate to a server for benefits and items, what makes you think they’ll donate to a website that will require masses of bandwidth?  Now given that some basic leeched ass server can pull in 3x the donations I got, that just proves the randomness and riskiness of relying on people.</p>

<p>Do you even know how this works?  Some caches for servers are 100mb in size.  Lets say one server has a 1tb monthly limit (like my old vps).  This means that you’ll run out of bandwidth after 10,000 downloads you’ll be out of data transfer, and that’s the cache alone.  Doesn’t seem too bad, but then you have to look at the fact that we have thousands of downloads happening here every day, you could probably reach that limit in a few weeks considering there are many other servers they can get.</p>
<p>Also, a dedicated server (needed unless you want everyone to have 30kb/s rates/have your site unreachable at times due to traffic) will run at least $60, not to mention multiple ones.[/quote]<br>
Are you just a pure idiot?<br>
I called the damn project over a while ago. Jesus Christ. I mean, it’s in red and bold on the original post.</p>

              <p>Jesus Christ you blind idiots. Did anyone care to notice I stopped managing this thread. You want to know why? None of you have any god damn care to actually try and save a community. So instead, I went through and downloaded some of the OLD work that is still up for download (Not many, sadly). Because this site has a history, and you know what? We should try to save what we can of it. But no, instead you morons want to waste your time bitching how I’m “stealing” work or getting it for my own private use. The work has been RELEASED. meaning anyone can have access to it. I wanted people to send it to me, because most would be taken off the internet before I had a chance to get to it because JaGex decided to actually take a bit of initiative towards RSPS’s, because yes, they ARE illegal, but instead of suing us as a whole, they were just removing out works.</p>
<p>Oh and to Shabba 56.<br>
Since you think I’m trying to get money out of this. I really am not. I’ve got a webhost that provides more than what I need, for like $10 a month. I could easily host 100gbs of private servers, and still have room for what ever else I please. Cause it’s only 10 god damn dollars. You can find that shit on the street. So quit your god damn bitching and get the hell off my thread.</p>
<p>It was dead anyways till some idiot brought it back.</p>

<p>i can tell you dont go on rs mum go log on look at the world lists there is 60% loss in rs not including bots i said rs is dead not rsps you should read more carefully also with the website its to host not be linked here as they are asking for source / client’s he uploads to the new site that isnt linked here i havent seen any good coders here or on r-s or r-l for a few months since jagex is cracking down as i said before gl this will fail</p>
