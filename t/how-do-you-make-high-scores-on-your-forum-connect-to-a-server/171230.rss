<p>First you have to have your java store the hiscores stuff in mysql, then you have to have php read it. Theres no simpler way to put it. I found a <a href="http://www.google.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">site</a> that will teach you how.</p>

              <p>Mysql is hardly a language. Its a way to store data. Another example of things that store data:<br>
XML, configuration files(ini), <span class="bbcode-b">SQL</span>.<br>
The “code” is just how you retrieve and insert data.</p>
