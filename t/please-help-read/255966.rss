    <description>Ok, i got registerd with no-ip. I put a no-ip in with port 43594 and my ip and the no-ip thing is godscapepkz.no-ip.biz

How should i connect to my server?

It says:    godscapepkz.no-ip.biz: DNS is current, no update needed.

Says on the website under Hosts:

godscapepkz.no-ip.biz                 My.ip.adress:43594                  modify,remove, stats


When i put my mouse over the No ip thing at the toolbar at the botem, it says: No-Ip DUC v2.2.1: my.ip.adress


Please someone help


*Note: Im brand new and I belive this is the spot to ask for help. I see many people with no-ip&#39;s and i realy want some help here!
