    <title>Help with Ints and Model Number?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-ints-and-model-number/240020</link>
    <description>Ok so i made a really nice staff and i want to release it and put it in my server but I&#39;m stuck.

I have made it from .dat and .gzipped it and I&#39;m stuck there. I know i have to have my own ants and model number but I am really confused with it like for the ints am i supposed to come up with my own hoping it will work or do i base it of something and the model number? I have no clue what I&#39;m doing and I tried learning from tutorials but no one has a actual tutorial on it. I have tried Google and Search nothing from what I have seen.

Some one helped by telling me that if its a weapon Copy and Paste the Bandos Godsword ints i tried that and it didn&#39;t work so I&#39;m thinking that i have to come up with my own ints and model number. So this is as far i have gotten

[code]		        if(i == 15334){
				            class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
				            class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
				            class8.anIntArray156 = new int[1];
				            class8.anIntArray160 = new int[1];
							class8.anIntArray156[0] = 0;
							class8.anIntArray160[0] = 0;
							class8.anInt174 = 7354;//item look
							class8.anInt181 = 1957;
							class8.anInt190 = 498;
							class8.anInt198 = 484;
							class8.anInt204 = 0;
							class8.anInt169 = -1;
							class8.anInt194 = -1;
							class8.anInt165 = 7355;
							class8.anInt200 = 7244;
							class8.anInt175 = -1;
							class8.anInt197 = -1;
				            class8.aString170 = &quot;Bandos godsword &quot;;
				            class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;A great weapon, used by the best warriors.&quot;.getBytes();[/code]

That is the Bandos Godsword ints and what not. From my understanding and I hope I am right is that these
[code]class8.anInt174 = 7354;//item look[/code]
[code]class8.anInt165 = 7355[/code]
[code]class8.anInt200 = 7244[/code]

Have something to do with the model number. Problem is i don&#39;t know what the model number is for my weapon and i don&#39;t know how to find out

That&#39;s pretty much all I have learned from just looking and comparing Model numbers and other ints.

I really need help for this because I really want to learn. I have gotten really good at creating items on Meta and I want to learn how to release them.

Anyone help? :D please and thx</description>
