    <title>Google Earth Reveals 2-Acre Weed Patch to Swiss Police</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Google Earth has helped police in Switzerland bust a marijuana farm suspected of doing up to $8.7 million a year in business. The police were initially using the application to locate a suspect&#39;s address, but as they scanned the view, they happened to glimpse the 2-acre farm, which was surrounded by rows of corn plants.[/b]

Swiss police said Thursday they stumbled across a large marijuana plantation while using Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) Earth, the search engine company&#39;s satellite mapping software.

Police said the find was part of a bigger investigation that led to the arrest of 16 people and seizure of 1.2 tons (1.1 metric tons) of marijuana as well as cash and valuables worth 900,000 Swiss francs (US$780,000).
&#39;Chance Discovery&#39;
Officers discovered the hemp field in the northeastern canton (state) of Thurgau last year while investigating an alleged drug ring, said the head of Zurich police&#39;s specialist narcotics unit Norbert Klossner.

The plantation, measuring almost two acres (7,500 square meters), was hidden inside a field of corn.

But officers using Google Earth to locate the address of two farmers suspected of involvement in the drug operation quickly spotted the illegal crop.

&quot;It was an interesting chance discovery,&quot; said Klossner.
16 Suspects

Prosecutor Gabi Alkalay told reporters in Zurich that she plans to complete her criminal investigation in February, after which she will formally charge the 16 suspects and ask for prison sentences for all of them.

The gang is alleged to have sold up to 7 tons (7.7 US tons) of hashish and marijuana between 2004 and 2008, with an annual turnover of 3-10 million francs ($2.6 million to $8.7 million) a year, officials said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
