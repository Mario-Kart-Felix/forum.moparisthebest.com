    <description>Hello, was testing mining and the batching of it.

It mines 9 times a row if you&#39;re 99 mining yes..
But the batching should be 9 times if you&#39;re failing utill you get a ore = stop.

Not like it is right now even if you get a ore it continue mining.. so you can get up to 9 ores at a time.. and sometimes you get 3x ores in 1 mining retry.

and the best of it the longer you mine, the faster u get ores cause the loop leaves on
... 

No author good.. i would&#39;ve teached him a lesson about calling same method inside method!!</description>

              <p>Are ‘batched’ skills going to be on moparrsc?</p>
<p><code>owner.getActionSender().sendMessage("You manage to obtain some " + ore.getDef().getName() + ".");
owner.setSkillLoops(0);

setSkillLoops doesn’t stop the loop?</p>
<p>Eh I don’t have a plugin system (yet) on my version :S so idk</p>

Nothing to do with that, since the server source was completely changed, not to mention that was removed 3 days ago :P.</p>
