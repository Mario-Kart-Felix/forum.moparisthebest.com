<p>So if there are parts of the country where religion is taught over science, that’s okay because it’s what the teachers/parents believe in?</p>

              <p>No, I am not a religious person at all, I’m not going to sit here and bore you with my theories (Yes, I have theories, I know it really wouldn’t seem like it huh?) but simply the fact that there really is no god, theres no sense why if there was a god, why wouldn’t there be proof of this? I know theres no proof that theres not a god, but I am not religious for I believe there isn’t anything greater than a human being (Not saying I don’t believe in aliens but thats a different subject.). I believe in Karma because I know its real after I broke into 3 houses and got sent to jail for 4.5 months, the worst time of my life. While I was in there, I had time to think, I prayed and nothing happened, I believed in god for 3 months I was in there, nothing happened that I wanted to happen, nothing. Still was in that bitch, still was eating shit everyday, still people started fights and riots. I went to church in there as much as possible, all they would really tell me if I believe and pray things will work out, but it never did. I stopped believing weeks before my court date, and I still got out on my court date. This may not be a good reason to believe in religion or not. I think it is… Whenever I get asked, I tell them I have no religion, because religion is just based on belief and money, do you really think that Christianity would be around if there was no money to be made it in? This world runs on money and thats another reasons why I don’t believe in it.</p>
<p>But all in all, I still say God Damn, Why me God? Etc, just was born and raised that way, doesn’t mean I actually believe in a god :P.</p>

              <p>Religious faith belongs to the sinister, spoiled, selfish childhood of our species. Of course, a five-year-old with an imaginary friend is cute. A twenty-five year old with an imaginary friend is just disturbing. Put simply, it’s time to grow up, and put away these childish things.</p>
<p>It belongs to the terrified childhood of our species, before we knew about germs or could account for earthquakes. It belongs to our childhood, too, in the less charming sense of demanding a tyrannical authority: a protective parent who demands compulsory love even as he exacts a tithe of fear.</p>

              <p>I was born a catholic. But it doesn’t sound very real to me. I was talking to a priest at my church a few weeks ago. He told me he tells the people that go to church that they’re <span class="bbcode-b">soul</span> will go to heaven. <span class="bbcode-b">YOU</span> don’t go to heaven. So I think what teachers in schools are teaching their students is a little over exaggerated. I spoke to my religion teacher about what the priest told me. And my teacher thought I was crazy, he was denying everything. He was nervous when I asked him these questions as well.</p>
