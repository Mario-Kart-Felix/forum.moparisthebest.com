    <title>Cheating and general help Crash Course</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cheating-and-general-help-crash-course/4482</link>
    <description>Hey!

I&#39;m new to these forums, and I must admit, I was [i]very[/i] relieved to find such a good forum. I was stuck on RSCN and, while it was decent, most topics usually ended with f&#39;*** u&#39;...anyways, I&#39;m glad to have found this, and like it a lot. Now on to my questions:

I used to use SCAR, and used Mopar&#39;s willow cutter. I then stopped for a long while, and am just now taking it up again, so I&#39;m not exactly new to the world of RS cheating  :cool:. Some scripts don&#39;t work, but that&#39;s for another time and another place what I would like to know here are two things. 


The first: What happened to Sythe.org and Kaitnieks.com? Those were completely awesome sights. How&#39;d they get killed? Also, could someone just bring me up to speed on RS cheating, what&#39;s changed over the past...year :|.


I&#39;m also planning on learning SCAR. Would it be best if I first learned conventional Pascal, and then did a SCAR tutorial, or should I scip learning &#39;conventional&#39; Pascal, and go straight to the SCAR tutorial.


Basically, what I&#39;d like is just a crash course, or something to bring me up to speed on the current (and late) happenings, as well as any other general things I should know, and where I should focus my efforts. As soon as I figure out where the cheating community&#39;s at..I might be able to contribute more. ;D


Thank you all, and I look forward to being a memeber! (rather, I already am...)[br][size=1]Posted at: July 07, 2006, 12:38:56 PM[/size][hr]oh yes..I forgot- What is Moparscape? What does it do and stuff?

Thanks!</description>

<p>The first: Sythe is still up, and not dead. lol. but kaitnieks is dead cuz kaitnieks left.<br>
Things that have changed are…well…rs engine is redesigned, and therefor, randoms are harder to solve and its been gettin harder to script. thankfully, there is the SRL out (Scar Resource Library). It is the only include you will ever need <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Second: I learned scar without learning pascal, and its probably harder, but you can learn fast. If you have the time, though, you can learn pascal is u wanna.</p>
<p>Moparscape used to be used as a runescape client, but now, it cna only work on private clients.</p>
