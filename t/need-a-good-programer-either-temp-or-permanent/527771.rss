    <description>Today at 01:39:17 PM
I have self taught my self how to code/progrAm as far as i could get on my own i specialize more in ownership and web design my sel which is why i need a good coder to help code and maintain my server this code/program position will mostly be done thru teamviewer on my pc so i can learn while you work if that is ok with you! If not pm me a different solution. My server at the moment is not on a paid website or a paid online server. What i am doing since i have played literally 100&#39;s of different servers and seen all the good and bad and i am tryin to put all the good ive seen into my server i had already coded alot and fixed alot my self and have a webclient on my personal website i havent registered it yet because there are still some things that need fixxed that i cannot figure out. I have more details if your interested pm me on here or add me on skype

Hoping i find someone even if your just wanting to help temporarily you do not have to stay if you do not want too but i preffer a full time coder:)

The client/source is a 317 (forgot to mention)

Thanks for your time!!!</description>

              <p>It’s also hilarious how they expect their server to be the next one to have 50k+ on at peak hours and pulling in millions of dollars a month XD I wonder if they’d toss a bone to their overworked dev then =P</p>
