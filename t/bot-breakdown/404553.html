        <blockquote>We at Jagex are keenly aware of the botting issues within RuneScape and know how disruptive they can be to our game. Whether it’s using a macro program to control an account or power levelling, it’s safe to say that it’s something that we’re all united in fighting and from the support you give us on the forums, in game and when we meet face to face, it’s crystal clear that it’s something that you; the RuneScape community, also feel very strongly about.
<p>That’s why today we want to take a few moments to reaffirm our dedication to the removal of bots and cheats from RuneScape.</p>
<p>We are constantly looking into ways of making the game experience the very best possible for all of our players and as part of our on-going programme to rid the game of bots, Jagex is actively pursuing companies that support the macroing market as well as those who bot. As such we are currently pursuing various bot developers through multiple legal channels, although sadly we cannot yet disclose the full details of our actions for legal reasons. Separately, as part of normal legal process and procedure, we have also taken steps to acquire the details of all players who have purchased bots.<br>
Once we have the information regarding the players involved we will take action specifically to ensure that these players are not compromising the game’s integrity through the use of a third party programs. We are committed to undertaking various initiatives to identify players and companies who are using and distributing bots within RuneScape and will endeavour to inform you all of these efforts as we can.<br>
In the meantime, be safe, don’t fall to the dark side and we look forward to the positive outcomes of our actions ultimately making the game experience a better one for everyone.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Daniel Clough</p>

        <p>I don’t blame them. There are way too many bots and cheaters out there that make the game pointless. It’s why I don’t play anymore, but I played Runescape for over 5 years and I want to still play it.</p>

Information put into a place like that can be distributed anywhere they want? It would be illegal if they acquired it by illegal means, and they can’t be forced to hand the information over, but the botting companies could hand the information over any time they want. (In case you didn’t know, some people make a lot of money selling user information, it’s perfectly legal unless they have some sort of privacy statement)</p>

<p>You ever heard of the bomb-check packet dumb ass?<br>
Jagex recently went over the 255 packet limit as of ~2-3 revisions ago. Meaning they added more packets, now what do these packets do? Good question. And here is your answer.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    final int getPacketId(int i)
    {
        anInt10166++;
        int j = 0xff &amp; super.buffer[super.seek_req++] - encryption.pop((byte)126);
        if(j &lt; 128)
            return j;
        else
            return (super.buffer[super.seek_req++] - encryption.pop((byte)126) &amp; 0xff) + (-128 + j &lt;&lt; 8);
