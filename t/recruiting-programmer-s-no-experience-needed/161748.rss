    <title>Recruiting Programmer(s), No experience Needed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/recruiting-programmer-s-no-experience-needed/161748</link>
    <description>          I&#39;m creating a new project that is unfinished and isn&#39;t even ready for beta. I have some experience in java programming and I understand some of the coding in most source&#39;s. If you do not know how to code servers very well or at all I can teach you basics and some. If you do know how to code than you can be very helpful for this project. I&#39;m not giving anything but knowledge so you do not have to join if you don&#39;t want to.  If you would like to join it would be very helpful if you had some sort of Instant Messenger, otherwise it would be a pain to contact you and communicate. After you gain trust and enough knowledge you will receive the source, however you shouldn&#39;t be spreading it to anyone unless you are on the team. It should and probably will be enjoyable if you do join the team so I do suggest it :). Just post your email, name, experience, and the messenger you use. You don&#39;t have to join if you don&#39;t want to so I would rather not receive any replies if you&#39;re not joining, thank you.

Example:
Name: Tom
Email: Mister.zer0@hotmail.com
Experience: I&#39;ve coded a few servers and I&#39;m somewhat knowledgable with using java and coding servers.
Messenger: -MSN-, Yahoo, Aim.

Thank you for reading.

Well if that happened than I’d drop them from the team. If they don’t want to learn they can leave. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
