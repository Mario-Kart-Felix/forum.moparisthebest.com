    <description>[center]Well I&#39;ve recently been curious about Python scripting and it seems alot easyer to implement Python and base skills, minigames, eating etc off that.
What do you guys think.

Question:
How do I get Python?

Where could I learn Python?

Is it better to do main server features in Python?

If I was to get Python, how would I add it into my source?


Thanks. Please reply guys. :o[/center]</description>
