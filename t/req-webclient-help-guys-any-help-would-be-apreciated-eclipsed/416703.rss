    <description>If I posted this in the wrong place PLEASE FEEL FREE TO MOVE IT Thank you!!!

First of all I wanna say hi to all you boys and girls and say I apreciate all the help you give me
So basicly I need someone to add the code into my client to turn it into a webclient
as I have followed Rics webclient tutorial and many other webclient tutorials and all of them fail to work
I know how to Jar and Sign the webclient once it has been made so I would apreciate it allot if
someone took the time to make the client in the download link below into a webclient ready to be jared and signed!!
Once the webclient is made can you upload it to www.Uppit.com and leave a reply on this thread 
below saying the link to it!!

Client Link:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- bit is the client link
