    <description>Hello my name is Flame, i&#39;ve been working with private servers for quite awhile and i am very experinced, I can host\code it so it has the servers name everything etc blah blah....

System - - - -- - - - - - - - - - 4GB ram, 1000gb (yeah i bought gb sticks ) i can host it 24/7 and i am running windows vista.-----------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What i want in return, either a runescape account (A good one...) or official co-owner\coder on your server even though I would have acess to the files xD
I am actively on everyday and can handle much ... You can contact me skype\yahoo, and preferably MSN - MT12094@hotmail.com..
However, what i would not want would be an @$$-hole owner.
--------------------------------
My Team:
--------------------------------
Me
Nonamee(Assistant)
Skorz (Java Coder)
---What i&#39;m looking for in the owner---
1. Must be dedicated with the server dont quit the first week just because either people dont play OR your getting tired of the server..
2. Must be actively on daily, so i can contact you if something goes wrong..
----------------------------------------------
Note: Those are my TWO MAIN things im looking for. theres other small things but not as important.
Contact me MSN - Mt12094@hotmail.com
I have a laptop that runs the server
and a computer that can code the server.</description>
