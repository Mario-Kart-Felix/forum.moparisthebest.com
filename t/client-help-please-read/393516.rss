    <description>Ive got compiler and all that fixed, coded which took me while this morning ,and got server online and all, put advertisment up,changed setip to my client(so i thought), then uploaded my client.
-i went on bros computer to test out so downloaded client on there and it wouldnt let me log on..&quot;error connecting to server&quot;

i think its client still somehow since its not connecting to my server when its not on my computer.
can some1 please help me? preferbly some1 with teamviewer since im kinda new at coding but if i read it i should be able to do long as it isnt hard.
-problem is i think i alrdy got set ip. (it said setserver:&quot;my ip&quot;)</description>
