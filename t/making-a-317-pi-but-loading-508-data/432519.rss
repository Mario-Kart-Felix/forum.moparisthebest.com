    <title>Making a 317 [pi] but loading 508+ data</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-317-pi-but-loading-508-data/432519</link>
    <description>hello all,
a little bit about myself.. currently 16 years old been coding for a year and a half now and i want to take my server to the next level but  i cannot do it alone. i currently am working on a new server due to the fact i have NOTHING to do since basketball season is over.this server will be a bi based [old soulsplit base i got off my friend pim (owner of soulsplit no leeching) and a client i found just around the fourms] that i can change with the help of a good co-co coder. reason why i am doing this you may ask? I have a few friends with quite successful servers and i would like to join them. they make good money per month and i would like a peace of that, of course if you join my server as a professional coder i will pay you(as we all know no one likes working for free!)


payment as fallows (after all server expenses are payed)

i will share profit with my co coder at the rate of 30%  ( for the reasons i will do advertisements coding and running the server).

out of my 70% i&#39;ll pay a fourm mod 3-5% for designing and maintaining the fourms.

i have big plans for this server and i plan to take it far. if you would like to join me in this goal please fill out the fourms below!
