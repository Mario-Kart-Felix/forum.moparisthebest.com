    <title>Help me with my 100 errors... Again</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-with-my-100-errors-again/281560</link>
    <description>Yo guys, after deleteing 3 voids so save a server confliction, i now have 100 errors... I think im missing a {, but i just don&#39;t no... I go to the last line on my compiler  11292, because it says

class, interface, or enum expected
}
^

So, i tried removing it, adding more but still 100 errors...

Please help!!

If i can&#39;t fix this it would of been a waste of 1-2 weeks of coding! What i should be been revising instead!!

Please Please help!!

If you can help me, send me ur email over pm (So no-one spams) And ill get TeamViewer set up so you can have a look, if wished.

Thanks in Advance!!
