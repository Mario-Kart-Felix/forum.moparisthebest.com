    <title>Vista And Server Restarters</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vista-and-server-restarters/111492</link>
    <description>With the release of Windows Vista a lot of programs have lost complete compatibility. People who run vista may have noticed the issue with server re starters and not being able to end the server and restart it. The issue is with a command change that vista has changed the command text to. with Windows XP The command was tskill. With the release of Vista the command has changed to TASKKILL. So if you get into the batch file that restarts the server, youll want to erase the line with tskill and replace it with

[code]TASKKILL /F /IM java.exe[/code]

MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO USE THE TWO / OPTIONS OR THIS WILL NOT WORK!

 :)

Hope it helps someone.</description>
