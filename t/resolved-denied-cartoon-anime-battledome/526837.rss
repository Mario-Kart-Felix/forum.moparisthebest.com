    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED] Cartoon/Anime BattleDome</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-cartoon-anime-battledome/526837</link>
    <description>I thought it would be fun if we did a Battledome section where people post threads in a certain format
Ex:
Place: in a gym
Opponents: Naruto v Ichigo
Restrictions: No jitsus, no spirit reaper. Just hand to hand combat
Shippuden naruto vs Ichigo
 Don&#39;t answer  its just an example. where people can state their opinion or give and take. I seen this through several forums. I thought this would be fun to do</description>

<p>Like, its like a dream battle between favorable tv show or comic characters. Like superman vs Goku Eg.<br>
And battledome is for thread starters to start the requirements and people like you and me<br>
discuss who would win and why.</p>
