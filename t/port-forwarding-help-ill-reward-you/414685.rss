try portforwarding the old fashion way? <a href="http://192.168.1.1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://192.168.1.1</a>  - - Enter your router details  and then portforward<br>
More help can be found here (old fashioned way) <a href="http://www.portforward.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.portforward.com</a><br>
Also if the 162.168.1.1 doesn’t work, try going to start and searching for ‘run’<br>
Then type ‘cmd’ and when command prompt comes up, type<br>
ipconfig<br>
Find ‘Default Gateway’ and don’t close the cmd window, but remember the number<br>
Now you go to that ip in your web browser. then right before you portforward, if your using the same computer as me, go to Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Network and Internet&gt;Network &amp; Sharing center&gt; to the left you should see<br>
something that says “access type: internet Homegroup…” ect, click the last one which should be wireless network connection. Then click Proporties when a box pops up then find 'Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)<br>
Highlight that then click proporties again. Then click 'use the following ip adress" and type in that default gateway in but change the last number to w/e you want but REMEMBER IT. click subnet mask, which should automatically fill in.<br>
Example: My router: 192.168.1.1 my new ip for it: 192.168.1.9<br>
Then put the default gateway into the default gateway spot, do not change this one. - Same with the dns server.<br>
Press okay.<br>
Then portforward using your NEW ip, this is the one you change just slightly.<br>
Hope this helped XD Took awhile to type.</p>
