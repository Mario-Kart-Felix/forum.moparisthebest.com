    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tried-to-buy-gold-from-a-website/424732</link>
    <description>[code][David] Welcome, how may I help you? 
[Visitor] I bought 100M from you recently
[David] May I have your payment email and character name please?
[Visitor] *	*(Hidden for a reason)
[David] Please hold on, I will check on that.
[David] Our paypal is currently down due to technical problems, therefore all payments through paypal are unavailable. There is, however, an alternative method of payment via Western Union, and an extra gold bonus will apply for all payments using this method. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
[David] You can pay via Western Union as fast as paypal. If you like, I can tell u the instructions.
First, I assume you have a credit card, so you can sign up one account in http://westernunion.com.

Then I will give you the information of western union account. You can choose &quot;send money&quot; to my account.

After that, you will get a serial number called &quot;MTCN&quot;. Please give that number, your first name and last name to us.
Then we will call western union to make sure if we have received the money.

[David] ★our wu account : First Name: Huajing   Last Name:  Xu    Country: China
[Visitor] Why should I? I see no reason in paying with another service, cosidering the time it has been since i have payed.
[David] we cant do the delivery unless u pay with western union for a new order
[Visitor] For what reasons can i not just recieve something i have payed for already?
[David] if u pay with western union for another 100M,then you can get the paypal one too
[Visitor] But that does not explain why i cannot explain why i cannot get it even though i payed for it already?
[David] our paypal has problems now
[David] we cant pick up money right now
[Visitor] Since Jun 14, 2011 you have had problems, that is a little strange.
[David] the rule is picking up money before the trade
[David] but we cant do that now
[David] though you can make a new order via western unon as guarantee
[David] then we can deliver the paypal one as well
[Visitor] Explain what is wrong with your PayPal?
[David] technical problems
[Visitor] That&#39;s telling a blind person what red is, It doesn&#39;t explain much.[/code]

Does this seem.... Strange?

Edit: I seem to have this f*r cornered.</description>

<p>Same concept as sythe, except your chances of getting scammed are a lot lower (there are no impersonators etc) and you wont have to wait as long for a reply, and the order system will track everything for you. And then you can see the positive AND negative replies of people, not only the positives they decide to count as ‘vouches’.</p>

3. [Player - Middleman (NOT A PERSON) - Player] transactions are the safest. Things like Playerauctions, with a money back guarantee for BOTH people, have no reason to scam you because they get more money if the transaction is completed.

Actually, they do pay for their accounts. Trust me, I won’t say why, others know, but they do pay ;)[/quote]<br>
They have legit accounts yes, but a day before the recoveries will get transferred to you, they lock the account.<br>
Then they’ll give you a new one, and continue to do the same thing.<br>
My friend went through 6 accounts before he gave up.</p>
