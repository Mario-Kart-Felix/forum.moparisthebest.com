    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reflection-help-i-am-smart/327948</link>
    <description>I am Colt on RSBot and I do know java and have written a few scripts.  I wrote a runescape loader that loads both signed and unsigned versions of runescape.  Now I want to know how to find the correct hooks in the obfuscated client.  My theory is that I can load up all the fields in the runescape applet and print their name and value repeatedly and search for the value of the hook I want.  Is there a way to do this and is it practical?  Or is there a better way.  If someone would suggest de-obfuscating the client, I am totally clueless on how one would do that.  400 a&#39;s, b&#39;s, and pb.ac&#39;s are quite confusing.

I also tried using jdb, but it is really annoying because it works almost nothing like the gnu gdb and is very non-standard and the help is disorganized.  Is gdb the key to cracking runescape?  I also have another theory that I can search for 100 in iHaxGames (It&#39;s like cheat engine) so that I can find the address of the run energy field and then trace back through java to find where that memory was declared in the class files.

As you can see, I am either close or totally clueless.  Help appreciated.</description>

?? no...
you want to make your updater strong, so you want to find a pattern that will possibly ALWAYS stay constant, such as [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,419463.0.html]NPC debug[/url]

If someone would suggest de-obfuscating the client, I am totally clueless on how one would do that.  400 a’s, b’s, and pb.ac’s are quite confusing.</p>
<p>I also tried using jdb, but it is really annoying because it works almost nothing like the gnu gdb and is very non-standard and the help is disorganized.  Is gdb the key to cracking runescape?  I also have another theory that I can search for 100 in iHaxGames (It’s like cheat engine) so that I can find the address of the run energy field and then trace back through java to find where that memory was declared in the class files.</p>
<p>As you can see, I am either close or totally clueless.  Help appreciated.</p>
