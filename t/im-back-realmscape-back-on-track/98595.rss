    <title>Im back, RealmScape back on track!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-back-realmscape-back-on-track/98595</link>
    <description>Hello,

not many of use know me but those of you who do know that i help out as much as i can
and help everyone with their private servers, i believe everyone deserves to have their own.

But i dissapeared for a while back, this is because either one of my windows files got corupt or
a vicious virus deleted a file, and i had dell back and forth replacing parts untill they finally came
to the conclusion that it was my hardrive.

This is awfull because i was working on a sever source for use guys called RealmScape which is a sever
which allows you to have multiple worlds, is has many added java and class files added,

After they told me i had to wipe my hardrive i was upset because i would lose RealmScape. But
what i did is i loaded Linux Mandriva onto my computer and found my files in the C:/ drive using the Linux OS
and uploaded them to a site which i then wiped my hard drive and got my files back by re-downloading them.

So this is good news for use and just letting you know im back to working on RealmScape and look forward
to meeting more people and helping people out,

So if you ever need help and dont worry i dont care how newbie the question is i will try to help
because i always get asked how to make a private server so ill help you just add my msn:

zandiacorp@hotmail.com
or email me at:
admin@zandiacorp.com or ramon@zandiacorp.com

Thanks im glad to be back.

Please do not flame this, i understand some might think it is spam but the purpose of
this is to imform you that i have not ditched RealmScape and that it should be released soon
