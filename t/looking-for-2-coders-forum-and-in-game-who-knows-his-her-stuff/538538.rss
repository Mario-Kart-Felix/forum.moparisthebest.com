    <description>Me and Co-owner are looking for coder who is willing to start a RSPS that can be very successful! We are hoping to start fresh and even plan which base to use according to whats easier and well-known to you! We want to add many cool things for players to have fun not just the normal PK, PVM. We can sink money into server when needed and get forums going also. Coders will be given head admins for either forums or in-game. PM this application to me!
