    <title>Banned, and not even read appeal?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/banned-and-not-even-read-appeal/525365</link>
    <description>I know I will probably never get the account back but I still have like a 0.01% chance of getting it appealed. Why haven&#39;t they read the appeals yet, I submitted them on all the day&#39;s I received them.

Nope, but it’s unfair to the people who have been muted/banned unfairly which we have been seeing quite allot of since the release of rs07.<br>
Jagex’s bot banning technology doesn’t seem to be able to differentiate between a no-life and a bot very well.</p>

</aside>
<p>Seeing as he has 4 offences on his account, 3 which are inappropriate language, ima assume the first one is either macroing, buying/selling/sharing an account, exploiting a serious bug, or RWT, any other offences wouldn’t have cause a permanent ban yet on your account, and jagex doesn’t review macro offences, I heard they get pushed off to the bottom of the queue of reports that they have to view.</p>
<p>Edit - Didn’t see that he was blocking off another offence actually on the bottom, might’ve been another reason for the ban  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
