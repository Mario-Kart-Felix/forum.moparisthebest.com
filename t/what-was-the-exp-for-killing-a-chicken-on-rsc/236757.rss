    <description>What was the exp for killing a chicken on RSC?

I finally figured out the formula info. to make it close to normal as possible and I just wanted to know if anyone knew the exact EXP you get for killing a chicken in RSC so I could make my RSC private server as close to the real deal as possible!

I know in RS2 you get 12 EXP for killing a chicken, but in RS2 chickens are lv. 1 not lv. 3 like in RSC

Thanks for any info. you guys can provide on this.</description>

              <p>[quote=“ephemeral, post:16, topic:236757”]Zian: Okay, I will do that… You know there are four different skills (Attack, Defence, Strength and Hits), right?</p>
<p>You can get experience to all of these skills, or to two of them (at any given time). The different combinations are shown below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attack (3/4) and Hits (1/4)</li>
<li>Defence (3/4) and Hits (1/4)</li>
<li>Strength (3/4) and Hits (1/4)</li>
<li>Controlled: Attack (1/4), Defence (1/4), Strength (1/4) and Hits (1/4)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, as you can see, you need to divide by 4 to have the base-experience.</p>
<p>Take for instance the Chicken you were talking about…</p>
<p>Chicken is level 3, whereas the total experience will become “(3 * 2) + 20”, which equals to 26. Now I guess, 26 isn’t really what you expected, is it? But if you divide this number (26) by 4, you will have a base-experience of “6.5”.</p>
<p>Now you can apply the base-experience differently, depending on what you are training… The following are the only possabilities you have:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attack (19.5) and Hits (6.5)</li>
<li>Defence (19.5) and Hits (6.5)</li>
<li>Strength (19.5) and Hits (6.5)</li>
<li>Controlled: Attack (6.5), Defence (6.5), Strength (6.5) and Hits (6.5)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is all information I can give, I am afraid (as there really is no more), so I hope you can work it out from there. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, NOTE: You do only get experience after you have killed the NPC, not by every hit. I don’t know where you got that impression from, by reading my message. Now you know that, atleast.[/quote]<br>

<p>Explain to me how you get divide by 4? where did that come from? and no with my formula you do get 8 EXP when the chicken dies… are you suppose to get more EXP for each attack you do to it? because even with the unedited source I did not get EXP for each successful attack I only got EXP once the chicken had died.</p>

<p>Zian: Your formula is very redundant… Why do you use “getCombatLevel() * 0” anyway? This will always end up 0, so removing it would never make any difference.

<p>Yea sort of all ready figured out the formula, and how to make it give the EXP I wanted… that is why I asked how much EXP a chicken normally gave, that way I would have a low lv. monster to base the EXP off of. and most noob RSC players could even answer that question.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>In that case, then why did you even give out a formula in a few posts above this one?[/quote]</p>
<p>I gave it out so if others wanted the same RSC EXP rates they could use it, I realize my formula might not be 100% right but it is based off the idea you get 8 EXP for each chicken you kill. I have not had time to test the EXP rates with other monsters yet, so like I said I don’t know if my formula is 100% right.</p>

              <p>The exact formula for <em>any</em> NPC in RSC is the following (the formula I added to Geminus):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">(Comabat Level * 2) + 20</code></pre>
<p>And yes, for killing a Chicken, it is 19.5. I get that by using my formula aswell. Here is how to calculate it.</p>
<p>A Chicken is level 3, so the formula for a Chicken would be the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">(3 * 2) + 20</code></pre>
<p>If you know math, you can see that it will end up to 26 pretty fast. 26 is the total experience for a Chicken. But that also includes Hits. So what you have to do, is the following:</p>
<p>Hits = 26 / 4, which is 6.5.</p>
<p>There are two options for the other skills (Attack, Defence and Strength), namely, the skill, or controlled…</p>
<p>Controlled mode: The experience = 26 / 4, which is 6.5.<br>
The skill mode: The experience = (26 / 4) * 3, which is 19.5.</p>
<p>Also, don’t ask whether this formula is accurate, or not, because <em>it is</em> totally accurate (I did check against the real RSC when I developed Geminus).</p>
<p>Zian: Your formula is very redundant… Why do you use “getCombatLevel() * 0” anyway? This will always end up 0, so removing it would never make any difference. Also, if you only keep it at “10 * 0.8”, then it will always become 8. So really, I don’t see what is so good about this formula? It is everything but close to the real RSC-formula.</p>

<p>The reason you got 19 EXP and 20 EXP after getting 19 EXP is because you can get .5 EXP but it does not show .XXX EXP but it is possible to get EXP in the decimals.</p>

<p>Are you sure it was only 8? Can’t remember exactly, but I think it was 18.</p>

<p>If any one else wants to change their EXP rates to the exact match of RSC here is what you do.</p>
<p>Go to your server folder then search for “FightEvent.java” open FightEvent.java with notepad or notepad++</p>
<p>change to:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int exp = Formulae.roundUp(((opponent.getCombatLevel() * 0) + 10) * .8);</code></pre>

<p>I finally figured out the formula info. to make it close to normal as possible and I just wanted to know if anyone knew the exact EXP you get for killing a chicken in RSC so I could make my RSC private server as close to the real deal as possible!</p>
<p>I know in RS2 you get 12 EXP for killing a chicken, but in RS2 chickens are lv. 1 not lv. 3 like in RSC</p>
<p>Thanks for any info. you guys can provide on this.</p>
