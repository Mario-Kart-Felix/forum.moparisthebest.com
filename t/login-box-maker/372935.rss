    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/login-box-maker/372935</link>
    <description>Hello all, I was wondering If there was a log in box maker, or an easy way for when the login box appears its just clear, I know I can just try and figure out exactly where the login box is on the client and just try my best and copy paste background images into my Loginbox.png but its taking too long and I want to know if there is an easier way ?</description>
