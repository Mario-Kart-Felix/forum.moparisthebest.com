    <description>[center]Hello Mopars, Idk if you do anything with this release whatever.. but though if your starting to host Nrs3server v2, You may Fix These bugs/error&#39;s so it would be a Nice Server.[/center]

Some error&#39;s/Bugs :
when you kill monster the drops coming very very late. and the npc stays there for long time also..
