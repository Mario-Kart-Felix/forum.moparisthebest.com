    <title>ISO: Experienced Coder [Delta 317]</title>

    <description>Hello Mopar World,
My name is Cameron, and in the RSPS world, you will see me go by the name of Star. I was the owner/coder of a few servers (MopyreX, PerfectionX, Helped with Ritzscape, Etc). My reason for being here is simple. A few of my friends and I was thinking about the good old days playing the plain and simple RSPS. So I got to thinking that I would create an old Delta 317 server. What im searching for is this- An experienced coder who can be there when Im not, to help keep this server alive and well. If you are interested, reply to this post or contact me via skype at ctash18@yahoo.com Thank you and have a wonderful day!
