    <title>[PI] Making an item that holds items for more inventory space</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-making-an-item-that-holds-items-for-more-inventory-space/414385</link>
    <description>[code]2,147,483,647 (or 231-1) is the highest number that is possible to store in a 32-bit signed integer in the Java programming language. Consequently, this is the maximum amount of coins (and indeed any other stackable item) that can be stored in a stack.[/code]
So obviously, the players can hold 2,147,483,647 coins in there items and in there bank therefor they can have 4,294,967,294 coins. So basically, I&#39;m not going to be able to enlarge the stack. But I could make it to were you can have more stacks. So I want to make a bag, box or something that will let you access another bank interface were you can store items in it. Anyone have any ideas on where to start or how to do this? Thx (:</description>

Maybe add an exchange like some other servers. Exchange 1b into a ticket, and then you can store your tickets etc and exchange them back to coins or trade them on when you need to. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

I like this Idea, just add a NPC that exchanges them over out side the main bank,[/quote]<br>
That would suck if they found a way to dupe stuff though. I don’t think there’s any dupes on my server though.</p>
