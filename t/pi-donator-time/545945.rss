              <p>To extend on what matzie said:</p>
<p>You can use Java’s Calendar class to get the timestamp from when they donated, add X amount of time, and then save it to the player file or database or whatever.</p>
<p>And then you need to add a system that would run in the background, constantly checking the currently online players for when their “membership” runs out. If it does run out as they’re playing, you’ll have to account for that. You’ll also have to account for it running out when they’re logged off.</p>
<p>And matzie is right, donators are people who are giving you money to support the server. They are not paying for a good or service (however if they get one in return, that’s always cool). A donator title would be given to someone that was like “hey, here’s 5 dollars to keep the website up”.<br>
A member or premium member would make more sense, because you’re paying for the membership as a good.</p>

              <p>First add the code for the donator time, the have the command return the value that holds the “until time” - “now time”.</p>
<p>Donators are meant to support the server. They should not be stripped of their title over time.  I think you are thinking of a “premium” account service.</p>
<p>You should probably create a new Database or add a table to your existing one. You should decide on the variables to add to it.</p>
