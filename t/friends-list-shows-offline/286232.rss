    <title>Friends list shows Offline?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/friends-list-shows-offline/286232</link>
    <description>Well on my server it is a problem and I have had heaps of complaints about it and im not sure how to fix it.

If the player is offline it shows that they are offline, and if they are online it shows they are online. But they can still send messages.

Also if u send a message to an offline player it still sends it if they are offline or not.

And it never shows if they are online[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 30, 2009, 05:52:17 am[/size][hr]Please somebody.
