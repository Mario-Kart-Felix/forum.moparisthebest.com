              <p>Hey zibas2, If you want to create and run a server it’s best to do a little research into them…</p>
<p>First off to answer your question:</p>
<p>You need to make sure your server is running on your machine either local or vps.</p>
<p>Clients connect to servers through sockets in java basically a server sits on a computer and occupies a opened port (see port forwarding).</p>
<p>By opening a port and running the server on that port you are Listening for a connection but the client has to be told where in the world that server is listening at because you know there’s a ton of computers and stuff… (See ip addresses)</p>
<p>The client also needs to know what port to connect to ports separate network traffic on a computer (Because how is a email server supposed to understand you just killed graador and want your loot XD)</p>
<p>Now I’m terrible at explaining things and stuff so you should probably forget all that if you feel even a little confused lol. basically open the port and and make sure client and server ips match<br>
in addition to any other security uid or rsa keys then test the connection with a status checker.</p>
<p>Anyways you should do a little research or your server will surely fail creating and running a successful server is no easy task to begin with think about the different roles there are to play and which one you are best suited to.</p>
