    <description>In w60 in Ardy there were mass amounts of people spying on this one penguin, in which you could spy on it as many times as you wished too turn in for EXP. Jagex mods were all over it in 30mins. I forgot to take screenies of the mass amount of people. But if anybody has screenshots post them here.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>We have now assessed the players who have been banned for abusing a bug involving being able to spot a penguin infinitely rather than the usual once. For the next few hours we will be in the process of taking the appropriate action for each account. 
<p>They fall into three categories.</p>
<p>In the first category, 159 players have been permanently banned. These are players who have spotted a penguin at least 250 times and cashed in their points. Most had spotted significantly more than 250. Many had spotted several thousand penguins.<br>
When you bear in mind that you can only spot 50 penguins at once. This means the players had to click on a penguin 50 times go to Larry for lots of rewards, then go back to the penguin and click 50 times go to Larry etc etc. That’s not something you can possibly do by accident.<br>
All these people got enough penguin points to gain hundreds of thousands of xp points in hard to level skills. For several players it was millions of xp gained.<br>
This is an extremely flagrant abuse of rule 4.<br>
We are very aware that we have a lot of customers who play this game mostly to compete in the hiscore tables. Using bugs to gain this much xp is not fair for all the many honest players who compete for places in the hiscore table by putting in a lot of effort to get up their experience by playing legitimately.</p>
<p>In the second category there are a number of players who also knowingly abused the bug and deliberately gained extra rewards from it. The numbers of penguins caught and the number of times they cashed in their points at Larry is quite clearly more than an accident, but the advantaged gained was not obscene.<br>
These players received temporary bans for breaking rule 4</p>
<p>In the third category there are a number of accounts which we felt banning them was a little too harsh. They had all spotted several more penguins than normal. Contrary to what some people have claimed we didn’t ban anyone who spotted very small numbers extra, but we feel we should have set the number even higher as on further review there are a number of users banned who we don’t think were deliberately trying to break the rules.<br>
Nearly all of the those accounts were unbanned on Friday night, which is only two or three hours after they were initially banned, so hopefully it didn’t inconvenience to many people. We apologise to any of these people who did lose playtime as a result. We are giving some free membership credit to those users.</p>
<p>A number of people have suggested a roll back of XP. While we can certainly see the merits of this idea, it’s unfortunately not technically possible at this time</p>
<p>I would remind all players that making use of bugs to gain an advantage in the game is against the rules and not fair on other players. For Jagex’s part we should try as hard as we can not to let these issues arise in the first place, and we have learned from this, but when we have a game as in depth and as complicated as Runescape, even with many people testing changes, it’s unfortunately impossible to guarantee that the game will be completely bug free.</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone that has brought this bug to our attention and thanks to everyone who withstood the temptation to abuse this bug – you are the kind of player that makes the RuneScape community so special</p>

<p>Haha, I bet there will be some crying children tonight.</p>
