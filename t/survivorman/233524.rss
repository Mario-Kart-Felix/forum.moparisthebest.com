    <title>Survivorman</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/survivorman/233524</link>
    <description>It&#39;s a tv &quot;survival&quot; show.  It&#39;s about a guy who goes into different locations to survive there for 7 days.  He brings no food, and there is no tv crew to film him.  He films himself, and has to use different techniques to survive.  Usually he is given just a few things, things that you may have with you if you were ever stranded.  I took a recent interest in this series, do to the fact that a guy I know went on the show with Les, to film an episode of the show.  From that I was given Season Two of the series and have discovered it is a pretty good, worth-while show.  Has anyone seen/heard of it?</description>

<p>That was about bear grylls Surviorman is awesome. And Dragon man vs wild is mostly unrealistic to the average person since he does things that most no one in that situation could be able to do however les stroud breaks it down to even where he acted out scenarios like his arm being in a splint.</p>

              <blockquote>Born Survivor featured British adventurer Bear Grylls dealing with "perilous situations" in the wild.
<p>But a crew member told the Sunday Times some nights were spent in hotels.</p>
<p>Channel 4 insisted Grylls was never billed as working entirely unaided, but promised to raise the matter with the production company that made the show.</p>
<p>American survival consultant Mark Weinert, who was recruited by Diverse Productions, told the paper Grylls claimed to be stranded on a desert island on one occasion.</p>
<p>He often directly addresses the production team, including the cameraman, making it clear he is receiving an element of back-up<br>
Channel 4 statement<br>
However, he was actually in Hawaii and spent some of his time there in a motel, Mr Weinert alleged.</p>
<p>Another time, he added, Grylls was filmed building a raft by himself, whereas the crew had actually put it together and dismantled it beforehand, to ensure that it worked.</p>
<p>And in a further episode, supposedly “wild” horses rounded up by Grylls had come from a local trekking facility, he claimed.</p>
<p>Further investigation</p>
<p>Channel 4 said in a statement that Born Survivor was “not an observational documentary series, but a ‘how-to’ guide to basic survival techniques in extreme environments”.</p>
<p>"The programme explicitly does not claim that presenter Bear Grylls’ experience is one of unaided solo survival.</p>
<p>“For example, he often directly addresses the production team, including the cameraman, making it clear he is receiving an element of back-up.”</p>
<p>The broadcaster said Grylls carried out his own stunts and did place himself in perilous situations, “though he does so within clearly-observed health and safety guidelines required on productions of this kind”.</p>
<p>“However, we take any allegations of misleading our audiences seriously and will be looking into this further with Diverse over the next few days.”</p>
<p>The series was originally made for the Discovery Channel in the US and was acquired for UK transmission by Channel 4.</p>
<p>Diverse Productions declined to elaborate on Channel 4’s statement, while Grylls’s agent was unavailable for comment.</p>

              <p>It’s a tv “survival” show.  It’s about a guy who goes into different locations to survive there for 7 days.  He brings no food, and there is no tv crew to film him.  He films himself, and has to use different techniques to survive.  Usually he is given just a few things, things that you may have with you if you were ever stranded.  I took a recent interest in this series, do to the fact that a guy I know went on the show with Les, to film an episode of the show.  From that I was given Season Two of the series and have discovered it is a pretty good, worth-while show.  Has anyone seen/heard of it?</p>
