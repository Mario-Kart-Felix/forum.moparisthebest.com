    <description>My server is currently running on Rune-Evo V3 and my client is Foxtrot 718. I am currently portforwarded to 43595 and it is correctly set up, I used canyouseeme.org to test it and it worked. The ip on the loader.java and configuration.java is set to my no-ip address for my public client, but when I try to run it on another computer it gives me the following error,

Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: client : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0
        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source)

        at Loader.doFrame(Loader.java:52)
        at Loader.main(Loader.java:36)
Press any key to continue . . .

When I have the ip set for 127.0.0.1 it works just fine for me but no one else. What do I do? I&#39;m sure someone has a solution.</description>

              <p>My server is currently running on Rune-Evo V3 and my client is Foxtrot 718. I am currently portforwarded to 43595 and it is correctly set up, I used <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> to test it and it worked. The ip on the loader.java and configuration.java is set to my no-ip address for my public client, but when I try to run it on another computer it gives me the following error,</p>
<p>Exception in thread “main” java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: client : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0<br>

Press any key to continue . . .</p>
<p>When I have the ip set for 127.0.0.1 it works just fine for me but no one else. What do I do? I’m sure someone has a solution.</p>
