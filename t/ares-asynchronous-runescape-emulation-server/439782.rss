[size=16pt]About the Author[/size]
I&#39;ve been on MoparScape since late 2006, and being here is what inspired my desire for programming. I have been programming in Java for just over 5 years, and am making a career out of it.

[size=16pt]About the Project[/size]
Since I became a semi-competent Java programmer, I have wanted to create a RuneScape Emulation Server. Unfortunately when I became frusturated, I deleted all of the code I had written, waited a day, and started again. This has resulted in a large portion of my time rewriting code that I had already written. I believe the cause of this was that I was spending [b]all[/b] of my available free time working on it. This is going to be a side project of mine, for your benefit.

It is licensed under the GNU GPLv3, so you may include it in your own applications, as long as you conform with the license.

[size=16pt]Goals[/size]
Asynchronous
Event-driven
Modular
Easy to maintain
Simple to use

[size=16pt]Media[/size]
I don&#39;t have any media right now, but I will post them as soon as possible.

<p>The region system is definitely going to be one of the more difficult parts of the project. Conceptually its pretty simple. Regions have lists of Entities (players, npcs, ground items, etc ) which all extend observable. Let’s say a player teleports out of the region. It notifies its Region object about the change, which then forwards the change to the other entities in the region. Ill try to explain it better later tonight, as im typing.on my phone at the moment[/quote]</p>
<p>You wouldn’t even have to go as far as that. Id suggest anonymously registering an entity to a region and then having a time where their position is updated. Ill withdraw for a bit to see how the observer model will suit you. From an efficiency standpoint, I see it as an issue. You would want the entities not to be relative to each other but rather relative to the world.</p>

<p>Be very careful with how you model your region system. I’ll wait to see what you create. YOLO: Less OOP is good.</p>
