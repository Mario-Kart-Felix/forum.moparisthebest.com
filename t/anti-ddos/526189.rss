<p>From what I know, if you get a VPS you can get a program called hotspot shield and It is a free system. It encrypts you connection and changes your IP so if you were to get ddoséd you would not, which also means if your no-ip got pinged it would give you the ddoser the ip which was assigned to you by hotspot shield.</p>
<p>please correct me if i am wrong, but this is how i think it works. And it think this is a good anti ddos strategy?[/quote]<br>
That’s a terrible strategy. I don’t know why everyone thinks IP addresses are somehow the magical key to ddos protection. If you change your IP address your hostname needs to point to the new address otherwise your users can’t connect. And if the hostname points to the new IP address then the attacker already has it.</p>

<p>TBH its near impossible to fully protect yourself from DDoS. Using software to “protect” yourself still requires CPU time and bandwidth, even if all the software does is detect an attack and drop the packets, it still has to detect the attack, and drop the packets, in other words the DDoS still reaches your server. If you want to protect yourself as best as possible, I’d look into using cloudflare, but that’s not free.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Afaik cloudflare is just a web CDN, so great for websites but not something you’d use for an RS server. You’re correct in the sense that it’s not possible to fully protect yourself, because the whole idea behind an attack is that the packets look that that of legit users. The only way to defend yourself is to buy more servers, buy better hardware, or use some software/hardware that drops bad packets before they reach any bottlenecks. But this is much harder when the attack is very distributed and the attackers behave almost exactly like real users.</p>
