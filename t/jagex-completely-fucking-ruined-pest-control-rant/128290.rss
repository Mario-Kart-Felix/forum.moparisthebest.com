    <description>Yeah, here&#39;s my little rant.

Ok, let me give you some little numbers to fiddle with, back when we had the old system, at level 80, if you got a point, you would get 1.3k or so xp, so, I spent 10 minutes allocating my 68 points to magic, at this point I&#39;m 35k from 81 magic. During the old system, I could complete a game in 1 minute, do the maths, that&#39;s 130k xp in 1 hour 40 minutes, plus the 30k~ you&#39;ll get during game, almost 160k in 1 hour 40 minutes. Anyway, after getting the points, and spend 20 minutes looking for a 90+ world, and almost 3 hours over the course of 4 days during the game, I was fucking HORRIFIED to find out, 320 fucking xp on a level 80 skill.

Conclusion: 62k xp in 3 hours.

Edit: Reason why I made this thread: Completely fucking wasted 1.4k shots from a 900k crystal bow, 200k for repairing barrows. I was expecting fucking 81 mage, went out my way to get it, if I fucking knew I was going to spend 1.1m for 62k xp, I would have bought 11k iron ore and got 838k smithing xp, at LEAST 225k range xp and a shit load of runes from drops to get my magic up by 100k xp.</description>

              <p>Well, in Pest Control, you get normal HP exp. Its like training at rock crabs.</p>
<p>Then, once you spend those 100 tickets, thats anywhere from 70k-100k+ EXP, with 0 hp exp involved. after about 1.5M exp, 1M from the points alone, thats really effecting someones HP. My old main from before PC, whip’s and dragon scimmies is 82 hp at 96 combat, whilst normal is 76-79.</p>

Note, you need to get 3.5x more tickets to get the same xp as before, so even on the 100+ level you still won’t get the same amount of xp unless you have 25 people who can do the trip in 1 minute, but you can’t because of the shields.</p>

              <p>It was to easy in the first place, seriously before pest control i think the leveling was just right.<br>
Think about it, its risk free easy fast exp. (was), now they slowed it down.<br>
I would not of complained if they removed it completely.</p>

              <p>Yeah, here’s my little rant.</p>
<p>Ok, let me give you some little numbers to fiddle with, back when we had the old system, at level 80, if you got a point, you would get 1.3k or so xp, so, I spent 10 minutes allocating my 68 points to magic, at this point I’m 35k from 81 magic. During the old system, I could complete a game in 1 minute, do the maths, that’s 130k xp in 1 hour 40 minutes, plus the 30k~ you’ll get during game, almost 160k in 1 hour 40 minutes. Anyway, after getting the points, and spend 20 minutes looking for a 90+ world, and almost 3 hours over the course of 4 days during the game, I was fucking HORRIFIED to find out, 320 fucking xp on a level 80 skill.</p>
<p>Conclusion: 62k xp in 3 hours.</p>
<p>Edit: Reason why I made this thread: Completely fucking wasted 1.4k shots from a 900k crystal bow, 200k for repairing barrows. I was expecting fucking 81 mage, went out my way to get it, if I fucking knew I was going to spend 1.1m for 62k xp, I would have bought 11k iron ore and got 838k smithing xp, at LEAST 225k range xp and a shit load of runes from drops to get my magic up by 100k xp.</p>
