    <title>Some more questions lol</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-more-questions-lol/278857</link>
    <description>I use search just so you guys know (ive done alot on my server this morning lol..)

I have a few questions
Basic question (i guess?)
I need to add a item to my server (its a null but i know its supported)
how do i add items to my server (im trying to add bandos gs, and it comes out null whenever dropped)

a little harder question:
I am trying to make 3d models, but whenever i try to find the items (do export new cache) it doesnt work
it says &quot;cannot find main class: cacheexport2.Main. Program will exit&quot; how do i make it find it? (i tried edit to find the path, but it didnt even have one i dont think (it didnt make sense)

Sorry to bug you guys over and over, im just trying to get better at this

and yes i do use search or else id of asked like 25 questions this morning :P</description>

<p>If your trying to make models this is not the correct section to be asking about them</p>
