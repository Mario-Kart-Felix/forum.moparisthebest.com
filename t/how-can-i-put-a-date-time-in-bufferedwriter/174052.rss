    <description>Can someone please help me, this is something i&#39;ve been trying to figure out for a long time... Please

I just need to put a time in thise strip.

[code]         	bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;logs/commands.txt&quot;, true));
	bw.write(playerName+&quot; has used tempban on &quot; +bannedUser.playerName);[/code]
