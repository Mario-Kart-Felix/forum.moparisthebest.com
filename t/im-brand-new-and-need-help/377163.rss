    <title>I&#39;m Brand New and Need Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-brand-new-and-need-help/377163</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m new to this rsps stuff and would be glad if I could be helped. Could someone please tell me what I did wrong or haven&#39;t done yet, that would be alot of help. Thank you

I got my source and it is:
Client: http://www.mediafire.com/?yyylojjbwzw

Server: http://www.mediafire.com/?dwmtykml2xl

After that I created my no-ip account and created a host. 
Then I changed my Environmental Values to:

CLASSPATH  -  CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin;%CLASSPATH%;
PATH  -  C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin;

Once I finished that I started Port Forwarding and I hope I did it correctly

Then I went into the client folder and looked for gui.java
Hit ctrl+F and searched serverip
Changed the ip to mine
And saved and compiled

After that I tried to login and says server error. Any help please?</description>
