    <title>A carpet ban?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-carpet-ban/547339</link>
    <description>Is anyone familiar with this term? It is some sort of ban for the RSPS I play. I haven&#39;t been able to find anything else about it on other gaming forums</description>

My guess would be it either means an IP ban or a ban that is given to a bunch of people for breaking a specific rule. For example, if someone is creating a bunch of accounts to do something, they might “carpet ban” all of them with a set of IP bans. Or if there are a bunch of people abusing a glitch and they managed to trace people that did, they might “carpet ban” all of those accounts.<br>

Or they could quietly ban you and sweep your mangled corpse under the carpet and act like it didn’t happen. :rolleyes:[/quote]<br>
I like this answer lmao.</p>
