    <title>More strict enforcement of rules</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/more-strict-enforcement-of-rules/19639</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve visiting moparisthebest.com a little bit more lately and have noticed that the members over there either ignore or just plain out disobey the rules of the forum. I had told a few people that they were breaking the rules and they apologize then break the same rule right away again. I understand that moderators can&#39;t be on 24/7 but maybe if the rules were more strictly enforced there would be less rule breaking?</description>

<p>This is everyone’s suggestion, but in the long run, it does not work as previously thought. What you need is moderators that are up to par with the demands of the Forum, perhaps there should be more moderators, I don’t know. But the increase of moderators only breeds trouble. Elitism is something this forum seems to dabble in quite a bit. Dedication, trust &amp; respect are the traits a good moderator needs. Unfortunately for most forums, they lack members who have inherited said traits. A rare breed indeed.<br>

I’m going to ignore all this shit and get straight to the point. Fuck the upper-class. Fuck them! Let’s put all our trust in with the proles, and the lurkers. Why, you may ask? Well, look here we have too many elitists, bigots and self-centred people in the upper-class of this website. Take Regex for example; he’s just fucking lame! Now, you may all think that the lower class peasants of this society are uneducated, and pretty much lost. WELL, that’s not true! If it wasn’t for them, you would not be free! IT WAS THESE DARN PEOPLE THAT SAVED YOUR ASSES IN THE CIVIL WAR OF <a href="http://RSNOOBS.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">RSNOOBS.NET</a>, AND FUCKING DEFEATED THE FASCIST GOD (WELL, HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF A GOD AT THE TIME) MOPARISTHEBEST. FOR YEARS, MAYBE EVEN MINUTES THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING, IT WAS AS IF I WAS IN HEAVEN. THE PROLES AND THE UPPER CLASS WORKING TOGETHER. AN AMAZING SIGHT IT WAS. Sorry, I’ll stop typing in caps. Later that day, Moparisthebest’s brother (Max, or just Mopes) took over the site, and redirected it here, to <a href="http://moparisthebst.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebst.com</a>. Now everyone of you here are all victims. You have all been brainwashed, and there is not a darn thing I can do, except say <span class="bbcode-b">FIGHT MOPAR, START A CIVIL WAR</span>.<br>

<p>Uhh, no Mopar = fresh food for all. We could live of Mopar’s fat, pig-like body for years (all of us) and after those years come 'round, we’ll simply kill the fattest man (RegeX), etc. The cycle will work.<br>
[/quote] But who will update the site? Surely the other admins will take mopar’s place, and keep enforcing his rules, re-enforcing them, and, of course, continue his work. And you can’t kill the admins, because they are the only ones with the pwoer to update the forum, add boards, etc. Plus the meat would spoil after a few weeks…</p>
<p>So I’m on mopars side.[/quote]</p>
<p>Don’t waste your time with him. Gorlackgoo is regex, it’s quite obvious after reading through his posts.</p>

Now, you may all think that the lower class peasants of this society are uneducated, and pretty much lost. WELL, that’s not true! If it wasn’t for them, you would not be free! IT WAS THESE DARN PEOPLE THAT SAVED YOUR ASSES IN THE CIVIL WAR OF <a href="http://RSNOOBS.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">RSNOOBS.NET</a>, AND FUCKING DEFEATED THE FASCIST GOD (WELL, HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF A GOD AT THE TIME) MOPARISTHEBEST. FOR YEARS, MAYBE EVEN MINUTES THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING, IT WAS AS IF I WAS IN HEAVEN. THE PROLES AND THE UPPER CLASS WORKING TOGETHER. AN AMAZING SIGHT IT WAS. Sorry, I’ll stop typing in caps. Later that day, Moparisthebest’s brother (Max, or just Mopes) took over the site, and redirected it here, to <a href="http://moparisthebst.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebst.com</a>. Now everyone of you here are all victims. You have all been brainwashed, and there is not a darn thing I can do, except say <span class="bbcode-b">FIGHT MOPAR, START A CIVIL WAR</span>.[/quote] [brainwashedzombie]Most defend moparisthebest… must stop civil war… must stop Gorlackgoo… must take him to mopar for brainwashing…[/brainwashedzombie][br][size=1]Posted at: November 22, 2006, 08:58:14 PM[/size][hr][quote=“Gorlackgoo, post:24, topic:19639”][quote author=bumblescum link=topic=29818.msg422400#msg422400 date=1163007789]</p>

<p>Haha, yes, you’ve made this claim; but how will we achieve said happiness? Surely you have some strategy for survival?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Uhh, no Mopar = fresh food for all. We could live of Mopar’s fat, pig-like body for years (all of us) and after those years come 'round, we’ll simply kill the fattest man (RegeX), etc. The cycle will work.[/quote] But who will update the site? Surely the other admins will take mopar’s place, and keep enforcing his rules, re-enforcing them, and, of course, continue his work. And you can’t kill the admins, because they are the only ones with the pwoer to update the forum, add boards, etc. Plus the meat would spoil after a few weeks…</p>
<p>So I’m on mopars side.</p>
