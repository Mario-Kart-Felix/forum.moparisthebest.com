    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Envizions has announced an &quot;open source hybrid Linux gaming system&quot; aimed at game developers. The EVO Smart Console is based on a 2.9GHz, 64-bit Athlon, includes its own Linux distro called Mirrors Evolution, and offers game-play, Internet access, VoIP, and HD video playback, Envizions says.

Marketed with the 1950&#39;s-era tag line of the &quot;System of Tomorrow,&quot; the EVO Smart Console will sell for as little as $250 with rebates. It will offer &quot;cloud&quot; based computing applications, Amiga-based games, and an Akimbo-based VOD (video on demand) service with over 10,000 titles, says Alabama-based Envisions Computer Entertainment Corp.

Additional EVO Smart Console features include remote access, voice recognition, DVR, Internet television, HD video, social networking, streaming content, VoIP, and automatic backup storage, says the company. A virtualization capability is said to support running an authorized copy of Windows alongside Linux. In fact for $100 extra, the company will pre-install Windows on the Linux computer.........&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>I find that more and more companies/groups of people are buying into this open source sales scheme. Open Source may be the way of the future, but I just don’t think it should apply to gaming. If this does have some success, just imagine 100’s of games that are carbon copies of each other, just different dialogue, story, etc. Almost like any person who wants to make their own game can leech the source code and use it for their own game, just change the name and ship. Like a more widely used MoparScape server, I just am afraid to see that happen.</p>
