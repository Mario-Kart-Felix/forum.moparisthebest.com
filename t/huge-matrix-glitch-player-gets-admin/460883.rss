    <title>HUGE MATRIX GLITCH [Player gets Admin]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/huge-matrix-glitch-player-gets-admin/460883</link>
    <description>Today,
Someone said, why didn&#39;t i receive my donator, i donated 40$??!
I replied, to who did you donate? He said to &#39;Elite&#39;. (Me and my friend are the only owners) He said he had a crown.
I didn&#39;t believe him, later that day, someone named Elite joined my server, he had a Blue Partyhat and a firecape, on a eco server, but wait.. he was a Admin!? WHAT??? Yes, he got admin on a unknown way, he claimed to be Dragonkk, and he was the one scamming the guy who donated 40$, 

FOR PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T LIKE TO READ:
~Someone claimed he donated 40$ to Elite (a admin who i don&#39;t know), but didn&#39;t get his donor rank.
~Later that day i saw him on my Server
~He claimed to be Dragonkk, he is also a admin on my server. (Not anymore tough)


Basicly my question is, there is a glitch that makes a play er a admin, a command or something, i checked at commands.java, didn&#39;t find anything, but ok. He left.

Did someone find the glitch?
Could it be client sided?

Thanks,
Impactz
