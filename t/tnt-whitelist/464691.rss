    <title>TNT whitelist</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tnt-whitelist/464691</link>
    <description>It need&#39;s sorting. Nobody with the power to add to the whitelist is doing anything about the applications.. People who have applied are asking &quot;will I get TNT access&quot; or &quot;when will someone read my application and reply&quot; and I&#39;m forced to reply with &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. That makes me look lazy and stupid and also the rest of the staff team. Either someone needs to start accepting or denying the application or remove the white list all together.

On the subject of removing the whitelist I know the first thing that comes to mind is people are just going to greif with it.. That&#39;s true, they could, but we can rollback damage? Plus if your worried about people searching for diamonds using TNT, I say let them. The time it takes to get enough gunpowder to blow up a hole big enough to find diamonds or other ores would be equal to the outcome of strip mining or mining in a cave. TNT mining also adds the risk of blowing up the ores you may find.</description>

              <p>That’s sort of the idea, they ask to be considered by posting in that topic, and then the moderators effectively post their opinions via a topic here for example, at which point an admin either accepts or declines it. In the past, the suggestions board was going to be used for them to apply themselves, and then staff could discuss it there but we’ve had to disable that due to a few bugs (for now).</p>
<p>There is a link to MITBs script which shows information about them, but to be honest, for a lot of the apps it’s sort of irrelevant.</p>

              <p>I agree the whitelist hasn’t been working well, at all. I did want to change it a little in the past, but there are some restraints on how applications can work. Though, the original idea was that the moderators post a topic suggesting a person for TNT rights and then discuss it, and an administrator then accepts/declines it.</p>

              <p>I would have to agree with this for the most part. Getting gunpowder is hard to do. If people do grief with it, like Jamie said, we can roll it back now from what I’ve heard. I’ve also had the annoying moment of blowing up ores I wanted with tnt before <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  We could still keep the same rules, no using tnt to grief, or for pvp. No leaving big random ugly holes made from using tnt. etc.</p>
<p>Isn’t there a way to disable it for people after they prove that they don’t need it?</p>
