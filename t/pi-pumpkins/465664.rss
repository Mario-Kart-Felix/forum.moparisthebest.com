    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-pumpkins/465664</link>
    <description>So I made a halloween event, and the npc&#39;s dropped pumpkins. I decided today I wanted to edit it so you can basically smash the pumpkin(no need for animation), and it would turn into a halloween mask. But I don&#39;t really know the first place to start. 
I want to make it so there&#39;s an option to &quot;smash&quot; pumpkin along with &quot;use&quot; and &quot;drop&quot;
Could someone help me?</description>
