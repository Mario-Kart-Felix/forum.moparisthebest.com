<p>Arrays and enums are the same, so it’s a PERSONAL PREFERENCE, since an enum’s .values() method iterates through the objects as it would in a loop with an array, BUT with common sense you would not use an enum when defining 3 objects and them only having 1 value (int in this case), enum has a lot of great features and I’m all for using enums, but only when you would actually take advantage of the features.</p>

<p>Arrays and enums are the same, so it’s a PERSONAL PREFERENCE, since an enum’s .values() method iterates through the objects as it would in a loop with an array, BUT with common sense you would not use an enum when defining 3 objects and them only having 1 value (int in this case), enum has a lot of great features and I’m all for using enums, but only when you would actually take advantage of the features.<br>
