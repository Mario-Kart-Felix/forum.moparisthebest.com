    <description>Functionality of crackers for partyhat&#39;s has been added into our server, but on use of the cracker on another player it will eject the partyhat correctly but then it will flood the runserver prompt with null pointers. This then causes the server to disconnect. Here&#39;s a picture of the error&#39;s we&#39;re receiving, any help is greately appreciated. Project Insanity base.
