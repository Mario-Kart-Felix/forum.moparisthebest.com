    <title>Chat Window</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chat-window/322952</link>
    <description>I want to make a Chat.bat file for my server so whenever my server is on and I click Chat.bat, a separate window opens and all of the chat in game prints into that window so I can read it while I&#39;m not on the game, but I can close and reopen the box anytime I want to view the chat. I&#39;ve been looking at my run method and trying to figure out how the run method is connected to my run.bat which will run my server and I can&#39;t figure out how they connect to make it all work. I know how to make chat appear in my main server window, but I don&#39;t want it there because of all the extra stuff like when a player logs on and logs off, does a command, etc. How would I do this?</description>
