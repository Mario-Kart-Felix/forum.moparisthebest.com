    <title>Need help with running a PC case fun?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-running-a-pc-case-fun/550899</link>
    <description>I am going to build a &quot;cooling&quot; station for my PS3 that is 2.5cm - 1 inch high off the ground for air to pass through with an extra fan in the middle too cool it down a bit.

For the fan i am using a case fan from my old pc case that i replaced.

For the fan to run i am going to use this:

The red square is the where the fan is going to be mounted, Not yet sure how but i will find out. It&#39;s going to be exactly as it is shown in the model but close.

so If i plug in the fan into the PS3 is it going to run fine with that cable i showed above?</description>

It should run fine, I run fans off of usb and they work fine. USB Ports are normally 5 volts. If the fan is 12 volt it wont run full speed but it will still work. In my opinion I’d plug the fan directly into the wall with a 12 volt adapter. But the usb will work just not full speed.</p>
<p>Example, Most phone batteries are 3.5 volts. And it takes 5 volts to charge 3, But when you plugin a 12 volt fan into a 5 volt port it’ll still work but not at the right speed. How many volts is your fan?<br>

<p>I think it’s fine if it didn’t run at full speed , it would be kinda noisy and actually perfect at like half speed or less. But incase it ran too slowly i can try a 12v adapter, thank you very much for the help.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I just finished the frame where the ps3 will sit , just waiting for the usb to fan adapter to arrive.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well tbh I love your idea I might have to do something like it for my laptop. Overheats while watching netflix</p>
