    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wrong-place-need-people-for-development-team-p/302482</link>
    <description>Hi guys, currently, me and Epic Ancient are remaking RS from 2005. it will be EXACTLY like rs, no codes, a good economy, none of the bad updates.

So, this is a big task for two people, and so we need help.

Currently there is

0mg Noob
Epic Ancient
--Knova [kite] (Helping)--
-
-
There are two more spaces at the mo. You must have teamviewer,
The server base is Devolution 2.7

We are new [except kite] to devo so it would help alot if you had some experience to help us all.

If this is in wrong place please tell me  and possibly move it to right place.
We are aiming to get a development team going, to track updates and progress.

I willpost more info very soon.
Thanks! :-)</description>

<p>Alrighty then. I can get you all the autospawn with all runescape npcs back in 2005. But they wont have interfaces yet, so were gonna need to add them. [as in they wont talk to you, answer your questions, and such]</p>
