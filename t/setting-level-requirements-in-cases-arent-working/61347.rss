    <title>Setting Level Requirements in Cases arent working...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-level-requirements-in-cases-arent-working/61347</link>
    <description>Okay. Im making a new skill called Demolition. I wont explain it because I dont want it copied and released before I finish it and release it. Anyways, when I set a level requirement like this:
[code]if (playerLevel[22] &lt;= 50);[/code] I get no errors. Yet, it works and *Does the Demolition Thing* (Not posting what it does... Only friends know...) and sends both messages (What happens when you have the level and when you dont). I tried to do like
} else {, use } and {, and other things but you cant really use those in cases without errors cause it uses a break; to stop it. So I was wondering how to fix it  :). Thanks for all your help if you can!</description>
