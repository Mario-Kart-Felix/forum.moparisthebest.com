    <description>Okay, I may just get warned for this.
But this is getting so ANNOYING.



There are a few things everyone has to know.


One.
Flaming is bad people. Don&#39;t flame someone for asking something you may know, or is simple to solve.

Two.
Spamming is bad. People!! SERIOUSLY, you post something totally off-topic like eclipse says:

OK :)

When someone&#39;s asking for help.
I mean seriously it&#39;s annoying!

And three.
the 5-7 Posts in a row? Seriously, that can get annoying too, just because someone won&#39;t help you at first doesn&#39;t mean you need to keep bumping it. It just means you should wait, or PM Someone you KNOW Can help..


And that is all I have to say.
Yes I know I may be warned for this. But I really just wanted to state this.
Thanks.</description>
