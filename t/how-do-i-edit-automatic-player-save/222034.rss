    <title>How do I edit automatic player save?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-edit-automatic-player-save/222034</link>
    <description>Ok, so whenever someone goes on my server it laggs them out after a few seconds, I think it happens whenever there acount is being saved. So is there like anyway I can make it so it doesn&#39;t automaticaly save as often or somthing?

Thanks.</description>
