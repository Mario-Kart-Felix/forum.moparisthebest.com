    <description>Does anyone know how i can set my own dung room in a line?
Like just 4 rooms that  always going to the north (start room - npc room - second npc room - boss room).
a dwhen you killed th boss the dung entrance go open and you need killed all the npc first in the other rooms to go to the other room and you cant bring armour or items to the dung.

I hope someone knows how to this and wants to help me. :)</description>
