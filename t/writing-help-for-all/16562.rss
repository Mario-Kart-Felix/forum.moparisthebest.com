    <description>[center][size=13pt][b]Writing Help For All[/b][/size][/center]

[center][i]This thread is dedicated to helping people with writing. There will be help with writing stories &amp; essays, grammar, and more.[/i][/center]

[u][b]Stories[/b][/u]
You can write a story about anything you want. All you need are the basics. You wouldn&#39;t bake a cake without knowing the ingredients, right?

So before you write, it helps to know the ingredients of a story. That means you know what you want to write about.

Story Structure
It has a beginning, a middle and an end. Some stories even end up in the same place they started. It is like a snake that has its tail in its mouth, the head is the beginning, and the tail is the end.

For example, in The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy starts out in Kansas, travels to Oz in a cyclone and ends up back in Kansas.

Ready to start your story? Then grab a pencil and paper, or open up a new file on your computer, and away we go!

Main Character - The person, animal or thing your story is about
Every story starts with a main character. It can be any animal, human or anything else you want it to be. Make sure you focus mostly on the main character in the story, but add other characters to make the story more interesting.

Start by asking yourself some questions:
• Who or what is your main character?
• What does he, she or it like/dislike?
• What is your character&#39;s personality?
• What does your character look like?

When you start getting answers, you can write a brief description of your character. Describe his/her characteristics.

Example: Josh, a student, attends Benix High School in Urville, Newcountry. Althought he is shorter than most 15 year olds, he can win anyone in a arm wrestling match. He plays for the Benix Tigers, the school football team. Etcetera...

Setting - Where your story takes place
Every story needs to take place somewhere. Of course, you might say. But your story&#39;s setting can have either a big or little impact on the story. What would The Wizard of Oz be without Oz? Just a story about a girl and a dog in dusty old Kansas.

Ask yourself these questions:
• Where does your story take place - on the moon, in Hawaii, inside your dad&#39;s nose, or someplace completely different?
• When does your story take place: past, present or future?
• How much does your setting affect your main character&#39;s problem?

Problem/Conflict - The challenge your character must face and overcome
Without a problem, your story would be very boring. But when you give your main character a problem to solve, your story comes alive. Be sure to make it a big enough problem. In stories, the main character solves the problem, but then more problems come. This is called Complication.

Important tip: The more times your character tries and fails, the better.

Ask yourself these questions:
• What is your main character&#39;s problem?
• Is it a big enough problem that it will take a whole story to solve it?
• How does your main character try and fail to solve her or his problem?
 
Resolution - How the character finally solves the problem
The most satisfying resolutions come when you think your hero is about to give up. When they&#39;ve tried everything else, they finally solve the problem. It&#39;s best if your main character solves the problem on his or her own, but you can also use other characters to help the main character solve the problem.

*Remember to have fun and be creative. If your not having fun then make it fun.
*Be descriptive, and explain the most important parts of your story in good detail.
*Use adjectives, to express the characters.

[u][b]Essays[/b][/u]
Okay, first of all. The problem with most essays is that the content is disorganized. You may have great ideas and facts that you want to write about, but somewhere during the writing process you start mixing them up. Suddenly your perfect paper sounds all wrong and you want to scream!

What you need to do is have a good solid outline. Once you have an outline down, your paper writes itself. Your thoughts are organized and the teacher can understand your main point (which is your thesis) and how you supported that thesis. You need to be focused, and that is the key to writing a good essay.

This is a good outline format.

I. Topic / Title

II. Introduction of Essay
A. Grab the reader&#39;s attention. Then write a few sentences (2 or 3) that lead into the main point of your essay
B. End the paragraph with your thesis statement (3 main points you are going to support)
     1. First point in thesis
     2. Second point in thesis
     3. Third point in thesis

III. Body of Essay
A. First Paragraph - First point in Thesis
     1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence
     2. Have at least five sentences
B. Second Paragraph - Second point in Thesis
     1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence
     2. Have at least five sentences
C. Third Paragraph - Third Point in Thesis
     1. Support your point with either quotations or solid evidence
     2. Have at least five sentences

IV. Conclusion
A. Write a few sentences summarizing your essay
B. Restate your thesis and how you proved your point

Here are some other pointers.

Don&#39;t have run on sentences. Use commas and semicolons.

Don&#39;t use the same words again and again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some more help.

1.  Miscellaneous observations on a topic are not enough to make an accomplished academic essay. An essay should have an argument. It should answer a question or a few related questions (see 2 below). It should try to  prove something--develop a single &quot;thesis&quot; or a short set of closely related points--by reasoning and evidence, especially including apt examples and confirming citations from any particular text or sources your argument involves. Gathering such evidence normally entails some rereading of the text or sources with a question or provisional thesis in mind.
       
2. When--as is usually the case--an assigned topic does not provide you with a thesis ready-made, your first effort should be to formulate as exactly as possible the question(s) you will seek to answer in your essay. Next, develop by thinking, reading, and jotting a provisional thesis or hypothesis. Don&#39;t become prematurely committed to this first answer. Pursue it, but test it--even to the point of consciously asking yourself what might be said against it--and be ready to revise or qualify it as your work progresses. (Sometimes a suggestive possible title one discovers early can serve in the same way.)
       
3. There are many ways in which any particular argument may be well presented, but an essay&#39;s organization--how it begins, develops, and ends--should be designed to present your argument clearly and persuasively. (The order in which you discovered the parts of your argument is seldom an effective order for presenting it to a reader.)
       
4. Successful methods of composing an essay are various, but some practices of good writers are almost invariable:
       
* They start writing early, even before they think they are &quot;ready&quot; to write, because they use writing not simply to transcribe what they have already discovered but as a means of exploration and discovery.
* They don&#39;t try to write an essay from beginning to end, but rather write what seems readiest to be written, even if they&#39;re not sure whether or how it will fit in.
* Despite writing so freely, they keep the essay&#39;s overall purpose and organization in mind, amending them as drafting proceeds. Something like an &quot;outline&quot; constantly and consciously evolves, although it may never take any written form beyond scattered, sketchy reminders to oneself.
* They revise extensively. Rather than writing a single draft and then merely editing its sentences one by one, they attend to the whole essay and draft and redraft--rearranging the sequence of its larger parts, adding and deleting sections to take account of what they discover in the course of composition. Such revision often involves putting the essay aside for a few days, allowing the mind to work indirectly or subconsciously in the meantime and making it possible to see the work-in-progress more objectively when they return to it.
* Once they have a fairly complete and well-organized draft, they revise sentences, with special attention to transitions--that is, checking to be sure that a reader will be able to follow the sequences of ideas within sentences, from sentence to sentence, and from paragraph to paragraph. Two other important considerations in revising sentences are diction (exactness and aptness of words) and economy (the fewest words without loss of clear expression and full thought). Lastly, they proofread the final copy.

----------------------------------Following posted by Ron--------------------------------
Don&#39;t start sentences using the word But, or Because.

Don&#39;t use slang. (I failed an essay once in 7th grade when I did this.)

Use descriptive words. You probably don&#39;t read and have a poor vocabulary. That is very bad. You need to read and improve on that. No more... &quot;The fat guy fell into the pool&quot; type of setences. Use setences like &quot;The obese foolish man was not being cautious since he was so drunk, he lost his balance and fell right into the pool.&quot;

Here are some more Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts.

[u][b]Grammar[/b][/u]
We all make mistakes.

[b]A or An ?[/b] 

We use [b]a[/b] before singular count-nouns that begin with consonants (a bat, a dog, a lion); we use [b]an[/b] before singular count-nouns that begin with vowels or vowel-like sounds (an apple, an urban city, an open gate). Words that begin with an h sound often require an [b]a[/b] (as in [u]a[/u] horse, [u]a[/u] history book, [u]a[/u] hotel), but if an h-word begins with an actual vowel sound, use [b]an[/b] (as in [u]an[/u] hour, [u]an[/u] honor). Words beginning with [b]o[/b] and [b]u[/b] are sometimes a consonant sound. We sometimes use [b]a[/b] for words beginning with [b]o[/b] because sometimes the [b]o[/b] sounds like a [b]w[/b] ([u]a[/u] one-time deal); we sometimes use [b]a[/b] for words beginning with [b]u[/b] because the [b]o[/b] sometimes sounds like a [b]yoo[/b] sound ([u]a[/u] useful program)

Examples:
[u]A[/u] newspaper article was printed today.
[u]An[/u] eagle flew into the tree.

[b]Can or May?[/b]

[b]Can[/b] as an auxiliary verb means &quot;to be able to.&quot;

[b]May[/b] as an auxiliary verb means &quot;to be permitted to.&quot;

Example: 
Can we talk?
This is incorrect because you are able to talk.

May we talk? 
This is correct because you are asking if you are allowed to.


[b]Who or Whom[/b] - [url=http://web.ku.edu/~edit/whom.html]Link[/url] (Found by Ron)

She and I or She and Me? - &quot;She and I will go to the mall.&quot; Now if you took out &quot;She and &quot; then the sentence would read &quot;I will go to the mall&quot; so the sentence makes sense and so it&#39;s She and I. If you put in &quot;She and me will go to the mall&quot; and took out &quot;She and &quot; then the sentence would read &quot;me will go to the mall&quot; which just sounds retarded lol.

&quot;That guy hated her and me&quot; If you took out &quot;her and &quot; then the sentence would read &quot;That guy hated me&quot; which would make sense so it&#39;s Her and Me. I realize it&#39;s not she and me, cause that wouldn&#39;t sound right, but you get the point. If you had &quot;That guy hated her and I&quot; that wouldn&#39;t make sense and would be gramatically wrong because if you took out &quot;her and &quot; then the sentence would read &quot;That guy hated I&quot;.  Again, that would sound retarded!

[b]Use of Comma[/b]

1. Put a comma before a coordinating conjunction that separates two independent clauses.
2. Put a comma after introductory words, phrases, or clauses in a sentence.
3. Use commas to set off elements that interrupt or add information in a sentence. 

[u][b]Parts of Speech[/b][/u]

[b]Noun[/b]

A [b]noun[/b] is a [b]person[/b], [b]place[/b], [b]thing[/b], or [b]abstract idea[/b].

Examples:
Last [u]year[/u] our [u]neighbours[/u] bought a [u]dog[/u].
[u]Mr.White[/u] is a [u]teacher[/u].

[b]Pronoun[/b]

A [b]pronoun[/b] can replace a [b]noun [/b]or another [b]pronoun[/b]. Use pronouns so you don&#39;t have to keep repeating a noun. 

A [b]personal pronoun[/b] refers to a [b]specific person[/b] or [b]thing[/b]. 
A [b]subjective pronoun[/b] indicates that the pronoun is [b]acting [/b]as the [b]subject of the sentence[/b] (I, he, she, they).

Examples:
[u]It[/u] was that boy who stole my lunch.
[u]I[/u] was glad to find my friends.
[u]They[/u] are really smart.

[b]Verb[/b]

A [b]verb [/b]is a word which shows [b]action [/b]or [b]state of being[/b]. Every sentence must have a verb. Verbs tell if something has already happened, if it will happen later, or if it is happening now.

Examples:
He [u]ate[/u] the sandwich.
I [u]talked[/u] to my friends.
We started [u]walking[/u] to the store.

[b]Adverb[/b]

An [b]adverb [/b]can modify a [b]verb[/b], or an [b]adjective[/b]. It indicates manner, time, place, or cause; it usually tells us &quot;how,&quot; &quot;when,&quot; &quot;where,&quot; &quot;how much&quot; or &quot; to what extent.&quot; Most adverbs end with the &quot;ly&quot; suffix.

Examples:
I [u]quickly[/u] ran home.
Do it [u]now[/u].
He went home [u]twice[/u].
They [u]quickly[/u] ran to the store.

[b]Adjective[/b]

An [b]adjective [/b]modifies a [b]noun [/b]or a [b]pronoun [/b]by describing, identifying, or quantifying words. An adjective usually precedes the noun or the pronoun which it modifies.

Examples:
The small [u]balloon[/u] was held by the child.
The [u]beautiful[/u] waterfall was shown in a picture.
The [u]ravenous[/u] birds were up in the sky.

[b]Article[/b]

An [b]article[/b] is a member of a small class of determiners that identify a [b]noun[/b]. There are two types of article: [b]indefinite[/b] and [b]definite[/b]. There are only articles three articles in English: [b]a[/b], [b]a[/b] and [b]the[/b].

[b]Indefinite articles - a and an[/b]

[b]A[/b] and [b]an[/b] are the indefinite articles. They refer to something not specifically known to the person you are communicating with. Indefinite articles are used before nouns that introduce something or someone you have not mentioned before. They are also used when talking about your profession. Note - If the next word begins with a [b]consonant[/b] sound when we say it, for example, &quot;university&quot; then we use a. If the next word begins with a [b]vowel[/b] sound when we say it, for example &quot;hour&quot; then we use an.

Examples:
I saw [u]a[/u] dog this morning.
I ate [u]a[/u] orange for breakfast.
I am [u]an[/u] Engineer.
I am [u]a [/u] Spanish teacher.

[b]Definite Article - the[/b]

You use [b]the[/b] when you know that the listener knows or can work out what particular person/thing you are talking about; You should also use [b]the[/b] when you have already mentioned the thing you are talking about. [b]The[/b] is also used to say that a particular person or thing being mentioned is the best, most famous, etc. In this use, &#39;[b]the[/b]&#39; is usually given strong pronunciation.

Examples:
[u]The[/u] banana you ate was rotten.
Did you shut [u]the[/u] door?
She&#39;s got two children; a girl and a boy. [u]The[/u] girl&#39;s eight and [u]the[/u] boy&#39;s fourteen.
Harry&#39;s gym is [u]the[/u] place to go.
You don&#39;t mean you met [u]the[/u] Keira Knightly, do you?

[b]Preposition[/b]

[b]Prepositions[/b] are a class of words that indicate relationships between [b]nouns[/b], [b]pronouns[/b] and [b]other words[/b] in a sentence. Most often they come before a [b]noun[/b]. Prepositions are classified as [b]simple[/b]  or [b]compound[/b].

[b]Simple prepositions[/b] are single word prepositions - [b]across, after, at, before, between, by, during, from, in, into, of, on, to, under, with &amp; without[/b] are all single word prepositions.

Examples: 
The dog ran [u]across[/u] the lawn.
I am going to run [u]into[/u] the classroom.

[b]Compound prepositions[/b] are more than one word - [b]in between and because of[/b] - are prepositions made up of two words - [b]in front of, on behalf of[/b] - are prepositions made up of three words.

Examples:
The book is [u]in between[/u] [i]War and Peace[/i] and [i]The Lord of the Rings[/i].
The book is [u]in front of[/u] the clock.

The most [b]common prepositions[/b] are [b]&quot;about,&quot; &quot;above,&quot; &quot;across,&quot; &quot;after,&quot; &quot;against,&quot; &quot;along,&quot; &quot;among,&quot; &quot;around,&quot; &quot;at,&quot; &quot;before,&quot; &quot;behind,&quot; &quot;below,&quot; &quot;beneath,&quot; &quot;beside,&quot; &quot;between,&quot; &quot;beyond,&quot; &quot;but,&quot; &quot;by,&quot; &quot;despite,&quot; &quot;down,&quot; &quot;during,&quot; &quot;except,&quot; &quot;for,&quot; &quot;from,&quot; &quot;in,&quot; &quot;inside,&quot; &quot;into,&quot; &quot;like,&quot; &quot;near,&quot; &quot;of,&quot; &quot;off,&quot; &quot;on,&quot; &quot;onto,&quot; &quot;out,&quot; &quot;outside,&quot; &quot;over,&quot; &quot;past,&quot; &quot;since,&quot; &quot;through,&quot; &quot;throughout,&quot; &quot;till,&quot; &quot;to,&quot; &quot;toward,&quot; &quot;under,&quot; &quot;underneath,&quot; &quot;until,&quot; &quot;up,&quot; &quot;upon,&quot; &quot;with,&quot; &quot;within,&quot; and &quot;without.&quot;[/b]

Here is a helpful sentence that you can use to determine what is a preposition: [b]The mouse ran _____ the box[/b].

Example:
The mouse ran [u]into[/u] the box.
The mouse ran [u]past[/u] the box.

[b]Conjunction[/b]

A [b]conjunction[/b] is used to link words, phrases, and clauses. There are two types: [b]Coordinating[/b] conjunctions and [b]Correlative[/b] conjunctions.

[b]Coordinating Conjunctions[/b]

You use a [b]coordinating conjunction[/b] ([b]&quot;and,&quot; &quot;but,&quot; &quot;or,&quot; &quot;nor,&quot; &quot;for,&quot; &quot;so,&quot; or &quot;yet&quot;[/b]) to join individual words, phrases, and independent clauses. As a note remember that you can also use the conjunctions [b]&quot;but&quot;[/b] and [b]&quot;for&quot;[/b] as prepositions. To remember [b]coordinating[/b] conjunctions just remember [b]FANBOYS[/b].

[b]F - For
A - And
N - Nor
B - But
O - Or
Y - Yet
S - So[/b]

Examples:
Lilacs [u]and[/u] violets are usually purple.
Red [u]and[/u] blue are my favorite colors.
I would have went to town, [u]but[/u] I was in trouble.

[b]Correlative Conjunctions[/b]

[b]Correlative conjunctions[/b] always appear in pairs. You use them to link equivalent sentence elements. The most common correlative conjunctions are [b]&quot;both...and,&quot; &quot;either...or,&quot; &quot;neither...nor,&quot;, &quot;not only...but also,&quot; &quot;so...as,&quot; and &quot;whether...or.&quot;[/b] Technically, correlative conjunctions consist simply of a coordinating conjunction linked to an adjective or an adverb.

[u]Both[/u] my grandfather [u]and[/u] my father worked in the fields.
[u]Neither[/u] Mr.Frank [u]nor[/u] his brother knew where the book was.
The explosion destroyed [u]not only[/u] the school [u]but also[/u] the neighboring cafe.

[b]Interjection[/b]

An [b]interjection[/b] is a word added to a sentence to [b]convey emotion[/b]. You usually follow an [b]interjection[/b] with an [b]exclamation mark[/b]. As you can see below, it is really easy to find which word is a interjection.

[u]Ouch[/u], that hurts!
[u]Hey[/u]! Give that to me!

<p>Been busy with school…too much work. I’ll finish them today.[br][size=1]Posted at: December 10, 2006, 12:43:54 PM[/size][hr]<span class="bbcode-b">Infinitives</span></p>
<p>An <span class="bbcode-b">infinitive</span> is a verbal consisting of the word <span class="bbcode-b">to</span> plus a verb (in its simplest “stem” form) and functioning as a noun, adjective, or adverb. The term <span class="bbcode-b">verbal</span> indicates that an infinitive, like the other two kinds of verbals, is based on a verb and therefore expresses action or a state of being. However, the infinitive may function as a subject, direct object, subject complement, adjective, or adverb in a sentence. Although an infinitive is easy to locate because of the <span class="bbcode-b">to</span> + verb form, deciding what function it has in a sentence can sometimes be confusing.</p>
<p>Examples:<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">To smash</span> a spider.<br>
We intended to <span class="bbcode-u">leave early</span>.<br>
My greatest ambition is <span class="bbcode-u">to climb Mt. Everest</span>.</p>
<p>Be sure not to <span class="bbcode-b">confuse</span> an <span class="bbcode-b">infinitive</span>-a verbal consisting of to plus a verb-with a <span class="bbcode-b">prepositional phrase</span> beginning with <span class="bbcode-b">to</span>, which consists of <span class="bbcode-b">to</span> plus a noun or pronoun and any modifiers.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Infinitives</span>: to fly, to draw, to become, to enter, to stand, to catch, to belong</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Prepositional Phrases</span>: to him, to the committee, to my house, to the mountains, to us, to this address.</p>

<p>Yes, they do. I don’t think most people pay attention though, and this is just for a reference for people. I’m happy that you thought the essay part was helpful. I’ve been meaning to update, but haven’t had time. Probably will this weekend.</p>

              <p>Leader, right below Can or May make sure to put in…</p>
<p>Who or Whom - <a href="http://web.ku.edu/~edit/whom.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Link</a></p>
<p>She and I or She and Me? - “She and I will go to the mall.” Now if you took out "She and " then the sentence would read “I will go to the mall” so the sentence makes sense and so it’s She and I. If you put in “She and me will go to the mall” and took out "She and " then the sentence would read “me will go to the mall” which just sounds retarded lol.</p>
<p>“That guy hated her and me” If you took out "her and " then the sentence would read “That guy hated me” which would make sense so it’s Her and Me. I realize it’s not she and me, cause that wouldn’t sound right, but you get the point. If you had “That guy hated her and I” that wouldn’t make sense and would be gramatically wrong because if you took out "her and " then the sentence would read “That guy hated I”.  Again, that would sound retarded!</p>
<p>and for Parts of Speech you forgot Infinitives (to hate, to love, to eat, to jump are infinitives).</p>
