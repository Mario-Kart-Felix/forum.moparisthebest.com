    <title>FTB downtime</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ftb-downtime/520942</link>
    <description>I know it&#39;s down and all, but I&#39;m unable to do anything effective. I can&#39;t download/upload anything and it&#39;s been extremely laggy for me, unless Zuppers can sort something out I&#39;m going to have to retry again tomorrow. It started happening when I was in the middle of changing it around, so it&#39;s massively inconvenient and a pain to deal with for somebody else. Just had my third attempt to download something and it has ended in failure.</description>
