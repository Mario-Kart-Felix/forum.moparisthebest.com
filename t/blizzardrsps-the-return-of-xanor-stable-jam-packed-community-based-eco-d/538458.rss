[i]The return of Xanor![/i]
[b]An community-built server, for you and all! Feel free to pop in[/b]

[url=http://blizzardrsps.com]PLAY NOW![/url]

[b]Introduction[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]BlizzardRSPS[/b] was a server based 2012, full of crazy-ass features which never worked. But this 2013 return, has surely made me realize that there is more to a RuneScape Private Server, than it&#39;s features. You&#39;re more than unlikely to find unique features on 317 servers anymore, unless It&#39;s a new type of mini-game or event. But anyhow, we&#39;ve implemented many old features and new into a server, to create a whole new atmosphere, which I never knew existed. The server source is based on a source which is currently for sale, and although It&#39;s purchased, I&#39;m hoping to make community-progress with it, and through hopefully a new communities help, I&#39;ll be fixing any possible bugs, and implementing-community chosen features, because I feel the community&#39;s wants and taste is what is important.  I just hope you enjoy this exotic server, which may hopefully one day evolve into revolution and a new home to many RSPS veterans. I, as the owner of this server, hope I can help you through your stay and guide you through your journey, I respect all my players.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b][COLOR=GREEN]Other Information[/COLOR][/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;As of the moment, I&#39;m not accepting donations, as I&#39;d like to see for a little while how the server develops, as I do not want to be taking money on a server If I am unsure of It&#39;s future, I&#39;m hoping to continue the server, and if all goes well I&#39;ll pay monthly for this, with the community&#39;s help. The server fees are little, and we&#39;re running on a nice DDOS Protected VPS. Although donations are accepted, I tend to give away a few donor spots on odd occasions, so look out for that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
