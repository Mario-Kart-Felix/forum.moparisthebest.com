    <title>Redemption &lt;--Your new favorite RSPS--&gt;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/redemption-your-new-favorite-rsps/554998</link>
    <description>[SPOILER=Owner Prenote]I figured i would use this particular spoiler as a way to properly introduce myself to the community, I&#39;ve been programming in java
for roughly 4-5 years. My interest in programming sparked when I played my first RSPS (after finding out its possible to make one of my own). I have been pursuing building my own RSPS ever since, granted it has taken me quite some time, and the few people that will recognize the server would probably agree. Sorry for that guys, &lt;3. Much like the development of any piece of software its really been trial and error. However, Redemption is for the first time in a seemingly endless development process, is starting to function like the server that I had dreamed up when I originally started. Also, I would like to note that this is an open beta for the game. There is still a tremendous amount of content coming, so please bare with me :D [/SPOILER]
