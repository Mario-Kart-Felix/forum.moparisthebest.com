    <title>Cut the crap</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cut-the-crap/238329</link>
    <description>This isn&#39;t a site suggestion as it is more of a &quot;reminder&quot; to the people who bitch and whine about the site&#39;s staff and why it sucks. More particularly, the people who act like total faggots, and then whine about elitism being the cause of it. This site is what you make it, so if you want it to be good, contribute. This can be constructive criticism as long as it is [b]constructive[/b] (I bolded constructive, because &quot;l0o0o0ol DiS SuCkS Pp LiEk Ur mOM&quot; is not), and obviously, original content. This of course doesn&#39;t mean suck up to the noobs, you can of course criticize their work, as long as you provide a reason for it.* You see a flame? Ignore it. Someone flaming you? Take it to PM or ignore them completely, and let them get in trouble instead of you both. The staff aren&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s the fact that they have to deal with people who act like idiots and spam/flame.

From now on, you won&#39;t see any of that bullshit from me, and I hope everyone does the same. 

*P.S. Before you ask, I do most certainly believe that Tico&#39;s warnings in the GFX board were unjust. Yes the guy might be new and all, but was still acting like an arrogant prick after the people told him what to do [next or instead] and not to brag about his beginner-level work. This does not mean that I dislike Tico as GM, however I do believe he went a tad overboard with that.

Also, this is another message this topic is trying to convey:

When a thread—or in some cases an entire forum—becomes unstable the result is usually uncontrolled spam in the form of one-line complaints, image macros or rude behavior. When the discussion becomes heated and sides do nothing more than complain and not accept each other’s differences in point of view, the discussion degenerates into what is called a flame war. To flame someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion. Likely candidates for flame wars are usually religion, political or otherwise sensitive topics. Topics which degenerate are usually locked but when the problem is considered contagious they are deleted.</p>
<p>When a topic that has degenerated into a flame war is considered akin to that of the forum (be it a section or the entire board) spam and flames have a chance of spreading outside the topic and causing trouble, usually in the form of vandalism. Some forums (commonly game forums) have suffer from forum wide flame wars almost immediately after their conception, because of a pre-existing flame war element in the online community.</p>
<p>A flame war isn’t always associated or considered a breach of rules if troll or spam like behavior doesn’t accompany the usual rude replies or unsocial behavior. Since they can easily be passed as simply a “heated discussion” it is not uncommon for moderators to cast a blind eye upon them in the hope both parties exhaust each other in the one thread instead of spreading vandalism into others.<br>

When the discussion becomes heated and sides do nothing more than complain and not accept each other’s differences in point of view, the discussion degenerates into what is called a flame war. To flame someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion. Likely candidates for flame wars are usually religion, political or otherwise sensitive topics. Topics which degenerate are usually locked but when the problem is considered contagious they are deleted.</p>
<p>When a topic that has degenerated into a flame war is considered akin to that of the forum (be it a section or the entire board) spam and flames have a chance of spreading outside the topic and causing trouble, usually in the form of vandalism.

<p>A flame war isn’t always associated or considered a breach of rules if troll or spam like behavior doesn’t accompany the usual rude replies or unsocial behavior.
