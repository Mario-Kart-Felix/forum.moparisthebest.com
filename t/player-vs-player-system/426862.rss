    <description>Hi mopar, i&#39;m in the search of some help since i tried multiple sources and there&#39;s always something with the PVP fucked up. i would really want someone to come help me on teamviewer if it&#39;s possible. it&#39;s not for leaching since it&#39;s just for me n my irl friends, but the PVP system aint working since things just won&#39;t hit on eachother. please help, Reply here back and we can figure something out in PM :) 

thank you

-Matt

As stated above, redo the combat formula voids, e.g calculateMeleeMaxHit(), calculateMeleeAttack(), calculateMeleeDefence().</li>
</ul>

This isn’t the requests section. I’m not going to use T.V. to find a source for you. There’s always going to be a problem with PvP unless you can actually program.</p>

<p>That’s not what i said sir. i’m not in need of a new source, i got one. it’s just the pvp system so if someone could help me with the pvp system, just so we could hit on eachother. i would be gratefull. if someone could help me with that, i could learn it myself and there would be no more problems.[/quote]</p>
