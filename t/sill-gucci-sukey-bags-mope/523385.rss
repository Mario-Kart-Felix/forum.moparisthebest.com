By Wednesday morning, four thinks and three cars had been locked up. &quot;Essentially just what this is doing becomes society to take driving while intoxicated more seriously,&quot; said New York Gran Rudolph Giuliani.Not surprisingly, there are strong critics of this plan.

Colt blames the move on a rash of lawsuits towards gun makers that seek to recover the actual medical costs associated with treating gunshot victims. The West Hartford, Conn., organization faces 28 legal cases from cities along with counties blaming this for gun assault.In a letter for the distributors announcing it will no longer sell a lot of its products, Colt stated, &quot;We have had to face the tough reality of the effect our (legal)prices are having on our power to operate competitively.&quot; The move won&#39;t have much impact on the U.S. weapon market. While Colt has sold an estimated 30 million pistols and rifles considering that Samuel Colt first introduced their revolutionary revolving tube, the company lately has seen its market share decline. Production has gradually dropped since &#39;94. And in 1997, recent times records are available, Colt made less than 90,500 handguns, or just a bit above six percent of the country wide total. Industry colleagues said the company will probably reorganize and concentrate on establishing the so-called &quot;smart gun,&quot; which uses a radio sign to prevent unauthorized individuals from firing that. &quot;Colt has always been teetering on the side of bankruptcy. What we are seeing today is basically almost positioning on their own for the future.

If you do, Colt may be betting several taxpayer dollars at the same time. The smart rifle is far from being proven technologies - and Colt&#39;s capability to attract new government grants for women to fund its research may be the key to its long-term survival.  http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/michaelkorshandbags.html
