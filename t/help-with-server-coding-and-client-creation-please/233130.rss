    <title>Help with server coding and client creation please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-server-coding-and-client-creation-please/233130</link>
    <description>Hi I am new to both mopar and server coding and I need help with it. I have a source and I have done a few basic things but my server is noobish umm I heard most people that code for other people want to be paid for it and I can&#39;t really afford to pay a coder.I also need a client and don&#39;t know how to make one and can&#39;t afford to pay anyone to make one.
  If someone will code my server and/or help me make a client I will give co-owner to them.
Main things I want are godswords added to server and client along with some nice armour.
Also a few minigames added like godwars and pest control for more fun.Right now my server is a pk server and i don&#39;t like it lol you can pk anywhere but I like the source.If need be I will get a different source I just need a client and someone to code for me or theach me to code. :D So any help will be appreciated

  You can contact me at my msn, it is dull-boy@live.com or deathnotpain@yahoo.com.

Thanks for reading my post =]</description>
