              <p>well ill let you know what ive been learning is how to work with cfgs alot better l3etal3lade has been very patient with me on this but im going to try to incoperate some of what i learned into the new hybridscape because it really has some advantages also been working on making some of the other things alittle easier such as dialouge and stuff with finals and end of the quarter rush i got alittle off track but ive been playing around with a few things on silabscape and i hope to have a hybridscape beta ready for just us guys to see within 2 weeks</p>
