    <title>Looking for a particular client:</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-particular-client/2500</link>
    <description>I think regex made it, it was pretty funny.

Basically it would just yell out people&#39;s HP. If you were in the wildy, it would say something like: usernamegoeshere has 12/40 hp!

It was funny watching them say, &quot;How you do that?&quot;

Does anyone have this and willing to update it? lol[br][size=1]Posted at: May 06, 2006, 01:36:49 pm[/size][hr]No one has it? Damn :( Who wants to make me one ;) :D lol</description>
