There are MANY that doesn’t him personally, so it would be hard for us, like me, don’t get me wrong, I appreciate what he did for RSC, and his personality was quite intelligent (based upon his posts). Other than that, that’s all I knew about him, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>As far appreciating him in the RSC part, I suppose that’s how (in another way) of people appreciating him because that was what he gave his community.</p>
