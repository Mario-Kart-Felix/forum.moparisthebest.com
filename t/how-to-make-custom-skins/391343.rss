    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;SkinEdit

Latest download (Alpha 3 pre 7 fixed, 2011-04-13 / 13th of April 2011): http://solidfiles.com/d/27e8/

If you downloaded within 10 hours of the initial release please note that the included Launch.bat won&#39;t work, I accidently uploaded the wrong version. This is fixed in the above URL. The working batch file (for those who need it, most people won&#39;t need it) can be found here: http://solidfiles.com/d/0bf4/ (Put in the SkinEdit folder)

I&#39;m currently rewriting this post, please ignore everything below!

[img]http://h.imagehost.org/0110/latest.png[/img] [b]Alpha 3 pre 5[/b] [url=http://solidfiles.com/d/f1ee/]Download[/url] [url=http://www.moddb.com/games/minecraft/downloads/skinedit-alpha-3-pre-5]Mirror[/url]

SkinEdit is a simple graphics editor optimized for making Minecraft skins. It got many features to make it easier for beginners to understand how Minecraft skinning works as well as all the features even experienced skinners need. [b]With over 200&#39;000 downloads [/b]so far the latest alpha adds many requested features such as dodge and burn tool as well as flood fill.

[center]Got a [b]problem [/b]with SkinEdit?
Please read this post: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=4843&amp;start=1200#p2327609[/center]

[b]If the [u]previewer won&#39;t download or won&#39;t work[/u][/b], delete skintest2.jar and when it asks for the URL enter this:
[code]http://gf.web44.net/skinedit/skintest2.jar
or
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15956363/skintest2.jar[/code][list][list]

[img]http://j.imagehost.org/0693/installation.png[/img]

[ul][*]Make sure you have Java installed (if you can play Minecraft you have Java installed already)
[*]Download the file, preferably with the download button, but if you have problems use the mirror
[*]Open the compressed file (.zip). Your computer should be able to do this without external programs, but 7-zip and WinRAR can handle it as well.
[*]Put the files anywhere on your computer, but note that it will be a lot easier to get 3D preview working if you put it in a folder you have write access in (For example, under Windows &#39;My Document&#39; or &#39;Desktop&#39; works. You can put it in a sub-folder. Under Linux any folder under your home folder should work. Just make sure to get all files if you want to get the most out of SkinEdit (such as the &#39;backgrounds&#39; folder for additional backgrounds)
[*]Just doubleclick &#39;MCSkinEdit.jar&#39; (Might be displayed as &#39;MCSkinEdit&#39;). SkinEdit should now launch
[*]To get 3D preview working, just click ok when SkinEdit prompts you to enter the URL for the previewer. This is only done the first time you launch SkinEdit.[/ul]

SkinEdit is mostly tested under Windows 7, but should work in Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, newer versions of OSX and all graphical Linux versions (Tested on Ubuntu).

Here is a video tutorial by a friend of mine if you prefer video over text:

[b]This is normally not needed![/b]
Normally the 3D previewer gets downloaded automatically when you start SkinEdit the first time, but sometimes the downloader fails and then you need to install the previewer manually. This is usually the result of not being able to write to the current location. If you are experienced with your operating system you can launch SkinEdit as administrator which probably will allow it to download the previewer. This is only needed once. But, launching java programs with administrator status in Windows requires command prompt usage and therefore I will explain how to do it the easy way:

[ul][*]Right click on the following link and click &quot;Save As&quot; or &quot;Save Link As&quot; depending on what browser you use. [b]This might not work in Internet Explorer due to a flaw in it. In that case you have to use another browser.[/b] http://gf.web44.net/skinedit/skintest2.jar
[*]When you saved the file move it to the same place as MCSkinEdit.jar. Next time you launch SkinEdit it will find the file and you&#39;ll get 3D preview.[/ul]


[img]http://h.imagehost.org/0797/key_features.png[/img]

[ul][*]Easy to understand for a new skinner
[*]Notch skin previewer embedded and updated in real-time. Will show how your skin would look in-game (by default)
[*]It has the features you need the most. Burn and dodge for shading, flood fill and large brushes to paint large areas
[*]Fully functional undo and redo system
[*]PartPicker - A simple way of adding details to your skin![/ul]


[img]http://a.imagehost.org/0313/planned_features.png[/img]

[ul][*]Load a skin from a website
[*]Direct uploading to some imagehost as well as directly applying the skin (using Notch safe method for this)
[*]Better tool handling (added in pre 6)[/ul]


[img]http://h.imagehost.org/0710/known_bugs.png[/img]
Please note that only the bugs in the &#39;stable&#39; and &#39;recommended&#39; version gets listed.

[ul][*]The previewer won&#39;t work if you do not have a working Internet connection (alpha 2 - alpha 3 pre 4)
[*]The program appears to be looking for files in the working direcotry instead of the program directory which causes problems in Linux distros (and possibly OSX). This means that you&#39;ll need to put &quot;backgrounds/&quot; and &quot;parts/&quot; in your user folder instead of the program folder or launch SkinEdit from terminal with &quot;java -jar MCSkinEdit.jar&quot; if you are a advanced user.[/ul]

[b]Alpha 3 pre 6[/b] [img]http://h.imagehost.org/0314/unsupported.png[/img]
By downloading you agree that you won&#39;t upload this anywhere else, nor send it to anyone else without informing them about the rules they have to agree to (these rules). You also agree that you use this entirely at your own risk. This is newer than Alpha 3 pre 5 but it is not a finished version and therefore it is not marked as latest.

[img]http://h.imagehost.org/0110/latest.png[/img] = Latest version with all new features and bug fixes. Recommended for most users.
[img]http://j.imagehost.org/0918/stable.png[/img] = Stable and well tested version. Use if you want extra security and stability
[img]http://h.imagehost.org/0314/unsupported.png[/img] = You shouldn&#39;t use this. Not supported anymore. Download only if you have a good reason

[img]http://a.imagehost.org/0845/backgrounds.png[/img]
Since alpha 3 pre 4 you can add your own backgrounds and use. Some of the best backgrounds will be listed here for download!
For a background to work the width must be dividable by 64 and the height by 32.

[b]Mobs reskin pack (fixed)[/b] (by: Notch, Patrik Swedman)
Unfortunately you can&#39;t preview them property, but at least you can use SkinEdit for some of your re-skin needs. Includes both a gray scale and a color version of every mob image (except zombie, which is the same as the player skin) in the size 640x320. (The problem with the color ones not being scaled has been fixed)
[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?9hz7bwkcd0djq0x]Mirror[/url]

[b]Improved spider template[/b] (Based of Spider Background above, by: Quiteblank)
A better template for making spiders
[b]Download: [/b] [url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=YYS39ZSR]Megaupload[/url]

[b]EiETemplate[/b] (by: The Eie)
A alternative to the normal backgrounds. Best viewed with a bright background and with around 70% alpha. (Will be included in alpha 3 pre 5)
[url=http://j.imagehost.org/download/0846/eies_backgrounds]Mirror[/url]

[img]http://a.imagehost.org/0015/partpicker.png[/img]
PartPicker was introduced in alpha 3 pre 5 and is a way to easily add details to already existing skins, but if you&#39;re crazy enough you could create a entire skin with this feature. PartPicker simply lets you glue parts of a skin onto your own skin, such as glasses, a pair of jeans and why not your clan logo? 
To add a new part you simply put it in the &#39;parts&#39; folder. The file format must be .png and the size must be 64x32px. The area that isn&#39;t a part of the skin must be completely transparent (alpha 0).

To access PartPicker either go to Edit &gt; PartPicker or simply press CTRL + P.

[</em>]The program appears to be looking for files in the working direcotry instead of the program directory which causes problems in Linux distros (and possibly OSX). This means that you’ll need to put “backgrounds/” and “parts/” in your user folder instead of the program folder or launch SkinEdit from terminal with “java -jar MCSkinEdit.jar” if you are a advanced user.[/ul]</p>

By downloading you agree that you won’t upload this anywhere else, nor send it to anyone else without informing them about the rules they have to agree to (these rules). You also agree that you use this entirely at your own risk. This is newer than Alpha 3 pre 5 but it is not a finished version and therefore it is not marked as latest.<br>

Since alpha 3 pre 4 you can add your own backgrounds and use. Some of the best backgrounds will be listed here for download!<br>
For a background to work the width must be dividable by 64 and the height by 32.</p>

Unfortunately you can’t preview them property, but at least you can use SkinEdit for some of your re-skin needs. Includes both a gray scale and a color version of every mob image (except zombie, which is the same as the player skin) in the size 640x320. (The problem with the color ones not being scaled has been fixed)<br>

<p><img src="http://a.imagehost.org/0015/partpicker.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
PartPicker was introduced in alpha 3 pre 5 and is a way to easily add details to already existing skins, but if you’re crazy enough you could create a entire skin with this feature. PartPicker simply lets you glue parts of a skin onto your own skin, such as glasses, a pair of jeans and why not your clan logo?<br>
To add a new part you simply put it in the ‘parts’ folder. The file format must be .png and the size must be 64x32px. The area that isn’t a part of the skin must be completely transparent (alpha 0).</p>
<p>To access PartPicker either go to Edit &gt; PartPicker or simply press CTRL + P.</p>
