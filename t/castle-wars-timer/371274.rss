    <title>Castle wars timer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/castle-wars-timer/371274</link>
    <description>Okay, my internet was just off today, just got a new modem thing, and while it was off i figured i would code my own type of castle wars without any tutorial.

Well i got everything set up besides the part were they are in the waiting area, i can&#39;t get the coords figured out.

For example, when your trying to make a funpk area or something and you have to have the coords, if you dont know what i mean, heres the zammy team coords of my waiting area.

[code]public boolean isIncwzammy() {
	if((absX &gt;= 2428 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 2410 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 9532 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=9510))
	return true;
	else
	return false;
	}[/code]

If you could maybe tell me what im doing wrong? :o

would be loads of help, thanks!
