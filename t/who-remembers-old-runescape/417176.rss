              <p>Wow! I just read all of the replies to this thread. I’d have to say a lot of people liked the “old Rune|Scape” better than the modern one. Personally, “old” Rune|Scape is a matter of when you started playing (or a matter of opinion). I’d have to say that when I first started three years ago (almost four now) when I didn’t really know much about the game. My brother was the one that got me into R|S and then I found out that some of my friends at school played too. Nowawdays, I am practically the only one who still plays with an active membership. :\</p>

              <p>Oh, the good ol’ rs! I remember playing my first time on RS when I was at my mums friends house (who had 2 sons) and introduced me to RS. They gave me full Bronze, I was so happy and I was walking along west side of varrock when I met the dark mages/wizards. I thought I could pown them so I attacked them and started to run away, but I didn’t know about how to switch of the auto retaliate thing (I didn’t even know about that!) and died. I really did cry. And remember how hard it was to buy things without G.E?<br>
I also remember the ‘cutting gems’ scam, fell for that every time lol.<br>
Iv’e got so much memories about RS but now, now RS is simply just a pile of shit.</p>
