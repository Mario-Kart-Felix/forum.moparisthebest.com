    <description>OK i have recently made god bows,(not RS likes ones) but my own customized ones.
anyway, i cannot make them shoot arrows, what i means by this is,
i have added to everywhere in client.java, and added it to constants.java.
and it does work, but i cannot use melle if i add it to constants.java, wich is how i made it shoot arrows.
but if I take it out of constants.java it doesn&#39;t shoot arrows, and i can use melle once again.
btw the code i use for my bow(s) is 9224.
anyway, can anyone help me out here?</description>
