    <title>New With Java, Need Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-with-java-need-help/128380</link>
    <description>Started Java not long ago. I&#39;ve been following tutorials and then commenting the lines I understand. I just did a tutorial on painting on a JFrame and there are little bits I need help with. (Sorry for the crappy indentation and spacing). I also need help on how to set the background to white permanently, as setBackground(Color.White); wouldn&#39;t work. 

[code=java]import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import javax.swing.*;  //Imports everything needed.

public class Painter extends JFrame { //Sets the class to Painter and the extends JFrame allows us to use a JFrame. JFrame is imported from the imports above.

   int xvalue = -10, yvalue = -10; //Sets the xvalue and the yvalue to an int of -10.

   public Painter() { //Begins the painter app
      super(&quot;Drag to paint&quot;); //Sets the title

      getContentPane().add(new Label(&quot;Click and drag&quot;), BorderLayout.SOUTH); //Adds a content pane at the bottom. The BorderLayout.SOUTH tells it where.

      addMouseMotionListener			//Need Help with these bits
	        (
	           new MouseMotionAdapter() //Need Help with these bits
	           {
	              public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent event) //Need Help with these bits
	              {
	                 xvalue = event.getX(); //Gets the value of X and Y co-ords.
	                 yvalue = event.getY();
	                 repaint(); //Erases the current screen and redraws and updates a new one?
	              }
	           }
      );
      setSize(500,500); //Sets size
      setVisible(true); //Sets visible with a boolean
  }
     public void paint (Graphics g) //Don&#39;t really understand this bit. I looked at some Java docs and read it helps draw components in Swing.
     {
        g.fillOval(xvalue, yvalue, 10, 10); //Sets the size of the oval. If I wanted it smaller I&#39;d change to 5, 5 or something similiar.
   }
    public static void main( String args[] ) //Starts the main method
      {
         Painter application = new Painter(); //Creates the app
         application.addWindowListener
         (
            new WindowAdapter() //Not really sure?
            {
               public void windowClosing()
               {
                  System.exit(0); //Closes and shuts down the window. I could of also used setDefaultCloseOperation()

               }
            }
         );
      }
}[/code]

I&#39;ve got some lines that I haven&#39;t commented because I didn&#39;t really understand, so if someone could comment them for me and explain them to me, I&#39;d be very grateful :) There are probably mistakes in my commenting as well.</description>

<p>It adds a mouse listener to the window so when somewhere in the window is clicked and dragged, this will detect it and will do everything inside of the opening " { " and closing " } " brackets.</p>

<p>All frames have a main panel (called the <span class="bbcode-i">content pane</span>), to which components are added (labels, buttons, etc.).<br>
That code adds a Label to the bottom of the content pane.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">repaint(); //Erases the current screen and redraws and updates a new one?</code></pre>
<p>That will call the ‘paint’ method.</p>
<p>Ugh. I was really in a helpful mood when I started this response. Now I’m about to fall asleep. I’m sure someone else can help.</p>
