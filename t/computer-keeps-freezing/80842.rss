    <title>Computer Keeps Freezing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-keeps-freezing/80842</link>
    <description>Hello all,
I want to know why my computer just keeps freezing for nothing.

When i start up window on my user, it sometimes just freezes on the welcome screen.
Also, it freezes randomly and it takes like 5 minutes to un freeze it-self.

All of this started happening after i got an update from Automatic Updates. I wonder if Microsoft had anything to do with it. The reason i got my update because my computer just kept on restarting anonymously. I logged in and it said to report a serious error so i did. It came up what was causing it and it was my HP, it said it needed an update. And it said that the HP update was included in the Windows Update Feature. So, i updated Windows and my HP. It said to restart so i did and after the restart, my computer kept on freezing but the random restarting was gone.

Please Help.
Thanks,
Dudeofthed!</description>

<p>I don’t think so. I can play games fine that require DirectX and more than a 16-bit video card. So i do not think that is the problem.</p>

<p>you may have a virus, or something like a logic bomb or something.

I didn’t have anything like this, but everything was just corroding for me and things just kept freezing when switching between applications, It was like the RAM was infested with free radicals.(for biologists, if you don’t know what it is, it is like a protein that acts like a hit and run type of thing breaking connections and bonds in any organism, can cause cancer, reason I know this is because my mom is a biologist.) and it really sucked, I reinstalled and everything works fine, I don’t trust automatic updates, I manuly do it.</p>
