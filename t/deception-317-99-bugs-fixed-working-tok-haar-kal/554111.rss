Hi Moparscape Members,

*Note* This is the latest version, not the one that was sold/leaked (Older)!

After 1 year of developing Deception with my great Friend AJ (Eliminate) we have decided it&#39;s time for it&#39;s release. Other than private sales, there has been leaks, there has been leeches. 
I do not know what else I&#39;ll be doing, other than continuing rsps, but I now have a IRL Job, deception was fun but now we can see more of these types of servers instead of remakes,
Even I am tired of remakes, we should just push to the future instead of the past. So now I bid you guys good bye with Deception, and I hope you guys enjoy it.
Not by me! just Re-releasing!
I give big credits to Eliminate for letting me use his Server/Client base for Deception, and for all the help he has done to make Deception big when it was in it&#39;s
prime time. I do highly recommend to use it, as it&#39;s great you will have to do very small bug fixes, but this is very well worth it. 

Only other thing I ask is, if you do use it or even download it just to check it out please give thanks and reputation to Eliminate, who did most of the work.


Thanks,

Moe.

I&#39;ve decided to release this as Moe and I are done working on Deception. The server was great whilst it lasted and it seemed to be popular due to the sheer fact that it received over 500+ votes within the first week of being launched.

If you do appreciate/like or use this release, please show your appreciation by giving the correct credits if/when hosted.
