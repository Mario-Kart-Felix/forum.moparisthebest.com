    <description>Hi, I want to know how to change which players can spawn, and I want to know how to add the in-game owner crown.
I am using the evolutionx 562 source, here is the ::item command code:

}
	else if(cmd[0].equals(&quot;item&quot;)) {
                if(cmd.length == 2 || cmd.length == 3) {
                    int item = Integer.valueOf(cmd[1]);
                    int amount = 1;
                    if(cmd.length == 3) {
                        amount = Integer.valueOf(cmd[2]);
                    }
                    player.getInventory().addItem(item, amount);
                } else {


I will give Mod on my server (once its up) to the first people that help me with one of these.</description>

<p>There isn’t a crown for a 562 specifically because you may only be either an admin, or a mod, so you can’t make an owner crown, also i am not sure how to make it so that mods may spawn to, and btw that code is for the admin panel, the thing where you press the button under esc, “`”. you would need to add it into the other command packet handler, and in the quotes it needs to say “::item” you will need to ask someone else on changing it to mod rights, since i don’t know, and i have that problem too, hope i helped!</p>

<p>Yes you can make an in-game Owner Crown, look at Bo’s 562 CorruptionX, he’s got one ingame. And yes I know about the command packet handler shit, Wait a second, so your saying unless I put the command “item” into the command packet handler, only people that can use the Admin panel (’, backwards apostraphie) can use the command. Damn I’m stupid, Thanks!</p>
