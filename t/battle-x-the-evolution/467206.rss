This is Battle-X. We are a 317 Server with some updates with the gameframe and items. We are based off of Project Insanity. We hope to finish our project and will post regular updates on what we are doing! I&#39;ll be updating this thread/Redoing the thread layout over the next course of a few days.

We are going to be hosting this server once we get a reasonable amount of work on it. I already have several dedicated servers at my disposal, with 1 CentOS vps as well. You may see it with the rest of the media.

What has been done already?

[QUOTE]1. Added Character/Forum registration accounts are linked to each other.

2. Added a option to hide yourself on hiscores. 

3.  Added a deletion pin which is required to change your ingame accounts 
password. It is also required to have if you want to delete your ingame account.

4. Added an MD5 encryption for character registration.

5. Will be required to be registered on the website inorder to play/login.

6. Everything will be saved to MySQL - banks,inventorys,stats,experience, ect. Each account is limited to 10 ingame accounts, if they want another they will need to delete an ingame account

7. It&#39;s going to be 1 starter set per forum account. 1 Forum account per IP. (Still need to implement this) -won&#39;t be hard to do though.

8. A lot of Content/Skill related work has been done. Will get more into detail later.[/QUOTE]

TODO:
[QUOTE]
1. Add in a Shop Exchange System Via Website

2. Load/Save everything from MySQL - Banks, Inventories, (x,y) coordinates, literally everything.

3. Will list soon.[/QUOTE]


What we will be using.

Updated-ish Warriors Guild
[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/hs6i38.jpg[/img]

New website Template (Currently being worked on by &#39;The Web Guy&#39;!)
Make sure to watch the video below to see how everything actually works or look at the images!

[IMG]http://i50.tinypic.com/10xtxyo.png[/img]


This is the start of making the project fully Website/Server (MySQL) Integrated. I&#39;ll be making it load everything from MySQL once I finish. But yeah, But, uhm. Yeah. The Web Guy &amp; Me are working on a new website template as I made this template within a hour just for testing purposes.

Don&#39;t hate.


The server requires all users to be registered. 
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/1.png[/img]

When you register, you&#39;ll be registering a forum account which will be linked to your ingame account. You can also attach more game accounts to your forum account afterwards.
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/2.png[/img]

Once you finish registering you&#39;ll be asked to login.
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/3.png[/img]

Once you login it will redirect you to your Character Management.
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/4.png[/img]

By setting a Deletion Pin you&#39;re preventing anyone who gains access to your forum account from deleting your ingame account and changing your ingame password. Thus, not being able to steal your items/and or delete your accounts.
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/5.png[/img]

Here we are setting our deletion pin.
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/6.png[/img]

Here we are showing that the deletion pin is set.
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/7.png[/img]


This is where I&#39;m showing that I&#39;m trying to delete my account, it requires a deletion pin obviously.
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/8.png[/img]

This is showing that we deleted our in game account. Not it&#39;s completely gone off the game.
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/9.png[/img]

Here we are, we&#39;re going to add an account. We are limited to 10 ingame accounts. 1 starter set per forum account. So you&#39;ll only get 1 starter set on your first account made.
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/10.png[/img]

Here it is showing we have 10 accounts made, and it won&#39;t allow us to add anymore.
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/11.png[/img]


Well here, we are now logged in. (This is a simple process of just registering, I was just showing you everything.)
[IMG]http://battle-x.net/pix/12.png[/img]


This is a sneak peak at my my Administration/Moderation panel. IE: Transfer other ingame accounts to other peoples forum accounts. Set Subscriptions, 7 days or 30 days. User Security - Look up all accounts linked to eachother by IP and Forum account to see which user has other forum accounts/ingame accounts and if they have logged in other peoples accounts. Item rares &amp; tools - To see the amount of money/items in game and who has them.

I might post pictures of this later, but this part won&#39;t be public anyways.

<p>Yes, it’s pretty nifty. That’s why I did it because some people like having different types of pkers, skillers, mains, and duelers and what not.</p>
