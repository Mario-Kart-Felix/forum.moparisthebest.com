    <title>Forum Entrance Quiz</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/forum-entrance-quiz/40262</link>
    <description>As you know quite a few changes have been going on around here, hopefully for the better.  Well the latest idea that has came up I actually like quite a bit.  With this quiz it would allow people to register, but they would not be allowed to post or private message anyone without first completing a small common sense quiz.  This is needed I think because we can&#39;t help the few users that aren&#39;t willing to first help themselves.

The purpose of this quiz is not to require a certain level of knowledge of anything in particular, it just makes sure that this person has a little bit of common sense and is willing to help themselves.  All of the questions and answers to this quiz can easily be found with the simplest google.com query.

So this thread serves two purposes, to get opinions on this whole idea, and to show you a preliminary quiz, so that you may see it and write more questions for the database from which 10 questions are randomly selected.

The sample quiz is here: http://moparisthebest.com/q.php

If you can write questions and pm them to me I would appreciate it, thanks for the input.

And thanks to Kamu for writing the script. :)</description>

Community Member status upgrade vote. (Krich, this is what I should have offered when I was talking about a member sponsor.) In order to become a CM, two or more CM’s must sponsor you and take complete responsibility for your posts until a probationary period is over. Complete responsibility means loss of karma or other punishments for infractions made by a plebe.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve never really liked that automatic upgrade based on rep - at some point rep becomes devalued, but why keep resetting things when you can just fix them? Even just adding a queue of 50-rep people that would be reviewed would be better. I propose a dual entry system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On suspicion of extreme competence<br>
You attain Community Member status by excelling and catching the interest of a patron or two. They propose your name in a voting board. This involves a short probationary period where the patrons are expected both to help you along if you need it (with WHAT, I’m not sure, but it seems like a provision we should have) and to keep you in line, though with a well-chosen member neither should be necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On proof of extreme popularity (among those with rep to give, that is)<br>
You gain 50 rep. Your name is placed in a queue (or autoposted to a voting board) for review by current Community Members (excluding anyone currently in probation) before granting you access.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, this assumes that the Community Member boards are something worth getting into. We need to work on that - suggestions?[/quote]</p>
<p>I also offered this idea to mopar shortly before he decided to implement the scaled reputation from Kaitnieks. It’s still preferable, but we can easily work with what we’ve got.</p>
<p>The scaled reputation can and should be used in exactly the same way as your proposal; the thread I posted yesterday recommending that everyone ++byte already put it into practice. Having a pool of people who give 3-4 points is close enough to a ‘community’ vote (with 70 some odd CMs, I think, ~15 upvotes should be good enough).</p>
<p>The real problem is why it took this long to notice – I know a lot of you saw/responded to the thread and didn’t do a thing to point to an obviously talented person. =)</p>
<p>Inactivity the silent killer &amp;c.</p>

              <p>How about this:</p>

[li]An ‘idiot of the day’ that rotates with other news in the title of the site (and possibly the link to the stupid statement)[/li]<br>

[/li][li]Warning system that resets after X time. Too many warnings will send the user to a penalty box until a mod clears him.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I agree krich, making the community invite-only would not work here. I should never have mentioned it… bad llama. There are far too many people working on private or semi-private systems with no inclination to releasing their work to the community. This is more of a resource than a ‘hacking repository’.</p>

Kamu, I assume you also would take exception to your reply about my sql post? Your response was completely useless. It was obvious that I was doing nothing more than giving a simplistic example for how easy it is to find duplicate password hashes using a novice SQL query. It was not intended to be used in production nor to teach anyone the true meaning of life. It was a visual example. Nothing more.

I think the quiz is at least a good place to start at, and it looks like most agree, so I will work on a way to integrate it in the next few days as time permits.</p>

              <p>but i thought the idea was not to limit or cap registrations?!? making sponser only rules, with the threat of losing your account  if one of your refered users is an ass. The restrictions need to come on the users posts as there is no gaurentee (i’m being polite) that the IQ level of the current members will allow the site to benefit from references.</p>
<p>I do however, believe the test pushes people along an important line, as to help themselves, but maybe testing is not the way to go… Maybe users &lt;10 posts should only be able to access maybe 5 forums, introduction sections including-</p>
<ul>
<li>posting tutorials</li>
<li>introductions</li>
<li>rules / regs</li>
<li>basic web use guide i.e. GOOGLE!!</li>
<li>java tuts</li>
</ul>
<p>etc. make people read the things you want them to learn, when they first join? this would not only reduce the amount of unnessacary questions on the site but may actually raise peoples awareness and help reduce the “GTFO N00B” ( which i hastent to add, is sometimes needed!!)</p>

<p>lol and I’m a noob at what?</p>
<p>Hey if Mopar asks random questions like What is a Douroucouli? then my question would be more than appropriate. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>[quote=“Mopman, post:30, topic:40262”]At least that shows the ability to search, which 99% of people registering here lack. So it is a good question.</p>
<p>ASCII, not mopar…[/quote]<br>
Ascii and Mopar have nothing to do with each other. I was just asking him to add the question “What is Mopar?” not replace that question with the one I suggested…</p>
