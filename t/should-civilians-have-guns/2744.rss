    <title>Should civilians have guns?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-civilians-have-guns/2744</link>
    <description>Ill be EXTREAMLY disapointed in you Americans who have no clue what the Second Amendment says (Second Amendment... Oh ya, that was in that giant scroll of paper a long time ago wasnt it...  :confused:).

Ok, now in Texas, were allowed to have guns if we get a license, but in states like New York, they are trying to not allow civilians to have guns.

Should normal civilians like you and me be able to have a pistol or rifle under our pillow or something?

I say yes because they are violating the Second Amendment which is the right to bear weapons. &quot;well, if we took the guns away, then people wouldnt get hurt and we would all get along.&quot; (WTF!) A great analogy is &quot;you can take a gun away from a kid but hell just get a Barbie doll and bend it over to use it as a gun.&quot; We were givn the right to have guns so we can keep the government in its place, for balence. Because if people have guns, and the government knows that, then wouldn&#39;t you think that they would think twice bevore they start kidnapping people during the night and slautering because they had said something against the government? Well, I think we all like our Democracy going on here, but what happens if a coue (military overthrow) happens? The Liberals who have said that &quot;no, if nobody had a gun we&#39;d all get along&quot; so they took up the guns, no more guns to keep the country a democracy. Easily, and I mean very easily, all the person in power would have to say is that &quot;ok, side with me or all your loved ones die.&quot; and what the hell can you do but watch you beloved country crumble onder a dictatorship all because you gave up your tiny gun.

Post, Flame eachother but show respect, dont spam please...</description>

              <p>IMHO, Yes civilians need guns!  the best amendment ever was the 2nd, fuck the first, i hate people and i don’t care if i have permission or not I’m going to say what i want. the rest, i don’t remember lol. Best point i ever heard was a while ago, basically it said what does banning civilians from having guns do, if a criminal wants a gun, hes going to get it, regardless of the law, so why put a law in place when all it hurts is civilian gun enthusiasts like myself.</p>

What the fuck is it with you and nuclear weapons? Do they have anything to do with anything in this discussion?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes.[/quote]</p>
<p>Your comparison of strategic nuclear weapons (the big missiles that you’re thinking about) to firearms is simply ridiculous. Yes, they are both designed to kill things, but to create an analogy based solely on that is absurd.</p>
<p>A gun is meant to kill one specific thing (whatever you’re aiming toward) at a time. Strategic arms are intended to destroy anything from a city to <span class="bbcode-i">an entire society</span> at a stroke. The “small” end of modern strategic nuclear weapons is still over ten times more powerful than the bombs that destroyed cities sixty years ago. No one uses them, because even their designers pray that no one will ever have to - they are, and have been since the world realised what they were capable of in 1945, strictly deterrent measures. Guns are both intended to be used and actually used.</p>
<p>[quote=“juju, post:160, topic:2744”][quote author=slayer215 link=topic=3018.msg1218955#msg1218955 date=1177576332]<br>
Is civilians owning them even a rational thought? They would cost millions and millions of dollars to produce. You would have to have a launch pad in your back yard, which probably wouldnt be very cheap, either. And lastly, would you nuke a bank robber and risk the lives of thousands of people nearby? The radiation alone would spread out for miiilllllleeessss and mess up anyone in its path. Therefore a nuclear weapon would not be bloody successful at protecting yourself because you would kill yourself in the process.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Nuclear weapons(on a smaller scale then the ones you are thinking of) can actually be created in your garage for quite cheap(see: Anarchist Cookbook). It’s funny that you mentioned about the kind of damage radiation can do, I mean, guns fire bullets, bullets don’t always hit their targets - same thing, just on a smaller scale.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, you <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> perhaps build a fission package in your garage, if you were given access to a large quantity of what might be the most protected material on the planet or sufficient (highly expensive, generally banned from international trade, and difficult to operate) lab equipment and raw material to synthesize it yourself. But the most difficult part of a nuclear weapon is the fine-tuned delivery system. I’d love to see some idiot try to shape a perfectly spherical layered implosion charge in his garage (as long as he lives far away from me).</p>
<p>As a side note, I’ve made a lot of bad shots before. Not one of my stray bullets has ever destroyed a city or given fifty thousand people cancer.</p>

<p>Why aren’t civilians allowed to horde nuclear weapons?</p>

</aside>
<p>Why the hell would they? Is the answer not obvious?</p>
<p>Guns can at least protect you and others. Nuclear weapons cannot(they might be able to protect your country, but that’s a little different). I could run around with a gun and kill a lot of people sure… I could also run through a crowd with two knives and stab a good amount of people until I am taken down.</p>
<p>The use of guns are supposed to be either hunting or to protect yourself. You won’t be too successful at that with a nuclear weapon.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, under the US Constitution(if you live in the US, that is) you should have the “right” to posess nuclear weapons - the constitution states “the right of the people to keep and bear arms”, <span class="bbcode-i">arms</span> isn’t exactly defined as <span class="bbcode-i">guns</span>.</p>
<p>Now, why would the government break the constitution?</p>
<p>How would a nuclear weapon not be bloody successful at protecting yourself?[/quote]</p>
<p>What the fuck is it with you and nuclear weapons? Do they have anything to do with anything in this discussion? I believe people should be able to have guns to defend themselves from criminals. Even if you outlaw guns, do you think people will stop killing/shooting/pwnz0ring eachother? No! We will find knives, or pretty much anything else to kill someone with. And what the hell do nuclear weapons have to do with anything? Is civilians owning them even a rational thought? They would cost millions and millions of dollars to produce. You would have to have a launch pad in your back yard, which probably wouldnt be very cheap, either. And lastly, would you nuke a bank robber and risk the lives of thousands of people nearby? The radiation alone would spread out for miiilllllleeessss and mess up anyone in its path. Therefore a nuclear weapon would not be bloody successful at protecting yourself because you would kill yourself in the process.</p>
<p>Now my opinion on a solution to shootings like the one at VT is simple. DONT OUTLAW GUNS IN COLLEGES AND STUFF. As stated previously, you people apparently have the idea that if people have guns, they will go around and shoot eachother. Apparently colleges think this too. Anyone that goes to college should know better than this, and be smart enough to be able to use a gun to defend himself. If people at VT could carry guns that Korean dude wouldnt have killed nearly as many people.</p>

<p>Guns can at least protect you and others. Nuclear weapons cannot(they might be able to protect your country, but that’s a little different). I could run around with a gun and kill a lot of people sure… I could also run through a crowd with two knives and stab a good amount of people until I am taken down.</p>
<p>The use of guns are supposed to be either hunting or to protect yourself. You won’t be too successful at that with a nuclear weapon.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, under the US Constitution(if you live in the US, that is) you should have the “right” to posess nuclear weapons - the constitution states “the right of the people to keep and bear arms”, <span class="bbcode-i">arms</span> isn’t exactly defined as <span class="bbcode-i">guns</span>.</p>
<p>Now, why would the government break the constitution?</p>
<p>How would a nuclear weapon not be bloody successful at protecting yourself?</p>
