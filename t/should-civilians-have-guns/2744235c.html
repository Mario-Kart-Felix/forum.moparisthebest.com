<p>It’s a culture thing. America was settled by people who got kicked out of England (and at various times the rest of Europe) because they couldn’t play nice with others (or they wanted jobs. <span class="bbcode-i">sure</span>.)</p>
<p>Only kidding. Anyway, more guns would actually be a solution to this problem. Take a look at <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/V/VIRGINIA_TECH_SHOOTING?SITE=TXBEA&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">what happened</a>. Specifically, look at THIS:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Associated Press:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>A gunman massacred 32 people at Virginia Tech in the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history Monday, cutting down his victims <span class="bbcode-b">in two attacks two hours apart before the university could grasp what was happening and warn students.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s a joke or a bumper sticker from somewhere, and I never thought I’d apply it to something this serious:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>My 1911 is faster than your 911.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The first attack killed one or two people. Then TWO HOURS passed before THIRTY MORE people were killed. If anyone in that huge amount of response time had just shot the bastard, then thirty families would still have their kids tonight. But no, the school environment must be weapons-free and <a href="http://www.legallyarmed.com/kill_zone.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">target-rich</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is hindsight. It’s all easy from here. But what if all we have to do to stop anything like this from happening in the future is to limit the amount of people killed or wounded to one - the one who tries to shoot someone while surrounded by people who are both armed and sane?[/quote]<br>
yep, on a campus where concealed weapons are not allowed.  I bet if their was no law against concealed weapons on that campus one of the kids in that building would have been packing.</p>

<p>So are you saying if guns were illegal that they would not be able to obtain them? The only difference is that they would probably have to pay a little extra for an illegal gun.</p>

<p>Did you read Krichevskoy’s post? The reason 33 people died at virginia tech is that the law banned the law-abiding students that go there from carrying guns, and the criminal knew it.

<p>I’m not saying that having the students more widely armed would have prevented him from trying to kill them - he was obviously out of his mind, logical things like that don’t apply.

<p>Krich I agree entirely with you, but there is something I found kind of disturbing and strange.</p>
<p>Well I’m sure you are aware of Micheal Moore? (the film maker). He did a film about gun violence in the United States called Bowling for Columbine. It’s a really well done video, I think it was about two hours long and there is an immense amount of information and research in this video. Anyways at the beginning, something funny is that there is a bank. It is advertised at the bank that if you sign up, you get a free shotgun. So he goes in there, signs up, and receives his shotgun all within matter of minutes. Then he walks out of the store with his gun.  I don’t know which state this was in, or what year but I thought it was pretty funny for a bank to be handing out guns lol.</p>

<p>An example from that movie (which I was forced to watch in high school, damn liberal teachers) is that he got k-mart to stop carrying 9mm bullets in stock, which accomplished what? Absolutely nothing. Does anyone seriously think if those crazies from columbine went to k-mart and couldn’t get 9mm bullets that they wouldn’t have just went someplace else?</p>

His 9/11 movie was almost total bullshit designed to keep the public from seeing the real truths, watch something with at least some actual facts like <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6495462761605341661" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Martial Law 9/11: Rise of the Police State (Alex Jones)</a> although I don’t agree with a lot of it it has actual facts and touches on Micheal Moore as well.</p>
