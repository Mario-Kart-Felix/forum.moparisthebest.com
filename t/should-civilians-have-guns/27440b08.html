For example: People were aloud to carry guns all the time and he just shot your family member how would you feel? Incredibly bad<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If people were allowed to carry guns all the time, he probably wouldnt have gotten away with all his killing. And what does that have to do with a guy killing one of my family members? Your statement switched topics mid-sentence. But to answer your question, I would feel really bad if he shot one of my family members.[/quote]<br>

What the fuck is it with you and nuclear weapons? Do they have anything to do with anything in this discussion?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes.[/quote]</p>
<p>Your comparison of strategic nuclear weapons (the big missiles that you’re thinking about) to firearms is simply ridiculous. Yes, they are both designed to kill things, but to create an analogy based solely on that is absurd.</p>
<p>A gun is meant to kill one specific thing (whatever you’re aiming toward) at a time. Strategic arms are intended to destroy anything from a city to <span class="bbcode-i">an entire society</span> at a stroke. The “small” end of modern strategic nuclear weapons is still over ten times more powerful than the bombs that destroyed cities sixty years ago. No one uses them, because even their designers pray that no one will ever have to - they are, and have been since the world realised what they were capable of in 1945, strictly deterrent measures. Guns are both intended to be used and actually used.</p>
<p>[quote=“juju, post:160, topic:2744”][quote author=slayer215 link=topic=3018.msg1218955#msg1218955 date=1177576332]<br>
Is civilians owning them even a rational thought? They would cost millions and millions of dollars to produce. You would have to have a launch pad in your back yard, which probably wouldnt be very cheap, either. And lastly, would you nuke a bank robber and risk the lives of thousands of people nearby? The radiation alone would spread out for miiilllllleeessss and mess up anyone in its path. Therefore a nuclear weapon would not be bloody successful at protecting yourself because you would kill yourself in the process.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Nuclear weapons(on a smaller scale then the ones you are thinking of) can actually be created in your garage for quite cheap(see: Anarchist Cookbook). It’s funny that you mentioned about the kind of damage radiation can do, I mean, guns fire bullets, bullets don’t always hit their targets - same thing, just on a smaller scale.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, you <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> perhaps build a fission package in your garage, if you were given access to a large quantity of what might be the most protected material on the planet or sufficient (highly expensive, generally banned from international trade, and difficult to operate) lab equipment and raw material to synthesize it yourself. But the most difficult part of a nuclear weapon is the fine-tuned delivery system. I’d love to see some idiot try to shape a perfectly spherical layered implosion charge in his garage (as long as he lives far away from me).</p>
<p>As a side note, I’ve made a lot of bad shots before. Not one of my stray bullets has ever destroyed a city or given fifty thousand people cancer.</p>

        <p>IMHO, Yes civilians need guns!  the best amendment ever was the 2nd, fuck the first, i hate people and i don’t care if i have permission or not I’m going to say what i want. the rest, i don’t remember lol. Best point i ever heard was a while ago, basically it said what does banning civilians from having guns do, if a criminal wants a gun, hes going to get it, regardless of the law, so why put a law in place when all it hurts is civilian gun enthusiasts like myself.</p>
