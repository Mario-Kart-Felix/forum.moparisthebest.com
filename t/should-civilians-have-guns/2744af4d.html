<p>I think you are missing the point mopar has made so many times already.</p>
<p>If you were not allowed to have guns, that would not stop criminals from carrying them. Then you would have a country full of criminals with guns and citizens without any protection.</p>
<p>You think someone is gonna rob a bank if everyone around him is a law abiding citizen who also owns a gun?</p>

        <p>What he^ said.</p>
<p>A lot of you seem to have a strange strange view that if you allow law-abiding citizens to carry guns that they will go crazy and run around shooting, killing and robbing people.  What ever gave you that idea?  It doesn’t make any sense to me.[br][size=1]Posted on: April 05, 2007, 06:26:50 PM[/size][hr]These are good articles, I suggest you read them:</p>

<p>But it’s hard for them to get the guns here. They don’t just walk down to a shop like Kmart (or Walmart in America), go to the shop assistant, and say “Hi, I’d like a 9mm, a semi-automatic, and 2 boxes of rounds please”.</p>

<blockquote>Britain, Australia top U.S. in violent crime Rates Down Under increase despite strict gun-control measures
<p>Law enforcement and anti-crime activists regularly claim that the United States tops the charts in most crime-rate categories, but a new international study says that America’s former master – Great Britain – has much higher levels of crime.</p>
<p>The International Crime Victims Survey, conducted by Leiden University in Holland, found that England and Wales ranked second overall in violent crime among industrialized nations.</p>
<p>Twenty-six percent of English citizens – roughly one-quarter of the population – have been victimized by violent crime. Australia led the list with more than 30 percent of its population victimized.</p>
<p>The United States didn’t even make the “top 10” list of industrialized nations whose citizens were victimized by crime.</p>
<p>Jack Straw, the British home secretary, admitted that “levels of victimization are higher than in most comparable countries for most categories of crime.”</p>
<p>Highlights of the study indicated that:</p>
<pre><code>* The percentage of the population that suffered "contact crime" in England and Wales was 3.6 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in the United States and 0.4 percent in Japan.

* Burglary rates in England and Wales were also among the highest recorded. Australia (3.9 percent) and Denmark (3.1 per cent) had higher rates of burglary with entry than England and Wales (2.8 percent). In the U.S., the rate was 2.6 percent, according to 1995 figures;

* "After Australia and England and Wales, the highest prevalence of crime was in Holland (25 percent), Sweden (25 percent) and Canada (24 percent). The United States, despite its high murder rate, was among the middle ranking countries with a 21 percent victimization rate," the London Telegraph said.

* England and Wales also led in automobile thefts. More than 2.5 percent of the population had been victimized by car theft, followed by 2.1 percent in Australia and 1.9 percent in France. Again, the U.S. was not listed among the "top 10" nations.

* The study found that Australia led in burglary rates, with nearly 4 percent of the population having been victimized by a burglary. Denmark was second with 3.1 percent; the U.S. was listed eighth at about 1.8 percent.
</code></pre>
<p>Interestingly, the study found that one of the lowest victimization rates – just 15 percent overall – occurred in Northern Ireland, home of the Irish Republican Army and scene of years of terrorist violence.</p>
<p>Analysts in the U.S. were quick to point out that all of the other industrialized nations included in the survey had stringent gun-control laws, but were overall much more violent than the U.S.</p>
<p>Indeed, information on Handgun Control’s Center to Prevent Handgun Violence website actually praises Australia and attempts to portray Australia as a much safer country following strict gun-control measures passed by lawmakers in 1996.</p>
<p>“The next time a credulous friend or acquaintance tells you that Australia actually suffered more crime when they got tougher on guns … offer him a Foster’s, and tell him the facts,” the CPHV site says.</p>
<p>“In 1998, the rate at which firearms were used in murder, attempted murder, assault, sexual assault and armed robbery went down. In that year, the last for which statistics are available, the number of murders involving a firearm declined to its lowest point in four years,” says CPHV.</p>
<p>However, the International Crime Victims Survey notes that overall crime victimization Down Under rose from 27.8 percent of the population in 1988, to 28.6 percent in 1991 to over 30 percent in 1999.</p>
<p>Advocates of less gun control in the U.S. say the drop in gun murder rates was more than offset by the overall victimization increase. Also, they note that Australia leads the ICVS report in three of four categories – burglary (3.9 percent of the population), violent crime (4.1 percent) and overall victimization (about 31 percent).</p>
<p>Australia is second to England in auto theft (2.1 percent).</p>
<p>In March 2000, WorldNetDaily reported that since Australia’s widespread gun ban, violent crime had increased in the country.</p>
<p>WND reported that, although lawmakers responsible for passing the ban promised a safer country, the nation’s crime statistics tell a different story:</p>
<pre><code>* Countrywide, homicides are up 3.2 percent.
* Assaults are up 8.6 percent.
* Amazingly, armed robberies have climbed nearly 45 percent.
* In the Australian state of Victoria, gun homicides have climbed 300 percent.
* In the 25 years before the gun bans, crime in Australia had been dropping steadily.
* There has been a reported "dramatic increase" in home burglaries and assaults on the elderly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>I hate gun control laws,<br>
So a guy breaks into my house with a basball bat and a large knife, wearing a hockey mask.</p>
<p>I can’t shoot him with my Автомат Калашникова образца 1947 года because it’s illegal and I’m a law abiding citzen ?(Yah right, I can’t even spell Yah right)</p>
<p>So then he knocks out my parents…And I can’t shoot him?<br>
So he starts having his way with my mom/brother/dad/dog and I still can’t shoot him?<br>
So then he kills his pleaser, and his/her blood and gore hits me, under the bed, and moves onto another one, and yet if I fired one bullet, I’m in jail for shooting him.<br>
Well then he eats everything the Fridge…How 'bout now?<br>
Well for all you demacrats/whoever wants strict gun control laws, first off, Screw you, second off, I hope this happens to your family and you and your friends, but you and/or them don’t have a/any gun(s),and get raped by this man, but then a couple months later, You find yourself in love with your same sex, becuase he scarred you and that’s the only time you feel happy, when your wasted/plastered and doing The Nasty with a person your same sex.<br>
Ya…<br>
I think I’ll go get some nachos.</p>

</aside>
<p>Ok, so this was about year ago, but its still fun to argue. You have to have a license to use full auto weapons. Do you think just anybody can go up and buy an automatic weapon? With the license you have to apply for comes shit loads of paper work and background checks, to just own one. And how many criminals do you see with full auto weapons? They would have to steal one from one of the few people who went through all the paper work and crap to get it, and Im sure they have them just lying around in the open.</p>

90% is just a random number, I’m not saying that many people are really that dumb(or are they o.O?)<br>
But according to the law we have today, if you have the legal papers to carry a gun, of course you can carry it, but anybody of the appropriate age can get them. They sometimes check background, but only if you look suspicious.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m sorry to inform you, but you have no idea what you are talking about.</p>
<p>Different states have different laws on carrying guns, some allow it, some require some type of permit, some restrict it from certain areas etc etc.  For example, here in ohio I can apply for a concealed carry license, and as long as I pass the background check (no felonies, and other various things) I can take a class, get the permit and carry a gun everywhere except a few places listed in the law (public schools, government buildings…).  If want to ‘open carry’ I am legally allowed to do so without a permit.</p>
<p>Please don’t post misinformation, thanks.[/quote]</p>
<p>Mopar is right. States are allowed to make their own laws on the requirements of being able to carry guns. And for the record, <span class="bbcode-i">carrying</span> guns is completely different than owning. Where I live you just have to have a background check, sign some papers up front, pay the dealer, and you can own a gun. But to carry one in public is different. My dad applied for a carry permit and the process took about a month. He had to have multiple background checks, go to a gun safety class, pay about a hundred dollars, and lots of other crap for it. The state has to really trust you to give you the privilige to carry a firearm in public.</p>
<p>I believe you should be able to own a gun for self defense as long as you have a clean record. I was told that to be able to shoot someone who breaks in your house then you have to fear for your life. Afterwords you would have to go to court and convince the judge and jury that you did, in fact, fear for your life. If this is the case then I am all for it. But look at it this way: Say the person broke in your house or was on your property and you shot him, but you didnt fear for your life or anything. Whats more important, a person’s life or you being pissed off because hes on your property? Also in this thread, people have said that we shouldnt be allowed to have guns because they only create problems. Do you really think that if we, innocent civilians, didnt have guns, then we would be safer against armed criminals? Which also leads to fact that you apparently think that if no one had guns then we would be safe. This is bullshit because we would <span class="bbcode-i">find</span> something to kill people with. We would still use swords or something. As long as there are people, there will be conflict and war, and people killing people. Crime probably wouldnt really go down that much in the long run. But other than those points, Mopar pretty much covered up all the other stupid arguements.</p>
<p>To be honest, though, all it is is logic. If you fear for your life then you should be able to defend yourself, and guns seem to be the most efficient at doing so. So that’s my two cents.</p>

If a person is going to shoot another person, they don’t care if they are legally allowed to carry guns or not.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If its legal to have guns its easier for them to get them.[/quote]</p>
<p>Perhaps, but the bad guy has to consider whether his potential victim may be carrying a gun as well, if guns are illegal the bad guy knows the victim doesn’t have a gun.</p>
<p>Which is why crime goes up when guns are banned.</p>

no guns in my opinion, maybe in rural areas, but in a suburb or a city, i dont want to be shot!!<br>

<p>Obviously you did not read any of the posts above.  More guns lower the crime rate.  Read the posts above![/quote]<br>

<p>Wow, you swore.</p>
<p>COOOL!!!<br>
If you didn’t read my post above, then do so!</p>
<p>If guns suddlenly became illagel, there would be a major riot in every city of (almost) every country in the world.Then when the police force, riot squad, whatever comes to break up the roit, what will the use? Bread? Missiles? Gernades kill people, so those should be illegal to, oops, officer Jones here was beaten to death beacuse he had a breadstick to defend himself, so a knife would kill people, even our hands kill people!<br>
BAN THEM! BAN THEM! BAN THEM! chat the Demacrats (or how ever you f*cking spell it) as they line up to have all their limbs sliced off with a spoon, wait is that a weapon?<br>
BAN IT! BAN IT!</p>
<p>I am a Republican and I support this message<br>
And anouther thing, I live in Minnesota, and here in Minnesota alot of People live ruraly, like 75% percent or something, and Here, in MN, one of our favorite pastimes besides fishing in one of our 11,000 lakes, is to trapshoot.My Dad, Mom, and I own guns. Shotguns,Handguns,Blackpowder,rifles and even old Assalut rifles (My dad has a collecter’s Permit) but anyways, we like to shoot our guns at clay targets that move 75 to 100 mph ,and it’s hard. We also hunt Deer,pheansat,ducks, and squirrels.</p>
<p>You see, without guns, the animal population would skyrocket and food for animals and us would become rare, and millions of animals would die.</p>
<p>Your sick if you think guns are bad!</p>
