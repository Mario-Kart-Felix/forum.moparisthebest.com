    <title>Looking for an expert coder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-an-expert-coder/316493</link>
    <description>i am a beginner coder and i dont know how to code at all. i figure out how to get a client for my server and it has been 100% sucessful.
unfortunatley i have tried alot of sources as a base and all of them have anti leech, if i try an open 1 there are 1 or more of 3 problems.
1.unorginized, hard to follow
2.it sucks
3. it has anti leech even though it says it is open

since i am a beginner coder i don&#39;t know how to take it off. i am tired of trying to find a good source that has no anti leech and is open and orginize, i did find 1 but it said it was open and it had anti leech. all i want is a good,orginized server. i am looking for someone who will code a server for me. 

what you get:
-100% credits
-if i could i would rep++ you but i can&#39;t =p
-co owner
