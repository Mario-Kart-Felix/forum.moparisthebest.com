    <title>Private server on a mac?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/private-server-on-a-mac/299840</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been searching and searching for a tutorial on how to create and run a server on a Mac but have had no such luck. I can&#39;t get boot camp to work so I&#39;m pretty much stuck with Apple for right now. If anyone has a link or if they know of a way to create and run a server on a Mac some help would be much appreciated.</description>
