    <title>Help with home teleport animation please {718}</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-home-teleport-animation-please-718/553770</link>
    <description>Ok, I have figured out what I wanted, but I am still in a bit of a pickle.

Could someone please explain how I can add a delay to the first animation so that it shows?

I have the last animation working, but I need to add a delay to the first. Any and all help will be very much appreciated. Thanks.

Here is what I have written so far.

[code]case &quot;dung&quot;:
    Magic.sendNormalTeleportSpell(player, 0, 0, new WorldTile(3455,3737, 0));
    player.setNextAnimation(new Animation(17108));
    player.setNextGraphics(new Graphics(3224));
    player.setNextGraphics(new Graphics(3225));
    return true;[/code]</description>

I have no idea what revision you’re using, what base, anything. I can only assume it’s 718+ because you keep saying how you “work on 718+” in every thread possible.</p>
