    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/white-gold-giles-milton-a-perilous-journey/155560</link>
    <description>Thomas Pellow is captured by Arab pirates and brought over seas, humiliated, circumsized with no aenasthesia, braved hoardes of men, learned a new language, lost his own language only to appease the Might of one insane Ruler - Sultan Ismail II the most vile and ruthless leader ever - he would make his slaves pick away at ahouse and watch it collapse on them - one of his favourite tourtures was to have someone sawn in half, not always form the head and he had his black guard of nubian eunachs perfect Tossing where two men would shoot you into the ait and on the reverse propel you into the ground.
This is a great, great,great book that should be read by all!
