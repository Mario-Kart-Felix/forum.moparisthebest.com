    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thing-with-player-drops/227895</link>
    <description>so, i need help to make it so that if player is in certain area (i will make it PK area) and dies. HOW to make it so, that he doesnt drop his own stuff but he drops something what i have set it to)

example:
so if i kill player there i would get a p hat (the other player (=who i killed) doesnt have one, and he can doesnt lose any of his stuff.)

PLZ help me with this. if i get this working i can release my minigame if anybody wants me to.</description>
