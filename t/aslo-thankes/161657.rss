<li>I’ll have a look and edit this post when I find something</li>
<li>Within class Client’s run method, where playerName is assigned the users playerName, under that put;<br>
server.playerHandler.messageToAll = playerName + " has just logged on, there are now " + server.playerHandler.playerCount() + " players online.";<br>
So, open up the file called “Client.java”, and hold the control key, and press F. Now type in "playerName = ". This will take you to where playerName is assigned.<br>
Under that line, put this;</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">server.playerHandler.messageToAll = playerName + " has just logged on, there are now " + server.playerHandler.playerCount() + " players online.";</code></pre>

<p>To make items untradable, xerocheez did this, so go into the file called “client.java”, class client, then look for “untradable[]” You should come to something like this;<br>
public int untradable[] = { }; // all untradable items here bitchez<br>
Add the item ID to that array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t know sorry, I’m not near a server source.</p>
</li>
