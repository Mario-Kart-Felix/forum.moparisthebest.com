    <title>Developing a Report/Review System for Hairdressing Salons</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/developing-a-report-review-system-for-hairdressing-salons/358495</link>
    <description>Hi, my next door neighbour owns a hair salon and has come to me with an idea, their current system &quot;Shortcuts&quot; is a booking program which allows them to assign appointments to staff, for the value, what was purchased etc. this is then put into the staff profile and is stored.

it generates reports, however they are hard to read. What he asked me is would it be possible to create an application which took the information from shortcuts (it outputs an XML document) and implement it into an bespoke application for us to use that information and generate our own reports. In our own reports we would have colour coded items if the staff are meeting their targets, based on hours worked and their previous salon experience.

Currently they have a excel spreadsheet which they use for this, but its not very good as they have lots and lots of excel documents and have to input all the data manually, data intensive.

The reports need to be able to be done daily, weekly and per period. there are 13 periods in a year, in each period is 4 weeks and in each week is 6 working days.

The staff would each have their own targets for each day and the end-user would be able to modify these if need be, different targets would be number of clients, total revenue, customer satisfaction, and a few others... these would be compared to the imported data from the shortcuts output file to generate a percentage and finally display some information which they can look at and they can then review that person and say &quot;yes your doing great&quot; or &quot;wtf is up with this shit&quot; and can show them with colours what they have been doing in certain areas.

I said this was all possible through create, I proposed I would create a Java application which was a node based system and integrated with a MySQL server to store/grab the data from.

However I would like your opinion of different ways of going about it, as I am still quite unsure in my own head of how it will all work.

If there are any things i have missed out just ask.</description>

              <p>I’m assuming you want to store it in a database for proper chronological order and for better organization. Sounds good. If the barber shop is willing to invest monthly into this system, tell them to buy a (cheap) server and host a database server on it in order so that you can schedule a service or cron job (depending on what OSs are used there) on the master computer to synchronize with the database at the end of the day. Also, you can get more money as you can charge them for the hosting (typically you should charge them what the virtual hosting actual costs, don’t abuse :)), setup and monthly maintenance. I do this with all clients who I’ve made websites for.</p>

              <p>abraham yes, the user doesn’t want to see the XML at all, I have no choice but to use the conventions of the shortcuts program (its closed-source), they quoted £30,000 for them to build the salon a custom reporting system, yet they would not be allowed to use it in other salons.</p>
<p>I can post you a output of the shortcuts XML but basically its standard, what you would expect.</p>
<p>It outputs the XML file and asks you where to save it, this is where the staff would save it into the directory of my program or their documents or w/e then use a file locator to read in the data, this would add that days XML info to the already existing database for the current day, whilst keeping the data for all the previous days too. I assume I am going to need to use MySQL and store the data for each in a new record.</p>

What I want to do is take the output and produce an easy to read document relating to previous reports, eventually i want to be able to compare a staff members performance over a period of time, and produce a nice graph for the end user to look at.</p>
