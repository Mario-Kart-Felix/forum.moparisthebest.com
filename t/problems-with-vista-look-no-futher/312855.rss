    <title>Problems with vista? Look no futher!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-vista-look-no-futher/312855</link>
    <description>What i noticed about the windows vista is that almost all servers that are manually created do not work. I found out why and how to solve this problem.

1-Make sure you have classpaths(obvious)
2- VERY IMPORTANT!!
     Since most vista computers have a programs file and a programs file (x86), when running, compiling or using a client there is usually somthing you have to do:
         Right click the compile or run and click edit
         Edit all the versions of jdk to your current version
         ~MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE THE PATH FROM C:\Program Files to C:\Program Files (x86).......
3- Make sure the compile and run are coded properly
4- If this does not continue to work, the client/server may not be compatible with vista and you may need a differant one =(

Hope this helped =)</description>
