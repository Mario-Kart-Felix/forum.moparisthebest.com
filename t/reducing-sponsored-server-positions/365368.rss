    <title>Reducing sponsored server positions?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reducing-sponsored-server-positions/365368</link>
    <description>I&#39;m considering lowering the number of sponsored server positions that are sold each month, in the past it has always been 10, and I&#39;m thinking of lowering it to 5 to see what happens.  What do you guys think about that?</description>

There is a reason people will pay more if there are less slots somewhere. Reducing the number of sponsored slots does not change the percent of people that will click on sponsored servers (we’ll call them ‘sponsored’ people) instead of the normal servers. All it does is spread the ‘sponsored’ people (people that click on the first shiny thing they see) between 5 servers instead of 10.</p>
<p>EDIT - I just want it to be known that I do not dislike or not support this idea, I just don’t see what good it will do.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t think there are ‘sponsored people’ who will only use sponsored servers.  I think some people won’t click off the first page, but if the ‘other’ servers are more visible I think they will get more use.[/quote]It’s not that they will only use sponsored servers, it’s that they use the sponsored servers because people think that they are better than the normal servers.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/orp">@ORP</a> - There was a thread about that, MITB asked for suggestions. (besides buying the server, client and update server)</p>

<p>Yeah. And it seriously pisses me off. I don’t care if he’s getting money for it. I want my players that I deserve, and I’m not going to pay 300 fucking dollars for them. Some mother fucker can download a source someone made and put it online and all of a sudden get 300-500 players on it just because they have the money to make that happen? No, fuck that. We need to go back 2 years.</p>

<p>I think having five would bring a lot more attention to the non-sponsored. I can agree with this idea a lot.<br>

I think we need either 10 or 0.</p>

</aside>
<p>Then the whole point of this suggestion being made is quite useless because now that I think about it; your about about that. Because a lot of people would want to go the sponsored servers the most than the normal ones. Then again the traffic that comes to MoparScape as far as the server status is I believe the Sponsored server and MoparScape is the first one who have a status page out of the three big RSPS communities? Therefore MoparScape has a lot of reputation just because of it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Sponsored servers help the site go into better development with people who’d like to sell Mopar work.</p>
<p>And, just because there is 5 instead of 10, doesn’t mean anything but there is 5 less.<br>
If people don’t seem intrested in the 5 servers, they can just go to any other server. It increase the chances of having more traffic to non sponsored servers.</p>
