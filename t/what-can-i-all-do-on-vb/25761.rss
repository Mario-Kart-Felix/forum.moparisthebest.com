              <p>Well english is a huge asset to programming. And you’ll find out very quickly just how often your spelling will make a difference when it comes to coding.</p>
<p>VB is generally a crappy language but if used right there is a lot it can do. No you won’t be creating the next big high quality 3d mmorpg with it, but you can make some fairly simple games and applications. You can also make “runescape autos” with it, but really you’d only be making mimic programs of SCAR.</p>
<p>I never really did realise it until recently when I started to learn java(which you may want to consider learning instead, or c++) but it really is true about how vb makes you lazy and gives bad coding habbits.</p>
