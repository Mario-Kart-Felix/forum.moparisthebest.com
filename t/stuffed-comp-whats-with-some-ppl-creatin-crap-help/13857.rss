    <description>what with some people they create viruses.

one day i turned on my computer. the mouse wasnt working. my dad tryed everything, from loose cables to settings. then i realised the internet wasnt working ethier but it wasnt uninstalled. i tyed singing in MSN MESSENGER but it said i had an invail ip address. my dad thiks it has something to do with the driver corupting. my dad fully scanned the computer with avast and avg free. it found nothing. then he repaired windows. the mose started to work and so did the internet. then the next day i switched it on again and the net wasnt working. funny thing is that i have wireless broadband and the internet on my other computer is still working. the computer is also very very slow in loading. slower than before, so if there is any HELP out there please post. 

thanks, sid</description>

              <p>Question for you mr sidishere, why ask on these forums about computer problems, their are forums designed specifically for these problems with people who can actually help you, im not saying dont come here but i mean you would be better off googling your problem and finding either the answer, or some forums where you can ask it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
