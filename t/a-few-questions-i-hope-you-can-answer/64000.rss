              <p>Modified your post…I was confused why you didn’t seem to type anything below the quote…plus, makes it easier to read <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Not quite.  Server emulators aren’t using jagex’s code, and are violating no copyright laws.  It can be argues that private server clients do as they use the runescape client, but none of them are hosted on this site <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t know of any articles…check out <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/smf</a> though for more info</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SRL is a library for SCAR, whereas SCAR is the color-clicker that performs the procedures in SRL.  They are also developed separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would guess most of those use SCAR or some other bot…don’t know what tbh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ARGA is one…rs-resources.com</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason I said that this is best suited for this forum is because technically dicsussions regarding moparscape and private servers don’t belong here.  But as you asked many different questions, I allowed it.</p>
<p>As for your last question…I honestly don’t know why that would be.  Does that double-type occur with any other characters?</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>No one stole any of jagex’s code.  winterlove originally made an Rs2 server emulator which pretty much just supported walking and multiplayer.  Since then, many others have expanded on it, and the fad grew rapidly on this site, leading to the wide array of servers you see on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> [/quote]anywhere i could an article about it?</li>
</ol>
<p>[quote=“BobDole81, post:2, topic:64000”]4) SRL is the SCAR Resource Library…from what I know about it, its mainly a collection of procedures useful for RS Cheating…don’t quote me though.  Just check out the SRL forums here.   [/quote]i thought it was some sorty omg (oh my god) thing what ever its called on english. but why a srl and scar forum whent its the same?</p>
<p>[quote=“BobDole81, post:2, topic:64000”]5) Not a chance.  Jagex has much improved their protocol, and I’m sure that any kind of autorune-like “bot” (or whatever you want to call it) would be easily detected. [/quote]yeah i bet it would but then why cant scar be detected? ive seen like 500 lvl 3 noobs cutting yews in varrock with auto’er.</p>
<p>[quote=“BobDole81, post:2, topic:64000”]6)  I don’t think anyone will go and revive Aryan (I don’t know of the feasibility of it tbh).  But there are several other Rs2 bot developments out there…   [/quote]any names or sites?</p>
<p>[quote=“BobDole81, post:2, topic:64000”]Can’t really answer the other two for you… [/quote]ah well it dosent matter so much ^^^^</p>
