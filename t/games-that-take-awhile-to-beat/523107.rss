    <description>Hey I was wondering what games on the marketplace that take a LONG TIME to beat the game. Like maybe a game like skyrim I was thinking, but people told me it wasn&#39;t worth it. Whats a game thats like runescape and has a long campaign is basically what i&#39;m asking.</description>

              <p>Dragon Age: Origins - Great game, would sure replay 'cause there are so many possibilities.<br>
The Elder Scrolls: III Morrowind - Personally my favorite game.<br>
The Elder Scrolls: IV Oblivion - Gives some more story to Morrowind and the “Shivering Isles” add-on is pure gold!<br>
The Elder Scrolls: V Skyrim - Liquid cheesecake! And the last DLC, “Dragonborn”, even more of the liquid cheesecake!<br>
Divinity II: Dragon Knight Saga - Strange and special, good one anyway!<br>
Dungeon Siege II/III - At least the second one (DS II) is really long and addictive.</p>
<p>A game shorter than it’s name:<br>
Crysis 3 - The exact moment I felt this game started, I was reading the end credits. And they are the longest part of the game ~30 minutes!</p>
<p>Ummm… I wrote this and remembered you’re using a console… I’ll post it anyway.</p>

Animal Crossing New Leaf. I guarantee it’s incredibly longer than any game mentioned so far and to be mentioned.<br>

              <p>Hey I was wondering what games on the marketplace that take a LONG TIME to beat the game. Like maybe a game like skyrim I was thinking, but people told me it wasn’t worth it. Whats a game thats like runescape and has a long campaign is basically what i’m asking.</p>
