    <description>Purpose: Making a easy way to sell specific items fast.

This will make it so when a certain object is clicked certain items in your inventory will instantly be sold.

Here is how to add this:

First open up client.java

Add in this void:

[code]public void buyItem(){
if (playerIsMember &lt; 1 )
{
sendMessage(&quot;You need to be a member to sell custom items.&quot;);
} else {
int[] a =
{
####, ####
};
int[] b =
{
####, ####
};
int c = 0;

for (int i : a)
{
if (playerHasItem(i))
{
deleteItem(i, getItemSlot(i), 1);
addItem(995, b[c]);
}
c++;
}
}
}[/code]

Now to explain the code.

[code] if (playerIsMember &lt; 1 )
{
sendMessage(&quot;You need to be a member to sell items.&quot;);
[/code]

^This part is pretty simple. Just saying you must be a member to sell items. You may change or delete that if you want.^

[code] int[] a =
{
####, ####
};
int[] b =
{
####, ####
};
int c = 0;[/code]

^This part is a little more complicated. Basicly int[] a are the items that can be sold. int[]b is how much each item is worth. You may add more item ids as you need. Here is a example of those in use.^

[code] int[] a =
{
1111, 2222
};
int[] b =
{
10000, 50000
};[/code]

^So that is saying if you have item id 1111 in your inventory and click the object you will receive 10000gp for it, and if you have item id 2222 in your inventory you will receive 50000gp. But if you have item id 1111 and 2222 in your inventory you will receive 60000gp.^

[code] for (int i : a)
{
if (playerHasItem(i))
{
deleteItem(i, getItemSlot(i), 1);
addItem(995, b[c]);
}
c++;
}
}
}[/code]

^Ok the last bit of the code. Pretty simple and you can probably understand it just by looking at it but I will explain it anyways. It is saying if the player has an item from &quot;int[] a&quot; then delete that item from their inventory and add the amount of item id 995 (money) based on the number written in &quot;int[] b.&quot; ^

We arn&#39;t done yet. Now we have to add something that will stop people from accidentally selling their items.

So to do this add this with the rest of your dialogue cases:

[code] case 12000:
sendFrame171(1, 2465);
sendFrame171(0, 2468);
sendFrame126(&quot;Are you sure you want to sell your items?&quot;, 2460);
sendFrame126(&quot;Yes!&quot;, 2461);
sendFrame126(&quot;No!&quot;, 2462);
sendFrame164(2459);
NpcDialogueSend = true;
break;[/code]

Now go to case 9157 and add this:

[code]} else if (NpcDialogue == 12000) {
buyItem();[/code]

I&#39;m not going to add anything for the &quot;no&quot; option but you can if you want.
Now here is the last step. Add this case with the rest of them in client.java

[code] case ####: // change the #s to your object id.
NpcDialogue = 12000;
break;[/code]

Hopefully this tutorial helped you out :)</description>

<p>Now to explain the code.</p>
<p><code> if (playerIsMember &lt; 1 )
{
sendMessage("You need to be a member to sell items.");
</code></p>
<p>^This part is pretty simple. Just saying you must be a member to sell items. You may change or delete that if you want.^</p>
<p><code> int[] a =
{

int[] b =

<p>^So that is saying if you have item id 1111 in your inventory and click the object you will receive 10000gp for it, and if you have item id 2222 in your inventory you will receive 50000gp. But if you have item id 1111 and 2222 in your inventory you will receive 60000gp.^</p>
<p><code> for (int i : a)
{

}
c++;
}
}
}</code></p>
<p>^Ok the last bit of the code. Pretty simple and you can probably understand it just by looking at it but I will explain it anyways. It is saying if the player has an item from “int[] a” then delete that item from their inventory and add the amount of item id 995 (money) based on the number written in “int[] b.” ^</p>
<p>We arn’t done yet. Now we have to add something that will stop people from accidentally selling their items.</p>

<p><code> case 12000:

Now here is the last step. Add this case with the rest of them in client.java</p>
