    <title>Sever already in use?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sever-already-in-use/453708</link>
    <description>So apparently the source wont run, &#39;server already in use&#39;. Now I did look around, and Google looking for the issue, Utorrent and No-IP are closed, NETGEAR is port-forwarded, and I&#39;ve also checked my ports use with cports and netstat, witch is the same shit.
Aslo, Before I entered my No-IP into the Server.java, the server would run fine with localhost as the IP.

I would appreciate the help, thanks.</description>

              <p>That’s was i’m trying to explain… Cports is a program witch tells you, your computers running ports, and no ports are running on 43594.<br>
I also used Netstat in command prompt witch also does the same thing, No programs on my computer are using port 43594.</p>
<p>Also, I change the ports on the Server.java, to anything… and it still says server in use.<br>
The server would go online with the Localhost - 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1<br>
as soon as I changed it to my No-IP it went to server already in use.</p>

              <p>You have something running on your computer with the same port as the server … check the server port and then check your computer for running ports … close out that application (google how to do it :P)</p>
