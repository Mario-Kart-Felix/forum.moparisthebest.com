    <title>[667] Making A Shop take Points?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-making-a-shop-take-points/465272</link>
    <description>The title is pretty much self explanitory. I set up my shop, buy sendinfo, my buy, my prices, and it wil not take the points. My points are prestigepoints.

When i click on the item to see the cost, it says the item id pointed out in shop (sphinx Tokens),

[b]How can i make it so it will take player.prestigePoints[/b]?</description>
