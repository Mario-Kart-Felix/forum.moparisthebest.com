    <title>You don&#39;t have the required runes to cast this spell?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/you-dont-have-the-required-runes-to-cast-this-spell/476084</link>
    <description>Hello i added a polypore staff and i made it auto attack if i attack an npc.
The problem is i added the spell id from smoke blitz which is 41 and i made it so that you don&#39;t need any runes for smoke blitz but that you only have to wield the polypore staff.
Now if i attack an npc it says i don&#39;t have the required runes :O lol.
So i think i have the spellId wrong of the smoke blitz.

So maybe can someone help me with the spellid (not the magicId!)
