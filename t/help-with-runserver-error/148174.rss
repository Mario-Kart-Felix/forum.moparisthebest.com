    <title>Help with runserver error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-runserver-error/148174</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;m having a little trouble getting my runserver to work. It has worked for a little over a week, until today.
This is the error I get:
[code]Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 17
        at ItemHandler.loadItemList(ItemHandler.java:312)
        at ItemHandler.&lt;init&gt;(ItemHandler.java:39)
        at server.main(server.java:28)
Azn Server.

[/code]

I get this while using my normal runserver, and the one in The perfect compiler. When I compile the server I get no errors. I had just recently added Silab items, using tico&#39;s tut. It worked fine and I got no errors. I started the server and didnt get this error. I logged into my admin account and spawned some items. Seeing some items were in the wrong place I added them into my Item4. I then added some bonuses to item.cfg.
I compiled the server and got no errors. I went to run the server and got this error. I have tried reinstalling java. Yes I have jdk. When I try to log into the server with this error it auto disconnects me and says my account is already logged on. 

Any help will be appreciated, thank you to all who post. :)</description>
