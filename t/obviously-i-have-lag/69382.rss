    <title>Obviously I have lag</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/obviously-i-have-lag/69382</link>
    <description>Hello

I made my server open a couple of weeks ago.  Ever since it&#39;s been open I&#39;ve had people complaining about lag problems.  I had somebody help me before and he got me a new antilag.  That helped a good amount of people who have logged into my server, but it hasn&#39;t comletely solved the problem.  I know it can&#39;t be my computer as it isn&#39;t slow while running my server at all.  So could somebody post some ideas as to how I could solve this problem?</description>
