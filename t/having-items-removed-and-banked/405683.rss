    <description>Ok well I do have a Project Insanity source and I am trying to make it where when you teleport to a certain place all of your items are removed from the player and put into the players bank, Even the items the player is wearing. I have seen something like this on mopar but I cannot find it and yes I&#39;ve searched, to be exact I went to page 210 and couldn&#39;t find it so... Also I searched google ect.. lol I have been looking for this code for quite a while. So, Please help.</description>
