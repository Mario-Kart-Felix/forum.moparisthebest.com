    <title>Smelting with proper interface (Delta)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/smelting-with-proper-interface-delta/436976</link>
    <description>Most people coding will learn very quickly the furnace ID&#39;s do not work well in using the smelting interface. Even when you can get them to work, the bars are all brown, rather than being the right color. What people coding delta might not realize is the set up is already in the code. So I am going to show you a way to make Delta smelt and do it with 1, 5, and 10 bars. (Sorry do not understand the X amount yet)

Where you will be coding:
client.java
clickingmost.java

First we need to set the interface up, so open client.java, and do a search for 
[code]case 192:[/code]
This is the use item on an object case. Look almost right below it, and you should find this:
[code]if (UsedOnObjectID == 3994) {
				for (int fi = 0; fi &lt; misc.smelt_frame.length; fi++)
					sendFrame246(misc.smelt_frame[fi], 150, misc.smelt_bars[fi]);
				sendFrame164(2400);
				// smelting = true;
				// smelt_id = ItemID;
			}[/code]
Most people would not think about the odject ID here, cause they would never find it. It is not something you have a first click action, thus it will not provide the ID when clicked. This code is for a very small furnace in Tyras Camp I discovered. All you need to do is change the object ID to one of the actual smelting furnaces (11666 or 2781) Do not alter any other part of the code, as it will no longer work. You can also add multiple furnaces as well, like this:
[code]if (UsedOnObjectID == 11666 || UsedOnObjectID == 2781 || UsedOnObjectID == 3994) {
				for (int fi = 0; fi &lt; misc.smelt_frame.length; fi++)
					sendFrame246(misc.smelt_frame[fi], 150, misc.smelt_bars[fi]);
				sendFrame164(2400);
				// smelting = true;
				// smelt_id = ItemID;
			}[/code]
Now this is what all of this does:
[code]if (UsedOnObjectID == 11666 || UsedOnObjectID == 2781 || UsedOnObjectID == 3994) {[/code]
These are the object ID&#39;s for furnaces. It tells the game these are the furnaces you will do the action with. There are more, but in my game they are used for other things. If you wish to add more furnaces, remember to divide them with the || codes. 
[code]for (int fi = 0; fi &lt; misc.smelt_frame.length; fi++)[/code]
This sets the framework, and makes the proper bars show on the interface. It tells the game the fi seen in the below code needs to begin at 0. The misc.smelt_frame is where the string (A line of ID&#39;s strung together) is placed and needs to be read. fi++ is telling it as it goes across, the ID should increase. There is not a single thing that needs to be done to this, but this can be used in other coding with other strings set up. It is good to learn what this does.
[code]sendFrame246(misc.smelt_frame[fi], 150, misc.smelt_bars[fi]);
				sendFrame164(2400);[/code]
Here you see the fi is utilized in two other strings which are also found in misc.java. Because of the code above, they will also progress through the string going across the interface. sendFrame164(2400) is the proper smelting interface ID. This is telling the game what interface to open up

Ok, this is all there is in client so save it, and open the clickingmmost.java:

First, you will need the ID&#39;s for the buttons on the smelting interface. I will provide them:

[table]

[td]15161[/td]
[td]24253[/td]
[td]29020[/td]
[td]29024[/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

I will provide a code for one of the 5 bars, so you can see what is done to make it remove and add 5. 

[code]
			case 29025://Runite Bar 5
                        if (c.playerLevel[13] &gt;= 85) {
                        if (!c.playerHasItem(451, 5)) {
                        c.sM(&quot;You need 5 Runite ore to smelt 5 Runite.&quot;);
			c.RemoveAllWindows();
                        } else {
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
                        c.addSkillXP(250, 13);
			c.startAnimation(899);
                    	c.animationReset = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1500;
                        c.sM(&quot;You smelt 5 Runite bars.&quot;);
			c.RemoveAllWindows();
                        }
                        } else {
                        c.sM(&quot;You need a smithing level of 85 to smelt Runite.&quot;);
			c.RemoveAllWindows();
                        }
				break;[/code]
It does not at all have to be this elaborate, but I do like things providing messages for things if it is not correct. Lets go through it though. 
[code]case 29025://Runite Bar 5
                        if (c.playerLevel[13] &gt;= 85) {
                        if (!c.playerHasItem(451, 5)) {
                        c.sM(&quot;You need 5 Runite ore to smelt 5 Runite.&quot;);
			c.RemoveAllWindows();
                        } else {[/code]
The top line is the button ID you click. In this case it is for smelting 5 rune ores.
The second line is telling the game what level you need to be at in order to smelt the bars. Smelting is a part of smithing, so it will fall under that skill [13]
The third line is telling the game that if you DO NOT have 5 rune ores (451) to send the message located below. In order for the DO NOT part of this line to work, a &quot;!&quot; needs to be placed in front of the code. This is what is telling the game that if you do not have it, then send the message.

Here is where most people, myself included have run into the trouble. I am not certain if this is the case on other servers, but delta it is the case. If you try to add
[code]deleteItem(451, 5)[/code]
it flat out will not work. Why? Because only stackable items as far as I can see can work with this form. This is why it is set up differently such as below
[code]
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
                        c.addSkillXP(250, 13);
			c.startAnimation(899);
                    	c.animationReset = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1500;
                        c.sM(&quot;You smelt 5 Runite bars.&quot;);
			c.RemoveAllWindows();[/code]
As you can see from this, 5 ores will be removed c.deleteItem(451) and in its place 5 bars will be added c.addItem(2363)
AddSkillXP(250, 13) adds the amount of exp on the left to the smelting skill which is 13.
startAnimation(899) is the animation for smelting. And this is set to run on a timed amount which is determined by
animationReset
sM of course is where you place the message of the action being performed. 

[code]
                        }
                        } else {
                        c.sM(&quot;You need a smithing level of 85 to smelt Runite.&quot;);
			c.RemoveAllWindows();
                        }
				break;[/code]
This is answering the &quot;if(playerlevel[13] &gt;= 85){&quot; above. If you are not at this level, it will send you this message, rather than performing the action. 

And this can be duplicated throughout all of the clicking button codes, and set up. Just add and delete the amounts of items being removed and replaced by bars. Be sure to change your level requirement, ores, bars, and Exp gained. 

In my game coal has been implemented into the frey where it belongs. But as some would know you cannot have 80 coal in your inventory to smelt the 10 rune ores (requires 8 coal per bar) And of course I do not wish to give all the secrets away :) But this will certainly make anyone who hates smithing one bar at a time much happier. Also you can remove the old crappy smelting codes that come with most all Delta servers. I reduced almost 25 codes to this singular code in my client by doing this. It is more effective, cleaner, and works a lot better. As soon as I can figure out the X amount, I will add it.</description>

<p>Nice tutorial but you should put this into a handler. Will be much better.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True. I have become very good friends with handlers and class pages as of late lol.<br>
There is 7 if(objectID == ****) cases in my client<br>
4 UsedOnObject<br>
13 if(NPCID == ****) etc. The game runs fricking amazing, and I basically have an unlimited amount of space to work with. Transportation, most of the skills, etc have been removed to a separate page already. This one was actually discovered a couple months ago, and I forgot about it, until coming across a help for it. So I decided to make it available. But definitely a handler would be better suited.</p>

			}</code><br>
Most people would not think about the odject ID here, cause they would never find it. It is not something you have a first click action, thus it will not provide the ID when clicked. This code is for a very small furnace in Tyras Camp I discovered.

You can also add multiple furnaces as well, like this:</p>
<p><code>if (UsedOnObjectID == 11666 || UsedOnObjectID == 2781 || UsedOnObjectID == 3994) {

				// smelting = true;
				// smelt_id = ItemID;
			}</code><br>
Now this is what all of this does:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>These are the object ID’s for furnaces. It tells the game these are the furnaces you will do the action with. There are more, but in my game they are used for other things. If you wish to add more furnaces, remember to divide them with the || codes.</p>

<p>This sets the framework, and makes the proper bars show on the interface. It tells the game the fi seen in the below code needs to begin at 0. The misc.smelt_frame is where the string (A line of ID’s strung together) is placed and needs to be read. fi++ is telling it as it goes across, the ID should increase. There is not a single thing that needs to be done to this, but this can be used in other coding with other strings set up. It is good to learn what this does.</p>
<p><code>sendFrame246(misc.smelt_frame[fi], 150, misc.smelt_bars[fi]);
				sendFrame164(2400);</code><br>
Here you see the fi is utilized in two other strings which are also found in misc.java. Because of the code above, they will also progress through the string going across the interface. sendFrame164(2400) is the proper smelting interface ID. This is telling the game what interface to open up</p>
<p>Ok, this is all there is in client so save it, and open the clickingmmost.java:</p>
<p>First, you will need the ID’s for the buttons on the smelting interface. I will provide them:</p>

<p>I will provide a code for one of the 5 bars, so you can see what is done to make it remove and add 5.</p>
<p><code>
			case 29025://Runite Bar 5
                        if (c.playerLevel[13] &gt;= 85) {
                        if (!c.playerHasItem(451, 5)) {
                        c.sM("You need 5 Runite ore to smelt 5 Runite.");
			c.RemoveAllWindows();
                        } else {
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
                        c.addSkillXP(250, 13);
			c.startAnimation(899);
                    	c.animationReset = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1500;
                        c.sM("You smelt 5 Runite bars.");
			c.RemoveAllWindows();
                        }
                        } else {
                        c.sM("You need a smithing level of 85 to smelt Runite.");
			c.RemoveAllWindows();
                        }
				break;</code><br>
It does not at all have to be this elaborate, but I do like things providing messages for things if it is not correct. Lets go through it though.</p>
<p><code>case 29025://Runite Bar 5
                        if (c.playerLevel[13] &gt;= 85) {
                        if (!c.playerHasItem(451, 5)) {
                        c.sM("You need 5 Runite ore to smelt 5 Runite.");
			c.RemoveAllWindows();
                        } else {</code><br>
The top line is the button ID you click. In this case it is for smelting 5 rune ores.<br>
The second line is telling the game what level you need to be at in order to smelt the bars. Smelting is a part of smithing, so it will fall under that skill [13]<br>
The third line is telling the game that if you DO NOT have 5 rune ores (451) to send the message located below. In order for the DO NOT part of this line to work, a “!” needs to be placed in front of the code. This is what is telling the game that if you do not have it, then send the message.</p>
<p>Here is where most people, myself included have run into the trouble. I am not certain if this is the case on other servers, but delta it is the case. If you try to add</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>it flat out will not work. Why? Because only stackable items as far as I can see can work with this form. This is why it is set up differently such as below</p>
<p><code>
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
                        c.addItem(2363, 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
			c.deleteItem(451, c.getItemSlot(451), 1);
                        c.addSkillXP(250, 13);
			c.startAnimation(899);
                    	c.animationReset = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1500;
                        c.sM("You smelt 5 Runite bars.");
			c.RemoveAllWindows();</code><br>
As you can see from this, 5 ores will be removed c.deleteItem(451) and in its place 5 bars will be added c.addItem(2363)<br>
AddSkillXP(250, 13) adds the amount of exp on the left to the smelting skill which is 13.<br>
startAnimation(899) is the animation for smelting. And this is set to run on a timed amount which is determined by<br>
animationReset<br>
sM of course is where you place the message of the action being performed.</p>
<p><code>
                        }
                        } else {
                        c.sM("You need a smithing level of 85 to smelt Runite.");
			c.RemoveAllWindows();
                        }
				break;</code><br>
This is answering the “if(playerlevel[13] &gt;= 85){” above. If you are not at this level, it will send you this message, rather than performing the action.</p>
<p>And this can be duplicated throughout all of the clicking button codes, and set up. Just add and delete the amounts of items being removed and replaced by bars. Be sure to change your level requirement, ores, bars, and Exp gained.</p>
<p>In my game coal has been implemented into the frey where it belongs. But as some would know you cannot have 80 coal in your inventory to smelt the 10 rune ores (requires 8 coal per bar) And of course I do not wish to give all the secrets away <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> But this will certainly make anyone who hates smithing one bar at a time much happier. Also you can remove the old crappy smelting codes that come with most all Delta servers. I reduced almost 25 codes to this singular code in my client by doing this. It is more effective, cleaner, and works a lot better. As soon as I can figure out the X amount, I will add it.</p>
