    <description>goddamn..
i know this is off topic and all this stuff but seriously this needs to be addressed.
he&#39;s such a goddamn fag. i think EVERYBODY on here (excluding all the other immature obese 8 year olds) FUCKING HATES HIM. all he does is flame, and when he posts&#39; it&#39;s nothing but shit. (well.. a small number are decent..)
goddamn i cant even express in words how fucking gay he is. he needs to get p90x (fitness program) and grow the fuck up.
ooo but in order to make a valid topic, how do i make a loop in blender? like in the trigger loop in a gun.
do i just extrude the faces that follow it and then join verticies? or what..

but seriously H1.. get a fucking like you fat fuck (hahaha and now he&#39;s gunna retaliate with something like ooo you need to grow up i mean look at you modeling. well i&#39;m going to collage for it you can go suck your dads dick xD (he totally does) then he&#39;s gunna say like oo your models suck worse than mine.. well no. they dont you moron. then he&#39;s gunna say that ooo i&#39;m not fat. and while you may not be, that everybody on here has that image of you in there head so dont even fight it xD)

now i am aware that mostly all of this MAY OR MAY NOT be true, and it&#39;s all my opinion (well and at least 83% of major people on here xD) , he&#39;s an issue to the forum.

cj or dylan i know you agree with at least something on this so i would a appreciate very much if you didnt delete this post claiming a violation of the TOS, because i know this.
and i know you two are aware of this fuck head ruining everything on here.

oo and one more thing., some of you people who might have even an ounce of respect will claim that i did this just to start a flame war (more like engulf the whole planet in flames,). i did.   i go to read topics and it&#39;s always a flame war between h1 and everyone else, and i&#39;m tired of that. get it all out of your system here :P</description>
