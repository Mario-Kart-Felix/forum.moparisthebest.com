    <title>Computer died?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-died/434527</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve had an old Dell Optiplex 620 running for about 3 years straight now (powered on probably 98% of the time with my irc and servers :&gt;), and it finally died. My brother said he was watching a video, then the video froze (but the audio continued) so he shut it down. When he tried to turn it back on, it wouldn&#39;t power on at all. We dusted it, let it cool down, still wont turn on. The little LED in the case is on, so it&#39;s receiving power (not sure if that means the power adapter is working properly though?) 

Any ideas? My dad thinks it&#39;s the power supply/adapter, any other ideas? Don&#39;t want to buy a new one and then have it not be the issue.

If we can&#39;t fix it it&#39;s not a big deal, I&#39;d just like to possibly be able to save it.</description>
