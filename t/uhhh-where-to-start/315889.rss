    <title>Uhhh..where to start?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/uhhh-where-to-start/315889</link>
    <description>I have some experence hosting things (Tribes, being one of them)
And editing/tinking with things.
But I have NO idea where to even start on runescape hosting.

There are some posts that start with [508] So..does that patch/client only work with a specfic runescape type?

Basically I would like a RS client/serverside thing where all the Rs files are open for editing.  (such as, sprites, models, npc scripts etc)
I already read the how to make a model tut, so no real issue there but still. It seems as though I almost end up downloading like 3-4 different things for different clients or something and all of it is somehow confusing.
Is there anything with some scripts and stuff already made? So I can get how they work by messing around with them? (As far as I have seen, there are no scripts on RS when you first download the server hosting thing.)  I work best when I have something to take appart to see how it works.</description>

<p>Also, so…if 317’s are larger, does that mean there is more to mess around with/edit?<br>
or is 317’s just ‘uncompressed’?</p>

              <p>Thanks guys.<br>
I’ll wait a bit more for feedback though,  I want to see if anyone else agrees for warscape before I download something. xD<br>
EDIT:<br>
I keep hearing about a 317 client?  What is this?/where can I get it? (I googled, and searched here, I find peoples servers, not the client itself)<br>
What is the difference between that and a 508?</p>

              <p>yu wont find anything like that. Your best chances are to download a source and download a blank source. Then create a server from that testing if you wanna be technical.</p>
<p>But if your new to rsps servers then forget that completely because millions have tried with this type crap and most have failed. So just download a source/client and code it and call it a day. Or study the tutorial sections. Those are your only chances otherwise it wont work.</p>
