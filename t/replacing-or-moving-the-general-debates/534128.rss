    <title>Replacing or moving the General Debates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/replacing-or-moving-the-general-debates/534128</link>
    <description>Personally I don&#39;t see the reason to have two boards which have very little difference serving the same purpose. I see where people would want every day discussions separate towards something like just say, the meaning of life. I believe we could easily throw in a child board under the Intellectual Discussions and Debates topic for General Debates so that we can make some room for something else, by something else I was thinking something along the lines of a community vote and/or suggestion. Due to recent opinions on the direction of the forum I believe it&#39;s time for a new board, something new and fresh to the community to keep its lively hood.

A few wants for boards I&#39;ve seen around the forums are:
 1. Music Board
 2. Photography Board
 3. Arts Board
 4. Blog Board (a place for the people to post personal things, somewhat like a social network e.g. irl pictures, new toys/games/phones etc.)
 5. Fitness Board
 6. Birthday Board

I don&#39;t know, just something general. These are probably horrible suggestions but maybe you guys can come up with something better?

Maybe if the staff decide to have a community vote it will give the people a chance to reminisce and discuss together on what will be best to choose and what will they use and benefit from out of the chosen poll from the staff. Maybe this suggestion has purpose? Maybe it&#39;s completely useless and doesn&#39;t bother anyone? Would like to see some input on this.</description>

<p>So really it’s merging the two debate topics and renaming the Graphics section to Media? It sounds like a good plan, you gmods really know how to work that magic.</p>

</aside>
<p>What would happen to the child boards? Would they be merged into one board?</p>
<p>As for the suggestion, I’m all for a music board as I’ve said on previous topics. As for a general media board, I’d be in support of that as well.</p>

<p>most of these boards will just water down the posts even more.</p>

The topic of a debate should decide what type of debate it’ll be, not a board. I don’t really see the need for an arts board, there’s a graphics section already which seems to do nicely.
