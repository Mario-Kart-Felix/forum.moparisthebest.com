    <title>How to dump your minecraft map to google maps using c10t</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-dump-your-minecraft-map-to-google-maps-using-c10t/391780</link>
    <description>Just wanted to help people out who want their maps to be fully viewable using the google maps interface.
This tutorial is based off the assumption that you are already pretty confident with the operating system you are using whether its windows or linux (c10t is not available on mac osx).

[b]Download c10t mapper[/b]
Download whatever is suitable for you from:
http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=33803

If you&#39;re lazy, at the time of writing these are the downloads avaliable:

[ul][li][url=http://toolchain.eu/minecraft/c10t/releases/c10t-1.7-linux-x86.tar.gz]Linux 32 bit[/url][/li]
[li][url=http://toolchain.eu/minecraft/c10t/releases/c10t-1.7-linux-x86_64.tar.gz]Linux 64 bit[/url[/li]
[li][url=http://toolchain.eu/minecraft/c10t/releases/c10t-1.7-windows-x86.zip]Windows 32 bit[/url][/li]
[li][url=http://toolchain.eu/minecraft/c10t/releases/c10t-1.7-windows-x86_64.zip]Windows 64 bit[/url][/li][/ul]






[b]Linux[/b]
Extract the gzip tarball using whatever method you wish you use. If you&#39;re on the command line or are unsure how to extract simply run the following:
[code]tar -xf c10t-1.7-linux-x86.tar.gz[/code]
It&#39;s likely you&#39;ll have to change this to match the path and name of the tarball.

Once you have navigated to the folder using a file manager or the &quot;cd&quot; command copy &quot;c10t&quot; to the &quot;google-api&quot; folder.
Once again, if you don&#39;t understand just run:
[code]cp c10t google-api/[/code]

You&#39;ll need a directory to store all the map information. If you are running c10t on a webserver then make a suitable directory such as &quot;map&quot; in your web folder. You can easily create a folder with the &quot;mkdir&quot; command.

You&#39;re all set to go now, to run the mapper you must use the following syntax:
[code]sh google-api -w &lt;world&gt; -o &lt;output&gt; [options][/code]

example, to generate a birds eye view map located in /minecraft/server/map/ to /webserver/map you would run to following:
[code]sh google-api -w /minecraft/server/map -o /webserver/map[/code]
To view this map, just open /webserver/map/index.html in your web browser.







[b]Windows[/b]
Use you&#39;re proffered compression program (most people use WinRAR) to unzip the c10t zip file.

Navigate to the folder that you&#39;ve just extracted using windows explorer and copy and paste &quot;c10t.exe&quot; into the &quot;google-api&quot; folder.

Create a folder where you want the map to be stored. If you are running a web server on the machine feel free to create a folder in your web directory like &quot;map&quot;.

There are two methods to run the mapper, either using powershell or php. Since the php route is easier I will walk-through that. You must first install [url=http://windows.php.net/download/]php[/url] and then make sure that php.exe is in your path (I&#39;m not going to go into details of how as it is just like setting jdk path).

Now create a batch script in the &quot;google-api&quot; folder with the following
[code]php google-api.php [world path]* [image output directory]*[/code]
[word path] being the path where your map is stored
[image output directory] being the folder where you wish the map to be stored (which you just created)

example, if you wanted to dump C:/Documents and Settings/lol/minecraft/World1 to the folder C:/mymap you would:
[code]php google-api.php &quot;C:/Documents and Settings/lol/minecraft/World1&quot; &quot;C:/mymap&quot;[/code]

You can now test out your map by opening map.html in your output folder.

Ye so that&#39;s all I can be bothered to write about now. There is so much more to explain such as extra options of c10t (like isometric view) and how to auto update the map using cron jobs etc. peace out dawgsss.</description>

<p>Yes, that’s exactly what happened, I’ll probably get to take a look at it when I complete the 1.7 upgrade.</p>
