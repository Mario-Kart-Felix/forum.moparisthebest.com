    <description>I need more help on my server and I&#39;m starting to get p-oed! Okay now things I am p-oed about:

[s] 1. When I type in this code for membership:
I save it right? and compile(just in case), well after i do that i go onto my server, onto the account i am making a member, and it says for me: &quot;You are a member, and an admin.&quot;, but at the top it says You are not a member, and when i try to equip member items it says that i need to be member, and when i go onto that player in the Characters folder, and click on me it goes back to this:
 :( I NEED HELP ON FIXING THIS PLZ DRIVIN&#39; ME NUTS! [/s] [size=18pt]THATS ALL FIXED THX TO Bangali boy![/size]

2. I have edited and went through 2 times on editing the NPC talk in NPCHandler.java and after that i save, compile and have even restarted the Runserver.bat thing, when i go on the server it still says the Dialogue it has had before but i go into NPCHandler.java and everything is the same as it was, so I am confused! PLZ HELP

3. I have edited the starting outfit in Player.java, when I save compile, etc... i start a new acc, when i go on there is the original outfit, like i said things arent being transfered, its pissin&#39; me off! But plz help   :(

Thanks for taking your time for reading this! That&#39;s it for now, and ANY info would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks again,

              <p>Check one of the folders and see if there’s a .txt file named Members.<br>
Add you name in there.<br>
OR…<br>
Either your saving is messed up (Mostly Czar).</p>
<p>Or, you can do this.<br>
Change your Member rights to “4”.</p>
<p>If that dosen’t work, refresh your brower/client.<br>
Then if that dosen’t work, take out Membership Czar way, and make Devolution way.</p>
