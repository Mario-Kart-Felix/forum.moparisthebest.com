    <title>Player.java - pBeard help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-java-pbeard-help/299067</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever posted a topic in this section before.  :rolleyes:

But anyway, i&#39;ve had this little annoyance for a long time, on my server, my player chins do not appear, i&#39;ve gone into a little experimenting, and it seems when i change this code, through trial and error, i end up with some different results, for example, whole head disappears, just chin appears, and the head, uh, spasms.

Anyway, here&#39;s the segment of code, in Player.java.
[code]
            if (!Item4.isFullHelm(playerEquipment[playerHat])
                    &amp;&amp; !Item4.isFullMask(playerEquipment[playerHat])) {
                playerProps.writeWord(0x100 + pHead); // head
            } else {
                playerProps.writeByte(0);
            }
[/code]

This bit, playerProps.writeWord(0x100 + pHead);, is what i have been using trial and error on.

I&#39;ve used such code as:
[code]
0x100 + pHead + pBeard
[/code]

[code]
0x200 + pHead + pBeard
[/code]

[code]
pHead + pBeard
[/code]

And so on, basically i&#39;ve tried every combination.

What i need to know is, uh, what does &#39;0x100&#39; actually mean?
And, basically, how i would go about fixing it.


If you really don&#39;t know what i&#39;m on about, here, notice, no chin/beard.
