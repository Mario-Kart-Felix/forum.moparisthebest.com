    <title>A good way to make an autoing &quot;engine&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-good-way-to-make-an-autoing-engine/15418</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve gotten to load the client through my own class.

Now, im thinking on what kind of autoing &quot;engine&quot; I should make.


First, I thought about just forcing fake events trhough stuff like keyPressed and mouseMoved and stuff.

Then, I thought maybe I could access variables inside the client and do something with that. 

Anyone got some ideas? All help will be appreciated.

*BTW This is wit the current RSClient.*</description>

Do not touch the client. Write accessor methods for (or reflect) things like NPC/object position. Use this data in your cheating program (located outside the client threads) to control input methods.

              <p>well the a number of things you must consider, seperate threads or running in the rs thread, design your solutions around this.</p>
<p>If you can find things in the client let me know that is what i could use.  As for input i can provide a full input solution.</p>
