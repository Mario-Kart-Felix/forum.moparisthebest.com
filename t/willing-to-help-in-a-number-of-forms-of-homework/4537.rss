    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/willing-to-help-in-a-number-of-forms-of-homework/4537</link>
    <description>I tutor at our school and have found my own abilities dramatically increase when I attempt to explain concepts to others and I simply love challenges so post here for help.

I&#39;ve completed AP Biology, AP Chemistry, Calculus I, Trigonometry, Geometry, Algebra II (all the basic math stuff) and am willing to help you with some of your papers whether they be philosophical, political, introspective or simple summaries and responses. 

Feel free to post here at your leisure and message me on AIM at aznph8playa if I&#39;m not online here. Don&#39;t be afraid to message if I appear offline, I&#39;m often invisible.

Edit: I realize there are other topics out there similar to this one but for my own purposes, it would be easiest for me to have a topic that I&#39;ve started. Thanks and happy homeworking.</description>

<p>A dude has 5 red cards numbered 1 - 5 and four blue cards numered 3 - 6. He stacks the cards so that the colors alternate and so that the number on each red card divides evenly into the number on each neighboring blue card. What is the sum of the numbers on the middle three cards???[/quote]<br>
Seeing as there are only 9 cards, the quickest method maybe to do a little guesstimation.<br>
Since each blue card must be divisible to its neighbors, it’s safe to assume that we want the largest red numbers on the end so that they will only be in contact with one blue card. With this in mind I’ll give it a shot. r = red; b = blue</p>
<ol>
<li>5’s will have to be next to each other since only thing divisible by 5 between 3 and 6 is… 5!<br>
r5 b5</li>
<li>Next to the blue 5 will need to be a 1 since the ony other number between 1-5 that 5 is divisble by is 1.<br>
r5 b5 r1</li>
<li>Now we’ll jump to the other end of the stack.<br>
r5 b5 r1                     _</li>
<li>We’ll start with the second largest red number which is 4<br>
r5 b5 r1                     r4</li>
<li>Again, only thing between 3-6 that is divisible by 4 is… 4<br>
r5 b5 r1                 b4 r4</li>
<li>Now since we’ve already used the r4, our only option for the card left of b4 is r2.<br>
r5 b5 r1             r2 b4 r4<br>
Let’s see what we have left:<br>
Red:<span class="bbcode-s">1,2,</span>3,<span class="bbcode-s">4,5</span>Blue: 3,<span class="bbcode-s">4,5,</span>6</li>
<li>Out of our remaining 3 and 6, only 6 is divisble by 2 so we place our b6 next to our r2.<br>
r5 b5 r1         b6 r2 b4 r4</li>
<li>6 is also divisble by 3 and so r3 is next to the b6<br>
r5 b5 r1      r3 b6 r2 b4 r4</li>
<li>And finally, only 3 is remaining and thus it fills the last position.<br>
r5 b5 r1 b3 r3 b6 r2 b4 r4</li>
<li>Adding up 3,3 and 6 we get a final answer of 12.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Let n be a 5-digit number, and let q and r be the quotient and remainder respictively, when n is divided by 100. For how many values of n is q + r divisble by 11?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wow interesting problem… First thing I think to do is create algebric equations.<br>
Our number n can also be represented in terms of its seperate digits: ab,cde<br>
If we were to divide ab,cde by 100, q would equal abc and r would equal de.<br>
q = abc = a<em>100+b</em>10+c<br>
r = de = d<em>10+e<br>
We can get this by looking at the individual place holders<br>
q+r = a</em>100+b<em>10+d</em>10+c+e = a<em>100+(b+d)<em>10+(c+e)<em>1<br>
Now that we have some concept of what we’ll be getting from q and r we should look at mulitples of 11.<br>
11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99<br>
121, 132, 143, 154, 165, 176, 187, 198, 209, 220, 231, 242, 253, 264, 275, 286, 297, 308, 319, 330, 341, 352, 363, 374, 385, 396, 407, 418, 429, 440, 451, 462, 473, 484, 495, 506, 517, 528, 539, 550, 561, 572, 583, 594, 605, 616, 627, 638, 649, 660, 671, 682, 693, 704, 715, 726, 737, 748, 759, 770, 781, 792, 803, 814, 825, 836, 847, 858, 869, 880, 891, 902, 913, 924, 935, 946, 957, 968, 979, 990<br>
Since n is a 5 digit number, a must be greater than 0 and less than 10, thus the first 9 multiples of 11 need not be considered and we may stop at 990.<br>
After realizing this, we must look at all combinations of a,b,c,d and e that will cause the expression a</em>100+(b+d)<em>10+c+e to equal any of the above numbers.<br>
To do so, look at each digit individually and consider the possibilities. For example:<br>
121 = 1</em>100+2</em>10+1; a = 1; b+d = 2; c+e=1<br>
There is only one possibility for the first equation:<br>
1) a = 1<br>
b+d = 2 can occur in 3 ways:<br>
1) b = 1 and d = 1;        2) b = 0; d = 2;        3) b = 2; d = 0;<br>
c+e can also occur in 2 ways:<br>
1) c = 0; e = 1;             2) c = 1; e = 0;<br>
Thus there are 6 possibilities: 3</em>2 = 6 (the total number of pairings possible for each digit).<br>
To calculate the final answer, you would have to go through each number and do this. Once you’ve looked at the possible pairings for each digit, it will become quick.<br>
You know that for 1 there are two possibilities when considering 2 numbers, 3 for 2 and you can easily figure out the rest.<br>
I hope that helped.</p>
<p>Edit: After giving it a little thought I realized that the number of combinations that can be used to form any number from the sum of two others numbers is simply n+1. For example, there are 6 different ways to have a sum of 5 from only two numbers if order matters:<br>
0,5; 5,0; 1,4; 4,1; 2,3; 3,2.<br>
Since I have so much time on my hands, I went ahead and made a java code to count it up for you:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">class Solved{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int totalcombos = 0;
		int tensdigit, onesdigit;
		for (int i = 11; i&lt;=90; i++){        //Going from 121 to 990
			tensdigit = ((11*i)%100)/10; //Finds tens digit
			onesdigit = 11*i%10;	     //Finds ones digit
			totalcombos = totalcombos + (tensdigit+1)*(onesdigit+1);
		} //Keeps track of the number of combos^
		System.out.println(totalcombos);
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>My output was 2308. I hope that helped as well.</p>
