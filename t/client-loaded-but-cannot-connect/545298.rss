    <title>Client loaded, but cannot connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-loaded-but-cannot-connect/545298</link>
    <description>Ok, so I updated my client, all I did was change the name of the server because i miss spelled it in loader.java, and then i re jarred it because the co owner was having some issues with invisible ground and maps and stuff..

So now, when I open the new jar file, and even the run.bat in the client folder, the client loads, and it comes to the login screen, then when i go to log in it says &quot;error connecting to server&quot;

If it was not connecting to the source on the vps then it would usually just stay at connecting to server 1%, so I am just wondering if anyone knows how i can fix this?

Thanks.</description>
