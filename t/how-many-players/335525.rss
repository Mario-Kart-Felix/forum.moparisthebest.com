    <title>How many players?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-many-players/335525</link>
    <description>I&#39;m about to buy an VPS from VPSland.com that one that costs 24$ every month. What does it mean by &quot;Price for 3 mth
pre-payment:
$23&quot; Is it 23$ for 3 months 24/7 hosting or am I wrong?
By the way, another question the one im about to buy has a RAM of 1040MB, Diskspace 10GB, Bandwidth 300GB how many players can it host withot lagging &amp; disconnecting?

Best/Regards,
Your Master</description>
