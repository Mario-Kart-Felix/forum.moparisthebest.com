    <title>[562] need a devo team for my server [562]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-need-a-devo-team-for-my-server-562/435016</link>
    <description>Ok guys, I am having a problem with my 562, i am new to 562&#39;s and I was wondering a few things, and i am sure that later on i will need a devo team later on.
Well what i am planning to do with a devo team is email with them on stuff i need help with, if i don&#39;t need help you want hear from me.
I will give you guys a coder rank and stuff. Only accepting 3 coders that actually know coding on a 562, Rs2hd.
What i will also need is a webclient that i can probably do by myself, but it would be better for a devo team to do that.
