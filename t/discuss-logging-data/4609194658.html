Relational databases have withstood the test of time thus far, but if you think all of the academics that contributed to research in that area are somehow less informed than yourself then you just go right ahead with your naive approach.</p>
<p>[me=Lothy]rolls his eyes[/me][/quote]Why not argue with some evidence or logic rather than an appeal to authority? Also, they have not withstood the test of time, and do not scale properly, which can be seen with the up-rise of NoSQL. You should probably look up when using a relational database is appropriate, because it is not, in this situation.</p>
<p>In this case, the data does not naturally fit the relational model, and there are not benefits to using it. You’ve also failed to address the time resolution issue, which makes your approach have almost no value in most cases, and completely worthless in some of the most needed areas.</p>

<p>What evidence would you like? I’m at work, so I’ll be quick about it and just list the shortcomings of flat file:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can’t query it in a structured manner (something you need to be able to do to analyse the data in a meaningful manner).</li>
<li>No ACID properties.</li>
<li>No concurrency (never mind scaling, which you mentioned that databases can’t do but actually can to quite an acceptable extent – what do you think powers financial transactions, given that the whole NoSQL movement is a new kid on the block).</li>
</ol>
<p>Databases have withstood the test of time. They see extensive use in most business applications, and have done so since before the 70s (which is when a lot of relational theory, such as database normalisation, started to mature).</p>
<p>Finally, an appeal to authority is only bad when used in a fallacious manner. Given that academics are actually a respectable authority, there is nothing wrong with simply writing off your argument as rubbish and referring you to theirs.<br>
EDIT: To clarify that, I’m not asserting a falsehood and appealing to academia as justification. I’m reiterating the academic status quo. Very different.</p>
<p>Anyway, read a book or go to university, or something.</p>

<p>Anyway, read a book or go to university, or something.[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you need to query? You’re comparing timings, consistencies, and total cycles. All of this needs to be sorted by player, and in order of occurrence. To create a baseline profile, you do the same thing for many users, and combine the profiles. Then, look for outliers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Searching for all occurrences of someone using an ore on a furnace makes no sense. Everything that you’re analyzing is context based.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>That’s not true…</li>
</ol>
<p>Atomicity - This can be easily implemented by writing it to a temp file first. Though, losing data for a day is not an issue, because you’re looking at trends over time, not individual instances.</p>
<p>Consistency - This is covered by the contracts of the classes used to do the actual IO.</p>
<p>Isolation - Nothing should, or ever will be done concurrently to the same file. Every player can have their own file for each day, and you can then do things concurrently at that level.</p>
<p>Durability - Again, we don’t need to concern ourselves with this, because once the data is written, it is never changing.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>How the hell do you figure there is no concurrency? Each individual file can be accessed concurrently, and all the data can be analyzed concurrently, though that has nothing to do with how the data is being stored.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, this is nothing like financial transactions, primarily because we’re not dealing with transactions. We’re dealing with chains of events, that have already happened, and looking for distinct patterns that differ from a ‘normal’ pattern.</p>
<p>Just because something is used a lot, and is the standard does not mean it is the best solution. It only means it’s the most common and standard way to do it. You’re arguing against coming up with a solution specifically designed around the problem, and instead trying to fit it into some model that does nothing but create more work and overhead.</p>
<p>How are academics a respectable authority on this specific problem? I’ve spent some time looking for papers on some techniques to catch bots in MMOs, and haven’t found much. The only thing I really found was how to create realistic mouse movements and some general techniques. Also, most event processing papers I’ve looked at don’t talk about many people doing the same thing, and those that do, don’t go into how one would look for anomalies in the way we need to.</p>
<p>So, unless you can find an expert on the matter, that is willing to chime in, then any appeal to authority is fallacious.</p>
<p>Also, you’ve still failed to address the time resolution issue…</p>
<p>BTW since when does reading a book or going to university teach you that you should always force your problem to fit a standard solution instead of using your set of tools to solve the problem? Your argument makes no sense, because they specifically make classes to expand your set of tools rather than to show you how to force problems to fit a standard solution.</p>

[/quote]The fact that yours may be “simple and generic” isn’t a valid reason to use it. Everybody knows appending to plaintext takes less time than to design an efficient relational model.[/quote]My whole point is that a relational model offers absolutely no benefit.</p>
<p>Show me an query that can get all events from a single player, for a given day, in order of occurrence. Then, tell me its runtime complexity. After that, think about the runtime complexity of doing it where you have each day as its own folder, and each user having their own file for the day, already sorted in order of occurrence.</p>
<p>The reason I’m choosing this specific task is because that is going to be the most common task, by far.</p>

The main advantage is that over the duration of the fight you get more casts, and you can focus on other things. If you’re doing other things while autocasting, then you’ll be caught. If you have a substantial number of casts compared to others you’ll be caught.</p>
<p>Also, if they have to simulate mouse movements, then the huge advantage of being able to switch or whatever + cast is gone.</p>

<p>All three of your primary points are completely wrong, and your solution still has major issues that make it useless.</p>
<p>In fact, looking at your argument again, it seems like you just googled “flat file vs relational database” and used a completely uneducated response.  Instead you should have looked at the actual problem, and used intelligent responses to evaluate the merits of each.</p>
<blockquote>It depends entirely on the domain-specific application needs. A lot of times direct text file/binary files access can be extremely fast, efficient, as well as providing you all the file access capabilities of your OS's file system.
<p>Furthermore, your programming language most likely already has a built-in module (or is easy to make one) for specific parsing.</p>
<p>If what you need is many appends (INSERTS?) and sequential/few access little/no concurrency, files are the way to go.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when your requirements for concurrency, non-sequential reading/writing, atomicity, atomic permissions, your data is relational by the nature etc., you will be better off with a relational or OO database.</p>
<p>There is a lot that can be accomplished with SQLite3, which is extremely light (under 300kb), ACID compliant, written in C/C++, and highly ubiquitous (if it isn’t already included in your programming language -for example Python-, there is surely one available). It can be useful even on db files as big as 1GB, possible more.</p>
<p>If your requirements where bigger, there wouldn’t even be a discussion, go for a full-blown RDBMS.</p>

<blockquote>Reading a flat file is extremely fast for small files... the performance advantages of databases come when you attempt to seek specific data. If you're just grabbing a specific file (say, based on filename: msg_1.txt, msg_2.txt, etc) you're going to be better off with a flatfile system.

<p>Sometimes you need things to be humanly readable at the database level. For example lets say your script to parse the binary data from the database had a bug and you had been trying to locate it you could not easily read the table details you would have to spend time considering how to manually read the payload.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>See my attached university transcript for my official qualification.<br>
Additionally, see the little spiel about me here: <a href="http://devfu.com.au/about.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://devfu.com.au/about.php</a></p>
<p>There’s nothing to retract. Truth be told, only reason 1 (the ability to query the data in a structured manner) was required to justify my approach. Either you misunderstand the power that SQL provides when it comes to data analysis, or you lack the skills to implement such a solution. In any case, more fool you.<br>
The ability to query the data and the ability to make use of any logged information (which will be substantial, by the way) are inextricably linked.</p>
<p>On another note, the fact that you think my solution is too much work but are prepared to implement ACID properties as part of your own solution is laughable. You clearly underestimate just how much work goes into implementing certain features.</p>
<p>tl;dr: The only ‘shortcoming’ you’ve identified with my solution is that it belongs in your too hard basket. Whatever, I’m not surprised. This community is filled with plebs.<br>
But don’t expect me to regurgitate a book’s worth of text that you can find elsewhere, on your own, addressing things such as statistical analysis, relational theory, business intelligence and OLAP, etc.</p>
<p>Oh, and<br>
