[/quote]Yeah can’t let him loveing “get away” with that! He clearly said he doesn’t want to waste his time so why would you think to respond to that? It’s like you write the posts ahead of time and then got disappointed that he didn’t want to argue anymore but you posted it anyway.<br>

<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>See my attached university transcript for my official qualification.<br>
Additionally, see the little spiel about me here: <a href="http://devfu.com.au/about.php%5B/quote%5DThere" rel="nofollow noopener">http://devfu.com.au/about.php[/quote]There</a> is really only relevant class, and you got a 66% in it. That is embarrassing, not something to brag about. Also, that looks like it’s the equivalent of a vocational degree.</p>
<p>I’ve taken 3 CS classes (mind you, I have a full time job, I’m a part-time student, and I’m not only taking CS classes) and gotten above a 90% in all of them. I also took discrete mathematics, which looks like you dropped for whatever reason. BTW I got above a 90% in that class too, but to be fair, it was barely above 90%.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:39, topic:460919”]There’s nothing to retract. Truth be told, only reason 1 (the ability to query the data in a structured manner) was required to justify my approach. Either you misunderstand the power that SQL provides when it comes to data analysis, or you lack the skills to implement such a solution. In any case, more fool you.<br>
The ability to query the data and the ability to make use of any logged information (which will be substantial, by the way) are inextricably linked.[/quote]The power of querying is null and void in this situation, because you are looking at chains of events. You’ll be making querying things, that will take ages to complete, just to get the data in the way I’m storing it in.</p>
<p>Also, you can analyze it just fine, and more efficiently using my solution. Huge log files per player, per day? No problem, just iterate over it so you don’t need it all in memory. Want to analyze multiple players over multiple days concurrently? No problem, each player has their own file, for each day. Want to quickly check an individual player for a section of a day? No problem, you don’t need to do a full table scan, sort by date, and then filter out every other day that you don’t care about. You can simply jump to the day and player, then check the times of each entry there. Tired of re-writing queries that do similar things? Well, then create your own DSL and use composition to create complex queries.</p>
<p>In short, you’ll be doing full table scans, cross-referencing keys, running sorting algorithms on large data sets, and so on, while I am just reading pre-sorted data from a flat file.</p>
<p>Also, looking for instances of a particular type of packet is going to be completely useless, which is the place where SQL beats flat files, because we’re not looking directly at the actions, we’re looking at the context in which they occur. Your approach makes it much harder to look at things in context, and requires you to re-assemble the chain of events.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:39, topic:460919”]On another note, the fact that you think my solution is too much work but are prepared to implement ACID properties as part of your own solution is laughable. You clearly underestimate just how much work goes into implementing certain features.[/quote]Only one needs to be implemented, as the rest are already done or don’t matter, in this context. In the extremely rare event of losing data for a day, what difference does it make? We’re looking at trends over a long period of time. Sure, it’s nice to have them, but it’s not needed at all. Shit, I’m sure you could find something in the realm of NoSQL that would fit this data model nicely, that already has all the ACID properties.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:39, topic:460919”]tl;dr: The only ‘shortcoming’ you’ve identified with my solution is that it belongs in your too hard basket. Whatever, I’m not surprised. This community is filled with plebs.[/quote]It’s not too hard, it’s merely a waste of time and effort. It will be a gigantic pain in the ass to create a table for every single type of action (which there are more than there are packets), then implement a way to encode and decode them. Doing all that just so you have to create queries that re-build the chain of events, and basically have to reconstruct the natural order of things is just plain retarded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I’ve stated numerous times that the time resolution, of your solution, is unacceptable. You’ve come up with absolutely nothing to solve the problem.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:39, topic:460919”]But don’t expect me to regurgitate a book’s worth of text that you can find elsewhere, on your own, addressing things such as statistical analysis, relational theory, business intelligence and OLAP, etc.[/quote]I see no statistical analysis classes on your transcript, actually the only math class you were going to take seems to be dropped, and based on your grades, I doubt independent study of it would be of any use…</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:39, topic:460919”]Oh, and<br>
<img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/26723760.jpg" alt width="" height="">[/quote]Why would I respect someone who averages less than 75% in their classes? Having grades that low is disgraceful, especially when you have classes like intro to guitar…</p>
<p>P.S. I’m not taking the classes for credit, so I can’t just show you my transcripts. I’d have to go in to get a hard-copy of my classes and grades.</p>

INFT 2040 Database Management Systems 10 <span class="bbcode-b">66</span> C 10</p>
<p>Pretty much every university here requires math classes, gen eds, and so on, not just the classes specific to your major. The only places here that don’t are vocational schools.</p>
<p>I’m taking classes at my local community college, that would transfer to universities, provided I was taking them for credit, such as University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Chicago, University of Illinois Chicago, IIT, and pretty much any university in Illinois. All of those listed are in the top 100 for CS AFAIK. The first is in the top 5.</p>
<p>Also, there are plenty of people who have a 4.0 GPA (90% or better in all classes)… Though, I didn’t do so well in some of my other classes and I’m right around a 3.2 GPA, which I still consider bad.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:42, topic:460919”]EDIT:<br>

Databases use B+ trees, which are typically O(log n + k) performance… unless you don’t employ any indices, there is no full table scan.[/quote]You’re the one that keeps saying that it would be useful to search for instances of events. How are you going to index a table that contains someone smelting ores? And how will you keep the key from having a high cardinality?</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:42, topic:460919”]EDIT 2: NoSQL solutions have no ACID properties – that’s one of their biggest shortcomings.

Also, I never said it was easy to implement them all, I said the one that would be useful is fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>The whole point is you’re trying to make it out like if it doesn’t have all ACID properties it’s completely useless, when that is not the case. The whole notion of NoSQL rarely satisfying them all just supplies more evidence to my claims.</p>

Having the server record the time that an action occured as the time the packet was received is subject to network latency, and is ultimately no more accurate than the apparent downfall in my proposal.[/quote]Your time resolution is no smaller than 1 second, ever. You’re not even on the tick level. I also mentioned that my resolution was based on latency, and that it can be accounted for.</p>
<p>Also, it entirely depends on the exact way you’re analyzing it. There is actually a <a href="http://mll.csie.ntu.edu.tw/papers/bot_ident.pdf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">paper</a> that doesn’t rely on capturing the click times from the client side and factors in network latency into their analysis.</p>

So I didn’t graduate with distinction, but I’m content.[/quote]I was the only person to get an A in my discrete math class, out of 50+ (my professor was ranting about it, especially seeing I wasn’t even taking it for credit). Also, in general, CS classes there is a double hump, which is a pretty decent sized topic of discussion. And my grades where all at or above 98% in them, because I only made minor errors on exams and had perfect scores on all other assignments (mind you discrete math was not considered CS). Also, I’m pretty sure the reason most grades are inflated is because of extra credit, which was not offered in my CS classes.</p>
<p>Though, I’m not even going to defend the American higher education system, it’s a pile of shit, and I’ll willingly admit it. I’m simply stating that I’m getting near perfect scores in the entire class when I have classmates getting less than 50% total.</p>

        <p>I’m a little bit late to the discussion, I know (I havn’t been here since November, so I missed it). But here is what I have to say.</p>
<p>At a company where I worked, say 3 years ago, we logged all actions for players to log files on the local machine. There’s a reason for that. It’s much faster to log to files. There is also a greater risk logging to a database because of connectivity problems, especially if it’s on a remote machine. Then once logged, we had a parser and a transactional system for processing said logs and create statistical data that we inserted into a database. This statistical data was then shown on a local website we hosted. Sure, the data wasn’t 100% up-to-date, but that was no problem for us.</p>

        <p>If I remember it all correctly, we created a new folder each day. Then we had a separate file for each user in each folder (if they had been active during that day of course). So each file would probably not get too large. The folders that we were not currently writing to (that is, any folder with a date other than the date of today, so to speak) would be parsed, processed and saved to the database. This parsing, processing and database saving happened at the end of every day.</p>

[/quote]This is essentially what I proposed, but with a plan for keeping the statistics, so they don’t need to be redone.[/quote]Yep, I know that. I just wanted to give insight into how we, as a company in the industry, solved this problem. I noticed the flame war, in which one of your “opponents” (not saying any names), apparently talked about how a company would do it and how they would not. That triggered me to respond. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>If a remote database server goes down then you’re shit out of luck anyway. In such a situation the game should fail closed (i.e., boot everyone as soon as the failure is detected and deny new login attempts).<br>
A service of any kind should be fault-tolerant, but it shouldn’t pretend to be alright if something as integral as the database server goes down.</p>
<p>Obviously in industry you would have redundancy in the form of failover support, with the primary database using log-shipping to keep a secondary database server (for use in the event of primary server failure) up-to-date.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:53, topic:460919”]If a remote database server goes down then you’re shit out of luck anyway. In such a situation the game should fail closed (i.e., boot everyone as soon as the failure is detected and deny new login attempts).<br>
A service of any kind should be fault-tolerant, but it shouldn’t pretend to be alright if something as integral as the database server goes down.</p>
<p>Obviously in industry you would have redundancy in the form of failover support, with the primary database using log-shipping to keep a secondary database server (for use in the event of primary server failure) up-to-date.[/quote]You shouldn’t boot everyone… You should keep everyone logged in and just not allow new connections. Then, if it needs to shut down, store it locally and update it when the database comes back online.</p>
<p>Just because the database goes offline, doesn’t mean players that are currently experiencing the game should be interrupted and disallowed from continuing.</p>

        <p>Still sticking the square in the circle hole, I see. Your database should act as a single source of truth.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario. Three game servers, A, B, and C. For one reason or another, the NIC used for communicating with the database server on server A fails. Servers B and C are fine, and remain operational.<br>
Several shitty outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A player has played for half an hour after. They log out to take a piss and then try to login again. Failure. They go to another server, log in, and notice that they’ve lost the rare drop they had.</li>
<li>Despite losing the drop, they continue to play on the new server and acquire an inventory full of stuff before logging out again. You merge the logs from the server with the broken link back into the database – what items does the player now hold?</li>
</ol>
<p>Never mind the loss of faith from players that such a scenario can result in. Have you considered the technical difficulty in merging the data back? Which data takes precedence?<br>
Robust means fault tolerant, not fault masking. A cluster failure (single database server cluster, in this case, I guess) is catastrophic, and there’s no shame in shutting the service down when a catastrophic failure occurs. You do everybody a disservice by doing it any other way - the players who perhaps lost their time, and the poor bastard who has to make the public apology.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, object isn’t necessarily right about logging being inherently faster. If you’re writing a log file to its own dedicated physical disk then yeah, the writes are purely sequential (so there’s no seek) – as long as you pre-allocate the log file as one massive block on disk to avoid fragmentation.<br>
However if the disk is being used for other IO, and that other IO is heavy enough, then you really aren’t any better off. You’ll potentially wind up with disk thrashing occurring.</p>
<p>So really, log writing isn’t necessarily, and certainly not always, faster. You need to design the system so that it has sufficient IO capacity.</p>

        <p>If you have the logs, there will not be a precedence problem. All actions have a timestamp. No action should depend on the presence of another action. So you could merge them in the correct order.</p>

        <p>Okay, so another scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>Player A sells an item to Player B on server A (which has lost connection to the database server).</li>
<li>Player B remains on server A until the database connection is fixed. In the meantime, Player A logs out, logs in to server B, and sells the whip again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which trade is honoured? Two whips are now in the game and Player A has twice the gold.</p>
<p>There are probably other scenarios that are just as likely to cause problems. I’ll reiterate again: If your database goes down, the last thing you should do is continue to operate as if nothing is wrong.</p>

        <p>In RuneScape (2) you will have to wait a little while before being able to log in to a new server. At least, it was like that last time I logged in. So, during that time, they may transfer all log entries for a player, that has not yet been updated to the database. Just one way to do it. Or, do not allow a player in on any server once that happens, like you said yourself. I personally never said that was a bad way.</p>
<p>Maybe the two-phase commit protocol could be used.</p>

What would happen (if you didn’t even account for this possibility), is that they wouldn’t be allowed into one of the functioning servers, because server A has not released the player yet, seeing it can’t communicate with the database.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, it isn’t set up so servers A, B, and C all connect to the database. They all connect to the login server, which is the only thing that should be connecting to the database. So, if the login server loses connection, the behavior is consistent. If one of the servers loses connection to the login server, the player is still marked as logged in and the above reasoning still applies.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:55, topic:460919”]Never mind the loss of faith from players that such a scenario can result in. Have you considered the technical difficulty in merging the data back? Which data takes precedence?[/quote]There isn’t a difficulty, because the problem can never occur…</p>

You’re allowing players to continue, while still having their progress saved. That is, you’re still providing your service to as many people, for as long as possible without interrupting their experience. Also, you’re still wrongfully implying that players will lose their progress, when I explicitly stated how that should be dealt with… Go back and read my post.</p>
