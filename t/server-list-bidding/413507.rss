    <title>Server list bidding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-list-bidding/413507</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking at the bidding, as we all know, the bidding doesn&#39;t close until the 10th, but I see you guys have bids of roughly $100 to $200. Now I ask, do you HONESTLY expect to get anything lower than 8th place with a bid of $200? Do you know why $200 doesn&#39;t get you even in the top 7 when it should? It&#39;s because people place high bids early on. All that does is jack the price up. All your doing is saying, well to get to the number one spot, the MINIMUM you need to win is $200, and that will only increase as people around the end of the bidding (7th or 8th day) will post up ridiculous bids of around $500, which will also only guarantee them a spot of only 6 or 5. I&#39;ve been on the number 2 spot before, so I know what I&#39;m talking about. Please stop posting bids in the 100s until the last 10 or so minutes of bidding, to ensure that the prices stay low and affordable for everyone, this will also ensure more people can afford to get on the top list in the first place, instead of seeing the same tired ass servers every month.

Thanks,

              <p>Why should there be a limit? Mopar is the one raking in the cash. If anything you’d be kinda disappointed at this topic. He’ll never admit it of course, but he is.</p>

              <p>I’m sure best bid will be $700+ this month again.<br>
Also, “Entrana” will bid at the end like $750+ xD</p>
<p>I might bid at the end too, or I might not at all, since it’s too expensive nowadays. There should be a limit or something lol</p>

<p>Edit:</p>
<p>It’s already at $400, and that will only get higher. Everyone that does that, clearly does not know how to bid…</p>

The first bid should only be like $500, not more…</p>
