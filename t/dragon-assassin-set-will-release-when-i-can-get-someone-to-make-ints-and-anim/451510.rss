    <description>I apologize for this new thread i actually had one of my plans canceled for today and decided to make it a personal day so i actually was doing this almost all day (off and on) this isn&#39;t the COMPLETED set as my title may have hinted im planning on making a complete set. xD and so to clear up any Questions im OCD in a way so all my things are organized and colors labeled. so here it is i hope you guys enjoy and soon im planning on releasing a template model for meta that i design almost all of my chest plates out of.And as for the color scheme its not related to Dharoks in any way. well it could be im not 100% stuck on the name  but enough of my worthless rambling. here it is ^^

              <p>Yea im doing so slight modifications plus boots. and im working on a cape. but ive never made a cape before so its sorda out of my range. and i already have the legs fixed on my V3 version. and as for the back of it im not going to add anything to the back because the cape will be good enough and plus theres only so much stuff that can go onto it without making it look trashy. but im thinking about tinkering with the colors a tad. idk if its going to Portray the NOBLE look i want so it may be more on the lines of an Assasin</p>

              <p>Very nice. I disagree that the back needs more stuff on it. It’s fine as is. Very nice color shading. Only things I don’t like is the leg looks a bit odd (the red one) and the gloves. Can’t picture how the gloves are gloves.</p>

              <p>I apologize for this new thread i actually had one of my plans canceled for today and decided to make it a personal day so i actually was doing this almost all day (off and on) this isn’t the COMPLETED set as my title may have hinted im planning on making a complete set. xD and so to clear up any Questions im OCD in a way so all my things are organized and colors labeled. so here it is i hope you guys enjoy and soon im planning on releasing a template model for meta that i design almost all of my chest plates out of.And as for the color scheme its not related to Dharoks in any way. well it could be im not 100% stuck on the name  but enough of my worthless rambling. here it is ^^<br>
