    <description>Basically mods and admins both have that old silver crown so the gold admin crown has dissappeared


[center]Basically i want to know how the donating icons work on a PI.
When i started the source it was
PlayerRights 1 = mod icon [MODICONS 0]
PlayerRights 2 = Admin icon [MODICONS 2]
PlayerRights 3 = Owner icon[MODICONS 3]
PlayerRights 4 = Donator icon icon,[MODICONS 4]

[font=times new roman]So basically i decided i would change the names of the spirites, Eg making MODICONS 0 -- &gt; mod icons 2, So a moderator would be playter rights 2 and so on so a donator would be player rights one.

I have no problem with that but when i switched them around it seems as if its messed up ?
IF i make myself player rights one its the correct donator icon but player rights 2 and 3 have the same icon for some reason, both of them get the mod crown however player rights 4 has the owner icon which is correct.
i have tried this several times by creating a backup and failed.
Looked over LOTS of sites for tutorials camt seem to find one for a PI base, Any help from you guys would be greatly appriceated.

If you want to help me over msn please add yash_runefx@hotmail.co.uk
