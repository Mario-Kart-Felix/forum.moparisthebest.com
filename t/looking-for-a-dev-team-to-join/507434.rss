    <description>Im looking to join a team of programmers/developers.
im not experienced in one particular area as i know server languages, here are some:

C++
Java
Web Dev ( Package of: HTML, CSS, XML, jQuery, JavaScript, Ajax, PHP, MySQL)
.NET (1.0 - 4.5)

My details are as follows:
Name: Kieran Devlin
Age: 16 *almost 17*
Nationality: British
Location: UK
Years programming: 6 or 7.

Main reason for joining a team: Just tired of coding alone. Also i want to see other peoples projects and idea&#39;s and help out any way i can :)

If you think you could use me, please message me on skype: exotiicdeath.
*Note: please dont add me if your just looking to start a team as im wanting to join an existing team.</description>

HTML isn’t?[/quote]<br>
For all intents and purposes HTML isn’t a programming language, HTML5 is closer to a programming language, for example it’s used in the creation of android apps but once again still isn’t a programming language, it’s still defined as a markup language :P.</p>

Naming languages isn’t going to get you very far.<br>
Show some tutorials you’ve written, past or current works, or if you don’t have access to any, use your programming skills to whip up some for us. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Otherwise, good luck finding a team.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well most of my big work is private or for personal use. but if you really want to see if i suggest messaging me on skype, i’d have no problem screen sharing.<br>
Also, il think you will find that this is what you would do in real life when you go for a job interview. you don’t show your future boss how good you can fly an airplane if your wanting to be a pilot. your CV will tell them your skills. So if you really want to see some proof of my work before you let me join, quite clearly your only a kiddi trying to get free developers. because any real dev team would let you work, if you false-claimed you could program then you would just get kicked out of the team. so i have no reason to lie about the skills i know because <span class="hashtag">#1</span> im not an immature ‘kiddi’ and <span class="hashtag">#2</span> it would be a huge waste of my time.[/quote]<br>
But you show papers, qualifications, and anything else pertaining to your applications that would help further influence your probability to be accepted into a team.<br>
This is just my opinion on the matter; as I said before, best of in luck finding a team.</p>
