    <title>Legal Client</title>

    <description>Occasionally people have rewritten servers from scratch, but has anyone rewritten a client from scratch?  That would be amazing if someone redesigned the world, had different looking NPCs, different weapons &amp; armour, etc.  Plus it would be legal to use that client!  If you know anyone is working on this or has done this, please send me a link to their thread. I would love to view their progress and possibly continue the project.
