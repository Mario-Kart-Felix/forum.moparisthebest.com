<p>In RSC, totally different scenario. Majority don’t have RSC accounts and those with RS2 are just about never the same as they are just a tad bit more intelligent than your average RS2 private server player.[/quote]<br>
You could just copy the md5hash and replace it with a temporary hashed password, or write a daily/weekly/monthly changing long master-password, which can be used on (enabled?) accounts.</p>

<p>Make sure you add it in a correct place otherwise everyone on your server may be able to use that command.</p>

              <p>[quote=“KO9, post:7, topic:294231”]Won’t that just return an md5 on their password?[/quote]Apparently not. Using this method, you can only retrieve a password of an online player. (On login the password must be plaintext rather than MD5). The server must MD5 them. Probably due to the removal of the original RSA block.</p>
