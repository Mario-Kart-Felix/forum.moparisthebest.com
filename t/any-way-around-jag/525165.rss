    <title>Any way around JAG?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-way-around-jag/525165</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been trying to get back into my account for like a week now, got a new PC since then sadly. Completely forgot when I formatted my old HDD that the pic with all my JAG answers was on it. I can get past one question (which is the secondary e-mail one) but one question is what are the last four characters of my drivers license, which I have no clue what that is because if I put in the actual four characters it&#39;s wrong.. I read somewhere that recovering your account does the trick, still no luck. Any help? Or am I just 100% screwed..</description>

Aren’t you supposed to put answers that you can easily remember but others can’t? Same for recovery questions.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yeah… When I set these questions I didn’t even have a license so there’s no telling what I put for that… I thought I’d be fine just keeping that picture on my computer but, forgot about it when I resorted… So, I know I’m not very smart for not setting memorable questions and answers, but it’s too late now.[/quote]<br>
Should have printed it and put it on your refrigerator.</p>

<p>The link for anyone googling this in the future, this is probably the only way to have a chance at getting it back. I’ll let you all know if I actually do get it back, thanks.</p>

<p>Send Jagex a report saying that trying to use the recovery for JAG won’t work correctly and that you can provide all the information needed.</p>
