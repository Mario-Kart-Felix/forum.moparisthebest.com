              <p>Rule 1:<br>
We are not anti-leech. If you respect our community and our ideas, feel free to ask questions and they will be kindly answered if you follow other rules. Answer to questions that others ask if you know the answer or remain silent!</p>
<p>Rule 2:<br>
We don’t talk about things we don’t know. This is an informative, not a misinformative community.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Rule 3:<br>
We don’t make spelling mistakes on purpose. We use “you” not “u”, we use “why” not “y” etc.</span></p>
<p>Rule 4:<br>
We don’t make posts that contain not useful information. Posts like “cool”, “lol”, “yeah” and “I agree” don’t contain anything useful for others. We are not fans of off topic, unless it contains something smart or funny. Most of things spammers find funny are actually not funny at all.</p>
<p>Rule 5:<br>
We don’t "Bum<code>p" posts on purpose or double post whether on purpose or by accident. If you want to add something to a post, edit your existing post. You are however, allowed to post in old topics if it is relevant to your problem. If you attempt to bum</code>p posts, or get around the word filter, you will be infracted.  If you do it by mistake, you will see the following message:</p>
<hr>
<h2>Bumping topics is against the Rules!</h2>
<p>Rule 6:<br>
We respect each other and other communities. We don’t flame each other or other communities. We don’t fight on the forums.</p>
<p>Rule 7:<br>
We don’t advertise other sites or communities unless we ask and receive permission to and from Moparisthebest. We don’t post links to sites that are not in safe sites list on <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> main page. We never advertise via the PM system.  Advertising through the PM system will result in a permanent ban.</p>
<p>Rule 8:<br>
We don’t care about post count alone. If someone has high post count and most of it is spam, we hate them. If someone has high post count with informative posts, we love them. The higher count, the more we hate/love them.</p>
<p>Rule 9:<br>
We never ask for “rep”.</p>
<p>Rule 10:<br>
DO NOT post or upload any copyrighted materials, ie deobs, clients or any other sort (however if you were to link to a file that was uploaded somewhere else or post code in the pasteBin, well, I would have no control over that right?  )</p>
<p>Rule 11:<br>
We do not sell anything on these forums with the exception of SCAR scripts.  SCAR Scripts must be verified, check the script sales board about that</p>
<p>Rule 12:<br>
We never have misleading links in our signatures or posts.  If a link says <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a>, we expect it to take us to <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>.  Misleading links anywhere will result in warnings, and in some cases bans.</p>
<p>Rule 13:<br>
Nothing to do with private servers belongs on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, use <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> for these things.</p>
<p>Rule 14:<br>
We only have 1 Forum account for <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> and <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a>.  If you get banned or have trouble logging in, email an admin, or get a friend to contact an admin.  Multiple accounts will result in Bans.</p>
<p>Rule 15:<br>
Do not talk about the Answers to the Quiz.  The purpose of it is to force new users to search for answers, and if it is discussed, searching the for answers will become very easy</p>
<p>Rule 16:<br>
Do not share forum accounts on either <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> or <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a>.  If we find out that you are sharing forum accounts with a family member of friend, you will be banned.  If you want to access the forums, please create your own account</p>
<p>And you have to edit it by item.java and Item.cfg</p>
