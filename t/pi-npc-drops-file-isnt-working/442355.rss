    <title>[PI]NPC drops file isn&#39;t working?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-npc-drops-file-isnt-working/442355</link>
    <description>I have figured out how to do everything else for this server and this even looks simple itself. The problem is that I edit the file but the npc doesn&#39;t drop the item on 100% or any. Then the second problem is that there are 2 files, NPCDrops.cfg and NPCDrops.tsm. When I couldn&#39;t figure it out after continuously testing I came here. It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s not even getting it&#39;s information of what the npc drops from either of them..but I&#39;ve searched the entire thing. Please help.

NPCDrops.cfg
[code]1	995
9	995
1624	3140	1249	1247	561	995
[/code]

NPCDrops.tsm
[code]#Man drops
1:1	995:100	554:100
#Guard drops
9:1	995:200	555:100
#general graardor
2550:40	829:1	391:2	385:2	564:50
[/code]

This is the original code, the only edit I did was when I was testing was with the Man. Also, even though you can see that in the code the Man is supposed to drop some items, he never does after death. It&#39;s always bones only. I searched for a guide before I came here and it said to edit the .tsm file, though, as I did that did not work.</description>

              <p>Thank you for your reply Skiire, Though, I have fixed the error. Testing the drops now. I will try and look around for this method which controls npc bone drops at some point, that sounds like it could be interesting to discover and if necessary…to edit.</p>

<p>You said: “I don’t even think that since the beginning the man wasn’t dropping anything except bones.” I’ve seen a lot of ways drops are handled within PI… I’ve seen a method that handled bone drops for most NPC’s. You’re going to have to figure out how your server handles items. Check out your NPCHandler class and more specifically the dropItems method.</p>
<p>P.S. I can vouch for the validity of Teamviewer, it’s a quite common tool and I would trust it, however use your better judgment when it comes to who you let have your information.</p>

Though, you don’t need to spell it out for me, as I’ve said, I already knew everything else on how to code the server(tabbing included of course…). Thank you for confirming that the .tsm is correct. If anyone could confirm your way of describing it. That’d be a better understanding.</p>
<p><code>
NPC ID:Drop rate

<p>Other than that, if anyone could please respond with a possible fix I’d be grateful. I’m not giving up, this is taking awhile to get possible fixes, I’m going back into testing.</p>

              <p>I had this few weeks back. IT was SO frustrating, the only way I fixed it is, I do a backup of my source before I edit any file that could possibly glitch up. So I copied all the NPC Drop files, and pasted them onto my good source, and it worked like a charm.</p>
<p>Yes, if you want to edit drops you use the .TSM file, but don’t forget, once you add a new item, you don’t press (SPACE), you press (TAB). From what I see, yours is not a TAB, it is about 3 TABS? Idk</p>
<p>example: let’s use your man file.</p>
<p><code>#Man drops
1:1(TAB)995:100(TAB)554:100(TAB)4151:100
#Guard drops
9:1(TAB)995:200(TAB)555:100
#general graardor
2550:40(TAB)829:1(TAB)391:2(TAB)385:2(TAB)564:50</code></p>
<p>With the tabs it should look something like: although i can’t press tab on here, im doing 3 spaces, to represent a tab. SO DONT GET CONFUSED. Also remember, the 1:1 at the begging is, 1 being the NPC code, and the :1 is being how many kills it takes to drop something constantly I believe. And the space between (1:1) and 995:100 should be MUCH greater than the space between (995:100) and (554:100) although it is still a tab, it separates it farther than the rest. So keep that in mind</p>
<p><code>#Man drops
1:1      995:100  554:100  4151:100
#Guard drops
9:1      995:200  555:100
#general graardor
2550:40        829:1   391:2  385:2   564:50</code></p>
<p>Hope I helped. Goodluck!</p>
