    <title>A P English</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-p-english/78741</link>
    <description>I am going into high school next year and i really want to be in A P English. To get in there you have to write an essay about it and why you want to be in there. I will appricate any help. Please dont write this for me, though, as this kinda of defeats the purpose. So if anyone in high school that is in AP or advanced english will tell me what a good essay might include, or anything else that would be helpfull would be great Thanks.</description>

<p>Anyway, AP English, is nothing big. Just harder material and you have to take a test at the end of the year. It’s easy for me, and I bet it will be easy for you. I love to write, so essays are a piece of cake for me.</p>

              <p>They really don’t care what you write, as long as it is well organized and well written. Organization is the biggest factor because that is what SAT and AP Lit readers are looking for. Content…meh</p>
<p>Make sure you have at least 5 paragraphs with the hour-glass format. Intro starts really broad and then explains what your 3 body paragraphs are about, then has a specific thesis. Move into your discussion, then the conclusion is the opposite of the intro. In the conclusions restate your thesis, reword the summary of your argument, and then give a last-sentence that ties everything together. Good last sentences usually tie into something happening today, or you can search <a href="http://brainyquotes.com" rel="nofollow noopener">brainyquotes.com</a> to find a nice quote relating to your topic.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you avoid the passive voice (The essay was written=passive/bad) (He wrote the essay=active/good)</p>
<p>Hope that helped</p>
