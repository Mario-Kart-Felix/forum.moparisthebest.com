    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/attack-all-npcs-in-certain-area/168303</link>
    <description>K so i want to make my newly added cannon attack all npcs and all players.
i have this currently:

[code]case 6: // Cannon Fire Case
if(actionTimer &lt;= 1){
if(cannonowner() == true){
attackPlayersWithin(60, 40, 10);
attackPlayersWithin(305, 40, 10);
attackPlayersWithin(567, 40, 10);
attackPlayersWithin(406, 40, 10);
sendMessage(&quot;You fire the cannon&quot;);
actionTimer = 20;
}
else 
{
sendMessage(&quot;Gtfo this aint urs&quot;);
}
else
{
sendMessage(&quot;Calm down!&quot;);
}[/code]

now i want to make it so it attacks only npcs and players around and the npcs would be only ones with attack option anyone help?

(i did make cannon work myself so its not too good)</description>
