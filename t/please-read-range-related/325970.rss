    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-read-range-related/325970</link>
    <description>Ok so I&#39;ve just about fixed everything on my server to my liking.. however my rune cbow and dbow hit shit! They dont hit over 30 with spec or with flat hit. Even when potted and in void or maxed range bonus. Ive set the range bonus givin to them to 10000 and it still doesnt change. ive done alot in my client.java too but none have worked so far. It&#39;s a 317 and help would be much appreciated..</description>
