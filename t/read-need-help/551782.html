<p>Yet other people can create their own methods of helping out the community and putting them onto this site, and users from this site are using them. That are outside of mopar. Look in the Server Help section people have the same problems, over and over, simple ones, if they can’t figure it out by people POSTING on THREADS telling them what to do and how to do it, is NOT helping them. People would much rather prefer actual help, and interaction, unfortunately MOPARSCAPE doesn’t alert my phone when I’m not sitting on my computer all day and I’m out having a life, or doing something, etc, being out and about get it? I get the alert, and they can get FAST help, and there’s other people I can put them in contact with depending on their needs. This is more than just a help section, we’re here to provide MOPARSCAPE users FAST, and EFFICIENT help with anything of their RSPS related needs, so there isn’t a bunch of the same threads because people can’t figure out how to fix, or they don’t get what they need from past threads. Or maybe their error or issue is a LITTLE different than anyone they could find, but they don’t understand it, we’re also here to help teach REAL Java, so there can be MORE real programmers in the MOPAR community. We’re not stealing users or anything, again we’re HELPING. This shouldn’t be a issue.</p>

<p>Think I haven’t seen the the notify button, it’s called DATA.<br>
Not everyone has free data and roam, anyway and we’re providing help through skype AND mopar, my arguement with Zymus was me being allowed to do this, which I am, and so is any other user…<br>
The fact is not everyone that is on the team, and will be helping users use mopar, and cba to daily. I don’t need to point anything out, like you say use the Search Engine, there’s actually quite a bit of them, their just not mapped out and put together good, so they didn’t raise barely any awareness. The J program was more better than this, and they had more resources, and more fluent programmers, but noone’s really trying to help people out like this currently, and it’s a better helping and teaching method. and will def help the community, and users who use this.</p>

<p>So hold on…<br>
You want people to contact you 24/7 using skype (Which takes a ton more DATA than an email) rather than monitoring a board… That seems very logical here.</p>
<blockquote>The fact is not everyone that is on the team, and will be helping users use mopar, and cba to daily.</blockquote>
That's not exactly our fault they're not on mopar. You're the one so "dedicated" to helping users, you should make your "team" all join mopar.
Why? It'd put a name out there for you. If everyone in your team had a signature that said you were part of said team, and actually helped people.. People would catch on.
<blockquote>I don't need to point anything out, like you say use the Search Engine, there's actually quite a bit of them, their just not mapped out and put together good, so they didn't raise barely any awareness</blockquote>
No, I want you to show me some of these services supposedly posted on mopar.. The reason you won't is because you can't.
<blockquote>The J program was more better than this, and they had more resources, and more fluent programmers, but noone's really trying to help people out like this currently, and it's a better helping and teaching method. and will def help the community, and users who use this.</blockquote>
"More better".
The Team-J Program didn't do very much. I personally would know as you can see my name is still on it. Honestly, there was no influx of people asking for help. I had about the exact same volume of people coming to me for help as per usual.
<p>All it does, and I mean this, is it puts a bunch of names together for people to look at.</p>
<p>If a person is not willing to help themselves, then they’re not going to get anything out of someone else helping them. Therefore, the way this site works is just fine for how help is provided. People have to <span class="bbcode-i">want</span> it enough to register an account, and then post a topic about that issue. Plus, that doesn’t mention the 670k topics on the website or the 4 million replies (Numbers based on post IDs. not actual statistics)…</p>
<p>And if you want to talk about “no one trying to help people out”. Go look in the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,48.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Server Help</a> section. I sure as hell don’t see you in any of the posts.</p>

<p>So hold on…<br>
You want people to contact you 24/7 using skype (Which takes a ton more DATA than an email) rather than monitoring a board… That seems very logical here.</p>

<p>That’s not exactly our fault they’re not on mopar. You’re the one so “dedicated” to helping users, you should make your “team” all join mopar.<br>

First, any notification sent by skype would use 3g/4g data or wifi if available. Skype is an instant messaging application. There’s no way you can use it without using up your precious data or a wifi connection. And the fact that you keep <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> pointing them out even though I’ve asked 3 times to is proving you can’t…</p>
<p>Lastly, Jack is not “your artist”:</p>

[5/31/2015 11:23:10 PM] Sk8rdude (Username): not sure if they're too hard, too easy, etc
[5/31/2015 11:23:29 PM] Jack Fisher: i'd make them a little bit easier, not too much though
