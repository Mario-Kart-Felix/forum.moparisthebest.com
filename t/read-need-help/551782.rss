Yet other people can create their own methods of helping out the community and putting them onto this site, and users from this site are using them. That are outside of mopar. Look in the Server Help section people have the same problems, over and over, simple ones, if they can&#39;t figure it out by people POSTING on THREADS telling them what to do and how to do it, is NOT helping them. People would much rather prefer actual help, and interaction, unfortunately MOPARSCAPE doesn&#39;t alert my phone when I&#39;m not sitting on my computer all day and I&#39;m out having a life, or doing something, etc, being out and about get it? I get the alert, and they can get FAST help, and there&#39;s other people I can put them in contact with depending on their needs. This is more than just a help section, we&#39;re here to provide MOPARSCAPE users FAST, and EFFICIENT help with anything of their RSPS related needs, so there isn&#39;t a bunch of the same threads because people can&#39;t figure out how to fix, or they don&#39;t get what they need from past threads. Or maybe their error or issue is a LITTLE different than anyone they could find, but they don&#39;t understand it, we&#39;re also here to help teach REAL Java, so there can be MORE real programmers in the MOPAR community. We&#39;re not stealing users or anything, again we&#39;re HELPING. This shouldn&#39;t be a issue.</description>

</aside>
<p>“More better”.<br>
The Team-J Program didn’t do very much. I personally would know as you can see my name is still on it. Honestly, there was no influx of people asking for help. I had about the exact same volume of people coming to me for help as per usual.</p>
<p>All it does, and I mean this, is it puts a bunch of names together for people to look at.</p>
<p>If a person is not willing to help themselves, then they’re not going to get anything out of someone else helping them. Therefore, the way this site works is just fine for how help is provided. People have to <span class="bbcode-i">want</span> it enough to register an account, and then post a topic about that issue. Plus, that doesn’t mention the 670k topics on the website or the 4 million replies (Numbers based on post IDs. not actual statistics)…</p>
<p>And if you want to talk about “no one trying to help people out”. Go look in the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,48.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Server Help</a> section. I sure as hell don’t see you in any of the posts.<br>

<p>Yup, I can get their notification, DATA free via skype when I’m out and about, and can contact one of my partners.<br>
Now that’s not too bad of a idea. Go look harder. BTW, I could point numerous out, because I’m not doesn’t mean that I can’t.<br>
And you’re welcome for your interface one of my artist created for you.[/quote]<br>
First, any notification sent by skype would use 3g/4g data or wifi if available. Skype is an instant messaging application. There’s no way you can use it without using up your precious data or a wifi connection. And the fact that you keep <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> pointing them out even though I’ve asked 3 times to is proving you can’t…</p>
<p>Lastly, Jack is not “your artist”:</p>

<p>Yet other people can create their own methods of helping out the community and putting them onto this site, and users from this site are using them. That are outside of mopar. Look in the Server Help section people have the same problems, over and over, simple ones, if they can’t figure it out by people POSTING on THREADS telling them what to do and how to do it, is NOT helping them. People would much rather prefer actual help, and interaction, unfortunately MOPARSCAPE doesn’t alert my phone when I’m not sitting on my computer all day and I’m out having a life, or doing something, etc, being out and about get it? I get the alert, and they can get FAST help, and there’s other people I can put them in contact with depending on their needs. This is more than just a help section, we’re here to provide MOPARSCAPE users FAST, and EFFICIENT help with anything of their RSPS related needs, so there isn’t a bunch of the same threads because people can’t figure out how to fix, or they don’t get what they need from past threads. Or maybe their error or issue is a LITTLE different than anyone they could find, but they don’t understand it, we’re also here to help teach REAL Java, so there can be MORE real programmers in the MOPAR community. We’re not stealing users or anything, again we’re HELPING. This shouldn’t be a issue.</p>
