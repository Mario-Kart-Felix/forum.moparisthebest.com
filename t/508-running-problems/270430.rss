    <description>Hey guys, ive just changed to a 508 server, but im having problems making it even run.  When I click run server I get the error of &quot;The system cannot find the path specified&quot;.
When i click run on the client , it gets up to &quot;Connecting to update server&quot; and i get the error of &quot;error_game_js5connect&quot;.
This might be really ovious to some people but it isnt for me. 
Thanks for the help guys =)</description>
