              <p>I find this really interesting.</p>
<p>I know RuneRebels has done this in an interesting way, but I do think it would be brilliant having ten or so fake players around the home area to give a new server more of a community feel. You could definitely achieve a lot of great things with this at your disposal in terms of starting up a new server.</p>
