    <title>Drygores</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/drygores/553384</link>
    <description>So, It has been forever since I have been on a RSPS or even Runescape for that matter. (Over about 2-3 years/ 4 years on EOC RS) 
Anyway, I was wondering if anyone knows any good RSPS Server and Clients that are most up-to date with EOC.
Etc, Drygores, New armor, Bosses, etc. 
I would like to use one of these to mess around with to get use to coding again. (Will not host nor modify to host their rsps unless given permission).

Thanks,
 Rexxy</description>

<p>Well, are there any client and sources with drygores? I can’t run webclients for some reason, they just don’t start up. So I wanna download one to play on.</p>

</aside>
<p>Webclients don’t work due to a recent Java update (Actually not <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> recent).<br>
Java now requires any web applet to be signed using a certificate for it to work on for everyone. If it’s self signed, which 99% of clients are, then you must add an exception for the website to your Java whitelist.</p>
<p>You can read more about this on the java website: <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_blocked.xml" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Why are Java applications blocked by your security settings with the latest Java?</a><br>
<a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/exception_sitelist.xml" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">How can I configure the Exception Site List?</a></p>
<p>However, you seem to be confused here…</p>
<p>Are you looking for a <span class="bbcode-u">server to <span class="bbcode-b">play</span></span> or a <span class="bbcode-u">server to <span class="bbcode-b">develop</span></span>?</p>
<p>As they are two different things entirely.</p>

You’re not going to find a working server with EOC.<br>
The closest to that has 10000 bugs in it and the packets aren’t even finished.</p>
<p>You’ll have to find a 718/7XX server, that’s about the best you can do.</p>
