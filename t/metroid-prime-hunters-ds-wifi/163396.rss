    <description>Hey! I play metroid for the ds on wifi all the time? It&#39;s a really cool game. Weapons, Charecter-selections, Singlecard and multicard. All around, its a good game. If anyone wants do add me, post your friend code and we can get on and play w/ each other. my name is DELETD RNK. heres my friend code

how to find friend code : select multiplayer mode at main menu. select nintendo wifi connection. select edit friends and rivals. select add friend . there it shows your friend code. thats also the place where you type in a friends friend code. but we both have to add eachother to play :)</description>
