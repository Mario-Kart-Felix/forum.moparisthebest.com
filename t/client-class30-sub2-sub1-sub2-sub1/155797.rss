    <description>Class30_sub2_sub1_sub1 loads custom sprites.
Class30_sub2_sub1_sub2 loads cache based sprites.
So why can&#39;t I reroute the client (which defines where to load which sprites from) to load cache sprites from custom files?
What I&#39;m going on about is that I have asked  5 or 6 very reputable Java coders (who claim to know how to add a custom mapback), and yet I get different answers from each of them. Of course, none of them will tell me anything other than what file to be looking in, or a generalization of what I need to be doing. And then when I further question, I get shit for being a &#39;nub&#39;.

Now would someone mind explaining why changing the mapback to load from Class30_sub2_sub1_sub1, makes the game crash on the loading of Game Engine? I was given a code by &#39;Haxerownsmopar&#39;, which doesn&#39;t help me. He gave me one line of code, and nobody has yet to explain to me what this code does, what context to use it in, and instead, call me a nub for asking questions. I am looking for help with a fairly complex problem, and I do NOT want someone to make me a nice C+P tutorial. I want somebody to explain why the method they tell me works. Why I can&#39;t just change the mapback loader to sub1, and why I am getting the Game Engine error, when the loader is in Config.

Please, and thank you.</description>
