    <description>Im unsure whats wrong with my server, It worked for like a week or so. Now it won&#39;t connect even the slightest.
My Run Command Prompt doesn&#39;t say anything about anyone even trying to connect it just stays blank. It worked one day, My power went out for a while. And now no one can log on.</description>

Check that.[/quote]<br>
