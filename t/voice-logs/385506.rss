    <description>It&#39;s kind of like a video log, but it&#39;s just me talking about random things. I&#39;m doing it to practice in public speaking. Its really helping me, I&#39;m actually seeing results in my speech where I actually don&#39;t stutter a lot which has been a problem because I was raised with my Asian side of the family most of the time.

Give me some comments on what I can possibly improve on as far as speech, subjects to talk about, remembering what I&#39;m talking about. Everything that can help me improve. Would love some feedback. I won&#39;t post the first two because you can find those easily. I&#39;m not too concerned on if you understand what I&#39;m talking about because it&#39;s mainly aimed at my friends for laughs.</description>
