&#39;Thank you for reading through our post. Indubitably, the veracity that we endeavor to bring forth exceeds expectations far above those of other Rsps communities. Just ask yourself. Do I want to be a part of the change? Do I want an experience like no other? Do I want to be a part of a potentially great community? Do I want to say &quot;I was there&quot; when you are still with our community years from now? Well, we do, and we hope that you indulge yourselves within our hard work as well.&#39;



Quote and Passage From Staff Member:

&quot;The head coder for Armageddon is very clever and has only included the finest aspects of Runescape. I was astonished to see such a well coded server as I&#39;ve seen the other attempts before that we&#39;ve tried, collaborating with others like Cody and Lauren. I myself have played many popular Private Servers and am proud to say that Armageddon has a lot more potential then the others and is much more packed with essential features. Where else would you find ONE single Private Server that would have 15+ bosses like Nomad, PQ, Dag Kings and still balance the fighting with skills like Dungeoneering, Construction, Summoning or occupy players with LRC or Quests. Questing is one fundamental aspect of Runescape. Yet the minority of Private Servers have that, its a shame. And to end it together, this Private Server is based on Runescape when it was in its full glory, its not an old 317 or an over complicated new 711+ revision, its the best you can get off Runescape!&quot;
