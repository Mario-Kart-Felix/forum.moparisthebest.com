    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cannot-find-the-main-class/87087</link>
    <description>Hi, Ive been trying to download Moparscape to my friends computer, and it says that &quot; it can not find the main class.&quot; I have tried to download a new version of Java, and even Java Env. 6.0 JDK like advised to me before, however it says there was an error in configuration.

Any ideas?
