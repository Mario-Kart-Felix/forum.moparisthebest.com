    <title>What was JutScape&#39;s source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-was-jutscapes-source/197086</link>
    <description>Ok a long time ago I played a server called JutScape, and I want the source he used..

The source had this stuff:

The only way to get rares was from an admin
Base was in varrock dummy place.
There was a farming patch, with a shop right next to it to buy seeds to farm with.
Rune claws were in def spot, and obby maul looked like rs
On the east side of the bank there was a runecraft altar, which was the only way to get runes for barraging
The only way to get d chain was by killing kq, and you had to make her.
There were portals near the bank, I remember one was to a pk spot that was black and had lava.
if you typed ::fish it would take you to the fountain in east varrock
pk2 took you to this rectangle area where you could pk
there was a shop in the base where they sold obby cape, initiate, etc.

If anyone knows what source this is can you please tell me?</description>
