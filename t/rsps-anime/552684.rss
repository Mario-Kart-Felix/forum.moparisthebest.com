    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-anime/552684</link>
    <description>Would it be possibly to emulate a selected anime onto Runescape&#39;s system? I&#39;ve thought for many months about making a Naruto game with customs maps, items, etc.. But how would jutsu and other spells work? It&#39;s just been a thought that&#39;s been passing through my mind for several months now. Also if you don&#39;t think it&#39;ll work out. Which type of system would you recommend.</description>

              <p>Good luck making ninjas in a game with 0.6 s ticks. RS isn’t a good engine to use for anything but RS. Unless you just want a reskin of RS into something Anime-ish.</p>
