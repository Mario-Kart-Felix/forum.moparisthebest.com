    <title>Option to use all bones on altar at once</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/option-to-use-all-bones-on-altar-at-once/446759</link>
    <description>Was wondering if anyone could lead me in the right direction to code in the ability to use all bones on altar instead of having to do them one buy one. This would be greatly appreciated. Many people on my server have suggested this and I want to come through for them as it is a great suggestion. I have seen it done on other servers. I&#39;ve tried looking on mutiple sites, either I can not find it or people are just flat our dick and do not want to help.</description>
