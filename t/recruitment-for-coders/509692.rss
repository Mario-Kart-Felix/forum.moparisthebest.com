    <title>Recruitment for Coders</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/recruitment-for-coders/509692</link>
    <description>As you can tell by the title we are looking for an experienced coder for mine and my friends RSPS. We currently have a 4GB VPS with a website domain ordered. At the moment, www.projectfatality.enjin.com is our forum host but we have Screenshot by Lightshot this that I made. 

We have had no problems except from we are new to coding Runescape sided Java. We currently have issues with the changing of shop prices, adding and removing items from the shop and some skills and animations for skills and weapons. The server revision is a 718. 

You can find my Skype by either messaging me on here or you can email myself or Josh at;

OR email our support at 

Please note, if you have any queries or questions don&#39;t hesitate to email or message me!

Thank you in advance, 
Zinotia &amp; Josh
