    <description>Alright 
[IMG]http://i46.tinypic.com/2em2y6p.jpg[/img]
This was like this when I got the client because I know for a fact that I didn&#39;t fuck anything up. 

So I believe the problem to be in entitydef.class but, how do I fix it? I would have a go at it but I never messed with class files before, so if anyone else has a grasp on this situation please help.

If anyone can teamview to help that would be amazing just add my skype tikedesigns , please I can&#39;t compile my client without it fixed</description>
