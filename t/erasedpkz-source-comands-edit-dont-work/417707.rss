those codes that i edit did not work as you can see i changed owner name to Juggalo king and some custom saying to the messages that are sent with the commands but they dont work or show up even the changed link for the vote link and that was very simple to change


   [code] if (c.playerRights &gt;= 0)
        playerCommands(c, playerCommand);
    if (c.playerRights == 1 || c.playerRights == 2 || c.playerRights == 3) 
        moderatorCommands(c, playerCommand);
    if (c.playerRights == 2 || c.playerRights == 3) 
        administratorCommands(c, playerCommand);
    if (c.playerRights == 3) 
        ownerCommands(c, playerCommand);
        if (c.playerRights == 4) 
        DonatorCommands(c, playerCommand);[/code]
