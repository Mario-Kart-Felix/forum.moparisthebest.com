Introduction[/b][/u][/left]

I have wanted to contribute something to you, moparisthebest community (everyone), it is a software that will keep your computer safe. Now I can as I have some spare time today! The software I wanted to provide you with is called ZoneAlarm. ZoneAlarm is acclaimed to be the best firewall software available. The versions that I am providing you with usually cost $39.95-$49.99, but now it is free!

We all hate getting viruses, spyware, adware, malicious (harmful) files, and more onto our computers! You don&#39;t have to worry about protecting your computer anymore. This software will automatically do it for you. Are you afraid of going to sites that automatically download trojans, or viruses onto your computer? ZoneAlarm will immediately block that site, and prevent anything from being downloaded. Don&#39;t hesitate to download a file, Zonealarm will check that file upon download, and if it&#39;s found harmful, the file will be deleted before it can install itself.

I have used ZoneAlarm, and recommend that everyone should use it. It has protected my computer numerous times. This firewall comes with a lifetime of updates! It will notify you if there is a newer version of the software available. You won&#39;t ever need to find another firewall. It also contains a virus scanner, and a spyware scanner. I suggest that you keep your own virus scanner, and spyware scanner because the built-in ZoneAlarm virus and spyware scanner takes a lot of ram when it is being used. ZoneAlarm, however, doesn&#39;t take that much space compared to firewalls made by other companies. It is less than 35mb.

It is really easy to install this software. All you do is have to download it from the links below, extract it, and then click on the setup file, Zone Alarm Pro or Suite, depending on which one you downloaded. (In order to extract it, you need winrar, or any other archiver that can extract .rar files.) After you run the setup it will configure everything, and might have some options fro you to choose from.

[u][b]Definitions[/b][/u]

[b]Firewall[/b]: Any of a number of security schemes that prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to a computer network or that monitor transfers of information to and from the network.

[b]Virus[/b]: A computer program that is designed to replicate itself by copying itself into the other programs stored in a computer. It may be benign or have a negative effect, such as causing a program to operate incorrectly or corrupting a computer&#39;s memory.

[b]Spyware[/b]: Software that sends information about your Web surfing habits to its Web site. Often quickly installed in your computer in combination with a free download you selected from the Web, spyware transmits information in the background as you move around the Web. Also known as &quot;parasite software,&quot; &quot;scumware,&quot; &quot;junkware&quot; and &quot;thiefware,&quot; spyware is occasionally installed just by visiting a Web site

[b]Adware[/b]: Software that periodically pops up advertisements on a user&#39;s computer. It displays ads targeted to the individual user based on key words entered in search engines and the types of Web sites the user visits. The marketing data is collected periodically and sent in the background to the adware Web server. Adware is known as &quot;contextual marketing.&quot;

Enjoy!

<p>PS: ZoneAlarm reaks lol, Kaspersky is the best firewall now. ZoneAlarm, Norton, McAfee, and BlackIce are such resource hogs.

Introduction</span></span>[/left]</p>
<p>I have wanted to contribute something to you, moparisthebest community (everyone), it is a software that will keep your computer safe. Now I can as I have some spare time today! The software I wanted to provide you with is called ZoneAlarm. ZoneAlarm is acclaimed to be the best firewall software available. The versions that I am providing you with usually cost $39.95-$49.99, but now it is free!</p>
<p>We all hate getting viruses, spyware, adware, malicious (harmful) files, and more onto our computers! You don’t have to worry about protecting your computer anymore. This software will automatically do it for you. Are you afraid of going to sites that automatically download trojans, or viruses onto your computer? ZoneAlarm will immediately block that site, and prevent anything from being downloaded. Don’t hesitate to download a file, Zonealarm will check that file upon download, and if it’s found harmful, the file will be deleted before it can install itself.</p>
<p>I have used ZoneAlarm, and recommend that everyone should use it. It has protected my computer numerous times. This firewall comes with a lifetime of updates! It will notify you if there is a newer version of the software available. You won’t ever need to find another firewall. It also contains a virus scanner, and a spyware scanner. I suggest that you keep your own virus scanner, and spyware scanner because the built-in ZoneAlarm virus and spyware scanner takes a lot of ram when it is being used. ZoneAlarm, however, doesn’t take that much space compared to firewalls made by other companies. It is less than 35mb.</p>
<p>It is really easy to install this software. All you do is have to download it from the links below, extract it, and then click on the setup file, Zone Alarm Pro or Suite, depending on which one you downloaded. (In order to extract it, you need winrar, or any other archiver that can extract .rar files.) After you run the setup it will configure everything, and might have some options fro you to choose from.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Firewall</span>: Any of a number of security schemes that prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to a computer network or that monitor transfers of information to and from the network.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Virus</span>: A computer program that is designed to replicate itself by copying itself into the other programs stored in a computer. It may be benign or have a negative effect, such as causing a program to operate incorrectly or corrupting a computer’s memory.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Spyware</span>: Software that sends information about your Web surfing habits to its Web site. Often quickly installed in your computer in combination with a free download you selected from the Web, spyware transmits information in the background as you move around the Web. Also known as “parasite software,” “scumware,” “junkware” and “thiefware,” spyware is occasionally installed just by visiting a Web site</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Adware</span>: Software that periodically pops up advertisements on a user’s computer. It displays ads targeted to the individual user based on key words entered in search engines and the types of Web sites the user visits. The marketing data is collected periodically and sent in the background to the adware Web server. Adware is known as “contextual marketing.”</p>
