    <title>[PI]Custom login screen issue, please help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-custom-login-screen-issue-please-help/477937</link>
    <description>Well, a while back i decided to add a different/better log in box than the one i had. I had the erasedpkz login box. After i did the tutorial, there was a problem with a little black box under the login, so all i did was pretty much put part of the background in to the login.png. This is what it looks like when i don&#39;t have that part in: [img]http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz246/deamonchubby/2012-11-17_1715.png[/img]... I&#39;m now ready for a new and improved HD login box that also handles transparency, but i can&#39;t get rid of this damn black box under it.....</description>
