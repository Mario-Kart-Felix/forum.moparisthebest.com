    <description>Alright so, i have a source right now, and i just have absolutely no idea how to code and edit shit at all.
I would greatly appreciate a coder and i would like one with prior knowledge. Not a new coder who is just getting used to everything. I would very much like a coder who knows what he/she is doing and can help me out good. I can host the server on my computer. i just need a coder. please comment back</description>

              <p>Starting off programming an RSPS is a horrible idea. I suggest you go and look in the ‘general programming section’ or go and look at the java oracle tutorial. You’ll learn real Java not just that RSPS stuff. <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/</a></p>
<p>Anyways, this isn’t allowed we have a tutorial section for a reason, with plenty of guides, so use it.</p>

              <p>Well, id honestly like to learn how to code, i need to start somewhere with something. I cant understand everything on my own. You had to have started somewhere and im just trying to as well. starting off on an easy going server would help me to be able to make my own later on and keep it stable enough on my own and be confident in what im doing</p>

              <p>This is what I hate. . . People want to make a server and they don’t know anything about coding. Java Scripting. Makes me wanna push myself down the stairs.</p>
