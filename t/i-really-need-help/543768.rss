    <description>Dear fellow forum visitors and members,

I was wondering if anyone has a roatzpk cheat client, i see all these java source codes to help people code their own, and i have no knowledge at all. So,i was wondering if anyone has a cheat client for roatzpk which is fully ready. Much appreciated.</description>
