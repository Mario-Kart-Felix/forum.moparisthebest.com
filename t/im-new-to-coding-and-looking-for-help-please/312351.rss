the xxxx is x coords and yyyy is y coords. the 2213 is the ID for bankbooth. the 0 can be changed to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4…or someshit and thats what way it faces…the 10…i dont know what the hell that is but you need it there.<br>
some servers have make instead of add for the GlobalObject…mine has make not add. and i hope this helped bro[/quote]<br>
First is the X coordinate, 2nd is the Y coordinate, the 3rd is the object ID, the 4th is the orientation (the way it faces) and the 5th is the tile object type.</p>
