    <title>Creating my own base from scratch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-my-own-base-from-scratch/337785</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m new here!

I&#39;m sorry my first post is a question, but I was wondering which tools and methods would be recommended to build a base from scratch. I&#39;ve checked the stickies and I&#39;ve noticed most of them recommend that I download an existing base client and server. I however want to try and create my own from just a blank project file in my IDE as a starting point.

I do not play RuneScape very much - only a level 27 free account. I do however think the idea of developing a server for it would be neat! I&#39;m majoring in this kind of stuff in college and I figured that this would be a fun way to broaden my understanding of Java.

I am familiar with developing small types of software in Java like apps and some games, but I am not familiar with RuneScape&#39;s cache or the way I would go about re-creating it from scratch.

So if you have any suggestions I would appreciate it, thanks!  :)</description>

<p>Okay. I’ll register over there (did you mean R-S the other forum)?</p>
<p>Also, I’m going to try Hyperion to start off with, I like the idea of it being very clean. If it’s too much I’ll switch to delta - but I think it should be fine.</p>

              <p>Gnomad, you should probably use a RS2HD source then if you know something about it already, they are clean and packaged. Some people also have tutorials on them, and such. And dont worry about using someone elses work, what do you think RSPS is about? We use Jagex client every time we play a server, or it wouldnt be a rsps anymore.</p>
<p>So either way its gonna be done, but in this way you get a better start with a server. Use RS2HD in my opinion, like i said clean and packaged already so it should be easy for you to understand <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I think I will download a base and client after all and work from there - I don’t like the idea of using other people’s work (in regards to things like this - everything is the work of someone else at one point or another :P), but I guess it’s a starting point.</p>
<p>To clarify - I’m only new to how RuneScape works and the idea of making a RuneScape private server, I’m already pretty familiar with Java itself. (I noticed a few of you were suggesting that I learn Java and things like that)</p>
<p>I’ll go download one of the bases in that sticky. What about a client? Which would you suggest for cleanliness and very basic functionality - I don’t want any features, just a base. Sorry to be so demanding, I appreciate your help !</p>

Like the soul said, but every server (I don’t care what base it is) is unstable because Jagex programmed runescape in runescript.</p>
<p>Also learn conventions first <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

<p>That’s so deviant of you guys! It explains a lot though thank you!</p>
<p>Also, I’m already pretty stingy about the look and flow of what I write - so neatness is no issue! :P[/quote]<br>
If you like it “neat” Don’t go with an allstar source or a silabgarza, just because they are very sloppy in my opinion.  And they have a lot of extra things that arn’t needed in them.</p>

              <p>You can’t Recreate a server, but you can edit and make it better.<br>
So how was Runescape private server first come along? Well people have found out how to take Jagex’s client and read the java methods from their client, to make a server.<br>
There are also rumours that some former Jagex member could have released a fraction of the game to someone, and it spread around like a virus.</p>

              <p>Gnomad you wont make it trying to start from scratch, many professionals[or so they call their-selves] have tried and only a hand full out of two hands make it, since your new its recommended you do as it said.</p>
<p>Recommended: Download an existing server and client, if you want a challenge then you can get one they call a “blank” which aren’t really blank, but nice to use when you wanna do something like that which has less in them but aren’t totally blank and has the basics.</p>
<p>Not Recommended: Still want a blank? Go to your desktop, create a folder, name it server files, open the folder, create a notepad,name it client.java and there you go! (seriously you don’t wanna attempt a blank this early on, because it sounds hard starting out like i said huh? if so then its NOT for you) – [don’t take this literally -.-]</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>[EDIT]: btw Rune Scape Private Servers, aren’t something you wanna brag about doing in college, and i would recommend you using a program like: Unity3D - its amazing 3d features are great, and if your as good as you think you are then this will be your chance to make your own game which you can show off. Its good for some practices in; Javascript, C++, and something else i forgot lol.</p>

<p>Download a base and client, and look at those to help guide you in making your own from scratch.<br>

<p>Thanks for the tip, I may just end up doing that. Learning from what’s already there, trying to recreate it…etc…</p>
<p>A part of me is still curious where THEY began however. Where did they get the files to begin with? Did they fetch things from RuneScape or did they literally model and recreate everything by hand?</p>

(don’t hold me to this I might be wrong)--------<br>
I believe that we only copyrighted the client from jagex, but the server files are ALL ours, and were typed.</p>

              <p>Hi, I’m new here!</p>
<p>I’m sorry my first post is a question, but I was wondering which tools and methods would be recommended to build a base from scratch. I’ve checked the stickies and I’ve noticed most of them recommend that I download an existing base client and server. I however want to try and create my own from just a blank project file in my IDE as a starting point.</p>
<p>I do not play RuneScape very much - only a level 27 free account. I do however think the idea of developing a server for it would be neat! I’m majoring in this kind of stuff in college and I figured that this would be a fun way to broaden my understanding of Java.</p>
<p>I am familiar with developing small types of software in Java like apps and some games, but I am not familiar with RuneScape’s cache or the way I would go about re-creating it from scratch.</p>
<p>So if you have any suggestions I would appreciate it, thanks!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
