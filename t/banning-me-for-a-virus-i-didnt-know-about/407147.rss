    <title>Banning me for a virus i didnt know about?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/banning-me-for-a-virus-i-didnt-know-about/407147</link>
    <description>Recently i posted a topic with a direct download to something i thought was legit cause i scanned it with microsoft security essentials and norton 360... Stupid me, but without being notified i am now on a ban-list. WHY? I do not want to be banned nor do i want to harm any users, i have talked it out with the person who reported me and even he doesn&#39;t believe me. I haven&#39;t ever coded a single thing in my life... let alone a virus. Hell i had no idea what this rat was until i googled it and i still don&#39;t know what it is  :|. I have been accused of acting stupid just so i don&#39;t get banned, how do i convince the moderators to keep me from being banned i really meant no harm! The only reason i ever registered in the first place was to play minecraft!</description>

              <p>You obviously aren’t banned, so stop whining and move on <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Just don’t do anything like that again (I believe you did it accidentally)</p>
