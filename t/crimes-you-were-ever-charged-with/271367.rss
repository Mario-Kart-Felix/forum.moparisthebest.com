    <title>Crimes you were ever charged with</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crimes-you-were-ever-charged-with/271367</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been gone for awhile due to being in prison for 11 days and house arrest, I have 12 months of probation left for 2 Counts of theft, possession of narcotics having a firearm underage without a permit and resisting arrest.

So what crimes have you guys done and got in trouble for?

It doesn&#39;t have to be like arrested, you could have been kicked out of school.. but nothing lower than that.

Anyway, I want to see some interesting stories here so lets get it going. :D</description>

              <p>I don’t think this is a charging, but sometime last year I got in a fight at a party with some kid in Year 11. I broke his nose and fractured his cheek-bone with a head kick. It went to the police, I was interviewed and stuff. But I didn’t get charged I don’t think. As far as I know it was put on my record, but I wasn’t actually fined because I did it out of self-defense (witnesses stated he started on me).</p>
