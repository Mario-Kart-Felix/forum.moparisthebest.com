    <description>Im trying to stop players loging in from other clients other than my official client but i need help info below.


Ive got this in &quot;RS2LoginProtocolDecoder.java&quot;

[code]						long clientSessionKey = in.getLong();
						long serverSessionKey = in.getLong();
						int uid = in.getInt();
						
						if(uid == 0 || uid == 123456) {
							session.close();
							return false;
                                                }
						[/code]
And the # 123456 is the uid number that i have in my client, but atm it still allows any1 with any uid number in their client to log in.

And when i put this in
[code]                                                int uid = in.getInt();
                                                if(uid != 123456) {
                                                        session.close();
                                                        return false;
                                                }[/code]
it stops people from logging in and says error connecting to loging server but its the same uid as whats in the client?
im not sure why it does this.

What do i have to change to this? to only allow people playing from the client with this &quot;uid&quot; #123456 to connect..?</description>
