    <description>[b]Purpose: To help people understand how to change the default images for rsps clients. (loginbox, admin, mod icon, logo, etc.)[/b]

[b]Difficulty:[/b] 2/10, depends on your knowledge of reading carefully.
[b]Estimated Time:[/b] A good 15-20 minutes to do so, once you get the hang of it, it wont take but 5 minutes.
[b]Things that might be useful during this this tutorial:[/b] A clean and organized computer, and take your time to read the whole tutorial.

[b]Note:[/b] This will only edit cache up to [377] clients, as I have tested, if I am wrong, tell me.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________


Alright, first of all, you will need &quot;Tom&#39;s Cache Suite&quot;, download it by clicking 
[url=http://nuke-net.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/suite.zip][u][b]here[/b][/u][/url]
Now that you have downloaded, extract it to the desktop, you should see these files:
[img]http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/470/50721630.png[/img]
Then, you&#39;re going to open up the &quot;suite&quot;.jar file, and this should come up.
[img]http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/663/52632259.png[/img]
Now, you&#39;re going to go to &quot;File&gt;Load Cache...&gt;(your clients cache folder. where the main_file_cache is), and then hit &quot;Open&quot;.

You don&#39;t see your clients cache? That&#39;s because it hides the cache, but it knows it&#39;s there, so you&#39;re not doing anything wrong if you don&#39;t see it. I am using 

DdsSpeced V2 Client [377], so I got my cache loaded, and the screen now looks like this:
[img]http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/3928/31549754.png[/img]
Click on &quot;View/Edit [u]I[/u]mage [u]A[/u]rchives&quot;, and in this tut. , I will be editing the old rs logo to the newer one. Make sure when you hit &quot;View/Edit 

[u]I[/u]mage [u]A[/u]rchives&quot;, that it&#39;s selected on &quot;Title&quot;, and select &quot;Ok&quot;. Now, this or something similar to this should pop up.
[img]http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/9752/54482003.png[/img]

Now, download the new rslogo, by clicking [url=http://download206.mediafire.com/fdknxyqis2ig/jtmkjkbmttn/rslogo.png][u][b]here[/b][/u][/url] Save it to 

your desktop.

Once you&#39;ve done that, go back to &quot;Tom&#39;s Cache Editor&quot;, still with the same window open, click on &quot;logo.dat&quot;, and on the bottom, there should be something like:
[img]http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/1282/34841802.png[/img]
Click the &quot;Import&quot; button, select the new rs logo picture you downloaded just recently, and then hit &quot;save&quot;. Now, hit the button that says &quot;Save Archive&quot;, and if it says 

&quot;To prevent cache corrupt, would you like to repack cache?&quot; or something like that, hit yes, then save archive., when it gives you the &quot;Archived repacked sucessfully&quot; 

word, Just start up your client, and look at the new logo :) 


Hope this tut. was helpful..

<span class="bbcode-b">Things that might be useful during this this tutorial:</span> A clean and organized computer, and take your time to read the whole tutorial.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> This will only edit cache up to [377] clients, as I have tested, if I am wrong, tell me.</p>
<hr>
<p>Alright, first of all, you will need “Tom’s Cache Suite”, download it by clicking<br>
<a href="http://nuke-net.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/suite.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">here</span></span></a><br>
Now that you have downloaded, extract it to the desktop, you should see these files:<br>
<img src="http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/470/50721630.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Then, you’re going to open up the “suite”.jar file, and this should come up.<br>
<img src="http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/663/52632259.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Now, you’re going to go to "File&gt;Load Cache…&gt;(your clients cache folder. where the main_file_cache is), and then hit “Open”.</p>
<p>You don’t see your clients cache? That’s because it hides the cache, but it knows it’s there, so you’re not doing anything wrong if you don’t see it. I am using</p>
<p>DdsSpeced V2 Client [377], so I got my cache loaded, and the screen now looks like this:<br>
<img src="http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/3928/31549754.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Click on “View/Edit <span class="bbcode-u">I</span>mage <span class="bbcode-u">A</span>rchives”, and in this tut. , I will be editing the old rs logo to the newer one. Make sure when you hit "View/Edit</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">I</span>mage <span class="bbcode-u">A</span>rchives", that it’s selected on “Title”, and select “Ok”. Now, this or something similar to this should pop up.<br>
<img src="http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/9752/54482003.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Now, download the new rslogo, by clicking <a href="http://download206.mediafire.com/fdknxyqis2ig/jtmkjkbmttn/rslogo.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">here</span></span></a> Save it to</p>
<p>your desktop.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done that, go back to “Tom’s Cache Editor”, still with the same window open, click on “logo.dat”, and on the bottom, there should be something like:<br>
<img src="http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/1282/34841802.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Click the “Import” button, select the new rs logo picture you downloaded just recently, and then hit “save”. Now, hit the button that says “Save Archive”, and if it says</p>
<p>“To prevent cache corrupt, would you like to repack cache?” or something like that, hit yes, then save archive., when it gives you the “Archived repacked sucessfully”</p>
<p>word, Just start up your client, and look at the new logo <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Hope this tut. was helpful…</p>

95% Tom’s Cache Suite for the program</p>
