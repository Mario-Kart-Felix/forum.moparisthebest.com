    <title>Connection problem &quot; must be down &quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-problem-must-be-down/23807</link>
    <description>Every time i want to connect to a server and i tried all of the online servers it says &quot; Error connecting to server. Must be down. click &quot;cancel&quot; then &quot;start server&quot; to make your own.&quot; Ive tried all the stuff : clicking staring server, going to another server and it always says that. So after 3 hours of trying im getting really pissed off of that cause yesterday i was able to play on it. :mad: and also like 1 times on 5 i connect to the server but as soon as im in it my connection is lost  :confused:

Plz respond as fast as possible
