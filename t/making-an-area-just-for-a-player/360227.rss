    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-an-area-just-for-a-player/360227</link>
    <description>Okay...I want to make an area that all players on my server can teleport to, but when they are in, the players cannot see each other. Like a POH. Also, i would like the player to be able to make walls and other objects in that area..so yes it is basically a POH. any ideas???</description>

Save it as a token. This way it will load the heightLevel from the character file, instead of giving them a new one.<br>

<p>A token is usually part of a string array, not a normal identifier.</p>

<p>Instead of something such as heightLevel += 4; the general method designed was playerId*4; Though both will work, you must remember to tokenize the integers, or they will not be the same every time.[/quote]<br>

<p>Technically, you could write an entire server using different heights, such as height 4 is a pvp world, height 8 is a skilling world, and height 0 (normal) is the normal world.</p>
