    <description>Ok i recently added alot of commands, just some fun emote commands and an ::alch command for players on my server. All of a sudden random commands are working. My command for yell is ::yell, but some people can only do it using ::messa or some only ::. I have no clue why this is happening. And commands that worked perfectly now dc my users. The simple alch command dcs them. Help please.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 02, 2009, 08:52:04 am[/size][hr][code]Exception encountered while parsing incoming packets from Oelecthor.

You would then no that the server is screwing itself over because you messed something up with the packet handling.[/quote]to bad i have not touched the packet handling, Only thing i had done is add more commands. Which is why i dont know whats wrong. I was no where near anything to do with how my packets are handled. So i would appreciate you tell me how to fix this rather than tell me i messed something up. Another update, it keeps switching the commands that it affects and uses commands not even coded into the server to do things.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 02, 2009, 12:26:48 pm[/size][hr]bump please <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
