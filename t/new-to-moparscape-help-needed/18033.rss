    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-to-moparscape-help-needed/18033</link>
    <description>I just got Moparscape and my Java is up to date....so idk the problem. It says

[code]Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefErrorFound: Bot[/code]

I&#39;d really appericate anyone who replys because I want to try out armor, etc. 

EDIT: I went to moparisthebest.com earlier and it worked...but then I forgot my username and pass....but I made it earlier when I forgot my username and pass...I just made a new one. Now it says to click start server, then user...But, what I said above about the java.lang was for the Moparscape I d/led.</description>
