    <title>Help getting Cheezscape running!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-getting-cheezscape-running/200337</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m on my mac atm and I know it can work with java and all that. I just did stuffit expander (unrarx) with- CHEEZSCAPE_UPDATE80[1].SOURCE.rar and it made a folder called CHEEZSCAPE_UPDATE80[1].SOURCE.... everything seems to look similar to the generic hybridscape that you get when you download mopar. but now im trying to figure out how to get it running. am i supposed to use the mopar client with it or does it contain it&#39;s own client. i tried running a bunch of .class and .bat files but terminal/java doesn&#39;t like them. do i just add something to my mopar file or what lol.</description>
