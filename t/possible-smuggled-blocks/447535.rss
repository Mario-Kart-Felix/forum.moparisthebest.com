    <title>Possible Smuggled Blocks</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/possible-smuggled-blocks/447535</link>
    <description>A few weeks ago I went to solve a report on some grief near the World 2 spawn. While I was there I found this:

The mossy block running around the side can only be found in strongholds. When I asked Herobrine about it he said that upon expansion in World 2 he found two small rooms of the blocks and nothing else. For anyone who hasn&#39;t been to one of the strongholds they are huge mazes of corridors and rooms with the walls lined of these and a few other blocks.

To me it seems highly unlikely that a stronghold that spawned has just been cut down to two small rooms. So when I asked him to show me the place he found them, he had conveniently forgotten where. I didn&#39;t take them from him since I had no definitive proof that he had taken them from creative, but i said to hide them in a chest so no one else can take them.

Mitb if you (or Tom/Zuppers) could check his chests to see if he has smuggled anything else from creative then hopefully this can be resolved without the economy being wrecked by probable smugled items.</description>
