    <title>So I want to start a Delta</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-i-want-to-start-a-delta/478480</link>
    <description>Sup guys, just a little story about me and a few questions ;)


I have been coding RsPs since 2009 and I have always coded on a Delta base server.
About a year ago I quited the RsPs scene playing/coding scene and moved on to coding in another langauge then Java.


However while browsering Youtube and finding old video&#39;s that my players made while my Delta was online in the past I kinda missed the feeling to own a server that you are proud of because I spend so much time developing content for the players.


Everyone that hosted a server knows what I am talking about :-)


I decided to message some old buddy&#39;s and since 2 weeks ago I started to work on my Delta again. Because I recently went to a school that focus on programming software and websites I looked to coding another way and I have achieved things that I couldnt have done before. Probably for the most of you simple things like creating a webclient.


There is just one big problem with Delta that always has been there but I just do not know what to do against it.
You might gues it already; [b]Networking[/b]


I think that I am pretty good in developing content on my server but the problem is that I do not know anything about the networking in Delta. I am sure that my server cannot hold more then 60 players online at once (I reached that before). It just starts lagging, nulling and crashing. I just dont know what to do with it and it was and is always a big problem.


I would really like to learn more about how the networking is done and ways to improve it but I just dont know where to start. I have considered to pay for developers that could do this for me but I want to do it my self so I can be proud when I release it back to the community. 


Could anyone give me a hint to the right direction? Should I just follow Java tutorials and thats it? Or what?


inb4 We do not care


Thank you,


- Youri</description>

<p>You would be better off using a PI over Delta. Networking is better, but the only problem is the shit crammed into process(). I suggest cleaning out your server and using the most efficient and stable code possible. That would help, but would not solve your problems. Delta servers are hard to get right.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The only thing that got me back into RsPs is to code a Delta on my own server. I do not want to start learning another server type from start again. It just doesnt feel as ‘my server’ because there are 1k + servers out there that use the same cache (almost the same cache). I also like the old school look from Delta.</p>
<p>Hope you understand me.</p>
<p>Also I am not sure if it is allowed but does anyone know a ‘okay’ developer that can do this? I want to try to arrange a deal.</p>

<p>Your server looks very good. Only I really just want to use my server.</p>
