<p>Dude he just downloaded that and maybe he asked because he might change to shops or something else…<br>
Don’t just randomly say leecher if you don’t know that for sure. And don’t say that your a leecher, sometimes I leech to <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Alright I don’t but still, maybe that’s his starting source.</p>

              <p>Leeching is a touchy subject. Who’s to say what it actually is? Just because you download it, your called a lecher, well…why provide a download link? Leechers are actually people who take something and claim it as their own when they’ve made little or no changes. I would encourage people to download other servers and edit them, because you’re not experienced enough to make your own, so why not ‘borrow’ someone else’s while you learn how. As for people who say ‘if i don’t get enough posts, I’ll remove the link’ well they’re just fucktards. It’s always nice to receive congratulations for your work, but that’s just dumb. To get to a standard where people can immediately associate your user name with a good accomplishment, you have to do something that nobody else (or very few people) have done. Everyone makes private servers, so there’s rarely anything new to see.</p>
<p>I seem to have drifted a bit there. But my advice to all new comers;</p>
<p>Do something no-one (or few) has done, otherwise you won’t stand out. Nothing worth doing, is easy.</p>
