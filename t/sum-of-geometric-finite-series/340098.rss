    <title>Sum of Geometric Finite Series</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sum-of-geometric-finite-series/340098</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t exactly need help, I just need some advice. My class just started to sum finite geometric series, (sigma etc.) and I was starting to notice a pattern, besides the one that the book gave. The normal formula given, is:
[b]S[sub]n[/sub] = (t[sub]1[/sub](1 - r[sup]n[/sup])) / (1 - r)[/b]
-------------------------------------------
S[sub]n[/sub] being the sum of the series,
n being the number of terms,
r being the common ratio,
and t[sub]1[/sub] being the first term in the sequence.

I noticed that if you took the common ratio to the power of n (r[sup]n[/sup]), and r being 2 (2[sup]n[/sup])you were only a subtraction away from the sum of the series. To show my point:
1+2+4+8+16; r=2; t[sub]1[/sub]=1;n=5;
Using the normal formula (or your head), you get 31. But, r[sup]n[/sup] (2[sup]5[/sup]) = 32, and t[sub]1[/sub]=1.

I thought it was just coincidence. But I kept trying and trying, and I realized that this formula also works, as long as the ratio is 2:
[b]S[sub]n[/sub] = (r[sup]n[/sup])(t[sub]1[/sub]) - t[sub]1[/sub][/b]
I emailed my math teacher, and she said it was good, but that it didn&#39;t have much use if it only worked with r = 2. But I realized that[b] 
S[sub]n[/sub] = (r[sup]n[/sup])(t[sub]1[/sub]) - t[sub]1[/sub][/b] 
is the same as 
[b]S[sub]n[/sub] = ((r[sup]n[/sup])(t[sub]1[/sub]) - t[sub]1[/sub]) / 1[/b]
and r - 1 = 1. I then changed my formula to this:
[b]S[sub]n[/sub] = ((r[sup]n[/sup])(t[sub]1[/sub]) - t[sub]1[/sub]) / (r-1)[/b]

My question is, which formula would you use:
[b]S[sub]n[/sub] = (t[sub]1[/sub](1 - r[sup]n[/sup])) / (1 - r)[/b]
or
[b]S[sub]n[/sub] = ((r[sup]n[/sup])(t[sub]1[/sub]) - t[sub]1[/sub]) / (r-1)[/b]

Please explain why</description>

David’s saying that distributed equations are more efficient than ones that are factored. But if you’re given an equation and you need to solve for x, you can’t ‘save a step’, because that equation is either factored or not, etc.</p>

Obviously you misunderstood me, because I also gave another example:</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:24, topic:340098”]Just like you could factor a quadratic rather than use the quadratic formula.[/quote]Which is not just a factored equation.</p>
<p>And are you saying that going 1 block <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> the same as going 3 blocks? Because that is utterly retarded.</p>
<p>EDIT: EOD:</p>
<p>[quote=“Moparisthebest”]I believe you are all confusing work, and perhaps displacement.  You calculate work like this:</p>
<p>work = force * distance</p>
<p>Therefore, since going the long way around means longer distance, it means more work was done.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">However, the end result (maybe the correct word is displacement, but it’s late and I haven’t taken physics for years) is the same either way.</span>[/quote]</p><blockquote>You SAVE A STEP, but you STILL GET THE SAME ANSWER.</blockquote>

<p>Just a quick example - the remainder theorem is much faster (and maybe easier) than using long division to find if a given number is a factor. Is this not an example that goes against what you’re saying?[/quote]Just like you could factor a quadratic rather than use the quadratic formula.</p>
