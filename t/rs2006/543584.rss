    <description>First off I&#39;d like to say I take no credit for this, I&#39;m simply releasing for other people to use and make something out of this. I&#39;ve removed a lot of content, although I left the combat along with some of the basic stuff such as banking, shopping, trading; however all skills, functions (things like doors, object clicking, etc...) have been cleaned and removed.

There is a small anti-leech in here; very basic java knowledge will fix it.

Please do [B][I]not[/I][/B] post the anti-leech fix, thank you.

              <p>There is no point to post this if you removed all that content, that’s the only thing that made the server special. The design was not special or good at all.</p>
<p>Also you shouldn’t release others work without their permission, especially putting your own stupid antileech in.</p>
