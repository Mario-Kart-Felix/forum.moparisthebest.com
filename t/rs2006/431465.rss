<p>3 years is a long time for playing Runescape…[/quote]<br>
But if you played for 3 years, you haven’t experienced the true runescape, Like the fun things.<br>
For example Falador massacre.<br>
No grand exchange (so it was more challenging to get items)<br>
The players were much nicer…<br>
And Jagex actually made good Updates.</p>

I remember an interview about a year or two ago Andrew Gower did, and the question was brought up about a early runescape 2 revision being made.He mentioned that he liked the idea, but he didn’t know if it was going to happen.<br>
Just wanted to point that out.</p>
