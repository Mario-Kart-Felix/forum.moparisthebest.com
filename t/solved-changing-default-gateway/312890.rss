    <title>[solved] Changing default gateway</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-changing-default-gateway/312890</link>
    <description>[s]Would it be possible to assign the default gateway manually but configure the rest of the ip settings using DHCP on windows. The reason I want to do this is because I want to be able to host a webserver on this computer when I need it and be able to browse the internet normally.

My only choice at the moment is to find a public dsn server (I have tried a few but not many work) and configure everything manually.

Basically, I am an idiot and just realised that when I connect to my external IP it brings me to my router page and when everyone else does it goes onto my web server  :P</description>
