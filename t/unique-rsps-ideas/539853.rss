    <title>Unique RSPS Ideas</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unique-rsps-ideas/539853</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for a few ideas of a &quot;theme&quot; for an rsps, examples are Rome 718 is based on rome and End Point - Apocalyptic Survival is based on zombies. Reason I want this is so I can make something unique and fun for both me and the people playing. For me it&#39;s hard to find a fun rsps now a days because they all are the same and have been the same for a while now. If you have a few ideas that could be added to the server aswell please make sure to post them. If you have a preferred revision feel free to post that as that isn&#39;t decided yet either.

Thanks in advanced to anyone who helps.</description>

<p>You need something new, not many people worry about the map due to the fact most people like the Runescape map.<br>
Some simple things I always see missing are:</p>
<p>-Complete Map<br>
-Simple/Complex Quests: Something that we will appreciate.<br>
-Inventive AI: Sick of old “Stand there and butcher him AI” Make us fear enemies.<br>
-Thought/A Plan: Most servers are put together by 6 or more people so there’s very rarely a plan.</p>
<p>Some ideas that might get the juices flowin:<br>
Undead Cities, Demon caves, OH No!, Gods, Defence, Work[/quote]<br>

<p>Thanks for the reply, as Arham said I got good replies from rune-server, I was more looking for ideas from people who weren’t developing something but had a good idea I guess, or people who can’t program and wanted something cool and fun added to a server they wanted to play.</p>
