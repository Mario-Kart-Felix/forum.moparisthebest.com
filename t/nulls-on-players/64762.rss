I tried Miss Silabsoft&#39;s guide to completely getting rid of nulls, but it hasnt worked for this issue, all help is appreciated, THANKS!</description>

              <p>i got the same thing on my server, turns out, when i compiled it said 2 errors, well guess what? i had 2 nulls under ::players. i fixed the errors and they never came back, excuse me for assuming thats what caused a null, ffs</p>

              <p>Le Hawtz ur a noob, it’s not an error!! A null is something that goes in your server to check if your server is online, 80% of the time nulls are created by adding your server to server lists and stuff like that, the server list system then sends a null to your server, and then the null sends a back to the server list system and it says is your server is either online or offline. To get rid of nulls 75% of the time, look for tuts on these forums.</p>

              <p>it’s errors in the coding, a perminant fix would take FOREVER, unless you add an anti null code, for a temp fix restart the server (“x” out the runserver and re open it)</p>
