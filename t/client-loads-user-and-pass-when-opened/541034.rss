              <p>[quote=“xX4m4zingXx, post:3, topic:526844”]i think it saves in the cache<br>
in my cache it has a file named: saveuser.ini<br>
go into a file that looks something like this ^<br>
and then search the username and pass and then empty it<br>
then make a package from the cache and upload it so it will be<br>
empty when you first play your server[/quote]</p>

              <p>Deathlypvp loads your pass and name to cache txt file to keep them recorded. (You can check it by going in cache and read the .txt file)<br>
Delete the way how it saves it there and you are good to go.</p>
