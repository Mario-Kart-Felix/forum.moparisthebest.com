    <title>Client that works with dreamscape?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-that-works-with-dreamscape/431282</link>
    <description>I need a client that works with dreamscape because I have a client error where 64bit users cannot run it and I know its inside the client files. I have no idea how to fix and no one will help so I need a new client.

Please tell me the name or give a link.

Thanks,
vex.</description>
