    <title>Items in shops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/items-in-shops/353071</link>
    <description>I recently made a new shop. The problem is that whenever someone buys them, their money doesn&#39;t go down. 
It&#39;s quite annoying since people are just spam buying from the shops and ruining the little economy my pking server has.
Could anyone help with this problem?</description>

              <p>i see 2 things here.</p>
<p>first would be that your item prices are set to 0</p>
<p>second is your buy value which in my opinion is - 0%</p>
