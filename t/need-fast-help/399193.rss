    <title>Need Fast Help (;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-fast-help/399193</link>
    <description>Okay, really lame question. I need a fast answer to this too, ok so I killed a guy at green drags about 5 mins ago and he had a multicannon. Don&#39;t ask me why. The cannon has stayed there for 5 mins now. Will it ever get to the point where me and my friend can grab the cannon? Or what happens from here..</description>

              <p>This belongs in the General Questions section. If you have a cannon you never lose it-if you die with it you can get it back</p>
<p>somewhere near Barbarian Village, hard to explain exactly where it is. You can look it up though.</p>
