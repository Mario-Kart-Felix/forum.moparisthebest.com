    <title>I need my npcs to stop attacking you when you walk away!</title>

    <description>Ok so with my server the npcs used to follow you if you ran away from them and continue attacking you. If you teled away it would walk through the walls toward you and just like stop in the wall and others cant reach it. I made it so if you take more than 1 step away from it it&#39;ll stop attacking you but now when you go back up to it it continues to attack you...People team on my Jad and the first person to hit it gets hit by Jad. If that person leaves and the other player is still attacking it, it doesn&#39;t attack the other player. How do I fix this?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 15, 2008, 12:43:45 pm[/size][hr]I need to make it so when you take that step away, the npc totally cancels..meaning it stops wanting to attack you altogether until you hit it again.</description>
