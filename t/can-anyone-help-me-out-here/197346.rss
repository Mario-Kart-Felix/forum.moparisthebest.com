    <title>Can anyone help me out here?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-anyone-help-me-out-here/197346</link>
    <description>I am having trouble with my NPC&#39;s talking. I do everything right, log in, talk to my NPC and when my charcter is supposed to talk back, it logs me out. Is there anyway someone can tell me what I am doing wrong? My compiler has no error&#39;s.

Basically what I did was I made an NPC talk on my server and it compiled good. I made it so the NPC would say something and I would click continue and the player would respond, but the player doesn&#39;t respond. After the NPC talk&#39;s to me and I click continue it logs me straight out. Can someone please help me with this and tell me what I am doing wrong?</description>
