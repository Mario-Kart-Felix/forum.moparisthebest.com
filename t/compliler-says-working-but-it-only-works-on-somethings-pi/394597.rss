    <description>I just started coding this [pi] source and [pi] is very new to me and this is my first 1. well i changed java version so the compiler that is in folder with files that apear soon as you open source folder would work and it does. 
but some reason only compiles some of the files, i think its only compiling the files in data, i need to compile my commands + xp rates which is in src. folder.. please help</description>
