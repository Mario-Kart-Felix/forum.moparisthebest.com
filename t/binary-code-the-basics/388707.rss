    <description>[b]What is Binary Code?[/b]
Binary Code is a sequence of numbers your computer can understand, you might think your computer can understand languages such as Java and C++ but thats not quite right. Your computer can only understand machine code, which is where Binary comes into place.

[b]Binary in Numbers[/b]
As with every language comes a few rules, in Binary you must read from right to left, the first value will be one, the second is 2 and the third is 4 and so on. Do you see a pattern? Yes its just doubling the number over and over. In Binary you would see it like this http://i54.tinypic.com/2a9zon5.png
Simply 1=yes/on and a 0=no/off
Example: http://i51.tinypic.com/oe7ih.png the values with the number 1 under them are the ones you want, and the values with the number 0 under them are the ones you didn&#39;t want
Now if you use a calculator to add up all the values with the numbers with 1s under them (and only the 1s) your answer should be 57
So 32+16+8+1

Btw, 0s that are before your last 1 will not be needed. so 0001000 will just be 1000
[hr]

[b]Binary Code in words[/b] [size=6pt]Or is this ASCII? Stupid me wasn&#39;t bright enough to know what I was learning in class[/size]
Binary Code is simple, its just 1s and 0s
Example, I will say &#39;HELLO WORLD&#39; in Binary
[code]01001000 01000101 01001100 01001100 01001111 00100000 01010111 01001111 01010010 01001100 01000100[/code]

You can find a full list of Binary Codes [url=http://www.tekmom.com/buzzwords/binaryalphabet.html]here[/url]

When you type a letter on your computer you are inputting instructions for your computer to follow. Say I type the letter &#39;M&#39; the computer will read it as 01001101
Or if I type &#39;m&#39; the computer will read 01101101, do you see the difference?
[hr]


I am at this moment learning more about Binary, I will try to update this every time I learn something new. And when I get the confidence that I know enough to post a tutorial about ASCII I might just do it.</description>
