    <title>Menu Options/Actions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/menu-options-actions/323769</link>
    <description>Today is the last day before I go back to school after holidays and out of a combination of boredom and intrigue I decided to see if I could resurrect a small project I was working on before I stopped taking an interest in the client.

The only thing right now that is still screwy is when I am attempting to handle a &quot;menu&quot; in runescape.

Previously, there were two String[] in the client (or, before that two StringWrapper[]) that were commonly referred to as &quot;menuOptions&quot; and &quot;menuActions&quot; and when parsed appropriately together these two fields allowed you to reconstruct the menu.

However, it appears that in more recent revisions (I&#39;m not sure how recent), these fields have either been removed or are no longer in use by the cheating scene.  My updater can&#39;t find them which surprised me but I also realized that could just mean a broken &quot;hook&quot;.  So, I went to view some other updater outputs, and realized it wasn&#39;t in anyones.  However I did notice something which i believe to be new, the accessors called &quot;getMenuOption&quot; and &quot;getMenuAction&quot; which both return a String.

My question is simple really, what happened to them, and what can I use as an alternative?</description>
