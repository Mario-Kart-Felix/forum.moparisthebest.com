<p>In the Customer Relations team we have over two thirds of our Moderators dedicated to processing your abuse reports as quickly as possible, as well as dealing with macro users and real world traders. Jagex Moderators are also assigned to tracking where the profits of cheating have gone, resulting in the banning not only of scam accounts but also of the main accounts of those who persist in scamming. In addition to this, we are constantly recruiting honest player moderators to help us to identify and remove disruptive elements from the game.</p>
<p>Beyond the Customer Relations team our Content team is constantly looking into ways to alter the game itself to reduce the ability for people to cheat, for example the recent creation of the Bank PINs and the essence mine changes.</p>
<p>The main source of information on rule breakers comes from you - our players. Every abuse report we receive is actioned accordingly and will be recorded on the offending player’s permanent record. Processing the abuse reports cannot be done instantly, and action taken happens behind the scenes, so we cannot guarantee that you will always see the offending player being removed from the game - however the good news is that we are now more successful than ever at processing abuse reports quickly and seeking to educate players. Those who are not willing to be educated are removed.</p>
<p>So if you are a honest player, you can do your bit to help all this by sending in Abuse Reports whenever you see someone breaking the rules. You can also help yourself by keeping both your account and your PC safe - advice on how to do this being found in the Knowledge Base.</p>
<p>And if you’re a dishonest player you can do your bit by stopping breaking the rules now.</p>
<p>We will find you and we will ban you if you don’t play by our rules.</p>
<hr>
<p>The below text is all opinionated and shouldn’t be taken offensive to anyone. If you have a problem with my rhetoric simply don’t read it, or reply sensibly stating why I am full of myself. Forgive typos or inconsistencies–this was typed in a state of realization without editing.</p>
<p>Yesterday shall be the last time I ever log into Runescape.</p>
<p>I am gladly throwing away a lvl 98 account with over 30M in items and an investment of 2 years.</p>
<p>It has become increasingly obvious that the sole purpose of this game is to make real-world money for a select amount of individuals. This is accomplished by creating serious addictions to the amount of enjoyment and entertainment that is afforded by the game. Yet, in making such a game so attractive, it has alienated its users from external reality; the one filled with learning, friends, adventure, and happiness.</p>
<p>It is amazing how the complexities of humanity is expressed in this simple javascript game. Dominance hierarchies, territorial tendencies, and wealth status that we see in so many Western countries is perfectly portrayed by fancy items, gold coins, quest points, stats, etc. And unlike in real life where final accomplishments can eventually be obtained, there is techinically no end to the amount of “experience” (XP) or money that you can earn in Runescape.</p>
<p>The sad thing is we only get one shot at life; everyone is going to die and the only reflection of the quality of your existence is the effort that you put into making positive changes in your own life and those of others. “Experience” does not include clicking a single pixel for a fabricated reason.</p>
<p>Yet, the people at Jagex are getting rich off of convincing (mostly young) people that there is something to be gained from Runescape other than bragging rights or a cheap elimination of boredom. Hell, parents gladly dish out $5 a month to pacify their children into a passive vegetative state that causes them little problems.</p>
<p>Millions upon millions of real individuals live and die everyday in a horrendous state of dispair. Poor nutrition, poor education, war, disease, etc. riddle a huge chunk of our population. We can’t all save the world by depositing pennies at McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, but we can certainly be conscious about how our decisions and behaviors affect the rest of the world. Not only could the millions of dollars that Jagex officials pocket be spent on something a little more resourceful, we could all dedicate our time to something more productive than a bright computer screen and a world that only exists on a technological server.</p>
<p>I am quitting because Runescape, the economy and the officials, is a mirror image of a fascist regime that is obsessed with coercively manipulating its citizens into being loyal. It has become way too frightening to log into a dimension where the cartoons I see are real people who are blind against the REAL game.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------well he is so good with the words! i give a ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ this really showed me the light after playing runescape for 4 years omg! i could pay this dude 100 $ i wont but i should he has helped me so much omg! i know i’m too heste gotta go</p>
