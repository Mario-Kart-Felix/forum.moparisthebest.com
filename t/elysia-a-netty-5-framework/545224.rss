    <title>Elysia - A netty 5 framework</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/elysia-a-netty-5-framework/545224</link>
    <description>[size=16pt][b]Elsyia - A netty 5 framework by RandQm[/b][/size]



I wanted to write a netty 5 framework for a while but failed in doing so.
When I saw Vix was writing one as well I wanted to try again, I was first going to reference it from him,
but after all a programmer has it&#39;s own style and it wouldn&#39;t feel good so I ended up writing it myself.

[b]At the moment this includes:[/b]
  - Logging in
  - Outgoing packet system
  - Incoming packet system
  - Control panel (I love control panels)

I also plan on expanding this to an actual working server to build content on.
I&#39;m now finished with the login framework itself which you can find under github here:
https://github.com/randqm/Elysia-framework

And you can also download it from the download section:

[b]For any more information don&#39;t hesitate to ask.
And keep the &quot;this is bad&quot; comments out, instead post constructive criticism.[/b]


[b]edit:[/b] You might think where the logger, task system and attributes class are coming from when looking through the code.
Those are libraries from myself which I use over multiple projects, the jars can be downloaded with source code included together
with the project in the downloads sections: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,664105.0.html

<p>I’m not going to sugar coat it for you, this is a pile of ass that no one really needs or wants. As if someone woke up one day and said “holy fudge, I wish I had a barebones netty 5 RSPS that only has packet handling complete and a nifty little control panel”.</p>

Why would I need to have had projects at the top to be allowed to share my project? Why would I need to contribute to a revision I’m not interested in because you are?<br>

This is moparscape, not a professional programmers forum, so act to it. I’m at least doing my best writing something myself and learning, what can’t be said of the biggest part of this community here.

Do you have specific study in computer science related subjects other than training in languages?<br>

I also studied computer techniques, no degree for that as I failed the hardware part.<br>

I have a <span class="bbcode-b">college degree programming .NET and Java</span>, sure I lack experience as I didn’t work in a professional environment yet but you guys act like you’re fudgeing pro’s and that I’m just changing numbers in a PI. This is moparscape, not a professional programmers forum, so act to it. I’m at least doing my best writing something myself and learning, what can’t be said of the biggest part of this community here. How about you told me what is good and what is wrong and how it should be done better instead of just saying hur dur this is bad I could do this better but I don’t because I rather wine.<br>

<p>So what are you, certified?[/quote]<br>
I don’t know what compares to your american school system but I attended school after high school for my programming degree which included as main languages <a href="http://VB.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.NET</a>, C#.NET and Java</p>
