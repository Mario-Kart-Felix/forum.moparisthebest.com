    <description>Anyone wanting to play some minecraft on ps3? I was pretty hyped when it came, and bought it instantly but tbh havent played any more than 5 minutes of it. Anyone wanting to play just add me &quot;whosNeri&quot; can also play all kinds of cod, etc. Also I really only like survival, so don&#39;t add me if your a creative only type of person.</description>
