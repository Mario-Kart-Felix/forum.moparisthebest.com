<p>If you believe that then I’ll let you believe that. I’ve tried to prove my side of it, just because the war is there it doesn’t mean there aren’t other factors and 3rd party organisations working in there. It’s merely a handful of soldiers causing an issue and people like you get the wrong end of the stick.</p>

<p>Perhaps you don’t know it Ruby but I lost a dear friend to the war. Because of what? Because of idiots like you, people who believe that this war should be going on. People like you, who believe we can change and make something new in a country we have no right to be in.</p>
<p>Don’t try to argue this with me you will not get anywhere.[/quote]</p>
<p>You lost one friend? I lost several close friends and comrades of which I went in the field with including my uncle through the inside of their own operations. Don’t you sit there and tell me what should and shouldn’t be happening. If you were in any way shape or form informed of what is going on out there you’d know that the Americans are actually pulling out bit by bit. They’re taking all funding from 3rd party companies by April of next year and then gradually pulling troops out by the province.</p>
<p>Idiots like me? My father and his company have put millions upon millions into the intelligence forces of Afghanistan and acting as a liaison into getting those agents trained and minimizing the corruption throughout that entire sector. So if you’d like to sit there and fucking tell me we aren’t making a difference after building several foundations of huge projects which has brought leaps and bounds upon throughout Afghanistan.</p>
<p>If you truly believe we are making no difference out there you are hideously ill-informed and if you seriously think you can sit there and think you’ve got it bad because you lost a friend while I’ve had men killed by their own die right beside me out there, you’re a good few years older than me and I honestly thought you were more mature but you’ve disproved that over the past hour, you are completely and utterly stubborn on the point. There’s much worse than what I’ve seen and what I’ve said, it’s a lot bigger than one person, Alison, a lot bigger.</p>
<p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:35, topic:466286”]“Soldiers are there because they’re representing their countries, they don’t challenge the motives behind it or not openly at least.”<br>
Thank you. This is why I don’t think we should respect the troops. It is such people who have stood for the most evil in the last centuries. Hitler, Napoleon, Franz Joseph I of Austria and Wilhelm II was nothing without their loyal armies.[/quote]</p>
<p>You can’t compare the Afghanistan war to anything of the such Hitler, Napoleon, Franz Joseph I and Wilhem II has done, they were true massacres. You wouldn’t understand until you’ve actually went out there, you’d then realise that it’s a very, very small percentage of the troops that are out there that cause issues.</p>

<p>Not the ones I dealt with, no. They didn’t question anything, they did as they were told when they were told and had nothing to complain about. What they do is their job and they follow the orders precisely as given.</p>
<p>I can’t answer for all the troops, of course. However, I can say that if a troop was complaining while he was over there he’d be put in his place by his fellow soldiers or commanding officer. A warzone is no place for people who complain.<br>

I didn’t say complaining about stuff. I’m asking if anyone questioned the motives of the war.<br>
You seem to have confirmed my point. US soldiers are mindless drones who follow orders and do not question why they fight.</p>

Sorry, I misunderstood you on that point. However, no; they don’t disagree with the motives of the war they’re fighting in. Say you’re a police officer and you’ve just stopped someone with drugs on them and they say they’re selling the drugs for money to fund a charity, would you disagree with arresting that person? No, it’s their job. That person is still breaking the law no matter the motive. Soldiers are there because they’re representing their countries, they don’t challenge the motives behind it or not openly at least.</p>

<p>Just because you shouldn’t be there in the first place doesn’t change the fact they are there. I know they shouldn’t be there, most of the population know we shouldn’t be there but we are. It’s something that happened and believe it or not they are helping over there.</p>

<p>People may well have morals but when they’re dealing in a warzone they do what they’re told when they’re told. If they refuse they’re simply removed form their position. Don’t be so idiotic to believe something such as that.</p>
<p>For example: You’re driving through Khost(the most dangerous province in Afghanistan) and you encounter a taliban set up road block. These road blocks are set up to kill any form of law or intelligence enforcement. If your commanding officer orders you to shoot on site and you refuse you’ve just cost that entire convoy their lives and deprived their families of that person.</p>
<p>If you honestly believe that people who disobey orders on the field are just overlooked and they’re actually willing to talk about what they’ve done and what they’ve been through then you’re incredibly ill-informed.</p>

When you spend several months of your life in Afghanistan working with the NDS and QRF I can guarantee you every single US, British, French, Italian and German troop I seen whether it be in Khost, Quandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-sharif, Kabul or any of the several provinces and cities I visited had followed and stuck to the Geneva convention like glue. There is a very very very small minority of troops who sadly do perform acts that are unspeakable on innocent by-standers and they are <span class="bbcode-i">always</span> caught and will be dishonorably discharged more times than not. People like you are the people who give them the recognition they don’t deserve. You as a person who has never visited Afghanistan(excuse me using Afghanistan frequently) and been in the heart of the native forces and see the troops from all over the world helping wouldn’t understand. If the troops who are there doing their job and helping where possible then Afghanistan would be a very, very worse off place.</p>
<p>Like I said; you haven’t spent months of your life with the NDS and QRF, these are the elite forces that Afghanistan have to offer. You’ve now shown me that you’re the kind of completely idiotic person who stereotypes people just because a very small handful of troops have performed dishonorable acts in the past.</p>
