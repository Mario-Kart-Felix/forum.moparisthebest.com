<p>Actually going over seas and fighting because you love your country is different then having big ass balls to go over seas and get shot at to make 15$ an hour</p>

You can’t have respect for those mindless drones who kills without question. It is good that they suffer so it might deter people from travelling to the middle-east to kill in the next imperialist war.</p>

<p>You have no fucking idea what you’re talking about so please, please shut up. Until you’ve been in a position of where it’s needed you will never, ever understand.</p>
<p>The two of you have just lost all respect I’ve ever had for you and your knowledge in the past 30 seconds. Unless you’ve been in a very, very active warzone and realised what those men and women do you will not understand and you will not truly respect them. Killing without question never happens, under the geneva convention <span class="bbcode-b">no</span> soldier nor civilian can fire unless fire upon. If you honestly are such a complete idiot that you believe people go out there just for killing and come back the same person then you’re sorely mistaken. The first time you step on to the warzone soil you completely change.</p>

My point is that you travel down to Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya without questioning why you fight this illegitimate wars. The military is based on this concept. You have orders to fulfil and you shouldn’t not question them.</p>
<p>And no wonder why people shoots at you. YOU ARE FUCKING INVADING THEM!. It isn’t stand your ground to shoot the person you rape if she/he try to stab you.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
“f you honestly are such a complete idiot that you believe people go out there just for killing and come back the same person”<br>
I didn’t say they came down there because they like to murder civilians, and I didn’t claim that they do not suffer from their experience. I just say they deserve that suffering for what they do.</p>

When you spend several months of your life in Afghanistan working with the NDS and QRF I can guarantee you every single US, British, French, Italian and German troop I seen whether it be in Khost, Quandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-sharif, Kabul or any of the several provinces and cities I visited had followed and stuck to the Geneva convention like glue. There is a very very very small minority of troops who sadly do perform acts that are unspeakable on innocent by-standers and they are <span class="bbcode-i">always</span> caught and will be dishonorably discharged more times than not. People like you are the people who give them the recognition they don’t deserve. You as a person who has never visited Afghanistan(excuse me using Afghanistan frequently) and been in the heart of the native forces and see the troops from all over the world helping wouldn’t understand. If the troops who are there doing their job and helping where possible then Afghanistan would be a very, very worse off place.</p>
<p>Like I said; you haven’t spent months of your life with the NDS and QRF, these are the elite forces that Afghanistan have to offer. You’ve now shown me that you’re the kind of completely idiotic person who stereotypes people just because a very small handful of troops have performed dishonorable acts in the past.</p>
<p>Do not try and prove your point against something you know nothing about other than stories.</p>

<p>Not the ones I dealt with, no. They didn’t question anything, they did as they were told when they were told and had nothing to complain about. What they do is their job and they follow the orders precisely as given.</p>
<p>I can’t answer for all the troops, of course. However, I can say that if a troop was complaining while he was over there he’d be put in his place by his fellow soldiers or commanding officer. A warzone is no place for people who complain.</p>

<p>People may well have morals but when they’re dealing in a warzone they do what they’re told when they’re told. If they refuse they’re simply removed form their position. Don’t be so idiotic to believe something such as that.</p>
<p>For example: You’re driving through Khost(the most dangerous province in Afghanistan) and you encounter a taliban set up road block. These road blocks are set up to kill any form of law or intelligence enforcement. If your commanding officer orders you to shoot on site and you refuse you’ve just cost that entire convoy their lives and deprived their families of that person.</p>
<p>If you honestly believe that people who disobey orders on the field are just overlooked and they’re actually willing to talk about what they’ve done and what they’ve been through then you’re incredibly ill-informed.</p>

Sorry, I misunderstood you on that point. However, no; they don’t disagree with the motives of the war they’re fighting in. Say you’re a police officer and you’ve just stopped someone with drugs on them and they say they’re selling the drugs for money to fund a charity, would you disagree with arresting that person? No, it’s their job. That person is still breaking the law no matter the motive. Soldiers are there because they’re representing their countries, they don’t challenge the motives behind it or not openly at least.</p>

<p>Just because you shouldn’t be there in the first place doesn’t change the fact they are there. I know they shouldn’t be there, most of the population know we shouldn’t be there but we are. It’s something that happened and believe it or not they are helping over there.</p>

<p>You lost one friend? I lost several close friends and comrades of which I went in the field with including my uncle through the inside of their own operations. Don’t you sit there and tell me what should and shouldn’t be happening. If you were in any way shape or form informed of what is going on out there you’d know that the Americans are actually pulling out bit by bit. They’re taking all funding from 3rd party companies by April of next year and then gradually pulling troops out by the province.</p>
<p>Idiots like me? My father and his company have put millions upon millions into the intelligence forces of Afghanistan and acting as a liaison into getting those agents trained and minimizing the corruption throughout that entire sector. So if you’d like to sit there and fucking tell me we aren’t making a difference after building several foundations of huge projects which has brought leaps and bounds upon throughout Afghanistan.</p>
<p>If you truly believe we are making no difference out there you are hideously ill-informed and if you seriously think you can sit there and think you’ve got it bad because you lost a friend while I’ve had men killed by their own die right beside me out there, you’re a good few years older than me and I honestly thought you were more mature but you’ve disproved that over the past hour, you are completely and utterly stubborn on the point. There’s much worse than what I’ve seen and what I’ve said, it’s a lot bigger than one person, Alison, a lot bigger.</p>

<p>You can’t compare the Afghanistan war to anything of the such Hitler, Napoleon, Franz Joseph I and Wilhem II has done, they were true massacres. You wouldn’t understand until you’ve actually went out there, you’d then realise that it’s a very, very small percentage of the troops that are out there that cause issues.</p>

<p>If you believe that then I’ll let you believe that. I’ve tried to prove my side of it, just because the war is there it doesn’t mean there aren’t other factors and 3rd party organisations working in there. It’s merely a handful of soldiers causing an issue and people like you get the wrong end of the stick.</p>
