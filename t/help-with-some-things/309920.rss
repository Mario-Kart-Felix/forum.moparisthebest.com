    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-some-things/309920</link>
    <description>I had found this at other forum but i don&#39;t says where i have to add it :/ so maybe you could help my with this...

This is the tutorial whitch i had found.
[code=javascript]
Difficulty: 2/10 - just need to know what declaring is &gt;.&gt;
Files modified: Client.java
Length: 30 seconds tops.
-------------------
1.
-------------------
Open up client.java

Declare

CODE
private String illegalNames[] = {&quot;~&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, &quot;#&quot;, &quot;$&quot;, &quot;%&quot;, &quot;^&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;(&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;, &quot;{&quot;, &quot;}&quot;, &quot;|&quot;, &quot;`&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;SYI&quot;, &quot;  &quot;, &quot;__&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;mod&quot;, &quot;owner&quot;, &quot;ass&quot;, &quot;bitch&quot;, &quot;fuck&quot;, &quot;shit&quot;};

You can add more things in that also.
-------------------
2.
-------------------
Go to your initialize void - &gt; for dumb people
CODE
public void initialize() {

Add.

CODE
if (playerName.length() &gt;= 13)
{
disconnected = true;
appendToBanned(playerName);
}
    //block against unwanted characters/strings in names
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; illegalNames.length; i++) {
        if (playerName.contains(illegalNames[i]) || playerName.endsWith(&quot; &quot;) || playerName.startsWith(&quot; &quot;)) {
            appendToBanned(playerName);
            checkbannedusers();
            logout();
            System.out.println(playerName+&quot; - banned for use of an illegal name.&quot;);
        }
    }
    //block against repeating characters done to make it hard to ban/kick
    char[] name = playerName.toCharArray();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; name.length-2; i++) { // -2 because we check +2 in the if
        if (name[i] == name[i+1] &amp;&amp; name[i+1] == name[i+2]) {
            appendToBanned(playerName);
            checkbannedusers();
            logout();
            System.out.println(playerName+&quot; - banned for use of repeating characters.&quot;);
        }
    }

Okay guys...

What this does..

CODE
    //block against repeating characters done to make it hard to ban/kick
    char[] name = playerName.toCharArray();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; name.length-2; i++) { // -2 because we check +2 in the if
        if (name[i] == name[i+1] &amp;&amp; name[i+1] == name[i+2]) {
            appendToBanned(playerName);
            checkbannedusers();
            logout();
            System.out.println(playerName+&quot; - banned for use of repeating characters.&quot;);
        }
    }

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
That makes it so if they use the name like ggggggggg

they get banned so you don&#39;t have to count how many characters. But as you see the
CODE
+2
They can still have names like.. - &gt; Dogg or.. Cool

Credits:
Creds to links bro for the length.. i&#39;m pretty sure.. its very easy now for me, but he told us it a while back..
There was a tut way back i put in my client.java, i used and now here it is for you.
And cod4 found the person who made it a while back, tankyou &gt;.&gt; (tj007razor)[/code]

I&#39;m using Delta-scape and i don&#39;t know where shud by this code:

[code=javascript]private String illegalNames[] = {&quot;~&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, &quot;#&quot;, &quot;$&quot;, &quot;%&quot;, &quot;^&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;(&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;, &quot;{&quot;, &quot;}&quot;, &quot;|&quot;, &quot;`&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;SYI&quot;, &quot;  &quot;, &quot;__&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;mod&quot;, &quot;owner&quot;, &quot;ass&quot;, &quot;bitch&quot;, &quot;fuck&quot;, &quot;shit&quot;};[/code]

And when i add some other 2. i get errors. If it will be needed i will post the sreenshot of it...

The last qoustion is what does this code:

[code=javascript]	public void initialize() {
	 if(playerName.length() &gt; MAX_CHARACTERS-1) {
                	writeLog(playerName, &quot;bans&quot;);
                	 disconnected = true;
                	 misc.println(new StringBuilder(playerName).append(&quot; was disconnected and banned - &quot; +
                	 		&quot;name longer than 14 characters ! (&quot;).append(connectedFrom).append(&quot;)&quot;).toString());
                	 longAttempts.put(connectedFrom, longNameAttempts++);
                	 
                	 if(longAttempts.get(connectedFrom) &gt; MAX_ATTEMPTS-1) {
                		 writeLog(playerLastConnect, &quot;ipbans&quot;);
                		 misc.println(new StringBuilder(playerName).append(&quot; was IP banned, used characters &quot; +
                		 		&quot;longer that the allowed limit (&quot;).append(MAX_CHARACTERS).append(&quot;) &quot; +
                		 				&quot;more than &quot;).append(MAX_ATTEMPTS).append(&quot; times.&quot;).toString());
                		 longNameAttempts = 0;
                	 }
			}[/code]

I tooked it from mines client.java ... I gues if player name is longer than 14 characters it gets ip ban??? IDK</description>
