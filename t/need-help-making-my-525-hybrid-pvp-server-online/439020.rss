    <description>Well i made my own server with an insidiax source and client.
I spent alot of time editing it and coding to fix it up how i wanted it to be
I watched a vid on youtube on how to portforward , and im pretty sure i did it right..
what do i do next? how do i get it online? how do i get a client download for my players to go on , and do i have to change the ip adress in the folder gui.java from local host to my ip adress for people to connect to?</description>
