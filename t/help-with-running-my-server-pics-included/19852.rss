              <p>why do u use<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_09\bin\javac.exe”?</p>
<p>why not set your JAVA PATH in Environment Variables and just use</p>
<p><code>@echo off
COLOR 08
title Compile
javac.exe -cp . *.java
pause</code></p>
<p>might fix problems searching the file</p>
<p>edit:<br>
ok to set your java path you have to right click My Computer<br>
go to Properties -&gt; Advanced tab</p>
<p>in System variables groupbox  go look in that Listbox for Path Variable and double click it</p>
<p>you will see something like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;C:\Program Files\ATI Technologies\ATI Control Panel;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\80\Tools\Binn\;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\90\Tools\binn\;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_09\bin;%XMLBEANS_HOME%\bin</code></pre>
<p>simply add a ; in the end of that and type<br>
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_09\bin</p>

              <p>… um… well for one, after you moded your compiler, you should have ran it in the folder named “java” (if you have one, which since it has a class error that states that it can’t find bob.class I’d figure that you have one) It would have created a bunch of .class files which you stick in the Class folder… then… your server should run… maybe…</p>
<p>probably not…</p>
