    <description>I remember on my v2 i tried a server side health bar, didn&#39;t work so well.

I&#39;ve decided to add to my V3 HUB, by adding a player health bar that replaces the tiny one that shows over your character.

Also, i&#39;ve attempted a Player Vs bar as well, ( well sorta )

The plan is, when ive worked out all the differences,

Your HP bar is always on the top left hand corner of the screen. 

This ensures that you always know what your HP is. Also you dont have to deal with random people&#39;s text blocking your Tiny hp bar.
The HP bar is much bigger so the chance of red barring is slimmer then with the old one, so no more thinking your dead. 

The lay out of the Player vs bar is pretty simple, it gives a more accurate look at your opponent&#39;s Hp, to know how much more you have to kill them lol.

But hippie, what about all the other players around you with hp bars over head?  
Well, since their not a true priority to you ( yet ) their bar just stays over head.

The redbard man, will have the hp bar over his head becuase wasn&#39;t fighting him at the time


Now, that random compass you see on the middle left, that&#39;s there becuase well, I placed it there. This is only to show you it can easily be done. 
Now what if some one wanted to create a boarder around the game frame: Easy, the client reject&#39;s the color white from showing, so you could make the boarder in a file the same size as the game screen, and fill it in with white, and tada you have a cool boarder. 

This can also be usefull for making a custom box or something, in my case, a box around my hub and HP bar. 

Interesting no?

I&#39;ll update this post as I go along.

If anyone has any sugestions, feed back or any advice I&#39;d be glad to hear it.</description>

The top right hand bar shows other player’s attacking on, I need to develop a method for showing only someone YOUR attacking in the top right.<br>

              <p>I remember on my v2 i tried a server side health bar, didn’t work so well.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to add to my V3 HUB, by adding a player health bar that replaces the tiny one that shows over your character.</p>
<p>Also, i’ve attempted a Player Vs bar as well, ( well sorta )</p>
<p>The plan is, when ive worked out all the differences,</p>
<p>Your HP bar is always on the top left hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p>This ensures that you always know what your HP is. Also you dont have to deal with random people’s text blocking your Tiny hp bar.<br>
The HP bar is much bigger so the chance of red barring is slimmer then with the old one, so no more thinking your dead.</p>
<p>The lay out of the Player vs bar is pretty simple, it gives a more accurate look at your opponent’s Hp, to know how much more you have to kill them lol.</p>
<p>But hippie, what about all the other players around you with hp bars over head?<br>
Well, since their not a true priority to you ( yet ) their bar just stays over head.</p>
<p><img src="http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff6/mprock3/HPBARS.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><img src="http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff6/mprock3/Show2.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The redbard man, will have the hp bar over his head becuase wasn’t fighting him at the time</p>
<p>Now, that random compass you see on the middle left, that’s there becuase well, I placed it there. This is only to show you it can easily be done.<br>
Now what if some one wanted to create a boarder around the game frame: Easy, the client reject’s the color white from showing, so you could make the boarder in a file the same size as the game screen, and fill it in with white, and tada you have a cool boarder.</p>
<p>This can also be usefull for making a custom box or something, in my case, a box around my hub and HP bar.</p>
<p>Interesting no?</p>
<p>I’ll update this post as I go along.</p>
<p>If anyone has any sugestions, feed back or any advice I’d be glad to hear it.</p>
