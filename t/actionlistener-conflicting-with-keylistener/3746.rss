    <title>ActionListener conflicting with KeyListener?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/actionlistener-conflicting-with-keylistener/3746</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;m having a little trouble. I have finally gotten paint(g) to work, and I have a little game going. But I want to have a button along with the box moving around reacting to the keys. But when I try to do this, the KeyListener apparently stops working and the ActionListener starts working. Do I have to call requestKeyFocus() or whatever whenever the person clicks the grid or what? Help appreciated.

Oh and I&#39;ve attached my code below.</description>

              <p>Nice tougher problem <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Before I get to the solution, a couple of pointers…you don’t need so many ‘this’ calls.  You’re extending the JFrame class, and therefore all the methods are automatically a part of ‘this’ object.  It makes no difference really, but its just code aesthetics.</p>
<p>Second, the show() method is deprecated and replaced by setVisible (thats why you’re getting the deprecation warnings).  I would recommend you either just use the default setVisible() and call the pack() method in the constructor, or use this method instead:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    public void setVisible(boolean b) {
        pack();
        super.setVisible(b);
    }</code></pre>
<p>Now for the problem - the button hogs the focus in the application.  So what you need to so is allow your GameComponent object to be focusable and then call focus to it.  First, change this.addKeyListener(this) to gc.addKeyListener(this) as you want your GameComponent to use the keyboard listener (the JFrame isn’t technically focused).  Then stick this code after you add gc to the content pane:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        gc.setFocusable(true);
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(
            new Runnable() {
                public void run() {
                    gc.requestFocus();
                }
            }
        );</code></pre>
<p>Basically all that does is allow the GameComponent to be focusable (which a component is not by default) and then just requests focus when swing allows it.</p>
<p>Also, I would recommend you stick a enter.setFocusable(false) in there as well, so that if the user click the enter button the focus won’t stay on the button.</p>
<p>Hope that helps <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
