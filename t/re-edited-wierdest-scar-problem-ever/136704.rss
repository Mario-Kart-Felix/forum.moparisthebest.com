    <description>ok i got a few wc scripts that might actaully work for me. When they compile and run it logs in but doesnt do anything. after it logs in it takes like 10 min or more for the script to run after it logs me in or not at all. Could someone help me with this problem? :confused:

 EDIT = ok i found out it stops working after it logs in and the status bar of scar stay at logging in player and takes a long time to get past that or wont even work at all.</description>
