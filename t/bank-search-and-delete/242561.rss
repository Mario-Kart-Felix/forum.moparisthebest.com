    <title>Bank search and delete?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bank-search-and-delete/242561</link>
    <description>OK so what I would like is maybe some sort of script, that will search every single character file, and if it finds a certain item in there bank.

Example: character-bank = 1	4362	4

It deletes it, I was thinking maybe VB/JScript or maybe some sort of Java code such as check dupe which when they login if the item is found it deletes it.

Any help would be great, have checked out Telenubby script but don&#39;t feel like running it to check every single line of the &quot;character-bank =&quot; to see if they have the item.</description>
