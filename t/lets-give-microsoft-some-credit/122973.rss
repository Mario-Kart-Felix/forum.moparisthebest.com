    <title>Lets Give Microsoft Some Credit</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lets-give-microsoft-some-credit/122973</link>
    <description>I read something and it sparked me to post this.

Really the only reason other operating systems are safter than window operating systems is because usually people that start using computer start with windows just liek almost every single user in this forum did. Which means you have total idiots downloading anything and everything. Which means virus makers will be making all the viruses they want and all these idiots will be downloading them and didtrubuting them without even knowing. Thats really the reason why windows is not safe. On the other hand nobody starts out with linux, so now virus makers would make a virus for linux because everybody that has linux is smart enough to scan before using.

Safeness:
Microsoft &lt; Linux
User friendly:
Microsoft &gt; Linux</description>

Or it could have something to do with the large amount of users of the Windows operating system, which makes it the most practical choice for exploits and malware.</p>
<p>But, you never know.<br>

<p>Of course that contributes to it, but the point still stands that the malware shouldn’t be able to do what it does in the first place.[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree, I don’t think market share contributes <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> much to exploitation. Market share does not mean that more hacks will be available to it. It does contribute to it, like Mopman said, but it’s not the sole reason behind it. It’s probably just 10% of the reason. The main reason is the operating system, how it was designed, and how many holes are in it. If it has a shitty design and filled with holes, then of course it will get hacked and that’s</p>
<p>Take for example, Firefox. It is starting to have a greater market share. It’s at 17% or so in the states and about 27% in Europe. Every time an exploit is found, it’s fixed in a matter of days and thus becoming a better and more stable browser. The more people that use it, since it’s open source, the more people contribute to it and, again, the better and more stable the browser gets.</p>
<p>After switching to Firefox, I can truly say I have no spyware at all running. Ever since I made the switch, and cleaned my computer, the spyware has stayed at 0.</p>
<p>They need to tear down the Windows OS, and just start from scratch. Patching it constantly is just a horrible way to fix the problems. If they start over, with a better and efficiency in mind, they could make an operating system better than Linux. But MS just does not care. Monopolies just stop caring… They will start caring when Linux/Mac take a good chunk out of MS. Can’t wait for that to happen. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Another 10 or so years though…</p>

That's where things go wrong. When a Linux application crashes, all you have to do is hit ctrl + alt + del, which boots X.

              <p>Windows isn’t unstable. It just has a ton of crap that IS unstable linked into the kernel. When that crap crashes, windows crashes with it. It’s because of how windows developement worked: Each new version that had new functionality that required changes to the internal workings of the system broke programs that were using said workings instead of the API because doing so was faster. So, appcompat was born. It detects these programs by name and then hacks everything around it so that it works the same way it did on the previous release of windows that this program works on. And a whole lot of those hacks are for various device drivers, which of course live in kernel space. When one of those drivers changes and the hacks no longer work correctly, boom.</p>

<p>No.<br>
Wndows is for n00bs.<br>
Windows in unreliable.<br>
Linux it impossible or very hard to get viruses.<br>
Linux is open source.<br>
Linux, yes it slightly harder to use.<br>
Linux is free.</p>
<p>In spite of all this. Yes i am a windows user. Simply because my comps crap and has no space to install linux lol (i have 38 GB of stuff. The comp takes like 40GB).</p>
<p>Do i give credit to microsoft? Course i do. Its a good system and they are an extremely powerful company.</p>
<p>But look at the 360. How unreliable that is. Microsoft have had to expand all warranties to 3 years from the usually 6 months. They are offering all free repairs and shipping and are having to spend over 1.7 BILLION on repairs. You may say, ‘that’s because they are nice and are giving free repairs’. No its because if they piss of their customers enough with making them pay more. They will take their system back and get a ps3 of wii.</p>
<p>33% of all 360’s have broken. 3-4% have had one break twice. Don’t believe me? Look on gamespot.</p>
