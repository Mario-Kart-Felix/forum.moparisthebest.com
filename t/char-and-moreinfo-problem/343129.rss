    <title>Char and Moreinfo problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/char-and-moreinfo-problem/343129</link>
    <description>Has anyone taken the moreinfo and character folders and successfully merged them? If so, could you please explain how. I&#39;ve spent a ton of time messing with the save and loadgame methods and I&#39;ve made no progress. Even though what I did seemed like it would work, it still doesn&#39;t save the features such as hair color and beard.</description>
