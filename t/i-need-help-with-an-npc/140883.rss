              <p>To place an npc follow below:</p>
<p>-Go to autospawn.cfg after you have got the ID number for the npc you want<br>
-You will see the coords copied and pasted 3 times.<br>
-It will say the npc ID and change that after you copied and pasted another npc.<br>
-Find the case where the npc talk in npchandler.java and changewhat it says<br>
(add the ID above)<br>
A bit obvious. And most people probs knows what ur talking about. You already<br>
posted half of what you wanted with the choords in the speech above? So I dont know<br>
why you posted that.</p>
