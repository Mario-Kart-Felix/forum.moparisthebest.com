    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-z508/318050</link>
    <description>i just downloaded z 508 and im planing on hosting it. I just need help with the ::pvp command i want it so you don&#39;t have to do it, and its all pvp. and yes ive changed the coords and put the coords that the command gives and changed it to the coords that a person arrives at when they first create there account but after you logg out the first time and logg back in its not pvp but normal then u have to do ::pvp again. I want to make it so everytime you logg in its like the pvp command is already done.</description>
