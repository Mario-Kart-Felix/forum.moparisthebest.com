              <blockquote>1. Confirm Both the Torrent and the Movie Release Date</blockquote>
Means nothing if know where to look. I have gotten 2 movies before the release date. Theater's get watermarked copies to watch. If an employee is sneaky enough to get it home, he can get a copy of it.
<blockquote>9. Trackers that Can't Be Found on Google</blockquote>
You can remove these from each download via properties. (In UTorrent)
<blockquote>10. Only Use the Following Media Players</blockquote>
All media players are at risk actually. The problem is not the media player itself, its that people download it from bad locations. I suggest, download it from the creator, if possible. Sometimes, like i have seen Microsoft do, they will put it on downloads.com or some other file-hosting website.
<p>Just watch what your doing, that is all common sense. Also, a tip, have a anti-virus that keeps an eye on new files as well. EX: AVG Free. I know its not the best, but it does check all downloaded files.</p>
