    <description>Hey.

I&#39;m not really sure how to explain this, but..

I&#39;m using a &quot;cheezscape&quot; source to practice my first server, but when I try to logon to local host, (through moparscape,) my account is just nulled. When I check my servers logs, it says my character is already logged in. I&#39;ve tried this with different account, each with different privileges.

I bet This is no help at all, I&#39;ve never been good at explaining things. Thanks for reading this, however.</description>
