    <description>Hello, so i have done a basic private server yearssss ago and have lost the touch i guess.. I am looking for some help I guess im going to try to make a successful private server but no clue where to start on the JDK (i have 1.6.0_24 and 1.6.0_02) also the source i have Pimpscape but every time i go to compile it gives me the following







:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::
:: ::
:: Please wait while Afterlife&#39;s Server is Compiled.. ::
:: ::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::

Note: stream.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.








:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::
:: ::
:: Afterlife&#39;s Server has been compiled successfully! ::
:: ::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::

Press any key to continue . . .

Any ideas on why? I am willing to change anything and everything or even if i could get a team going on a private server of people who know more than me would be great and could even possibly go for a 614+ client. I would also love to get a custom client going but i know that wont happen and that is fine with me. Not trying to get &quot;gimme gimme&quot; &quot;free server made&quot; or anything like that just looking for help and tips. Thank you to all!</description>
