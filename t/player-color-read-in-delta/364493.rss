    <description>so when you scroll over anything, a furnace, a person, etc, you see the typing in the top left corner. so let&#39;s say you&#39;re cb 120 and you scroll over a 126, the name and cb lvl would be in a reddish color, and if they were cb lvl 80 then it would be green like good grass :p. how could i change the colors for these scroll overs of people? i dont know how to post pictures so this was as good as i could explain it. thanks in advance.</description>
