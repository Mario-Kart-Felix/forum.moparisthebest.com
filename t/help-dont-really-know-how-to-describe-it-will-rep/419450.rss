    <description>Okay so I&#39;m trying to make this door open but when I compile it says &quot;Duplicate case label&quot; and yes I know what it means. But how would I make it so I can use that door also though. Their both the same object but in different places. I didn&#39;t originally place them there, they are Yanille Doors. ID= 1533 Thanks guys!</description>

              <p>To have it open properly, you would have to edit doors.cfg not ActionHandler.class.  But if you still want to use ActionHandler, add a check for the position.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">case ObjectId:
if(obX == c.absX + 1 &amp;&amp; obY == c.absY + 1) {
}
break;</code></pre>

              <p>Wasn’t able to find the method for entering and leaving with the same object, but perhaps go to the extreme and add a right click  ‘enter’ and ‘leave’ option via Objectdef.class   &lt;- think that’s correct.</p>
<p><code>if (i == objectID) {
objectDef.name = "ObjectName";
}</code></p>
<p>Although that seems like alot to go through for just a door, if all else fails I’d just add a portal on the other side of the door.</p>
