    <title>[PI] Models and claws inf spec?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-models-and-claws-inf-spec/354258</link>
    <description>Okay so The base here is project insanity

I can see that there are the inits for chaotic weapons added.

I check the raw folder which has the models and i see them there.

When i saw the item ingame it comes up as dwarf remains. In the shop i value it and it says the name of it and how much

So i think this is a problem with the models, when i try to add them ingame it says cannot find model #

So whats wrong with the models???





Also d claws have infinite spec so how do i fix that</description>
