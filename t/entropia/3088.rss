    <description>Entropia is an mmorpg, but not just your average mmo.

Rather then use virtual money, it uses 100% real money.

Not exactly the most pretty looking game, but if your really good at it you can make a lot of money. basically you attach your CC to your character, and you pay real money for all the items you buy and stuff like that. if you want you can play for free, but it&#39;s pretty pointless, as the only way to make money is to spend money. There is one guy in that game that has made a total of 1 million dollars from playing this game, and I&#39;ve heard of another person who bought some in-game property for 27 thousand dollars, and hes made it back already, and will now start making real money. 

I havn&#39;t tried it yet, but I&#39;ve read a lot about it, and it keeps getting mentioned on many forums I hang around.

Don&#39;t forget that the creators have made it so that in the end your going to lose money. They dont want you to make money, so just dont go spedning 100 dollars thinking you can make it back because that would be very hard to do.
