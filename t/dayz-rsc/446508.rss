    <title>DayZ RSC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dayz-rsc/446508</link>
    <description>anyone played the Arma II mod, DayZ? pretty cool, basically, you start with a pistol, small amount of ammo, some baked beans and water, and a bandage.

your alone in a 300km sq map, with zombies everywhere (and players), you need to find a hatchet to get wood to create a fire, when you kill a zombie it may drop a few bullets, usually nothing. can find different guns around and their ammo, if you get hit by a zombie you start to bleed, and will eventually die unless you use a bandage on your self. basically, real life survival logic

incorporating this into RSC would be interesting.

everyone is level 1, with 100hp, you can&#39;t gain levels, it turns the entire game into a gear based game.
zombies everywhere around the whole F2P rsc map, theres gear around however even wearing full rune does not mean you can smash everything.
the whole game turns into survival, AND it&#39;s full pvp. 

now a big part of DayZ is moving around without zombies noticing you, you might crouch/walk instead of run so they don&#39;t hear you etc. i&#39;m unsure right now on how i would make zombies in RSC attack you, maybe moving too close, or walking around too much, idk.

what you guys think, cool idea? fishing, mining etc may still be there, however there will be NO levels, and ores will spawn ONCE in random places, you cant just chill at a mining spot, the more dangerous the area the better objects are around that area.

so if you was going to karamja to fish some stuff, 1 fish pond may spawn every 2-3 minutes and may only give a couple of fish, as well as the chance of zombies hanging around the jetty may happen.

you can also get food from killing rabbits or rats that may be wandering around etc.

oh and when you die, you lose EVERYTHING (someone else nearby could loot it)
you will spawn somewhere randomly on the map

there is &#39;banks&#39; however you need to make one (craft a stash or something) and plant it somewhere, it will stay there and you can deposit items, only you will be able to access those items BUT other people can view whats in your stash)

IDK but plenty of suggestions may make this really fun and interesting.</description>

              <p>I saw the Reddit posting about it and have been trying to get it installed in my free time. Played a little ARMA2 but the controls were a bit more complex than I was used to with Battlefield 3. Looks like a fun alternative though, similar to that plague update that was partially made for RSCA.</p>

Also taking out most the rsc hud would make the game better, like taking the map,compass,friends list.<br>
I’d dig it.<br>
Btw I have the DayZ mod, pm if you want to play together sometime.</p>
