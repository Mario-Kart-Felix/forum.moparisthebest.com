    <title>A couple of things on this server i made</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-couple-of-things-on-this-server-i-made/296157</link>
    <description>ok listen all people i have told jagex about this company and they are going to shut it down and screw all server ips i give ok so beware this forum will be shutdown for reasons!

On the other hand rune-server has already been accepted by jagex due to it being paid for and most people go on their forums! 



Just a list of servers been shutdown:

Darkheavenpkz (2007-2009) (Friends Only Server)

icepkscape (2009-2009) shutdown for good

So if you want more info on this pm me and not get yourself done


and moparscape will be fined alot if they dont take it down</description>
