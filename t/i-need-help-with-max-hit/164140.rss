              <p>There are 4 boxes on runescape, <em>Attack Styles</em> The First being attack and last one being defence hit the hardest, While the other 2 in the middle hit really soft.</p>
<p>To be able to change this, search this in client.java</p>
<p>The Method:</p>
<p>CalculateMaxHit() {</p>
<p>As you can see thats why it hits hard:</p>
<p>if (FightType == 1 || FightType == 4) { //Accurate &amp; Defensive</p>
<p>I think the closer it is to 1 it hits harder, i could be wrong though, because i don’t remember at the moment.</p>
