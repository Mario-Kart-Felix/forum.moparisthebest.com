    <title>Odd Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/odd-problem/6431</link>
    <description>I feel like a noob asking this but oh well.

I&#39;m trying to use a powerminer. Well any of 3 powerminers actually. I&#39;ve got Stupid3ooo&#39;s, Solemn Wishes&#39;, and RealRune&#39;s.
On all three of them whenever I run the script it will either:
A. Not find the color even though I&#39;m standing right next to the rock. (I&#39;ve tried different places, ores, etc.)
B. Find the colors and click but after it clicks I lag to hell and logout.
C. Find the colors and randomly walk towards the Bottom Right of my screen.

I have set the colors manually and that eliminates problem A but still get problem B or C.

I&#39;ve searched around and a few people seem to be having the same problem. 
But no one seems to have found and answer on what is causing it.

And yes, I do have the Client targetted, I have tried both SwiftSwitch and RS webpage to make it work, I have it on v-bright and 32bit color as the script reccomends.</description>

              <p>I don’t see how 3 seperate scripts could all be causing the same problems but I guess that is a possibility because I earlier used an autofighter and it worked perfectly.</p>
<p>Other people seem to have the scripts working fine for them. So I’m really confuzzled right now.</p>
