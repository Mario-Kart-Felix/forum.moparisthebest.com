    <title>Allow use of a item after &#39;X&#39; Amount of In-game time? Help!?!?!?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/allow-use-of-a-item-after-x-amount-of-in-game-time-help/481021</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve worked on adding a ingame time counter, really easy. blah blah blah. 
I&#39;ve also added a Veteran cape, seeing how my server goes on tomorrow. I&#39;m giving it all players that helped before it goes online. After this, is there a way i can give it to everyone who has played say a hundred or so hours? Thanks.</description>

              <p>Well You can do something like this :</p>
<p><code>
if(System.currentTimeMillis() &lt; 360000000){ //The 360000000 its 100 hours
	addItem(Itemid of the veteran cape.,amount);
}</code><br>
Again maybe it’s not hole of the code but I think it’s a start.</p>
