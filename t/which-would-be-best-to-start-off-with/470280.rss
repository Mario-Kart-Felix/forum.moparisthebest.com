    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-would-be-best-to-start-off-with/470280</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking to restart up my servers but I wanna change the source type.


I figured it would be pointless for the newer server revisions and wanted to stay in the 317s to Delta, to 508&#39;s and possibly 530&#39;s.


So my question is really cuz im more interested in teh 530&#39;s,


Which would be a great base to start from. One preferably with all skills working and loose items except 3 on death and what not cuz i wanna base it economy based, and i think not loosing items on death is pointless.</description>

              <p>This is another example of why I don’t answer people who ask for help very often. Instead of asking for a source with loads of requirements to fit your needs, you should create the requirements in the source to make that fit your needs. That’s why I gave you the really big index, that’s why he told you to do that. If you’re not bothering to put some effort into it then there’s no point in hosting a server.</p>

<p>I’ve ran a server for a While, However i feel like i would save time coding around the content “I WANT TO ADD” and stuff I make up, on a source where I don’t have to worry about 90% of it not even working, Thats why i asked what is best to start off with. I dont need guides on how to java code or any of that. Please stick to the question and not send me information that has nothing to do with what im asking for.</p>
