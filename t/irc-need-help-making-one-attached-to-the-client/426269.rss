    <title>IRC - Need help making one (attached to the client)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/irc-need-help-making-one-attached-to-the-client/426269</link>
    <description>Alright, well I would like someone to HELP me make an internet relay chat attached to my client kind of like the MSCP client (but that only prints client stuff) except it being an IRC chat for my players to chat and talk, etc.

I have no experience in making a chat like this that would be online for everyone to see, thank&#39;s in advance.</description>
