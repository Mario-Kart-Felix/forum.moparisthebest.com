    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/definitely-need-some-help-with-moparscape-3-0/5406</link>
    <description>*NOTE*
On the pics, for some reason they&#39;re really small, but if you save em, you can open it in Windows Picture Viewer, makes it A LOT bigger. :D

Hey people, im new here, heard about moparscape from a friend, so thought id try it out. ;)

problem is, everytime i try to run &quot;runMoparScape&quot; (the ms-dos batch file), it gives me this screen:

[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v408/snowfox10/mparagh.jpg[/img]

heres a link since the pic is small: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v408/snowfox10/mparagh.jpg

any ideas? ive tried using MoparScapePriv21, more errors than trying to use 3.0

~SOLVED, THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO HELPED WITH THE CLIENT ERROR, YET I STILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE CACHE, TALKED ABOUT BELOW~

Thanks :D
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ok, as i said, im gonna update this, so i did. i got the new java, and got moparscape 3.0 to work, right now its downloading the cache, then im gonna try and find my way through connecting to a certain server ;)

thanks for the move kbm, kinda thought it should be here :D

!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!!!!

right now im having a problem with the cache, it doesnt want to be opened:

its having a problem unzipping the cache after it is downloaded, which i think is why its not able to connect to the servers

what happens is that when i try to connect to &quot;runeq.no-ip.org&quot; it says &quot;Connection Error&quot;, and also, at the bottom, where theres a log of stuff thats goin on, it says:

[07:03:00] Downloading file...
[07:46:25] File downloaded...
[07:46:27] deleted c:/windows/.mpr_file_store_32/cache.zip
[07:56:10] Set world to: runeq.no-ip.org

so because it cant unzip the cache file that is automatically downloaded, it deletes it

anyways, i need help on finding out how to get the zip file to be unzipped properly, which i think would solve the whole &quot;Connection Error&quot; thing. thanks ;)</description>
