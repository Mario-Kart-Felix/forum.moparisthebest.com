    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-fix-client-crashes-in-64-bit/333559</link>
    <description>Hello, recently i was having trouble with my client however i fixed it!

do you have this problem ??

My client code
------------------
@echo off
Start javaw -Xmx500m -cp .;Theme.jar Gui
exit
-----------------------------------
where ever it says the second line, delete the start javaw and put &quot;C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/Jre6/bin/java.exe&quot; make sure the brackets are there!

have a nice day! :)
