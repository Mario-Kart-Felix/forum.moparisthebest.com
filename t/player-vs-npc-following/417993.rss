    <title>PLAYER VS NPC Following!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-vs-npc-following/417993</link>
    <description>Hello, I need some help with the &quot;Player VS NPC&quot;. I don&#39;t care that NPC&#39;s can walk through walls, I just want to make it so when I click &quot;Attack&quot; monster. I want my player to walk around objects, and walls.

I am working on a new dungeoneering, and this will be really useful for keeping players inside the walls, instead of out side the walls. 

I have another server that this works on, but I can&#39;t find where the code source is. If you have an Idea of where, please let me know. So I can share it, and be resourceful.

At the moment I&#39;m looking at, PlayerAssisstant.java, and NPCHandler.java. 

- Thanks!</description>
