    <description>How is this community over 80x smarter than the Jagex programmers?

If you think about it, we remake everything they make from scratch, how is that?</description>

You are becoming stupider by the post, stop well you are ahea… too late.</p>
<p>There is nowhere near 300,000 active user’s on this site, there never has been. There are also not 300,000 people on here that would be willing to play a private server.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the server that you plan on making will hold 300,000 people on only 3 different server’s? That is roughly 100,000 people per world (VPS). Runescape holds 2,000 per world, so the server we are making is infact 50x more stable then Runescape?</p>
<p>Please inform me, no all of us, on how you plan to accomplish such a task.</p>
<p>Edit: edited the stability part<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I was not inferring to the active users.</p>
<p>And you got me again, but as the server grew we could allow more players on as we got VPS/Dedi upgrades from donations, etc.[/quote]<br>
I think you mean “referring”<br>
Also, I can tell you now [as many others have] that this will fail. And if it doesn’t fail, you’ll get sued most likely.</p>

<p>Jagex has been running Runescape for what, 10 years now? So it has taken them almost 10 year’s to get from where they started to where they are now. They probably have around (not sure) 50-100 developers who work 8 hour day’s, 5 day’s a week.</p>

<p>Rsc was made by 3 people. Rs2 was made by 50. Today, There is about 130 working the job, 200 on mechscape, and the others on funorb. The rest, player support and the guy who buys the pizza and coffee.</p>

I seriously doubt you’d even find 10 people out of all those that are here for ‘educational purposes’, who would be interested in accurately recreating runescape. If you want runescape, go play runescape.</p>
<p>As for the manhours that went into making the game, it’s a bit of a joke now that they are switching to platform dependant graphics, the download is near 100k and there’s little gameplay. There are alot of better games out there written in C(++) with better graphics, similar download and far better gameplay.</p>
<p>Still you have to thank them for sharing all their client code. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>There is nowhere near 300,000 active user’s on this site, there never has been. There are also not 300,000 people on here that would be willing to play a private server.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the server that you plan on making will hold 300,000 people on only 3 different server’s? That is roughly 100,000 people per world (VPS). Runescape holds 2,000 per world, so the server we are making is infact 50x more stable then Runescape?</p>
<p>Please inform me, no all of us, on how you plan to accomplish such a task.</p>
<p>Edit: edited the stability part[/quote]</p>
<p>I was not inferring to the active users.</p>
<p>And you got me again, but as the server grew we could allow more players on as we got VPS/Dedi upgrades from donations, etc.</p>

<p>Jagex has been running Runescape for what, 10 years now? So it has taken them almost 10 year’s to get from where they started to where they are now. They probably have around (not sure) 50-100 developers who work 8 hour day’s, 5 day’s a week.</p>
<p>So what you want to do is re-create a game that took that much manpower and that much time with a bunch of teenager’s from a Runescape cheating site without paying them or even motivating them for that matter.</p>
<p>Good fuckin’ luck</p>
<p>In hindsight of this post I see that I rambled quite a bit, I do that from time to time, but what I was trying to say was this; A game like Runescape, almost any game for that matter, takes time to develop, it take’s constant updating, constant testing, you would have to be in contact with your team members 24/7 to make sure they are working towards the right goals, along with 9999 other factor’s that have not been mentioned.</p>
