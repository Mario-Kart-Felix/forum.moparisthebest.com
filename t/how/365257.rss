    <title>How?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how/365257</link>
    <description>So, if I host a server, how the hell would I try to gain players? The MoparScape Server Status page is no choice, since there are eight sponsored servers that receive all the traffic and other server status pages aren&#39;t effective.

Domain is $10 a year, the hosting is not too expensive either. What ‘information’? And how does the webclient cost money?</p>

<p>The ads cover the hosting, I pay about $350/month for this particular dedicated, and I own 4 domains we actively use, and 5 or 6 stellar-dawn related domains.  Plus alternate DNS hosting, hosting for the client and cache, various stuff.

Most other sites I know detect that and force you to disable it, or bug you, I don’t.</p>
<p>The sponsored server money I have been saving up, I haven’t actually bought anything yet because no one has submitted a server at all.  Blakeman talked to me thoroughly about it, and potentially has an eligible server, but isn’t willing to sell until he tries hosting it.  I also am trying to buy clients, but no one has seemed interesting in that either yet.  Perhaps a tutorial or something needs made.  I’m also considering offering some of the money for an updater so I can finish my bot.  But it will all be used for the community in one way or the other, if you have a suggestion, I’m always open to them.[/quote]But as it was stated, doesn’t the current income from the Status Page cover any hosting cost you may have (and more)? I think a lot of people would appreciate those ads being gone. I think a few thousand dollars in the coffers might be enough savings to buy a server/client/update server.</p>

<p>I do agree that servers should definitely get more players based on the quality rather than the amount of money the owner has.</p>

<p>Either way, it doesn’t total up to the thousands he is bringing in, not including the ads. I don’t mind too much about the money, I just would like to know what he’s spending it on for the community.</p>

              <p>^ I am quite curious about that myself. We all know about how you will potentially buy a good server, but as that has yet to happen, I’m curious. I think I said it before, but now with the few thousand coming in each month, why do we need the ads at the top and bottom of the page, that take people AWAY from the site? I happen to know that you receive a check each month for that, but does that go into the community fund?</p>
