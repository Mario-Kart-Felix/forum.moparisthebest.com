    <title>Google AdSense Account Disabled</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/google-adsense-account-disabled/349032</link>
    <description>Hello. A few players on my server kept mass clicking my Ads to &quot;help out&quot;. They made me lose ALL of the 150.00 that was on there and the other money that they earned. Did anyone here experience the same, as my players are telling me that there are a bunch of glitches with google at the moment? Anyone know, as I don&#39;t have much money to keep my server on longer then 3-4 months, without donations.</description>
