    <title>Duping, in rs2 ? O.o</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/duping-in-rs2-o-o/198319</link>
    <description>Ok, I was browsing the Runescape forums and found stumbled across this.

* attached at bottom *

Now, would that possibly cause dupes ?

Say someone traded a Yellow Party Hat for 200m
The player who received the party hat then logs out before the Disconnect.
Then, the player who received the 200m gets disconnected, and receives the party hat again ?

I&#39;m not sure, JaGex are smarter than that. But yeah...

              <p>[quote=“bakatool, post:22, topic:198319”]<span class="bbcode-b">FACT about DUPING</span></p>
<p>only way to dupe in rs2 would be to mess with their sql packet processing if you create a big enough queue of sql queries on the server longer then it would take to process lets say you logging in and out then you could dupe this is called a universal dupe works on mostly ALL MMORPG’s due to the fact that MMORPG’s nowday run 3 servers<br>
database server, login server, and a bunch of game servers.</p>
<p>If the database server gets enough stress that it self atleast 20 seconds to process it all thats about 30,000 queries +++</p>
<p>then after you logout and login you could give your item to your friend relog again you will see that you still have the item in your inventory after relogging thats because your data wasn’t really saved but not you FOOLED with the game server’s memory server side yes… you created a item fooling the game server into thinking the player you loaded already has the items which he does do the SQL not updating your information fast enough.</p>
<p>The way this bug worked in many mmorpgs i’ve played people usually after cracking the crypt that makes packets find one packet they could spam to server without corrupting the protocol of packets so you don’t get a expell or disconnect right away. They would usally spam a packet that has connection to SQL but overlooked by the creators of the game mostly like a… guild system/ squadron system. Doing a packet event in order extremely fast around 900~1000 packets per second  leaving/making a guild system created alot of stress.</p>
<p>Anyways this dupe worked on Diablo, Helbreath, Lineage, Legend Of Mir, MUOnline World of Warcraft all very popular game and yet all had a similar bug.</p>
<p>Runescape only uses SQL on login/logout so its extremely rare that you will get anywhere so just words of wisdom dupes are not as hard as you may think.</p>
<p>As for gold duplication thats also something thats somewhat universal but even more rare to find then database server stress. I ain’t gonna say much about this one cause I have my reasons all I can say as advise, the games client is dumber then the server it self and studing the packet the client sends is the key to doing anything use your minds and send something the client can’t possibly send on its own.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is all complete bullshit, thanks for playing.</p>

<p>No. That means you are reset to a previous date. Just like moparscape stores character files, they store 10-20 minute, and even day backups of your character. They just roll back to that.

<p>only way to dupe in rs2 would be to mess with their sql packet processing if you create a big enough queue of sql queries on the server longer then it would take to process lets say you logging in and out then you could dupe this is called a universal dupe works on mostly ALL MMORPG’s due to the fact that MMORPG’s nowday run 3 servers<br>
database server, login server, and a bunch of game servers.</p>
<p>If the database server gets enough stress that it self atleast 20 seconds to process it all thats about 30,000 queries +++</p>
<p>then after you logout and login you could give your item to your friend relog again you will see that you still have the item in your inventory after relogging thats because your data wasn’t really saved but not you FOOLED with the game server’s memory server side yes… you created a item fooling the game server into thinking the player you loaded already has the items which he does do the SQL not updating your information fast enough.</p>
<p>The way this bug worked in many mmorpgs i’ve played people usually after cracking the crypt that makes packets find one packet they could spam to server without corrupting the protocol of packets so you don’t get a expell or disconnect right away. They would usally spam a packet that has connection to SQL but overlooked by the creators of the game mostly like a… guild system/ squadron system. Doing a packet event in order extremely fast around 900~1000 packets per second  leaving/making a guild system created alot of stress.</p>
<p>Anyways this dupe worked on Diablo, Helbreath, Lineage, Legend Of Mir, MUOnline World of Warcraft all very popular game and yet all had a similar bug.</p>
<p>Runescape only uses SQL on login/logout so its extremely rare that you will get anywhere so just words of wisdom dupes are not as hard as you may think.</p>
<p>As for gold duplication thats also something thats somewhat universal but even more rare to find then database server stress. I ain’t gonna say much about this one cause I have my reasons all I can say as advise, the games client is dumber then the server it self and studing the packet the client sends is the key to doing anything use your minds and send something the client can’t possibly send on its own.[/quote]</p>
<p>Other than the fact that you have no clue what you’re talking about, well, at least it sounds somewhat convincing.</p>
