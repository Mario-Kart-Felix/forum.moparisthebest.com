    <title>Weirdest Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weirdest-problem/479912</link>
    <description>Okay so I have my server and client and it is online, but my server is only getting like 2 or 3 players online ever. Now I know what you are thinking, but my server has over 102 downloads and I was just like wtf?! how is this happening. so I went to my friends house and tried to login from his comp. and it kept getting an error saying

&quot;error connecting to server&quot; or &quot;No response from server&quot;

How could is get no response when the account isn&#39;t even created yet? SO the weird question is, why can some players connect but most other players cannot? and is there any possible chance to fix this. I am willing to pay $$$ for to who ever can fully 100% fix this problem!</description>
