&lt;blockquote&gt;Kenyan Monkeys Make Lewd Gestures at Women

Kenyan officials are not sure how to handle a troop of rude monkeys that&#39;s been making lewd gestures at women, London&#39;s Daily Telegraph reports.

&quot;Can the [tourism] minister deploy game rangers ... to deal with the monkey menace?&quot; pleaded local representative Paul Muite in Kenya&#39;s national parliament last month, to accompanying laughter. &quot;These creatures have clearly shown that they have no respect for women.&quot;

Gichuki Kabukuru of the Kenya Wildlife Service told the Telegraph that monkeys and baboons commonly harass women, gesturing at them and touching their own private parts.

&quot;Even in our camps,&quot; he explained, &quot;when men are out on patrol and the monkeys see women and children, they will become very naughty and make lewd signs at them.&quot;

Residents of the Kabete region south of the capital, Nairobi, say women harvesting crops have taken to dressing as men to avoid being bothered by the perverted primates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
