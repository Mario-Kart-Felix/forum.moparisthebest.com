    <description>I got a router, is it possible to portforward through uTorrent? And another question. Will it slow down ur pc. And the last question, isn&#39;t it so that if u download uTorrent, everyone can download things from you, or do u need to do something for that first?</description>

It will not slow down your PC. It just opens a port, thats it.<br>
