              <p>I’ll shed some light into this situation, Even though it is in the wrong section.<br>
You will need to download the Models From the model section of this forum.<br>
You will need to make the client reconise that you are adding models to it, there might be tutorials on this - I would recomend downloading a client that already has models in it, Then making it work for your server.<br>
Just add the models into the model folder, Then go into class8.java and add the ints for the custom item, compile and run.</p>
