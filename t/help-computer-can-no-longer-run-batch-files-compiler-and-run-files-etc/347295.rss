    <title>Help! Computer can no longer run batch files! (compiler and run files etc.)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-computer-can-no-longer-run-batch-files-compiler-and-run-files-etc/347295</link>
    <description>Well, I decided to add shops to my server, so I followed a tutorial, saved the client.java, compiled my server and got 100 errors. I thought it was pretty weird since I didn&#39;t see anything wrong with what I coded on the client.java, so after a lot of working out, I restarted my computer. Now that I have restarted my computer, I make an attempt to compile it again, nothing pops up, my cursor just loads and the computer freezes for what, 10 seconds and runs very slowly since trying to open that batch file so I have to force a shutdown to restart it. This happens to ALL batch files now and I tried running the computer in safe mode, and I could open batch files. I tried a system restore, but finished with an error. Please does anyone have any idea how I could fix this problem? 

Much appreciated, thanks.</description>
