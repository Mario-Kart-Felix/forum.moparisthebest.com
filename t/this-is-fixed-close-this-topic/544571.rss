    <description>Hey guys , yesterday ive been playing an RSPS but i wanted to play another RSPS so ive been searching.
then i came at one rsps , but it said i had to download the new version of Java , so i did that and deleted the old Java version.
Then i tried to play the RSPS and it didnt work , then i wanted to play the one RSPS that i was already been playing , but then this error came.
