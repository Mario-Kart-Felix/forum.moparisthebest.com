RuneWars is a new server opened in February 2013. Unlike other RPG servers our friendly team of staff are dedicated in bringing you the best possible experience. With many quest and more to come, a team of both friendly and fun staff, Multiple Castes (Classes), and much much more.

At RuneWars we use a large range of plugins to increase the RPG and Minecraft server experience, whilst not detracting from survival. We believe the best server is one that has great RPG, PVP and survival.

With over 30 plugins we ensure you get the most of your playtime experience. Examples of our wide range of plugins include; Multiverse, Mcmmo, ecoCreature, BattleArena, Citizens and many more!

On RuneWars we have a special ranking system which we call the Caste System. The Caste System is very close to that many servers offer but differs in several ways. Think of a Caste as a clan or a team. As you progress through the RuneWars server you will encounter Quests offered by NPCs.

To join a Caste you must initiate the first Quest from the Caste that you are interested in, You will find the three major Castes initiation Quests close to spawn. Once you complete the initiation Quest you are now officially part of that Caste and receive the lowest rank and perks for that Caste.

Being in a Caste has benefits which includes perks, skills and being part of a community. Every Caste has ranks, to progress through the ranks you must complete Quest chains for your Caste and defeat members from other Castes. When you achieve a higher Caste rank you will receive more perks and abilities whilst keeping all the lower tiers perks.

Each Caste has a chat channel which only members of that Caste can see and chat in. This is useful since you are able to and encouraged to attack members of other Castes.
