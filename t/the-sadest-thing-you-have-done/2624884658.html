        <p>[quote=“cooper, post:20, topic:262488”]This morning around 3:30 AM, I found two high pitched young children online playing Battlefield: Bad Company on the unranked servers. I was taking a break from ranked and saw that they had climbed up to the top of the crane to snipe on Ghost Town, and were in my squad. Unable to resist my destructive urges, I spawned next to them and threw down two C4’s and pushed down the detonator before they could even realize what was going on. In the next two seconds, my room was filled with their shrieks about how “[I’m] SUPPOSED TO KILL THE OTHER GUYS NOT [them] DUDE!!!”. Still screaming, one of them shouted about how he would kill me while the other kept yelling “NO DON’T SHOOT HIM!” I spawned next to them, this time as sniper, and began taunting them with my knife. One of them tried shooting at me [support] without any success, and the other charged me with the knife. I quickly knifed the support and proceeded to shoot the other in the head with my pistol. This process was repeated for several minutes while they screamed and were unable to kill me until I eventually was kicked for TKing. I rejoined, and started actually attacking the enemy, knowing they would want vengeance. I let them kill me a few times, waiting for them to get kicked, but after a few kills they stopped. So I decided to get a few more taunts in by shooting at their feet with my pistol and sniper rifle. Eventually I got the first kicked and the other was confused, until he eventually got kicked.<br>
