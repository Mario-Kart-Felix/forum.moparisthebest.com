    <title>[PI] Server keeps opening and closing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-server-keeps-opening-and-closing/404032</link>
    <description>was following this dungeonering tutorial here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,498306.0.html

I compiled with no errors, went to run my server, and it kept opening and closing. I managed to get a screenshot but couldn&#39;t post it because eventually I had to restart my computer. It mentioned something like cannot find main class server.server or something around there. could anyone tell me what I did wrong?
