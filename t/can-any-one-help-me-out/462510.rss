    <description>um i&#39;d like to ask since i just started a blank client and server
1. how do i get a cache for it?
2. do i just go through of clients and files and pull stuff at of that for my own or is that against the rules...
3. So i have my no-ip address and its connected to my router how do i know if it will work.
4. What are the best recommendations for files and codes (its a 508) 
5. What exactly do i need since i started from scratch i just didnt want just one persons project?
