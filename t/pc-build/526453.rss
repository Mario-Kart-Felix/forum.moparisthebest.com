    <title>PC Build</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pc-build/526453</link>
    <description>So my brother needs a new computer, so I&#39;m going to put one together.
I&#39;m not a noob in this sector, but it&#39;s always good to hear other opinions.
What do you think of the build for it&#39;s budget and What would you recommend changing and why?
We need to stay in the budget of 750-800€, with the eye on being able to run games like fc3 on high graphics.
Ultra isn&#39;t necessary, just enough to actually run newer and close future games.

[b]This is the build: (all prices in euro)[/b]
power supply: [s]ZALMAN ZM360B-APS - 49,96[/s] Corsair Builder Series CX600 - 61,90
graphical card: Palit GeForce GTX 660 OC - 186,29
DVD/BR combo: LG CH10LS28 Super Multi Blue - 63,67
RAM: Kingston HyperX Genesis 2x4GB - 68,90
CPU: [s]Intel Core i5 3470 - 170,90[/s]  Intel Core i5 3570K / 3.4 GHz - 4 Cores 199,90
CPU cooler: Cooler Master Hyper TX 3 Evo - 18,90
Motherboard: ASUS P8Z68-V PRO/GEN3 - 93,95
Case: Corsair Carbide Series 200R - 52,90
---------------------------- = 746,53


edit: I just saw that the other build here on the GQ page has the same case, I guarantee that this is coincidence lol.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Kidpaparoach, post:6, topic:526453”]I’m not a big hardware nerd unfortunately but,<br>
I’d recommend:<br>
Changing the processor out for the 3570k or getting a new 4th gen i5 if your budget can afford it, for gaming make sure it has the letter ‘k’ in it’s model as those ones are better for overclocking. Your processor is good enough but for the price margin your paying extra it’s worth upgrading.<br>
Get the geforce 760 gfx card, it’s in the same region of pricing as the 660 and is the next generation card. It’s not meant for overclocking etc (I believe) but it has some serious power under the hood. I believe the overall performance is something like 10% better or more and I’m p sure it has a lot more vram (?) which is good for multiple monitors etc. And, of course the support will last for longer for a newer card :D.<br>
I’d estimate that these upgrades would add around 100 euro’s onto the price however, the performance increase would vary from 10-25% (estimate 25 but around that mark) which is a very nice performance boost.[/quote]<br>
Idk I haven’t looked but I heard, 770 is oc version if 680 for under 400$<br>
And possibly 760 is oc 660 ti, idk. U can get 670 for 425$ 770 for under 400<br>
760 for 260… Pretty good deal to me<br>
Btw @ op<br>
Euro is abt equal to pds?<br>
Psu I would get silver stone or corsair because I think they are abit more reliable in my opinion however, I guess if ur settled stick with zalman<br>
Get 3570k it outs performs most higher end i7s<br>
It’s not that much more + more oc</p>

Anything corsair will be fine, and for the love of god please get something modular. The TX650M is about 110 euro will be modular, and will be enough power for your current setup.</p>

              <p>So my brother needs a new computer, so I’m going to put one together.<br>
I’m not a noob in this sector, but it’s always good to hear other opinions.<br>
What do you think of the build for it’s budget and What would you recommend changing and why?<br>
We need to stay in the budget of 750-800€, with the eye on being able to run games like fc3 on high graphics.<br>
Ultra isn’t necessary, just enough to actually run newer and close future games.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">This is the build: (all prices in euro)</span><br>
power supply: <span class="bbcode-s">ZALMAN ZM360B-APS - 49,96</span> Corsair Builder Series CX600 - 61,90<br>
graphical card: Palit GeForce GTX 660 OC - 186,29<br>
DVD/BR combo: LG CH10LS28 Super Multi Blue - 63,67<br>

<p>edit: I just saw that the other build here on the GQ page has the same case, I guarantee that this is coincidence lol.</p>
