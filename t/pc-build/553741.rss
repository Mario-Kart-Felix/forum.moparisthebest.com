    <title>Pc Build</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pc-build/553741</link>
    <description>I know I&#39;ve made a fair few pc builds before but that&#39;s because I&#39;m nervous to commit and seem to be waiting to see new products release to make the price of older items cheaper.

Prev: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/4GVvMp

Current: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VGx3xr

I&#39;ve put this together. For a $1000 dollar build do you think this is good for mainly an office/work computer but can also run games such as minecraft/runescape/wow on max graphics with no restrictions?

What can I change to make it better and cheaper.

Basically looks for a super fast/reliable computer. It won&#39;t be overclocked because I don&#39;t want to make it crazy spec just a good gaming/office computer that is future proof for a good 3-4 years.

My max budget will be $1,100.</description>

<p>Overdoing it on the power supply<br>
Overpriced SSD (can get 240 for 85 pretty easily)<br>

What’s a really quality good priced Radeon graphics card that would fit in the budget?</p>
<p>Edit: Updated PSU and SSD check it out here. <a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VGx3xr" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VGx3xr</a></p>

<p>So is it the best it could be for around 1100?</p>
