    <description>Hey what&#39;s going on everyone,

I&#39;m going to try and cut straight to the chase, I need help finding a good, clean source and client to [b]learn[/b] with. I want to learn server and client sided programming because I feel like they do differ a bit.

I used to be a part of this community a while ago and had my own server. It was delta based and from what most people say (or used to say), is that delta based servers were terribly inefficient. I used to sit on this forum and Rune-Server all day long and just leech off of spoon-fed tutorials and from the few months I spent doing that, I actually did learn a few things because of all of the &quot;anti-leech&quot; mechanisms people used to put, lol.

As you would guess, I forgot most of those things as they were spoon-fed to me, but now I&#39;ve taken beginner courses in JAVA, C, and C++ and I have learned quite a few things about programming.

What I am looking for is a [b]clean source and client[/b], but something that also includes useful things like: skilling, barrows, pest control, fight caves. I want to [b]learn[/b], and I feel like skilling might be time-consuming, but easy to put together. minigames and instances seem a bit challenging as I am really unfamiliar with doing anything of this sort.

It wouldn&#39;t make sense for me to start a calculus course without taking algebra first, would it? Which is why I want a clean source with some of the more challenging things already implemented into the server so as I focus on some of the more easy things to program, I will learn how to program more challenging things into the server.

I&#39;ve been looking around and noticed a lot of people are running PI based servers now and I&#39;ve seen many threads saying how those are also somewhat filled with junk, although I&#39;ve seen a few threads that have some very clean and reconstructed PI based sources, but they exclude the useful things I mentioned above.

I&#39;ve searched all over the place and there seems to be only two types of sources available:

A. Completely clean sources that have literally nothing on them but combat.
B. Servers loaded with junk that need to be cleaned by someone with much more expertise than me.

Now, I&#39;m not sure If I&#39;m even taking a step in the right direction by what I&#39;m asking, but all input is appreciated, even if is criticizing me for taking a step in the wrong direction. It will just help guide me better in what I should be trying to do!

Thanks everyone.</description>

              <p>You can’t ask for a clean source and then state you want the clean source to include content, because that completely defeats the “clean” aspect. If you’re after a source that has content, but not coded horrifically, then yes there are sources out there that are pretty good. You can find them in the downloads section.</p>
