        <p>Hey what’s going on everyone,</p>
<p>I’m going to try and cut straight to the chase, I need help finding a good, clean source and client to <span class="bbcode-b">learn</span> with. I want to learn server and client sided programming because I feel like they do differ a bit.</p>
<p>I used to be a part of this community a while ago and had my own server. It was delta based and from what most people say (or used to say), is that delta based servers were terribly inefficient. I used to sit on this forum and Rune-Server all day long and just leech off of spoon-fed tutorials and from the few months I spent doing that, I actually did learn a few things because of all of the “anti-leech” mechanisms people used to put, lol.</p>
<p>As you would guess, I forgot most of those things as they were spoon-fed to me, but now I’ve taken beginner courses in JAVA, C, and C++ and I have learned quite a few things about programming.</p>
<p>What I am looking for is a <span class="bbcode-b">clean source and client</span>, but something that also includes useful things like: skilling, barrows, pest control, fight caves. I want to <span class="bbcode-b">learn</span>, and I feel like skilling might be time-consuming, but easy to put together. minigames and instances seem a bit challenging as I am really unfamiliar with doing anything of this sort.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t make sense for me to start a calculus course without taking algebra first, would it? Which is why I want a clean source with some of the more challenging things already implemented into the server so as I focus on some of the more easy things to program, I will learn how to program more challenging things into the server.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking around and noticed a lot of people are running PI based servers now and I’ve seen many threads saying how those are also somewhat filled with junk, although I’ve seen a few threads that have some very clean and reconstructed PI based sources, but they exclude the useful things I mentioned above.</p>
<p>I’ve searched all over the place and there seems to be only two types of sources available:</p>
<p>A. Completely clean sources that have literally nothing on them but combat.<br>
B. Servers loaded with junk that need to be cleaned by someone with much more expertise than me.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not sure If I’m even taking a step in the right direction by what I’m asking, but all input is appreciated, even if is criticizing me for taking a step in the wrong direction. It will just help guide me better in what I should be trying to do!</p>
<p>Thanks everyone.</p>

        <p>You can’t ask for a clean source and then state you want the clean source to include content, because that completely defeats the “clean” aspect. If you’re after a source that has content, but not coded horrifically, then yes there are sources out there that are pretty good. You can find them in the downloads section.</p>
