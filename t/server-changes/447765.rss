    <title>Server changes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-changes/447765</link>
    <description>We&#39;ve been working on a lot of changes for the server as of late, this has taken quite a while but we got there in the end. Moparcraft has had a lot of map resets, and server reconfigurations such as the temporary deactivation of PVP a short while ago all these changes have been inconsistent and usually didn&#39;t last very long. We realized this and decided to work on a better, permanent server configuration that would support a more positive and growing community.

Today, I would like to present the new Moparcraft. Allow me to explain in ordered format:


[ol][li]A completely new world, freshly generated, with a custom designed spawn temple and nice seed.[/li]
[li]A complete reconfiguration, which includes no PVP, hard mode[/li]
[li]A 1000x1000 world border[/li]
[li]More community based commands, such as /home /spawn and a never seen before command /tpahere playername where you can request staff teleport to you if you need assistance[/li]
[li]Other smaller changes such as staff titles and so on so we can assist better, especially to new players[/li]
[li]You now have unlimited LWC locks, chests/furnaces are locked by default when placed so newer players aren&#39;t confused on commands. You can also protect rails. [/li]
[li]Creepers disabled, as in explosion damage, fire doesn&#39;t spread from flint and steel or from lava.[/li]
[li]Magnet chest enabled, items close to a chest go into it.[/li]
[li]The world map has been updated, you can now see a players HP, and where they are despite being in cover (inside a building, or in water and so on).[/li][/ol]


Moparcraft will be advertised with this configuration, it was been rigorously discussed over the past few months and has finally been put into action. I know many of you will lose a lot of items due to this huge change, but it is for the better of the server, and I can assure you it is the last time you will lose your items.

We still use the same rollback plugins (core protect). I, personally, hope we can leave any other issues I had with any of you, or you  had with others behind, and get a long as a community. If I have done something to bother you, please accept my sincerest apology. 

Best of luck all! As always, you can find a staff member on the IRC, or use our suggestions board.

(The rules listed at spawn are basic, it is suggested you stick to stated forum rules as it says there).</description>

<p>I feel like this is a good time to ask for a map extention. Like 25m or something, lol. Half of a stronghold I’m repairing is outside of the limits <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

i think the old map should be uploaded, lot of people, not just me, worked hard in their homes and i’d like to keep it as a save, and i’m sure i’m not the only one that’d like that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
at least consider the idea<br>
[/quote]<br>
it shouldnt be too hard. if it really is too big, then break up the download by sending it in packets. like 3 different downloads each holding a file contained a third of the files that makes up the world.[/quote]<br>
plus i wouldnt think w2 would be that huge of a file, so breaking into 3-4 downloads should make it small enough for mediafire or other file sharers.<br>
–i cant seem to edit my previous post which is why im adding on to it.</p>

it shouldnt be too hard. if it really is too big, then break up the download by sending it in packets. like 3 different downloads each holding a file contained a third of the files that makes up the world.</p>

<p>Exactly my point. Eventually it’s all just going to get old. People have already proven amazing builds can be done even with pvp in existance. There is no point in removing it.[/quote]</p>
<p>I personally don’t like to be killed, at all. It doesn’t matter about the “amazing builds” while pvp is on. pvping ends up with looting, and raiding. I don’t want to be a part of that.</p>
