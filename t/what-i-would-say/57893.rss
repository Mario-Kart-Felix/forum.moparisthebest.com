    <title>What I WOULD say-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-i-would-say/57893</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s what I *would* say on the RS Forums if 1) I had any membership left and 2) I could post it without getting banned :P

===================

Why do you hate autoers?

Why do you hate autoers? I bet &#39;cha it&#39;s because Jagex *trained* you to hate autoers, right?

It&#39;s because ever since you joined RS, Jagex has been your &quot;parent,&quot; shielding you from anything bad in the world.

Face it. How often do you find yourself unable to mine anything because a fleet of autoers got in your way? Not very often. Nothing a simple world switch can&#39;t help.

Most autoers choose the most remote, yet logical places to auto. (like on the border of the wilderness, and in lumby swamp.)

I bet it&#39;s safe to say that 85% of you don&#39;t even know one thing about what an autoer uses and what the task of autoing takes.

We don&#39;t auto because we hate Jagex. We don&#39;t do it because we hate the game. We don&#39;t do it because we&#39;re LAZY.

Actually, most autoers respect Jagex. Jagex has made a GREAT game, seriously. Good job.

As for an autoers job? Do you know how annoying it is to run a script for two hours, check to see how it&#39;s doing, only to find your character back in lumby, trying to chop bushes? It&#39;s somewhat annoying.

Jagex has made a great game. I hope you all keep playing it  ;)

===================

Like it? Now tell me how much of it was a lie (lol).</description>
