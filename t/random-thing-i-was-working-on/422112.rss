Obviously the samurai gets jumped at a dumpster. Only plausible explanation. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And actual modelers tend to only spend 2 hours max on a project at a time, or else you will want to blow your brains out in the end. Or get bored of the model and never return to it. Seen many people suggest having 2 or 3 projects models that you are working on that way you don’t get bored with one and never finish it.</p>
