    <title>[pi] you are already doing an emote [pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-you-are-already-doing-an-emote-pi/411848</link>
    <description>hello, i have been searching for a tut on this also looking in sources for this but so far no luck.
what i am looking for is a return code for emotes.
currently i can click skillcape emote then do a different emote example, zombie hand.
or i can spam click the skillcape emote and it will keep redoing the emote.
if anyone has a fix for this please help.
thankyou.</description>
