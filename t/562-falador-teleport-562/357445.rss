    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-falador-teleport-562/357445</link>
    <description>     Alright so in my 562 i added desks around the statue at falador teleport for help desk, i made commands for behind and outside the desk.
     My falador teleport on the spellbook teleports to the inside of the box, which file do i search for to change the coords which it teleports to, i haven&#39;t ever changed them on a 562, so idk, lol.

     Please help, i can&#39;t find how to do this on a 562, it would be highly appriciated if someone could help, hope i explained the issue enough, please help, thanks!</description>
