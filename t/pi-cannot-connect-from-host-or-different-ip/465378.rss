    <title>[PI] Cannot connect from host or different IP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-cannot-connect-from-host-or-different-ip/465378</link>
    <description>I am new with Java, mainly just putting something up for me and my friends to play at school.
 
I cannot connect to it though, from either my host computer, or my laptop, which is hooked up to a different network. On my host computer, I use 127.0.0.1 and I use my No-IP for my laptop. Is there anything I am doing wrong server sided?

I am portforwarded to 43594, the server is running as well as No-IP.</description>
