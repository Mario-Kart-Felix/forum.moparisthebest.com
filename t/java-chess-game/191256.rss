    <title>Java Chess Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-chess-game/191256</link>
    <description>I started a chess game project roughly two weeks ago. My purpose was to be able to say &quot;I created a game&quot;, since all my previous attempts have been epic failures. The reason I chose chess was because I became recently attached to the game ever since Jagex released funorb and I could play against other people. So, I started this Java Chess Game project. It started well, but steadily grew more complicated and confusing. The two people I relied on to help me with bugs couldn&#39;t read the code after the first week, leaving only me to fend for myself. I got through all the bugs that came at me except for a few painting issues and the final check and checkmate algorithms.

After two weeks of tedious hard-work on this game, the repeated failure of the check and checkmate algorithms took away all my inspiration to continue. So, I am releasing my chess game so that those who are willing to spend the time to understand the code, may learn something. I am sure I will be criticized for a few things with the code, but please consider that this entire game was hardcoded from the beginning.

The final version of chess is attached to this post.

Note: I believe only two methods were documented. I am not much of a documenter, therefore I didn&#39;t document much. I only documented the methods that took the most thinking so that I could map them out in an organized way before coding them.</description>

              <p>[quote=“supamagier, post:3, topic:191256”]nice game, but a few suggestions: let it tell who’s turn it is, and make it so that you only can move, or click your pieces when it’s your turn. Maybe also add the possibillities where you can move your pieces, highlight it or something.</p>

<p>If you go into the customize menu and enable the side panel, you can view whose turn it was.</p>

              <p>This a problem I’ve had which I have put off for a while and only now I am fixing it. This issue is that my deober has become so big and unwieldy that if I put it down and pick it up a few days latter I’m stuck thinking what the hell is that code for. In addition there are parts I haven’t looked at in ages and are basically ‘black boxes’ to me. As a result I am forced to rewrite or clean up most of my code with comments so I can actually understand it a month or two from now.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is: comment often.</p>
