    <title>Need a tut, when eating food, gets out of combat</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-tut-when-eating-food-gets-out-of-combat/125230</link>
    <description>You know, when you fight, when you eat one food, you don&#39;t have to re-click on the player, it just keeps fighting, i want it to bring you out of combat, so after eating, you must - reclick on the player that your fighting....

Would this be possible?  
thanks
