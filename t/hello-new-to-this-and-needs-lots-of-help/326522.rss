    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hello-new-to-this-and-needs-lots-of-help/326522</link>
    <description>hello ive been studying and working on couple of sources n clients just to practice. then i found a source that i would like to actualy use and it was battlescape nocturnal pk v1.

somethings i need help with is changing the client name and background ( i was able to do it in the other clients  i practiced on but this one i can not figure it out. ive looked in  GUI and in client.

another is how do i put my new server out there for others to check it out with me (just friends n stuff cuz  ik im not very good at this yet n got lots of work to do)

ive looked at many guides, watched plenty of videos just to get as far as i have.

(NEW UPDATE) hello i have figured out how to put my client out there with media fire. got my brother to try n download n it says error connecting for him. i port fowarding and everything but when i run my server it says a different port then 43594 plz help. also  i dont have to mess with code or anything in client or server so if ppl download my client it they can join my server right?.

if any1 has aim that wants to help im ron986986 n please post here.</description>
