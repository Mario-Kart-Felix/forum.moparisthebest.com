&lt;blockquote&gt;Eight teenagers have been arrested in Lakeland, Fla., on charges that they allegedly beat another teen in an &quot;animalistic attack&quot; so they could make a videotape to post on YouTube.

Seven of the teens remained in juvenile detention Tuesday, authorities said. A boy who was charged as an adult has been released on bail.

Victoria Lindsay was attacked on March 30 by six teenage girls when she arrived at a friend&#39;s home, authorities said.

One of the girls struck the 16-year-old victim on the head several times and then slammed her head into a wall, knocking her unconscious, according to an arrest report.

Later, according to a clip of the video that was released by the Polk County sheriff&#39;s office, the teens can be seen blocking a door and hitting Victoria.

&quot;When I saw my daughter in the emergency room, I didn&#39;t even recognize my own daughter,&quot; her father Patrick Lindsay, said a recent news conference in front of their Florida home. &quot;I just walked in and held her. I didn&#39;t want her to see me weep.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anybody&#39;s face disfigured like that.&quot;

While the beatings took place more than a week ago, Patrick and Talisa Lindsay said their daughter remains scared for her life.

&quot;She is having nightmares over it,&quot; said her mother, during a news conference outside their Florida home. &quot;She has multiple bruises from it, from her head all the way down.&quot;

[size=20pt]Her parents blamed the Internet for the incident.[/size]

&quot;These Web sites are creating a space for criminal activity, beating, fights,&quot; Patrick Lindsay said. &quot;MySpace, MTV&#39;s &#39;Jackass,&#39; they are enticing our children and desensitizing out children. Now, if they create the best shock video, they are the heroes. They think it is top dollar.&quot;

They described their daughter as a popular, honor-roll student and varsity cheerleader, who was &quot;very well liked.&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t deserve to be beat down like a dog,&quot; her father said. &quot;She thought she was going to die.&quot;

&quot;Just the shock of it happening to you and seeing your daughter in a deformity, that was horrific,&quot; Talisa Lindsay said. &quot;It&#39;s very emotional.&quot;

Rubbing his wife&#39;s back as she tried to gain her composure, Patrick Lindsay vowed to get justice for their daughter.

&quot;I&#39;m very upset with these Internet sites,&quot; he said. &quot;As far as I&#39;m concerned, MySpace is the anti-Christ for children. I&#39;m going to carry this as far as I can.&quot;

Sheriff Grady Judd told NBC&#39;s &quot;Today&quot; show on Tuesday that the incident was an &quot;absolutely an animalistic attack.&quot;

&quot;They lured her into the home for express purpose of filming the attack and posting it on the Internet,&quot; he said.

Christina Garcia, mother of one of the defendants, said her daughter had turned the tape over to police.&lt;/blockquote&gt;silab u crushed her omg...... y........ ??????</description>

<p>I hate the news… My friend burnt some grass in an abandoned field surrounded by abandoned train tracks, and the news said that him and 5 other teens returned 10 nights in a row and repeated their actions, and caused $2000 USD in damages, and the news people said that police caught them fleeing the scene,</p>
<p>The grass they burnt was about the size of a football field, and nothing but grass was burnt, and they only came back 3 nights, not 10, they where hanging out in a building near there and heard cops, they decided before the cops even found them to surrender so they just stood there as the cops came in.</p>

Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>A group of mates and I used to lure from mage bank to agility arena, from mage bank to east of the axe hut, and from greens to multi (north or south of the castle). :o<br>
Yeah, having 94+ magic and 96+ strength made all of this possible.</p>
<p>I guess I did beat up on people. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I’d do the same with my ranger, but you know. Jagex went and removed the wilderness.</p>

              <p>I find that absolutely pathetic and horrible. Beating someone up when they walk into your house, and then having your other friends there to help is just absolutely pathetic, and such a ‘girl move.’ Sure that may be a bit sexist, girls are usually known to ‘team up’ with others as to become bitches together rather than alone. I actually had to pause it about 0.30 through it and just think: "Who the hell would honestly beat someone up in a corner, and fight them when they don’t even want to fight.’ It’s such bullshit, I really don’t think they should be released from Juvi for a while, that is absolutely horrible.</p>
