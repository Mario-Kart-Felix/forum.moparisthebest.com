Hey there

I got the following proplem and cant seem to figure out how to fix it. 

For example sergeant steelwill has a chance to drop 3 sharks when killed.

If I get that drop the drop pile only shows 1 shark in the pile, but when I pick it up, it picks up 3 like it should.

Now I want to fix it so it shows up 3 sharks in the drop pile.

I&#39;ve been looking through: NPC.java (sendDrop method), Drop.java, and every .java that has the word: groundItem in it...

If anyone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>You set the drop to drop a ‘stack’ of 3. You didn’t set it to drop 3 individual shark.<br>
That would be why.</p>
<p>Look into the code that handles where it creates the ground item. You need to add a check in there to see if the item being placed on the ground is a note or not and if it’s stackable. If it’s not a note and it’s not stackable, make it drop the single items (if the stack is greater than 1). Otherwise, if it is noted, or is stackable, make it drop the entire stack at once.</p>
<p>I can’t be much more help until I see your code, as I don’t know the structure or just about anything related to 718.</p>
