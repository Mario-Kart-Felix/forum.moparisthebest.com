    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-issue/336109</link>
    <description>Hello,

I tried entering 127.0.0.1 on my moparscape client but I can&#39;t find anyone else.
Can someone help me?

Edit:
Well. So much for this attempt at a joke as I was retarded enough not to see I posted it in General Site Discussions. Fuck.





Lawl. Holla at Greeny if he&#39;s still here.</description>

<p>Congrats you reported me. You got some sort of personal vendetta against me and you don’t even know me. I’m not going to pull a you and flame you for no purpose. Grow up, learn some respect and get to know someone before you start throwing obscenities at them. If anything, yeah my joke isn’t funny because it failed to reach the point but it was an old joke from a long time ago. Anyone that was here long ago knows how many of these topics were posted in a serious manner and I was making a joke. If anything, you deserve a warning as well. You might want to learn some communication skills, so you can survive in the real world.</p>
