    <title>Playing RS at school</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playing-rs-at-school/2241</link>
    <description>I got the proxy thing down, but what doens&#39;t work is the server. Th wireless server at school doesn&#39;t allow any form of outside servers(e.g.)If in halo, it won&#39;t let reach outside internet servers. So I was wondering some socket servers programs or something like that can be used to bypass? Kinda of a Proxy for the server itself.[br][size=1]Posted at: May 01, 2006, 06:32:25 am[/size][hr]Can I get the port and IP address for runescape?[br][size=1]Posted at: May 01, 2006, 07:51:03 am[/size][hr]Does a port scanner have to do with anything?
Coz I put it to enable rs port and ip. Will it work?</description>

<p>That’d be my school. They are retarded. They only block the obvious (pron, etc) but it can be easily passed by a proxy… they think they have all of them blocked but there are still plenty that work… what morons. not even kidding.</p>
