    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bank-pin-i-havei-t-all-set-up-but-whaat-also-items-able-to-drop/407039</link>
    <description>Hello, i really need to know how to make item&#39;s be visable once dropped by a player. I have a 317. I think it&#39;s delta. Not sure. But i can&#39;t drop items. = No dro partys 

Also, i have everything coded for a bank pin. character-pin = 9999 , But everytime i set it, it says wrong pin. Does anyone know how to fix this ?. And does anyone know if it&#39;s possible to make an NPC Be able to set up a bank pin. Instead of manually having to do it ? Kthankss</description>
