    <description>[b]Loading server&#39;s objects from a client.[/b]

I was using [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,351106.0.html]peterbjornx&#39;s Map Editor[/url], to create my own custom server. Because using Runescape maps is so dull, plus I wanted my server to be different. 

Now I loaded the cache, and created a couple cool islands. As you know, however, when you load walls from the server they are invisible. You cannot walk past them, as they are there, but you cannot see them.

So I was thinking, and thought that you would most likely have to load the objects through the cache in the client. This would therefore spawn them so they work, but it would also put them on the minimap. I have been trying to learn how to load this, and do this, but I have had no sucess at all. Does anyone know an efficent way to load the walls &amp; objects through the client?</description>
