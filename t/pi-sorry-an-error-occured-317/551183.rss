    <description>Hello there, I am facing an issue with my Mac.
I&#39;m trying to run my client that I&#39;m working on, first of all as I have mentioned in my &quot;Post&quot; Before, that I am getting error connecting to server, that&#39;s not fixed yet. However, I am facing yet another issue.
Old Post: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,669971.0.html
Here&#39;s the problem I am facing; Screenshot: http://prntscr.com/6wis32
Here&#39;s the error when I try running the client; 
[CODE]
Error: loaderror Starting up 20
Exception in thread &quot;Thread-1&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException
	at client.cleanUpForQuit(client.java:5064)
	at RSApplet.exit(RSApplet.java:132)
	at RSApplet.run(RSApplet.java:126)
	at client.run(client.java:4846)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)
[/CODE]
Does anybody know what it means?
I have the cache set at the right place, Name is correct and it&#39;s assigned to; User.home
Firewall is off, ports are open, nothing blocking anything..
Any help at all is greatly appreciated.</description>
