    <title>PlayTV release date announced :D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playtv-release-date-announced-d/221061</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;PSU.com&quot;]The rollout of PlayTV in Europe will begin in just under two months time. The first country to receive Sony&#39;s clever little Freeview box will be the UK on September 10 followed by the rest of Europe by December.

PlayTV is Sony&#39;s digital video recorder with built-in Freeview for PlayStation 3. It will let you watch digital TV, browse what&#39;s on with its slick Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) and let you record a different channel to the one you&#39;re watching. You&#39;ll be able to set it to record entire series of programmes as their shown, as well as record whilst playing games.

That last part was a hefty challenge for Sony, but David Reeves, President of SCE Europe, said it was planned right from the start.

&quot;It was very difficult for some of the tech guys but we had to include it in the firmware upgrade, 2.41, but it&#39;s done now.&quot;

So come September 10, and assuming you get hold of a PlayTV unit, you&#39;ll be all ready to go. Reeves has previously revealed that PlayTV will retail for €99, but a UK price has yet to be announced. Those of you in Australia and New Zealand will also be able to get your hands on the sexy device in January or February.[/quote]

I WILL be picking this gem for the PS3, and now I will have a reason to move the PS3 in to my bedroom (was planning to with the Video Download service, but looks like I wont be getting that for some time :() :D</description>
