    <title>Look here! Ideas for a F2P PKing/Skilling server!</title>

    <description>[b]**()Server Ideas()**[/b]

Don&#39;t post here if you&#39;re not going to add anything helpful. If you don&#39;t like the ideas, then ignore them. Think of better ideas.

[b]THE IDEAS[/b]

[b]F2P-Based[/b]: No P2P items, areas, spells, or skills.

-It will be a mix of PKing and skilling.

-No dueling.

[b]Money[/b]: It seems that the only use for money on this server, is to buy items that you can&#39;t make yourself, such as arrows, bolts, strength potions (NOTE: I might add an NPC to exchange spider eggs and limpwurt roots for strength potions), etc.

-People who only train 1 type of non-combat skill, such as fishing, may not need money, either, since they will probably trade food certificates for armour and weapons, for example.

[b]New landscape[/b]. The wilderness will be shrunken (the northern border will probably be a few tiles north of the chaos altar, the eastern border will remain unchanged, and the western border will be at the zombie graveyard). 

-The new city will have shops and a bank to the north, near the wilderness border. To the south, there will be a dock and fishing spots. In the south-east, there will be an area filled with rocks for mining, with a furnace and anvils nearby for smithing. NPCs will also be there to cert your items. In the south-west, there will be a large area filled with various NPCs to train combat stats on. There will be an area reserved for mini-games. I&#39;m not sure yet how large it will be. 

-The city will be surrounded by water, as all other areas (except for the wilderness) will be turned to water.

-I dislike &quot;PKing&quot; servers because everyone feels the need to get 99 strength (or max out in some other combat stat) before going to PK. 

-Here, I&#39;ll encourage people to go PKing at lower levels. Low-level PKing will be a large part of this server. There will be PKing of all levels, though; there&#39;s just an emphasis on low level PKing.

-The XP rate won&#39;t be too low, or too high. I&#39;m thinking [b]8x-13x XP rates[/b], for combat stats. For non-combat levels, the XP rate will be much higher. I personally didn&#39;t enjoy spending hours grinding to get a smithing or mining level, and most people don&#39;t, either.

-I was thinking of making the Master Fisher give out free tuna or salmon. Lobsters and swordfish will have to be fished by the players. Fortunately, there will be a bank next to the fishing area, allowing players to easily collect food for PKing.

[b]Shops[/b]:All armor up to addy, and all 2hs and battle axes up to addy, will be available in shops. 

-There will be a seperate shop for items that you can&#39;t make yourself, such as bows, arrows, bolts, crossbows, etc.

[b]Runes[/b]: Air, water, fire, earth, body, and mind runes will be in shop. Other runes will be dropped by monsters.

[b]Rune Items[/b]:Rune items can be gained from mini-games, winning tournaments (which will be discussed later on), and killing players for PK Points. 

-Rune items can also be smithed.

-Also, killing monsters is a good way to get rune items. Low level and high level monsters will drop them, but you have a better chance of getting rune from high level monsters. The drop rates are going to be low, as I want rune to have value, and for another reason, explained below.

[b]Low-level PKing[/b] This will be a big part of my server. Personally, I am a big fan of low-level PKing, and I dislike high level PKing. I also want to revisit the time of low-level PKing, when people used steel 2hs, black 2hs (and axes), mith 2hs, and addy 2hs, instead of rune 2hs.

[b]Tournament system[/b]. This can work with 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. people. So, let&#39;s say that 8 people participate (and they all have to be within, perhaps, 5 levels of each other, people whose combat levels are closer to each others&#39;, are paired with that person). There will be 4 1v1 fights, then 2 1v1 fights with the winners of the previous fights, and then a final 1v1 fight with the winners of the previous fight. The winner wins a prize, such as full rune, or some rune weapons. I&#39;d rather not give out rares, since it&#39;s a PKing server. This isn&#39;t going to be too complicated- an NPC will teleport the participants into a box, and they can only get into the tournament area by having a moderator or administrator summon them. This will prevent players from interfering with the tournaments.

[b]PK Points[/b]: They will be obtained by killing players, and you can speak to an NPC to exchange them for items, such as full rune, rune 2hs, 100k cash (or a similar amount), etc. I don&#39;t plan on putting rares into the game.

[b]Moderators[/b]:I will choose player moderators, to go around look for autoers, keeping order in the game, etc. Anyone who abuses their power will immediately be demoted (a possible ban, too, depending on the severity of the power abuse)

-However, player moderators, or anyone with &quot;special powers&quot;, are NOT allowed to PK on this server (EXCEPT, in a case that I will describe later on. You must use a regular account to PK on, or you&#39;ll be demoted. I will also want to PK on my server, and I will try to PK fairly. I won&#39;t be PKing on an administrator account. 

[b]Autoers[/b]: I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s fair to ban people just for autoing, but I do feel that a punishment is necessary. So, anyone that is caught autoing, will be teleported to a jail cell. There will be a banker, and another NPC in the cell, as well. You access your bank, get 1,000,000 coins, and talk to the NPC, who says &quot;I can get you out of here for 1,000,000 coins.&quot; If you choose &quot;Yes, do it&quot; as the option, you will be teleported back to the city. If not, then you will stay in jail until you pay the fine.

[b]Administrator Deathmatch[/b]: This is a rather interesting idea that I thought of. Administrators can set stats, so they can fight a player, at whatever level the player is. The good thing about this, is that anyone can participate. I&#39;ll elaborate more on this, later on.

[b]Events, and Prizes[/b]: No rares will be introduced to this server. For events, the winners will receive items, such as lobster/swordfish certificates, rune items, coins, etc., depending on the magnitude of the event.

I will be adding more ideas later. Please tell me if you think they are good or not, so far.

Here&#39;s a little map to give you a basic idea of what the new landscape will look like (I&#39;ll add the wilderness later)

The wilderness is directly north of the city. And, no, I am not going to use Varrock as the city. It will be custom; this is just an example, for now.

Feel free to use them in your own server... no credit is necessary! :P</description>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b"><strong>()Server Ideas()</strong></span></p>
<p>Don’t post here if you’re not going to add anything helpful. If you don’t like the ideas, then ignore them. Think of better ideas.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">THE IDEAS</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">F2P-Based</span>: No P2P items, areas, spells, or skills.</p>
<p>-It will be a mix of PKing and skilling.</p>
<p>-No dueling.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Money</span>: It seems that the only use for money on this server, is to buy items that you can’t make yourself, such as arrows, bolts, strength potions (NOTE: I might add an NPC to exchange spider eggs and limpwurt roots for strength potions), etc.</p>
<p>-People who only train 1 type of non-combat skill, such as fishing, may not need money, either, since they will probably trade food certificates for armour and weapons, for example.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">New landscape</span>. The wilderness will be shrunken (the northern border will probably be a few tiles north of the chaos altar, the eastern border will remain unchanged, and the western border will be at the zombie graveyard).</p>
<p>-The new city will have shops and a bank to the north, near the wilderness border. To the south, there will be a dock and fishing spots. In the south-east, there will be an area filled with rocks for mining, with a furnace and anvils nearby for smithing. NPCs will also be there to cert your items. In the south-west, there will be a large area filled with various NPCs to train combat stats on. There will be an area reserved for mini-games. I’m not sure yet how large it will be.</p>
<p>-The city will be surrounded by water, as all other areas (except for the wilderness) will be turned to water.</p>
<p>-I dislike “PKing” servers because everyone feels the need to get 99 strength (or max out in some other combat stat) before going to PK.</p>
<p>-Here, I’ll encourage people to go PKing at lower levels. Low-level PKing will be a large part of this server. There will be PKing of all levels, though; there’s just an emphasis on low level PKing.</p>
<p>-The XP rate won’t be too low, or too high. I’m thinking <span class="bbcode-b">8x-13x XP rates</span>, for combat stats. For non-combat levels, the XP rate will be much higher. I personally didn’t enjoy spending hours grinding to get a smithing or mining level, and most people don’t, either.</p>
<p>-I was thinking of making the Master Fisher give out free tuna or salmon. Lobsters and swordfish will have to be fished by the players. Fortunately, there will be a bank next to the fishing area, allowing players to easily collect food for PKing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Shops</span>:All armor up to addy, and all 2hs and battle axes up to addy, will be available in shops.</p>
<p>-There will be a seperate shop for items that you can’t make yourself, such as bows, arrows, bolts, crossbows, etc.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Runes</span>: Air, water, fire, earth, body, and mind runes will be in shop. Other runes will be dropped by monsters.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Rune Items</span>:Rune items can be gained from mini-games, winning tournaments (which will be discussed later on), and killing players for PK Points.</p>
<p>-Rune items can also be smithed.</p>
<p>-Also, killing monsters is a good way to get rune items. Low level and high level monsters will drop them, but you have a better chance of getting rune from high level monsters. The drop rates are going to be low, as I want rune to have value, and for another reason, explained below.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Low-level PKing</span> This will be a big part of my server. Personally, I am a big fan of low-level PKing, and I dislike high level PKing. I also want to revisit the time of low-level PKing, when people used steel 2hs, black 2hs (and axes), mith 2hs, and addy 2hs, instead of rune 2hs.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Tournament system</span>. This can work with 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. people. So, let’s say that 8 people participate (and they all have to be within, perhaps, 5 levels of each other, people whose combat levels are closer to each others’, are paired with that person). There will be 4 1v1 fights, then 2 1v1 fights with the winners of the previous fights, and then a final 1v1 fight with the winners of the previous fight. The winner wins a prize, such as full rune, or some rune weapons. I’d rather not give out rares, since it’s a PKing server. This isn’t going to be too complicated- an NPC will teleport the participants into a box, and they can only get into the tournament area by having a moderator or administrator summon them. This will prevent players from interfering with the tournaments.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PK Points</span>: They will be obtained by killing players, and you can speak to an NPC to exchange them for items, such as full rune, rune 2hs, 100k cash (or a similar amount), etc. I don’t plan on putting rares into the game.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Moderators</span>:I will choose player moderators, to go around look for autoers, keeping order in the game, etc. Anyone who abuses their power will immediately be demoted (a possible ban, too, depending on the severity of the power abuse)</p>
<p>-However, player moderators, or anyone with “special powers”, are NOT allowed to PK on this server (EXCEPT, in a case that I will describe later on. You must use a regular account to PK on, or you’ll be demoted. I will also want to PK on my server, and I will try to PK fairly. I won’t be PKing on an administrator account.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Autoers</span>: I don’t think that it’s fair to ban people just for autoing, but I do feel that a punishment is necessary. So, anyone that is caught autoing, will be teleported to a jail cell. There will be a banker, and another NPC in the cell, as well. You access your bank, get 1,000,000 coins, and talk to the NPC, who says “I can get you out of here for 1,000,000 coins.” If you choose “Yes, do it” as the option, you will be teleported back to the city. If not, then you will stay in jail until you pay the fine.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Administrator Deathmatch</span>: This is a rather interesting idea that I thought of. Administrators can set stats, so they can fight a player, at whatever level the player is. The good thing about this, is that anyone can participate. I’ll elaborate more on this, later on.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Events, and Prizes</span>: No rares will be introduced to this server. For events, the winners will receive items, such as lobster/swordfish certificates, rune items, coins, etc., depending on the magnitude of the event.</p>
<p>I will be adding more ideas later. Please tell me if you think they are good or not, so far.</p>
<p>Here’s a little map to give you a basic idea of what the new landscape will look like (I’ll add the wilderness later)</p>
<p>The wilderness is directly north of the city. And, no, I am not going to use Varrock as the city. It will be custom; this is just an example, for now.<br>
