Instead of having to type in the ip we want to make it so that when you click login the ip is already there.

Thanks,

<p>Or, you could do it the correct way, replace it with<br>
<span class="mention">@whi</span>@Server IP:</p>
<p>And search for server = “”; and add ur server ip in between the ""s.</p>
<p>Also, search for setserver("", 43594);</p>
<p>again, add your ip in between the “” 's</p>
<p>Hope I helped.</p>
<p>Think about it like this:<br>
“This quote is gramatically correct.”<br>
