    <title>How to see files in client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-see-files-in-client/452783</link>
    <description>Okay so i downloaded this client for my server and it works pretty well for weapons and etc. I really wanna use this client.
When I extracted the client after downloading, i saw that there were class files and stuff.
When i completely extracted it, there was on &quot;run.bat&quot;, &quot;read me&quot; and thats about it and class files or anything were there.
Was wondering how maybe i could see files to add special weapons and stuff to the client, if any way possible? Thanks very much =D

<p>if you do not have the .java files i just recommend you get a new client. that one will be a bitch to edit lol.<br>
if you only have the .class files you would have to decompile, decipher, and recode every file you wanted to edit.</p>
