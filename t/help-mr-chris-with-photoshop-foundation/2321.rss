    <title>Help Mr.Chris With Photoshop Foundation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-mr-chris-with-photoshop-foundation/2321</link>
    <description>Ok, instead of me posting noobish help all over the graphic forums, I decided I should keep mine all in one place (If it&#39;s ok with Mopar, of course :D)

Anyway, my current question is:

Is My First Ever Graphic Any Good For A First Try?

+

In this thread - [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,2626.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,2626.0.html[/url] - if you look at Got_Shines&#39; signature, I would like to know how he got the background with the character the same colour so it looks like it is part of the background like that. Or did he just find a ready made background like that?

To answer any of these questions please -

              <p>heres my comments on the picture.</p>

<p>Yeah, you did a sweet job for your first try but here are some things you should work on:</p>

<p>Your picture looks like it was cut off at the top, so I would suggest restricting the canvas so that no one can really see the blunt top of the render.</p>

<p>With your water reflection, it looks good but I would suggest giving it more of a  3d feel to it by messing with it using the transform tool[im sure there is a specific tool right now but im at school :P]</p>

<p>[hr]</p>

<p>As to the render question, it is REALLY simple, especially with the render that you used.  All you would need to do is copy the image, make a new project in CS2, and paste the render.  [photoshop should have made a canvas according to the clipboard's size].</p>

<p>Next, especially in the case of a conrtasting background like your render did [its full blue in the background], you would select the blue using either the magic wand tool, or go to SELECT &gt; COLOR RANGE [ONLY USE THIS IF THERE IS NONE OF THE <a>blue</a>[/blue] COLOR IN YOUR ACTUAL RENDER!!!].</p>

<p>After that, go ahead and delete the background and then your render is ready.<br>From there al you have to do is drag and drop into your main image.</p>
