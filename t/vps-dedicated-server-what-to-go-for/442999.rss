    <title>VPS/Dedicated Server - What To Go For?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vps-dedicated-server-what-to-go-for/442999</link>
    <description>Hi, so I&#39;m developing a private server (see signature) and I am using a blog to post my developments and making money via Google AdSense to buy a host.

I&#39;ve just started receiving valid clicks from AdSense, so wanted to shop around and see what price I should aim for, and what type of host I should buy. I have no experience with this, I&#39;ve even no idea how to set it up once I get it (will cross that bridge when it comes), so I was wondering if you could tell me your experiences about types of hosts (VPS, Dedicated etc.), and which reliable companies you used, so that I can get some sort of idea of what I should be looking for.</description>
