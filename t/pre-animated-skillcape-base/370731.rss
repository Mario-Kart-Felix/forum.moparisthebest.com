[center]The ugly colors are for people to differentiate the sections.
The MQO file contains the PRI:, TSKIN:, and VSKIN1: &quot;layers&quot;.
Don&#39;t edit the first 255 materials labeled 1-255. That is part of the masterpalette, which is used to code the priorities and tskin.
Click [url=http://uppit.com/y2eid52ckobz/Pre-animated_skillcape_base.mqo]here[/url] to download.
All I ask of you is that you do NOT upload your fancy new custom recolored skillcape to the models section, unless you&#39;re ready for people to flame you.
The purpose of this is for people who know the basics of metasequoia, but don&#39;t know how to do skillcapes. Don&#39;t try and upload a &quot;show-off&quot; design of your skillcape, because nobody really cares.

<p>its for noobie modelors, its pre animated and they can just recoler it to whatever they want and add there own thing, it’d be ridiculous to release a recolor and not give proper credits, i mean, recolors dont need to be released, im sure he released this for people to recolor and add for there server, not to release and say haha look at my pimp ass cape cause i just leech and recolor</p>

<p>We flame you because you’re an attention whore. You’ve posted about 3 threads saying “Hey everybody, I’m quitting.” And then come back later.</p>
<p>And “read my posts in ways other than negative” wasn’t all you said.</p>
<p>“I never did anything to start” read your first post on this thread? You called me a “fagget”.</p>

<p>Sorry for having my own opinion. I don’t want attention I just want respect.<br>
Just stop, this happened ages ago just let it go :D[/quote]</p>
<p>There’s a difference between having an opinion and blatantly insulting someone. And telling everyone you’re quitting 3 times doesn’t get you respect.</p>
