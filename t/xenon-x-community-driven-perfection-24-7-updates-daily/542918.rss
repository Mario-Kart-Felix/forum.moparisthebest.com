[FONT=Comic Sans MS][SIZE=5]What is the Xenon-X project and why?[/SIZE][/FONT]

Xenon-X is a server that has gone through many name changes throughout it&#39;s development; However during the last month I&#39;ve managed to get together a group of closed BETA testers and contact some old friends for responsible staff members. We&#39;ve been working hard on getting the server to exceptional quality; However I decided it would be time to start posting an Project Thread so I could get some recognition for the project.  I had opened one previously, back when development first started under a different name, but I never updated it due to being busy most of the time and it&#39;s been buried and lost throughout the Projects forum. 


[FONT=Comic Sans MS][SIZE=5]What are your intentions for Xenon-X?[/SIZE][/FONT]

Xenon-X is being made for the soul-purpose of entertaining and maintaining a community. Unlike the other numerous servers that are being born in the day and age we aren&#39;t trying to make money from it; However due to the fact that expenses are a thing we will offer small perks to people that choose to pay a &quot;membership&quot; fee to help keep the server running. Our goal is mainly to just make the server self-sustaining. We&#39;ve decided that we&#39;re going to split the funds 80/20 between Server-Development and Personal profit. 20% of any additional money earned through our membership system will be split evenly throughout all of the staff members of Xenon-X, 20% of it will go towards rewards for tournaments that we&#39;re going to host in which our players can earn money, and the other 60% will be saved for future updates and professional services such as web-development, client-development, and any features that we want added at a professional level.

<p>Xenon-X is a server that has gone through many name changes throughout it’s development; However during the last month I’ve managed to get together a group of closed BETA testers and contact some old friends for responsible staff members. We’ve been working hard on getting the server to exceptional quality; However I decided it would be time to start posting an Project Thread so I could get some recognition for the project.  I had opened one previously, back when development first started under a different name, but I never updated it due to being busy most of the time and it’s been buried and lost throughout the Projects forum.</p>
