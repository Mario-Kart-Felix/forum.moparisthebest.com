    <title>[508] I need help with DropItem [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-i-need-help-with-dropitem-508/232704</link>
    <description>Okay so I recently added summoning to my server, and it&#39;s the correct version and everything. But now what I&#39;m trying to do is make a basic form of a pet... Now for right now I don&#39;t know how to make the pet follow you because I can&#39;t even make you drop the pet... So what I need is some help.

Here&#39;s my question:

How can I make cases in my DropItem.java file? 
I can make cases for ItemOption1, just not DropItem... So could someone show me how. Because if they can I can pretty much figure everything else out</description>
