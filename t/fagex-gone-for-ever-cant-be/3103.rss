    <description>[sub]Where is fagex? A lot of you are asking. Fagex is closed.

OMG why is fagex closed! Fagex is closed because of the repetitive threats from people. I have never been threatened so much in my life as I have in the last week. I am also not going to release names of people threatening because then it will get worse. I made a few change&#39;s to the staff, I was not finished I was still fixing things, and it&#39;s not exactly easy when you always have over 20 people messaging you about things. No wonder Juan wanted to sell this. I am trying my best to satisfy all of you, it is not easy I assure you. I have spent 1300$ USD so far and what have I gotten out of it? All I ask from you is the respect and trust in what i&#39;m doing.I have gotten yelled at, I have gotten threats, blackmail, hate. I try to save the most trusted and safe runescape community and then all I get in return is being flamed. I asked Josh a week ago if he could help me out, he agree&#39;d because he had nothing else to do. I introduce him here and you guy&#39;s go berzerek! If you do not like the change&#39;s then grind your teeth, or leave. The changes are for the best. Blue came, wanting to help, he has a list of thing&#39;s to do that he&#39;s been jotting down and it&#39;s his first day. He has been busting his ass off for you guy&#39;s and then you turn and spit in his face! I will not be putting Fagex up untill I think it should return. Even if this mean&#39;s closing it for good.


Great job guy&#39;s! Nice way to show Juan that you care about Fagex

              <p>Wow, wake up dude. That was like, yesterday. Dont you see the new message?</p>
<blockquote>Alright, I deceided to re-open fagex. I hope you have all had the time to think things thru. I know I did. I think alot of the problems where caused by people being mis-informed. I will try my best to explain the way the new staff works. Ok here we go.... as you have noticed, there are now some new ranks these are: 
<p>-Fagex Owner - Duh…</p>
<p>~Fagex Owner - He is the copyright owner of <a href="http://fagex.net" rel="nofollow noopener">fagex.net</a>. You should only PM him for technical errors or bugs. Odds are he will not answer your PM if you request a name change for example.</p>
<p>-Fagex Forum Head - These consist of the Head Admin(s), the Head Mod(s), the Head MM(s), the Head Police(s) and the Head Support(s).</p>
<p>~ Head Admin(s) - They access to the admin CP aswell as all forums. They any problems you might have. It is faster to PM them about a problem than to PM the fagex Owner.</p>
<p>~Head Mod(s) - They have access to all the forums aswell as the Admin CP. They are the leaders of the mod group and he makes sure they all do their jobs. If you have any problems with a mod(s) you can address him about it.</p>
<p>~Head MM(s) - They have access to all the forums. They are the leaders of the MiddleMen and make sure they all do their jobs. If you have any questions, or concerns about a MiddleMan or anything related to MiddleMen, you can Pm him.</p>
<p>~Head Police(s) - They have access to all forums.They are the leaders of the Sharez Mods and make sure they all do their jobs. If you have any troubles with the Sharez section you can PM him for assistance.</p>
<p>~Head Support(s) - They have access to all forums. They are the leaders of the Support Staff and make sure they all do their jobs. If you have any troubles with a Support Staff member you can PM him about it and he will assist you.</p>
<p>If you have a problem with one of those Forum Heads, you can PM the Head Admin(s) about it. If you have a problem with the Head Admin(s) you can PM the owner. As you can see this system is to keep the work load off of me so I can concentrate on what really matters, updates, updates, updates!</p>
<p>The rest of the staff is basicly the same as before nothing has really changed. I’ll breidly explain the duties of the Support Staff since it’s a new group and they are there to help you.</p>
<p>-Support Staff are there to assist all the new members who have joined fagex. If you have a question on how to find stuff, or a question about some forum content then you can PM the Support Staff. They are there to make your life easyer and more enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s about it. I hope this clears things. So all the people who are saying we dont have enough admins, well we do. We are currently up to 3 admins and I think that is more than enough.</p>
<p>I hope this is the last time I have to shut down the boards like this. I hope you will all follow the system so that you can give me a break.</p>
<p>Enjoy <a href="http://fagex.net" rel="nofollow noopener">fagex.net</a>, I purchased it for you.</p>
<p>FireFly</p>

<p>Btw, FireFly is a member of Afelhem rofl. I was kinda suprised when I saw his name.</p>
