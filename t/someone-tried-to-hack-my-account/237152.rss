    <title>Someone tried to Hack my account</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/someone-tried-to-hack-my-account/237152</link>
    <description>Hey,
Can someone look into this?
My account got hacked for a little bit, like a month or so until I just recently got it backed. Was the hash codes accidentally released or something? They just tried it again but this time I got like five emails saying my password was attempting to be redone or whatever on moparscape. Wtf? So anyways, I just wanted to see if you tracked the I.P. of users trying to reset passwords.
Also,
Whatup?</description>
