    <description>How to create a PI server :)
Well.. First off, I have not ever created a server from scratch, I use a source, and a client, and I add on to it. 
I am currently using MTP v2, which is now Dubeast-pkz. I have added MANY MANY things. 
First off, is the requirements computerwise.
--=--=--=--=&gt;Requirements&lt;=--=--=--=--=--
-Winrar
-ability to access router settings
-Good internet connection
-a Source with a project insanity base
-a client that works with the source
-the ability to read and follow along

FIRST OFF:::
once you have all the requirements, we are going to do the easy stuff first. (its all easy :))
in the URL bar, type in your default ip address. (this can be found by going into the start menu on windows, and typing in cmd, once you open it, type ipconfig, then press enter. It will show you your default ip which is usually 192.168.1.1
once you enter it, it may ask you for a username and password. by default, try one of these combinations:
U: admin
P: admin

U: (nothing)
P: admin

U: root
P: root

U: admin
P: root

or any combination of those.

If you don&#39;t know and maybe your parents set it, try a birthday of a family member, a nickname, a name, a common password used by a family member, or even &quot;password&quot; (who would use it, seriously?)


Alright, once you are in (I use Linxys) 
Go to the tab &quot;Applications and Gaming&quot;
Then click the subtab of &quot;Single PortForwarding&quot;  (additional portforwarding for your router is found at Portforward.com, find your router type there by using the ctrl + f, the type/model of your router is usually found on the side or bottom in fine print.
There, it will teach you how to portforward, for today I am only teaching you how to do this with Linxys.)

Once you are in Single Portforwarding,  you are going to want to go back to the cmd that you typed ipconfig into. 
check the computers default ip.
here is an example
192.168.1.106 (not mine)
you are going to want to check the box and fill in the last 3 digits 192.168.1.&quot;106&quot; (the one with quotes around it) (not always the 106, type in your last 3 digits)

then, type in for the title as rsps, and have it forward 43594 to 43594 as BOTH

Then save your settings.

You are portforwarded!

here are the different types of sources:
317: basically runescape when it came out. the original runescape2
474: a mix of 317 and 508, hard to make a webclient out of.
508: has everything up to the armadyl goldsword, if not, it is a custom.
525: has everything up to d claws, but no HD graphics yet.
562: has HD, and everything above!
614: hard to set up, requires cache (pronounced &quot;CASH&quot;)

the difficulty level and computer requirements increase in that order (317+)

Ok, For the source, try to download a basic one you like off of Moparscape.org, don&#39;t leech though, make sure to give the real creator credit.

And a client usually comes with the source.

Now, You are going to want to open up the client, and open up client.java.  
 
Press ctrl+f or f3 on your keyboard and it brings up the search.

type in &quot;server=&quot; (without the quotes)

if you want to make it public, you are going to need to create a no-ip, I will get to that in a bit

type in 127.0.0.1 (which is local play only)

and press save.

Now, double click the COMPILE button, if you can&#39;t find it, search it in the search bar, it is a Windows Batch File.

now open up the source, and click run.

now go back to the client and click run
(in that order always)

It should work!


now to get it public!
now you need a network!

Hamachi is usable, but requires everyone who wants to play your server to download it and join your network. which is why I use No-ip.

go to No-ip.com

sign up (very quick and easy)

and create a new host

name it what you want, and make it so it is .no-ip.biz ... .no-ip.org , those are the best to use.

Once you do that. Install it, and open it up

click select hosts

check off your server one so the box is checked.

and click ok.

there should be 3 green checks

is the bottom isn&#39;t green, click refresh

now, go back into your client and open up &quot;client.java&quot; again.

search &quot;server=&quot; again without quotes

and change from 127.0.0.1, to your new no-ip &quot;examplescape.no-ip.biz&quot;

now, try playing it. make sure no-ip is up

open up source, run it, and run client after that, respectively.

now you are good to go! any further questions? pm me! glad to help!

took me an hour to write this! only takes you 5 seconds to say thanks / rep :)

5 seconds to make me happy!
(sounds like I might have heard that somewhere)

lol thanks again guys!

any questions? pm me or comment! ty again</description>

check the computers default ip.<br>
here is an example<br>
192.168.1.106 (not mine)<br>
you are going to want to check the box and fill in the last 3 digits 192.168.1.“106” (the one with quotes around it) (not always the 106, type in your last 3 digits)</p>
<p>then, type in for the title as rsps, and have it forward 43594 to 43594 as BOTH</p>
<p>Then save your settings.</p>
<p>You are portforwarded!</p>
<p>here are the different types of sources:<br>
317: basically runescape when it came out. the original runescape2<br>
474: a mix of 317 and 508, hard to make a webclient out of.<br>
508: has everything up to the armadyl goldsword, if not, it is a custom.<br>
525: has everything up to d claws, but no HD graphics yet.<br>
562: has HD, and everything above!<br>
614: hard to set up, requires cache (pronounced “CASH”)</p>
<p>the difficulty level and computer requirements increase in that order (317+)</p>
<p>Ok, For the source, try to download a basic one you like off of <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a>, don’t leech though, make sure to give the real creator credit.</p>
<p>And a client usually comes with the source.</p>
<p>Now, You are going to want to open up the client, and open up client.java.</p>
<p>Press ctrl+f or f3 on your keyboard and it brings up the search.</p>
<p>type in “server=” (without the quotes)</p>
<p>if you want to make it public, you are going to need to create a no-ip, I will get to that in a bit</p>
<p>type in 127.0.0.1 (which is local play only)</p>
<p>and press save.</p>
<p>Now, double click the COMPILE button, if you can’t find it, search it in the search bar, it is a Windows Batch File.</p>
<p>now open up the source, and click run.</p>
<p>now go back to the client and click run<br>
(in that order always)</p>
<p>It should work!</p>
<p>now to get it public!<br>
now you need a network!</p>
<p>Hamachi is usable, but requires everyone who wants to play your server to download it and join your network. which is why I use No-ip.</p>
<p>go to <a href="http://No-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">No-ip.com</a></p>
<p>sign up (very quick and easy)</p>
<p>and create a new host</p>
<p>name it what you want, and make it so it is .no-ip.biz … .no-ip.org , those are the best to use.</p>
<p>Once you do that. Install it, and open it up</p>
<p>click select hosts</p>
<p>check off your server one so the box is checked.</p>
<p>and click ok.</p>
<p>there should be 3 green checks</p>
<p>is the bottom isn’t green, click refresh</p>
<p>now, go back into your client and open up “client.java” again.</p>
<p>search “server=” again without quotes</p>
<p>and change from 127.0.0.1, to your new no-ip “examplescape.no-ip.biz”</p>
<p>now, try playing it. make sure no-ip is up</p>
<p>open up source, run it, and run client after that, respectively.</p>
