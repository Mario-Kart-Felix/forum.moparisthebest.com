    <description>Interested in everyones most &quot;momentous&quot; moments while in the RSPS community.

Could range from a moment where you made a lot of money to a moment where you just coded something spectacular.

it has to store the data for the remember me function somewhere. user/pass can’t be changed dynamically in code without loading from somewhere. but it shouldn’'t be stored in plaintext at the very least…</p>
