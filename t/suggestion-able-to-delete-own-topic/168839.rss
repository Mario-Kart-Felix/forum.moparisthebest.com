Then some noobs would make a topic lock it and unlock it and so on thinking they’re funny.[/quote]<br>
like me.</p>
<p>imo only responsible posters should be able too, like silver lining.</p>

The person having a go at the guy who bumped it then looks like the bumper, and yeah. Problem time if it isn’t looked into properly.</p>
