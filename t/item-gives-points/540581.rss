              <p>I’ve never worked with anything higher than a 508 (even with a 508 I barely know anything), but since you already have an example of something that works (ex: squeal of fortune), use the code that is used with your example and modify it to your needs…</p>
<p>this would be for a 317, inside clickitem.java:</p>
<blockquote>       case ITEMID:   //can have multiple IDs perform the same action this way
       case ITEMID: //item id that you are using
              c.pkPoints += 20; // adds 20 pk points to the existing amount of pk points
          break; //breaks out of this case</blockquote>
<p>note that I just made this off of the fly</p>
