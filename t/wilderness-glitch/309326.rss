    <description>Theres this issue on my server that may not seem too big, but annoys me everytime I run across it.
When enter the wild, the wild icon and the wilderness level I&#39;m in appears at the bottom right corner of the screen like its supposed to.
But when you leave the wilderness, the icon does not go away and the wilderness level is stuck at 1.
(If you go back into the wild passed level 1, then the level will continue; it is only stuck at 1 if you are not in the wild)

Any suggestions?</description>
