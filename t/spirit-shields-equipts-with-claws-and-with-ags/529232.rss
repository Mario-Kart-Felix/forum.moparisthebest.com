The people that made the 700+ wrote them more efficiently. Trust me, they’re not as easy as a 317.</p>

I still have the same problem… Cant figure it out. I think something happend when i used itemdef editor, like i added upgradeable weapons, with option “upgrade”. I did it for claws and ags only. So i changed it to null;Wield;Upgrade;null;drop;</p>

You know why you can’t find anything on this? Because a bunch of noobs were like “omg a new base is released it has all runescape’s current stuff, let’s use it” and not one actually knew piss poor about Java, so a bunch of help topics got made, and made, and no one could answer them because all the 718+ programmers were too busy with their servers, leaving all the noobs helpless, so there isn’t any answers. And then the people like me, who do help, don’t care to learn 718s. which makes for a bunch of unanswered help topics.</p>
<p>So here’s what I say to you:</p>
<p>Go download a lower revision base, 317 would be a great start. PI isn’t good code, but it’s easy to learn. Delta is alright, but cluttered as fudge. Delta++ is a great type of delta server (it’s basically packaged delta, with some stability upgrades and cleanup). And then I think there’s Rune-Source or similar, that’s another 317.<br>
Learn from that and work your way up. Or go learn java from oracles site.[/quote]</p>
<p>No thank you? I allready found the problem, i was using 718 ItemDef editor. Which corrupted my cache. It dosent matter which revision i use, rsps coding is all the same. Higher revision has just more files and takes more time. I personaly dont like 317’s, thats why i starded with 667’s and worked my way out to 718/742 matrix sources. By the way, im using my source, have been working on it over a half year. Anyways… Thank you for your time.</p>

I would assume your item handler (PI uses item.java and itemassistant.java for this)<br>
[/quote]<br>
No, its not item.java and itemhandler dosent exist for me. Im using 718/742 Matrix source.[/quote]<br>
When I say “item handler” I mean the file that handles your items, it won’t necessarily be titled itemhandler.<br>
I don’t work with higher revisions, so I can’t be much help aside from a point in the correct direction.</p>
