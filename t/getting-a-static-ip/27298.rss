    <title>Getting a static ip?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-a-static-ip/27298</link>
    <description>I havn&#39;t been able to figure out the whole Static IP bit and I was also wondering how you get your server to run off of Hamachi. If anyone could help me, I would appreciate it much.

Also, my MSN is Ozzy_Ozbourn@hotmail.com, but I&#39;m at school right now and I won&#39;t be home for an hour and a half from when I post this so. Anyways, I would appreciate it very much if you helped me.

Thanks.</description>
