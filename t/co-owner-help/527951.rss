              <p>it depends on the reason.<br>
if you wanna give him the same set of commands as you, just give him the same playerrights.<br>
if you want him to have the current owner commands, and wanna add some for yourself, then give him owner rights, make a new command method (there is a method for admin commands, supportercommands, mod ommands… which is all then processed through a single method)</p>
<p>basically, if you want him to have the same codes as you, give him the same playerrights.<br>
if you him to have the same codes, but you want to add some only YOU can use, then message me, and ill walk you through it after work</p>
