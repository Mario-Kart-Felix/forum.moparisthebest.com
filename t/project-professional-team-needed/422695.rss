    <title>Project Professional-Team Needed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-professional-team-needed/422695</link>
    <description>I am looking to put together a team of coders and de-buggers to create the most professional server out there. This project will start from scratch, and i will pay for a website, and advertising. I know we can get this server to 500+ online 24/7 within the first month of being up and running on our website. I want to put up a webclient and a downloadable client. I also have a ton of ideas for the website alone. Please reply if you are interested. The format will be:

Name:
Age:
Country:
Position interested in:
Experience:
Hours Available to work per day/weekend/week:
About you:
How good are you at coding:

Beta tester positions are not currently open.

The open positions are: CODERS 0/2
                                BUG FINDERS 0/3

I know this server will be great with all of the amazing ideas i have for this server, it wont be like any other server i can guaruntee this. Reply and/or PM me your interest in position.
Thanks for your time, Onelife.
