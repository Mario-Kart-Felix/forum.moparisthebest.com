    <title>Donator Points</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/donator-points/521662</link>
    <description>Hi guys, I have my donator shop all set up.  But I&#39;m having problems actually getting the donator points to work.  I made it so I have 10000 donator points, but when I go to the shop (yes I made myself donator) and try to buy an item, it tells me I don&#39;t have enough points to purchase the item.  I&#39;m confused.  I&#39;m also using a PI.  If anybody could give me some help that would be great!</description>
