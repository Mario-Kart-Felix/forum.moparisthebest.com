Yes, they will say exactly the same about the Americans. Scientist nowadays make assumptions based on observable facts and have an exploratory mindset. People who said the earth was flat was just plain ignorant.</p>

<p>Exactly, people thought the world was flat at one point and that was considered a widely known fact, then it was proven wrong once enough evidence against it was found.</p>
