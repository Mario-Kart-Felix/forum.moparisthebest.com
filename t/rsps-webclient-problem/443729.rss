    <title>RSPS Webclient Problem!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-webclient-problem/443729</link>
    <description>I just recently downloaded InsanityX source and client and I went through jar maker following each step carefully. I create the jar file and sign it. But, when i go to run the jar file it just wont open or even attempt to open. I feel as if thats the problem there. But I continue and try to add the file to my website and get a &quot;red x error.&quot; I have the most recent java btw. Anyway I click on it and it says, &quot;cannot execute client.class&quot; and so I click details but that doesn&#39;t help. So I neeeeed to know how to fix this pleeeaaasee!! Thanks So much! PS I did refresh my browser and all that and I did change the server ip I have it portforwarded and I can play the desktop version only.</description>
