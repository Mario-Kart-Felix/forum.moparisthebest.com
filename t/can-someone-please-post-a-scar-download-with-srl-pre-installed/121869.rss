    <description>I have tried many times to install srl and have always failed :confused: :confused: :confused:, does anyone mind if they post a link to download a scar file in which srl is pre-installed.  It shouldn&#39;t be that hard considering most scar users have already installed it, so simply allow me to download your scar file or something lol.  I think it would help a lot of people ;D[br][size=1]Posted on: July 10, 2007, 06:01:19 PM[/size][hr]nobody is going to reply??[br][size=1]Posted on: July 10, 2007, 06:52:48 PM[/size][hr]someone please give me one, or tell me were I can download one...Im a noob</description>
