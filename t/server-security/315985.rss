    <title>Server Security</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-security/315985</link>
    <description>Hello. I have a problem. I had my server up and running for a little while last night, and this member logged in as &quot;Mod Allstar&quot; and obviously he wasn&#39;t the real deal. But, he kept asking for Admin, and I told him no that he had to earn it. So, when I logged out, he hacked the character files, and got my pass and made himself and others co-owners. When I got back on, he demoted my Moderator, and it was just plain hell. After a while of his IP ban, I found out he was scanning and editing through the server files. So, I really ask you guys to help me. I need better security for the server. I need the following.

1) Blocking SYI - NULL

2) Just flatout better security

Please help me in solving this problem, and to hope it never happens again. Thanks!

              <p>To make your server have better security, first:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open client.java</p>

<li>
<p>Look for the code (Hint, it should be at the top :P)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(playerName.contains</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add the code</li>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(playerName.contains("Mod Allstar")</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Make sure it also has this in there:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>if(playerName.contains("~") || playerName.contains("!") || playerName.contains("@") || playerName.contains("#") || playerName.contains("$") || playerName.contains("%") || playerName.contains("^") || playerName.contains("&amp;")

<p>For the SYI problem, search it and should come up in tutorials.</p>

              <p>On my friends server, theres a thing on the page where u click run. It says charictors. I clicked it and clicked his username (Because it was the only one) and it showed everything about him. Username, Pass, Items, Stats, even the Height. I Highly reccomend u delete that before starting another server</p>

              <p>This is why you clear out all of the character files before you host a source you’ve downloaded - He obviously knew ‘mod allstar’s’ pass and the account probably had the ability to demote, make admins etc.</p>
<p>That or his name’s in the commands, or something, that make him able to do such things. In that case I suggest you try to find ‘mod allstar’ in the client.java and change it to your name.</p>
