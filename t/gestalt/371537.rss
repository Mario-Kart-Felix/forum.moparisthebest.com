    <description>well i was looking around to see if what im wanting to create already exist in open-source form. this isnt what im looking for but i think its interesting and thought in would share my findings. its a way to include ironruby, ironpython, and xaml in webpages. i think if someone wanted to spend the time they possibly may be able to create a nice game(or widget/web app) with this. its fast(at least compared to javafx; at least when ive used javafx using one app seemed pretty slow.idky but it was. sometimes though the gestalt examples take a little time to load[a few seconds not longer than a minute].) but easily hackable, i would think if you used it for a game since you could edit it from a development tool that you can get with most web browsers that is if it isnt already included w/ the browser. it kinda seems like a short post but i have to head to bed.

gestalt is a silverlight application. side-note: after seeing this i am interested in silverlight it seems very powerful so i may learn this also. i plan on learning many programming languages anyways and this is one thing that ive found that microsoft has done that i like(havent seen the syntax so idk about that part but from the output and performance its pleasing.</description>

              <p>that looks cool also, i was playing one of the html5 games and it crashed chrome, idk if it was b/c of the browser or what. silverlight is availiable on macs b/c msft made an app for the mac os. i havent tried out moonlight yet so idk how it handles the silverlight apps. kinda on kinda off topic: on flash games like farmville and farmtown, when your system slows down is it because of all the actions going on or is it b/c of poor design? i dont really like those games but my mom and gma plays them and they have pretty big farms with lots of animals and and other entities, and they wonder why when they play that game it locks up the computer(quick spec of pc; 3 gb of ddr3, cpu?[some intel one cant remember]); i think its all the crap they have on the game, but then i thought maybe the game design has problems or the design of flash has a problem. i was also wondering how much programming you need to know to make a flash application, because i read some where that you dont have to have any all you need is adobe flash. so if thats true wouldnt the design of that flash application be poor some what since the only programming logic would be auto-generated? k thanks for the reply.</p>

<p>Silverlight is just a shitty attempt at flash by microsoft, and it is only supported on windows machines, but only if you first install the silverlight plugin.  Novell makes a silverlight plugin for other operating systems based on mono, but it isn’t supported and doesn’t work on everything.</p>

              <p>this isnt what ive been working on its just something i found, what i was working on i had some code put together then was like ya i dont think this will be very good so ive been looking around at examples of similar things im wanting to write. if i believe it what i plan on working on is good enough to show i well but until i get somewhere with it its not really anything to bother people with. but on the topic of gestalt: they have some examples on their site: <a href="http://visitmix.com/labs/gestalt/samples/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://visitmix.com/labs/gestalt/samples/</a> sorry for forgetting to supply a link to that site i was tired. but theres some nice things there and thats just the beginning of what you can do, im sure you can do alot more.</p>
