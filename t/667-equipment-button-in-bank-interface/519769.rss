    <description>[IMG]http://i1199.photobucket.com/albums/aa480/134cb/Glitch.png[/img]

i&#39;ve been trying to fix this for the longest time if you go into the bank click the equipment button to take you to your equipment stats then exit the equipment stats interface then try to bank it locks up everything, i know what the problem is the interface shows &amp; the inventory is set like it is normally when you go to open equipment stat&#39;s;  
anyone know how to remove the equipment button inside the bank or anyone know how to fix this problem or even cheapfix it?

i&#39;d post some stuff but i&#39;m not sure exactally where the problem would be besides buttonhandler or w/e &amp; this is the same on all 667&#39;s &amp; 718s


If anyone can help me with this..i will love you forever. &lt;3 lmao.  ;D</description>
