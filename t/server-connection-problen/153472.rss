    <title>Server Connection Problen</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-connection-problen/153472</link>
    <description>Huff, I can log in to Moparscape but after 30 seconds It says Connection Problem. Trying To Reconnect. 
And then I get logged out and can&#39;t log in again. What has really happend? Because everytime I turn of the program and turn it on again I can play for 30 seconds, after that the same thing happends.

Yes, I have a good connection with everything else.
Yes, I have the newest version of Java.</description>
