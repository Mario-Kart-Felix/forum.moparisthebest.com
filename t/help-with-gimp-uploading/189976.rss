    <title>Help with gimp uploading</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-gimp-uploading/189976</link>
    <description>Hey Guys, I made something in GIMP, but idk how to upload it. Everytime I try to do it in photobucket it doesn&#39;t work.
if anyone could tell me how, I&#39;d really appreciate it.
Everytime I save it as some type of file, it saves as a .XCF</description>

<p>go to file&gt;save as&gt;enter the name u want to save it as&gt;click select by file type (by extension)&gt;Scrool down and search for PNG Image (it should be like 21 down). then hit save. Now just go to your uploader and upload it. I use photobucket. but you can use anything you want</p>
