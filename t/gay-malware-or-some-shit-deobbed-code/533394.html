<p>well i was browsing his site and saw the beta client for pokenation, and i was going to take a look at the source to see how it was done etc etc.</p>
<p>i accidentally ran it due to crap computer keyboard buttons, but oh well.</p>
<p>well, at first google chrome stopped loading up any pages i tried to load. it constantly displayed the loading circle and that’s it. then i noticed that no page would load at all . not even chrome:// pages, like settings or about. this is where i knew something was wrong.</p>
<p>i tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and as soon as the install finished, i got a balloon notification in the tray area saying google settings have crashed.</p>
<p>i tried a scan with malware bytes, nothing was found. i checked my registry with ccleaner and nothing noticeable was messed up. i am now running a scan with spybot s&amp;d.</p>

<p>if anyone can figure out what this jar is doing, or how to fix my browser. i will greatly appreciate it.</p>
