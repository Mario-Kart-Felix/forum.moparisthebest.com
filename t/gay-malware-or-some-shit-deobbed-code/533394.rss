    <description>well. many of you who actually visit r-s may know who xaves is, and what he&#39;s known for...

well i was browsing his site and saw the beta client for pokenation, and i was going to take a look at the source to see how it was done etc etc.

i accidentally ran it due to crap computer keyboard buttons, but oh well.

well, at first google chrome stopped loading up any pages i tried to load. it constantly displayed the loading circle and that&#39;s it. then i noticed that no page would load at all . not even chrome:// pages, like settings or about. this is where i knew something was wrong.

i tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and as soon as the install finished, i got a balloon notification in the tray area saying google settings have crashed.

i tried a scan with malware bytes, nothing was found. i checked my registry with ccleaner and nothing noticeable was messed up. i am now running a scan with spybot s&amp;d.


[size=22pt][url=https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z0c5vjfgg2gjy26/DsxyzGO3c_/Pokenation.jar]this will mess up your internet, do not run it. only download if you know what you&#39;re doing.[/url][/size]


if anyone can figure out what this jar is doing, or how to fix my browser. i will greatly appreciate it.

[size=36pt]again do not run that file[/size]</description>
