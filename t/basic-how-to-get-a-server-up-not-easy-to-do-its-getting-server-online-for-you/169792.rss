    <title>Basic. How to get a server up. NOT EASY TO DO. Its getting server online for you</title>

    <description>First download JDK update 6u3 The latest version.
Then download a source.
then it should come up in Win.Rar if you have it.
Then right click&gt;select all. And extract to your My documents. Then you can run the server from there. But not everyone can get on it. Port forward, then put the CLASSPATH and PATH into the firewall thing to make your computer reconise the java. Then other people should be able to get onto the server. 

IF THIS DOESN&#39;T HELP YOU MUCH. DONT SPAM ABOUT IT. ONLY POSITIVE COMMENTS IF IT DID HELP YOU!

THIS WOULD HELP A LOT FOR PEOPLE THAT DONT UNDERSTAND OTHER TUTS. 

THIS I MADE UP MYSELF. AT LEAST I DIDNT LEECH IT...



I DONT EXPECT EVERYONE TO SAY IM AWESOME. JUST POSITIVE COMMENTS ONLY PLEASE</description>
