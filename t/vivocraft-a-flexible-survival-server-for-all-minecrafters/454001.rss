    <title>VivoCraft- A flexible survival server for all minecrafters</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vivocraft-a-flexible-survival-server-for-all-minecrafters/454001</link>
    <description>Hi! I&#39;m rwjfan555, owner of Vivo-Craft. The staff and I make our best attempts to make this server fun to play on. Our server is hosted on Microsoft&#39;s servers, so it&#39;s going to fail all the time. Kidding! The server runs REALLY nicely, almost no lag at all. But, the most important thing is:



IP Address: 173.240.50.139:25565
Join now!

Q&#39;s and A&#39;s:

Is this 1.5.2?
Yes!

What does the server look like?
[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=_le9A6OCyu4[/youtube]
What plugins are there?
Various plugins are installed, most for anti-grief measures, others for fun. BOSEconomy and ChestShop are two economy plugins. TimTheEnchanter is installed, although the latest upgrade broke it a little (you can&#39;t do /enchant none anymore). CoreProtect is installed for admins to investigate who griefed what. WorldEdit is installed because it makes everything sexy, and, of course, it is a Bukkit server, so if there is a Bukkit plugin that you want, ask nicely and we may install it for you. Notable plugins list: Essentials, Worldedit, Worldguard, SafeCreepers, McMMO. The full list of plugins can always be found with a server query.

What are members allowed to do?
Members can use essentials to set an unlimited number of private warps called homes, teleport back to their previous locations on death, and generally use survival in a modified way. The jobs plugin and McMMO enhance actions used by the player to help newer users out.

Does this server use Votifier?
Yes, Votifier allows people who vote on minecraftserverlist to get 7 diamonds, even if they aren&#39;t online at the time.

Who all is the staff?
Staff includes: Rayshawn, Classified39, sergig4925, rwjfan555. etizo helps out on ocassion.

What if you didn&#39;t answer my question?
Join and ask anyone with an [Admin], [HeadMod], or [Owner] tag in front of their name. Or just post below!



Join today and have fun!
