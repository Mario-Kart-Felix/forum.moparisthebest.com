<p>Wikipedia definition:</p>
<blockquote>Brain death is a legal indicator of death in the USA that refers to the irreversible end of all brain activity (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life) due to total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of blood flow and oxygenation. Brain-stem death (not whole brain death) is taken to be the significant indicator of death. The significant point is that the brain is no longer capable of sustaining the rest of the body's systems without advanced life support. It should not be confused with a persistent vegetative state. The concept of brain death emerged in the 1960s, as the ability to resuscitate individuals and mechanically keep the heart and lungs functioning became prevalent.</blockquote> In other words, a perfectly functioning body with perfectly functioning organs with a seemingly unresponsive brain (determined after only a couple of hours...).
<p>I personally believe it’s a bullshit excuse to discontinue life support and harvest the organs while they’re fresh. There have been countless cases of people who have been declared “brain-dead”, yet awake from their coma (or whatever other vegetative state) with functional brain response after a short period of time.</p>
<p>Here are a few of many, many stories indicating this:<br>

etc.</p>
<p>In class, people mentioned that there have been cases of women declared “brain-dead” giving birth while in that state. If they’re dead, how the hell is that possible? Also, in order to remove all organs from the body, the procedure is preceded by anesthetic treatment - if the brain is dead, and the nerves of the body are dead, why is it that we sedate the so-called dead patients before performing this procedure?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>ps. Don’t turn this into another religion thread as this is a medical/scientific debate.</p>

        <p>At both replies above, you can declare someone dead when their organs stop responding to life support. Another fact against brain death: if one is supposedly dead when the brain is unresponsive, then how is it that a ventilator makes their body function normally, whereas when applied to a corpse, the result is nothing.</p>

There is a difference between hooking a pacemaker and a ventilator up to a corpse, and someone “dying” while on it. The heart, for instance, does not require a functioning brain in order to beat.[/quote]I’m obviously not medically trained either, but this guy is:<br>
<a href="http://www.cfnews.org/ByrneInterview.htm" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.cfnews.org/ByrneInterview.htm</a></p>
<p>Look at his final answer:</p>
<blockquote>Dr. Byrne: If there is any question in the mind of your readers as to the fact that “brain death” is not true death, perhaps they may want to ask themselves the following questions regarding “brain death” and vital organ transplantation:
<p>·    Why can health insurance cover intensive care costs on “brain dead” patients?<br>
·    Why do “brain dead” patients often receive intravenous fluids, antibiotics, ventilator care, and other life support measures?<br>
·    Is it right and just for physicians and “designated requesters” to tell families that their “brain-dead” loved one is dead when she or he is not dead?<br>
·    <span class="bbcode-b">How can “brain dead” patients have normal body functions, including vital signs, if they are really dead?</span><br>
·    How can a “brain-dead” pregnant mother deliver a normal, healthy infant?<br>
·    <span class="bbcode-b">Why does a ventilator work on someone declared “brain dead,” but not on a corpse?</span><br>
·    Why is it wrong to carry out the burial or cremation of a “brain-dead” person?<br>
·    Are persons who have been declared “brain dead” truly dead?<br>
·    If “brain-dead” persons are not truly dead, are they alive?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>edit: By the way, does a pacemaker actually work under a non-beating heart? Or does it require that the heart continue to beat in order to regulate the BPM?</p>
<p>edit2: </p><blockquote>[size=15pt]To be on life support the patient must still be alive.[/size]</blockquote>

<p>depends what you mean by a non beating heart? no you cant stick one on a dead persons heart and have it beat, but thats because thats not how heartbeat works - as i understand it the heart keeps itself beating, unless its damaged or there is an arrythmia that prevents it from beating properly, which is what a pacemaker does by regulating the impulses that time the beats</p>

<p>edit: i guess what im trying to say is that the medulla/brain stem doesnt make the heart pump, it regulates the beat[/quote]I don’t actually see the relevance between the heart’s lack of dependability on the brain and this topic, as I was never insinuating that I doubted the veracity of someone actually being “brain-dead”, I just said that I don’t believe it to be a proper measure for declaring someone dead. As I said before as well, the testing for brain death is also highly inaccurate, so who knows how many people have been misdiagnosed.</p>

It is actual murder, by definition, if someone declares another person dead and removes the only thing that was keeping them alive, when in fact they could have recuperated.</p>
<p>Think of this scenario: “Oh, because patients who come in with a heart attack usually don’t make it, we shouldn’t bother pumping their heart back into action through CPR, and instead just let them die.” (assuming the patient isn’t DNR obv); a valid analogy to what you are suggesting to be the foundation on which the whole concept of being “brain dead” equates to being legally dead.</p>

<p>I used it as an example, I didn’t actually mean statistic wise, but I’m sure there are better analogies that are applicable.</p>
<p>When I say “brain-dead”, I mean that the patient was declared “brain-dead” by his/her doctor. The thing becomes, of course, how accurate are these tests? Can they absolutely guarantee that this patient will not regain brain activity EVER? Obviously not.</p>
<p>And I say you can draw the line whenever a ventilator ceases to work on the patient. (Again, I don’t know the specifics involved, but there comes a point when a ventilator just doesn’t cut it)</p>

<p>A doctor would never just say someone was “brain dead”. This is my point, “brain dead” can mean multiple things.</p>
<p>I’m not aware of anybody who was totally brain dead recovering. If you have no brain activity… you’re dead. Gone. If there’s any sources that state the contrary, I’d love to read them (no sarcasm, I’m just a massive nerd).</p>
<p>As for how accurate the tests are, I assume they can read it from an EEG. Pretty precise <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>EDIT: re: the ventilator thing - what does “work” mean. ventilators just inflate the lungs, they “work” on a dead guy I assume.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I’ve never heard of someone being declared brain dead without the doctor referring to complete lack of brain activity (not minimal, but none).</p>
<p>The first two links in my original post are cases of people who have been declared brain dead, yet have regained consciousness shortly after.</p>
<p>ps. the second link story with more detail: <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/23775873/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/23775873/</a></p>
