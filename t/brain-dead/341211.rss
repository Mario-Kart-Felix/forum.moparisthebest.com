    <title>Brain dead</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/brain-dead/341211</link>
    <description>We were debating this issue in school a while ago, and an interesting discussion came about.

Wikipedia definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Brain death is a legal indicator of death in the USA that refers to the irreversible end of all brain activity (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life) due to total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of blood flow and oxygenation. Brain-stem death (not whole brain death) is taken to be the significant indicator of death. The significant point is that the brain is no longer capable of sustaining the rest of the body&#39;s systems without advanced life support. It should not be confused with a persistent vegetative state. The concept of brain death emerged in the 1960s, as the ability to resuscitate individuals and mechanically keep the heart and lungs functioning became prevalent.&lt;/blockquote&gt; In other words, a perfectly functioning body with perfectly functioning organs with a seemingly unresponsive brain (determined after only a couple of hours...).

I personally believe it&#39;s a bullshit excuse to discontinue life support and harvest the organs while they&#39;re fresh. There have been countless cases of people who have been declared &quot;brain-dead&quot;, yet awake from their coma (or whatever other vegetative state) with functional brain response after a short period of time.

Here are a few of many, many stories indicating this:
http://www.startribune.com/local/east/15545747.html
http://www.theinsider.com/news/751481__Brain_Dead_Man_Wakes_Up_Goes_on_Today_Show
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-404832/Brain-damaged-patients-wake-following-sleeping-pill-treatment.html
http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2006/sep/12/health.healthandwellbeing
etc.

In class, people mentioned that there have been cases of women declared &quot;brain-dead&quot; giving birth while in that state. If they&#39;re dead, how the hell is that possible? Also, in order to remove all organs from the body, the procedure is preceded by anesthetic treatment - if the brain is dead, and the nerves of the body are dead, why is it that we sedate the so-called dead patients before performing this procedure?

What do you think?

ps. Don&#39;t turn this into another religion thread as this is a medical/scientific debate.</description>

              <p>i see your point, and i’m not entirely sure why they would make these facts up but they sound like complete bullshit.</p>
<p>some are likely to have been misinterpreted either by the scientists or people relaying the information (like you). the one about someone coming back to life after having their blood drained for 30 mins is obviously wrong, because none of the cells in their body would be able to respire and would die very shortly. but the body might have appeared living for a while because of muscle twitches etc.</p>
<p>the one about being able to live after having your head cut off may have an element of truth in it, it just depends on how much of the head has been cut off. if their brain stem has been preserved and their major arteries+veins are still being emulated, then they may appear living.</p>

              <p>because back when Hitler’s scientists did tests they really did them hardcore and i believe it because its documented anyways and they were scientists after all right, todays scientists are too soft doing tests on lab rats and shit. Lol that animated headless stuff was really cool. If anyone donated their head to science it should be attempted maybe possibly recreated :P. It’s not Frankenstein here we are not sowing together a few different body parts and spazzing it with electricity.</p>
<p>All these nazi scientists did is just taking apart a human body then connecting it back together without the covering and you don’t need to connect every wire for something to work only the important ones count, should make it partially functioning.</p>

orite i didn’t really read links and quotes in detail.</p>
<p>yeah, i think that if the persons brain is not functioning (specifically the cerebrum), then the person will not be experiencing ‘human’ life and it’s a complete waste of resources taking care of them. those resources could be used to help people who are suffering, not just to keep someone going like they’re an old machine.</p>
<p>i realise there is a chance the person could come back, but as i’ve just stated, it’d be a waste of money. of course, if some rich fucker is paying for private healthcare that’d be a different matter…</p>

<p>as yakman said, nobody can precisely define life and the same goes for death. it’s the cerebrum which gives us high level thinking, and makes us and other animals seem intelligent. if the brain is dead and the rest of the body is somehow functioning, we don’t have high level thinking - therefore we don’t feel pain or any of the other factors associated with living (from the patients point of view).</p>
<p>we only stay alive because the spinal cord and other nervous systems are unaffected, but these can only perform basic tasks based on strict ‘rules’. if you view simple input/process/output as life, then you could say a computer is living because it can respond to inputs in the same logical way.[/quote]</p>
<p>You can’t do it on a case by case basis, that’s stupid. Or rather, it IS done on a case by case basis, and what we are discussing is the guidelines.</p>
<p>When you said “its the cerebrum that gives us high level thinking” etc., you seem to be implying that with a cerebrum and no brain stem we can live? We can’t. You don’t survive without a brain stem.</p>
