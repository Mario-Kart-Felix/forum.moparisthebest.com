    <description>I really don&#39;t know what to do next, its late my brain ain&#39;t working.

So i made this void that has randoms. [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,205658.0.html]http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,205658.0.html[/url]

Thanks to newb 2341 Its fixed.

I logged in on a test account and i got either one. But then i thought of something, any person with a decent size intelligence would figure, &quot;hey if i keep logging in what are the chances that i don&#39;t even have to train?&quot;

Lets say you get no levels trained, and you have to train. He would just log out, and he would have a better chance of getting his skills trained, only costs him about 16 seconds or less.

So what am i supposed to do to stop this?

i made some ints because i was thinking of something, then i lost it...i was thinking of something under the process..but idk anymore.

public int fullLevels = 0;
public int noLevels = 0;
public int hardLevel = 0;
public int easyLevels = 0;

So what should i do so the person, that has already logged in and received their levels, either it be none, just one, or all, not getting other levels if they log back out and back in?</description>

<p>so you want it so if you reach a skill in 99, it disables allowing that player to get the random pretty much?</p>

</aside>
<p>Kinda yeah. If you were suppose to get 99 range and you got it. I want the client to remember that you got that random and cannot get anymore randoms if you log in &amp; back out, thus i have those ints. But idk what to do with them. &lt;-- Refer To Thread Title.</p>
<p>EDIT: I got a brain orgasm!</p>
<p>What if i put at the beginning of the each random</p>
<p>if(misc.random(3) == 1 &amp;&amp; easyLevel = 0 &amp;&amp; hardLevel = 0 &amp;&amp; noLevel = 0) {</p>
<p>/* But do i add the ; after the ints? */</p>

<p>if so, try using somthing to read players stats, so if it checks stats 0-6 and tehy have above lets say 1mil exp, they are removed from the random lookings</p>
