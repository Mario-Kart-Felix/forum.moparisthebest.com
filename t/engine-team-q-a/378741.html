<p>[quote="“Mod Dowd and other JMods”"]Hi all,</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I asked you to submit some questions that you have been dying to ask our Engine team.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone that submitted a question.</p>
<p>I am now happy to tell you that the Engine team have found time to answer your questions and have sent them back to me! It really is a fantastic read so be sure to check them all out.</p>
<p>I have done my best to divide the questions up into categories, and done a bit of formatting.</p>
<p>There are 4 parts, so here is part 1, “Questions about the Engine!”…</p>
<p>Part 2 “Future Changes” coming soon.</p>
<p>Questions about the Engine!</p>
<p>Q. About how many lines of code is the critical part of the system? I remember a long time ago that Andrew said there were over a million lines of code altogether, but I’m curious to see how many lines exist to run the core of the game.</p>
<p>A. The engine and libraries are in the hundreds of thousands of lines of code. The game content that sits on top of this is millions of lines (which is what Andrew has previously talked about).<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. What operating systems take precedence for support, and which do you elect not to support?</p>
<p>A. We support as much as possible though in the case of Linux we use Ubuntu and only really work with the latest version of it due to Linux updating so often. The lowest Windows and Mac versions we currently support are 2000 and 10.4 (respectively) as anything lower than these are practically impossible to support now.<br>
Mod_noldor</p>
<p>Q. A lot of flak gets thrown your way when the game overall suffers from critical bugs. It’s happened in the past, but what steps/tests do you do to ensure that the game’s engine is rock solid?</p>
<p>A. We take as much care as possible that any of the changes to the engine will not disrupt the players gaming experience. Once a change has been made it gets put into the testing environment. Depending on the change we then test along with game content and, if needed, run it through compatibility testing (this consists of 15 different hardware setups with up to 20 software setups on each). This is a mixture of the most popular and most problematic hardware / software so we get a good mix. Even with the above it can take 3 to 4 days to test a single change. Once checked the engine changes then get moved to our RC (Release Candidate) environment and retested including another round of (reduced) compatibility testing. This is to make sure that there wasn’t something in the WIP (work in progress) environment that could have been impacting the changes. Only when we are happy with the changes do we then let it go live.<br>
Mod_noldor</p>
<p>Q. What is your IDE of choice? If you can’t reveal that, what colour scheme do you prefer - dark background/light text, light background/dark text, or something in between?</p>
<p>A. We use Eclipse for Java, Visual Studio for C++ and our own editor for the script language.<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. Why do you put a limit on the amount of bank space we can have?</p>
<p>A. There are technical limitations when it comes to saving the data on the server – remember that we have close to 200 million accounts with data saved, therefore some limitations are needed. Managing your bank has since become part of the everyday experience in RuneScape and we won’t take that away but we are always open for additional ideas as to store items.<br>
Mod_fetzky</p>
<p>Q. Well I’ve got a fairly simple question…why Java?</p>
<p>A. Java has been a great language for RuneScape to grow up with. We are now starting to mix in other languages though and in the long term we may move away from Java entirely.<br>
Mod_nick</p>
<p>Q. I’ve always wondered, what are the technical advantages to using Java?</p>
<p>A. Java does provide certain securities and useful features that most other languages do not, so in some ways it is an asset to use it but we don’t use Java exclusively.<br>
Mod_michael</p>
<p>Q. How many elements of the engine are written in Java, and how many are<br>
written in a faster language (say C or C++)? How many would be scripted?</p>
<p>A. In the engine, the Java/C++ split is probably around 95/5, although it depends on the graphics mode you are using. The scripting dwarves the engine code in length!<br>
mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. I’ve heard that there’s a combination of Java and C++ to form the ‘backbone’ of the game, what exactly is coded in java and what parts of the game use C++?</p>
<p>A. The game itself is coded using RuneScript which is our own scripting language. The game engine uses Java for almost everything except for rendering (drawing the scene to the screen)<br>
Mod_nick</p>
<p>Q. Why not write the engine in C, and use Java as a wrapper to convey it via webpage’s?</p>
<p>A. Because it is already written in Java. This might sound a little backwards, but when you have a huge legacy engine to maintain, porting it all to C is a rather serious job to undertake. If we were to develop a new engine from scratch, we might take a different approach to the one taken 10 years ago.<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. Are there any plans to upgrade the game to 64-Bit Java seeing as this would allow for many more improvements to the game?</p>
<p>A. Our game servers already run under 64bit Java. You can already run the client under 64 bit Java too, if you like, but it’s both slower and less stable as Sun/Oracle still have some work to do on the client compiler.<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. Is Java a efficient platform for games?? Is running on Java platform makes the programming more complex and inefficient to make a decent game?</p>
<p>A. Java is a nice language to code in, and means we can run on different computers without much trouble. The problem with it is that it’s harder to take full advantage of the hardware available on Java, which is why the game engine incorporates native (C++) code to talk straight to the hardware.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. Why RS is a browser applet, instead of using Java Web Start?</p>
<p>A. Web start didn’t exist when RuneScape was created. I can’t really see any benefits to switching to it now that we’re established as an applet.<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. (More related to web systems) What programming language are the forums coded in, and what is the .ws extension on all the pages of the site, I’ve never seen it before!</p>
<p>A. .ws is our own webscript format, it is a mixture of HTML with server-side active elements which compile to Java code using our own webscript compiler. All of our web modules (including the main web sites, game worlds and all the supporting modules) use this format for their web pages.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. Do you guys interact with the content developers a lot to update the game engine and to make their projects possible, or do you have your own ‘to do list’ of things to add to the engine that the content guys can then take advantage of in their projects as you create them?</p>
<p>A. We do a mixture of improvements to the game engine according to our own plans for its future, and changes to help the content team with what they want to do. There is much cross-over between these two work streams.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. What does it take to create all the code to maintain and run a game the size of Runescape?</p>
<p>A. A lot of hard work, a lot of time and a lot of fun!<br>
Mod_nick</p>
<p>Q. I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but could you possibly go into a little detail as to what we can do with the drop down developer’s console?</p>
<p>A. The developer console currently only has a limited number of commands available to players, which you can see a list of by typing ‘commands’ into the console. These are aimed at giving you access to information which can help us to solve issues with RuneScape. Internally, there are many more commands which are accessible only to J-mods – for instance, we can give ourselves objects and teleport to anywhere in the game from the dev console.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. What happened to the skyboxes?</p>
<p>A. I am going to be working on an improvement to their code in the next week or so. They are available for use in RuneScape, as and when the content guys find a use for them in their fiendish schemes!<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. Why not use less polygons and more textures for the scenery for a higher game speed? (IE the Lumbridge castle walls, the bridge to the Wizards tower)</p>
<p>A. Because the software renderers (both Java and SSE) are faster at rendering lots of small untextured triangles than large textured ones (because of the memory access that texturing requires). Again, newer games or engines may not have this restriction.<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. Have you guys ever checked out some of the NeHe openGL tutorials for some new cool special effects you could use?</p>
<p>A. The NeHe OpenGL tutorials are a great place to look if you are learning graphical techniques but for us it is not a matter of learning the techniques, it is a matter of restructuring parts of the game engine to allow us to use them (without slowing down your frame rate). This is the work that we are currently undertaking.<br>
Mod_nick</p>
<p>Q. Any plans of incorporating other rendering engines, such as the 3Impact engine?</p>
<p>A. Our whole engine is very carefully crafted to give us advantages like low bandwidth and small download for instance. It would not be possible to incorporate third party render engines without losing those advantages.<br>
Mod_nick</p>
<p>Q. What’s the status update on hs_err log problems?</p>
<p>A. This issue has been looked into and from the information we have managed to get appears to be a bug with the Java applet although we continue to look into a work around for it.<br>
Mod_noldor</p>
<p>Q. Is there any chance Runescript (I think that is what it’s called… not 100% positive though) will be released to the public so they can learn how to use it?</p>
<p>A. We do not plan to release it in the near future but we are thinking around whether this could be possible one day.<br>
Mod_nick</p>
<p>Q. When are the rest of RT5’s capabilities being released?</p>
<p>A. This is down to the content team, who use technical capabilities as and when they need them.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. I’m not being silly but does the engine team have anything to do with the forums? If not, what team is it?</p>
<p>A. Web systems maintain the forums, along with all our other web site code.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p><em>Cough</em> let’s not forgot the Community Management team who spend a vast majority of our time on the forums interacting with the community!<br>
Mod Dowd</p>
<p>Q. How long does an average update take you guys to do? Example: Design and Audio team gives you an item to update to the engine, do you have meetings with the rest of the engine team or you all talk to each other?</p>
<p>A. We all sit in the same area and tend to just roll our chairs into a circle and have a chat if there’s something non-trivial that needs deciding on. Formal meetings do happen now and again if there’s lots to talk about or if it’s something that two people have conflicting viewpoints on, to avoid annoying our office-mates too much!<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. How do particles work in software mode?</p>
<p>A. Particles are handled by a system that sits above the graphics modes and calls into them to render the particles, so they work in software mode the same as in all other modes. Essentially we have emitters which squirt out particles, and effectors which either suck them in or repel them. Emitters and effectors can be attached to models. This allows a wide range of effects to be created.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. Does PID exist? If so, what benefits does a low PID bring to a player?</p>
<p>A. When the server processes players, it goes through them each in turn. If you are first in the list, you get processed first. In early versions of Classic, you always got put at the end of the list (if I remember rightly), so if you stayed logged in you would end up at the beginning of the list eventually. Being processed first meant you could catch up with people more easily when following them, which gave an advantage particularly in the wilderness with PVP. A low PID means you were at the beginning of the list, high PIDs were at the end.<br>
This is no longer true, as you are now placed in a random place in the list and everyone else is shuffled up, so you don’t retain the same PID throughout your session. This makes things much fairer.<br>
mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. Apparently people are using modified RS clients to be able to view their PID, and so they can log in and out until they get what they desire. Are you planning to do anything about this or how PIDs are assigned?</p>
<p>A. Whilst it may be possible to extract this with a modified client right now, we are working on updates which will make your slot in the server more or less irrelevant when it comes to action timing.<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. Is there any restriction in the hardware resource utilisation in RS, such as for the memory usage, you can manually adjust the maximum usage, so is the restriction just because of its low default setting, or there is a real restriction?</p>
<p>A. Some versions of Java severely restrict the memory we have access to. This is a good reason to upgrade your Java to the latest version. However, if your Java version allows access to more memory, the game will take advantage of that.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. Many games with better graphics quality than RS can play more smoothly and thus better gaming experience, but will be more laggy when playing RS on the same system spec</p>
<p>A. I suspect many of these do not have game engines dating back 6-10 years! The computer and internet world was very different back in 2003 when RS2 was coded, so many of the things that we do now in the engine we would do differently if starting again. That said, a large portion of our time in the engine team is spent in taking parts of the engine, stripping them right back and then re-implementing them with a more modern approach, often with the benefit of hindsight. In this way we are always catching up with newer engines, but I am sure that you can understand that this is a big task!<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>A. Can you disclose more technical details about the game engine? Such as what parts of DirectX and OpenGL is being utilised and what version is being used?</p>
<p>A. We target DirectX 9 and OpenGL 1.4 at the moment.<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. How far can Runescape be developed to like the other mainstream games? I mean what features that are commonly seen in other games and are seen as essential can be introduced into RuneScape?</p>
<p>A. In a world with plentiful development time (and no live game to support!) we could match or exceed any other commercial game out there – we are not limited by anything other than time. Supporting millions of players take a surprising amount of maintenance time from everyone in the company!<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. Is the computer specs of most players that low that Jagex have to develop RuneScape into simpler and less demanding game intentionally? Can’t you develop some breathtaking scene such as complex trees and geographical features? Like keeping the client small in file size, I’m sure most players have broadband and I am sure there are many ways to increase the client download bandwith, so I would suggest not keeping the texture of RS that simple.</p>
<p>A. Keeping the client download size small means people get into game quicker, which we’ve found is very important to most players. It also reduces our bandwidth costs, which means we can offer subscription at a much lower rate than most online games, even the ones which have a CD/DVD you have to install on your computer first.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>And yes, the average specification for our players are very low indeed (for example, around 28% of our players have CPUs under 2Ghz, and around 23% have under 1GB of RAM).<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. In the GE and other crowded places the FPS rate is like 10. CPU usage is 25% (quadcore AMD Phenom 2.4Ghz) and GPU (HD4650) usage is about 20%.</p>
<p>Are you using the CPU for some graphical renderings even in the HD mode, where the GPU is available? If yes, why, and do you have plans to move everything graphical to the GPU?</p>
<p>A. In short, yes and yes. Mostly the animation system, and for, again, legacy reasons.<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. Is there going to be an in-game option for anisotropic filtering?</p>
<p>A. Maybe, it just requires some time to implement it. With our given market’s PC specifications, it would be a very niche upgrade.<br>
Mod_chris_e</p>
<p>Q. I’ve noticed water in the game isn’t exactly great, is there any reason the water is rendered like this? Or is it actually how you wanted it?</p>
<p>A. Well, it’s certainly a lot better than we used to have! But we would definitely like to improve it further.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. As we know and stated by Andrew the game runs at 600ms intervals (one tick). Is there a reason for this exact number? Could the game benefit from lower interval, for example 300ms?</p>
<p>A. Some upcoming features in the server tick at a 50ms rate. The overall 600ms tick remains, as the content relies on having this time interval available as a base, but we’re not limited by it.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. What is the single biggest non-hardware based challenge you face? (i.e. not computer diversity) Memory limits?</p>
<p>A. Memory is certainly an important limit. The need to support old versions of Java is also quite a challenge. So if you haven’t already, please, upgrade your Java to the latest version – it’s free and will make our lives much easier!<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. What’s been the most challenging update that you have faced regarding the Game Engine?</p>
<p>A. The most challenging ones for me have been changes to the graphics system – every change we make there has to be done in safe mode, software mode, OpenGL and DirectX so it’s a lot of work.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. Does the game use TCP or UDP for packets?</p>
<p>A. Both – our internal communications between worlds and modules are all UDP, while the game talks to your PC using TCP.<br>
Mod_jackh</p>
<p>Q. Are the DirectX and OpenGL modes visually same? There have been some rumours that DirectX is less detailed than OpenGL.</p>
<p>A. In theory, they should be identical, except where GL and DirectX differ in an implementation of something. There is nothing we do to limit detail in one versus the other.<br>

        <blockquote>Q. Does PID exist? If so, what benefits does a low PID bring to a player?
<p>A. When the server processes players, it goes through them each in turn. If you are first in the list, you get processed first. In early versions of Classic, you always got put at the end of the list (if I remember rightly), so if you stayed logged in you would end up at the beginning of the list eventually. Being processed first meant you could catch up with people more easily when following them, which gave an advantage particularly in the wilderness with PVP. A low PID means you were at the beginning of the list, high PIDs were at the end.<br>
This is no longer true, as you are now placed in a random place in the list and everyone else is shuffled up, so you don’t retain the same PID throughout your session. This makes things much fairer.<br>

</aside>
<p>Yea, I noticed that throughout this whole thing.  References to IDEs, a lot of comparing of Java and C/C++, they discuss Java Web Start, they seem to know of some of the differences between 32 bit and 64 bit, and they even mention the NeHe openGL tutorials.  There really only seems to be a few questions that look like they were asked by the average player.</p>
<p>The part that really caught my eye was, however</p>
<blockquote>Q. Is there any chance Runescript (I think that is what it's called... not 100% positive though) will be released to the public so they can learn how to use it? 
<p>A. We do not plan to release it in the near future but we are thinking around whether this could be possible one day.</p>
</blockquote><br>
It would be interesting if they ever actually do release it.

<p>Well the ID does not matter anymore? They mentioned how it what it did and how it worked. Just wondering how much of an effect it actually had in the RSC scene. How much of an advantage did a player have with UID 100 compared to an user with UID with 800? That is why I found it interesting as I never knew it made players walk faster. Only thought it allowed for players to hit more accurate.</p>

<p>That’s what I thought they meant, but since when did they have that in runescape?</p>

Had this discussion today with Speljohan. I’m of the opinion that they should bite the bullet and start reimplementing their entire game engine, he doesn’t see the problem with their continued use of legacy code.</p>
<p>I suppose they need to ask themselves if they want to be around in 5 to 10 years time, because if they do then it’s worth their while to redo the engine from the ground up rather than partial rewrites.

<p>Also, there isn’t that much value in them releasing Runescript. There are already a whole bunch of popular scripting languages out there, and it’s bound to similar to one of them.</p>

I disagree I think they should stick to the Java language as they could be the first to expand a mmorpg to the mobile market with little to no massive rewrites. The game engine requires minimal specs and with the new phones and tablets coming out it will only be a matter of time.</p>

<ol>
<li>No free to play mmorpg is even close to competing with it as they are all pretty poorly designed.</li>
<li>It does not compete with the general MMORPG-market due to its game mechanics being vastly different from your typical cookie-cutter game <em>cough</em> WoW <em>cough</em>
