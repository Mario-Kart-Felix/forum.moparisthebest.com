    <description>How do you think life is played out, many think its just a game you play and your action plan out how you end up. But to me its not just your action but the actions of others around you. So anyways here are some things I was told after asking a few people I know.
[hr]
&quot;Life is random as long as you go with the flo your fine.&quot;
[hr]
&quot;They things you do determine how you end up when you grow up, if you think crappy you will be crappy, and vise versa&quot;
[hr]
&quot;You life is determined by who you hang out with, if the people you are with are druggies/dumbasses you will in turn be one&quot;
[hr]
&quot;Life is just for fun nothing else matters&quot;
[hr]
&quot;Live life as a kid, not worry about anything until your 30&quot;
[hr]
&quot;Who cares your only young once just have fun and enjoy&quot;
[hr]

How do you think your future is planned out? or if you think it is. Do you believe hard work is best? or just doing something you love.</description>

<p>Your life changes by how you act. It doesn’t matter how others around you act, since it’s up to YOU to make the right decisions. If there are peers who try to pressure you into doing something stupid, that’s your fault for being sucked into another dumbass’s world. But I think you should live having fun and doing what you enjoy. Chances are, you can benefit others and get paid by doing what you love, like I really enjoy programming and that pays good and aids others and even myself. If not, well, then you’re just living a life of fun.</p>

              <p>Your life changes by how you act. It doesn’t matter how others around you act, since it’s up to YOU to make the right decisions. If there are peers who try to pressure you into doing something stupid, that’s your fault for being sucked into another dumbass’s world. But I think you should live having fun and doing what you enjoy. Chances are, you can benefit others and get paid by doing what you love, like I really enjoy programming and that pays good and aids others and even myself. If not, well, then you’re just living a life of fun.</p>

              <p>How do you think life is played out, many think its just a game you play and your action plan out how you end up. But to me its not just your action but the actions of others around you. So anyways here are some things I was told after asking a few people I know.<br>
[hr]<br>
“Life is random as long as you go with the flo your fine.”<br>
[hr]<br>
“They things you do determine how you end up when you grow up, if you think crappy you will be crappy, and vise versa”<br>
[hr]<br>
“You life is determined by who you hang out with, if the people you are with are druggies/dumbasses you will in turn be one”<br>
[hr]<br>
“Life is just for fun nothing else matters”<br>
[hr]<br>
“Live life as a kid, not worry about anything until your 30”<br>
[hr]<br>
“Who cares your only young once just have fun and enjoy”<br>
[hr]</p>
<p>How do you think your future is planned out? or if you think it is. Do you believe hard work is best? or just doing something you love.</p>
