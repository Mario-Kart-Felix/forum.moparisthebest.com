    <title>Ladders making people crash</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ladders-making-people-crash/397913</link>
    <description>My ladders seem to be making people crash (PI)
People click a ladder, and it comes up with a loading screen forcing them to restart their client, after they rejoin they appear where they wanted to go. Anyone know of a fix? I searched for a while but no luck.

[code]		case 4494:
			if (c.heightLevel == 2) {
				c.getPA().movePlayer(c.absX - 5, c.absY, 1);
			} else if (c.heightLevel == 1) {
				c.getPA().movePlayer(c.absX + 5, c.absY, 0);
			}
		break;[/code]</description>
