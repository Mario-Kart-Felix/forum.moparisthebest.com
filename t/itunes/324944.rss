<p>Careful with these as LloydsTSB tried charging me £98 for being overdrawn £4 for 5 days</p>

The iPod itself shouldn’t carry account authentication credentials, so don’t worry about that. It’s probably a flaw in the system if it’s letting you spend more than what you have available on the visa card, or maybe the visa card source is being charged? Like say your mum bought the card for you, maybe she did something wrong and she will be charged any amount over the $15 monthly.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 10, 2010, 12:58:28 pm[/size][hr][quote author=eczema3 link=topic=421302.msg3094146#msg3094146 date=1263140228]</p>

Yeah iTunes is made to sync nicely with the iPod and allows you to buy music legally… I know, let’s Winamp!!</p>

<p>You shouldn’t really carry on buying stuff if you might be charging someone. Did you go into a store and physically buy the card?</p>
<p>If the card and your itunes store account are in no way linked to a bank account or credit card you should be fine, but bear in mind you probably gave them your address when you created an account so they might invoice you or something…</p>
