    <title>&lt;3 mySQL sources - Step By Step Guide - Request</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/3-mysql-sources-step-by-step-guide-request/259975</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve bought an official website, no more [b]free[/b] webhosts or .100mb.com crap. I&#39;ve bought a real website and i would love for someone to share there knowledge.

Basically, i want to put my mySQL Dodian ( Or haven ) source online. I&#39;ve asked alot of people but they ignore. I&#39;m not looking for a smart remark. Just some help.

Yes i used google.com and the search bar. No one seems to be helping. So i thought i&#39;d ask the experts &lt;3.

Thank you very much. &lt;3

p.s : a step by step guide would be lovely. pm me if u wish.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 02, 2009, 11:11:53 pm[/size][hr]bump</description>
