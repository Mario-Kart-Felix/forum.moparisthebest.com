    <description>Hey,

I was about to create a tut on how to download and play PlayStation X and 2 games on your pc... But I can&#39;t find the ONE rom I wanted the most. If anyone has that awesome game Monkey Magic for PlayStation X can anyone please, insert the disc into your pc, copy everything, ZIP it, and upload it. You will be credited in the tut, and I give rep for help, because that&#39;s just the right thing to do. Thanks to anyone who took the time to load and read this.
