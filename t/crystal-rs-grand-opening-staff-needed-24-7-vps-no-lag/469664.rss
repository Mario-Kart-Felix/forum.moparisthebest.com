Background Information:

Crystal-RS has been started in 2010 by the owners: “Svenie1 and Yoshi”. After a few days the server began to increase faster and faster. After a while we had build up a decent community. But.. eventually we had no time left to spent on the server, because of school. And unfortunately, players began to leave then, and finally Crystal-RS was gone. 
(Despite that, we are making our comeback, and we will seriously get back to work again. To satisfy our players, and let them have a great experience in this server.)

We hope we’ll see you at the Opening and we wish you to have the utmost fun!

Greetings,
Yoshi and Svenie1
