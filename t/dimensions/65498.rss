    <title>Dimensions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dimensions/65498</link>
    <description>Well, from what i&#39;ve read there are 3 dimensions we can see.

A dot.
A line.
A cube.


And a fourth we cant see but we can form in our minds.

A hypercube.

I&#39;ve read that it may be possible there are 5 or even more dimensions, what are your views?

BTW, the 5th is called Psi, if your wondering. I am wondering because i recently read a book on a woman who was making dinner while her daughter was at the movies, but as soon as she left, she got hit by a car, the mother just &quot;knew&quot; and called the theater, and they said that it had JUST happened and asked how she knew. I, myself, and quite a few other people believe that it could have been a reaction of calling out through the daughter&#39;s mind and breaking, by accident, into the dimension of Psi, and then breaking back into the regular dimension, how else could it be possible? 

Post what you think and back up WHY!</description>

<p>I went to that website a few days ago, and it’s got an excellent theory. I would just like to recommend that if you have a few spare minutes, and a few quiet hours to think about it, going to this website would be a very good idea if you wanna think deep.<br>
And just to summarise it, 0D (or dimension zero) is a point, <em>skip a bit</em> and the tenth dimension is also a point, as no line can be created from it as that point is all the space of all the possible timelines of all possible universes, and there simply cannot be another point to join this to to create a line.</p>

              <p>This is just something that I remember from a while back.<br>
Umm…<br>
Imagine you have a square of paper. Now imagine you have a torch.<br>
If you shone the torchlight onto the paper in such a way that it created a line, hey presto, you just got the first part of what I’m trying to say…<br>
Now if you do the same thing with a line of paper (can’t think of what else to call it) then you’ll get a dot. So far, we’ve god the first and second dimensions.<br>
Now if you do the same thing with a cube, you get a square. And there is the third dimension.<br>
Finally, you get a tesseract (or a hypercube, whichever sounds better). If you shone a light onto that, what do you get?</p>
<p>You guessed it! A cube (did you really guess it?)<br>
But like xxlegitxx said, it’s very hard to explain in the 3D world.<br>
There’s some food for thought.</p>

              <p>First of all, its a line, a plane, and a cube.  The fourth dimension is a tesseract, as described in “A Wrinkle in Time.”  To my understanding, its like a bunghole.  My bad, wormhole.  You cannot easily represent a fourth dimension in a 3-dimensional world, just like you cannot represent a cube effectively on a plane.</p>
