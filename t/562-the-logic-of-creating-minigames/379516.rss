    <title>[562] The Logic of creating minigames</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-the-logic-of-creating-minigames/379516</link>
    <description>Almost every main minigame in runescape is broken up into common classes. I normally just call these classes by the minigames appreciated named, and the function of the class. I&#39;ll simply show castle wars and explain it, since I don&#39;t feel like releasing my complete soul wars.

This is not a complete base, but will give you a decent start, and a greater understanding on how a minigame truly works.

First create 3 new class files.
- CastleWars.java
-- The function of this file is to tie in all the constants and actually create the functions of castle wars. You will see later examples of what it is actually used for.
- CastleWarsConstants.java 
-- A better abreivated name would be like CwarsConstants.java, but basically this is where you declare all your booleans, ints, and enums. You will later call for them through a static import which I will explain later when it comes up.
- CastleWarsObjects.java
-- Very self explainitory but for those that don&#39;t understand it will handle all the objects used in the minigame. You could use the main object handling class if you wanted, but it is much easier and organized if the objects for each minigame are handled with the same package as castle wars.

Castle Wars Constants:
Start off by declaring your package, this is simply the position of the file in your source. Or better said the location of the class file.
Since my source is not like any others in packaging, you can see it as an example but do not actually use it. Replace it with what yours should be.
[code]
package com.ember.minigames.castlewars;
[/code]

Declare your class name now, this is the name of the class.
[code]
public class CastleWarsConstants {
[/code]

Everything that goes below this will be your constants.
The common constants for castle wars are;
- Game Timer
- Wait time
- Zamorak score
- Saradomin Score
- Zamorak Flag
- Saradomin Flag
If you want to go all out like I started to do you will have also;
- Door 1 (true/false)
- Door 2 (true/false)
- Barricade count for each team
- Catapult (Functioning/Needs repair)

Here is what mine look like.
[code]
public static int WAIT_TIME = 200;
	public static int GAME_TIME = 600;
	
	public static int ZAMMY_COUNT = 0;
	public static int SARA_COUNT = 0;
	
	public static int ZAMMY_SCORE = 0;
	public static int SARA_SCORE = 0;
	
	public static boolean SARA_FLAG = true;
	public static boolean ZAMMY_FLAG = true;
	
	public static String ZAMMY_STATUS = &quot;&quot;;
	public static String SARA_STATUS = &quot;&quot;;
	
	public static int ZAMMY_BARRICADE = 0;
	public static int SARA_BARRICADE = 0;
	
	public static boolean ZAMMY_DOOR_ONE = false;
	public static boolean ZAMMY_DOOR_TWO = false;
	
	public static boolean SARA_DOOR_ONE = false;
	public static boolean SARA_DOOR_TWO = false;
	
	public static boolean ZAMMY_CATAPULT = false;
	public static boolean SARA_CATAPULT = false;
[/code]

Notice they are in upper case with _ between words, this is the proper way of writing constants in java.

Now just end that class with a final bracket.
[code]
}
[/code]

CastleWarsObjects.java

This class handles all the objects in the minigame as stated earlier, as before declare the package and class name like so.
[code]
package com.ember.minigames.castlewars;

/**
 * Handles all objects used in Castle Wars
 * @author Emily
 *
 */
public class CastleWarsObjects {
[/code]

Now create a method, or public void if you will. It will be public so that you can call for it in your main object class. Also add an additional int in named id or objectId, so that in your main object class you can replace this name with the name of the objects. I will show it/explain it better with code.
[code]
public void handleObject(int objectId) {
[/code]
The int objectId will be the object id obviously. I name it handleObject since it is easier to understand what it does later if you some how forget.

Now you are going to use a switch statement, a switch statement basically switches the objectId, into case numbers. Although this doesn&#39;t really do anything performance wise, it looks much cleaner then a million if statements.
[code]
switch(objectId) {
[/code]

Now I can&#39;t help you much below this point since I haven&#39;t done any objects my self yet. But here is how you would do it.
[code]
case 0://The Object Id is the case Number
//Do stuff here, what the object will do will go in here
break;//ends the case, every case needs a break
}//ends the switch statement
}//ends the void method

}//ends the class file
[/code]

The main CastleWars.java file
- This is where everything is declared for the minigame, all these statements will be called for in other classes. 

Declare your packaging and class name again...

[code]
package com.ember.minigames.castlewars;

import static com.ember.minigames.castlewars.CastleWarsConstants.*;

import com.ember.model.player.Player;
/**
 * 
 * @author Emily
 *
 */
public class CastleWars {
[/code]

I would like to make a special note to this
[code]
import static com.ember.minigames.castlewars.CastleWarsConstants.*;
[/code]

This allows you to use the constants in your constants class, without actually using a call method of that class file, so instead of;
[code]
CastleWarsConstants.ZAMMY_SCORE += 1;
[/code]
It&#39;s simply
[code]
ZAMMY_SCORE += 1;
[/code]

Now below here, also I can&#39;t give you much help. I&#39;ll give you an example though of scoring since it works amazingly.

[code]
private Player p;

public void zamorakScore() {
		if(p.Zattack == true) {
			if(p.getInventory().contains(4444) ||
					p.getEquipment().get(0).getId() == 4444) {//Change Ids to Saradomins Banner
				p.getInventory().deleteItem(4444, 1);//Change Id to Sara Banner
				p.getEquipment().deleteItem(4444, 1);//Change Id to Sara Banner
				ZAMMY_SCORE += 1;
				SARA_FLAG = true;
			} else {
				p.sm(&quot;You do not have Saradomins Flag.&quot;);
			}
		} else if(p.Sattack == true) {
			ZAMMY_FLAG = false;
			p.getInventory().addItem(4444, 1);//Change to Id of Zamorak  Banner
			p.sm(&quot;You steal Zamoraks Flag.&quot;);
		}
	}
[/code]
- Note for the above code to work for you, you need to declare the following in your player class, most likely named player.java
[code]
public transient boolean Sattack = false;
public transient boolean Zattack = false;
[/code]
It is named public so that i can obviously be called for in other classes, its named transient so that it does not save to player file. It is a boolean so it is either true or false.

Since everyone complains in this section about explaining their code I&#39;ll break it down for you...
[code]
if(p.Zattack == true) {
[/code]
If the player&#39;s boolean Zattack is true..then
[code]
if(p.getInventory().contains(4444) ||
					p.getEquipment().get(0).getId() == 4444) {
[/code]
If the player&#39;s inventory contains (itemId), it isn&#39;t 4444 just I couldn&#39;t be bothered to look up the actual itemid.
OR
since their is a || in their, it means or, so either they have it in their inventory, or they equipment contains it.
then...
[code]
p.getInventory().deleteItem(4444, 1);//Change Id to Sara Banner
				p.getEquipment().deleteItem(4444, 1);//Change Id to Sara Banner
[/code]
We delete the item from both the inventory and the equipment.
[code]
ZAMMY_SCORE += 1;
				SARA_FLAG = true;
[/code]
We increase the score of Zamorak, and then we make the Saradomin flag once again back at its base (true), the game continues as planned...
then
if the player&#39;s boolean Zattack is true, but does not contain the item
[code]
} else {
				p.sm(&quot;You do not have Saradomins Flag.&quot;);
			}
[/code]
We send a message stating what ever, in this case &quot;You do not have Saradomins Flag.&quot;

Then, else if the player&#39;s Sattack is true, then
[code]
} else if(p.Sattack == true) {
			ZAMMY_FLAG = false;
			p.getInventory().addItem(4444, 1);//Change to Id of Zamorak  Banner
			p.sm(&quot;You steal Zamoraks Flag.&quot;);
		}
[/code]
We make the Zamorak&#39;s flag boolean false (stolen), and then add the item to their inventory (or equipment if you want)
Then we send a message stating the flag has been stolen.

Last little thing I&#39;ll show is how the objects or what ever, are called in other classes.

Object1PacketHandler.java (my main object class)
below your switch statement for your objects..
[code]
case 0://object Id goes here same as in your castle wars objects file
CastleWarsObjects.handleObjects(id);
break;
[/code]
Id, is the int value in your main handleObjects method at the top of that file.

That is all for now, do what you wish with this. This is common knowledge that alot of people lack.</description>

<p>p.s: Your visual/naming conventions and general efficiency need working on.</p>
