    <title>My Current Project- WebTop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-current-project-webtop/67556</link>
    <description>Hey Guys,

    I got a great idea from [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,53399.0.html]this[/url] post. If your to lazy to load it, it&#39;s a tutorial on how to make your desktop a web page, so you can do things like play RuneScape from your desktop. This idea wasn&#39;t new to me as before I learned anything about computers, I learned everything I could about Windows. What was new to me was that you can you select an image file under the desktop tab in the desktop properties, but an .html file. So I thought, if I can do that, than I can put things on my desktop from there that I am to lazy to wait for them to boot up, and it will reduce memory usage. For anyone who&#39;s had 192mb ram or less, you know the pain and lag you must go through to listen to music and play a game like RuneScape at the same time. Now I have a GB of ram, but I&#39;m still lazy, and feel for the people who have to turn on their iPods before they play RuneScape. I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s going to run like your not running it, but because your not loading Windows Media Player, Win Amp, iTunes, or whatever else you use and instead using html, it will run a lot smoother. That&#39;s not the only thing you can do, ever heard of that ram hog, Desktop X, awesome widgets that make ur pc look kick ass, but with low memory, can be a total ram hog. Things like calendars, email checkers, anything possible with web code and flash, will be possible with this. Here&#39;s a pic of the first layout I just made. I&#39;m skilled enough with web development to make a basic one, with music, video, and a minibrowser, but I&#39;ll need the help of people with Java Script, Flash, and html variation. I call this project, WebTop:

[center][img]http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/9324/layoutcopymt7.jpg[/img][/center]

it can work like a regular web template, except for your Desktop. I can&#39;t really call this a program, or complete web development because if I were to market this, i&#39;d have to create a batch script installer or something, but any help will share plenty of credit.

Thanks for reading,

Buzzy

UPDATE: I just found out, that unless in a &lt;div&gt; code, or a flash, or javascript applet, your mouse won&#39;t take action (ie. clicking on links). I know enough Flash to fix that, so no big problems.</description>
