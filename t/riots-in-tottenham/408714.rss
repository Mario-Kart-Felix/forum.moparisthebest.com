<p>And what if I’m well trained with a melee weapon? I don’t see why you feel like you need to be able to kill the person. In a case where someone is 100% going to kill you, it makes sense but the thing is guns aren’t always used by intelligent, law-abiding citizens whose lives are in danger.<br>
More access to guns means more access for irrational people, or criminals and I’ve met more than my fair share of irrational people in the States. I would not trust them with the power to kill someone so easily.</p>

<p>Responsibility of the citizen to stay in shape. Maybe it’ll get rid of the fatties.<br>
Plus there are many alternatives to something like a bat. Old lady with a sword is still someone with a sword, I wouldn’t fuck with them.<br>
I just don’t think most people should be given the power of a gun, too easy to kill someone.</p>

</aside>
<p>Guns are 100% effective at preventing crime against victims?</p>
<p>That goes against consensus, such as studies showing that victims with guns are no less likely to be killed in a homicide than victims without guns (Matthew Miller, Deborah Azrael &amp; David Hemenway, Firearm Availability and Unintentional Firearm Deaths) and the fact that living in a state with looser gun restrictions makes one more likely statistically to die to an illegal gun use (ie, not in self defense).</p>

</aside>
<p>Thats your opinion, according to what statistics I found (For Norway), your family would be less safe with you having a gun. (Statistically, I do not suggest you would ever do such things).</p>
<p>And I would say I personally would be less safe with a gun, since I would then give the person that most likely to kill me an easy weapon to use. And no gun could protect me there. (I’m more than 100 times more likely to be killed by myself, than someone murder me with a gun).</p>
<p>Why risk such a big change in our justice system, when the risk we are fighting is so low?</p>

              <p>The general public shouldn’t be trusted to protect themselves in emergency situations?  That’s ridiculous!  Who else is going to protect them?  Sure, you should always try to stop crime by fixing root causes, but that obviously won’t stop crime all together.</p>
<p>To get a gun?  Here in my state of Ohio you have to be 18 to own a ‘long-gun’ (shotgun or rifle, anything but a handgun), and 21 to own a handgun.  You have to pass a background check (can’t have felonies etc) to buy a gun from a dealer (they call in your info to the feds, it takes a few minutes).  That allows you to just own it though, you can’t carry it loaded and you can’t carry it in your car or anything.  You can of course use it for self defense in your home though.</p>
<p>To actually get a concealed carry permit, enabling you to carry a handgun in public, you have to pass a very strict federal background check with fingerprints (takes a few weeks), and take a 12 hour government approved gun safety class, with 10 hours of classroom instruction and 2 hours of shooting time at the range.  You have to pass an accuracy test (iirc, hit 29 out of 32 12" targets at 7 yards), and a written test at the end of the class.  Then you take your class certificate to the local sheriff’s office, give fingerprints, take pictures, and wait no longer than 45 days to get your permit.</p>

There are also drugs that make someone entirely ignore those things, like PCP for example, which makes the user feel like super-man.  The only way to stop someone like that is to stop the heart from beating immediately, like by putting a few rounds through it.<br>

<p>The most crime-ridden cities and states in the US are those that have the strictest gun laws, even here, many don’t allow law-abiding citizens to own guns, let alone carry them.  In Chicago, Illinois for instance, private citizens can own long-guns, like shotguns and things, but only with a permit given to them by the police, and they don’t have to be issued one.  Then they have to transport it disassembled separate from the ammunition, and I think they can’t even keep it loaded in the house, so it’s useless for self defense.  But in the city of Chicago gun crime is crazy, I watched 4 minutes of WGN (a news station in Chicago) the other day, and they reported 3 gun murders, 1 killed a 6-year old girl, the other a 13-year old.  It’s all because criminals have all the guns, and law-abiding citizens don’t have any.<br>

<p>And as for your argument to self-defence for old people, surely a tazer or pepper-spray would be a much better choice? Both much easier to use, not to mention non-lethal![/quote]</p>
<p>A tazer has 1 shot, what good is that against multiple people?  Also many people are immune to the effects of a tazer or pepper spray, I’ve seen it myself many times on police shows.  There are also drugs that make someone entirely ignore those things, like PCP for example, which makes the user feel like super-man.  The only way to stop someone like that is to stop the heart from beating immediately, like by putting a few rounds through it.</p>
<p>Also, why is everyone so obsessed with non-lethal things?  Guns are only meant to be used when you feel your life is in imminent danger, so if they are trying to kill you, why would you risk your life trying not to kill them?  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>Also: <span class="mention">@MITB</span>. Perhaps the USA having an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071214070953/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/guic.pdf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">estimated 223m guns (non government/military/police)</a> is the reason why all the criminals can get access to guns so easily in those states that don’t permit concealed guns.</p>
<p>That was a study done in 1995, but we’ve all heard the claims that gun sales went through the roof after 11/9, and I can’t imagine it has gone down much. 223m in a population of 311m is pretty high.</p>

<p>If your theory is correct, Mopar, why does the US have higher homicide and rape rates than the UK? You have guns, you can defend yourselves, right?</p>

</aside>
<p>The most crime-ridden cities and states in the US are those that have the strictest gun laws, even here, many don’t allow law-abiding citizens to own guns, let alone carry them.  In Chicago, Illinois for instance, private citizens can own long-guns, like shotguns and things, but only with a permit given to them by the police, and they don’t have to be issued one.  Then they have to transport it disassembled separate from the ammunition, and I think they can’t even keep it loaded in the house, so it’s useless for self defense.  But in the city of Chicago gun crime is crazy, I watched 4 minutes of WGN (a news station in Chicago) the other day, and they reported 3 gun murders, 1 killed a 6-year old girl, the other a 13-year old.  It’s all because criminals have all the guns, and law-abiding citizens don’t have any.</p>
<p>[quote=“Holic, post:46, topic:408714”]I feel like Mopar hasn’t seen Bowling for Columbine. You gun toting yanks are too much.<br>
I have a bat in my room, that’s all I need. If someone’s going to kill you they will, gun or no gun. If they’re breaking in, I’ll just crack them with it a few times. Problem solved.[/quote]<br>
We had to watch that sorry excuse for a movie in school, obviously k-mart selling common types of ammo was the reason those kids did that right?  If k-mart would have said “we don’t carry 9mm ammo”, they would have went home and never hurt anyone right?  If you believe that, I’ve got some ocean front property in Arizona I’d like to sell you.</p>
<p>As to your bat, I feel like a broken record here.  That is fine for you, maybe against a couple thugs, but what about more?  Also, do you expect your average 70+ year old woman to be able to even use a bat in defense?  Not having the right to bear arms is only giving the right to self-defense to the young and strong, and criminals will still have guns regardless.</p>
