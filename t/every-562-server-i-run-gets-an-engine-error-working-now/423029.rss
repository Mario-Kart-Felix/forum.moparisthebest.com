    <title>Every 562 server i run gets an Engine Error? *Working now</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/every-562-server-i-run-gets-an-engine-error-working-now/423029</link>
    <description>Hello

Over the past few days i wanted to have a play around on a runescape private server and managed to get a 317 server working fine (i can go on it and play around). However i got a 562 server as i wanted HD and more features to play with. But the server wouldn&#39;t start. Im not a complete Noob i know that its not where my JDK is or the version it is. I even watched a youtube video just to check if i was doing it right. The one on the video started up and mine gets an error. Ive tried multiple differant sources and none at 562 seem to work.

pastebin of the error: [url=http://pastebin.com/UvxuqDph]http://pastebin.com/UvxuqDph[/url]


*Edit I have found its related to me being on 64-bit windows and having 32-bit and 64-bit versions of both JRE and JDK and i found when running the server with JRE6 32-bit it worked perfectly.

Thanks anyways
