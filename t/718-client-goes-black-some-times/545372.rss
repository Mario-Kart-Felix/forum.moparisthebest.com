    <title>718 client goes black some times</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-client-goes-black-some-times/545372</link>
    <description>Ok, so I just got a few new players on my new server.. And when one of them walks into the general store, the client goes black screen and he gets logged out... then he cant log into his acc again, so i have to log in, then tele him home with the command ;;sendhome i have to spam it, then he crashes again, then he can log back in.
It also happens sometimes when he teleports and just at random times.
I dont get any errors in the run.bat, and I have no idea what is wrong.

I am using rune evo v3 source with the foxtrot 718 client
If you can help please let me know, because it will stop people from playing.
Thanks.</description>
