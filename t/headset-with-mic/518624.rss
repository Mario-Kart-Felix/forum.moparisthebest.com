    <title>Headset with mic</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/headset-with-mic/518624</link>
    <description>I am looking for a wireless headset with a microphone in the price range of about 25-45$. 

They don&#39;t have to be fancy, colorful, nothing like that.

I just need a basic pair that is going to feel comfortable to wear for like 2-3 hours a day. Needs to be able to fit a larger head ( Adult - larger person )

All the different electronic sites I have looked at they aren&#39;t very specific in the sense of &quot;comfort&quot;

I am not picky about &quot;sound quality&quot; as long as it works I will be alright.</description>

              <p>You won’t get cheap wireless voice chat. Just using turtle beach as an example: Their X32s ($99) are the first wireless headset. The game sounds are wireless, and so can be used on the PC just fine wireless, but voice chat requires the cable running from headset -&gt; controller/pc. You won’t get 100% wireless until the XP300s ($169).</p>
<p>Most gaming headsets will have a very long cable because they know how far away the console can be sometimes, and now it needs to be hidden etc.</p>

<p>Do all of these good headsets come with like “re-attachable” cables of some kind?</p>

The headset itself is pretty good.<br>
This is how you setup the headset for the PC and he links you where to buy the lil $1 or so jack you need.</p>

<p>Turtle beach x12. They’re around $50.00 USD, but they’re worth it. I can use them up to 6 hours at a time without my ears feeling sore or anything.

<p>I think it said it was PC compatible but want to make sure with you? How about wireless? I read something about a usb port so didn’t know if it was talking about wireless or corded usb.</p>

              <p>Turtle beach x12. They’re around $50.00 USD, but they’re worth it. I can use them up to 6 hours at a time without my ears feeling sore or anything. They’re a tad pricey for what you’re looking for, but when my girlfriend bought me them it instantly became probably one of my favorite gifts ever.</p>

              <p>I am looking for a wireless headset with a microphone in the price range of about 25-45$.</p>
<p>They don’t have to be fancy, colorful, nothing like that.</p>
<p>I just need a basic pair that is going to feel comfortable to wear for like 2-3 hours a day. Needs to be able to fit a larger head ( Adult - larger person )</p>
<p>All the different electronic sites I have looked at they aren’t very specific in the sense of “comfort”</p>
<p>I am not picky about “sound quality” as long as it works I will be alright.</p>
