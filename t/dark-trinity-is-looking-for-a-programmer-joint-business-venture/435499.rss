    <title>Dark Trinity is looking for a programmer || Joint business venture</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dark-trinity-is-looking-for-a-programmer-joint-business-venture/435499</link>
    <description>Hello.

I&#39;ll make this very short and easy, as there is a much more complex proposal document available for anyone that is interested in the venture.
I am looking for Java programmer, competant with the technlogy and able to integrate their knowledge to a Runescape private server to a satisfactory standard.
You may be working alongside a fully-fledged professional in programming, specialising in C+ currently working on turbines for Rolls Royce.

I am very experienced in 3D Modelling, VFX design and composition. 
I am very experienced in Runescape having played it for &gt;10 years and I have a *lot* of experience in directing traffic to a desired destination, namely the server.
I am also an amateur at HTML/PHP scripting and beginner at Java - so i know some things.
I have various contacts that will enable the launch to be smooth on a large-scale.
I will also be the finance of the server.
I have also bought forum licensing software and have prepared various other neccessities.
All you need to do is essentially assist the other programmer getting used to Runescape and also to do work yourself, namely to find glitches.

Negotiations about anything else will be considered.

Interested in a position?
Want to know more information?
Wish to see the proposal document?

email me: trinity@dot.net
or Skype: thedarktrinity


I look forward to hearing from you.</description>
