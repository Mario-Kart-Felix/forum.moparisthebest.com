    <title>Atrium 317 Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/atrium-317-client/330560</link>
    <description>Well this is an extremely outdated client which has nothing in it but like one or two edits. Considering the fact that I&#39;m moving on to 459 and don&#39;t need it any more, I&#39;ve decided I may as well release it. 474 models load relatively quickly, and they work flawlessly.

Iirc the features are:

[ul][li]474 Models[/li]
[li]474 Items[/li]
[li]474 NPCs[/li]
[li]Infinity icon[/li]
[li]Refactored, get over it...[/li][/ul]


Don&#39;t ask me how I did any of it because I don&#39;t remember (I&#39;m pretty sure some of it is Palidino&#39;s work, so credit to him if deserved). Item ids are the same as 474, as are NPC ids and model ids. To add infinity serversided just look at SWAT&#39;s tut I don&#39;t remember how. It would be loaded through the cache but it decided to act up on me so ha, deal with it. This client is mine from the bottom up however I used the BattleScape login method and forgot to change it back. Apart from that, the client is completely clean.

Only picture I have sorry. I really don&#39;t feel like reconfiguring my whole server just to show you guys a couple of items, however if someone wants to upload a picture or two that&#39;s fine with me. Especially your pussy-ass virus scans.

Bug fixes:
Fixing npcs:
Cut and paste music.dat and music.idx from the cache folder into another folder like on your desktop.
Go to toms cache suite hit open cache find cache and then hit the cache folder.
Now repeat step two but open a blank 317 cache.
Go to config.jag - npc.dat and npc.idx and export them
Go to config.jag - npc.dat and npc.idx on the client cache and remove them then replace them.
Cut and paste music.dat and music.idx from whatever you put in before and move it back into cache foldar.
In short, export a 317 npc.dat and .idx and import them to the client cache.


Tell me what to fix?</description>

There’s a reason I haven’t taken many pictures. It’s basically a refactored deob with one main thing added. Which is why if you’d like you can take pictures of some 474 items, because that’s pretty much all that’s in it.</p>
