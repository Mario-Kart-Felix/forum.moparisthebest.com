The only I  know of to transfer items is through Bounty Hunter, and that is a really unsafe way.</p>
<p>Best to try it with a few small amounts until you know your boundaries and how much you are willing to lose in case of a mishap. I’m not to familiar with how this is done, however, as I haven’t tried bounty hunter before.<br>

<p>I tanked out about 4m of stuff in F2P to ten level 110+'s[/quote]</p>
<p>You can only have 1 piece of armour on at a time. Me and my friend tried to take 2 sara pl8s and it would not let us.</p>
<p>as in you cannot have more then 1 set of something…</p>

              <p>you could also do it by buying a crap load of items that are cheap in a store, but sell high in the GE or trade, and then trade them such as 20k cheese.</p>
<p>Although you wont transfer all the money, you’ll transfer a lot.</p>
