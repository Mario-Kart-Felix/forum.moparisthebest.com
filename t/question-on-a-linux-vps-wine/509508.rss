    <title>Question on a Linux VPS/WINE</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-on-a-linux-vps-wine/509508</link>
    <description>I have been using WINE to get things going, just makes it a hell of a lot easier on me.

The problem thus far is my compilers cannot find the java. I have the newest versions of the linux/windows installed. The compiler I was using is set to the java where it would be on windows. Where to I have to set the path to so that it picks up the windows version of the java, since I am running the .bat in WINE.

Also: Is it possible to code and compile in windows, then bring the entire folder to the VPS? Or would that cause a break somewhere? This would alleviate all problems. 

Very new to this, I have a vps that&#39;s not getting any use. I would like to give my self some peace of mind on my spent cash. So bare with my newness.</description>
