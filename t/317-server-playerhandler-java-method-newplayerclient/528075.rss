    <title>317 Server: (PlayerHandler.java) - Method &quot;newPlayerClient&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-server-playerhandler-java-method-newplayerclient/528075</link>
    <description>Hello!

I got a 317 Delta RSPS I am programming on, but I got a tricky method I don&#39;t quite understand.

Here is the method:
[code]//A new client connected...
	public void newPlayerClient(java.net.Socket s, String connectedFrom)	{
		//First, search for a free slot
		// int slot = -1, i = playerSlotSearchStart;
		int slot = -1;
		
		for (int i = 1; i &lt; players.length; i++)	{
			if ((players[i] == null) || players[i].disconnected)	{
				slot = i;
				break;
			}	
		}
		
		Client newClient = new Client(s, slot);
		newClient.handler = this;
		(new Thread(newClient)).start();
		
		if (slot == -1)	{
			return; //No free slot found - world is full.
		}
		
		players[slot] = newClient;
		players[slot].connectedFrom = connectedFrom;
		players[slot].ip = s.getInetAddress().hashCode();
		Player.localId = slot;
		players[slot].lastPacket = System.currentTimeMillis();
		//Start at next slot when issuing the next search to speed it up
		playerSlotSearchStart = slot + 1;
		
		if (playerSlotSearchStart &gt; maxPlayers)	{
			playerSlotSearchStart = 1;
		}
		// Note that we don&#39;t use slot 0 because playerId zero does not function
		// properly with the Client.
	}[/code]
The method is located in a class called &quot;PlayerHandler&quot;.

Here&#39;s what I understand:
 - The method gets called after the client&#39;s socket gets accepted by the server&#39;s &quot;clientListener&quot;.
 - The method uses information about the connection&#39;s socket and I believe &quot;connectedFrom&quot; is going
   to be it&#39;s IP-address?  :|

I believe the method tries to find an open slot in a world, and if the world is full, it wants the player to try a different world? :|

Could somebody please guide me trough line by line what is going on?
I&#39;m sorry if this could be asked in a general Java forum, but I want people that understands RSPS to answer it, as they would probably understand the logic in the naming of objects, method and variables.  :)

Thanks!</description>

<p>If you look at Client.java, it extends the Player class.</p>

<p>When we extend an existing class, we ‘inherit’ all of the attributes, and methods, of the parent class.</p>

<p>The handler is a variable of newClient. “this” refers to the instance/file where it is in. (Some weird way to explain it)</p>
<p>If you’d go to where the handler is declared you’ll see that handler’s type is “PlayerHandler”.<br>
When you set the newClient.handler’s value to “this” it actually litterally means THIS. The instance of the playerHandler wherein this code is initiated.</p>
<p>Atleast that’s how I always understood it.</p>

              <p>Alright so, I’ll do my best to explain it a bit. (Kinda in a rush right now.)</p>
<p><code>                for (int i = 1; i &lt; players.length; i++)        {
                        if ((players[i] == null) || players[i].disconnected)        {
                                slot = i;
                                break;
                        }       
                }
</code></p>
<p>Here it searches for an “open slot.” this means that it’ll go over the array players and when the value equals null, meaning there is no player yet in that spot it saves the index of that slot to the variable slot.<br>
So now we found which slot we’ll put this new connection in.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">                Client newClient = new Client(s, slot);
                newClient.handler = this;
                (new Thread(newClient)).start();
               
                if (slot == -1)        {
                        return; //No free slot found - world is full.
                }[/code]

A new instance of Client gets made, we'll name it newClient and give it as parameter the socket and the slot where we want it to go. We assign its handler and start the thread for the newClient.
If slot was found to be -1 it would mean they hadn't found an empty slot in the players array so the world is basicly full.

[code]                players[slot] = newClient;
                players[slot].connectedFrom = connectedFrom;
                players[slot].ip = s.getInetAddress().hashCode();
                Player.localId = slot;
                players[slot].lastPacket = System.currentTimeMillis();</code></pre>
<p>First they put the Client into the players array and use the free slot as index.<br>
Then they assign the proper values to the attributes if I may call it so.</p>
<p>[code]                playerSlotSearchStart = slot + 1;</p>
<pre><code>            if (playerSlotSearchStart &gt; maxPlayers)        {
                    playerSlotSearchStart = 1;
            }[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>Basicly it just assigns the value of the slot + 1 to playerSlotSearchStart so next time we could go search from that slot and don’t have to start all over searching from slot 1.</p>
<p>Then if playerSlotSearch would’ve come above the maximum amount we get it back to 1.</p>
<p>Although, I think the for loop should have an adjustment so it would actually start searching from that new slot.</p>
<p><code>                for (int i = playerSlotSearchStart; i &lt; players.length; i++)        {
                        if ((players[i] == null) || players[i].disconnected)        {
                                slot = i;
                                break;
                        }       
                }</code></p>
