    <title>Female weapon weilding issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/female-weapon-weilding-issue/477873</link>
    <description>All weapons and shields are wielded to high, I figure this isn&#39;t a model error since its consistent with all weapons and shields, I tried to find a fix but tbh I&#39;m not even sure what to look for, any advise or help would be greatly appreciated.

              <p>I saw somewhat of a fix for this on Runeee-Serberrr. But, your item revision might be too high for your character models. Jagex seems to make the characters slightly bigger whenever they upgrade them.</p>
