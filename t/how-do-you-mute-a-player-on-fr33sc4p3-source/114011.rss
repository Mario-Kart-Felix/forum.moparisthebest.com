    <title>How do you mute a player on fr33sc4p3 source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-mute-a-player-on-fr33sc4p3-source/114011</link>
    <description>hi all, I was just wondering how you mute a player on the fr33c4p3 source, because it is really annoying when people keep macroing and auto typing, so instead of banning i could mute, so how do I do it?
