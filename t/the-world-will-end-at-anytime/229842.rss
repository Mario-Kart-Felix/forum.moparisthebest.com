    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-world-will-end-at-anytime/229842</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;SCIENTISTS are trying to stop the most powerful experiment ever – saying the black holes it will create could destroy the world.

Dubbed by some the Doomsday test, it will be carried out next week in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located 300ft underground near the French-Swiss border.

The machine is 17 miles long and cost £4.4billion to create.

When its switch is pulled on September 10, this atom-smasher will become a virtual time machine, revealing what happened when the universe came into existence 14 billion years ago.

New particles of matter are expected to be discovered, new dimensions found beyond the four known, as scientists re-create conditions in the first BILLIONTHS of a second after the Big Bang.

The atom smasher ... the 17-mile-long machine that some fear will destroy our planet

Experts even predict that millions of tiny black holes will be produced — baby brothers of the monsters gobbling up dust and stars at the heart of the galaxies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coming from [The Sun] I thinks it&#39;s bullshit.

<p>No it’s not. There is a large volcano in North America, in Yellowstone called “Old faithful”.

<p>I would tell you that you need to die, but I think some staffers might frown on that. The Geyser at Yellowstone National Park is called Old Faithful, and it erupts at certain times depending on the length time the geyser erupts. The geyser erupts because of the super volcano beneath it, creating heat and pressure in the water reservoir causing it to erupt for whatever length of time based on the amount of water that is in the reservoir.</p>
<p>There is no volcano in Yellowstone National Park called Old Faithful.</p>
