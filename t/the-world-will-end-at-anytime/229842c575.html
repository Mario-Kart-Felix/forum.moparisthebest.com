Did you know when you dream you pretty much dream everything your learned in your whole life not only what you did last night… its really sick how dreams could compiled into something that you would never think or imagine im talking about scenery and even the characters in your dream… you could even create a full body of what would be your perfect opposite those are the dreams that are well you know the wet ones… that you wake up with a boner.</p>

<p>If you were able to see atoms with your bare eyes, you get the same effect as looking to someone 2m away from you through binoculars. Eagles have great vision because they fly at high altitudes. Dogs/wolves have great ears because they use stealth and usually operate in bushy areas.</p>

        <p>[quote=“moparscape4lifez, post:98, topic:229842”][size=7pt]seriously would be funny if they dont make a blackhole but space it self… pretty much like using a eraser tool in mspaint…</p>
<p>then sooner or later all the oxygen in earth will be rushing into that space area because space is a vacuum?</p>
<p>Even if the blackhole is as tiny as a peice of rice it as a vacuum cleaner it would be sinking in all the air around it unless they somehow put a vacuum container over it which would possibly neutralize it or it’s effects for the time being…</p>
<p>but if space is really a transformer which would transforms molecules such as oxygen into more space then they have to keep it contained if a leak happens it might be too late to stop it will be growing and growing until either the world runs out of air which is unlikely because trees keep making it…  I don’t think it would be able to suck in objects such as people/houses/cars because if astronauts don’t get sinked in when they go into space that proves the theory is bogus and its only hunger is after stuff that flys like air/hydrogen/nitrogen. But im basing a blackhole on space it self which is my theory so i could be completely wrong.</p>
<p>Either way containment should be in control of military not civilians they should have military man at let protecting the perimeter around the 17 mile facility against arabic suicide bombers who want to get to allah faster or something if they bomb a crack in it that could be what causes the demise of earth.</p>
<p>As I said if air is the hunger is what these new particles crave then it be too risky… who knows if it even is possible to stop a blackhole from unforming… I believe the only way to unform one before it grows exponentially is uncreate the universe and so much shit in the universe … and nothing lowered the growth of space only increased it only our atmosphere is protecting us from it’s effects.[/size][/quote]</p>

        <p>Thing is… I don’t believe blind logic I try to piece together my own sense of understanding to things and I love understand and figuring out answers without no ones assistance.</p>
<p>Like I might be a sheep and follow that mentally retarded wheel chair guy’s theory about a black hole being a single matter or w\e with a huge radius around it… making huge gravity and makes stuff piled into it… but isn’t it better to think for yourself -_- being a sheep won’t get you far… you will die a sheep always being a sheep…</p>
<p>Hell I cracked the truth behind soundwaves… I always thought they were flying molecules of sound… Then I  did a experiment… with aluminum foil which isn’t solid at all and bends from just touching it… I figured when U tap it it makes a little sound so know I got into the theory of vibrations wasn’t 100% sure… because my hand would stop it as soon as it would tap it… because sound is kinda fast well faster then me letting go of my hand since vibrations so stretched it out a bowl which gave a hydraulic and yah so I would tap the bowl  it would tap the air… making a chain reaction of air movement that would bounce back… sooner or later making a ripple effect of decreasing sound…</p>
<p>then when I figured that out, all the other little facts connected to this taught were as common sense… for example I finally figured out what sound-proof glass really is… its just glass that doesn’t vibrate as much or not all (well u cant stop vibrations completely) figured out what the connection about the ear drum and ear hammer… it self having a beating hammer on top of a drum to amplify vibrations.</p>
<p>But anyways as you see I haven’t looked at any book I haven’t even confirmed that my common sense are really fact because one i’m not a doctor so I don’t even know that a hammer hits the drum… but its common sense eh?? thats the kind of things I seek to find out… the more common sense you build the more things start to stack up together… thats how the human mind works… it connects a chain of web’s and inner connects those that are connected to the same to form a feeling of common sense.</p>
<p>Anyways thinking of your own thoughts is much better then learning them… learning is flawed in one way you can never be too sure unless you see it done with your own eyes no video no picture should ever make you a believer those are easily faked.</p>

        <p>What do drugs or smoking have to do with anything? You don’t know shit man.</p>
<p>You’re sitting here bragging about god knows what (ear drums? sound waves?) thinking your the smartest shit ever. All you do is brag about how smart you are, and quite frankly you are dull.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think you are a troll when you make posts such as:</p>

If im not the only one who feels this way then i’ll shut up… but for a fact… if no one else feels like this then im smarter heh[/quote]</p>
