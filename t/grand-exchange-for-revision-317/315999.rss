    <title>Grand exchange for revision(317)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/grand-exchange-for-revision-317/315999</link>
    <description>Hey guys i&#39;m almost done with my project and I need some advice. The current way I have it set up is you basically have 2 banks on your character. One is your normal bank, Two is your grand exchange bank. This bank look like normal but you can only have 6 items in it at a time(Still working on stacking items...). When a user talks to the banker at the specific exchange booth it will give you two options, SELL or BUY. When a user selects BUY they have to type in the exact name of the item, if everything checks and they get the exact name right and have the lowest sellers price in their inventory, a confirm trade window will pop up to confirm that they do indead want to buy it for the amount. If they click accept it takes the money from there inventory and gives them the item. Then when the user logs in or goes back to there G/E bank the item will have been replaced with the gold amount they requested.... I put no gold request limit on any items and i have no intentions of it either. My question is any ideas on another way, maybe more cool then that? I don&#39;t particularly think its great.</description>
