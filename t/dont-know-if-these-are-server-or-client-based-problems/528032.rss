    <description>first off my bank wont save the items once I log out and back in the items are gone

second under my information tab there are clickable links for ingame actions one of them says &quot;exchange Epicurus tokens&quot; and when you click it, it opens up the donator shop and you can purchase items with donator tokens. the problem is I want it to say &quot;exchange Exotic tokens&quot; and I have no idea how to change that ive tried many different forms of searching 

ive spent countless hours on google searching for the answer I also posted this same topic under server help incase it is a server related problem
