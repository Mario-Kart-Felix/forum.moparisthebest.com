    <description>This user was banned for hacking (RATing and so on) from the forums, he ban evaded to play the server which he&#39;s admitted to another player of having multiple accounts on so he can carry out different tasks.

On one account he plays seriously, on another he griefs and hacks, and on the others he griefs other players also. I&#39;m posting this here because I want to keep him banned from the server and forums as I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the type of idiot we want anything to do with. 

One thing I have gathered is that he&#39;s using multiple VPNs we rely on words from him rather than IP evidence which makes it even harder to ban him.

Right now we know he&#39;s:

Oatmeal
I_code_rsps12
I_code_rsps

He also admitted to forum ban evading to me, he seems to think it&#39;s alright because &quot;he didn&#39;t RAT that many people&quot; and thinks it&#39;s alright. One of his forum accounts was:

<p>I think the issue we’re going to have is that he has very interesting client modifications. He’s been reported of being able to teleport through protected areas, and he uses a ton of VPNs which makes him hard to track.</p>
