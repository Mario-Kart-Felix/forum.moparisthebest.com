    <description>for some reason its not letting me talk to any npc. i want to be able to make it so i can spawn santa in varrock and you can talk to him and buy a santa hat off him for like 1000 whips or something random like that. also for some reason when i try to alter the prices of items say the santa hat it cost 168 gp. when i open up the file to alter it it says it cost 129.237032453997. and if i remove it and put 100 it changes the price to 126 gp. but when i change it to 1 gp, the price in shop is 1gp...???</description>

              <p>yes the help a little, just to make sure you know what im working with this is the page i downloaded it from <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,6915.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,6915.0.html</a> i mean there are a few things that need to be fixed when i downloaded it like when i hit a monster i deal 0 damage but it manages to kill it every time. also pretty much all the monsters drop dwarf remains. also do you know if i can spawn a bank booth ingame? or do i need to code it in a file somewhere? tyvm:D</p>
