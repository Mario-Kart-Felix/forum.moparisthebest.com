I came to visit and I saw that you guys made a server while I was gone and it looks pretty freaking cool. I look forward to having a go.

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I came to visit and I saw that you guys made a server while I was gone and it looks pretty freaking cool. I look forward to having a go.</p>
<p>But, where did everyone go? There used to be hundreds of people.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There still is ‘hundreds’</p>
<p>There used to be thousands… It used to be a ‘battle’ to get your help topic seen in the server help…<br>
Now? Lol, your topic will sit on page 1 for a week.<br>
[/quote]thats my fault because i dont help anymore lol[/quote]</p>
<p>Hahahaha. Staying true to your name I see.</p>
<p>Is anyone still hosting any decent servers? Is Silabgarza still around? The questions are endless and the answers are few.</p>
