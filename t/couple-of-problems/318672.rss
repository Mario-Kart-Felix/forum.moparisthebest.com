    <title>Couple of problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/couple-of-problems/318672</link>
    <description>I have a couple of issues I need help with: 

1) Currently I&#39;m running DDSSPECED V3 and I&#39;m having an issue using the &#39;offer x&#39; and withdraw &#39;x&#39; commands in the trade screens, and in the banks. What is my issue with that. Could someone post a working packet or w/e they are with how to fix this issue?

2) I&#39;ve just realized magic doesn&#39;t work. (normal spells and I&#39;m assuming others (i&#39;ll test in a minute) don&#39;t work either.)  How would I code in the magic? I&#39;m assuming I&#39;m just missing a file, or a method or something. Can someone point me towards a guide, or a way of adding it?

3) On DDSSPECED V3 you get an opening interface. You can edit the one line that was there originally, but that one line is about 3/4 down the interface and I&#39;d like to move the text further up. I tried changing the &#39;sendquest&#39; number or w/e to a number a bit higher (for instance, 11134 to 11133) and it doesn&#39;t change anything. Any ideas?

4) Last but not least, what would you look for in a server? 

Nobody helps anymore. :(</description>
