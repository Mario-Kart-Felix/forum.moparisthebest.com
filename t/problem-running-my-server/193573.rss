    <title>Problem Running My Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-running-my-server/193573</link>
    <description>Well, I have absolutely no idea whatsoever why this could have happened.

I was creating a Training area with one of my servers&#39; Head Admins. We were just walking around.. Figuring out where to put NPC&#39;s, and all of a sudden he starts to mass Login/Logout, so I decided to reset the server. That didn&#39;t work. When I ran the server It gave me this message.

[CODE]WorldObjects.cfg: file not found.
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 7
        at NPCHandler.loadAutoSpawn(NPCHandler.java:2402)
        at NPCHandler.&lt;init&gt;(NPCHandler.java:29)
        at server.main(server.java:30)
ZerkScape V2.0 is ONLINE![/CODE]

It lets you login, but then it just kind of loses connection every couple of seconds.

This is what I usually get when the I have successfully Ran the Server.

[CODE]WorldObjects.cfg: file not found.
ZerkScape V2.0 is ONLINE![/CODE]


And now, here are some pictures to give you a clearer view of my problem.

This is what I get when I run the server. It says it&#39;s online, and leaves a little note, but nothing seems to work.
Well anyway, that&#39;s what it looks like when it goes online.

[i]When I try to login:[/i]

It basically just loops. It repeatedly says that I&#39;m already logged in, and that I&#39;m trying again, but nothing is actually happening. The page says that I have lost connection and it just stays like that. I have also confirmed it, and other users have experienced this too. It&#39;s not just me.


Well I hope that&#39;s enough information, and I hope you can figure something out ;)
If you need more information, then tell me.

Thank you,

<p>Oh and just to keep in mind… I wouldn’t consider me a noob. I only got this error because some idiot from RL or something was spamming my mail asking me to prove somebodies tutorial crap. I didn’t go on and flame, but I tried the tutorial. I guess I forgot to delete one of the parts <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>EDIT: Nevermind. What I took away disabled NPC’s. I’m trying to look for that idiots tut through my History at the moment… Give some feedback until I find it… If I do… My History refreshes every time it shuts down. I better get started <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
