[size=10pt][center][b]Introduction[/b][/center]
This basically means there&#39;s no spawning and any items people obtain will have been earned through PVM or PKing. This means our items will have value, making everything more fun, giving players something to aim for and of course making it so much better when you finally get that kill for rare items. There are tons of different ways to exchange your items including specific market areas, clan chats, and even a dedicated section on forums. Being a new server we want to get our economy right the first time. To ensure we achieve this we have made drop rates at a perfect level to maintain item drops for PvMers, but also to give just enough that we&#39;re not flooded with items and massive inflation like you see on most other private servers.

[center][b]Skill-Points[/b][/center]
[center]Hate to train some skills? No problem! We have found a solution. When you level, you&#39;ll gain skill points. With these points you can level up other skills. How awesome is that!?[/center]
