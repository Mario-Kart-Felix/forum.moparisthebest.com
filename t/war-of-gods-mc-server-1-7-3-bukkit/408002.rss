    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/war-of-gods-mc-server-1-7-3-bukkit/408002</link>
    <description>War-of-Gods Minecraft Server is a Bukkit server running on 1.7.3

In War-of-Gods you start off in our main city which includes our Death respawn point at the Hospital, This town includes our WOG building with WOG going at an angle on the building which is multiple stories high where you can craft items, use a furnace for your ores to make ingots, glass, etc. You can go to the Hospital and we have multiple beds you can rest at, Collect water at our main pool in the town, collect lava from inside the town behind the main buildings or outside the town with lava surrounding it, let your anger out on our blow up site with tnt right outside the town having signs pointing you to the right direction, use our very long powered rail support to view around our scenery and view many different things in the town.

War-of-Gods has the Towny and Residence script for you to build your town and protect it

We also have the SignShops plugin for you to make your own chest shops for other players to buy from your own player owned shop
