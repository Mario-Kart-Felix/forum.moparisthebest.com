I&#39;m here looking for an experienced and dedicated coder for my 718/723 server(Panic PvP), It&#39;s going to be a PK/Eco server with skilling,etc. It will be a unique server unlike any other. I want a coder with more than just basic knowledge for bug fixes, but a coder who knows what they are doing and will apply themselves for the job. Currently the only developers are Me and Jake, but Jake may be quitting due to IRL issues. There&#39;s a lot of work to be done, but through great effort,comes great reward.

We have already started developing this server and I know what I want to be put into the server, but I don&#39;t have the required knowledge of coding to add everything to it, etc. I&#39;m available almost 24/7 via Skype for contact with you and I can fill you in on anything I haven&#39;t already explained in this thread.

Here&#39;s a picture of what I&#39;ve done just in about an hour or less:
