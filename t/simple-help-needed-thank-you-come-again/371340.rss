              <p>Thanks for the response but here are a few things that help you to help me no the client isn’t a ip changer and when i go into the client folder i found a this file named server that was on a notepad but there wasn’t anything i could change inside it. I even pressed the ctrl+f 127.0.0.1 but found nothing. However, I did manage to go in some folders and found this client file that was also in a notepad they also had the client that was a .java but when i try to edit it… that comes up with a bunch of weird symbols that made absolutely no sense. Anyways when i edit the client that was in a notepad i found the 127.0.0.1 which i changed to my ip. Hope i didn’t lose you but my question is where are the other files that is IMPORTANT to change the ip for. one more thing what do you mean by messing up the compiler? OH also Say if i was to send my client to my friend…ok How will it be possible for it to work if i have to have the server files and the clients files to play it? Sorry for all the question I just like to learn these types on thing’s</p>

              <p>Heres how:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Step 1:</span> Send him your client. If your client is a IP changer client then you won’t have to do the next step. Otherwise do step 2.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2:</span> Make sure that your client has your IP set so when you turn it on it connects to you.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3</span> If your client is IP changer then tell him your IP. Then he logs in and complete!</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to set your client IP then look it up. If this still doesn’t work then you probably didn’t port forward correctly.</p>
<p>Sorry if this wasn’t very descriptive.</p>
