    <title>How can i stop this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-stop-this/340817</link>
    <description>ok, the issue i have is not specific to a certain client, rather.. a certain client revision.

any 317 or 377 client i play on has a little issue, its not really an error its just really fucking annoying.

the issue is, while im playing, random sprites or parts of the gameframe start flashing randomly all over my screen (inside the client window)

and at times it gets really bad and i can hardly see what im doing

heres a video if you dont get what im saying:

additional information:
i noticed this started happening after i built my new computer, its components are significantly more complex and higher quality. 
so would that have any effect on anything?
This ONLY happens on 317 clients, 500+ clients run smoothly.</description>
