<p>These are my reasons for thinking that:<br>
1.) They chose to use the exact same shoutbox service as we have been using for years. (DARscape was previously a RSC and then a RS2 clan) (Cbox.ws) (No other servers use this exact service, nor the same color scheme)</p>
<p>2.) They do discounts on donations in order to “make ends meet.” We have off and on for the last 10 months had discount rates on donations for gifts. (2x rate) (Our policy is different - you don’t buy rares, you donate and receive a gift for donating - gifting is fairly legal, selling intellectual property is not)</p>
<p>3.) I have received a fair share of donations over a period of months, no where as much, but a good amount. I was out of work due to family reasons and thus could devote myself full time to the game development. My rationale was this: I work full time on this and what is left after the bills, I use on my bills. Sounds fair right? I was devoting my time as a full time developer and isn’t that what real businesses do? Their CEOs don’t work pro-bono. The sad reality was that I actually was spending a bit more out of my own pocket than donations were coming in so overall there was a net loss and not a profit, although I mostly broke even.</p>
<p>There are additional similarities in things I’ve seen which leads me to believe Project P2P emulates DARScape, but I have to leave for class.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alot alike? Never. I’ve played your server, you are a good man Marwolf. On the other hand, Matt isn’t.</p>

<p>Dang your stupid.</p>
<p>PP2P has been up more then 10 months, more then 1 year actually.</p>
<p>I have been doing ‘discounts’ ever since I started it.</p>
<p>and the shoutbox, someone gave me the link to.</p>
<p>And number 3, is probably complete bullshit. lol.</p>

<p>I don’t really get where you’re going with this…  But I know what companies do with real businesses, and that’s not really the issue here, it’s the fact that Matt is exhibiting several antisocial behaviors and by the looks of it has no intention to stop, which is not good for the rsc pserver community as a whole.  I’ve heard that people have left the rsc scene because of it, and refuse to play another server due to the abuse (I know it’s not hard evidence, but I’m sure I can track some people down who have quit the rsc scene due to Matt to give you first hand statements if needed).  And that right there takes away from the enjoyment of everyone, because everyone that plays interacts with each other and that makes the game, it’s not just about the game, it’s about the people, because without people the game would be nothing.  If Matt is allowed to continue advertising here he is going to continue driving new players, as well as current players away, and possibly for good, which isn’t good for anyone.</p>

<p>To file a chargeback, simply search for “file dispute”.  Then, it should ask you to enter a case id, but if u click the button to find case id,<br>
u can navigate to the transaction in which you sent money to matt. click this transaction and then click next, and tell them why. (virtual item was not received).</p>
<p>in the future, if you are going to donate, you now know that he plans on doing whipes in order to make more money for himself as this is his only way of making money.</p>

<p>In watching what goes on, I have noticed Project P2P appears to be very observant of DARScape. These things were original and I only learned of the similarity when visiting Project P2P’s website.</p>
<p>These are my reasons for thinking that:<br>
1.) They chose to use the exact same shoutbox service as we have been using for years. (DARscape was previously a RSC and then a RS2 clan) (Cbox.ws) (No other servers use this exact service, nor the same color scheme)</p>
<p>2.) They do discounts on donations in order to “make ends meet.” We have off and on for the last 10 months had discount rates on donations for gifts. (2x rate) (Our policy is different - you don’t buy rares, you donate and receive a gift for donating - gifting is fairly legal, selling intellectual property is not)</p>
<p>3.) I have received a fair share of donations over a period of months, no where as much, but a good amount. I was out of work due to family reasons and thus could devote myself full time to the game development. My rationale was this: I work full time on this and what is left after the bills, I use on my bills. Sounds fair right? I was devoting my time as a full time developer and isn’t that what real businesses do? Their CEOs don’t work pro-bono. The sad reality was that I actually was spending a bit more out of my own pocket than donations were coming in so overall there was a net loss and not a profit, although I mostly broke even.</p>
<p>There are additional similarities in things I’ve seen which leads me to believe Project P2P emulates DARScape, but I have to leave for class.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t really get where you’re going with this…  But I know what companies do with real businesses, and that’s not really the issue here, it’s the fact that Matt is exhibiting several antisocial behaviors and by the looks of it has no intention to stop, which is not good for the rsc pserver community as a whole.  I’ve heard that people have left the rsc scene because of it, and refuse to play another server due to the abuse (I know it’s not hard evidence, but I’m sure I can track some people down who have quit the rsc scene due to Matt to give you first hand statements if needed).  And that right there takes away from the enjoyment of everyone, because everyone that plays interacts with each other and that makes the game, it’s not just about the game, it’s about the people, because without people the game would be nothing.  If Matt is allowed to continue advertising here he is going to continue driving new players, as well as current players away, and possibly for good, which isn’t good for anyone.</p>

<p>Matt you have no right to call any of us immature. PP2P is your only way of making money, you don’t even have a job.  Every day, players donate to you because you threaten that the server will go down if they don’t get enough donations.  Your lucky you can sit behind a computer, because i’m positive you wouldn’t be scamming people if you weren’t hiding behind the internet. But anyway, thanks for telling me his name Chrix, “Matthew Whitton”?</p>

<p>I believe we can all agree on this single point: Matt’s “scam” lies in the fact that he asks for donations and in return gives players items. The player’s motivation in donating is to obtain the items/levels. Matt realizes that the server is imbalanced and/or the flow of donations slows to a crawl and he needs money. He then wipes the database/bans the accounts that obtain too much of something. He then resumes accepting donations with the full knowledge that the items/levels he delivers to donors will be removed and not returned.</p>
<p>If there were honest issues which resulted in database wipes/player bans, then Matt would issue replacement items/levels to all who had donated. Database backups can be made to obtain records, I do mine daily. His gmail account contains every Paypal transaction, his Paypal account contains every donor email. Replacements could be easily done, yet he does not do this. This “scheme” apparently has been repeated 2 or more times so far and has the potential to continue. When the donation flow slows down, does the database get wiped? When it slowed for me, I increased the maximum levels to 125, and then again to 150 but stopped. Each increase brought on a large increase in donations before slowing down again.</p>

because it is you. Anyways, I’m done with this immature nonsense.</p>
<p>Have fun guys lol<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Matt you have no right to call any of us immature. PP2P is your only way of making money, you don’t even have a job.  Every day, players donate to you because you threaten that the server will go down if they don’t get enough donations.  Your lucky you can sit behind a computer, because i’m positive you wouldn’t be scamming people if you weren’t hiding behind the internet. But anyway, thanks for telling me his name Chrix, “Matthew Whitton”?[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes his name is Matthew Whitton, and you are welcome.</p>
