    <title>Project P2P - DO NOT PLAY THIS SERVER!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-p2p-do-not-play-this-server/296286</link>
    <description>Why oh why do people still support this server. You people are donating so much money per person and funding this business. Matt, the owner is a lazy fucking disgrace to my country (Canada). Get a job you lazy fuck. He lies to the players, takes advantage of their donations, bans/abuses for his own excitment. Get a fuckin job. A real job like many other people instead of Scamming helpless people into this trap.

He recently hired a Coder to code for him because he knows nothing, and after this person was finished he abandoned him.

Many times have I heard of people being banned/abused for nothing. Many times players have gotten banned after donating large sums of money. Why is this server still up? There is so much evidence that matt is a pig.

Please do not close this topic, it is not an advertisement but I feel people should be aware of what they are getting into if they ever should chose to be a part of this community

because it is you. Anyways, I’m done with this immature nonsense.</p>
<p>Have fun guys lol<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Matt you have no right to call any of us immature. PP2P is your only way of making money, you don’t even have a job.  Every day, players donate to you because you threaten that the server will go down if they don’t get enough donations.  Your lucky you can sit behind a computer, because i’m positive you wouldn’t be scamming people if you weren’t hiding behind the internet. But anyway, thanks for telling me his name Chrix, “Matthew Whitton”?[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes his name is Matthew Whitton, and you are welcome.</p>

<p>Disputing donations will result in failure. I have had “quitters” dispute donations and to this day, I have won every dispute.</p>
<p>Based on the posts earlier in this topic:</p>
<p>I believe we can all agree on this single point: Matt’s “scam” lies in the fact that he asks for donations and in return gives players items. The player’s motivation in donating is to obtain the items/levels. Matt realizes that the server is imbalanced and/or the flow of donations slows to a crawl and he needs money. He then wipes the database/bans the accounts that obtain too much of something. He then resumes accepting donations with the full knowledge that the items/levels he delivers to donors will be removed and not returned.</p>
<p>If there were honest issues which resulted in database wipes/player bans, then Matt would issue replacement items/levels to all who had donated. Database backups can be made to obtain records, I do mine daily. His gmail account contains every Paypal transaction, his Paypal account contains every donor email. Replacements could be easily done, yet he does not do this. This “scheme” apparently has been repeated 2 or more times so far and has the potential to continue. When the donation flow slows down, does the database get wiped? When it slowed for me, I increased the maximum levels to 125, and then again to 150 but stopped. Each increase brought on a large increase in donations before slowing down again.</p>
<p>King PK died when the Administrator ran with the server donations, did it not? Poor administration there, what about in this case?</p>
<p>The question comes down to: do we support this money making scheme on this forum or do we allow it to continue?[/quote]</p>
<p>That is correct, but if enough people attempt to file a chargeback, his paypal account will very likely be investigated and/or frozen for all the complaints/scams.</p>

<p>an interesting idea would be to stop donating for a while. let’s see what he does… besides, he does have more than enough money to pay for the hosting, so there’s no reason for him to take it down <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>BTW again, nice cop out…</p>
<p>[quote=“CodeForFame, post:101, topic:291361”]That is the biggest cop out, you know I’m right, and you shouldn’t be allowed to advertise or even own a server.  You know damn well what you’re doing is wrong, and any sane human being knows it’s wrong.  And this is exactly why people like you need to be blacklisted from the rsc community.</p>
<p>Mods, please post if you need further proof, and what proof needs to be given if any more than is already here.[/quote]</p>

<p>Matt you have no right to call any of us immature. PP2P is your only way of making money, you don’t even have a job.  Every day, players donate to you because you threaten that the server will go down if they don’t get enough donations.  Your lucky you can sit behind a computer, because i’m positive you wouldn’t be scamming people if you weren’t hiding behind the internet. But anyway, thanks for telling me his name Chrix, “Matthew Whitton”?</p>

<p>I don’t really get where you’re going with this…  But I know what companies do with real businesses, and that’s not really the issue here, it’s the fact that Matt is exhibiting several antisocial behaviors and by the looks of it has no intention to stop, which is not good for the rsc pserver community as a whole.  I’ve heard that people have left the rsc scene because of it, and refuse to play another server due to the abuse (I know it’s not hard evidence, but I’m sure I can track some people down who have quit the rsc scene due to Matt to give you first hand statements if needed).  And that right there takes away from the enjoyment of everyone, because everyone that plays interacts with each other and that makes the game, it’s not just about the game, it’s about the people, because without people the game would be nothing.  If Matt is allowed to continue advertising here he is going to continue driving new players, as well as current players away, and possibly for good, which isn’t good for anyone.</p>

<p>To file a chargeback, simply search for “file dispute”.  Then, it should ask you to enter a case id, but if u click the button to find case id,<br>
u can navigate to the transaction in which you sent money to matt. click this transaction and then click next, and tell them why. (virtual item was not received).</p>
<p>in the future, if you are going to donate, you now know that he plans on doing whipes in order to make more money for himself as this is his only way of making money.</p>

<p>Dang your stupid.</p>
<p>PP2P has been up more then 10 months, more then 1 year actually.</p>
<p>I have been doing ‘discounts’ ever since I started it.</p>
<p>and the shoutbox, someone gave me the link to.</p>
<p>And number 3, is probably complete bullshit. lol.</p>

<p>These are my reasons for thinking that:<br>
1.) They chose to use the exact same shoutbox service as we have been using for years. (DARscape was previously a RSC and then a RS2 clan) (Cbox.ws) (No other servers use this exact service, nor the same color scheme)</p>
<p>2.) They do discounts on donations in order to “make ends meet.” We have off and on for the last 10 months had discount rates on donations for gifts. (2x rate) (Our policy is different - you don’t buy rares, you donate and receive a gift for donating - gifting is fairly legal, selling intellectual property is not)</p>
<p>3.) I have received a fair share of donations over a period of months, no where as much, but a good amount. I was out of work due to family reasons and thus could devote myself full time to the game development. My rationale was this: I work full time on this and what is left after the bills, I use on my bills. Sounds fair right? I was devoting my time as a full time developer and isn’t that what real businesses do? Their CEOs don’t work pro-bono. The sad reality was that I actually was spending a bit more out of my own pocket than donations were coming in so overall there was a net loss and not a profit, although I mostly broke even.</p>
<p>There are additional similarities in things I’ve seen which leads me to believe Project P2P emulates DARScape, but I have to leave for class.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alot alike? Never. I’ve played your server, you are a good man Marwolf. On the other hand, Matt isn’t.</p>

<p>Oh and btw, you said it was the very last days of pp2p, like… 2 months ago?</p>

<p>You won’t get to me Matt, your maturity is way up there bro. -.-</p>
<p>The last days of P2P have been here for a couple of months, it’s not me nor probably anyone else taking your server down, it’s your own stupidity.</p>
<p>If you still refuse to listen to ANYONE else, and continue making enemies out of people you should be giving respect to, you won’t have to worry about anyone getting at you or your server, Karma should take care of it.</p>
<p>GL Matt.</p>
<p>Edit** Matthew, I did not create “mattsqueer” so stop trying to justify somebody elses immaturity on my behalf.  Any normal person would let you get away or just stand aside while you rob people, but I will not.</p>
<p>You change your Paypal address every time you whipe, so you don’t have to deal with people taking the money back or you getting into any legal trouble, it will catch up to you.</p>
