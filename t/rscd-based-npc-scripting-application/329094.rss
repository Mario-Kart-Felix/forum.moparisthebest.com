    <title>RSCD Based Npc Scripting Application</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscd-based-npc-scripting-application/329094</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s a new project that I started a few days ago for generating Npc Handlers.
The overall goal of this application was to create a way for people with no programming experience to make rudimentary Npc handling routines.

[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh3uLfI4UqY]View Demo Here[/url]

To Do:
*Fill the toolbox with more logical controls, and code insertion controls
*Write methods for storing / loading scripts onto the HD
*Include java syntax checking on the custom code module
*Advanced input validation (is the user using key words?)
*Java syntax highlighting (custom code module)
*Complete the script testing environment
*Make a professional UI instead of the &#39;diagnostic&#39; view it&#39;s in now.

There&#39;s a chance that when I retire from the scene, I&#39;ll release a tool-pack containing the various projects that I&#39;ve made in the past few months.

Any suggestions for toolbox entries are welcomed.

come on genius, show me how much easier/user friendly it can get. This is your chance to impress me and gain some respect as this is a worthy question, instead of you gaining epeen by pasting code snippets or screenshots all over this board, especially with your reputation of copy/pasting/photoshopping.[/quote]None of my shit is actually photoshopped, you can ask mapu and some other kiddies, everything what i do gets realsed to people i no. its a shame i don’t think gaining respect from you is on my top TODO list. and yes i have made it more user friendly when i was actually bored. gosh heres the thing xEnt no one needs to gain respect of anyone just because you say so, you and rsc private servers are actually nothing to me its funny that you think it does</p>

<p>Thats mainly because no one in the community cared to try. Rsca scripting is fine, although I would prefer the use of String arrays(which can still be implemented if you chose too, just as easily as using it the way it was meant to be used).</p>

<p>We intend on doing every quest, even RSCA members struggled with xEnt’s simple scripting language so Zilent wanted to make it literally fool proof. I was nagging him to make a scripting engine for ages but this opens up more doors tbh. If the application allows you to do something then it will compile and work as intended (that’s the plan anyway). We want to be able to hand the application out and just let 'em go wild. As long as it’s all the talking done we can just do the rest manual (as there’s no point in making the NPCScripter do it if it’s only a one-off quest situation for example).</p>
<p>I agree it’s overkill if we were just using for a select few NPC’s but we want to use it to completely replicate every quest (or at least a large chunk of them) and this will make it a lot easier.</p>
<p>I logged into RSC and decided to replicate the bankers 100% and came up with this in under 30 seconds (no exaggeration what-so-ever):</p>

<p>This is the <em>entire</em> code. I realise you make it easier with a GUI, but doing that also limits what people can actually do with NPCs and makes it harder for you to edit the code to make it do what you want.[/quote]Tbh, looking over the RSCD how they handle npc talking and such with delays or how yours are doing it, its just retarded.</p>

Would’ve been easier to rewrite NPCHandlers imo, but gj.<br>
[/quote]<br>
We intend on doing every quest, even RSCA members struggled with xEnt’s simple scripting language so Zilent wanted to make it literally fool proof. I was nagging him to make a scripting engine for ages but this opens up more doors tbh. If the application allows you to do something then it will compile and work as intended (that’s the plan anyway). We want to be able to hand the application out and just let 'em go wild. As long as it’s all the talking done we can just do the rest manual (as there’s no point in making the NPCScripter do it if it’s only a one-off quest situation for example).</p>
<p>I agree it’s overkill if we were just using for a select few NPC’s but we want to use it to completely replicate every quest (or at least a large chunk of them) and this will make it a lot easier.</p>
<p>I logged into RSC and decided to replicate the bankers 100% and came up with this in under 30 seconds (no exaggeration what-so-ever):</p>
