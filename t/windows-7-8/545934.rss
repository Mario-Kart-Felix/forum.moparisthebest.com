    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/windows-7-8/545934</link>
    <description>So I like windows 8 and all but will windows 7 run my games faster?

Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 1-2
Just cause 1
Mission against terror
Test drive unlimited 1-2
and also, My movies when I download my movie lags when mopar or facebook is up in the background it lags

I have allot more problems but that&#39;ll take me forever to type all of them in lol

Things I like about windows 8 the lock screen, the tiles, and thats basically it I love windows 7 so should I downgrade for better gaming?</description>

              <p>It’s possible your card manufacturer didn’t have a windows 8 driver at the time, so ‘updating’ did nothing. What card do you have? It’s also possible you had the wrong java version, which didn’t allow the lwjgl libraries to hook in natively, etc. It’s not a problem with windows 8, plenty of people have it working fine there.</p>

Windows 8 is a joke, if you want to be able to play about every game with no problems, use windows 7<br>
[/quote]I’ve had no problem running any games on Windows 8. That’s like saying “windows 7 is a joke, if you want to play about every game use windows 95” because there might be games that wont run on XP+.</p>

<p>This. But a lot of the time, the manufacturer will only support Windows 7 and not Windows 8, so there’s no drivers for a specific device, that usually happens with laptops. For example, I upgraded my laptop from Vista to Windows 7 immediately as I got it… HP only supports drivers for Vista (why? Who enjoys Vista?)</p>

              <p>No. Windows 8 is actually faster than windows 7. You should only downgrade if you really cant stand the tiles and start screen. It sounds like you enjoy those, so you have no reason to downgrade.</p>
