    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-how-to-compile-make-your-own-ircd-server-unrealircd/340848</link>
    <description>[b]Note:[/b] Other places posted: http://wiki.swiftirc.net/index.php?title=Installing_UnrealIRCd_on_linux for proof check the bottom by &#39;Natha&#39; and on my forums, http://www.GuruForums.net

This article will demonstrate an UnrealIRCd [v3.2.7] install on a Linux-based system. 

[b]Note:[/b] This guide uses UnrealIRCd [v3.2.7], which is not the latest version available at the moment. If you want to use another version, navigate to the UnrealIRCd downloads page and download the latest version. Make sure to replace all instances of &quot;3.2.7&quot; in this guide with the version you are using. 


Download UnrealIRCd [v3.2.7] to your system from here. 


Now we will need to extract it. Use the command below. 
 
[code]tar -zxvf Unreal3.2.7.tar.gz[/code]

Now we need to open the file. We can do this by using the command below. since we have extracted it, .tar.gz does NOT need placing in the code. Again if you have another version, please replace it with yours. 
 cd Unreal3.2.7

We are now in the UnrealIRCd Directory, we are going to configure it now, you can do this by using the command below. 
 
[code]./Config[/code]

Questions will start flowing. Don&#39;t worry just follow these steps. 
 Do you want to enable the server anti-spoof protection?
 [No] -&gt;

Just press enter, this doesn&#39;t need to be enabled. 
 
[code]What directory are all the server configuration files in?
 [/usr/local/username/Unreal3.2.7/] -&gt; [/code]

The directory hasn&#39;t changed so just press enter. 
 
[code]What is the path to the ircd binary including the name of the binary?
 [/usr/local/username/Unreal3.2/src/ircd] -&gt;[/code]

You guessed it, Enter. 
 
[code]Would you like to compile as a hub or as a leaf?
 Type Hub to select hub and Leaf to select leaf.
 [Hub] -&gt; [/code]

If you&#39;re not planning to link your server just press enter, if you are or are thinking about linking in the future, you may want to type Leaf and press enter. 
 
[code]What is the hostname of the server running your IRCd?
 [example.swiftirc.net] -&gt; [/code]

Press enter again. 
 
[code]What should the default permissions for your configuration files be? (Set this to 0 to disable)
 It is strongly recommended that you use 0600 to prevent unwanted reading of the file
 [0600] - &gt; [/code]

Press enter again. 
 
[code]Do you want to support SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connections?
 [No] -&gt; [/code]

Press enter again. 
 
[code]Do you want to enable IPv6 support?
 [No] -&gt; [/code]

Type Yes. Because you need IPv6 enabled to link your ircd with services. 
 
[code]Do you want to enable ziplinks support?
 [No] -&gt; [/code]

Press enter. 
 
[code]Do you want to enable remote includes?
 [No] -&gt; [/code]

Press enter. 
 
[code]Do you want to enable prefixes for chanadmin and chanowner?
 This will give +a the &amp; prefix and ~ for +q (just like +o is @)
 Supported by the major clients (mIRC, xchat, epic, eggdrop, Klient, PJIRC, etc.) with the notable exceptions of irssi, KVIrc and CGI:IRC.
 This feature should be enabled/disabled network-wide.
 [No] -&gt; [/code]

Right, now this is up to you. Do you want three ranks or more? If you want your owner and ops to all use @, halfops +h and voices +v, you can just press enter. But if you instead want owner to use ~, admins &amp;, ops @, halfop % and voice + type yes and press enter. 
 
[code]What listen() backlog value do you wish to use? Some older servers
 have problems with more than 5, others work fine with many more.
 [5] -&gt; [/code]

Press enter 

[code]How far back do you want to keep the nickname history?
 [2000] -&gt; [/code]

Press enter 
 
[code]What is the maximum sendq length you wish to have?
 [3000000] -&gt; [/code]

Press enter 
 
[code]How many buffer pools would you like?
 This number will be multiplied by MAXSENDQLENGTH.
 [18] -&gt;[/code]

Press enter 
 
[code]How many file descriptors (or sockets) can the IRCd use?
 [1024] -&gt;[/code]

Enter again. 
 
[code]Would you like any more parameters to configure?
 Write them here:
 [] -&gt; [/code]

And enter again, this isn&#39;t really needed. 

After it has finished compiling you will need to type make and then press enter. Let it compile. When that&#39;s done you will receive further instructions on what to do next. 

Compile is now complete. You should now read the documentation and learn how to configure your IRCd. 

After you have edited your unrealircd.conf you should be ready to start the server.
