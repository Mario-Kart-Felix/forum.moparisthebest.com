<p>from client.java you could simply call functions or methods that are declared public and static like this:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">commands.functionname();</code></pre>

<p>that is assuming your other class is named commands <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
