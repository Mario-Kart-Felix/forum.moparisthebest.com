    <description>I am a statistics type of guy here is the layout for the past few years. Before you post something like this &quot;this is stupid&quot; please just read through the thread itself and still try to provide whatever feedback you would like to. I thought about these for a good hour before I posted and I just wanted to see where the community stands itself in others eyes.

What will this mean in the upcoming years? 

Look at the new topics..in the early years of mopar we had nearly 100k posts every time then it dwindled. I assume that was spam bots or just the birth of rsps communities in general? ( I wasn&#39;t on here at this time so I can only assume.) It is only May and we already have 66% ish of the same topics as last year. What is the cause of this ? (besides leechers asking for help lol)

Look at the new posts...we are only at about 30% ish as we were last year? Does this mean we aren&#39;t assisting people in learning how to program? What is the cause of such a drastic change? Are we just blandly dead at the moment? How can we improve this?

Over the years we have seen an overall decrease in new memberships to the site, even though I&#39;m sure several of us moparians have to be blamed for having multiple accounts,..but now all of a sudden we are seeing an increase in membership? Is this the cause of first time posters posting adverts? Or what is the real root cause?

I&#39;m not sure what to think about most online really. It seems to fluctuate quite a lot. This I assume is due to timezone, economy and etc.</description>

              <p>Well here is just my opinion.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The foundation of servers needs to be more stable. Using the same BS generic coding then adding 4 or 5 areas for people to gain 50k xp every time they do 1 damage is just dumb and will not promote a healthy server. I am not saying you need to write your own base, but all servers should not look the same as their base plus a few extras. An example of this was on a popular 2006 remake server, who had no idea that barrows was half functional and was giving barrows pieces until sets of the armors had been obtained and only a select few knew it worked and it caused a massive uproar in the community, all because they didn’t know the base. Stuff like this should not happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maturity within the staff department of all servers needs to be increased dramatically. I have seen far too many bans for the most stupid stuff, especially when someone doesn’t agree with what a mod or admin thinks. I know there are some out there who can be reasonable staff, they just need to step up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enough with the pure PvP, pk in 5 seconds BS. This just causes instability as well. If you’re going to make a PvP server, then amp up the xp rates a bit and make bossing the main form of gathering gear. Then add a pk point system that offers extended gear or hell even just aesthetics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happened to that brilliant idea of a zombie survival based game? It had a great theme going and could have had a great statistics, challenge, and loot system. It’s a shame no one ever stood up and took on the challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ECONOMY, ECONOMY, ECONOMY. Why do half the servers have broken ass economies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broken AI. Coders need to start testing their releases before they make them publicly known to the community. Look at</p>

              <p>RS activity as a whole has dropped. People just aren’t interested in RS anymore. That plus most of the original group of Moparscapers have left or become inactivity due to real life, including a lot of very talented coders. Which brings me to the fact that most of the servers are very lacking and don’t appeal to most players anymore. A lot of it is BS pking, which is pointless now because EoC has armour for such a cheap price and such that they can’t justify spending time on a game that won’t be saved or remembered, whereas RS stats stay forever. Not to mention that Jagex has cracked down on RSPS apparently, causing most people to avoid them and be very wary. Plus people assume that all RSPS have viruses if they’ve never experienced one before.</p>
<p>If we had much more reliable servers that were focused on giving players a stable environment with a safe and secure way of playing, rather than focusing on maximizing profits and allowing most of their staff to abuse their powers, we could definitely rebuild the community. However this would require moderators to be willing to regulate what kind of servers are posted and advertised.</p>

<p>[quote author=Davidi2 link=topic=636992.msg4294796#msg4294796 date=1368033749]I wouldn’t be surprised if we passed 2012 (or at least got close). I’d say we get ‘dead’ (like <a href="http://MITB.com">MITB.com</a>) within 5 years</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Part of the reason that mitb is dead is because mscp was only ever intended for private servers and that isn’t the case any more. The more recent decline of mitb can be attributed to some active members being banned along with mscp getting more general discussion related sections, not to mention the fact that Avail blatantly stole the mitb games section and didn’t make a new one. The games section of mitb was probably the most active section.</p>
<p>It’s not a case of mitb died, the active userbase was forced to switch to mscp.[/quote]I was merely giving an example as to the ‘type’ of dead I meant – a few posts made per week. Not saying it would die in the same way or for any of the same reasons <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>as a person who came to the forum originally when mitb was still fairly active I can see where you are coming from actually. When we made homewoerk help and etc it ruined the point of having different forums. Originally moparscape was as you said just another forum entirely for a specific cause but over time for some reason it just changed.</p>

              <p>There are several factors as to why the years 2006 and 2007 are misleading from a purely statistical standpoint. First and foremost: mitb already had a huge and existing user base from ex-kaitnieks members. Secondly: the site saw a huge amount of traffic from people seeking the aryan bot, again, a lot of this traffic was from ex-kaitnieks patrons as well. Thirdly: 2007 saw a huge private server boom, after many, many people were banned from using aryan they had quit official runescape and many of them had taken up playing on private servers. The year 2007 is especially misleading because forum policy changed heavily, before the server status page people would post advertisements for servers on the forums which <span class="bbcode-b">greatly</span> inflated the number of posts, threads and users.</p>
<p>Also try to keep in mind that many of the people active in 2006-2007 that were carried over from kaitnieks simply would have lost interest, kaitnieks was a good <span class="bbcode-b">8 years ago</span> now, that’s an awful long time to stick around for a largely non-existent cheating scene.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Part of the reason that mitb is dead is because mscp was only ever intended for private servers and that isn’t the case any more. The more recent decline of mitb can be attributed to some active members being banned along with mscp getting more general discussion related sections, not to mention the fact that Avail blatantly stole the mitb games section and didn’t make a new one. The games section of mitb was probably the most active section.</p>
<p>It’s not a case of mitb died, the active userbase was forced to switch to mscp.</p>

This forum will start to really die out within the next year, and it already started. There’s a lot of the regular ‘veteran’ members who don’t come on anymore. Most of our sections are going idle, and we are the same old MoparScape<br>
