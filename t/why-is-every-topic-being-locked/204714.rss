    <title>Why is every topic being locked?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-is-every-topic-being-locked/204714</link>
    <description>Guys, well, new moderators, ease it up with the locking. Half of the topics that have been locked in the RS2 server tutorial board shouldn&#39;t be locked.

I mean, they can&#39;t post Java tutorials, they can&#39;t post teaching tutorials, they can&#39;t post copy and paste tutorials (I agree), they can&#39;t post any tutorials. One in particular was locked, and it was a well written tutorial, explaining the Graphics method, why?</description>

<p>Greeny, continuing your post:</p>
<blockquote>[21:21] TeleNubby: Could I ask
[21:21] TeleNubby: Why ``jason was a good choice?
[21:22] Niall: looking back I don't know why I nominated him in the first place, but he has a good attitude and as long as he can lock topics for being in the wrong place he'll do
[21:23] TeleNubby: thats true but
[21:23] TeleNubby: have you noticed
[21:23] TeleNubby: his first REAL post on MSCP was after he got mod?
[21:24] Niall: I noticed a few posts, I don't expect him to be like Yz85 and spew out really helpful posts, I just expect him to lock a few topics here and there to relieve the load on other mods 
[21:25] TeleNubby: alrighty then
[21:25] TeleNubby: but I might add
[21:25] TeleNubby: a few staff members are a lil' iffy on that
[21:28] Niall: I might regret it, but no one is denying that mscp needs mods
[21:29] TeleNubby: alright
[21:29] TeleNubby: its youre choice in the end
[21:29] Niall: the only real damage he can do is delete/move a load of topics and edit a load of posts, the former can be fixed in a few seconds</blockquote>
<p>Also, isnt it a good thing the rules are actually being enforced for a first time?</p>

              <p>Why? Because majority of the other mods are complete morons. It’s almost like the staff spin a bottle and pick the idiot who it lands on. Jason is a prime example of this. Though i have nothing against him as a person, he is completely unfit for this staff position. Why? He was banned from irc for abusing another irc network and begging for an award of some sorts. That was the day before his got his powers. Excellent choice there.</p>
<p>Staff members should be chosen for their moderating ability, maturity and knowledge. It seems that the admins forget that. You wonder why this community fails.</p>

              <p>I am aware of that, but I still think if it teaches how to utilize the Java language, and provides a way and why it should be used in the server, I have no problem with it. Half of the ones I went through were teaching tutorials, and they were locked.</p>

              <p>Guys, well, new moderators, ease it up with the locking. Half of the topics that have been locked in the RS2 server tutorial board shouldn’t be locked.</p>
<p>I mean, they can’t post Java tutorials, they can’t post teaching tutorials, they can’t post copy and paste tutorials (I agree), they can’t post any tutorials. One in particular was locked, and it was a well written tutorial, explaining the Graphics method, why?</p>
