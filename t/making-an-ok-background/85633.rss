    <title>Making an ok background</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-an-ok-background/85633</link>
    <description>I&#39;m gonna just write this up, no pictures sorry but I&#39;m not on my computer with my graphic tools on it.

[step 0]
Find a nice stock, preferably with alot of things in it, like an action scene, resize it as you wish and duplicate it.

[step 1]
Select the smudge tool and find a nice splatter brush to smudge with and apply some nice scatter and other settings to the brush to give it style, and smudge the 2[sup]nd[/sup] layer (the duplicated layer)

[step 2]
Set the layer to different opacitys to make it somewhat blendable and apply a gradient map that is the exact oposite color of the origional stock and make it bright. Duplicate the first layer again and do the same thing, but choose a different brush and a different color.. Do this step continously until you find the perfect effects for your piece of art.

[step 3]
You may notice that the whole thing probably clashes by now because you probably have a dull colored stock and a bunch of bright colors everywhere over it. What you do now is apply image, add a few nice filters and erase what looks bad, preferably you want to bring the colored layers back, so erase some of whats infront of them and then add a gradient map on the image and make it blue-ish. You want the colors to be bright, but not too bright.. you don&#39;t want it to hurt peoples eyes when they look at it, so you apply image and add a warming filter/cooling filter to dim it down a little bit and add a few effects to make the illusion of depth.

[step 4]
If your making something with an image you should have added a render/sprite awhile ago or about now would be good, but if you just added it.. I would suggest doing the above steps again.

I don&#39;t feel like typing anymore.. Tell me if you want me to add something or not because I don&#39;t feel like thinking about the steps. It would be easier if I had photoshop open.</description>
