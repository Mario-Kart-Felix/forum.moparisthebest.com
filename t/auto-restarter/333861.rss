i want to make a auto restarter for it because every 10 minutes it shuts off and it annoies me because nobody is joining and staying on because of that so if someone could help me with this i would very much appreciate it and i know that there is a voule auto restarter in the files but it does not work for me and i saw a auto restarter in one source that was in the runserver.bat so if anyone knows that it would really help me out thank you</description>
