    <title>Fixing the whole/gap in the jaw/face on my players</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixing-the-whole-gap-in-the-jaw-face-on-my-players/196714</link>
    <description>Well, I have my own code I used. (Please don&#39;t flame this Topic. Oh and I did add it in Player.java above 5 arrays, still didn&#39;t work.) I&#39;m also using PimpScape as my source.

[code=c]if (!Item.isFullMask(playerEquipment[playerHat])
                    &amp;&amp; (playerLook[0] != 1)) {
                playerProps.writeWord(0x100 + pBeard);
            } // Beard
            else {
                playerProps.writeByte(0);
            }
        } else {
            playerProps.writeWord(-1);
            playerProps.writeWord(npcId);
	    }[/code]

Now, before you say &quot;remove the bracket at the end&quot; I already did. Without it there, I get 100 errors. With it there, I get none (in the compiler) when I run the server and log-in my player is spacing out.(all glitchy). Now, I&#39;m not a &quot;noob&quot; coder. I&#39;m an average coder. So I know what I&#39;m doing most of the time on this common-sense stuff. If anyone can help, thanks.</description>
