[b][size=14pt]About the server:[/size][/b][/left]
Welcome to the Vulcan development thread, the server is based off Hyperion by Graham.  I have decided to make the switch to as I write content faster because I have used it for a good solid two years now on and off.  I also like the stability compared to WL (lol not even a comparison) it also follows programming conventions so I will not get headaches when I start to program on the source.

No no no no no, he’s thinking the same as I am. Pwnd is an old-time mitber, none of them care about RSPS really so it’s a rare moment when you see someone from that long ago actually offer themselves to an RSPS.</p>

              <p>Alright here are some updates guys.  I have decided to port everything over to Hyperion because I can not stand the lack of conventions in WinterLove server bases.  So with this being said I have wrote up a trade base last night here is some media of it:<br>

<img src="http://puu.sh/3PXCf.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/3PXEV.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I have completed the ground item system that I started working on last night also, there is some problems with it but they are not huge problems the only problem I have encountered was when you come back into a region or a new player enters the region the items that were once deleted reappear. I should have fixed it now so it’s out of the way.<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/3Qgnv.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/3QgoA.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I’m now going to start on the shopping system and finishing up the npc &amp; player masks and do the npc spawning etc etc.  Should have a couple more updates within a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Never said different is bad I just said I don’t know how it would react to the rsps ‘scene’.  Anyways I do agree being unique is a good way to go and i’m thinking I will give some of your ideas ago.</p>

<p>Wow… Looks horible in my opinion, because of The FEATURES has not been displayed</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So you will judge a project by the lack of a list of features?  There is not much to say about the features quite yet because there isn’t much.  Client features: 459 look a like game-frame, cache packed interfaces and loading 474 data.  Server features: entity based combat (thanks nick), nio networking, basic skill outline done and basic features like food and potions.</p>
<p>Anyways ontopic:  Updated the thread a little bit with credits and so forth.  I will begin developing skills when I get back from work/the gym as I have my new computer all set up and i’m not going to the beach again today lol.</p>
<p>Edit:  Starting to gather information on how to clip projectiles.</p>
