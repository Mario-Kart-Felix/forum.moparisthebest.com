    <title>When Accusing one of Theft</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/when-accusing-one-of-theft/249004</link>
    <description>If you think someone is stealing someone else&#39;s work, do *not* be the hero and try to tell them off for it. In most cases, you and the person who is &#39;stealing the work&#39; will be equally punished, so don&#39;t try it. Instead, report the person with proof that they are stealing and/or pm a moderator. You do not get special privileges to flame/spam someone even if they are breaking the rules. Bear this in mind the next time you think someone is stealing someone else&#39;s work.</description>
