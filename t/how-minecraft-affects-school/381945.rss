    <title>How Minecraft affects school</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-minecraft-affects-school/381945</link>
    <description>Ok, so for english, we had to do a paper about a literary approach, and use a metaphor to grasp the idea. Here is my paper.


[b][center]A Literary Approach[/center][/b]

 

     A literary approach is something that is essential to understanding a novel and being able to interpret text in multiple views. A literary approach can be compared to the layers of the earth. As you continue to go deeper, you may find more interesting things, find it harder to continue digging, or probably lava. When you begin a novel, it is important to know the approach you will be taking, whether you want to skim the outside layers, then come back, or go straight down into it and work your way out. Some books may be treated like the dirt of the earth. They are easy to get out, and don&#39;t require much thought. Other books may be stone, which takes some time to work through and will require a more in depth style of thought. Other books, however, may be the core, filled with lava, and you&#39;ll have to selectively work around the stone in order to not get completely scorched in it. These things should always be expected when opening a book, for an 800 page novel could turn out to be just a thin layer of dirt. 

     The main part of having a literary approach is to interpret a novel in a view that may not be your own. Taking on a simpler view of the text will allow you to get in just the essence of what is going on. Taking on a philosophical view could leave you asking yourself many questions, even a simple &quot;why?&quot;. Taking different approaches on a text will continue to broaden your view of the text, which could lead to opening different doors to what you may believe to be the &quot;true&quot; meaning of the text. However, this may not be the &quot;true&quot; meaning of the text, just your different approach on it. It all just depends on your ultimate approach on the novel.

     The reader, author and the text itself all play an important role in the understanding of a novel. The author writes the book not only from their approach, but from their feeling and emotions, of what they truly believe so much that it must be comprised all into a novel, and whether that message is direct or hidden in the text, from the authors point of view, it&#39;s there. The role of the read has an infinite amount of approaches, as an infinite number of people may read the book, each with multiple views on it. The reader may also share this view with other people, such as a critic. While this critic may state their approach on the book and what they believe is the true meaning, it is still their view. The final view, and sometimes the most confusing, is what is comprised in the text itself. The clues to what is in the text can often be found in things like the grammar, punctuation and the word play. Combining these can allow you to see what is the ultimate &quot;unbiased&quot; viewpoint, that is completely ignoring what the reader and the author believe, but what is truly comprised in the text that may lay before you. Using these three point of views, you can get an unbelievable understanding of the book, but it is important to remember that, while you think you might have struck diamonds on this digging expedition, there are plenty more approaches out there to be uncovered.</description>

              <p>Ok, so for english, we had to do a paper about a literary approach, and use a metaphor to grasp the idea. Here is my paper.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[center]A Literary Approach[/center]</span></p>
<pre><code> A literary approach is something that is essential to understanding a novel and being able to interpret text in multiple views. A literary approach can be compared to the layers of the earth. As you continue to go deeper, you may find more interesting things, find it harder to continue digging, or probably lava. When you begin a novel, it is important to know the approach you will be taking, whether you want to skim the outside layers, then come back, or go straight down into it and work your way out. Some books may be treated like the dirt of the earth. They are easy to get out, and don't require much thought. Other books may be stone, which takes some time to work through and will require a more in depth style of thought. Other books, however, may be the core, filled with lava, and you'll have to selectively work around the stone in order to not get completely scorched in it. These things should always be expected when opening a book, for an 800 page novel could turn out to be just a thin layer of dirt. 

 The main part of having a literary approach is to interpret a novel in a view that may not be your own. Taking on a simpler view of the text will allow you to get in just the essence of what is going on. Taking on a philosophical view could leave you asking yourself many questions, even a simple "why?". Taking different approaches on a text will continue to broaden your view of the text, which could lead to opening different doors to what you may believe to be the "true" meaning of the text. However, this may not be the "true" meaning of the text, just your different approach on it. It all just depends on your ultimate approach on the novel.

 The reader, author and the text itself all play an important role in the understanding of a novel. The author writes the book not only from their approach, but from their feeling and emotions, of what they truly believe so much that it must be comprised all into a novel, and whether that message is direct or hidden in the text, from the authors point of view, it's there. The role of the read has an infinite amount of approaches, as an infinite number of people may read the book, each with multiple views on it. The reader may also share this view with other people, such as a critic. While this critic may state their approach on the book and what they believe is the true meaning, it is still their view. The final view, and sometimes the most confusing, is what is comprised in the text itself. The clues to what is in the text can often be found in things like the grammar, punctuation and the word play. Combining these can allow you to see what is the ultimate "unbiased" viewpoint, that is completely ignoring what the reader and the author believe, but what is truly comprised in the text that may lay before you. Using these three point of views, you can get an unbelievable understanding of the book, but it is important to remember that, while you think you might have struck diamonds on this digging expedition, there are plenty more approaches out there to be uncovered.</code></pre>
