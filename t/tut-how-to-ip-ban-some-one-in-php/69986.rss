    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-how-to-ip-ban-some-one-in-php/69986</link>
    <description>ok well i got bored so i made this for all of you that don&#39;t know how to do it its basic but it will work (i think lol)

ok well first off go here and read about cookies seen as we are using one and you need a server and to change your host file 
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,102322.0.html

ok well if you have everything you need lets get started! 

well how is this going to work well we are going to use i scripts i wrote so what will this script do? 
ok so the script well first get your ip then it will go through the banned ip&#39;s then it will go and see if you have the banned cookie if you do it will get it then the first if asks if you have it if you do then it will re direct you to what ever page you put if not then it will go through the banned ip&#39;s list and if you are there unlucky... you get redirected off of the site.

how do i ip ban some one using this?
well just make a new var under $bip1 = &#39;127.0.0.1&#39;; called $bip2 = &#39;whatever his ip is&#39;; and then ad another ifelse i think you can work it out.

sooooo were is the code ehh...?

well here it is 
[code]
&lt;?php
//Gets the IP address
$ip = getenv(&quot;REMOTE_ADDR&quot;);
//the baned persons ip
$bip1 = &#39;127.0.0.1&#39;;
//a cookie that has been set to save it looking for the ip or if he is on a proxie
$banedcookie = $_COOKIE[&#39;baned&#39;];
//a simple redirect
if ($benedcookie == ipbaned) {
	setcookie(&quot;baned&quot;, &quot;ipbaned&quot;, time()+3600*24*365, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;www.xtremetutorials.co.uk&quot;, 0);
  		header(&#39;Location: http://www.google.com/&#39;);
}
//if the ip = the band persons ip
elseif ($ip == $bip1) {
	setcookie(&quot;baned&quot;, &quot;ipbaned&quot;, time()+3600*24*365, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;www.xtremetutorials.co.uk&quot;, 0);
		header(&#39;Location: http://www.google.com/&#39;);
} else {
}
?&gt;
[/code]

here you go like to see it work well i cant do that as such because i don&#39;t know your ip but i can help you out and see the affect of it if i send you to my site then another page on my site here 
[b]links are being stupid[/b]
first go to www.xtremetutorials.co.uk/setcookie.php

then 

go to www.xtremetutorials.co.uk/ipban.php
