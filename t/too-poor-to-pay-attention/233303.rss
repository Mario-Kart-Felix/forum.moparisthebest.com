    <title>Too Poor to Pay Attention</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/too-poor-to-pay-attention/233303</link>
    <description>Being as I am, too poor to pay attention and as broke as a joke, I thought I might speak a few words on our economy. Nothing to do with cash, because everybody in America already knows CREAM (Cash Rules Everything Around Me). And if I were to speak about the exchange of value what value would I be speaking of and of what exchange? There are many ways to filter the infinite knowledge of the universe and repackage it to make it manageable, to pick up a shard of broken glass and make a mirror, but all these are finite and only take us away from the infinity around us. Yet ignorance is not bliss. Love, the only power which I know, the only thing which allows me to [b]begin[/b] to understand anything, is what I would like to speak of. 

Quite frankly the presidential election in the United States is getting uglier than a bag of smashed assholes. In the words of Ron Paul who was speaking at the time of a different sort of economy;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The president also tells us that Senators McCain and Obama will join him at the White House today in order to figure out how to get the bipartisan bailout passed. The two senators would do their country much more good if they stayed on the campaign trail debating who the bigger celebrity is, or whatever it is that occupies their attention these days.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Indeed realpolitik is a meaningless chuckle in this political vacuum. I fail to find any substantial difference between the candidates or their policies and wonder idly sometimes who is more confused, those voting for McCain out of confusion and fear or those voting for Obama out of hope. I find this situation extremely unrighteous but perhaps my sight is narrowed by trying to look to wide; my opinion of the candidates as clones is not valid and  I would like to know if anybody can wax sophomoric on the tangible differences between the two.* 

I believe they are the same because the power of love is dead within them, they are actors on a very dark stage in a theater which is burning down and nobody seems to care. There is the technology now and has been for a long time to produce energy enough for a sustainable number of human beings on this planet as well as food and sustenance for this finite number, yet one thing technology cannot produce is peace and happiness of the soul, and so CREAM onward, for there are already too many of us on this blue green marble and not one of us knows just what we are doing here.

<p>The people <span class="bbcode-b">are</span> America just as the people of any country are that country and though the government can control the thoughts of a people, to a point it, can never ensnare their spirit. Corporations “Run” our country but it is still individuals, the cogs within the machine, which do the doing. It is too easy to laugh in the face of a great evil industrial machine when we could instead take personal, if shared, responsibility. Kurt Vonnegut said something like 'We are all hopeless fossil fuel addicts and are leaders are committing violent crimes to get us more."</p>

<p>In my eyes the US is a great country, I’d love going there and even living there. But it’s political system sucks. I myself am a liberal, right wing person. I support a light version of a free market. The government should make rules, guidelines, minimum/maximum prices, etc. The rest is for the market. In the Netherlands we have rules about mortgages. If someone can’t afford it, he can’t get it. There is support for those without a job (altough I’d rather see this change a bit). I could go on and on about how a country should look like in my eyes. America just went too far, it’s market system is great on the short run (short run can even mean 100 years) but on the long run it sucks.</p>

              <p>Being as I am, too poor to pay attention and as broke as a joke, I thought I might speak a few words on our economy. Nothing to do with cash, because everybody in America already knows CREAM (Cash Rules Everything Around Me). And if I were to speak about the exchange of value what value would I be speaking of and of what exchange? There are many ways to filter the infinite knowledge of the universe and repackage it to make it manageable, to pick up a shard of broken glass and make a mirror, but all these are finite and only take us away from the infinity around us. Yet ignorance is not bliss. Love, the only power which I know, the only thing which allows me to <span class="bbcode-b">begin</span> to understand anything, is what I would like to speak of.</p>
<p>Quite frankly the presidential election in the United States is getting uglier than a bag of smashed assholes. In the words of Ron Paul who was speaking at the time of a different sort of economy;</p>
<blockquote>The president also tells us that Senators McCain and Obama will join him at the White House today in order to figure out how to get the bipartisan bailout passed. The two senators would do their country much more good if they stayed on the campaign trail debating who the bigger celebrity is, or whatever it is that occupies their attention these days.</blockquote>
<p>Indeed realpolitik is a meaningless chuckle in this political vacuum. I fail to find any substantial difference between the candidates or their policies and wonder idly sometimes who is more confused, those voting for McCain out of confusion and fear or those voting for Obama out of hope. I find this situation extremely unrighteous but perhaps my sight is narrowed by trying to look to wide; my opinion of the candidates as clones is not valid and  I would like to know if anybody can wax sophomoric on the tangible differences between the two.*</p>
<p>I believe they are the same because the power of love is dead within them, they are actors on a very dark stage in a theater which is burning down and nobody seems to care. There is the technology now and has been for a long time to produce energy enough for a sustainable number of human beings on this planet as well as food and sustenance for this finite number, yet one thing technology cannot produce is peace and happiness of the soul, and so CREAM onward, for there are already too many of us on this blue green marble and not one of us knows just what we are doing here.</p>
