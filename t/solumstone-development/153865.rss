    <description>[b][u]Goals[/u][/b]
[i]The goal of this small team is to help me code V6 of my serverbatch (compiler) which will hopefully be a massive update compared to the previous releases. I need to a few people, three at the maximum, to help me code some of the ideas into the serverbatches. Applicants require no experience at batch programming, but need to be willing to learn and must be able to operate as part of a team as well as an individual. Applicants must also be able to meet deadlines.[/i]

[b][u]Achievements so far (by Syrillia)[/u][/b]
[i]Successfully coded a file backup script.
Successfully coded an auto-restarter.
Successfully coded a commands generator.
Successfully coded an auto-detect compiler, that will compile regardless of whether environmental variable have been set.[/i]

[b][u]Future achievements[/u][/b]
[i]We hope to be able code an anti-decompiler code for closed-source clients and such.
We hope to be able to code an anti-SYIPKPKER.[/i]

[b][u]The Team[/u][/b]
[i]Team Leader - Syrillia[/i]
[i]Coder 1 - X-J-K-X
Coder 2 - Musicmad441

<p>Accepted, welcome. Once the team has been assembled, you’ll receive instructions via PM. I hope you’ll be as valuable an asset to the team as you have been to Moparscape. I would ask you to download a copy of Version 5.5 from my site for reference purposes.[/quote]</p>
