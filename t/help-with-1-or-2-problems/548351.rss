    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-1-or-2-problems/548351</link>
    <description>Okay I have made a web-client and client.jar the client.jar seems to work find but I already have my cache etc downloaded on my pc so prob why it works :l
I am pretty sure I fixed everything within my client etc .java files and I compiled them into classes. when I run my web-client I get this [img]http://i.imgur.com/EDkhD2P.png[/img] I will update this thread if anyone needs to see my client.java and or signlink.java (I think its called that.)

Thanks to anyone who can help me fix this problem (:</description>
