    <title>Working out</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/working-out/441340</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working out a lot in the past month and a half, and now, since I&#39;m home and have no access to my college gym, I&#39;m planning on trying P90X (an intense exercise program) rather than joining my local gym. I have lost around 15-16 pounds while toning my body and putting on a lot more muscle in the last 45 days. (Fatty arms to visible biceps and triceps now. ;D)

I am 5&#39; 10&quot; (69 inches). I went from 188 pounds a month and a half ago to 172 pounds as of now. I&#39;m looking either to reach my goal of 160 pounds within the next four months, but then again, numbers mean nothing. I&#39;d rather build muscle and stay the same weight.

I&#39;m really just looking to build muscle, because I think I&#39;ve lost enough weight already. In the end, it&#39;s more about my physique than my actual weight.

I&#39;m looking for tips on working out and what supplements to take, etc. I&#39;m going to stick with my plan of P90X for 3 months, while doing free weights, etc. I am going to take some protein, the Muscle Milk brand (only after workouts, because it&#39;s expensive).

Any comments, questions, or tips would be appreciated! Oh, and please, I&#39;d rather have people respond from personal experience because anyone can use Google and give me a shit ton of information. (Believe me, I&#39;ve researched a lot already, but I&#39;d rather have people that have personal experience with working out give me some tips!) ..I also don&#39;t really know how active members on here are.... I know I&#39;m pretty active, haha..

Thanks everyone.</description>

There’s also this one workout a kid is doing to get ready for college football. It’s like, “The bars of death” or something. You rep as much weight as you can eight times 3 sets. And you rotate between bench, squat, and deadlift. On the next day you do lots of running, lunges, and dumbell presses. Then the next day you go back to the squats bench and dumbell.</p>

Jc, just out of curiosity, how much do you bench and back squat? We are literally almost the same size. I’m 5’10 and I weighed 173.0 pounds with all of my clothing on yesterday (khakis and shirt no shoes).</p>
<p>If you are a serious body builder you are supposed to take like 1-1.5 grams/lb you weigh.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m 5’ 10" and I’m around 170 lbs now. I just recently started benching, so I can only bench 120 with good form.</p>
<p>I’m taking ~40g protein post workout as of now. The other protein comes from food.</p>

You do realize the average person consumes more than enough protein anyway?<br>

I only eat like 100 grams of protein max. If I went by that rule I would need around 200 grams per day.[/quote]</p>

<p>I started working out because I knew being a nerd would make me really skinny. When youre skinny and a nerd you’re a geek/video game nerd, when youre toned/builtish and a nerd youre a “smart cute guy” It generally shows others that you are nerdy but you go out of your way to take care of yourself, its a decent tradeoff.</p>
