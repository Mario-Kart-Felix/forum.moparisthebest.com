    <title>Problem with rights level 3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-rights-level-3/11588</link>
    <description>from looking around i saw that if i want to be the owner of my server, (i use warscape base) i have to go into client.java and edit the serverowner name from slysoft to the name i wanna use. i did that and when i made my account, i didn&#39;t have and crowns but when i logged into slysoft he was still the owner with mod rights 3. i did save. after that i went to my character&#39;s file and changed his rights to 3 but when i logged in it went back to 0. after that i logged into slysoft and used the ::nick command to change his name to mine and i also renamed all his files to my name but when i logged in, i was still mod rights 0. i have no idea whats left to do. also if you give me a working answer and tell how to rep+ then i will rep+ you.</description>

              <p>I had same problem! Okay, log out. Take your file out, edit rights to 2. Log in. Talk and see crown. Log out. Open and re-edit to 3. Save. Log in. Tada.</p>

owners can also see their own crown, you just have to add a bugfix:</p>
<p>open client.java, search for</p>
<p><code>
out.write(playerRights);</code><br>
then REPLACE that line with</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (playerRights == 3) {
out.write(2);      //Crown fixup
} else {
out.write(playerRights); // mod level

<p>that’ll let owners see their own crown (which is the only playerRights group that can’t otherwise)</p>
