    <description>&#39;sup Moparscape.

As some of you who know me will be aware, I ran a web hosting service a few years ago which did pretty well until I sold it when I started college (pretty hard to offer decent support when you&#39;ve got class to be honest) Well, got plenty of free time again, so...

boxn.co.uk is going to be a web development community &amp; hosted service provider. The website is currently under construction (officially launches Feb 1), but http://boxn.co.uk currently redirects to the forum, it&#39;d be great if you stopped by and said hello there if you are interested in web development or design.

We currently offer 3 shared packages:

[u]Free Lunch[/u] 100mb Space, 500mb Bandwidth
A small free package aimed at developers or people just starting their website. Offers a reasonable amount of space and transfer for testing or lightweight sites, and is free for life - simply sign up at http://billing.boxn.co.uk/cart.php . There are a limited amount of these accounts available for now, and they come with no technical support except for obviously problems on our end, but are ad-free and have the goodies.
[b]All I ask is, if you use this account for something cool, come and showcase it in the &quot;rate my site&quot; section on the forums so we can see what you&#39;re up to. :)[/b]

[u]Community[/u] 1000mb Space, 5000mb Bandwidth
This is another free package with much less restriction, available only to active members of our community. Again, to sign up just sign up at http://billing.boxn.co.uk/cart.php , however a valid forum username must be given on the signup forum or the account will not be activated. For obvious reasons (the forum was installed today and there is no community to be a part of yet :p) none of these accounts have been given out, but I could be persuaded. These accounts also get the full technical support of the paid account.

[u]Unmetered[/u] - No bandwidth or space restriction.
Yep, an unmetered package. This usually costs $8.49 a month and has unmetered disk space and transfer, however is subject to CPU restrictions if your site becomes incredibly CPU intensive. This is not an issue for most sites, if you are confused as to whether your site would come under this restriction before you order, just email sales@boxn.co.uk and I will help you out. But as a guideline: your forum/blog/website is fine, but you can&#39;t run a private server on it. :)
[b]Moparscape members get this package for half price for life by using the promo code &quot;moparscape&quot; when signing up. :)[/b] (That&#39;s less than $5 a month.)

[i]All accounts include CPanel and the usual extras: POP/IMAP Email, Fantastico, FTP Accounts etc.[/i]

We have some pretty cool ideas for new services in the near future, after everything is well oiled and running smoothly. In particularly, some funky app hosting stuff which would be of particular interest to RSPS owners...

If you have any questions or want to talk about the service, just drop an email to support@boxn.co.uk and I will get back to you.
As I said, the website does not go gold until Feb 1st, however the forum is up and running so you could also take your queries there.
Also, as launch gets closer, we&#39;ll be running some one-off promo type stuff on our twitter account, http://twitter.com/boxnteam - follow us there if you want to get in on that.

<p>EDIT: Since there may well be quirks… the next 5 people to sign up on the forum get a community level account, no matter activity. Just sign up for it in the cart and I’ll approve it. (Kihomura is <span class="hashtag">#1</span> if he wants it, since he signed up already)</p>

              <p>'sup Moparscape.</p>
<p>As some of you who know me will be aware, I ran a web hosting service a few years ago which did pretty well until I sold it when I started college (pretty hard to offer decent support when you’ve got class to be honest) Well, got plenty of free time again, so…</p>
<p><a href="http://boxn.co.uk">boxn.co.uk</a> is going to be a web development community &amp; hosted service provider. The website is currently under construction (officially launches Feb 1), but <a href="http://boxn.co.uk">http://boxn.co.uk</a> currently redirects to the forum, it’d be great if you stopped by and said hello there if you are interested in web development or design.</p>
<p>We currently offer 3 shared packages:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Free Lunch</span> 100mb Space, 500mb Bandwidth<br>
A small free package aimed at developers or people just starting their website. Offers a reasonable amount of space and transfer for testing or lightweight sites, and is free for life - simply sign up at <a href="http://billing.boxn.co.uk/cart.php">http://billing.boxn.co.uk/cart.php</a> . There are a limited amount of these accounts available for now, and they come with no technical support except for obviously problems on our end, but are ad-free and have the goodies.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">All I ask is, if you use this account for something cool, come and showcase it in the “rate my site” section on the forums so we can see what you’re up to. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Community</span> 1000mb Space, 5000mb Bandwidth<br>
This is another free package with much less restriction, available only to active members of our community. Again, to sign up just sign up at <a href="http://billing.boxn.co.uk/cart.php">http://billing.boxn.co.uk/cart.php</a> , however a valid forum username must be given on the signup forum or the account will not be activated. For obvious reasons (the forum was installed today and there is no community to be a part of yet :p) none of these accounts have been given out, but I could be persuaded. These accounts also get the full technical support of the paid account.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Unmetered</span> - No bandwidth or space restriction.<br>
Yep, an unmetered package. This usually costs $8.49 a month and has unmetered disk space and transfer, however is subject to CPU restrictions if your site becomes incredibly CPU intensive. This is not an issue for most sites, if you are confused as to whether your site would come under this restriction before you order, just email <a href="mailto:sales@boxn.co.uk">sales@boxn.co.uk</a> and I will help you out. But as a guideline: your forum/blog/website is fine, but you can’t run a private server on it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Moparscape members get this package for half price for life by using the promo code “moparscape” when signing up. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></span> (That’s less than $5 a month.)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">All accounts include CPanel and the usual extras: POP/IMAP Email, Fantastico, FTP Accounts etc.</span></p>
<p>We have some pretty cool ideas for new services in the near future, after everything is well oiled and running smoothly. In particularly, some funky app hosting stuff which would be of particular interest to RSPS owners…</p>
<p>If you have any questions or want to talk about the service, just drop an email to <a href="mailto:support@boxn.co.uk">support@boxn.co.uk</a> and I will get back to you.<br>
As I said, the website does not go gold until Feb 1st, however the forum is up and running so you could also take your queries there.<br>
Also, as launch gets closer, we’ll be running some one-off promo type stuff on our twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/boxnteam">http://twitter.com/boxnteam</a> - follow us there if you want to get in on that.</p>
