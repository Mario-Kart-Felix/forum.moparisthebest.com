    <title>Cache downloads for me but not other people?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-downloads-for-me-but-not-other-people/550096</link>
    <description>Ok, so my client works fine for ME, i can delete the cache then it will re download it. When anyone else tries to download it it says client updated please reload. And in their files where my cache goes, it has the right name and such just the cache files is the wrong size. Ex. if the cache was 18mb it goes in their filestore as like 3mb. I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s the site i&#39;m using to host my cache which is Mediafire,(I know mediafire sucks and yes you can get a direct link from mediafire) but does anyone have site ideas to host my cache not dropbox because i cant get a download that ends in (.zip) because for it to be a direct link it needs to have (dl=.?1) or something like that. And i have also tried using a website to host such as 000webhost but the cache is to large for the site to upload. if anyone could help me that&#39;d be awesome and if i need more information just let me know, Thanks.</description>
