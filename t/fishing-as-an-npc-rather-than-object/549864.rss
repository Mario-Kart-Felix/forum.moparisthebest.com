    <description>Does anyone happen to know (or care to guess) why Fishing Spots are Npcs rather than Objects?</description>

<p>that would only apply for dairy cows directly that was something added during the antibotting phase of rs2 originally you could use a bucket on any cow even during early rs2. Fishing spots have always been npcs</p>

They do move though. Which is why you can have a fishing spot right clicked before it moves, hover over the fishing option, and then once it moves you click and you will move to the new location. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Go ahead and try it right now, I can guarantee it will work.

              <p>[quote=“sinisoul, post:24, topic:549864”]Not exactly. There’s actually a lot of times where the path sent from the client is ignored and the server fabricates a path. ex: Proper alignment in furnaces. If that was the case, and I think the case where you would expect this to be true where you click and you move to the next spot would be a case of the NPC teleporting which by all means is very plausible. The NPC Walking there however? No.[/quote]The client actually calculates proper alignment for furnaces, and other interactable objects. I’m not sure how exactly (I would guess the interact location is somewhere in the object def?), but I actually realized that a while back when working on the official server. If you are right next to an object, but on the wrong side of it (for example ground levers, the winch for the flag on lumby castles, etc) it will still have you walk to the correct location. As for whether or not the fishing spot actually ‘walks’ to the new location, I’m not sure. I thought I remembered it doing that, but I’m not sure when exactly I remember it from (IE - if I could find it on OSRS) so I can’t double check. But either way, the NPC teleporting is still moving, keeping the same ID, which is why it would be a NPC and not an object (which is what the topic is about, :P). I cant find a bot that gives you entity indexes unfortunately to test, and I’m too lazy to write a script for one to do it myself.</p>
<p>If it does turn out to not need to ‘move’, then I guess the answer to OP would be as simple as [quote=“Tatemo, post:22, topic:549864”]Fish are living beings <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> They are NPCs not objects.[/quote]</p>

<p>I’m willing to bet that there is an AI behavior for fishing spots that selects a random spot and teleports the spot there. Which would look something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">onAiBehavior(fishing_move_spot, local function move_spot()
  delay(time)
  tele(some_random_spot)
  fork(move_spot)
end)</code></pre>

              <p>[quote=“sinisoul, post:19, topic:549864”]No. That’s not definite proof. That’s server sided, you can easily force people to walk to the other active spot.[/quote]It’s an interact message, meaning the client calculates a path based on the given Entity and sends a walking queue message, and then an NPC interact message. You’re saying the server then ignores that walking queue message, finds the different NPC, and then recalculates the walking queue for it? I guess it wouldn’t be that hard, but it seems rather counter intuitive. What would the reason be behind that, when simply moving the NPC would produce the exact same result with less calculating required? And again, I still distinctly remember seeing fish move around like any other NPC.</p>
<p>I am going to find a working bot that has debug information to see if I can see NPC indexes, because it is possible that I’m remembering them moving incorrectly, but I am like 85% sure.</p>
