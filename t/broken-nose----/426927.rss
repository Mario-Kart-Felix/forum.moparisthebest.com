    <title>Broken nose -___-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/broken-nose----/426927</link>
    <description>Me and friend we&#39;re fucking round. I pinned him on the floor (no homo) then i let off e swug his elbow up to get up smacked me right in the fucking nose. I started pouring out blood, ima say about a pint. Its been about an hour now and i cant feel my nose, i know its in pain and i don&#39;t want to agrivate it. I&#39;ve tried moving it around and it seems fine. I bled for about 20 minutes if that means anything. I can&#39;t breath out of my right nostril but blood was coming out of both nostrils. My right is already pretty swollen. Think it&#39;s broken? Should i go to the doctors? I mean i tough shit out and i was just like aye get me my laptop im bored of this bleeding. It feels like i took an arrow to the nose though -____-. Suggestions?

Debating just waking my parents to take me to er (Keeping in mind it is 2:00 am) and they&#39;ll get pretty pist is my idea. Cheers if you can help out.</description>

              <p>Theres not much they can do for a broken nose… Not like they can give you a cast or anything. Aslong as its not bleeding still and aslong as it doesn’t look like someone stood on your face I would leave it.</p>
