    <description>Hi, I semi-recently began uploading videos to my channel [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/worldcodingjava]https://www.youtube.com/user/worldcodingjava[/url]. I started off with a Slick2D series and while I occasionally still update that series I have now moved onto JMonkeyEngine tutorials along with LWJGL tutorials. I also have two less frequently updated series in which I teach Python and beginner Java.

I believe the quality of my earlier videos wasn&#39;t great however I think that I have now improved the quality greatly and I would like to keep increasing the quality of my videos. If anyone has any suggestions as to what content I could include on my channel and/or any general improvements I would much appreciate them either as a comment or a reply to this topic. Alternatively just enjoy the videos and I hope you can learn something from them ! :)

thanks for any suggestions in advance - Josh</description>

              <p>I’m gonna take a look at these here later. Keep updating the beginner’s java section because that’s where I’ll be starting <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
