    <title>317 client models - OpenRS Cachelib</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-client-models-openrs-cachelib/401321</link>
    <description>I had a blank source+client, but i can&#39;t find the models file, so i ditched that source.
But someone told me that i could use OpenRS Cachelib, and i downloaded it... And wtf do i do with it?
And i already did the hidden files thing, so i can see ALL files...
Or
It would be a lot easier to give me a link to a source and client, that the client has a &quot;models&quot; folder.
Thanks.</description>
