1. Introduction / Explanation
Hello, and welcome! So, you&#39;re interested in a level 1 account? A Maxed account? RARE names? An account with more party hats than you can imagine? Good, Then you have made the right purchase! Not only will this guide explain step by step how to obtain these accounts, but it will also give you lists of accounts to target!

So how does this work? Since Jagex started their Account recovery system, it has always been flawed. This guide will tell you how to exploit this to your benefit!

When we pick an account we want to recover (Several lists of accounts will be given in section 2) We go to Runescape.com&gt;Help&gt;Password Recover. Once you are there type in the name of the account you want to recover, and then click Submit. When the next page loads click &quot;Recover forgotten password&quot;. After that click Recover Manually. Finally, click on &quot;I can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to provide an email address&quot;.

&quot;OMFG I&#39;m Going to recover Zezima!!!!!&quot; No, you&#39;re not. Why? Because it is nearly impossible to recover an active or well-known account unless it has been inactive for a long period of time.

Will this method work 100% of the time? No, however, after some practice you should be getting accounts almost every day!

2. Lists of accounts to target
Below I will list some good lists of accounts to recover.

List of the stat-wiped accounts (Chance of getting a level 1 [1hp]) TONS of 9 hp accounts: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=9YRUDEY5

Runescape Classic High Scores(Chance of getting a maxed/rich accounts): http://www.megaupload.com/?d=PT2DQPYY

NOTE: You can also recover rare names. Simply pick a name and check the high scores, if it is not active, go for it!


3. Useful Software
Hotspot Shield - This is a program that is basically a proxy, what it does it make websites think that your ip is different than what is really is. In this case, you can only try to recover 5 accounts per hour, but if you use this you can recover as many as you want per hour!

Download Hotspot Shield at: hotspotshield.com

4. Recovery Questions
Now that we&#39;ve got the the lists of accounts and our proxy, we&#39;re ready to recover!

Go to the recovery section of the appeal form.

If the questions look like this or are &quot;Answer 1, Answer 2, Answer 3&quot; etc, tick the &quot;I have not set any recovery questions&quot; box.

If they are custom set recoveries, you have several options. You can try to guess them(not recommended), you can still tick the &quot;I have not set any recovery questions&quot; box(works about about 1/5 of the time) Or you can skip this account and chose a different account to try and recover (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

5. Subscription Details
Go to the Sucscription Details part of the appeal form.

Do not click anything on this. Jagex does not keep track of subscriptions made before 2004 and all of these accounts were made in 2001-2002

NOTE: You will not see this section on every appeal, if you do not see it, it mens the account has never been a member. Don&#39;t worry! F2P Accounts have rares to!

6. Previous Passwords
Go to the previous password portion of the form.

THIS IS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT PART OF RECOVERY!

Lets face it, people in 2001 were not very smart about their passwords, for passwords use common things such as: dragon,password,dog,cat,spongebob,jagex,runescape, master, 12345,1234567890.

Personally I use password, 12345, qwerty. They work very well for me.

NOTE: MAKE SURE you fill in all 3 password fields

7. Contact Details
Go to the contact details part of the form.

This is not a crucial part of recovery, but it helps a tiny bit. For the &quot;Your postcode or ZIP code&quot; I put 45834, but you can put whatever you want, but make sure it&#39;s only 5 numbers.

NOTE: DO NOT PUT AN EMAIL!!!

8. Other Details
Go to the other details part of the appeal form.

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF RECOVERY!!!!!

Ok, so depending on the list we chose determines what year we use all the accounts on the Runescape Classic High Scores were made in 2001, so if you are doing one of those pick 2001. The name of the account determines the month we will choose. If the name it was &quot;The&quot; it was probably made closer to the start of Runescape, so lets pick February or March. If the name is something like &quot;i pwnz0rz n00bs&quot; it was probably made later, so lets pick September or August or something around there.

The stat-wiped accounts were made in both 2001 and 2002, however I recommend sticking with 2001. And again, pick a month depending on the names.

For rare names that are not on a list, use 2001, and i have the most success with September for the month on random accounts.

NOTE: I have, from experience, learned that March and May work a lot better than any other months.

Last Step of Other Details, The More info box.

This is a very important. You need to make up a story, The best thing to do is use something along the lines of:

&quot;When I created this account I lived in England with my Dad, a few years later my dad died, and I moved back to the United States to live with my mom and my sister. When I last played Runescape, I was in Varrock training my firemaking skill.&quot;

Obviously, do not copy that word for word, but use that as a guideline.

I hope my guide was helpful
