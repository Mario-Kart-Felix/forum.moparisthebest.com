    <title>Runescape Garry&#39;s Mod Gamemode?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-garrys-mod-gamemode/522043</link>
    <description>I was just wondering if anyone would be interested in doing this, I think it&#39;s a great idea, and that it would be pretty popular. It would take map makers, who would have to learn to use the hammer tool, a couple modelers who would have to learn how to create models in the mdl format, and also make vtf and vmf files for textures and such. (I&#39;m not sure if at all possible, but if you could port the models and such into these formats that would be awesome, I wouldn&#39;t know where to start on that), and then the Lua portion of it, which is where I&#39;d be most useful. Lua is a lot like Java in many things, just the Garry&#39;s Mod functions take a while to learn. So tell me what you think, maybe if it picks up support we could start this as a full blown project?</description>

<p>The RuneScape models can and have been converted into popular formats that can be imported into gmod, I don’t see the point of a game mode though?</p>

<p>Bringing a unique gamemode to the game, all you have is RP gamemodes like ClockWork, PERP, DarkRP, maybe some TTT and Sandbox on the side, but there isn’t anything all that unique, just 1,000 servers per each gamemode. While RS is an RPG to an extent, it’s something that hasn’t even be brought up before. Only issue I have are copyright issues, and downloads. Since RS isn’t a mountable game to GMod, I don’t know if the workshop would allow it, and having it up for a download could take hours…</p>
