    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-seem-to-conncet-to-my-server-ip/399756</link>
    <description>well im using noip and it use to work perfect! about a year or some months back but now i cant connect when i update my client to the ip?

ive tried on 508 562 317 and 525 and wont work on any... there is avirus on my computer i think preventing me from using some java things so that may be  the problem, what do you guys have to say?

(trying to connect to delta)

<p>The compiler isn’t broken you just need to change it to your version of jdk and you do need to port forward with no-ip. If your hosting off the computer that won’t connect try connecting with 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0</p>
