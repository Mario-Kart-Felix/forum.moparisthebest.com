    <title>Wiki for RSPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wiki-for-rsps/294908</link>
    <description>Well, Graham and I have set upon ourselves the task of gathering and documenting all of the information we can about general RuneScape Private Servers and hacking of RuneScape and compiling it into one wiki, which should hopefully become the &quot;go-to&quot; place in the future for RSPS information.

I would like to know what you guys think of this idea, and whether or not you guys would help contribute to the project.
I&#39;m certain it is worth our time and it will help out thousands throughout the progress in development of private servers. 
We&#39;ve got some stuff done so far, but there is still [u]much[/u] to do. All of the Veterans in this section together have an absolutely immense knowledge of RuneScape hacking, and I was wondering if we&#39;d all be willing to just write down what we know into this sort-of reference manual to-be. Perhaps even some of you could do some research and pioneering in certain areas in order to contribute to the wiki.

Once the wiki becomes relatively large, it will be announced among many communities as a huge knowledge base for RuneScape Private Servers.
I ask that you post on this thread (so Graham can see) if you wish to take part in this (hopefully) historic project.

Post your feedback, corrections, and applications.
Much thanks!</description>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:41, topic:294908”]If I install mediawiki for you, give you phpmyadmin access for your database, and run it on your own IP would that be good enough for you?  It would be much faster than me tidying up all of my permissions and giving you ssh access.  If you want ssh access I can do that too it would just take longer.[/quote]That works just fine, I don’t need SSH access if everything is set up. Can I get FTP access to the RuneWiki directory though? (so I can upload images/etc. for the wiki)</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
When it’s all setup, just PM me with the authentication info and the nameservers I need to use.</p>

Not many people would vandalise. That isn’t an issue.</p>
<p>The issue is that they unknowingly write articles that, for all intents and purposes, are low quality and of no use.<br>
I wish I could remember who came out with the quote “Moparscapers are still trying to put the square in the circle hole”, because it’s very true.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Then we have a double problem here. We could try to get smarter people to add accurate information, yet most of them are unmotivated and unwilling, not to mention moparscapers/commonfolk won’t understand their articles (which the wiki is targeting, as far as I can see). On the other hand, moparscapers can write the articles and the smarter people can correct them. Here we have articles understandable to the general public, yet there is less accurate information being passed around.</p>
<p>What to do.[/quote]The few that are motivated and experienced enough (atm samuraiblood2 and myself, but that’s about it) write it for those that are experienced with Java/etc. but may not know everything about the protocol/etc. The point is to cache information that is miscellaneously distributed throughout the minds of RuneScape hackers (although that part is tough to do because they are too lazy to edit the wiki) and cache any information that can be gathered into one central point, so that future RuneScape hackers don’t have to re-discover what we are discovering now (kind of like how humanity lost Democracy after Greece fell, only to regain it now in the modern world) and instead can focus on new, undiscovered developments.</p>
<p>RuneWiki is aimed to help improve the future of RuneScape hacking.<br>
It’s also a good way for me personally to learn about the technical aspects of RuneScape because it’s for a real purpose - to record it so other people can learn it without going through the struggles I had to; and instead, they can focus on undiscovered things and ideally record them in the RuneWiki once they realize how helpful it was to them in the first place.</p>
<p>The way I see it, as Jagex constantly updates RuneScape, there will constantly be things for us as a whole to learn and understand, RuneWiki is meant to be an on-going encyclopedia/history-book of how RuneScape works now and has worked in the past from a tehcnical standpoint.</p>
<p>Holy shit that was heartfelt.</p>

I don’t think there’d be too many issues if the MSCP userbase got involved with RuneWiki - you have to create an account to edit, and all sysops hold people completely responsible for their own actions: simply one case of vandalism = permanent IP ban.</p>

<p>Well then, if mopar is joining the party, maybe some proper advertisement is necessary. Maybe it could be added to the news, an announcement could be made, and maybe an update to the front page of the website. What do you think mopar?</p>

<p>No &amp;&amp; I agree with Lothy on rm’ing the mscp wiki.</p>
<p>PS, have strict article editing/creation rules.</p>

<p>No way. Way to ruin something good.</p>
<p>I took the time to look at this website’s wiki, despite believing it was going to be a mistake. Needless to say, mistake.<br>
I can’t believe we actually let riff-raff users add that stuff as ‘content’.</p>
<p>EDIT: We should just nuke the moparscape wiki. It’s completely useless by even the most generous and forgiving standards that could possibly be held by the nicest person in the world.</p>
