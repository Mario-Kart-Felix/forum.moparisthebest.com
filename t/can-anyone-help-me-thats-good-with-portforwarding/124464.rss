    <description>i have troubles with port forwarding.... when i type commands or cmd on run it brings my to black box and i type in ipconfig/all and it has my ips and you know how the default gateway should be like 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1 well mine is way off from that.

i even tryed typeing in the address bar like it says 192.168.1.1 but never works. people say i need a wirless connection in order for this to work.
