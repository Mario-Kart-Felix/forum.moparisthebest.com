[size=14pt][u][b]Introduction (about me)[/b][/u] [/size] 
Hey guys, 
I&#39;m dwarfs222 and i&#39;m presenting Rune-Declassified. 
I worked with Java for about 2.5year now, and to close this party of my life I&#39;m going to make a final project. 
I have some very unqiue idea&#39;s for this server. 
IT WILL BE UNIQUE! 

[size=14pt][u][b]About the Server [/b] [/u]  [/size] 
One of my idea was to make Jobs, when people play for the first time they have to choose a job like: Fletcher, Lumberjack , miner and/or smith, Herblorist,... 
We will have to keep the economy stable so [b]players will have to work togheter[/b]! 
Than you have the customer: mostly PKER&#39;s. 
I have some more idea&#39;s: 
The head shop will be &quot;The general store&quot; (ofcourse?) 
And you will get your skillcapes Like in RuneScape.


[b][u]More Information[/u][/b] 
Rune-Declassified is nothing with money. 
The meaning of this server is to keep it fun for all players! 
[b][u]I STILL DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD USE AS BASE:DELTA OR PI? (&lt;-- what do the developers like?)[/u][/b]

[b][u]Apply[/u][/b] 
&lt;blockquote&gt;-How much time do you spent a day to this project? 
          -Applying for: Server-Sided Programmer , GFXer, Advisor, Hoster, Tester? 
          -Motivation? 
          -Want to get payed or not? (Only with Donations!)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The reason why I am not coding is: I have to much work for school so I&#39;ll just lead this project and help when I can. (&lt;-- That&#39;s why I want to pay the coders with donations.) 

Media coming soon....</description>

              <p>Although I’ve played other servers with ‘jobs’ I still like the general idea of it. Alright, moving on. This thread looks quite bare. You need more information, as in what base you’re using, what your future plans are, etc.</p>
<p>You may want to refer to this <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,528465.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">thread</a> as a guide. I know, I suggest this thread to a lot of members. It’s just, if a thread looks unique, it draws in more attention.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you.</p>
