<p>Oh, haha I didn’t read his whole post. I read the top where it said it went to the wrong slot &gt;.&lt;, my mistake. Yeah, your cache needs to load it probably off Class8 (java) and it needs to load the modelID’s from the cache.</p>

              <p>Jc22493, you are wrong. It is not the Item (config), most likely it will be Item (java). The item’s should be added in the ARRAY.</p>
<p><code>
public static int[] fullHelm = { };</code></p>
<p>That’s a nice example of how it would look like, but different conventions possibly.</p>
