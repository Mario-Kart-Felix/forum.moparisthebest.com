    <title>Geting a site compatible with IE (yuck) as well as FF</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/geting-a-site-compatible-with-ie-yuck-as-well-as-ff/126383</link>
    <description>hey just a quick question if i take my site to XHTML 1.0 strict would that do it or whould i have to use the css checker as well? and even if i do all that would it be compatible?

its just ive designed my site from nothing in FireFox and now its screwed up in IE so you know i gotta get it working.. also is there a quick way of doing it or do i have to just look at the error list then go find out what needs changing then go change it?

~thanks N00b1</description>
