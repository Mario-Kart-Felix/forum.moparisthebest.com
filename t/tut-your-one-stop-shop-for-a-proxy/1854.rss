    <title>[Tut] Your one stop shop for a proxy</title>

    <description>Ok people I know you have been using proxys for aryan so you don&#39;t get banned but Ive found a much easier way to proxy (no need to make a new bat file). Its called Tor and it uses the onion router network.. Let me explain how it works, you begin by downloading a program called Tor and Privoxy.    The way Tor works is by routing you through many proxy&#39;s at a time (fast and efficiently) sending you through many layers of protection (like a onion) and there for is very anonymous. It also switches proxy&#39;s on the fly and it seems to have no affect on runescape.. Best of all is you don&#39;t need to configure anything it does it all for you just leave it running and it routs all your games(some don&#39;t like it) and aryan...] So if you want to give it a try here is a link to their main page http://tor.eff.org/ and for the download is http://tor.eff.org/download.html.en It comes for linux and mac if you really want to run it on them too.. Now to get it working its pretty easy... Download the bundle package http://www.freehaven.net/~edmanm/torcp/download/tor-0.1.1.18-torcp-0.0.4-bundle.exe for the download and install all of three of the application.. Then once install run them. Once their running look at the bottom left cornor of your monitor down at the start bar and you should see a P and  Onion if the Onion has a check right next to it then its working and your running through a proxy and that means time to run aryan.. It has worked for me fine, but I havent had time to macro recently and want you to try it. I think if it works and works well it would be a very new way to beat Jagex&#39;s new macro system and save your main.. If you need help or just want to talk im me at Halodude1489@aol.com on msn.</description>
