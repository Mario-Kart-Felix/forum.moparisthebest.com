    <title>Project Blade -Looking for members</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-blade-looking-for-members/156111</link>
    <description>Hello, and welcome to my project Blade thread.

[size=16pt]Quick explanation.[/size]

[i]I recently had an idea of Creating My own server, And i am in search of members. *Note*
I&#39;m not looking for staff, But if i do notice great effort in your position you will be rewarded.
I have been looking through my sources. I was thinking of using the project destiny source (V1.8)
But, that will be left up to my members.[/i]

[b][i]Sources current features.
Bugged specials (I&#39;ll fix)
Fletching (adding a gfx)
woodcutting (works)
firemaking (I&#39;ll also fix this)

[size=14pt]This source has much potential.[/size][/i][/b]

[size=16pt]Some plans[/size]
-Server-side-
[b].Special attacks, I will be adding.
.Items compatiable with silabsofts client. (FOR NOW)
.Maybe some cleaning for the client.java.
. 80-100% Non- combat skills.
-More when the time comes-

-client-side-
.471 game frame (maybe some vengence GFX)
.Extract some models
.Some different sprites

-Thats all for now[/b]

[size=16pt]What you can do to help![/size]

[i][size=15pt]Dont even try to steal my password, All passwords will be encoded in salt. I hope i can trust you whoever Applys for this.[/size][/i]

Forum Builder(s) [size=15pt][/size]I might buy forums, Depending how this all works out.
-
-

Two for now.

[b][i]Why should I join the team?[/i][/b]

This was made for fun, this is where members of mopar can get together and create great peices of art.
-No premium will be made.
-No admins/mods will be sold of course.
