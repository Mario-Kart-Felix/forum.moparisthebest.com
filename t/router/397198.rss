    <description>Can an old router affect your download speed and bandwidth? Looking into buying a new router as my Internet plan is 5mb of bandwidth yet everyone on my Internet downloads at 80kb/s. Bandwidth isn&#39;t like comcast in how comcast shares bandwidth with neighbors. Also the router is extremely hot for only running like 60 volts of dc. Sometimes the Internet goes out and I think it&#39;s because the router overheats. Just making sure I&#39;m not wasting my money in buying a new router.</description>

Bit outdated, but it is the same speed. I have tested it maybe 1 month ago and it didn’t change. I even got the app on my iPod and it outputs the same data. 55kb/s upload and 70 kb/s download approx. Maybe allow 3-4 kb/s of a differential on those numbers. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I’ll redo the test when I get back on my computer at my house.</p>

<p>You mean through an ethernet cord right? My computer is connected directly with an ethernet cord and gets 79kb/s usually. I got an app to test the download speed of my iPod and it is the same exact speed. It fluctuates between 79 and 80 kb/s. Also our bandwidth may be more than 5mb. The plan for 5mb is $35 a month and we pay $55. Either way we should still be getting more than that. And every computer is downloading the same speed, at around 79 kb/s.</p>

<p>I’ve got a 30Mb/s connection and I’m getting around 27 - 29 MB/s (on the speedtest website)</p>

              <p>A 5mb/s internet connection is actually represented in 5 mega<span class="bbcode-b">bits</span> per second.  They do this so it sounds like it’s more than it really is, and it’s pretty shady in my opinion.  But it’s become industry standard.  Divide 5,000 by 8 (there are 8 bits in a byte) and you’ll get 625kb/s which is your maximum download speed in optimal conditions.</p>
<p>A router can affect download speed, ping, and other things.  But I wouldn’t be so quick to blame your router.  Try connecting a computer directly to your modem and analyze the speeds you get then, before you invest money in a new router.</p>
