<p>Rare Z you honestly have to read posts before posting the spam that you post. I saw him clearly say in his post that he is not getting a connection after putting the ethernet chord into the back of the router</p>
<p>Ok Iownuall, First you must have a power source leading from your router into the wall. After you have verified that it is powered then connect the ethernet chord that runs from your Cable Box to your wireless router. After that is completed you then must have a chord that is connected from your CPU tower to the wireless router</p>
