    <title>Sponsored page payment didnt go through</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sponsored-page-payment-didnt-go-through/551048</link>
    <description>Hi,

After waiting about 20 minutes after my purchase (on this account), it stills says that I haven&#39;t paid, but I surely did. The paypal transaction ID is: 23K355050D217302U.

Thanks,
Klaasvaakjes</description>
