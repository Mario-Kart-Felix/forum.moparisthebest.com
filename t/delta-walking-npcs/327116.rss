    <description>One problem down, another one to go.

My NPC&#39;s don&#39;t want to move. I&#39;m pretty sure i added them correctly, yet they won&#39;t move.

This is one my my spawned npc&#39;s:
[code]spawn = 4	3096	3504	0	3093	3506	3100	3501	1	Woman[/code]

I checked my NPC handler, and I found out that Randomwalking was turned off. However I have turned this back on, and checked the code for any other pieces of code that might be the problem.
This did not solve my problem though, my npcs still wont move.

So I ask you, what can be the cause of this? Did I just do something wrong?
