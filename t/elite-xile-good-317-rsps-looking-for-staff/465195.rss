    <description>Our community
Elite-Xile has a very nice and friendly community that is always there to help you out. We strive for direct player reflecion, this means that players are the ones that help each other out. This creates the best gaming situation possible.


Management
First I&#39;d like to start off with telling you about how our management works, we strive for the bestgameplay for everyone - we care about what people say and we listen to them. You are what makes us big, without players we would be close to nowhere. Players are your friends, you just need to know how to handle them. Due to this big support of our players we have fully fixed up our wilderness, we gave them a great platform for clans to build off to improve clan community, we have a great system that does not allow Pjing or ragging in certain zones because - let&#39;s be honest, it pisses people off. But at the same time it improves the single clans to be more active. We are thinking of solutions, 24/7. That is what makes us #1 - We are ALWAYS ahead of the rest.

Elite-Xile fits YOU.
RunePride was designed to entertain every type of player. We have different game modes where you can choose how you&#39;d like to play. This is your lucky day! RunePride will perfectly entertain you,You can also choose XP modes that vary from 5,000 XP per hit to 10 XP per hit. So if you either are a person who likes challanging gameplay or someone who just likes to enter our highly populated wilderness straight after logging in Elite-Xile is the place for you.

Ideal (What we strive for)
Our ideal is maximum entertainment. We are not in this business for the money, we are in this to give YOU the best entertainment. Your enjoyment of the game is what we strive for. You do not have to pay for anything because that simply goes against our ideal. Everything is free to enjoy! You have the option to purchase items, but you don&#39;t have to pay to wear specific items or to get privileges on other players!

That is how it&#39;s supposed to be, and that is how we do it.


Elite-Xile Videos
In our eyes a video explains more then a thousand pictures or words. You can find our videos on youtube.
We do not have any videos made on youtube yet, we will shortly.

Change your player gender:

I&#39;ve added the Make Over Mage to the home so when new players join, they can select there gender, she is located North-East of Edgeville if needed.

I&#39;ve also added brand new 562 cache because we recently had 377 cache, and we needed to update so new players can enjoy new graphics.

Rules:

Offensive Language
This type of language is know as F##K or N##ger etc, and if any player gets caught doing the following above they will be banned.

Account Trading or Selling
This rule is a rule that you should NOT ever do on RunePride, it will get your account muted, or this will put your account in jail, if this rule is broken.

Advertising Websites
We especially do-not allow players to advertise RS Gold sites, or any other RSPS content, if this rule gets broken many of times, you will be banned permanently.

Scamming
This is a serious rule, if any player on RunePride gets scammed, the player that scammed the other player, will be in Jail for 30 days max.

Malicious Software Sites
This is a very high risk, if somebody gives you a website url and you go to it, you could be infected. So for your safety do NOT trust anybody with URL&#39;s unless its from the Owner and its trusted sites, if any player gives you a website link and you get any type of virus, let the Owner know and he will do something about it.

Thank you, for reading our rules you may now download RunePride, have fun!

Also, if you do not ever see the owner playing on the server, its due to the owner adding new
things to the server or the owner is editing the server. He uses other player ideas. So if you have a idea that you want to share please leave a comment below and I will reply to it asap and I will add your idea to the server.

<p>Why not add pictures that show <span class="bbcode-i">unique features</span> within the server? The pictures you have now can be found in any server, literally. I’m not trying to sound like a dick here, just trying to help out.</p>
