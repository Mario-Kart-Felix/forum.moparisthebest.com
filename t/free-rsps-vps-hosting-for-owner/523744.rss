    <description>Hi, I have a windows 3Gig RAM 50GB SSD 5TB Bandwith VPS, I used to own servers in the past but I&#39;m not very intelligent now when it comes to making them again.

If you want to gather a team then go find one in the development teams board but if all you’re doing is stating that you have a VPS then you’ll struggle to find a team without joining an existing one.</p>
