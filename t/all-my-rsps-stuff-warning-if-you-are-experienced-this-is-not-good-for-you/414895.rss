    <description>First of all, I would like to give credits and say some of this stuff is useless or on this forums
Credits:
Me 5%
Everyone else 95%

This is basically all of the stuff I did on RSPS. I have my stuff from models to servers. And some of these are very old lol. This is good for noobs, anyone experienced will know this is shit. [b]I can post virus scans if you want me to.[/b]

Okay first off heres the modeling stuff. It has Gzip, Metasequioa, RIG by Frell, RSMV (doesn&#39;t work), DatMaker. The models that are there are: A bunch of custom items (like guns, weapons, recolored skillcapes), and a 481 model + item dump.

Secondly, here are some horrible projects I never got around to finish and because they got boring and stupid, One of them are All-Star Scape, Another is a Shard Server I don&#39;t want to do anymore, and the rest are deltascape.

Well thats about it, hope someone has better fun than I did with them.</description>
