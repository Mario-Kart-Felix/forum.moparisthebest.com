Lawscape is a new server created from scratch. Why should this server be so special? Well, it&#39;s special because it&#39;s made from blank. The entire server engine has been overhauled, created so there will be very minimal CPU usage.

Lawscape does not go without features, however. This engine enables the development team to further enhance your experience. Currently, the most popular feature that no other server may have, is insta-click. Insta-click is a separate engine built into the server that continuously scans for client packets, at a very high speed, and at the same time, uses 0% CPU on my computer. Instant-click means, the moment you want an action to happen, boom, it&#39;s done. No waiting 500 milliseconds for a packet to be received to the server. Massing is not a problem at all either.

Well, I bet you&#39;re already excited. You&#39;ll be expecting this server to be open at the latest for BETA: January 30th. The actual release will be around June/July

Unfortunately, I&#39;m going to need some help this time. I&#39;m quite busy with high school, and I won&#39;t be able to work a lot on this server. Lawscape needs a client too. I won&#39;t be hiring anybody to work on the server itself as I fear the source being leaked, but I will be hiring volunteers to help work on a client.

This server may even get to be hosted on a PSP! Once I figure out how to create a server connection from it, i&#39;ll be able to do this, and the server would be hosted for 24/7

Current features:
- Insta-click
- Walking (Old system*)
- Fast login
- Appearance

*[SIZE=6pt]This system is temporary. It will be replaced after many features get done.[/SIZE]

If you would like to help make a client, I&#39;d like to see some work you have done yourself. I&#39;d like to know that you know plenty Java.
