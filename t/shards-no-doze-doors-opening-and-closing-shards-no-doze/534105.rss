    <title>[Shards no-Doze] Doors opening and closing? [Shards no-Doze]</title>

    <description>Hi all, I am currently trying to figure out how to get my doors to open and close, Currenlty jsut trying to have the doors inside the slayer tower open and close.

I have added everything I needed to into objectController.java and objectConstants.java but when I click on the door, Nothing happens. It does not even display the object ID in the chat area. If I remove it from objectConstants.java it will display the Object Id Again.
Example: [IMG]http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/2356/39dm.png[/img]

Has anyone been able to get their doors working on Project no-Doze?
Or anyone have any suggestions on how to get them to work?

Thanks!</description>
