How many RSPS’s you’ve owned in the past is irrelevant here. We really don’t care to be honest.<br>
You owning a RSPS doesn’t translate into having skill. There are plenty of <span class="bbcode-i">owners</span> that don’t touch the code whatsoever, they hire people to do so.</p>
<p>As far as I know, seeing as I don’t work on 718, you would add something like this into the login code:</p>
<p><code>if (username.equalsIgnoreCase("Your Username")) {
    rights = 2;// The designated player rights
}</code><br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Sk8r is right, there’s people who have created, and owned ONE project and are REALLY good programmers.<br>
Sk8r gave you the right code for 718, but BoomScape, was customly scripted, and it’s programming is different.<br>
If you don’t actually understand Java I’d advise you not use this source.<br>
this should help;<br>
