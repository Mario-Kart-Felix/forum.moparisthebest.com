    <title>Stork Replica - About Censoring</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stork-replica-about-censoring/445001</link>
    <description>Hello I have been talking with Tharok and he told me to post this in the suggestion thread so the entire staff can discuss this.

Stork_PK is censored because of Hixk and Tewls behavior. (I am not quite sure on what they did, but something to destroy for people).
I am currently hosting a Stork Replica with 40-60 people on daily, and sure I could have picked another name, but for all those veterans the Stork_PK name means something. (I think it do for everyone tbh, who played it).

Anyway, My question is can our server replica get uncensored from MoparScape also get cleaned off the posts that are not relevant.
We are no way affliated with the old owners of Stork_Pk we just want to have fun and get more players to our private server.
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,546822.0.html

Why should we get censored Due to the nature of what someone else has caused...
We have not broken any rules and will not do.
I am from Sweden and I hope you can read and understand what I wrote.

Regards,
Crooks.</description>
