    <title>About when your servers are online!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/about-when-your-servers-are-online/110103</link>
    <description>so right i was wondering when people make a server and make it online and other people start going on it do they like leave the pc on all day and leave the server running or do they uno make certain times that they will start and close the server because i am making a server and i would def not be able to keep it open like 24/7, i would be able to have it up and running everyday but at certain times.
i keep thinking that if i do that then no one will join and play it coz it wont be online 24/7

anybody got any comments or advice on this issue???
