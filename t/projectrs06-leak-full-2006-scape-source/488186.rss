Paypal dispute for work done:

As a result, here is the PRS06 source. Since it is not theirs, they have no copywrite in place, I signed no contracts saying I wouldn&#39;t release it, and I&#39;m not scared of that 420 blazing moron anyway so here you go: Download rs06.rar @ UppIT

Note to mods: Remove the link if it is not allowed, but please keep the post since it is personal life and not server versus server related.

So here&#39;s my payback for gaining back your money, you lose even more! This includes the work I did.[/QUOTE]
