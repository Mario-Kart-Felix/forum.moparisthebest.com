    <title>Rep command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rep-command/239983</link>
    <description>I was bored, so I decided to add a simple rep system, Really it&#39;s just two commands, one to rep someone and one to check your rep
so I have this so far:
[code]
if (command.startsWith(&quot;rep&quot;)){//rep command by sunshinebear
  string victim = command.substring(4)//tells the command to look for the players name in the 4th space 
        (rep==+1)
	sendMessage(&quot;you have repped &quot;+victim);
 
 }catch (exception e){// if they messed up on the command, basically for error
 sendMessage(&quot;player &quot;+victim+&quot; not found&quot;);

 }
[/code]
but my problem is on the (rep==+1), it&#39;s repping the person that&#39;s entering the command, I want to know how to have it send the points to the person that is to be repped.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 29, 2008, 08:17:28 pm[/size][hr] no one knows?</description>
