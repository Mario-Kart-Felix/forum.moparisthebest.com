    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs-without-free-trade/460179</link>
    <description>Earlier today I saw a thread at RS forums about bringing back trade limits. I personally am up for the idea, sure I will miss giving/receiving donations but I think it is best for the game. If the trade limit returns then maybe the goldfarming bots will reduce and gambling will finally die, but I think pkers would strongly be affected leading to riots once again.

What are your opinions on this and do you believe bringing back trade limits would save the game at some point?</description>

When I said asshole, its not intentional I just do it and don’t care enough to stop doing it.<br>
Have you forgotten I look down at people etc a lot, its not intention its just I feel people like you are pretty dumb because you act like it in my opinion. Notice I said in my opinion, so don’t take it offensively. Just saying what I think like you said what you think however I suspect yours was actually an attempt to be insulting.</p>

              <p>I completely understand where you are coming from, and I still don’t care. I know you may think that calling someone an idiot is a terrible terrible thing, all I can say is welcome to the internet. There’s a lot worse shit here, this forum isn’t a kindergarten classroom, or a place for you specifically to try and impose your views on everyone (which for you specifically is why a lot of your reports get ignored). There’s still a line of course.</p>
<p>And yes, a lot of the time I ignore it. Usually I’ll listen to someone once, and then try to explain my actions (or lack of actions) to them. If they continue after that, it’s clear we just have a difference in opinion and there’s no reason for me to listen to them anymore, and they can go complain to Taharok instead (love you Taharok).</p>

              <p>Thats exactly whats wrong ^, you should care.<br>
Of course you can’t please everyone but you shouldn’t ignore them (us in this case) because you believe we are wrong.</p>
<p>Even if we are wrong (not saying we are), you should try to understand where we are coming from. Gaining a better understanding of things means you can deal with things better, ignoring things is the complete opposite.<br>
Saying you don’t care suggests you ignore it.</p>
<p>Moparscape isn’t a big ass community where nobody knows each other, its a community where a lot of people know each other. You should take time out of your day to understand why we feel like this and if you truly understood you’d deal with it a lot better than you are. But hey as I said before, I always expect too much from people.</p>

I agree with this completely. If your stupid enough to believe that a person can trim your Armour, then you shouldn’t even be playing. Jagex knows it too, let the people waste their time. I enjoy free trade because I am not stupid enough to fall for the idiotic scams. Most people are like that too, just because the younger population can’t have common sense then why punish all of us? I remember when there was no free trade, the runescape economy mostly revolved around the G.E. which sucked, I loved the street prices and stuff before that. Eh anyways yeah <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
