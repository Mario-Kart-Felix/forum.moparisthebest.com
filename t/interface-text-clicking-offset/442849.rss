    <title>Interface Text Clicking Offset</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/interface-text-clicking-offset/442849</link>
    <description>Hi everyone! I&#39;ve added an awt MenuBar to my client and moved the game window down so that the menubar didn&#39;t cover it up and moved all the main interfaces click offset as well. I&#39;ve come across one small bug with the chat window interfaces such as &quot;Click here to continue&quot; and &quot;Choose an option:&quot; interfaces that didnt offset correctly. If anyone might be able to give me some pointers that would be nice. I am done with the client version and this bug is the only thing keeping me from uploading it.
I am using deltascape v11 client and what I&#39;ve done so far is in Applet_Sub1 in the following methods: mousePressed(), nouseDragged(), mouseMoved(). Anyways, is there any other place that deals with chat window interfaces?</description>
