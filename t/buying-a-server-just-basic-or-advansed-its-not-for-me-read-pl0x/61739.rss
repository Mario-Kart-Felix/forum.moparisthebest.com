    <description>Hello im the Hello my name is from alot of websites ANd

i am working at a particular website that needs a server even a basic server is fine

If possible id like a few things:
the name to be
Rs2fun.????.???? (? is whatever u use to make it)

THINGS THAT ARE A MUST
i need to be able to control everything
It has to be a pk server (even copy a tut i dont care...)

I need to be able to edit this as im adding a few things:
shops
people
Rules
and a few things besides

So if its basic its ok just needs to start out a pk server... PLEASE

i dont know how youd like to be paid:
You can work at my site and be co host mod?
You can be paid in rs gp?
You can be paid in gratitude ? LOL

Anyway if this is against any rule (i saw no rule but if it is i apoligize)
