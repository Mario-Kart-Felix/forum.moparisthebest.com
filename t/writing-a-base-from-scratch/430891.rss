    <title>Writing a base...from scratch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/writing-a-base-from-scratch/430891</link>
    <description>Hello everyone!

Today I am looking to find some help on how to write my own base from scratch. I know there used to be a tutorial on here, but I can&#39;t seem to find it. I don&#39;t just want a source and have to edit it. I want to learn about the structure of the files, so I can know what goes where.

If any of you know of a tutorial that can show me where to start and what I need that would be great. Thanks!

P.S. I have been looking for a week for a tutorial for this, but I can&#39;t find one. So I have tried to look for one</description>

<p>Thanks man. Those are some good ideas. Though, I was having some problems running Hyperion. I haven’t tried RS2HD, but I will look into it.</p>
