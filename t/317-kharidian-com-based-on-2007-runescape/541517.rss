[B]Kharidian.com VPS Hosted 24/7 online![/B]
Kharidian.com is a Runescape Private Server based on 2007 Runescape. Our main task is bringing the oldschool community back to life! Runescape in 2007 was a great game for all players. Personally I could play it 24 hours a day. The choice that Runescape made to change the game was bad. Not only in my opinion, but for all players that time. Kharidian.com will not make that changes, we keep it oldschool!
