              <p>Please guys learn how to portforward correctly, it works on every router. All you have to do is ask someone who knows, and if you don’t know anyone who knows then go to <a href="http://www.portforward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.portforward.com</a></p>
<p>HOW TO PORTFORWARD ANY ROUTER;</p>
<ol>
<li>Look under your router, it will state a USERNAME and a PASSWORD</li>
<li>Go to your computer and open CMD and type in ipconfig</li>
<li>Look at your IP, it should be something like 192.168.x.x (replace x’s with numbers)</li>
<li>Open your browser (any browser) and type in that IP in this format: 192.168.x.x (replace x’s with numbers)</li>
<li>It will ask you for a log in, type in the username and password you found under your router. IF THIS DOES NOT WORK, either another user of the router has changed it or if you are on a wireless a skiddie have connected to it and changed it. Only way to solve this is to reset it. Just find out which kind of router u have and google how to reset “+routerName+”</li>
<li>Look for a firewall/portforward tab and put in the selected port &amp; your LAN IP address.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow these steps correctly you will see that it works for ANY router out there, please do this first. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>

              <p>Have you tried changing the port then changing it back? Make sure your servers are all closed first though.</p>
