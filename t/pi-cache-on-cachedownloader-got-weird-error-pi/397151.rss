    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-cache-on-cachedownloader-got-weird-error-pi/397151</link>
    <description>oke so i made a webclient from the scratch,

so now my normal client + webclient have the same problem 

when the cache is downloaded is unpacking well...
 then i log in, i can see the chat box saying welcome to nightmareX  ur rank is 3 atm

but the playing screen stays black with &quot;loading please wait&quot; on it 

on the webclient and client it does that, so i thougt hmm weird maybe i made a mistake by zipping the cache

so i looked in program files  and cant find my fucking cache.... its just not there i was sure and double checkedcd it i called it nightmareX_cache  i even tryed it on my laptop

so any one got a idea?</description>
