--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

i&#39;m setting up a new source, (i&#39;ve done it before) alot of people 20+ decided to want to use another source, so i&#39;ve decided to do so. i&#39;ve got everything set up, new cache, new client, new source. i was able to log on locally but others couldn&#39;t come online, i setup a new no-ip but there is several places where it should be changed and i&#39;m not too sure what to do. because this source is way different. if someone could help out that would be great.
I&#39;ll post my clients &quot;client.java&quot; and if someone could help edit to make it go for a no ip. just show me where i need to put the no-ip by instead of 127.0.0.1 
Please let me  PM you teamviewer info and i will gladly rep if you can fix. Thank you
