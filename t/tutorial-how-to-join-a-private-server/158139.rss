    <description>&gt; [TUTORIAL]How to join a private server.

made by 0elvemage0

Step 1: Starting the Client

your gonna wanna start off by going to Moparscape (www.moparisthebest.com) &lt;--- If this is the first time running moparscape, you will get a little pop like the real runescape saying if you want to run the application 
just click on &quot;always trust products from moparscape or whatever it may say, and click &quot;Run&quot; after moparscape is loaded you will need to find a server.
you can do that by typing in our server IP Address or going to Server Status Checker (http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php) &lt;---Click


Step 2. Joining a server


its very easy to join a server as long as you got the IP and the Port number correct, before we get into the Ports Option you need to learn how to join a server,

Okay first click on &quot;File&quot; 

After clicking on file and clicking &quot;New Server&quot;, 


now type in the Ip address you got for a server,

Now click &quot;Ok&quot;

Now you should be on the main login screen with everything set up right for the server your connecting to click on &quot;Enter User&quot;


since you entered the server through &quot;File&quot; it will show up in the server ip part of login under the username and password bit,

after clicking that, youll be at the username and password screen, DO NOT USE YOUR REAL RUNESCAPE USERNAME AND PASSWORD! 

just type in anything that you can remember for this server. remember, every server yo go to youll have to do this, sometimes your name will be taken and sometimes not.
but anyways, anyname will work,Any name and Password.Just make one up!

Step 3. Choosing a Port 


Choosing a Port is simple and easy. most servers are ran off of two main port numbers those being 43594 and 5555, 
now in our situation, the runekeep server has 3 main ports 43594 = Public Port - 43595 = RK Members Only - 43596 = testing port

to enter a port number for a corresponding server, follow the tut below.

go to &quot;File&quot; then move down to &quot;New Port&quot;

this screen will pop up, enter the port number to the server and click &quot;OK&quot; and your ready to play.

hope you understand this, cause i wont type it all again. lol.
