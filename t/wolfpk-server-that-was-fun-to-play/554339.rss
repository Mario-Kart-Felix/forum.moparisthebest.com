    <description>Hey guys, how are you? 

You may heard me, if You have played oldschool servers like CreativeScape or VexillumRS. I founded them both, in fact crs has been running for 5 yrs now. The latest version wasn&#39;t so successful, so I have decided to get back to roots and work on a fun server, people would enjoy.  :)

I&#39;ve enjoyed playing old servers like delta, frugoo, dodian, omega. They all had something cool on them. It also teach me a lot stuff, that would make hell of a server. 

When I look at todays servers, I don&#39;t see anything like the servers there once used to be... they was fun!

this is gonna be home. You have 16 portals and npcs that tells you where they lead. It&#39;s very easy to transport and doesn&#39;t take much experience for new player to start!

the home is gonna be brimhaven

this is the shops place, majority of items you do buy there. You start server with just 200k and items like whip cost 10m, it also sells a lot of other stuff like dragon, med goes 20m, dsq 40m, dlegs 50m, dchain 200m.

whats unique is that we sell rares for high price. It takes lot of grind to get these, but people are motivated to play!

when everyone have armor, they go to pk. You do pk with items that have worth. On all of the pk servers no item has value, so people usually don&#39;t even loot their kills. On here, you do want to loot it all haha

[img]http://i.imgur.com/yOR4O3G.gif[/img]
objects training, that gives more exp than fighting with npcs for people who want to get to pk faster. You don&#39;t gain drops, so its fine.

There are no teleports. You transport around using portals, so its realistic. On home, you do use any of the 16 portals and then each place had this red portal that leads back to home. :) 

We also have bank booths a lot, hence people don&#39;t really like wasting time.

<p>mate… server like this is like classic rsps, they were fudgeing FUN to play. This beats Soulsplit and shit servers like that, why, because 10+ bosses and 200+ features doesnt make it fun. Fun makes fact how the process on it is. If u havent been on to test it, you should probably, stfu.<br>

<p>This will only be fun for those who played this type of server, like myself. I would only play this because I grew up playing servers like this, but even still, with the content that servers have today, it would be extremely difficult to go back and enjoy such a thing like this simply due to lack of things to do, lack of players and lack of everything that you would expect from a modern day server. It’s like going back and using a pc from the 90’s instead of a high end gaming pc today just to feel nostalgic.</p>
<p>Good luck though![/quote]<br>
give it a try sir</p>

this is gonna be home. You have 16 portals and npcs that tells you where they lead. It’s very easy to transport and doesn’t take much experience for new player to start!</p>

this is the shops place, majority of items you do buy there. You start server with just 200k and items like whip cost 10m, it also sells a lot of other stuff like dragon, med goes 20m, dsq 40m, dlegs 50m, dchain 200m.</p>

whats unique is that we sell rares for high price. It takes lot of grind to get these, but people are motivated to play!</p>

when everyone have armor, they go to pk. You do pk with items that have worth. On all of the pk servers no item has value, so people usually don’t even loot their kills. On here, you do want to loot it all haha</p>

objects training, that gives more exp than fighting with npcs for people who want to get to pk faster. You don’t gain drops, so its fine.</p>

<p>There are no teleports. You transport around using portals, so its realistic. On home, you do use any of the 16 portals and then each place had this red portal that leads back to home. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>We also have bank booths a lot, hence people don’t really like wasting time.</p>
