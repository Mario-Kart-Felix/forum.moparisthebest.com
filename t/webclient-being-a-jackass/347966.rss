    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-being-a-jackass/347966</link>
    <description>Ok, My webclient keeps trying to connect to localhost, (127.0.0.1) but when I&#39;m telling it to connect to my IP.  This only happens with my webclient.  Either cause it&#39;s jarred or it&#39;s a webclient I don&#39;t know.  I have No-IP open, my server&#39;s run.bat is open.  Variables set.  Port forwarded correctly:
