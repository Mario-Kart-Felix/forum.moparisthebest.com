    <title>OpenSource Runescape Development (Any sources welcome)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/opensource-runescape-development-any-sources-welcome/225375</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve started a project on SF.net aimed at improving and adding features to many of the server sources out there in hopes of creating an altogether better RS2 server.

I&#39;m very experienced in Java programming but, working with the HybridScape source at it&#39;s last SVN revision isn&#39;t easy. Many of the programmers for HybridScape had no idea what they were doing, and were very unprofessional about any of the source.
I&#39;m hoping to improve this, or at least make it a bit easier to add things into the server instead of poking around in Client.java for everything.

If you have sufficient Java knowledge, you want to improve the current sources, or you want to start your own development version on the project I would be more than happy to have you help. :) (You must be able to use SVN. This isn&#39;t hard with a client like TortoiseSVN)

Project Home (Pretty bare, just added it):
