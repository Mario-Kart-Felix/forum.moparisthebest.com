<blockquote>The Tortoise challenged Achilles to a race, claiming that he would win as long as Achilles gave him a small head start. Achilles laughed at this, for of course he was a mighty warrior and swift of foot, whereas the Tortoise was heavy and slow.
â€œHow big a head start do you need?â€ he asked the Tortoise with a smile.
â€œTen meters,â€ the latter replied.
Achilles laughed louder than ever. â€œYou will surely lose, my friend, in that case,â€ he told the Tortoise, â€œbut let us race, if you wish it.â€
â€œOn the contrary,â€ said the Tortoise, â€œI will win, and I can prove it to you by a simple argument.â€
â€œGo on then,â€ Achilles replied, with less confidence than he felt before. He knew he was the superior athlete, but he also knew the Tortoise had the sharper wits, and he had lost many a bewildering argument with him before this.
â€œSuppose,â€ began the Tortoise, â€œthat you give me a 10-meter head start. Would you say that you could cover that 10 meters between us very quickly?â€
â€œVery quickly,â€ Achilles affirmed.
â€œAnd in that time, how far should I have gone, do you think?â€
â€œPerhaps a meter â€“ no more,â€ said Achilles after a moment's thought.
â€œVery well,â€ replied the Tortoise, â€œso now there is a meter between us. And you would catch up that distance very quickly?â€
â€œVery quickly indeed!â€
â€œAnd yet, in that time I shall have gone a little way farther, so that now you must catch that distance up, yes?â€
<p>â€œYe-es,â€ said Achilles slowly.<br>
â€œAnd while you are doing so, I shall have gone a little way farther, so that you must then catch up the new distance,â€ the Tortoise continued smoothly.<br>
Achilles said nothing.<br>
â€œAnd so you see, in each moment you must be catching up the distance between us, and yet I â€“ at the same time â€“ will be adding a new distance, however small, for you to catch up again.â€<br>
â€œIndeed, it must be so,â€ said Achilles wearily.<br>
â€œAnd so you can never catch up,â€ the Tortoise concluded sympathetically.<br>
â€œYou are right, as always,â€ said Achilles sadly â€“ and conceded the race.</p>

<p>The turtle moves about 1/10 of the speed of Achilles.</p>
<blockquote>â€œSuppose,â€ began the Tortoise, â€œthat you give me a 10-meter head start. Would you say that you could cover that 10 meters between us very quickly?â€
â€œVery quickly,â€ Achilles affirmed.
â€œAnd in that time, how far should I have gone, do you think?â€
â€œPerhaps a meter â€“ no more,â€ said Achilles after a moment's thought.</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, by the time Achilles has walked 15 meters, the turtle will have walked 1.5, therefore creating a new distance for Achilles to cross. When you have walked 1.5, the turtle will have walked a massive .15. As long as the turtle has a headstart, he will always be ahead.</p>

<p>I guess your saying every unit of time has it’s own unique probabilities of any event occuring, but that’s not really true. Infinite divisiblity does not work:</p>
<p>[quote]The Tortoise challenged Achilles to a race, claiming that he would win as long as Achilles gave him a small head start. Achilles laughed at this, for of course he was a mighty warrior and swift of foot, whereas the Tortoise was heavy and slow.<br>
How big a head start do you need? he asked the Tortoise with a smile.<br>
Ten meters, the latter replied.<br>
Achilles laughed louder than ever. You will surely lose, my friend, in that case, he told the Tortoise, but let us race, if you wish it.<br>
On the contrary, said the Tortoise, I will win, and I can prove it to you by a simple argument.<br>
Go on then, Achilles replied, with less confidence than he felt before. He knew he was the superior athlete, but he also knew the Tortoise had the sharper wits, and he had lost many a bewildering argument with him before this.<br>
Suppose, began the Tortoise, that you give me a 10-meter head start. Would you say that you could cover that 10 meters between us very quickly?<br>
Very quickly, Achilles affirmed.<br>
And in that time, how far should I have gone, do you think?<br>
Perhaps a meter  no more, said Achilles after a moment’s thought.<br>
Very well, replied the Tortoise, so now there is a meter between us. And you would catch up that distance very quickly?<br>
Very quickly indeed!<br>
And yet, in that time I shall have gone a little way farther, so that now you must catch that distance up, yes?</p>
<p>Ye-es, said Achilles slowly.<br>
And while you are doing so, I shall have gone a little way farther, so that you must then catch up the new distance, the Tortoise continued smoothly.<br>
Achilles said nothing.<br>
And so you see, in each moment you must be catching up the distance between us, and yet I  at the same time  will be adding a new distance, however small, for you to catch up again.<br>
Indeed, it must be so, said Achilles wearily.<br>
And so you can never catch up, the Tortoise concluded sympathetically.<br>
You are right, as always, said Achilles sadly  and conceded the race.[/quote]</p>

<p>So your point is that nothing will happen without giving a warning first?<br>

<p>wow the guy is a noob, as you see in the end as the tuturle dude goes 1/2 your speed there for you will catch up with him in…15 meters…</p>

<p>Therefore, by the time Achilles has walked 15 meters, the turtle will have walked 1.5, therefore creating a new distance for Achilles to cross. When you have walked 1.5, the turtle will have walked a massive .15. As long as the turtle has a headstart, he will always be ahead.[/quote]</p>
<p>so after he wen the .15 then the turtle would have gone .015</p>
<p>then after he went .015 the turtle would have gone .0015, and so one, beside you know hwo small .0015 is i can easly sprint ahead of you right there, i mean for havens sake, if you go 1/10 my speed then 9/10 of a meter ill will be ahead, so i would still win</p>

<p>You haven’t proved you would ever catch the turtle, just that you would reduce the distance between you to a very small amount. You would still never pass the turtle, even if the distance between you became a tiny number.</p>
