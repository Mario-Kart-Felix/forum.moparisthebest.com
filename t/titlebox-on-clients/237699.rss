    <title>Titlebox on clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/titlebox-on-clients/237699</link>
    <description>Well Im just asking the community to help me in a problem involving the titlebox image shown in 317,377, ect clients. Im using a 377 client but i realized that my titlebox image isnt loading from the picture that i directed it to. It just loads the old runescape titlebox which looks ugly to me. I went to class30sub2,sub1,sub1 and searched titlebox and changed it to load the titlebox image that i got but it still doesnt load. Anyone knows were does the client load this from? :p</description>
