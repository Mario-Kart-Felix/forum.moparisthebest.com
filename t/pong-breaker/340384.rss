    <title>Pong Breaker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pong-breaker/340384</link>
    <description>So this is a little game I had to create for my Data Structures course. It&#39;s a little 2d game that&#39;s a mix between Pong and Brick Breaker. Obviously since it was created for Data Structures, it does in fact include a Data Structure: the Linked List. It uses a doubly linked list; however, we only used the singly linked features ha. The algorithm for the ball is not complete. It works fine when the balls hit the sides of the block, but not the top or bottom.

I&#39;m only including the executable .jar file for this. If you feel so compelled to decompile the class files, fine by me. If anyone knows how to fix our problem with redirecting the ball once it hits the top and bottom of the blocks, feel free to let me know what can be changed. To calculate the side that the ball hits, we used the arctangent of the ball, in relation with the block, to find the angle in degrees that the ball was travelling. If it&#39;s travelling between 45 and -45 degrees, that ball has hit the sides of a block, else it&#39;s hit the top or bottom.

The blocks are loaded into a linked list because the only operations that the blocks require are insertion and deletion. All of which take O(1), constant time, to complete. Thus, we chose the linked list for storing our objects.

Screenshot of gameplay:

W and S: Control the left player
Up Arrow and Down Arrow: Control the right player

Anyways, the .jar is attached. Enjoy, and let me know if anything should be fixed for better performance. Please don&#39;t complain about the repainting :) Also, I apologize if the ball speed is too fast or too slow. It depends on the computer&#39;s processing speed. I&#39;m sure there are ways around this problem, making it more dynamic, but given the time frame to complete the project, this was not a big focus of ours. If you want to change the ball speed, it&#39;s easy enough to figure it out.

<p>Interesting tutorial so far, thanks for the link. I’ll be sure to read the rest in my free time.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking RuneScape, we used our own. Created in photoshop. Coincidentally it only looks similar to RuneScape’s <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Where will this move if I don’t post the source? And if someone can’t open a .jar file and decompile 1 of the 5 class files, they shouldn’t be worthy of helping me with the two problems that we have. I’ve pretty much given the source…</p>

<p>I’m not necessarily looking for help. The game’s already been completed and turned in so it doesn’t matter if I receive help or not.</p>
