    <title>Universal Micro Client client MD5 hashchecker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/universal-micro-client-client-md5-hashchecker/396765</link>
    <description>This is a hash checker that downloads the cache as a single zip file and then executes the client jar from the cache folder. The client does not have to be a part of the browser to still work on any OS. This is not a web client and is designed to work with the DarkQuest client but others should work too. It must download the entire client cache archive if the MD5 hash changes but that is better if you want to avoid hundreds of web server connections if you have many users trying to download small files at the same time. (Staminus DDoS problem mentioned by Kryptix earlier) It also helps cut down on development time by reducing the number of MD5 hashes you must keep track of and avoids forcing users to re-download the Universal Micro Client if you decide to add additional files to the game client.

The deployment client download should be only 17kb. Providing you have a good webhost or use a Dropbox public folder (providing you are not seeing much traffic!) then the client download should take 3-10 seconds during the initial cache download for players.

This was built from several different sources and I have made a number of changes to it to clean it up, add comments for readers, and I have added instructions for how to use it.
