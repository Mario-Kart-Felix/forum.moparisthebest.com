              <p>I removed your password, Its generally a bad idea to allow random people to access your computer without ever talking to them previously.</p>
<p>Also, there are several threads regarding server set-up if you would simply look in the tutorial section <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>First of all, you sir are an idiot, why would u post the ip and such here of all places, i would just give it to someone who would help u, also, teamviewer is only a good way to go if u know the person who is on it, or they might go to a sight, dl a virus, and then boom, there goes windows or w/e, also there are many many guides on moparscape that say how to set up a server, also there is google.</p>
