    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-game-highscore-help/295587</link>
    <description>Ok, I have everything setup for my hiscores in-game. I have the Scoreboard integrated with the interface but i cant figure out how to add the highscores on it with out me having to update it manually. I am wanting it to show the players with the most PK points on my server and I am using a delta source. Can anyone help me? Rep Will be given to the person who can answer my question.</description>
