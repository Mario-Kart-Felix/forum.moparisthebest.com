    <title>I can&#39;t get my shop to work, somebody please help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-get-my-shop-to-work-somebody-please-help/321308</link>
    <description>Okay. I have made the shop, and set prices, and added items into the shop.
All of the other shops work, except this one.
When I buy an item, it doesn&#39;t take the money out of my inventory.
It does in fact require that amount, but it doesn&#39;t take it away once purchased..
AND It says there are &#39;10&#39; items in the shop. And when you buy one that number does not change. Somebody please help me.</description>
