    <title>[Dementhium]How can I make a command open an interface with text?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dementhium-how-can-i-make-a-command-open-an-interface-with-text/440071</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to create a ::guide command for my server.  I want an interface with the desired text to be opened upon the typing of the command.  Does anyone know how this kind of thing could be possible?  Help is much appreciated.
EDIT: Found out for myself while waiting for a reponse.</description>
