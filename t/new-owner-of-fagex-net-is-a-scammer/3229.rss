    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;This forum has benn temporarily CLOSED by Rogue. It will re-open soon. For more info contact rogue@jaghax.com (MSN)


This is an email you should have recieved:

Subject: Firefly + Blueflames = Scammers

Message: They bought fagex just to scam. They scammed a number of people and we have proof. It all started when firefly bought fagex, he told most staff right away he was seaslash, but his ways has changed. He was seaslash, seaslash was an old scammer.

He made BlueFlames head admin out of nowhere. He used to be Josh Vasco, and he got banned for scamming.

They scammed, put Fagex down. I came online and went into a conversation with a shitload of people, all telling me stuff. I put the board back online, and we banned Firefly and Blueflames. We have Rogue making copies of the database and everything.

Do not worry, everything should be back to normal soon enough, we might not have the domain fagex.net, but something similar.

Expect to hear more.

- Fagex staff&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#39;m also really mad because that prick scammed me of $60. So uh yeah, the good thing is that I have his address :)</description>

Horray i’m fucking home with my sources. Well now I can all tell you the Story of yesterdays “Staff Convo”</p>
<p>It all started yesterday afternoon when Ghost showed me this topic (which was soon DELETED, not MOVED like Firefly said). This shows Firefly and Blueflames being revealed.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>I then dicussed it with a few other staff members and we werent sure what to do. So I then added everyone that was on my Staff msn contact list into 1 converstaion. Then 1 by 1 we eventrually had pretty much all the staff in one big converstation.</p>
<p>At first it was just fucking Havoc. People accusing this and saying that without any proof. Then we got kozmo added and he said that Seaslash never paid him for having him train his acount (See pic at bottem). We all then just discussed what was going on. Soon after Fireflies story was released he shut down the forums, Why? Well lets see.</p>
<p>Maybe</p>
<ol>
<li>To stop this from being spread by post</li>
<li>Stop this from being spread by pm</li>
<li>Try and slow down everyone knowing about what he did/plans to do</li>
</ol>
<p>Well we see we’re fucked for the moment. Firefly did shut down the forums so our only hope was having someone get into the Cpanel and bring them back up. That person, was bego. Now Firefly was too stupid to de-admin Bego and Blizzind. So When bego got online (Alteast an hour after the chat had started ((FFS BEGO! Lol)) ) he brought the forums back up. He admined Humble and he annouced what was going on. We first Banned Firefly and Blueflames then preceeded to get him away from the database. Who was this master in disguise? It was Rouge. I’m not quite sure how he had access to the database but fucking glory he did. After Firefly brought the forums back and got banned again Rouge took his privaledges off the hosting for a bit (or something like that). So now we have full access to the forums! HORRAY! We quickly made a database backup (since Juans was a bit outdated) and then discussed a new name for the forums. Things settled down a bit at this point and we were all mellow and stuff so I left. I watched a movie and came back and found out we’d decided that the forums were going to be relocated at: www. Fagex Under ground .net – stupid filter &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Why fagex? 1. <a href="http://FagexReloaded.net" rel="nofollow noopener">FagexReloaded.net</a> sounded lame. 2. Firefly has copyright to <a href="http://Fagex.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Fagex.net</a> 3. <a href="http://Fagex.Com" rel="nofollow noopener">Fagex.Com</a> was already made by Firefly for scamming.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Now a note to anyone who stays:</p>
<p>Goodluck, beware, have a goodtime. I’ve decided to leave all this behinde me and move on to a place where I can remorese and have fun. Someday i’ll look back and say “Damn… I was there”</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Oh, sicne i’m leaving my offcial &lt;3 list type thing</p>
<p>Crypt- Too good a friend to describe. I beleive he’s mad at me now for being part of what happened lsat night<br>
Whisper- See you at the fagex <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
Bego- Just met you but your hella cool, thanks for helpig us out<br>
Sorry, I could only really mention them. They’re my big time friends here at Fagex, so yea. Sorry to everyone NOT listed</p>
<p>the new fagex is at this…<br>

<p>Lol, yes, I’m surprised at how well you handled you’re hosting problem as maturely as you did. I was hoping for an all out war between you and your hoster. I guess I just misunderestimate your temper :P.</p>
