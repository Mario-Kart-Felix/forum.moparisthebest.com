        <p>okay this may be kinda long but really im new to coding and was wondering if maybe some one could explain a few tips or even link me to something helpful.<br>
I may not just have one specific question but i want to learn everything i can about coding, ect; and because i am new everything just seems so confusing.</p>
<p>a couple of years ago i guess you could say i leeched a delta, changed the shops around, changed name, changed max hits, added teles, npcs, changed drops around, and prices ect. basically i just read enough guides to change very basic things and i hosted it for about around 6-8months avg. around 30players online at a time.</p>
<p>I am just now getting back into this kinda stuff and im realizing that delta is hated on very badly, and also this time rather than just leeching and changing the source soo little before hosting; i would like to learn about coding to the points that i can really change things and make a decent server.<br>
Last time i attempted this i found guides for nearly everything so i just changed the things they said and never really learned to read the codes.</p>
<p>things id like to learn:</p>
<ol>
<li>how to properly read the coding. (understand it)</li>
<li>what server source &amp; client i should download to start with?</li>
<li>if i have problems with getting the client/ source to work so i can log on what should i look for first? (antileeches, ports, ips)</li>
<li>any other info that may be helpful to a begginer coder like myself.</li>
</ol>
<p>what i want my server to end up like:<br>
-average combat xp rates<br>
-harder/ little more time consuming skill xp rates<br>
-pvm/ slayer/ bossing should be very important for econemy<br>
-god wars dung/ kill count/ all four bosses<br>
-clue scrolls<br>
-late 2007 weapons (ags, claws. barrows, whips, god wars iteams being best things) - no vesta, status, torva ect.<br>
-summoning (atleast non combat ones like yaks, tortise, ect.)<br>
-lots of people wanting to pk</p>
<p>There is lots of servers i played that i liked and get ideas from<br>
grinderscape, 2speced, soulsplit, 317 near reality, united pkz, deltascape, ect</p>
<p>Please dont flame guys; like i said im new and just want to learn so that next time i attempt to run a rsps which im hoping i get the chance to doo soon that it is a very good/ fun one that is not BASSICALLY the exact same as another like last time.</p>

        <p>First of all, what you did to the delta before is not coding… second of all try Udemy, it costs money but the tutorials are VERY useful. Start with RuneSource, easy to understand. Answer to <span class="hashtag">#3</span>, anti leeches are last, usually it is the IP that is incorrect, Port is almost never incorrect. OR the client is not compatible with the source. Answer to <span class="hashtag">#4</span>, try to begin by changing variables and strings that are called by methods to see what they do, then try to add your own methods that do special things.

<p>Thank you i will google and look into the udemy thing and i am willing to spend money but i have not decided how much. while i was waiting on a reply i dled hybrid pvp v2[pi] with when i tried to logg on it worked properly and atm im just walking around thinking of things i would like to change in the future.<br>
so far i see:<br>
-no quest or anything (id like to make my own at some point)<br>
-tav dung has no walls only the floor and the npcs (looks like crap and i hope it is an easy fix)<br>
-nearly ALL npc’s hit straight 0s. (thats just dumb)<br>
-when i use ags,ss, whip, dds, ect i can switch attack styles and gain xp in diff stats; but the hit animations look the same.<br>
-when i go into the skill cape shop the client freezes</p>
<p>that is all ive had time to check out so far.</p>

<p>Last thing you want to use is a Project Insanity Source (also called PI), they are badly written and very different from others. Don’t use any server with customs at the beginning, stick to the basics. Also those missing map things are because those PI caches are REALLY messed up.</p>

        <p>oh i gotcha; this pi base also has about 5monsters (bosses) that are not even in real rs and they are like completely unkillable even with maxed stats they was hitting constant 50+ on me n tanked my hits and the hp bars kept refillign when it went to 0. also i would hit a 0 and there hp bar would go down so yea it bassically proves your point.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z7Un7KsaA8" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z7Un7KsaA8</a><br>
that is a pk video from a long time ago on me n m8s server but i forgot what server base it was and i rly liked it a lot n it was easy to code…</p>
<p>If you think that was is bad idea to use aswell let me know and if possible ill check it out if you link me too a good one…</p>
<p>also is it possible to make a really good server out of the basic delta? i think delta is easy to change things on but idk if i can add summoning, god wars, proper godsword stances + animation, ect.</p>

        <p>Seeing as this thread is very broad and doesn’t belong in any section specifically, I’m afraid I’ll have to close this thread.<br>

To answer a few of your questions:</p>
<p>[ul][li]1. There’s an extensive amount of tutorials, guides, and textbooks available at your leisure. Not only that, but they’re free. The most reliable source available roots directly from Oracle, the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">javadocs</a>, more specifically the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ReallyBigIndex</a>. The terminology might throw you off at first, but googling these terms will prove useful and make it easier to understand.[/li]<br>
[li]3. The help sections are here for when you need help with a specific problem that you’ve encountered and can’t seem to fix on your lonesome. Remember that a majority of those who help in this section will not give you your code on a silver platter, they will expect you to have at least a basic understanding of what it is they’re showing you.[/li]<br>
[li]4. Don’t start learning to program with a private server. Start with reading the Java documentation and begin to write your own programs. Once you feel like you have a decent grasp of the basics of Java, and if you’re still interested, then try your hand at a private server. Also. if you want to make your life a lot easier while programming, be sure to do all of your programming in the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Eclipse IDE</a> or other <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=java+ide" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Java IDE’s</a>.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding help and you don’t want to post in the help sections for any reason, myself and a lot more members are willing to help through private messaging. Good luck.</p>
