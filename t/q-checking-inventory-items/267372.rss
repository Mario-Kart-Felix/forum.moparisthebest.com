    <title>[Q] Checking Inventory Items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/q-checking-inventory-items/267372</link>
    <description>I have made an NPC that will trade you items if you have a certain amount of another item. However, I have stumbled to the fact that he will just give you items, even if you don&#39;t have the item he requires lol. Also for example: If you have 1 iron bar and need 2 iron bars for the 2nd option item, he&#39;ll still give you it with 1 iron bar. Do you know how I can prevent this from happening? Such as where abouts I enter code to see if they&#39;ve got the required items before he gives them the other item, and if they don&#39;t how can I make him not give them. Here&#39;s a case from the code.

[code]case 0: //1st Item
										world.getDelayedEventHandler().add(new ShortEvent(owner) {
											public void action() {
													if(owner.getInventory().countId(1332) &lt; 1) {
													owner.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;You have run out of bars&quot;);
													running = false;
													owner.setBusy(false);
												}
											else
												owner.getInventory().remove(1332, 1);
												owner.getInventory().add(new InvItem(81, 1));
												owner.getActionSender().sendInventory();
												npc.unblock();
											}
										});[/code]

Can anyone help me with checking the inventory to make sure the items required are there, etc.

Soruce: EasyRSC

Any help is much appreciated.

Thank you in advance ^^</description>

              <p>Thanks for a fast reply, xEnt.</p>
<p>Let me try clearly explain, sorry for bad English.</p>
<p>The npc handed out items without even taking items from the player, therefore I wanted it to check the players inventory to actually see if they possess the item he needs for the exchange over.</p>
<p>^Hope that makes more sense. I will try your code when I have more time to do so.</p>
<p>Thanks ^^[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 17, 2009, 05:15:23 am[/size][hr]Sorry for a late feedback, xEnt. I have only just managed to change it and check if it works.</p>
<p>It works fantastically, however 1 problem does arise.</p>
<p>Once the exchange of items has been successful, my character just stands there, unable to move, teleport, etc.</p>
<p>Not sure why he’s doing that. If you may know a solution to this problem/be able to point me in the right direction, you’re help is always greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Take care, Yong-Min</p>
