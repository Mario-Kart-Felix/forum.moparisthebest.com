    <title>Looking to start your own private server? Just manage ours!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-start-your-own-private-server-just-manage-ours/358150</link>
    <description>Hello,


We are a growing active community for discussion of gaming and technology. We are currently opening up a nice server and have it pretty well coded and expect to launch the beta fairly soon.

We have funds, a community, and a great host + paid server to put this on. What we need currently is someone to help us manage it.

We basically need someone to advertise for us, offer forum support(in the future) and etc.

You would be in an administrative position on the server as well as a few other possible perks around the block soon-to-come.

If you are interested, please drop me a PM or email me @ brandongar@gmail.com(also my MSN) for more information or to apply.


Please do not send me a &quot;hai can i has admin on ur server ch33b&quot; type of response as they will not even be considered.


Just need a semi-experienced individual in the runescape scene who is motivated and looking to help.


Thank you,

Brandon</description>
