    <title>Making A Item Require Pkp To Wear. 317 [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-item-require-pkp-to-wear-317-pi/441169</link>
    <description>Does anyone know how to make an item require pkp to wear it?
like if you try to wear Vesta you will need 50 pkp to wear it. No buy it but wear it.
so they can have 50k sets of vesta in their bank and wont be able to wear it unless they have 50 pkp.</description>

              <p>Well, I’m not exactly sure how to do this on a PI source, but however it would probably be better if you created a whole nother point system if you plan to do this, unless, of course you don’t plan to sell things with PKP.</p>
