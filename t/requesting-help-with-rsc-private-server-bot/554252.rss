    <title>Requesting help with RSC Private server BOT</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requesting-help-with-rsc-private-server-bot/554252</link>
    <description>Hey, i have been into java programming for 4+ years but i have never played runescape or programmed for it

a friend of mine in real life plays a private server called RSCE and has asked for my help to make him a bot so that it can automatically fish for him and automatically fight monsters so he can train etc

he has sent me the ClientLoader.JAR that this server uses to get the client up, but after looking for roughly 2 hours i cannot find the source code anywhere so i can make these modifications for him?

can someone plz help me on how to get started with this? 

i dont require that much help because i will know what to do once i am started but i cant figure this problem out? 

any help is much appreciated</description>

              <p>Well first off the client loader does just that it loads the client into a jframe i believe too lazy to look.  well it then downloads rscemulation.jar and loads the mudclient class into the frame and boom the client is there i believe he obfuscates the client with alatori. Anyways i dunno if you are injection reflecting or trying to deobfuscate but i will go ahead and say it may be above your programming knowldge. Goodluck</p>
