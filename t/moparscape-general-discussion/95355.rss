    <description>The intent of this post is to create a discussion of which aspects are missing in our very community. As you can see, our community is being degraded everyday, and, even if we think we are growing everyday, there are still aspects in every little thing that is still need to be discussed. But I, will leave this question for you to think, even knowing that I am acknowledged of the issues of this community.


-[i][b]What you don&#39;t most like in Moparscape community? How do you think that would be a good way to fix it?[/b][/i]


Remembering that this question englobes every session of the forums : Servers, Tutorials, the Users, Downloads Section, Rep Points, Moparscape CMs. It&#39;s a general discussion, any question is valid. You will be heard and considered for what you say and do, not for anything else.
Please if you come up with a problem, come up with a solution also. I don&#39;t want to see people complaining and cussing at each other, and any sign of flaming or conflict may result in a warning, mute, or even bannishment from Moparscape&#39;s Forums.</description>
