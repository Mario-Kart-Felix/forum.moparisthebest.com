<p>I really, do not care about your overrated presidential election. It’s screwed up and it’s sad. You think change is coming - I see youtube vids of Americans dancing around the streets in joy yet you’re all fed bullshit - AND you all believe it.

<p>Now, seriously any more threads and I might actually be forced to move to America and run for president.</p>
<p>If anyone replied to this topic discussing the election I will kill them.<br>

        <p>Did I ever say the world should be America? I love my country as you probably do yours, does it have problems sure enough a lot of them in no way am I saying the world is America. However you would care if the world economy fails because you most likely would be thrown into poverty or very close to it, And it would not care if your Anti-American or Anti anything it will effect everyone in some way or another. Even if your Anti-American America has done so many good things to the world that outweigh the bad the 60’s and 2000-2008 were the worst times politically in American history it seems nothing good comes out of America because of the bush administration but there are things that you don’t even know and without America your life would be very different no matter where you live. And the fact that this is the most important election in American history (Possibly) and a VERY historic time is why you here so much. America is the only country that every 4 years very peacefully the President is switched and the country gets another try. The world celebrated in ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY it was televised from Africa, to China from South Korea to Great Britain people celebrated mentally this election was exhausting on everyone. You know a good portion of the people on here are “Anti-American” but do not know the facts of how much there country most likely depends on America. You just need to really have your facts in order and stop being “prejudice” against Americans don’t agree with the government? Fine, you don’t have to agree with the government to be a good American to sum up our people you should be referring to the Bush administration if your talking about the past 8 years. Just to say this not all (Most) Americans are war-monger bush supporting idiot.</p>
<p>Take that into consideration, In no way am I saying we have the best country ever because we simply do not but we have a lot of things that no body else is able to have.</p>

        <p>Urgh, improve your fucking English. Paragraphing works wonders.</p>
<p>I stopped reading your full posts after the first line of your initial reply which said “with all do respect”. I think you mean “due” there but hey, what do I know? I’m just an overeducated Brit.</p>
<p>You’re arguing about things your little brain can’t yet comprehend, no-one here is an economist and no-one can prove with factual evidence that a particular country truly is a world superpower. Most of the worlds products are made in China, India and other such low cost labour countries. The United States has things available to it other countries don’t - just as others have stuff available to them the US doesn’t. That wasn’t the point of this thread, I said stop talking about the American election…</p>
<p>One thing is clear, it could only take an American patriot such as yourself to take a thread about stopping threads about the election (I apologise for that mouthful) and turning it into  a debate about why he thinks America is the greatest country in the world.</p>
<p>You have no place here, now kindly fuck off.</p>

 I am challenging your ignorant self which you have not yet even challenged any of my facts I have stated but you said you didn't read so I guess you just do not have a high reading level. I am tired of you always thinking American's are so bad its really getting old. But you know it just proves your immaturity I have not said 1 thing bad about the British or any other country that is negative, but it seems you always have something to say when it comes to America.

By base I am meaning it has a very large impact on the world economy if American economy starts falling the world economy will start to hurt and eventually fall.[/quote]As I am sure you know, the USA is not a primary industry based country.  Atleast, not anymore.  The country now runs on the secondrary and tertiary industries.</p>
<p>As I’m sure you also know, this means the USA has to import materials from the primary industries, IE, Canada and Mexico (hence the need for the NAFTA).</p>
<p>If the USA’s economy failed, they would be unable to purchase materials from the primary industries, and Canada and Mexico, which would put Canada and Mexico into a recession for the first while, however they would recover after finding new partners elsewhere as other nations would be unable to purchase products from the USA.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, the only way to make money is to export more than you import, if the USA economy fails, it will only affect Canada and Mexico, and only until they find new partners.</p>
<p>You are a tiny nation who simply thinks you are better than anyone else.  You have never won a modern day war, and your actions in WW2 were minimal.</p>
<p>You failed at invading Canada, you failed at holding back the brits.</p>
<p>You failed at invading Iraq for oil.</p>
<p>And you, sir, are an ignorant fuck who needs to learn his place.</p>

<p>Yes, And it is. Show me how it is not if you do not think so you need to learn what you are talking about. By base I am meaning it has a very large impact on the world economy if American economy starts falling the world economy will start to hurt and eventually fall.<br>
[/quote]As I am sure you know, the USA is not a primary industry based country.  Atleast, not anymore.  The country now runs on the secondrary and tertiary industries.</p>
<p>As I’m sure you also know, this means the USA has to import materials from the primary industries, IE, Canada and Mexico (hence the need for the NAFTA).</p>
<p>If the USA’s economy failed, they would be unable to purchase materials from the primary industries, and Canada and Mexico, which would put Canada and Mexico into a recession for the first while, however they would recover after finding new partners elsewhere as other nations would be unable to purchase products from the USA.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, the only way to make money is to export more than you import, if the USA economy fails, it will only affect Canada and Mexico, and only until they find new partners.</p>
<p>You are a tiny nation who simply thinks you are better than anyone else.  You have never won a modern day war, and your actions in WW2 were minimal.</p>
<p>You failed at invading Canada, you failed at holding back the brits.</p>

<p>Did I ever say the world should be America? I love my country as you probably do yours, does it have problems sure enough a lot of them in no way am I saying the world is America. However you would care if the world economy fails because you most likely would be thrown into poverty or very close to it, And it would not care if your Anti-American or Anti anything it will effect everyone in some way or another. Even if your Anti-American America has done so many good things to the world that outweigh the bad the 60’s and 2000-2008 were the worst times politically in American history it seems nothing good comes out of America because of the bush administration but there are things that you don’t even know and without America your life would be very different no matter where you live. And the fact that this is the most important election in American history (Possibly) and a VERY historic time is why you here so much. America is the only country that every 4 years very peacefully the President is switched and the country gets another try. The world celebrated in ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY it was televised from Africa, to China from South Korea to Great Britain people celebrated mentally this election was exhausting on everyone. You know a good portion of the people on here are “Anti-American” but do not know the facts of how much there country most likely depends on America. You just need to really have your facts in order and stop being “prejudice” against Americans don’t agree with the government? Fine, you don’t have to agree with the government to be a good American to sum up our people you should be referring to the Bush administration if your talking about the past 8 years. Just to say this not all (Most) Americans are war-monger bush supporting idiot.</p>
<p>Take that into consideration, In no way am I saying we have the best country ever because we simply do not but we have a lot of things that no body else is able to have.</p>
