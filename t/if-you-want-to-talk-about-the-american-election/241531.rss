    <title>If you want to talk about the American election</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-you-want-to-talk-about-the-american-election/241531</link>
    <description>Open up a notepad, or alternative text file.

Write down all your ramblings in there, print it off, take a shit on it. Eat it and then finally go fuck a nun.

I really, do not care about your overrated presidential election. It&#39;s screwed up and it&#39;s sad. You think change is coming - I see youtube vids of Americans dancing around the streets in joy yet you&#39;re all fed bullshit - AND you all believe it. Your education is biased, your entire life is based around false information fed through politicians who fill you with propaganda and patriotism.

Now, seriously any more threads and I might actually be forced to move to America and run for president.

If anyone replied to this topic discussing the election I will kill them.
If anyone replies disagreeing with me (for whatever reason; freedom of speech etc) - I will kill them.

You can reply with your agreements though, that is OK.</description>

<p>That doesn’t matter, it’s still a war crime. So if Milosevic, Karadzic and others warned the muslims, it wouldn’t be genocide?</p>

              <p>I have no reason to continue this, you ignored my last post but just to clear up your misinformed history:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Americans allied with France who then pulled in Spain. Before this we had the upper hand.</li>
<li>The “revolution” as you call it was actually just a treaty that replaced British government with local government.</li>
<li>We still had colonies over there which we later gave up. (Not surrender - there was no war involved)</li>
<li>We surrendered but so did you on multiple occasions, if you read up on the war the British army had the upper hand most of the time and if you take into consideration the war wasn’t popular at home (in the UK) and we had to ship troops over the Atlantic ocean I’d say we did a hell of a lot fucking better than you did.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway I broke my own rule of not debating this with you, luckily this is my first and last post on the matter because all either us did was read about it in a History book. I don’t even have to mention the fact that American textbooks are biased for patriotic reasons.</p>
