    <description>need help with tut server chapter three this bit

CHAPTER 3: 


Ok in this chapter we will be explaining different variables, frames, cases, and interfaces inside the different java files. I will also explain what they are used for. By knowing this you will become a much better coder. First off we will tackle the different variables.

Ok there are several commonly-used variables:


Code:
boolean
void
int

There are about 20 other ones in java besides these that are used, but these are the main ones used in RS2 private servers and probably the only ones you will be editing (for now.) Ok the boolean variable is usually used for large actions that include smaller variables inside them (voids and ints.) So here is an example of a boolean:


Code:
	public boolean process() 
	{		// is being called regularily every 500ms
		NewObjects();
		writePlayers();
This boolean is being used as a public boolean (which means it can be accessed by all other java files; you can also make it a private or just keep it boolean to make only that java file use it) and smaller-used variables inside it are &quot;NewObjects();&quot; and &quot;writePlayers();&quot;. Ok so now you understand booleans.
Lets move onto voids. Here is an example of a public void:


Code:
	public void Shinykey()
	{
		sendMessage(&quot;Your key shines up the room as the chest opens.&quot;);
		deleteItem(85,getItemSlot(85),1);
		addItem(1607,1);
		addItem(Item2.randomshinykey(), 1);
	}
Ok the void name is &quot;Shinykey()&quot; and it is invlolving code to send a message to the player, to delete the item (in this case the shinykey) and to add an item to the players inventory. But anyways, now this can be used for an action like in this sequence:


Code:
					//shiny key
				else if(useItemID == 85 &amp;&amp; (atObjectID == 172))//crystal chest
				{
					Shinykey();
				}  
This is saying that if the item (85) is being used at the object (172) then it will use the public void &quot;Shinykey()&quot;. Make sense? Good.
Ok now moving to int (intigers.) Ok this is a good exaomple of an int:


Code:
	public static int shinykey[] = {1046,4566,5698,1623,4566,4566,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623};//chest of keys - shiny key
    
	public static int randomshinykey()
	{
		return shinykey[(int)(Math.random()*shinykey.length)];
	}
Ok this is giving a public static int (the static is allowing it to be used in a public void [look above at my shinykey void]) the matrix of all those item IDs. Now the next public static int makes a random of that matrix to be picked when being used in a void. In this sequence - &quot;shinykey()&quot;.

*****

Let&#39;s move onto Frames now. Here are a few examples of Frames, sendQuests, and sendMessages being used:


Code:
sendQuest(&quot;@gre@Welcome to Freescape&quot;, 8145);
Code:
sendMessage(&quot;Oh dear you are dead!&quot;);
Code:
sendFrame126(&quot;TzHaar&quot;, 2484); 
Ok the first one &quot;showQuest&quot; is tell to show &quot;Welcome to Freescape&quot; on an interface (in this case the interface is inside the void MainHelpMenu.) The &quot;8145&quot; is the programmed frame of where the &quot;showQuest&quot; will show up in the Interface. Now the &quot;sendMessage&quot; is easy. When you die (in this sequence), then it will send a message in the chat box saying &quot;Oh dear you are dead!&quot;. This is simple enough. Now we will move onto the frame one. &quot;sendFrame126&quot; is saying that in that case (case 75 in this sequence) is sending frame126 to the amulet of glory saying in a frame &quot;TzHaar&quot;. This is as simple as it can get, sorry. I hope you understand the different purposes of this section of chapter 3.

*****

Now the tough one - cases! First off, cases are used to set certain actions to specific items/interfaces/frames. here is an example of a case being used:


Code:
			case 24: //KEY CRAFTING MADE 100% BY MOD TAHAROK
				sendFrame164(4882);
				stillgfx(199, absX, absY);
				sendFrame126(&quot;Congratulations, you just advanced a Key Crafting level!&quot;, 4884);
				sendFrame126(&quot;Congratulations, your Key Crafting is now &quot;+playerLevel[24]+&quot; .&quot;, 4885);
				sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations, you just advanced a Key Crafting level!&quot;);
				NpcDialogueSend = true;
				break;
Now this is saying that &quot;case 24&quot; is setting my skill (lol.) This is setting &quot;sendFrame126&quot; &#39;s to send a frame with those messages when I level up a new level. Also it will send a message to me (&quot;sendMessage&quot;.) This also allows &quot;NpcDialogue&quot; &#39;s to be used with this case. Besides that you can tell this case designates keycrafting a skill.

*****

Ok now we will move onto Interfaces. Interfaces are skins used to cover everything up that we usually use. Like menu backrounds (just the backround) are interfaces. Then the sidebar backround is the exact same Interface on each different tab. Here is an example of an Interface:


Code:
clearQuestInterface();
Code:
showInterface(8134);
Ok now this is saying to clear all quest interfaces (type of interface.) But it also says to &quot;showInterface(8134)&quot;. Interface 8134 is the backround on menus. This is putting in the menu-backround-Interface after the &quot;sendQuest&quot; &#39;s that I put into a void (MainHelpMenu). This is fairly easy to understand. I hope you enjoyed chapter 3 - I certainly did!

<p>CHAPTER 3:</p>
<p>Ok in this chapter we will be explaining different variables, frames, cases, and interfaces inside the different java files. I will also explain what they are used for. By knowing this you will become a much better coder. First off we will tackle the different variables.</p>
<p>Ok there are several commonly-used variables:</p>

Ok the boolean variable is usually used for large actions that include smaller variables inside them (voids and ints.) So here is an example of a boolean:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public boolean process()<br>
{		// is being called regularily every 500ms<br>
NewObjects();<br>
writePlayers();<br>
This boolean is being used as a public boolean (which means it can be accessed by all other java files; you can also make it a private or just keep it boolean to make only that java file use it) and smaller-used variables inside it are “NewObjects();” and “writePlayers();”. Ok so now you understand booleans.<br>
Lets move onto voids. Here is an example of a public void:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public void Shinykey()<br>
{<br>
sendMessage(“Your key shines up the room as the chest opens.”);<br>
deleteItem(85,getItemSlot(85),1);<br>
addItem(1607,1);<br>
addItem(Item2.randomshinykey(), 1);<br>
}<br>
Ok the void name is “Shinykey()” and it is invlolving code to send a message to the player, to delete the item (in this case the shinykey) and to add an item to the players inventory. But anyways, now this can be used for an action like in this sequence:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
//shiny key<br>
else if(useItemID == 85 &amp;&amp; (atObjectID == 172))//crystal chest<br>
{<br>
Shinykey();<br>
}<br>
This is saying that if the item (85) is being used at the object (172) then it will use the public void “Shinykey()”. Make sense? Good.<br>
Ok now moving to int (intigers.) Ok this is a good exaomple of an int:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public static int shinykey[] = {1046,4566,5698,1623,4566,4566,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,5698,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623,1623};//chest of keys - shiny key</p>
<pre><code>public static int randomshinykey()
{
	return shinykey[(int)(Math.random()*shinykey.length)];
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ok this is giving a public static int (the static is allowing it to be used in a public void [look above at my shinykey void]) the matrix of all those item IDs. Now the next public static int makes a random of that matrix to be picked when being used in a void. In this sequence - “shinykey()”.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s move onto Frames now. Here are a few examples of Frames, sendQuests, and sendMessages being used:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
sendQuest("<span class="mention">@gre</span>@Welcome to Freescape", 8145);<br>
Code:<br>
sendMessage(“Oh dear you are dead!”);<br>
Code:<br>
sendFrame126(“TzHaar”, 2484);<br>
Ok the first one “showQuest” is tell to show “Welcome to Freescape” on an interface (in this case the interface is inside the void MainHelpMenu.) The “8145” is the programmed frame of where the “showQuest” will show up in the Interface. Now the “sendMessage” is easy. When you die (in this sequence), then it will send a message in the chat box saying “Oh dear you are dead!”. This is simple enough. Now we will move onto the frame one. “sendFrame126” is saying that in that case (case 75 in this sequence) is sending frame126 to the amulet of glory saying in a frame “TzHaar”. This is as simple as it can get, sorry. I hope you understand the different purposes of this section of chapter 3.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now the tough one - cases! First off, cases are used to set certain actions to specific items/interfaces/frames. here is an example of a case being used:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
case 24: //KEY CRAFTING MADE 100% BY MOD TAHAROK<br>
sendFrame164(4882);<br>
stillgfx(199, absX, absY);<br>
sendFrame126(“Congratulations, you just advanced a Key Crafting level!”, 4884);<br>
sendFrame126(“Congratulations, your Key Crafting is now “+playerLevel[24]+” .”, 4885);<br>
sendMessage(“Congratulations, you just advanced a Key Crafting level!”);<br>
NpcDialogueSend = true;<br>
break;<br>
Now this is saying that “case 24” is setting my skill (lol.) This is setting “sendFrame126” 's to send a frame with those messages when I level up a new level. Also it will send a message to me (“sendMessage”.) This also allows “NpcDialogue” 's to be used with this case. Besides that you can tell this case designates keycrafting a skill.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ok now we will move onto Interfaces. Interfaces are skins used to cover everything up that we usually use. Like menu backrounds (just the backround) are interfaces. Then the sidebar backround is the exact same Interface on each different tab. Here is an example of an Interface:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
clearQuestInterface();<br>

showInterface(8134);<br>
Ok now this is saying to clear all quest interfaces (type of interface.) But it also says to “showInterface(8134)”. Interface 8134 is the backround on menus. This is putting in the menu-backround-Interface after the “sendQuest” 's that I put into a void (MainHelpMenu). This is fairly easy to understand. I hope you enjoyed chapter 3 - I certainly did!</p>
