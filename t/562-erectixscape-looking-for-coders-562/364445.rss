    <description>[size=18pt]Hello community of Moparscape![/size]

Currently our server is moving from a 317 to a 562

We need coders that are familiar with 562 servers, and are able to do the following:

Making shops, Making Global Objects, Creating commands, adding customs, and changing exp rates

Those are the main needs that we are looking for in a coder.

The source is decent for a 562; All minigames work, as well as Clan wars, bounty hunter, castle wars, and soul wars. All skills work including hunter, summoning, and slayer tasks. Attacking speed is runescape like. All skill cape emotes work. Some of the special emotes such as air guitar and Around the world in eggty days, and freeze work. All god sword emotes work, D claws spec works.
