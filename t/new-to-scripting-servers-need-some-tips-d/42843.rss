    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-to-scripting-servers-need-some-tips-d/42843</link>
    <description>So heres the deal:

I&#39;ve recentely become more and more interested in creating my own server, and from what i hear its not too bad. I know my way around a computer, but am new to scripting. I would really really really appreciate just some tips or even a guide on how to get started. I pick things up quickly, i just need some help getting into the right direction such as {needed downloads and other things.} Any help is apprecaited. Post here i guess or even email me at thexfaultxline@yahoo.com

Thanks.</description>
