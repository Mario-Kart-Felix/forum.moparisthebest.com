    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-to-scripting-servers-need-some-tips-d/42841</link>
    <description>So heres the deal:

I&#39;ve recentely become more and more interested in creating my own server, and from what i hear its not too bad. I know my way around a computer, but am new to scripting. I would really really really appreciate just some tips or even a guide on how to get started. I pick things up quickly, i just need some help getting into the right direction such as {needed downloads and other things.} Any help is apprecaited. Post here i guess or even email me at thexfaultxline@yahoo.com 

Thanks.</description>

              <p>Well if you need download, just go to the downloads section, and youll get a whole lot of choices, i recomend testscape, or cheezscape, but i enjoy project16 alot better, but project16 is for advanced coders, but its much better.<br>
