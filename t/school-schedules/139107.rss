I’m truly ignorant, because I had no idea he actually lived in Finland? OK, YOU ARE RIGHT! You are just another ignorant person that learned a fancy word for idiot.  That’s why my first post was “Hey, man! Where you from?” Not only because of that, and that I’m actually deeply interested in learning the language…it’s the second hardest language to learn! DID YA KNOW THAT ONE BUDDY?!</p>
<p>Heippa pillu<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The statement I quoted, which I clearly quoted for a reason, was dripping with pure retardation.  Your desire to learn Finnish has nothing to do with the apparent idiocy displayed in this statement: “Why would you take Finnish if you lived there?”</p>
<p>And no, I didn’t know that Finnish was the second hardest language to learn, nor do I care the least bit.  Not that I dislike Finnish people.  Rather, it is the simple fact that one cannot simply create a survey to determine the hardest language to learn or, by any quantitative means, rank languages by the difficulty in learning.  Another tidbit, provided by you, with a complete package of naivety.</p>
<p>Your final statement, heippa pillu, is a tribute to your hardcore-ness.  You are quite the badass, and the only way I could possibly respond to such a badass statement in Finnish would be to reply in the number one hardest language, which from a random poll I found online, happened to be Chinese.  But first, I had to translate that badass phrase into English.  So from what I see, it could either mean ‘Cheerio Pussy,’ ‘Cheers Pussy,’ ‘Cheerio Cunt,’ or ‘Cheers Cunt.’  Now I must clarify that I do not have a cheerio pussy or cunt; you must have mistaken me for some hooker you dated.  Or even your own mother.  But if I did have a pussy, it would be shaped like a normal pussy, more of a slit than a cheerio.  Now to reply to your badass statement.  With Google Translate, I typed in Cheerio Pussy, and it gave me 奶酪猫.  Which means ‘cheese cat.’  And really you can’t understand it anyway, so I don’t think it matters all that much.  So as of today, I, xxlegitxx, have proven myself the one true badass by calling you a 奶酪猫.</p>

<p>Yeah, but…I agreed with him saying I was ignorant, but I also contradicted that statement with another question after which made my first question rhetorical… by saying " yadadada it’s like english in america" I was under the impression he was from somewhere else…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So are you confessing that you’re schizophrenic or simply that you have a mental condition that prevents you from remembering the previous sentence that you typed?  Normal humans tend not to ‘contradict’ themselves in two sentences length, I’ll let you know.  Have no doubt, it’s quite a feat.  Furthermore, rhetorical questions are as useless and resource-wasting as your previous two posts.  Either make it a statement or leave it where it belongs.  Up your ass.</p>
<p>Oh, and stop posing as a girl.  Queerstick.</p>

<p>Lemme guess, grade 10? We had to do careers and civics as well. Easy stuff, terribly boring.</p>
<p>IIRC, my schedule that I got in the mail was:</p>
<p>Semester 1:<br>
-Spare (aka, sleep in an extra hour)<br>
-Law<br>
-English<br>
-Computer Science<br>
Semester 2:<br>
-Wood tech<br>
-Small engines repair<br>
-Math<br>
-Metal… tech?</p>
<p>But I won’t be attending school this year. Not even sure if my parents told my school that.</p>

              <p>[quote=“pixels, post:36, topic:139107”]I’m truly ignorant, because I had no idea he actually lived in Finland? OK, YOU ARE RIGHT! You are just another ignorant person that learned a fancy word for idiot.  That’s why my first post was “Hey, man! Where you from?” Not only because of that, and that I’m actually deeply interested in learning the language…it’s the second hardest language to learn! DID YA KNOW THAT ONE BUDDY?!</p>
<p>Heippa pillu[/quote]</p>
<p>The statement I quoted, which I clearly quoted for a reason, was dripping with pure retardation.  Your desire to learn Finnish has nothing to do with the apparent idiocy displayed in this statement: “Why would you take Finnish if you lived there?”</p>
<p>And no, I didn’t know that Finnish was the second hardest language to learn, nor do I care the least bit.  Not that I dislike Finnish people.  Rather, it is the simple fact that one cannot simply create a survey to determine the hardest language to learn or, by any quantitative means, rank languages by the difficulty in learning.  Another tidbit, provided by you, with a complete package of naivety.</p>
<p>Your final statement, heippa pillu, is a tribute to your hardcore-ness.  You are quite the badass, and the only way I could possibly respond to such a badass statement in Finnish would be to reply in the number one hardest language, which from a random poll I found online, happened to be Chinese.  But first, I had to translate that badass phrase into English.  So from what I see, it could either mean ‘Cheerio Pussy,’ ‘Cheers Pussy,’ ‘Cheerio Cunt,’ or ‘Cheers Cunt.’  Now I must clarify that I do not have a cheerio pussy or cunt; you must have mistaken me for some hooker you dated.  Or even your own mother.  But if I did have a pussy, it would be shaped like a normal pussy, more of a slit than a cheerio.  Now to reply to your badass statement.  With Google Translate, I typed in Cheerio Pussy, and it gave me 奶酪猫.  Which means ‘cheese cat.’  And really you can’t understand it anyway, so I don’t think it matters all that much.  So as of today, I, xxlegitxx, have proven myself the one true badass by calling you a 奶酪猫.</p>

<p>So are you confessing that you’re schizophrenic or simply that you have a mental condition that prevents you from remembering the previous sentence that you typed?  Normal humans tend not to ‘contradict’ themselves in two sentences length, I’ll let you know.  Have no doubt, it’s quite a feat.  Furthermore, rhetorical questions are as useless and resource-wasting as your previous two posts.  Either make it a statement or leave it where it belongs.  Up your ass.</p>
<p>Oh, and stop posing as a girl.  Queerstick.</p>
