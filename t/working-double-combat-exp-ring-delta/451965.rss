    <description>This is a tutorial on how to add a double experience ring to a deltascape source.
Files edited: client.java, class8.java
Difficulty - 1/10

To begin, open your client.java and find where you would change your experiencing rate, it will look something like this.

[code]
double TotalExp = 0;
          if (UseBow || UseCrossBow) {
            TotalExp = (double)(3500*hitDiff);
            TotalExp = (double)(TotalExp*CombatExpRate);
            addSkillXP((int)(TotalExp), 4);
          } else if (FightType != 3) {
            TotalExp = (double)(3500*hitDiff);
            TotalExp = (double)(TotalExp*CombatExpRate);
            addSkillXP((int)(TotalExp), SkillID);
          } else {
            TotalExp = (double)(3500*hitDiff);
            TotalExp = (double)(TotalExp*CombatExpRate);
            addSkillXP((int)(TotalExp), playerAttack);
            addSkillXP((int)(TotalExp), playerDefence);
            addSkillXP((int)(TotalExp), playerStrength);
          }
          TotalExp = (double)(1750*hitDiff);
          TotalExp = (double)(TotalExp*CombatExpRate);
          addSkillXP((int)(TotalExp), playerHitpoints);
          attackTimer = 0;
[/code]
 Okay lets break this down :
double TotalExp = 0;                                          This just declares TotalExp

TotalExp = (double)(3500*hitDiff);                        This says that your total experience is equal to 3500 times the amount of damage you do.

TotalExp = (double)(TotalExp*CombatExpRate);      This says you&#39;ll gain the amount of experience times the combat experience rate.

addSkillXP((int)(TotalExp), 4);                              This says it will add the experience that you gain to range.

after that it says the exact same thing except if you change your fight type (longrange, rapid) you could change the experience depending on your style.

the final thing this code says : 
TotalExp = (double)(1750*hitDiff);
          TotalExp = (double)(TotalExp*CombatExpRate);
          addSkillXP((int)(TotalExp), playerHitpoints);
          attackTimer = 0;
means pretty much the same thing as before except it&#39;s adding the experience to hitpoints instead and the attack timer gets reset to start your next hit.

Obviously your experience rates are a lot lower my max level is 150 though.

[color=green]Copy that text and paste it directly above where you copied it, leave three blank lines between them to help you though.
 
At the very top of that add this[/code]

[code]
if (playerEquipment[playerRing] == 4657) {
[/code]

[color=blue]What that does is say if you are wearing an item in your ring slot and the id is 4657 it will do the following.

Next in the middle of those three blank lines you left add

[code]
} else {
[/code]

and at the bottom add a single closing bracket.

You need these two things to say that if you are not wearing a ring with the id of 4657 it will give you your normal amount of experience and the closing bracket is saying its all done.

After that change the experience rates of one of them to double the other one.
There are 3 places where it tells you exp rates, do that in all 3 of them.

Now for class8:
Open your class8.java in your client folder and find 

[code]
if(i == 1077)  {
[/code]

What that is, is the beginning to your bandos tassets or chest idr because I changed the ID since then but it says if the id of your item is 1077 then do whatever comes after the bracket.

Above that add this
]
[code]
if(i == 4657) {
class8.aString170 = &quot;Double Xp ring&quot;;
class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;You gain double combat exp while wearing this ring &quot;.getBytes();
}
[/code]

What that does is rename the item 4657 to Double Xp ring and changed the items examine info to what it says below the line.

There you go you now have a ring that is called a double xp ring and doubles your experience.</description>
