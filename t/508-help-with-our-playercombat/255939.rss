    <description>Not revealing too much but were currently working on a simple but effective 508 pvp server, but currently when we try to fight this exception occurs in the run.cmd
&quot;this happens when one player attacks another&quot;

Exception in thread &quot;Thread-0&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException
at PvpXtreme.rs2.players.combat.PlayerCombat.attackPl ayer(PlayerCombat.java:52)
at PvpXtreme.rs2.players.Player.process(Player.java:1 510)
at PvpXtreme.rs2.Engine.run(Engine.java:168)
at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)

any help?
this crashes the client and causes the two fighters to loose connection.
if you don&#39;t know how to fix it, don&#39;t comment please.
if you are willing to help and know what your talking about, please post all helpfull information.</description>
