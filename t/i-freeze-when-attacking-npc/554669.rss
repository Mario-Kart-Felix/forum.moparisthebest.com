    <title>I Freeze When Attacking NPC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-freeze-when-attacking-npc/554669</link>
    <description>Hey guys. Every time anyone attacks an NPC on my server, the client freezes. What can I do to fix this?

<p>When I attack an NPC such as the skeleton in the edge wild, it doesnt freeze until the skeleton actually dies. But when i attack a man or frost dragon it freezes right as a hit it. Now that i have your comment in mind, ill play with it and see what i can figure out, thank you.</p>

<p>Disable death animations for NPCs, and then kill the skeleton.<br>
If it freezes again, it’s not the anims. If it doesn’t freeze, it’s the anims.</p>

<p>Tested magic on skeleton. I killed the skeleton without a problem. Tested magic on man and froze immediately. About to delete the death anims rn.<br>

It may not just be death animations<br>
Are you loading new data on your client?<br>
I.E: Running a 317 client but have 602 anims.<br>
If you are, the issue might be the anim ids got update or replaced, or they’re not being read in the client correctly.</p>
<p>Or, is your server setup for new data but you actually have older?<br>
I.E: Your server was connected to a client that had 602 anims, but then you changed the client to one with 474 anims.<br>
If this is the case, you are sending values to the client that doesn’t exist.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Sk8rdude461. You helped a lot, with the last comment. I know what I did. I appreciate the help!</p>
