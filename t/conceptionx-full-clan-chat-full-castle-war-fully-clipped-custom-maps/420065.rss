The concept of the game is pretty simple. ConceptionX is not like any other servers. It has some unique Features about it and we will do allot more then you see right now. We are planning on make custom quests with rewards and a story&#39;s lines. Custom maps are giving an graphic atmosphere about the feeling so its not any other rsps server. We are working on all time we can. We already did some good things. This an economic server. That means so there will be Pking,Skilling,Monster Killing,Quest and Minigames.

We have any limits in our team. There no Owner on the server. We have Moderators,Administrators and Developers. Each Member groupe has his own Permissions.

The concept of the game is pretty simple. ConceptionX is not like any other servers. It has some unique Features about it and we will do allot more then you see right now. We are planning on make custom quests with rewards and a story’s lines. Custom maps are giving an graphic atmosphere about the feeling so its not any other rsps server. We are working on all time we can. We already did some good things. This an economic server. That means so there will be Pking,Skilling,Monster Killing,Quest and Minigames.</p>

We have any limits in our team. There no Owner on the server. We have Moderators,Administrators and Developers. Each Member groupe has his own Permissions.</p>
