    <title>Wth is wrong!?!?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wth-is-wrong/218405</link>
    <description>Ok, so everytime I go to get on Moparscape or the Silab Client it laggs like hell... It doesn&#39;t matter what server it is or which client, it always laggs.. And when I say lagg I mean it really laggs bad, I click somewhere and 2 minutes later my character will move... I really don&#39;t understand why. I mean I have a Dell XPS 400, Broadband Internet Connection (256Kbs), like 30G of memory left, so I don&#39;t understand why it laggs... Somebody please tell me if these computer specs are good enough or tell me how I can check stuff like that... thanks</description>
