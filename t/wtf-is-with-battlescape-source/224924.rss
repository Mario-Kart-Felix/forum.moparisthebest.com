              <p>adog, I know battlescape is back up… there is NO point though seeing as T X is an admin now, T X loves to fuck with people. And I NEVER got my premium back… dont tell me I know nothing because I do, also mironic your calling me a “noob” because I wouldnt host your server because it gave me virus’ yeah… thats being a real noob.</p>

Pali is working on the 503 and may host the 317 server while we wait, you know nothing, also t x gave the database back, that means prems and stuff back,</p>
