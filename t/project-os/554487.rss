    <description>Hey everyone, I am going to open up a development team within the next few days. I am in a rush right now so this is just a simple post to get some basic information going out for those who are interested. This is a 317 Server that is oriented as an OSRS styled server. Nothing too crazy in features but keeping it clean and basic for players. I will add pictures and videos tomorrow to show what I have done so far. Now I would host myself, but am not able to do so. With that, I am also looking for a person who could host. I am easy to get along with and will do the Coding/Programming. I can also supply a VPS. For the Server Development Team I would be looking for 2 other Server Developers. 2Client Developers and 2 people for Forums. I know this post is sloppy, but as I stated numerous times this was done in a rush just to get basic information out, and I will improve this post tomorrow. If you are interested, PM me on Moparscape forums, and I will get back to all of you who are interested and make my picks, Thanks everyone for taking time to read this even if your not interested.</description>
