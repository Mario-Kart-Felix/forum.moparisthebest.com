Hi their again hope my last tutorial helped

In this tutorial i will be showing you how to use the findcolor function which is a big one in scar as scar mainly runs off finding colours.It is pretty basic so don&#39;t worry to much.

Ok so when we open scar were hit with this

program New;
begin
end.

So as in my last tutorial you know what all this stuff is.Now before we can use the function fincolor we need to declare variables.A variabl is something that stores information it can be either a integer,string and boolean by declaring them we can say what we want them to store

integer - number from 1-to infinity
string - letters or writing text eg&quot;h,l,a,hi.they,etc....)
boolean - either true or false 

now we have to declare the variables in a certain part of the script so it recognises it.We declare all variables after the &quot;Program New:&quot; part.In this tut we will be using and integer varaible eg

program New;
var // this is the thing that says we are declaring a variable
x,y :integer; // &quot;x,y&quot; are the variables and &quot;:integer;&quot; declares that it is an integer. 
begin
end.

ok so know that we have declared the variable we need to start writing our function.Now before we do the findcolor function i wan&#39;t to show you thw writeln function.

program New;
begin
writeln(&#39;hi traitors&#39;);
end.

this will show in that box at the bottom of scar what i wrote, i wrote &quot;hi traitors&quot;.copy and paste it and see if it works.Ok so now that we have done that we can start on the findcolor function.

program New;
var //declaring variables
x,y: integer; //type of variable we are declaring
begin
if(findcolor(x,y,4348647,531,170,531,169))then; // findcolor function
writeln(&#39;hi traitors i found the colour&#39;); //what it will do once it finds the colour
end. //end of script

ok so we have the variables declared here and we have our findcolor function written out correctly.Just so your not confused here the findcolor function by itself

if(findcolor(x,y,4348647,531,170,531,169))then;

ok so know lets break this function down.The &quot;x,y&quot; are the variables you declared earlier,

The &quot;4348647&quot; is the colour that you are trying to get scar to find and the 531,170,530,169 are the cordiantes at which the color is located at, note that their are four the first two that you get are from the color picker the other 2 you have to write becuase scar creates a little box in which it looks for that colour in that box, so basically just rewrite them with and up or down of 1 corordinate like i have done.

So if you wanted scar to find a different color to what i did then you have to change the colour number which you can get by using the colour picker and you would have to change the corordinates at which the colour was found.

then we have the &quot;then;&quot; bit at the end which basically means once scar has found the colour then it should execute(do this) function written on the next line(s).In our case it is going to write &quot;hi traitors found color&quot;

you could change this to clickmouse or movemouse or any other function making it very useful to scripters

well hope you learned how to use it post any questions 

thx

              <p>nice tut, helped me (a newbie script writer) but one question, I am completely crap at scripting atm, after you’ve got your last script in there</p>
<p>(program New;<br>
var //declaring variables<br>
x,y: integer; //type of variable we are declaring<br>
begin<br>
if(findcolor(x,y,4348647,531,170,531,169))then; // findcolor function<br>
writeln(‘hi traitors i found the colour’); //what it will do once it finds the colour<br>
end. //end of script)</p>
<p>how can u change it to make it only writeln if it finds that colour? coz on mine even in the scar window on a colour i set that was different it just went and said it anyway, and another question: how can you put in a clickmouse etc. after that which will click on that colour that it found in the findcolour function?</p>
