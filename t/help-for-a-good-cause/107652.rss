    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Trent’s aka “Surbo” stepbrother Robert M. Sacks recently had a devastating loss. Robert’s wife Lee Anne Archer Sacks died of breast cancer this past May of 2007. To honor the memory of his wife, Robert will be riding his bike 100 miles Portland, OR - September 29-30, 2007 in the Livestrong Challenge and try to raise at least $5000 for the Lance Armstrong Foundation which was founded in 1997 by cancer survivor and champion cyclist, Lance Armstrong, to inspire and empower people affected by cancer. livestrongchallenge.org. Robert is riding for her memory and the hope that the funds
that he helps raise for research might preclude others from having to
experience his deep loss.

Robert knows he can do this with the support and help of family, friends, and friends of friends…like you. Would you please consider making a donation? Follow this link to visit his personal web page and helps him in his efforts to support Lance Armstrong Foundation. You can donate online at:
