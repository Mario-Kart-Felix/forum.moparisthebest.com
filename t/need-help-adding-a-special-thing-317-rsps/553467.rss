<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(command.EqualsIgnoreCase("specialzone"){ //command used
triggerTele(absX, absY, Hieght); //Teleports player to your desired X, Y, and Z values
if (misc.random(3) == 0) { //all misc.random start at 0

there's references all in your server on how to take an npc id and change it to its name, or you can just type the npc name in for  each code*/
} else if (misc.random(3) == 1){
					server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;, ****, ^^^^, $); //spawns npc in game
					sM("&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; spawns!");
} else if...
ect...</code></pre>
<p>Legend:<br>
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; = NPC ID<br>
**** = X value you want the NPC to spawn at<br>
^^^^ = Y value the NPC spawns at<br>
$ = hieght level of the NPC<br>
Note: This was written for a Delta base all conversions are in your hands.<br>
Now if you wanted to you can even use a “Special Zone” teleport in your quest tab/spellbook but you gotta convert it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>EDIT: You should also add the boolean isInSpecialArea, that way if one persons there already someone can’t teleport in, oorr to where only 1 npc can spawn at a time. I only gave you a small portion of the code you’re going to need to finish this area, I hope you build on it, it’s a pretty good idea. Personally I’d use it as a bossing minigame, maybe have like a 10-20 killcount on some npcs then teleports you on a team and at the end of the waiting timer it spawns everyone into a chamber with 1 of 4 possible bosses. You could use that if you’d like, but take the smaller steps first  :P[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you , nice idea do you mind to add me on skype for some questions<br>
