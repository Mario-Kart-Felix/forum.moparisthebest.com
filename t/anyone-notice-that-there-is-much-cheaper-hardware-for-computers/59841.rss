Anyone notice that there is much cheaper hardware for Computers?

I read about a conspiracy in the NY times about 4 months ago (I think 4 months ago), and it was talking about how many computer hardware companies were conspiring with each other to inflate the price of items like USBs.

If you ever went to a computer store about 6 months ago, you would know that USBs were around $80 and up. Now days, they are about $20! Huge change!

I bought a 2 GB one at Comp USA for $20 and was pretty happy cause I need to transfer files often from my computer to the old one because the old one has a printer. And to do that, I was constantly uploading my files from my new computer to some server and downloading them on the old computer which was a 5 minute hassle. :rolleyes: 

Just wanted to let anyone know about this because I forgot about it. I wish I bought some of these earlier but after the lawsuit and exposure.

<p>It affected all products that buy 3d party memory. Such as the iPod. The iPod prices also decreased because of that scandal. Anything that stores memory or DRAM went down in price when the scandal was exposed and all the big memory manufacturers had to pay huge fines. I don’t know about Blue ray burners though.</p>

<blockquote>Turns out that over the course of several years the company, along with several other memory chip suppliers, had conspired to fix the prices and gouge PC manufacturers like Dell, HP, Apple, IBM, and Gateway.</blockquote>
So even computers became cheaper because of this scandal.

              <p>yeah i was going to say the two factors are:<br>
they will only sell the hardware to people… and wont sell again, its not like groceries you have to go buy them every week or so, with this hardware you buy a dvd burner and dont buy another… untill you want to upgrade to say blue ray, therefore the company lowers its price, and as they do that (to draw in more people) so do all the other companys to compete.</p>
<p>The second is that our technology now is moving at a rapid pace, 1 terabite seemed a great hard drive (to me) about a year ago, but already now they say theyve almost got a 37.5Tb hard drive. So ofcourse 1tb hard drives are going to go down in price.</p>
<p>In other news, i purchased a 4Gb usb memory stick about 5 months ago, it was £48 when i bought it, its now £38 and before all of that about a year ago 4gb usb memory sticks were about £100+</p>

<p>Can you even burn blu ray movies on Windows Vista computers? Because if you can’t, then that would explain why the price has fallen. (This is basically Microsoft DRM related).</p>

              <p>It’s simple really, supply and demand. When the supply is relatively low and the demand is high they raise the prices to either make up for the production costs or too make more money. When the supply goes up then the production costs are less, or when supply is up and demand is low then they need to lower the price in order to sell.</p>

I’m obviously lying. I made up the whole thing just to post a topic. :rolleyes: I’m obviously being sarcastic…</p>
<p>The fact is that there was price gauging and they were caught by the New York DA. It made the news for about 2 or 3 days. Maybe it wasn’t on TV. I just read the papers. And as much as you enjoy to argue facts, you’re wrong. Damn, if only I had the article. Oh well, you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.</p>
<p>Edit: I found a piece of it.<br>
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/biztech/02/07/samsung.chip.suit.ap/index.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/biztech/02/07/samsung.chip.suit.ap/index.html</a></p>
<p>Samsung settled their lawsuit by paying $90 million dollars. I tried looking for the main article which came out in 2006 with every memory stick/flash card manufacturer that all got together to fix the prices.</p>

That’s basically it.</p>
<p>Just think of it like Runescape’s items. Something new comes out, everyone wants them. (Whip was like 10m+), soon, they become old and more people have them, price lowers.</p>

<p>Anyone notice that there is much cheaper hardware for Computers?</p>
<p>I read about a conspiracy in the NY times about 4 months ago (I think 4 months ago), and it was talking about how many computer hardware companies were conspiring with each other to inflate the price of items like USBs.</p>
<p>If you ever went to a computer store about 6 months ago, you would know that USBs were around $80 and up. Now days, they are about $20! Huge change!</p>
<p>I bought a 2 GB one at Comp USA for $20 and was pretty happy cause I need to transfer files often from my computer to the old one because the old one has a printer. And to do that, I was constantly uploading my files from my new computer to some server and downloading them on the old computer which was a 5 minute hassle. :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Just wanted to let anyone know about this because I forgot about it. I wish I bought some of these earlier but after the lawsuit and exposure.</p>
