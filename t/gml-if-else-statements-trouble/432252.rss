    }
[/code]


Don&#39;t need all the crap about GML being crap because god do I know it, have to do it for college work.


Basic idea:
Game is a 2d top down nazi zombie survival wave based thing (exactly like WaW zombies - gameplay wise), this chunk of code is for picking up a weapon, the top part states that if the player is within a certain distance from the rifle object, they can right click to carry out the series of IF statements I have there.


The weapons are all stored in arrays like:


[code]

weap[0,0]=&quot;Unarmed&quot;;
weap[0,1]=0; //max ammo
weap[0,2]=0; //current ammo
weap[0,3]=0; //clip max ammo
weap[0,4]=0; //ammo
weap[0,5]=0; //bullet damage
weap[0,6]=0; //rate, time between shots, increase for longer delay
weap[0,7]=&quot;spr_unarmed&quot;; //sprite


weap[1,0]=&quot;Pistol&quot;;
weap[1,1]=72; //max ammo
weap[1,2]=72; //current ammo
weap[1,3]=8; //clip max ammo
weap[1,4]=8; //ammo
weap[1,5]=5; //bullet damage
weap[1,6]=7; //rate, time between shots, increase for longer delay
weap[1,7]=&quot;spr_pistol&quot;; //sprite


weap[2,0]=&quot;Rifle&quot;;
weap[2,1]=54; //max ammo
weap[2,2]=54; //current ammo
weap[2,3]=6; //clip max ammo
weap[2,4]=6; //ammo
weap[2,5]=15; //bullet damage
weap[2,6]=25; //rate, time between shots, increase for longer delay
weap[2,7]=&quot;spr_rifle&quot;; //sprite


active[0]=1; //primary weapon
active[1]=0; //secondary weapon, null at beginning of game[/code]


Now the problem is, when I start the game, all I get is a spam of &quot;You have insufficient score to purchase this weapon, 600 score is needed.&quot; messages, before I even click the weapon or anything, which is one of the last lines of code, because the score starts at 0.  It seems to be just skipping the top part of the code.


Any advice?  It&#39;s probably due to where the else statements are placed, that&#39;s my hunch anyway.
And should I be using a switch for this kind of thing?</description>

<p>Sorry for the horrible conventions, it’s difficult with the code tag and I don’t want to have to go through it spacing each thing properly.</p>
<p>You had a few issues with the if-else conditions. The issue was the fact you were asking it to say insufficient score when you had no “obj_player” (as I said in a previous post). When you didn’t have 600 points, you were asking for the player to say if they really wanted to pick up the gun. You also were using an if statement in an else statement that could have been an else if statement. Let me know if it still doesn’t work.  :D[/quote]<br>
Thank you so much, works flawlessly, sorry that you had to spoonfeed me, but it was just that the if and else statements were placed wrongly wasn’t it?  I see it now as you’ve indented very nicely, will definitely do that in future work.  Also I didn’t know you could use “else if(”") {" like that, similar to java, I thought you could only use “else { if (”") {", I think that’s where some of the confusion was :o , thanks again <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Don’t know if you understand why the message keeps appearing, so I’ll say it. It keeps displaying “You have insufficient score to purchase this weapon, 600 score is needed.” because instance_exists(obj_player) is false.<br>
So, you can do what Rix_ said about making 2 game states, or you can create the player on start up.</p>

I assume that would fix the messages appearing on start up, though surely when the game state is initialised and set to true then the messages would begin appearing again?</p>

<p>Don’t need all the crap about GML being crap because god do I know it, have to do it for college work.</p>
<p>Basic idea:<br>
Game is a 2d top down nazi zombie survival wave based thing (exactly like WaW zombies - gameplay wise), this chunk of code is for picking up a weapon, the top part states that if the player is within a certain distance from the rifle object, they can right click to carry out the series of IF statements I have there.</p>
<p>The weapons are all stored in arrays like:</p>
<p>[code]</p>
<p>weap[0,0]=“Unarmed”;<br>
weap[0,1]=0; //max ammo<br>
weap[0,2]=0; //current ammo<br>
weap[0,3]=0; //clip max ammo<br>
weap[0,4]=0; //ammo<br>
weap[0,5]=0; //bullet damage<br>
weap[0,6]=0; //rate, time between shots, increase for longer delay<br>
weap[0,7]=“spr_unarmed”; //sprite</p>
<p>weap[1,0]=“Pistol”;<br>
weap[1,1]=72; //max ammo<br>
weap[1,2]=72; //current ammo<br>
weap[1,3]=8; //clip max ammo<br>
weap[1,4]=8; //ammo<br>
weap[1,5]=5; //bullet damage<br>
weap[1,6]=7; //rate, time between shots, increase for longer delay<br>
weap[1,7]=“spr_pistol”; //sprite</p>
<p>weap[2,0]=“Rifle”;<br>
weap[2,1]=54; //max ammo<br>
weap[2,2]=54; //current ammo<br>
weap[2,3]=6; //clip max ammo<br>
weap[2,4]=6; //ammo<br>
weap[2,5]=15; //bullet damage<br>
weap[2,6]=25; //rate, time between shots, increase for longer delay<br>
weap[2,7]=“spr_rifle”; //sprite</p>
<p>active[0]=1; //primary weapon<br>
active[1]=0; //secondary weapon, null at beginning of game[/code]</p>
<p>Now the problem is, when I start the game, all I get is a spam of “You have insufficient score to purchase this weapon, 600 score is needed.” messages, before I even click the weapon or anything, which is one of the last lines of code, because the score starts at 0.  It seems to be just skipping the top part of the code.</p>
<p>Any advice?  It’s probably due to where the else statements are placed, that’s my hunch anyway.<br>
And should I be using a switch for this kind of thing?</p>
