The next (partly) aliment will be in 2675 and will still be nothing like a real alignment. So we’re safe from dangerous alignments for a long time to go. Download <a href="http://www.shatters.net/celestia/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Celestia</a> and check for your self.</p>

<p>Yeah they just updated the system central to every electronic device on the planet that was going to be vulnerable to the millennium bug.</p>
<p>Your comment sparked a question of interest, do people now (and I’m talking about people born after or just before the year 2000) think that everything is networked together o_O because anyone who lived in the '90s remembers this shit surely.</p>

<blockquote>There is no planet alignment in 2012 or any other time in the next several decades. As to the Earth being in the center of the Milky Way, I don’t know what this phrase means. If you are referring to the Milky Way Galaxy, we are rather far toward the edge of this spiral galaxy, some 30,000 light years from the center. We circle the galactic center in a period of 225-250 million years, always keeping approximately the same distance. Concerning a pole shift, I also don’t know what this means. If it means some sudden change in the position of the pole (that is, the rotation axis of the Earth), then that is impossible, as noted in the answer to Question 10. What many websites do discuss is the alignment of the Earth and Sun with the center of the Milky Way in the constellation of Sagittarius. This happens every December, with no bad consequences, and there is no reason to expect 2012 to be different from any other year.</blockquote>

<p>As stated in that Q&amp;A, from a reliable source (instead of some idiotic conspiracy nut), there is no alignment. So get your head out of your arse and do some research before you believe some random idiot with no credentials other then from other random idiots.</p>
