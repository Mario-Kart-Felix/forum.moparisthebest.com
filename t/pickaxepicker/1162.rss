    <title>PickaxePicker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pickaxepicker/1162</link>
    <description>ok i modded the cabbage picker a bit so that instead of getting cabbages it will go from the fally east bank to where the entrance to the mining guild is. then it goes to the left and there is a room with a crate in it an on top of the crate there is a bronze pickaxe. it respawns evrey minute or so...whatever the regular respawn time is on stuff i guess. but im having a prob. once it opens door I (see pic) it walks infront of the crate which its supposed to do. now instead of grabbing the pickaxe it trys to open door II. there is another door at the top right but i stopped the script before it tried to go for it. any ideas on how i can make it grab the pickaxe once it gets infront of the crate instead of going for the other doors? i attached my script so anyone can take a look. post it back here if you get it working :)

              <p>bah scrap this i dont even need it anymore. im going to start working on something else i can use. thanks for all the help and all. i dont know why this wont work now. it compiles fine. wehn its walking to the door it click the tile in front of th door then before it gets there it clicks the tile on the outside of the wall beside the crate, which makes it start to walk all the way around to it. but after a few secs it clicks the tile in front of the door again. so i put it in the room right in front of the crate and it just sat there and didnt get any pickaxes. my last attempt is attached</p>

              <p>I’m pretty sure even though its on the crate, its still a GroundItem.  You should look for the pickaxe as an item and use takeItem instead of finding it as an object and useing atobject.</p>
<p>Do you have to search the crate, or do you just pick up the item off the top of the crate?</p>

              <p>i ued the id of the item because if i use the id of the crate it will probably try to search the crate al the time. the pickaxe only respawns like once every 30 or 45 secs. i guess if i find out ow long i can make it wait that long then run the method again… thanks ill try that out</p>
