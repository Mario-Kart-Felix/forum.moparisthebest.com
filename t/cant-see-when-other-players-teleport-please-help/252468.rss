    <title>Can&#39;t See When Other Players Teleport, Please Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-see-when-other-players-teleport-please-help/252468</link>
    <description>Lets say two players go to ::teampk. They both walk north 6 steps into the wildy. They begin to fight each other. One of the players puts in ::teampk again and teleports backwards 6 steps. Now to the other player, it appears he is still in the wildy, meaning it doesn&#39;t update the position of the player on the other player&#39;s screen. So it appears to the other player that this player is still in the wildy but he isn&#39;t. The only way to fix is kicking him but I don&#39;t like doing that every time. How can I fix this problem?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 23, 2008, 11:27:25 pm[/size][hr]Yeah lets totally view it and not help and just help everyone else...</description>
