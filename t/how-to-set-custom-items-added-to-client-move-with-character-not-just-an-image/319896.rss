    <description>ok i added 100s of customs to my server! the weps work fine because i added ids in client.java (server side) with animation. what i need to do is set animation.... i think? eg. the armor because boots, helm, pl8, legs are all still. eg when i move my legs boots stay together while my legs are moving and same with boots. how do i fix this?</description>

              <p>Ok I don’t get what your saying so these are your options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If customs are equiped in the weapon slot add them to item.java under the correct spot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If items have no animation add the animation using DatMaker. If this is your problem then wrong section mate. Check SilentCJ’s TUT in the Modelling help section.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 16, 2009, 02:56:09 am[/size][hr][quote=“b15, post:3, topic:319896”]if u want to see go to (Hidden for advertising Purposes)[/quote]</p>

              <p>no it goes in the right place. ur talking about putting the id into item4 and in right section. ( i have done that). what i need to do know is, make is so when i move my leg up the armor goes with my leg. if i were to move my leg in game the platelegs would stay facing down. if u want to see go to <a href="http://www.b15servebeer.webs.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.b15servebeer.webs.com</a></p>
