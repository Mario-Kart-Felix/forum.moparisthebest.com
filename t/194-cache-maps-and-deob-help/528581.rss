    <title>194 cache, maps and deob HELP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/194-cache-maps-and-deob-help/528581</link>
    <description>What&#39;s up, a noob here. For a while now, I&#39;ve been searching everywhere trying to find out how to get a 194 server to work. The problem a lot of people were having is that the 194 maps were missing, however, a short while back they were actually released by Scu11 himself. Right now, I have a 194 client and cache working together, all I need now is to find out how to get the maps working and what server to use to connect to it with. I have uploaded pictures of the cache, maps and deob and have also uploaded all the files. I really want to get this to work for nostalgic reasons, so it&#39;s highly appreciated. Thanks!
