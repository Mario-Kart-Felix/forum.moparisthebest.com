<p>Thor isn’t quite what I expected it to be, but then I only understand half of it, need to do some reading up and have a longer fuck around with it before I can pass judgement too much. The stuff they added to the sequencer is useful, but my personal wow at the moment is the arpeggiator - the most boring part of the new release is seriously the most fun shit ever. I love love love how you can just randomly chuck in arps on the fly while recording/jamming just by holding multiple notes down, and then stop it when you want and carry on jamming, all without touching the mouse or computer keyboard.</p>
