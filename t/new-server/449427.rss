    <title>New Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-server/449427</link>
    <description>Please read the whole topic.

My name is Austin Skaggs. I&#39;m 15 and have wanted to start a server for quite a while. I&#39;m not looking for my own server exactly but to be on a dev team with someone. I am an amateur coder and can only do very basic things. If you put me on the project I would only like to be an admin or Co-Owner. If you are wondering about staff experience i have plenty. I can be a loyal staff member and I am always willing to help in any way that I can. I will advertise as well as stay true to the server. I will try and find glitches and get to know the players to try and make it as fun for them as possible. Please reply asap I want to get started and help make the greatest server ever.</description>
