RuneVeteran is a constantly growing server that strives for perfection in the developement stage! Once you&#39;re with RuneVeteran you won&#39;t ever want to log out![/CENTER]


RuneVeteran provides multiple difficult bosses, and perfect content. For example, we have Godwars which is fully complete. We have got fully Nex and loads of other bosses such as Queen black dragon and King Black Dragon. We also have working Barrows , Flasks working , Pets fully working Torva/Virtus/Pernix Working Hp health. We got overloads and all the chaotics. Fully Summonning is added. Primal plus all the other dungeoneering items. RuneVeteran is the best private server to help you enjoy the features of RuneScape, but faster! 737 cache so upgraded armour u can change back to the old features if you like so. Working Squeel of Fortune. We&#39;ve recently added aura&#39;s aswell. So are Dice bag and Flower game.
