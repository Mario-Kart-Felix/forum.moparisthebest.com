    <title>Man receives 30-pound brick of weed in the mail</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/man-receives-30-pound-brick-of-weed-in-the-mail/258154</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;DENTON, Texas – A man in Denton, Texas who was expecting a shipment of tools instead received a 30-pound brick of marijuana that police say is worth more than $10,000. Officer Ryan Grelle says the man opened the box Monday night, realized it contained drugs and contacted police.

The package from the Pharr area was handled by UPS in McAllen on Jan. 6. and apparently was intended for a Dallas address.

The Denton Record-Chronicle reports no such address exists in Dallas, so the package wound up 40 miles to the northwest at the similar address in Denton.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If 30 pounds of marijuana is only worth $10,000 then I don’t want to smoke that stuff. Probably similar to the dirt the blacks and the Mexicans smoke near here.</p>
<p>But If I were to get 30 pounds of it, I would just break it down and sell it by the QP and make a lot more than $10,000 from it.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>lol quarter pound…I would chop it by the dime. Make way more money than you :D[/quote]<br>
Have fun selling it, ha! QP is a lot better way to get rid of shit weed. Or maybe if I have the time drop weight by the oz.</p>

<p>Stfu, being gay and being a smoker is irrelevant with eachother.</p>

              <blockquote>DENTON, Texas – A man in Denton, Texas who was expecting a shipment of tools instead received a 30-pound brick of marijuana that police say is worth more than $10,000. Officer Ryan Grelle says the man opened the box Monday night, realized it contained drugs and contacted police.
<p>The package from the Pharr area was handled by UPS in McAllen on Jan. 6. and apparently was intended for a Dallas address.</p>
<p>The Denton Record-Chronicle reports no such address exists in Dallas, so the package wound up 40 miles to the northwest at the similar address in Denton.</p>
