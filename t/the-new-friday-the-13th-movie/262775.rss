    <title>The new Friday the 13th Movie</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-new-friday-the-13th-movie/262775</link>
    <description>Travis and I went to see this movie on...when else....Friday the 13th. And we thought it sucked!!

The movie had a lot of boobs and drugs in it...so I&#39;m sure all of the guys are going to run out and watch it now. But it didn&#39;t follow the original Friday&#39;s at all!!!! Ugh.

Has anyone else seen it? Did you like it at all?</description>

I planned to go see this movie but then I figured it was going to be just another dumb remake of a good older movie so I saw Taken instead.</p>
<p>Are they going to remake all the Friday the 13th’s?<br>

<p>I really hope not. It was so bad. Jason was like running after people, and instead of just using the knife to kill them he was getting creative and doing all of this other stuff. I just didn’t like it since I liked the others one so much. I mean, it still had us jumping in our seats, but I would not see it again.[/quote]<br>
They should have just kept the classic style of Jason walking around hacking up people with his machete. Maybe I’ll rent it when it comes out on DVD though.</p>
