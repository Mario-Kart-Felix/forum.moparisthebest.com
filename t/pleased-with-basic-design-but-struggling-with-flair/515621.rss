    <title>Pleased with basic design but struggling with flair</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pleased-with-basic-design-but-struggling-with-flair/515621</link>
    <description>Hi :) I&#39;ve created a basic site and I&#39;m very pleased with how it&#39;s coming along so far, but I&#39;m struggling to get a good colour scheme going [b]at all[/b]. I&#39;ve tried to go for grey with bright accents but it just isn&#39;t working, so I&#39;d appreciate any help with colours but any constructive criticism of the overall site would also be appreciated :)

The site can be seen at www.jamesmonger.com

Parts I&#39;ve attempted colour in can be seen in URLs, when hovering over URLs and when selecting text.

Thanks in advance.</description>
