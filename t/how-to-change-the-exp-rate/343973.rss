    <title>How to change the exp rate?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-change-the-exp-rate/343973</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, finally got my client working, and noticed the exp rate was really high.
I&#39;m using the Project Purple client with the TestScape source. I&#39;ve been through all the tutorials, but I can&#39;t seem to find any of the items that they tell me to look for. Where do I need to go in this particular client to change the exp rate?
Thanks in advance.</description>
