    <title>Tomato router firmware</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tomato-router-firmware/295848</link>
    <description>I guess this belongs in linux because its based off linux.

I upgraded from stock linksys firmware to tomato firmware, boosted the x-mit power, and found an empty channel.  The problem is, the wireless quality is worse than it was when I had the linksys firmware (poor signal, less than 24mbps connection).  With the linksys firmware, I usually had a good/excellent signal with a 48mbps - 54mbps connection.  This same thing happened to me with dd-wrt.

Anyone know how to fix this?</description>

              <p>I have DD-WRT v23 SP1 Final micro installed on my router and I love it. Its so much better than that old shitty linksys firmware (I had to reboot the router to make ANY changes with that shit &gt;.&lt;).  The only problem I have run into with it is that if I overclock the cpu above a certain level, the router reboots itself between midnight and 1 am… Not really a problem, just a nuisance if i’m doing something…</p>

Retire an older machine into a router (just put gigabit network cards in) and boot from m0n0wall cd. Obviously, place the cable from your modem/old router into eth0 (to make it simple), and a cable going out (eth1) to a switch. Then from the switch buy an access point and use the remaining ports on the switch to rout the wired machines. If you are using the old router -&gt; new router, set up the new router as a DMZ on the old (obviously).<br>

<p>That doesn’t do anything to address his wireless signal problems though.</p>
<p>What did you boost the xmit to?  Try not boosting it at all, I always run dd-wrt and find it much better than the stock linksys or netgear firmware.[/quote]<br>
He could move it closer if it were a weak signal. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
