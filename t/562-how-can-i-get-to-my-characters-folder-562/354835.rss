    <title>[562] How can i get to my characters folder? [562]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-how-can-i-get-to-my-characters-folder-562/354835</link>
    <description>I am new to all 508+ and i would like to know how i can get to my characters folder. i know this is sorta spoonfeeding but i am basically a clueless bastard. Also if possible, does anyone have a great tutorial or a link to a tutorial that basically tells all information or basic information on how to use a 508+ like a 562? like how to make yourself owner, how to add autospawn area&#39;s for npcs, how to add an object to an area like an altar, how to make an area multi-combat, and such.
Thanks for anyone that helps!
