    <title>XP rate?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xp-rate/217140</link>
    <description>Well i have a crappy source called testscape, one of the problems is that i think that the XP rate is too big, when you start at lvl 3, you can already kill the KBD because of all the level ups, one hit and you level up, so you hit 1 agains KBD, and your HP goes up a level, and you have full health again. this wa its not fun i think.

Does anyone have a solution so i can change the rate of xp growth? please help!</description>
