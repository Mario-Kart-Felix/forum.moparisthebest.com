              <p>I don’t understand what you just said so i’m going to make a random stab at the question.</p>
<p>If you use a router the internet connection is shared between all your PC’s but also the ip. The reason why you can’t see your own ip from the config pannel is that what you are seeing is the local ip. when the data goes to the internet. it gets the ip changed.</p>
<p>To change your ip and you are on dialup - simply disconnect and reconnect again.<br>
Broadband - unplug the modem for an hour then plug it back in again - this usally works bu i have had the same ip for a month or so but this may be because my dedicated firewall (another computer) is allready running.<br>
If you have a static broadband account - well your screwed - you can’t change your ip. It costs extra for this service so it’s unlikely you have it unless you are hosting a webserver - in which case you wouldn’t come here.</p>
<p>If all else fails - use a socks5 proxy. Don’t ask here - there is a tut on this site about how to do it. Use the fing search button.</p>
