    <description>Hello there, after following many jarring process I&#39;ve ran into the solution that I&#39;m jarring/signing correctly. 

However each time I start my client.jar i get this

[SIZE=5][B][U][FONT=Arial Black]1) I know that it can&#39;t find the file &quot;main_file_cache.dat&quot; [/FONT][/U][/B][/SIZE]

However, I do know that the Main_file_cache.dat is located in my &quot;CACHE&quot; folder within the client.

I&#39;ve zipped the FILE in the CACHE folder not the CACHE FOLDER itself the &quot;files in the cache folder&quot; .zip...
Upload it to dropbox, added [dl.] infront of my url.

but still it doesnt work....





Here is my signlink.java

Here is my CacheDownloader.java

Here is my client.java

[url=http://pastebin.com/eGrjZJnc]http://pastebin.com/eGrjZJnc[/url]


Question is what do i do?
Is there an antileech somewhere that I do not know?

Edit#1

Before all of this, when I jar it would say &quot;Could not find or load main class client&quot;
So i put SIGNLINK.java/Class into folder SIGN, then I took out all of my .class and .java into the open folder like this

and it finally open but led to not being able to connect.</description>
