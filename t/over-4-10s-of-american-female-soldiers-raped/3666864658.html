<p>I never said it was OK to chop people’s heads off. I only ever expressed how the American military behaves worse than those it calls terrorists and then goes on to proudly spew rubbish on television about how bad these ‘terrorists’ are.</p>
<p>Oh and thank you, I’m sure I have the FBI up my ass now.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the actual figures aren’t that out of proportion for knife crime.</p>
<p>Besides. Allowing people to carry guns and knives is giving those “bullies” easy access to means that will allow them to progress to that next level, of mugging and robbery.</p>

<p>EDIT: (ignore for the minute the post I just edited out) on the subject of knife crime,</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">It continues into the adult world, regrettably, where bullying turns into robbery and muggings, and fists turn into concealed knives.</span></p>
<p>It isn’t just muggers who carry knifes, from what I understand a lot of the knife crime is caused because people carry knives for self-defence, where they either get stabbed by their own knife or end up going to prison because they tried to defend themselves, and like it or not if guns were the solution there wouldn’t be any muggings or personal attacks to speak of where guns were legal(and mitb has proven it is reduced I know, but it still persists).</p>
<p>and on the subject of “Britain is a prime example of a country with rampant knife crime,”, read:</p>

<p>I mean I live in a pretty shitty area and the corner store I worked in was robbed 5 times in the past 5 months, no knives to speak of, and of the recent murders in this county I haven’t seen any where the weapon was a knife.</p>

<p>The Gun is a primitive solution to a problem that has been ignored (the cause of violent criminal behaviour in countries such as the USA, where it apparently is very common). The only way to progress is to find real solutions, not solutions that has a possibility of being counterproductive.</p>

        <p>I know Mopar has described it as the great equaliser, but certainly never God-given. After all, ‘God made men and women, Samuel Colt made them equal’. It was actually Samuel Colt’s gift to mankind. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>On a serious note though, I’m pretty sure it has only ever been described as that. Not some harbinger of peace, but merely something with which to defend one’s self.</p>
<p>Anyway, obviously humanity is more primitive than you’d like to believe. As a race, I’m sure we’ll move forward in our own time.</p>

        <p>It seems there are three staple topics on this forum: american wars within the middle east, guns, and ps3 vs 360 :P.<br>
I too agree that perhaps the numbers are skewed and the perhaps sample isn’t representative of the population of my original post, but felt it was worth sharing nonetheless.</p>

<p>Anyway, obviously humanity is more primitive than you’d like to believe. As a race, I’m sure we’ll move forward in our own time.</p>

<p>I disagree with this statement… humanity can have behavior that appears primitive, but that doesn’t mean it is. Waiting for change isn’t going to bring change, action has to occur. Like Speljohan said, the cause has to be determined and then solutions created… not counterproductive ones.<br>
Another example: In America, a lot of youths who commit crimes are sent to psychiatric hospitals. At some institutions they will attempt to force diagnoses upon the patients (fallaciously questioning, for example, making all questions related to a certain mental illness to try and skew the patients input without giving them time to explain) and then give them medication, a lot of which is still being testing. These medications often don’t help, but the patients who want to get out/get high off of the medication will lie and say they do work, and then the findings are reported back to drug companies. Within these institutions often times “therapy” is simply a joke made to appear to be helpful without actually helping at all. A lot of times when people are discharged, they end up doing the same things they did before entering, or worse, and sometimes end up back in the hospital or even prison. If the government or an NGO were to actually attempt to help these so-called ‘troubled youths’ without using them as lab rats, I bet a percentage of U.S. crime, suicide, and abuse rates would dissipate.<br>
