    <title>Over 4/10s of American female soldiers raped</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/over-4-10s-of-american-female-soldiers-raped/366686</link>
    <description>http://blogs.alternet.org/penucquem/2010/10/26/covered-up-more-than-13-of-american-woman-soldiers-raped/
&lt;blockquote&gt;A congresswoman said Thursday that her “jaw dropped” when military doctors told her that four in 10 women at a veterans hospital reported being sexually assaulted while in the military.

A government report indicates that the numbers could be even higher.
Rep. Jane Harman, D-California, spoke before a House panel investigating the way the military handles reports of sexual assault.

“My jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military,” said Harman, who has long sought better protection of women in the military.

“We have an epidemic here,” she said. “Women serving in the U.S. military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in Iraq.” As of July 24, 100 women had died in Iraq, according to the Pentagon.

In 2007, Harman said, only 181 out of 2,212 reports of military sexual assaults, or 8 percent, were referred to courts martial. By comparison, she said, 40 percent of those arrested in the civilian world on such charges are prosecuted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Holy shit. This is terrible.

I too agree that perhaps the numbers are skewed and the perhaps sample isn’t representative of the population of my original post, but felt it was worth sharing nonetheless.</p>

<p>I disagree with this statement… humanity can have behavior that appears primitive, but that doesn’t mean it is. Waiting for change isn’t going to bring change, action has to occur. Like Speljohan said, the cause has to be determined and then solutions created… not counterproductive ones.<br>
Another example: In America, a lot of youths who commit crimes are sent to psychiatric hospitals. At some institutions they will attempt to force diagnoses upon the patients (fallaciously questioning, for example, making all questions related to a certain mental illness to try and skew the patients input without giving them time to explain) and then give them medication, a lot of which is still being testing. These medications often don’t help, but the patients who want to get out/get high off of the medication will lie and say they do work, and then the findings are reported back to drug companies. Within these institutions often times “therapy” is simply a joke made to appear to be helpful without actually helping at all. A lot of times when people are discharged, they end up doing the same things they did before entering, or worse, and sometimes end up back in the hospital or even prison. If the government or an NGO were to actually attempt to help these so-called ‘troubled youths’ without using them as lab rats, I bet a percentage of U.S. crime, suicide, and abuse rates would dissipate.<br>
(Pardon the lack of proper grammar and incoherency, I had a long night.)</p>

<p>On a serious note though, I’m pretty sure it has only ever been described as that. Not some harbinger of peace, but merely something with which to defend one’s self.</p>

<p>The Gun is a primitive solution to a problem that has been ignored (the cause of violent criminal behaviour in countries such as the USA, where it apparently is very common). The only way to progress is to find real solutions, not solutions that has a possibility of being counterproductive.</p>

<p>EDIT: (ignore for the minute the post I just edited out) on the subject of knife crime,</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">It continues into the adult world, regrettably, where bullying turns into robbery and muggings, and fists turn into concealed knives.</span></p>
<p>It isn’t just muggers who carry knifes, from what I understand a lot of the knife crime is caused because people carry knives for self-defence, where they either get stabbed by their own knife or end up going to prison because they tried to defend themselves, and like it or not if guns were the solution there wouldn’t be any muggings or personal attacks to speak of where guns were legal(and mitb has proven it is reduced I know, but it still persists).</p>
<p>and on the subject of “Britain is a prime example of a country with rampant knife crime,”, read:</p>

<p>I mean I live in a pretty shitty area and the corner store I worked in was robbed 5 times in the past 5 months, no knives to speak of, and of the recent murders in this county I haven’t seen any where the weapon was a knife.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is a very good point, and most likely accurate. What passes for assault these days can be something as trivial as brushing up against someone as you walk past. Obviously the intent is what would make it sexual assault, but I could see someone having the finger pointed at them despite them having no intent to do such a thing.</p>
<p>Too many do-gooders in the world.</p>
