    <title>614 - Need Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/614-need-help/372314</link>
    <description>Okay, so I have a 614 client and server, but my server is missing an option to send an item on an interface (it&#39;s usually called &quot;itemOnInterface&quot; or something like that). How would I go about finding the ID number for the packet that must be sent to the client in order for this to happen?

On my 562, it had an ID of something around 56, but they always change with every cache revision.</description>
