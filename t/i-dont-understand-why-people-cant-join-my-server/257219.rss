    <title>I dont understand why people cant join my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-dont-understand-why-people-cant-join-my-server/257219</link>
    <description>Well,I just finished editing things around on DDSSPECED client,and it runs fine.My problem is that for some reason only people within my house can join (Using my direct computer IP).I have made port 43594 open on my firewall and my router.I have made a no-ip and made a host and that works fine.Port 43594 is only accesible when I have my server running,I&#39;m not sure if that is how it is supposed to be,but when I ping it off some website I found on the web my server picks it up,but doesnt know what to do with it.So I tryed connecting to myself on another computer in my house with the ip address everyone else would be using(my no-ip) and it didn&#39;t work(error connecting to server),I can&#39;t figure out why.Im using a netgear router,so I was just wondering if anyone could please please help

Thanks in advance =)

*edit*
I just used this to find if my port 43594 is open http://www.seemyport.com/ it said its OK!

The only thing I could think of is my no-ip is not working? or my router is doing something wrong...uhh</description>
