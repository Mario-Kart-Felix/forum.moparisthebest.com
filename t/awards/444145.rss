    <title>Awards</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/awards/444145</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t think awards are given as often as they should. We have a lot that are never even used or seen anymore.

• Start the SOTW award for winners; giving a boost to the Graphics section
• Return the &quot;Moparscape Vet&quot;
• LPOTM, Batman, and all the &quot;new&quot; awards should be given out way more.

How exactly can these start to be given out more?</description>

</aside>
<p>The Moparscape Vet is based on your community contributions, useful and informative posts and a vote ratio of 2:1+1 if you are suggested as far as I know. I also think 50 rep was a requirement however reputation is useless, so I doubt that matters.</p>

<p>There were exact reasons why it was hidden in the first place. It may take a while to try and bring it back, but that’s only if we can get the right support for it. You are for it and casey might be, but we need a lot more support before we’ll try to revisit those original problems.</p>
<p>People may be nominated by others or staff members for those awards, but they are essentially handled the same as the mitb awards. All of them have been given out except ‘Java Coder,’ which is currently under scrutiny and may be removed in the future.</p>

              <p>SOTW and LPOTM will be up to how the new graphics board is run. Neither, one, or both will be used in the future. That’s not something I can really discuss.</p>
<p>Batman has traditionally been a very exclusive award. Only the most significantly contributors of the website have earned it. I would think it’s a bit too prestigious to give out right now (I can’t even think of any non-staff members that would deserve it, except maybe a few ex-staff).</p>
<p>Could you elaborate on your other points?</p>
