    <title>Discussion: STOP BEING LAZY! STOP SPAMMING, IT DOES NOT HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/discussion-stop-being-lazy-stop-spamming-it-does-not-help/48732</link>
    <description>Yes, this topic is for discussion upon why people are being so lazy.

I want to stress the key points about this topic:


[ul][li]Why do people not look at the FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)?[/li]
[li]Why do people continuously post useless, already answered topics?[/li]
[li]Why do people expect others to help them upon arrival?[/li]
[li]Why is the search button rarely used?[/li]
[li]What is this section for?[/li][/ul]


These are the points I will now thoroughly discuss with you right now:

[i]Why do people not look at the FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)?[/i] Because, they are lazy and incosiderate. Many people here (such as Mrqaurter and Alexia) try to help you people with your problems, yet you continue to spam useless topics that are already answered. We post rules for you, but you do not follow them. We help you in topics, but you post even more topics. You people do not read Java manuels and expect us experienced people to &#39;help&#39; (in your context it means &#39;build for you&#39;) you with your server. Why do you abuse and take for granted the help you are receiving.

[center][size=20pt][b]IT IS ENOUGH!!![/b][/size][/center]

We will end tolerating all of your abusing immediatly! If you do not appreciate the help you are receiving, LEAVE!!! We do not want people here who are spoiled and rotten &#39;kids&#39; ausing these forums. IT IS ENOUGH!!!


[i]Why do people continuously post useless, already answered topics?[/i] Read above and you will find your answer for this one.


[i]Why do people expect others to help them upon arrival?[/i] Because they are selfish and too hopeless to use the FAQs or Search button for their convenience.


[i]Why is the search button rarely used?[/i] A lot of people are unaware that the search engine is a very powerful tool. All you need is some patience when skimming through the result pages, but surely your touble will be resolved! Here is the link for the search button (I advise you memorize it!):

http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=search


[i]What is this section for?[/i] This question personalizes specificly the RS2 Server Development/Help section, but it can be asked in any question on these Boards. That is why I will make an overview on them:

[b]Forum Purposes[/b]

[ul][li]RS2 Server Development/Help - [i]This section is for help upon RuneScape Private Servers (RSPSs.) Since there are premade FAQs that cover almost every question imaginable to newcomers when dealing with RSPS, this section is better for those questions that are asked by the people who actually develop their server and encounter issues. Now, this leads into the second purpose of this section. This section is also created for peopleto discuss Development (Dev) Projects with fellow members. This section would be one of my favorite sections if it was not overspammed with useless, already answered questions.[/i][/li]
[li]RS2 Server Downloads - [i]This section is for any downloads that have to do with Private Servers. People usually are selfish when it comes to their Private Server and do not distibute it with others. The better coders, who are more selfless and looking for some fame, do post their servers with others for the whole community (or those who care) to enjoy it. Many people copy the idea to create a Tutorial Program or Server Building Program, which is alright, as long as it does not get out of hand. This section is being spammed over by people complaining and flaming over miscellanious issues. This is the absoulute worst section of flaming. I never liked this section much, but I am still, and always will be, concerned over the ammount of flaming going into this section.[/i][/li]
[li]RS2 Server Advertisements[i]This section is by far the most spammed section in the history of RS Cheating. It makes these forums look like CRAP! You guys look like idiots when posting  &#39;can I be a mod?&#39; or &#39;up?&#39;. It looks terrible. This section is for Advertising your server with the community and not discussing wether it is online or offline or wether a certain individual can become a moderator/administrator. I have also seen many members discussing how their server is in development. I can say that anything to do with development belongs in the RS2 Server Development/Help section.[/i][/li]
[li]RS2 Server Tutorials[i]Many people personally know me from this section (because of being a past Sectional Moderator, and because of my server guide.) They should also know that I am well aware of what goes on in this section. This section is for tutorials tutoring other members of the community for the benefits, and future development of international (meaning multiple communities) RSPS. This section is full of false accusations and stealing. People should only post in here when discussing that individual&#39;s tutorial, and nothing else. [u][b]IF SOMEONE THINKS A TUTORIAL IS BEING STOLEN OR LEECHED, DO NOT IMPLY THAT IN THE ACTUAL TOPIC. INSTEAD, CONTACT A MODERATOR OR ADMINISRATOR SO THAT THEY CAN DEAL WITH IT.[/b][/u][/i][/li]
[li]RSC Server Development[i]This is the section that people rarely post in. It is a section for everything to do on Classical RS Servers. This section is going a little broad on the amount of spam in it, but is still not that bad. Follow the rules, and you will be alright.[/i][/li]
[li]MoparScape Questions[i]This section is for everything to do with the MoparScape client. If you cannot log onto a private server via this client, the question belongs in here. This section is the section that people repeatedly reply the exact same flames and spam (worse then RS2 Server Development/Help.)[/i][/li]
[li]Aryan Private Server Scripts[i]Many people do not know what Aryan even is. It used to be the Scripting Cheating System the RS Cheaters used to Auto on RuneScape before Jagex caught onto it and slaughtered it. Now people use (or can) to cheat on private servers. Look in here for more ways upon development and DO NOT SPAM IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.[/i][/li]
[li]RS Private Server Client Hacking[i]This has to do with anything upon RuneScape Client hacking. From downloading the clients and caches, to deobfuscating the obfuscated client for the application of a Bot. Any modifications to Bots that you have discovered/designed, belongs in here. Like the RSC Section, this section spans in any direction (from questions or tutorials to downloads), as long as it has to do with the RuneScape Private Server Client.[/i][/li][/ul]


Now, here are my nicknames for each section:


[ul][li]RS2 Server Development/Help - &quot;The Graveyard of all Topics&quot;[/li]
[li]RS2 Server Downloads - &quot;The Forge of Flaming&quot;[/li]
[li]RS2 Server Advertisements - &quot;The Land of Spam&quot;[/li]
[li]RS2 Server Tutorials - &quot;The Battlefield of Hurt&quot;[/li]
[li]RSC Server Development - &quot;Ooh, What is RuneScape Classic?&quot;[/li]
[li]MoparScape Questions - &quot;Consisted of Everything Else...&quot;[/li]
[li]Aryan Private Server Scripts - &quot;The Board of Misconseption and Confusion&quot;[/li]
[li]RS Private Server Client Hacking - &quot;What is a deob?&quot;[/li][/ul]


Some are corny (Forge of Flaming..), but that is not the point. Each of these have to do with their counterparts. Now, some may ask:



[size=36pt][b][i]WHY SHOULD I CARE?[/i][/b][/size]

You should care because it is what people do. If you do not stand together, you will fail. If you are obsoulete in the cause of good, what good can come from it? Why should you care? You need to understand both sides before assumption comes. You need to know what the real world is and what it has become before thinking selfishly and not about others. You need to overcome lazieness or end up a who-knows-what on the street corner somewhere because you are a spoild, rotten, lazy brat. You need to make sure others are treated exactly how you wish to be treated back. You need to stop impressing people and stand up for what is truly right. But, why should you care?</description>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">What is this section for?</span> This question personalizes specificly the RS2 Server Development/Help section, but it can be asked in any question on these Boards. That is why I will make an overview on them:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Forum Purposes</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]RS2 Server Development/Help - <span class="bbcode-i">This section is for help upon RuneScape Private Servers (RSPSs.) Since there are premade FAQs that cover almost every question imaginable to newcomers when dealing with RSPS, this section is better for those questions that are asked by the people who actually develop their server and encounter issues. Now, this leads into the second purpose of this section. This section is also created for peopleto discuss Development (Dev) Projects with fellow members. This section would be one of my favorite sections if it was not overspammed with useless, already answered questions.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]RS2 Server Downloads - <span class="bbcode-i">This section is for any downloads that have to do with Private Servers. People usually are selfish when it comes to their Private Server and do not distibute it with others. The better coders, who are more selfless and looking for some fame, do post their servers with others for the whole community (or those who care) to enjoy it. Many people copy the idea to create a Tutorial Program or Server Building Program, which is alright, as long as it does not get out of hand. This section is being spammed over by people complaining and flaming over miscellanious issues. This is the absoulute worst section of flaming. I never liked this section much, but I am still, and always will be, concerned over the ammount of flaming going into this section.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]RS2 Server Advertisements<span class="bbcode-i">This section is by far the most spammed section in the history of RS Cheating. It makes these forums look like CRAP! You guys look like idiots when posting  ‘can I be a mod?’ or ‘up?’. It looks terrible. This section is for Advertising your server with the community and not discussing wether it is online or offline or wether a certain individual can become a moderator/administrator. I have also seen many members discussing how their server is in development. I can say that anything to do with development belongs in the RS2 Server Development/Help section.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]RS2 Server Tutorials<span class="bbcode-i">Many people personally know me from this section (because of being a past Sectional Moderator, and because of my server guide.) They should also know that I am well aware of what goes on in this section. This section is for tutorials tutoring other members of the community for the benefits, and future development of international (meaning multiple communities) RSPS. This section is full of false accusations and stealing. People should only post in here when discussing that individual’s tutorial, and nothing else. <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">IF SOMEONE THINKS A TUTORIAL IS BEING STOLEN OR LEECHED, DO NOT IMPLY THAT IN THE ACTUAL TOPIC. INSTEAD, CONTACT A MODERATOR OR ADMINISRATOR SO THAT THEY CAN DEAL WITH IT.</span></span></span>[/li]<br>
[li]RSC Server Development<span class="bbcode-i">This is the section that people rarely post in. It is a section for everything to do on Classical RS Servers. This section is going a little broad on the amount of spam in it, but is still not that bad. Follow the rules, and you will be alright.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]MoparScape Questions<span class="bbcode-i">This section is for everything to do with the MoparScape client. If you cannot log onto a private server via this client, the question belongs in here. This section is the section that people repeatedly reply the exact same flames and spam (worse then RS2 Server Development/Help.)</span>[/li]<br>
[li]Aryan Private Server Scripts<span class="bbcode-i">Many people do not know what Aryan even is. It used to be the Scripting Cheating System the RS Cheaters used to Auto on RuneScape before Jagex caught onto it and slaughtered it. Now people use (or can) to cheat on private servers. Look in here for more ways upon development and DO NOT SPAM IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]RS Private Server Client Hacking<span class="bbcode-i">This has to do with anything upon RuneScape Client hacking. From downloading the clients and caches, to deobfuscating the obfuscated client for the application of a Bot. Any modifications to Bots that you have discovered/designed, belongs in here. Like the RSC Section, this section spans in any direction (from questions or tutorials to downloads), as long as it has to do with the RuneScape Private Server Client.</span>[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Now, here are my nicknames for each section:</p>
<p>[ul][li]RS2 Server Development/Help - “The Graveyard of all Topics”[/li]<br>
[li]RS2 Server Downloads - “The Forge of Flaming”[/li]<br>
[li]RS2 Server Advertisements - “The Land of Spam”[/li]<br>
[li]RS2 Server Tutorials - “The Battlefield of Hurt”[/li]<br>
[li]RSC Server Development - “Ooh, What is RuneScape Classic?”[/li]<br>
[li]MoparScape Questions - “Consisted of Everything Else…”[/li]<br>
[li]Aryan Private Server Scripts - “The Board of Misconseption and Confusion”[/li]<br>
[li]RS Private Server Client Hacking - “What is a deob?”[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Some are corny (Forge of Flaming…), but that is not the point. Each of these have to do with their counterparts. Now, some may ask:</p>
<p>[size=36pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">WHY SHOULD I CARE?</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>You should care because it is what people do. If you do not stand together, you will fail. If you are obsoulete in the cause of good, what good can come from it? Why should you care? You need to understand both sides before assumption comes. You need to know what the real world is and what it has become before thinking selfishly and not about others. You need to overcome lazieness or end up a who-knows-what on the street corner somewhere because you are a spoild, rotten, lazy brat. You need to make sure others are treated exactly how you wish to be treated back. You need to stop impressing people and stand up for what is truly right. But, why should you care?</p>
