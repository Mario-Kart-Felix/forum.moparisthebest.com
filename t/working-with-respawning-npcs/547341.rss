    <title>Working with Respawning (NPCs)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/working-with-respawning-npcs/547341</link>
    <description>Respawning works perfect on my server. Npc dies 30 seconds he respawns. My problem is the players can just log out and back in to respawn them it bypasses the respawn time all together. I have tried looking for this in login methods, can&#39;t seem to find it.</description>

<p>Reminds me of Enkrona… Maging dead npcs lol.<br>
His NPCHandler could also be adding them to the update list even if they are marked as dead. so it sends a “still dead” npc. If this is incorrectly in the correct order it would allow for them to respawn, be attacked, and have the dead flag written over. Being killable again.</p>

              <p>This sounds like it is a deeper rooted problem that your login method. NPC’s should have their own handler which controls which NPCs are doing what (including living!). If i had to guess, this MIGHT be an issue dealing with the death timer. When a player logs out, it could default to something allowing the npc to respawn. There is not much information to answer the question at hand, but from the looks of it you will have a good bit of work ahead of you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
