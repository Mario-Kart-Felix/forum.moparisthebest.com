    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-finding-what-to-forward/257103</link>
    <description>I&#39;m almost done portforwarding (I think), I just need to find out what I need to forward, it comes up with awhole bunch of things, I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m looking for though..
