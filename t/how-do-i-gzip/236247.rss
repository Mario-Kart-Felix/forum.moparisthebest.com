Edit:

My friend sent me a  gzip application but when i stick it in the folder with the file i wanna gzip the black box opens and closes really fast. I got lucky with a print screen shot and got the full msg it was saying which was:

&quot;gzip: compressed data not written to a terminal. Use -f to force compression. For help, type: gzip -h&quot;
