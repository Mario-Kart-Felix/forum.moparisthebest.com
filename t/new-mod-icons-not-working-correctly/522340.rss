    <title>[NEW] Mod Icons not working correctly</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-mod-icons-not-working-correctly/522340</link>
    <description>Okay this is by far the most irritating thing I&#39;ve had in a while.

The default server has 2 crowns, and 4 rights:
0 - Player
1 - Mod - Has silver crown
2 - Admin - Has gold crown
3 - Owner - Has gold crown - same as 2

This is what I want my server to have:
0 - Player
1 - Donor - Donor symbol
2 - Mod - silver crown
3 - Admin - gold crown
4 - Owner - gold crown (maybe a custom, doesn&#39;t matter right now)

Well, rights 0, 1, and 2 work.
but rights 3 is the same image as 2, and 4 works correctly as well.
#3 is the only broken one here.
In other words:
0 - Player
1 - Donor - Donor symbol
2 - Mod - silver crown
3 - Admin - silver crown
4 - Owner - gold crown

This is what client.java looks like (all are similar, I&#39;m not posting 300 lines of similar code):
[code=java]
								switch(playerRights) {
									case 1:
										modIcons[1].drawSprite(xPos, yPos - 12);
										xPos += 14;
									break;
									case 2:
										modIcons[2].drawSprite(xPos, yPos - 12);
										xPos += 14;
									break;
									case 3:
										modIcons[3].drawSprite(xPos, yPos - 12);
										xPos += 14;
									break;
									case 4:
										modIcons[3].drawSprite(xPos, yPos - 12);
										xPos += 14;
									break;
								}[/code]
and the mod icons:
Ignore 0, that&#39;s used elsewhere.
