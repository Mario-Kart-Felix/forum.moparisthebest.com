    <title>2010-2011 RS Highscores</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2010-2011-rs-highscores/518466</link>
    <description>this was made entirely by me (meaning, i downloaded everything individually, edited each webpage and added the php to include the different pages via $_get)

this php code is probably extremely horrible/vulnerable. i just wanted to do it in a single file, rather than multiple files like most highscores do.

this is not a finished project, and will not be finished by me. i don&#39;t have the patience or knowledge to do so.

the code is all bad, but i feel as though i did good for a learning experience (this has been on my hdd for a long time - i started making it before the pages were updated fully (when the homepage was first updated in 2011))

notice the url and you&#39;ll see how i did it (i probably should have done some sort of template system to include the requested page, but no. i used a million if statements)

please do not criticize the code, as i know it sucks. i just feel as thought someone may be able to fix/recreate it, or just find some use into the styling/images.
