    <title>What I worked on before I left</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-i-worked-on-before-i-left/68969</link>
    <description>I have been away for some time. I had alot of bad stuff last year. Avatarium dieing, runeStatus crumbling, rune-server turning bad. So I Left!


I made a server from scratch. Client.java is not the main file. The client.java was only 7kb. the class was 3kb.

However is had alot of lagg. I might work on it again. Thank god no client.java. It uses 1 void to load cfgs btw. 

I took the example of rscd for handling packets. It seemed good. However my source is currently not as powerful as these servers you have today.

Done:

-Logging in
-Walking
-Trading
-Attacking
-Dieing
-Banking
-Loging character files into a folder.


Outline of files:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Player:
Variable storage for a SINGLE player, instanced.

PlayerManager:
Updates ALL players.

NPC:
Variable storage for a SINGLE NPC, instanced.

NPCManager:
Updates ALL NPCS.

World:
Variable storage for the WHOLE world, includes Items, Objects.

WorldManager:
Updates all things like Object Locations, Items on the ground.

Client:
A SINGLE players connection to there Client and are Server.

ClientManager:
Updates all the information sent and recv from are Server and there Client.

PacketList:
Takes the packets we get from ClientManager and performs the actions for a SINGLE player, instanced, this also sets player flags and what not, this class should have EVERY PLAYER SPECIFIC class from here on, such as Banking, and Equipment.

Database:
Manages the PRE LOADING of are data into there classes on startup.

Server:
Listens for connections and deals with them in the correct manor, also creates the MASTER PROCESS.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Those are the main ones
OUTLINE: BAD


And no there are no shops or npcs [they are worked on]. You might say its crap. But hey, No one bothers to do anything except copy paste.
