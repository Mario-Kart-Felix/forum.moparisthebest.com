    <title>&lt;Hyperion&gt; Help with editing objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-help-with-editing-objects/463369</link>
    <description>Alright, so I need a little bit of help, the whole reasoning behind me wanting to do this is for doors, but the objects in game really aren&#39;t registered as entities or anything server-sided, so I can&#39;t directly add/delete/rotate any objects in-game, all the objects loaded from the cache are stored in a collection that corresponds with the region (I believe), so could I possibly change this to a HashMap possibly, so I can just grab an object with a key? Any help would be appreciated, thanks.</description>
