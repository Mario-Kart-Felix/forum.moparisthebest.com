Scroll down to PortForawrding//Porttriggering
In the first box fill in your server name
In Strart port put- 43594

Open your cmd by going to Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd.
Type in `ipconfig´
It will say your default gateway.
Open a web browser like internet explorer or Netscape. Enter the gateway in the address bar of your browser.
