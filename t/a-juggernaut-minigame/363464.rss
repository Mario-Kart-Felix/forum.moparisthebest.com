    <title>A juggernaut minigame?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-juggernaut-minigame/363464</link>
    <description>Hey,
I&#39;m new to coding for RSPS, and I have a concept I&#39;d like to put into my server, and could use some help with it. The idea is to make a minigame where players are rewarded for killing and/or getting kills as juggernaut.  The Juggernaut would recieve the &quot;Juggernaut weapon&quot; (+1000 all attack types, and +400 defense, +500 strength...bronze dagger...). It would take place inside inside mage bank arena, with queuing  area being inside the bank.  While I don&#39;t have any actual code yet, I&#39;ve been using contextual clues to learn some basic things.  My idea would be something like this:(not using 100% actual code, just plain english)
&lt;blockquote&gt;if (playerisinjuggernautwaiting == 1) {              //checks if player is in the waiting area
    if (juggernautcountdown == 600)                //every 10 mins new game starts
       {
           teletoinsidearena;                             //if the player is in the waiting area at to 10 minute waiting point, they are teleported inside of the juggernaut arena(mage arena)
          playerisinjuggernautwaiting = 0;           //sets it so that they are no longer in the waiting
          worthjuggernautpoints = 1;                 //makes it so if they are killed at this point they are worth points to the juggernaut to kill
       } else {
      if (world5mincounter == 300; {                //if they are in the waiting area, and the server tells them to wait and assures them it will start soon
        sM (&quot;Please wait, next game beginning shortly&quot;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*this is what I have planned so far that I know how to do.*
Ok now here&#39;s where I need help.
I want to be able to store a few scores of the players like how many times been Juggernaut, kills as Juggernaut, etc. in their character files, how do I make it update that in save file
If I put all this in it&#39;s own class file, how do I reference variables in other class files (like the 5minworldcounter I have in client.class)
How to update scores once you kill someone, die, or become Juggernaut.
Display something that shows who is currently juggernaut
A logic engine that decides randomly between all the people in queue who gets to be juggernaut.
There are a few more things I&#39;ll need help with as I plan ad code this all out.

Thanks to anyone who can help me, and sorry if this sounds like a lot, but I&#39;ve been looking online for a while and can&#39;t find anything on these subjects (or similar)</description>

<p>This is a base. You didn’t really specify how people won etc so I had to improvise. Currently the players get put in the game after 10 minutes, every ten minutes a new game starts whether or not old one was finished, only one game can be running at once. If two games run over no new juggernaut will be picked and the old one will be used.</p>
<p>There is no way to win except the juggernaut killing everyone.</p>
<p>Also if you want to use this you will have to work out how to implement it this is just the class and I am quite tired now so yeah <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
