<p>Okay look, i went with another server. Problem with this is im trying to find out how to make a autocache download so it goes straight into the C: drive so people don’t have to take the cache and place it there to play it. I need it to automatically go there, How can i do this?<br>

<p>Most clients already have a cache downloader implemented. You just need to change the download link, and the cache location in your signlink class[/quote]</p>
<p>okay ill show you mine and tell em what i need to change, i think i know what ur talking about but not fully understanding. this will be my signlink.java file. Also stupid enough the person who made the client or whatever decided to put 2 caches in the client folder first one has the second cache with all the files… so dumb</p>

Make sure your server is connecting to your IPv4 (I think?) and so is the client. Or connecting to your no-ip, if you use one.</p>
<p>Or, it could be a portforwarding issue, make sure you’ve portforwarded correctly ;D[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you, But yes everything is correct and done right. After he had downloaded jre8 he was able to run the server. The problem is that he coudn’t load up the client at all… cause for some reason it needed jre8 to open the client its self… strange id say. Also when u connect someone to you’re server it would be your ip but in this case (mine). can u do some searches and maybe help me figure this one out?</p>
