    <title>Anti-Boosting System</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anti-boosting-system/544639</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been working on a new project. Everything seems to be set and such. I removed Pk points and added a whole different type of system. It rewards you cash for killing someone, you can&#39;t kill someone more than once and get a reward, and you can&#39;t login from more than one IP. This will most definitely not prevent boosting. Our staff is active enough to somewhat monitor boosting, but I was wondering if anyone had a better method to prevent boosting? I&#39;ve been brainstorming and none of my ideas truly seem &quot;secure&quot;. I don&#39;t want to be spoonfed, I want to learn from this. Does anyone have any ideas of a &quot;Anti-boost&quot; system?</description>

All it would take to bypass an ip/name would be two accounts and/or a proxy server. (A Lot of public ones) [quote=“Vain_, post:19, topic:544639”][quote author=Camballer link=topic=663515.msg4434808#msg4434808 date=1404709971]</p>

<p>[ul][li]ip addresses can easily be changed.[/li][li]accounts can be created over and over again[/li][li]simply checking the ‘last’ killed, - players can alternate accounts[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>simple example:<br>
[players A, B, C]</p>
<p>[A] kills [B] gets pk points<br>
[A] kills [B] gets nothing<br>
[A] kills [C] gets pk points<br>
[A] kills [B] gets pk points<br>
[A] kills [C] gets pk points</p>
<p>etc…</p>
<p>checks for the address, players can simply connect to another client.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">things i would do:</span><br>
log all ip addresses that every account connects from. this will be useful in many other things.<br>
cross check all ips and accounts before doing logic of the pk points.</p>
<p>log all users killed by you, and all accounts you’ve killed.<br>
i wouldn’t give them points if you’ve killed them within x amount of time<br>
i wouldn’t give them points if they’ve killed them more than they’ve won fights.</p>
<p>kdr system.<br>
if your kdr is too horrible, then you cannot ‘gain’ pk points from this account ?<br>
public viewing, so if it’s ‘too perfect’ you’re noticed.</p>
<p>you could also do something a little unique:<br>
make pk points in the server, dependent on how many players are in the server.</p>
<pre><code>each player starts with [x] pk points.
[A] kills [B]
[A]'s points +1
[B]'s points -1

this will make boosting more obvious / pk points harder to get / kdr more valuable.

if you do this system, you should also create another method of obtaining some pk points so the 'economy' isn't dry due to lack of players. such as voting for some. a quest. a boss. anything. 
</code></pre>
<p>just don’t allow players to continually +1 every time they kill a player.[/quote]</p>
<p>Should probably do that in a code tag lol. [ b] is bold <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

<p>you could simply have both people, or simply on person on a vpn, and merely have the other friend switching accounts.</p>
<p>unless all these ips are logged at all times (every single address, and which account) then you have no validation</p>
<p>the ip logs will also be useful in cross checking for something like</p>
<p>[A] connected from 1.2.3.4 in the past<br>
[A] is currently connecting from 2.3.4.5<br>
[B] connected from 2.3.4.5 in the past<br>
[B] is currently connecting from 3.4.5.6</p>
<p>and not let these two benefit each other due to the address conflict.</p>
<p>this will greatly reduce the chances of public vpns being used because once its used, for someone, nobody else could use it.</p>

              <p>sk8r, I’ve been trying to implement a method under the void applyDead, to send me a message of who killed who every time there’s a death. I can’t seem to write it correctly and get no errors. There always seems to be a problem. Any clues? Sorry I haven’t done this in a long time.</p>

              <p>Save the player id and player name of the last ~5 people they killed. (player ID doesn’t matter as much unless it’s a unique ID or if it hadn’t changed since they logged in. Otherwise this would throw the system out of track)<br>
Monitor the kills each time they kill another player. If a players name keeps popping up more than usual, like every other kill or more, chances are he is boosting and you should flag his account (That doesn’t mean insta ban. Sometimes kids just like to pvp each other over and over…)</p>
