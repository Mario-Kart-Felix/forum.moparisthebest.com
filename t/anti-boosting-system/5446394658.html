<p>yeah that’s assuming all the methods were in place to prevent boosting in the first place, the player would have to change their ip, and use an alternate account in order to get one kill. seems like a lot of effort to go through for one kill and not many would keep it up anyway.</p>

<p>Well the system I have right now seems a bit faulty. The UID system sounds the most efficient, but I wouldn’t exactly know where to start on that.</p>

        <p>many people that play servers usually play with their friends. and if you’re going to boost (cheat) you would want to do it with someone you know/trust, correct?</p>
<p>you could simply have both people, or simply on person on a vpn, and merely have the other friend switching accounts.</p>
<p>unless all these ips are logged at all times (every single address, and which account) then you have no validation</p>
<p>the ip logs will also be useful in cross checking for something like</p>
<p>[A] connected from 1.2.3.4 in the past<br>
[A] is currently connecting from 2.3.4.5<br>
[B] connected from 2.3.4.5 in the past<br>
[B] is currently connecting from 3.4.5.6</p>
<p>and not let these two benefit each other due to the address conflict.</p>
<p>this will greatly reduce the chances of public vpns being used because once its used, for someone, nobody else could use it.</p>

        <p>Save last 5 kills. All 5 require unique names and ip’s. Resets every 24 hours.<br>

<p>your current checks for player similarities are bad. you need more logical checks<br>

</aside>
<p>in reality, there will be no way to fully stop boosting. you will need systems in place to check all possibilities, but you will still have to monitor it yourself.</p>
<p>[ul][li]ip addresses can easily be changed.[/li][li]accounts can be created over and over again[/li][li]simply checking the ‘last’ killed, - players can alternate accounts[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>simple example:<br>
[players A, B, C]</p>
<p>[A] kills [B] gets pk points<br>
[A] kills [B] gets nothing<br>
[A] kills [C] gets pk points<br>
[A] kills [B] gets pk points<br>
[A] kills [C] gets pk points</p>
<p>etc…</p>
<p>checks for the address, players can simply connect to another client.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">things i would do:</span><br>
log all ip addresses that every account connects from. this will be useful in many other things.<br>
cross check all ips and accounts before doing logic of the pk points.</p>
<p>log all users killed by you, and all accounts you’ve killed.<br>
i wouldn’t give them points if you’ve killed them within x amount of time<br>
i wouldn’t give them points if they’ve killed them more than they’ve won fights.</p>
<p>kdr system.<br>
if your kdr is too horrible, then you cannot ‘gain’ pk points from this account ?<br>
public viewing, so if it’s ‘too perfect’ you’re noticed.</p>
<p>you could also do something a little unique:<br>
make pk points in the server, dependent on how many players are in the server.</p>
<pre><code>each player starts with [x] pk points.
[A] kills [B]
[A]'s points +1
[B]'s points -1

this will make boosting more obvious / pk points harder to get / kdr more valuable.

if you do this system, you should also create another method of obtaining some pk points so the 'economy' isn't dry due to lack of players. such as voting for some. a quest. a boss. anything. 
</code></pre>
<p>just don’t allow players to continually +1 every time they kill a player.[/quote]</p>
<p>Should probably do that in a code tag lol. [ b] is bold <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eyeae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
