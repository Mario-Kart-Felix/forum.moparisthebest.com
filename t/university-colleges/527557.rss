    <description>Moparscape users who are currently in or graduated from college... Mind posting which schools you have gone?
I am in a college decision process and I would like to know which schools you have gone to?
I don&#39;t mind if u post ur stats like(gpa,ecs,sat/act) 
Just out of curiosity. I don&#39;t expect Ivy League grads but just some nice wholesome exp abt the university u went to
(Undergrad exp perferrably(you know.. Social and campus life...courses are they.... Rigorous))</description>

I know tons of kids that go to Purdue from my school and we have programs here in Engineering through Purdue that I have taken so I’m really not all that worried about getting into<br>
Purdue. UChicago has sent me a shirt, probably about 20 fliers, and at least 5 letters, so I figured they will accept me there based on how much mail I am getting. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> But I really don’t know too much about college admissions so maybe UChicago won’t admit me but if they sent me a free shirt I figure they want me. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Seems like a lot of effort just to decline someone to me.</p>

<p>Our school doesn’t participate in the Math Olympiad or anything like that. The only awards that I have received are awards given by the school. I pretty much have gotten all of the science and math awards, but I’m not sure what all that is worth.</p>

I know this is meant for graduates and whatnot, but maybe I can add to the conversation somewhat as I’m going through the college decision process. I scored a 33 on the ACT. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> Nothing all that great that will set me apart. I joke around and say I’m illiterate since English is my weak side. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I really would absolutely love to go to MIT and am working on a portfolio with some ideas that I have been working on. I’m more of an introvert so I don’t really care about the social aspect of college <span class="bbcode-i">that much</span>. Personally the only goals I want is to get away from the small town I live in, do something with my life, and be surrounded by people that make me feel stupid rather than hicks. To me it is all about the rankings and prestige of the university. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> And the price of course, but I am eligible for a lot of financial aid so usually it is ok. I also would prefer courses to be rigorous as in no busy work but a few problems that may take your five friends 2 hours to solve or something. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>What are you looking for in a college chill? Universities come is all sorts of shapes and sizes haha.<br>
[/quote]<br>
33 is a very good score! What is your breakdown? I am not great with English my self as I am a abc. MIT is my favorite university but its wayyyyyy too hard to get in. One can get into Harvard but not MIT.<br>
I am looking forward to JHU and CMU also Cornell. Swarthmore is also in consideration<br>
But of course I do have some SUNY schools as safety as I am residing ny resident.<br>
You can get 4.0 weighted gpa ranked top 1% gpa and perfect act or sats<br>
And easily rejected.<br>
I know from previous valedictorians in my district.<br>
Do you have special ecs? Like sports clubs vol, etc[/quote]<br>
I got a 30 in English, a 35 in Math, a 36 in Science, a 30 in Critical Reading, and an 8 in Writing.</p>
<p>[quote=“chillwitm888, post:22, topic:527557”]You can get 4.0 weighted gpa ranked top 1% gpa and perfect act or sats And easily rejected.[/quote] Yeah I know, there’s no “secret formula” to get into MIT haha. Harvard recently started a financial aid program in 08 or something that I was unaware of so I am probably going to be applying there too.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s pretty much my plan too. I’m shooting high but I have a safety net just in case haha. I plan on applying to UChicago because they’ve been pestering me just about every week, are close to where I live, and are a really good school to boot. And just in case I don’t get accepted there I’ll just go to Purdue.</p>

<p>Yeah, but not a lot. I played/am playing football my freshman through senior year and lettered varsity my junior and senior year. I am in German club. I have a few hours of volunteer work haha. I’m probably going to join Nation Honors Society this year too. Only thing I am probably worried about is community service crap. Hopefully college’s won’t worry that much haha.</p>

<p>Then you’d be surprised at the type of people who are accepted into and attend such high-tier schools. There is no such “Ivy League maturity”; that notion is utterly ludicrous.</p>

33 is a very good score! What is your breakdown? I am not great with English my self as I am a abc. MIT is my favorite university but its wayyyyyy too hard to get in. One can get into Harvard but not MIT.<br>
I am looking forward to JHU and CMU also Cornell. Swarthmore is also in consideration<br>
But of course I do have some SUNY schools as safety as I am residing ny resident.<br>
You can get 4.0 weighted gpa ranked top 1% gpa and perfect act or sats<br>
And easily rejected.<br>
I know from previous valedictorians in my district.<br>
Do you have special ecs? Like sports clubs vol, etc</p>

Clayton seems pretty okay, is the env crowded or quiet?<br>
Btw when after oct when I take my sat, and I post my stats do u mind chancing me? Some schools I’m considering is Carnegie m. And Jhu. I also got to have a higher gpa… Hopefully this year[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah it goes by that a lot these days.(Gordon College I mean) The general academic classes averaged about 15-25 people per class. The actual specialty classes were less more like 10-20. I stayed in the dorms so it was always nice there. Good food too for what it’s worth. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Depending on your gpa/sat scores most universities will require you to take a “compass” type test at their school anyway so it really doesn’t matter. I took one at Griffin Technical College and it said I qualified for all of their academic classes etc. When i went to Clayton I took theirs and it said I flunk their science portion. Good thing for me though was I wasn’t required to take any for my major(s).</p>
<p>If you want more information on the campus etc though feel free to skype me : eddieconnerrsps</p>

              <p>My Gpa is around a 3.4, I can raise it just about a 4.5w since i have a rigorous senior course load (if i get atleast 90+ in everything) (if i do… ill get placed back to number 1)<br>
i am ranked around top 8% atm  and first graduating class…  you really have to improve your class rank, or else there is no chance of you getting in to CMU 10% if your lucky… Do you have any special Extra curriculars or any at all? mind mentioning some?<br>
Class rank is very important, your sat is at like 50th percentile and CMU i believe<br>
You should see Cooper union, its freakin awesome!! (but impossible to get in but best C.S major )</p>
