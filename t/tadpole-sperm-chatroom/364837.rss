    <description>Rumpetroll, a Norwegian chat site that lets you swim around in a black morass in the guise of a tadpole.

The concept is pretty simple. Just click on over to the site, where a school of tadpoles (which… um… look like something else) are swimming about; type in “Name: Your Name” and start chatting. You can use your mouse to direct your tadpole around the screen.

According to one of the creators, Daniel Mahal (the site was created by four Norwegian developers and designers), Rumpetroll is “a project to explore what modern browsers can do that is not yet viable for commercial projects.” (Sidenote: The word is Norwegian for “tadpole” and “a** troll.”)

And how does it work? “We use WebSockets to keep the connection between browser and server alive at all times, this makes it really fast,” Mahal says. “One tadpole sends at most five updates per second to the server, which in turn broadcasts it to every other tadpole. The WebSocket server is implemented in Ruby with the glorious EventMachine and em-websocket. HTML files are hosted on Media Temple and the WebSocket server runs on a Joyent SmartMachine. The virtual pond is drawn with the HTML5 Canvas element.”</description>
