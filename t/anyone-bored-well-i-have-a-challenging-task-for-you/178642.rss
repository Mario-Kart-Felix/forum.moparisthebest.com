    <description> :D kk well i was bored on my server with cople of my friends so we all thought it would be rele cool to make are own little capture the flag!!
btw: im kinda a noob at all this stuff, or id be doing it myself!! plz dont make fun of me!

well heres my plan: Make in on a big field and have a sara flag at one end and zammy at other. then have a line across the middle of field to split the sides (zammy and sara)! then have 9 squares on ea side for the flag at the end of their side to be safe area! and if possible make it so on sara side on sara can attack zammy, zammy cannot attack sara! and same on other side!!!

if you have any idea how to do this and are bored plz email me and tell me you know how so i can stop looking for someone to do it!

i would greatly appretiat this and you never know you could wanan use it too???!!! thanks :D   -peace

plz dont post anything negative... i know im a noob!!!
