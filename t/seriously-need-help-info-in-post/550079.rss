    <description>Ok. So I downloaded a client to code and play on. Train my coding skills. I can get the client to load just fine using Eclipse and the folder for the Client. However, I can not correctly jar the file. Maybe the jar file is correct, idk. I keep getting this error. My friend also got the same error from the public jar.

That error only pops up for a split second before closing.

This error happens after downloading the cache and trying to load the main title screen. Please help.
