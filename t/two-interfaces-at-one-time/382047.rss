    <title>Two Interfaces at One Time?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/two-interfaces-at-one-time/382047</link>
    <description>I am currently running a 508 and wanted to know if its possible to have two interfaces up and one time? For example, I have a timer set up to show up in the bottom right... but when you go into Godwars, you can&#39;t see the timer because the Godwars kill count interface (upper right) overrides it... I would like to use both at the same time because they wouldn&#39;t clash, and are located at different spot on the screen. Is this possible?</description>
