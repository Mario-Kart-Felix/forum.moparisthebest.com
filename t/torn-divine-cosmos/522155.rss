    <title>Torn - Divine Cosmos</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/torn-divine-cosmos/522155</link>
    <description>Torn finally returns. We have left for a few months to go into a beta stage that I only allowed
20 dedicated testers have access to. Now we are back, and with a whole new realm, and
idea. The graphics, unbeatable. The social interaction and community, undeniable. The
economy, flawless. This is TORN, with 2 worlds. World 1 - Training and Pking
World 2 - Minigames. We have launched a new minigame called: THE DIVINE COSMOS.
The object? Simple. Collect points. As the master control panel in tron said: End of Line.</description>
