    <description>Hi, I am new here although my account may be old... I don&#39;t log in much because I quit Runescape/Runescape private servers for a long time, but I&#39;m back now. Now that we have established that - lets get on with it.

Hi, I am trying to make a Runescape web client for my &quot;to be&quot; server ( i know how to make a server I have made plenty in the past) but before iI make the server I&#39;m wanting to make the web client... I need someone to help me make/code it into my website - http://www.rs2forum.net (id appreciate it if you signed up/made an account) on my site the web client will be located at http://www.rs2forum.net/webclient/client-load.php    (IE or Opera is NOT compatible with the page at this time)
please add me on MSN messenger: th3realj0k@live.com or you can just reply here... either way is fine. I know this post is complete copy pasta (meaning - attempting to use correct grammar/punctuation but completely failing at it) so yea... please help!</description>
