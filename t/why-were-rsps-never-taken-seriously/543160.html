I think, from my perspective atleast, I took RSPS atleast somewhat seriously. But after not seeing any results, why would one try to take RSPS seriously?</p>
<p>I mean, look at Ry’s server, the server you said is taken seriously. It is, hands-down, taken seriously, but what’s the result of that work? Arios, probably the best remake imo, doesn’t get a good amount of players. Sure, in their first day they had 50+ players, but after that, they averaged 9.</p>

        <p>The lack of Java knowledge does have a good bit to do with it. The people who programmed, and still do program, servers have little to no knowledge. Those who do are probably not working on a private server of a game where their “copy” of the game can be shut down by Jagex.</p>

<p>Probably because most people who hop into the RSPS scene are not familiar with java. Like me! When I started I new close to nothing about java but I used RSPS as a gateway to more advanced things.</p>
<p>The logic behind this is: If you have enough talent in Java to make an awesome server, why not make your own game?</p>
<p>If you make your own game you can theoretically make money off of it and you won’t have to worry about copyright or anything. This is what most people do (including myself). This is the reason why most RSPS’s are really bad or just have some different variables changed in them.</p>

<p>Take a look at WoW private servers… Their community has an entirely different attitude than ours.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>What? Do they actually work hard to make their servers as close to WoW as possible? WoW is a completely different game[/quote]<br>
The entire attitude is completely different. No one is in it for the money, they all work together on open source, if someone doesn’t understand the server they will help explain it, etc.</p>

        <p>My point wasn’t about remakes. Honestly, 2006 remakes were vastly population up until the release of OSRS. Look at David’s, his had THOUSANDS of players. But now, remakes are all but pointless unless you are looking to fill the gap of right before EOC came out. Even then, the point of RSPS in my opinion was to provide a unique experience based on the perceptions of the creators as to what RS should be like. And for quite a few years now it has become a bunch of pk, spawn, and ez-mode servers that provide no depth or challenge. For a while Runite had a great concept but even that was eventually snuffed.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the concept of Runescape has provided the best for both people who want to skill, kill, and player kill. And with Jagex’ long standing refusal to listen to anyone but HLF elitists, this was supposed to be the change that people wanted. Idk, I just expected more lol.</p>

<p>Well remember that this is a multiplayer game. People will start whining about how they aren’t getting as much random encounters as friends or they never get any at all. With multiplayer, all players must be treated equal by the developers.</p>

        <p>I think because at the beginning of RSPS’, it was all new to everyone, unique at the very start. But nowadays there is a lack of anything unique that owners are so scared to create anything new incase their server fails. Plus there is a lack of ANY basic java knowledge from most of the so-called “server owners”. Most are little kids who just leech a server and change the name of the server and publish it as their own… Its kind of a joke of how easy it is for children with no knowledge of the language of java to act as if they have what it takes to make a server…</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be entirely random. If we had more instanced events, created new areas (which is entirely possible now), new skills, etc. it would be much more popular. The problem is no one wants to put the time in to create that content, and the tools available certainly aren’t the greatest for doing so.</p>

<p>Back in the day it required more knowledge and there still wasn’t much innovation. People wanted everything easy and ready to go for them to just host. Even when there was only one common source that everything derived from and the tutorials worked almost universally people didn’t want to take the time to learn how to properly add them and wanted it spoon fed.</p>

[7:18:41 PM] Sk8rdude (Lumusaria): I was just in the server advert section… And wow. So many servers are like “we’re new and unique” and when I get in the thread, it’s literally the same shit over and over.</p>

<p>Very good point. I guess what I am also trying to say is that no one even tries to change spawn placements or even basic shit. Correct me if I’m wrong, but is it really that hard to change spawn coordinates, space things out so it isn’t localized to one specific location (ex: Edgeville filled with fucking NPCs)? I mean by now I cannot really expect people to recode base revisions from the ground up, but at least attempt to give an individual, unique idea. Sini you refuse to use already created bases because they are flawed, however people obviously have no problem copying and pasting things. What I am trying to say is that Bezza’s server wasn’t “overly” special, but his location, forms of training, variety, etc. did make it at least worth playing for hours and coming back. With minimal knowledge and effort, it seems like it is possible to begin a server and do the right fucking thing, which is make it your own.</p>

This…<br>
And.<br>
[7:18:41 PM] Sk8rdude (Lumusaria): I was just in the server advert section… And wow. So many servers are like “we’re new and unique” and when I get in the thread, it’s literally the same shit over and over.[/quote]<br>
yesyesyesyesyes. I go onto that board to point out the horrible flawed servers, as there are currently no servers worth playing because they have no perspective or longevity.</p>

        <p>It’s just a OCD I have where if something isn’t RIGHT then I MUST fix it. Just doesn’t fit with the mold of RSPS, which is fine. I love doing side things as a hobby like innovating solutions (see: recent threads). I probably will never own and run a major RSPS but thats mostly because I have my career going right now. This is just a hobby, for some people its a job, and to those people I say ‘Wow’ hahaha.</p>

        <p>Most people only take something serious when there is a monetary reward involved. Due to Jagex strict pursuit of protecting its IP its really hard to motivate those to do so. like sinisoul said would you really want to take Runescape serious and take the risk of becoming the next Eric Snellman or would you want to spend your time doing something less risky?</p>
<p>Out of experience the money is great but it does not take too long for Jagex lawyers to be knocking at your door.</p>

        <p>Also the same reason why no other private servers of games are taken seriously. They are immature children who think they know what they’re talking about because they can C&amp;P/change names &amp; numbers. They usually keep it very fast and easy and don’t put much effort into it because they know that’s what other immature children are wanting to play. It’s not just rsps, it’s with any game’s private servers.</p>
