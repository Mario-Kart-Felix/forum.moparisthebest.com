<p>I’m calling bullshit until I see it, we’re the only community to actually in depth question SS and their activities, just look at the SoulSplit office thread. If anyone knew about it, we would. It actually took myself and Tree a good 2-3 hours one day researching their registered company and traders etc, we found nothing.</p>

<p>It would not be in Jagex interest to do something like this given their stance on the Runescape IP and the fact that by doing it for one with give other server owners the idea that they may also be able to strike a deal with JaGex.</p>

        <blockquote>Dear Reader,
<p>Please read this mail properly, as there are a couple of good arguments in it, i friendly ask you to actually think about it, and not just click “delete” or send me a copied email back that you sent to everyone mailing you about private server copyright.<br>
I also apologize for any grammatical mistakes, I myself am dutch, Although i do try my best on writing as proper Englsh as possible.</p>
<p>I am Pim de Witte, I live in the Netherlands and I am the owner of <a href="http://www.soulsplit.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.soulsplit.com</a>.</p>
<p>I came up with an idea that might change the way people look at JaGex dramatically, because JaGex has great people working at them and that should be shared with the world.<br>
This idea has to do with a certain way of approaching Private servers in a different way then current Gaming Company and Software developers do it.<br>
I have a huge impact on the RuneScape Private Server community, i am basically an example for the owners of private servers and i have a lot of experience, and a lot of players, and that’s why i think i could help you<br>
realise this idea.<br>
Soulsplit has been up for 1 and a half year.</p>
<p>If you agree with my idea, we will expend to different revisions as well, this will result in our total player count to raise dramatically…<br>
We are planning on taking over the majority of RSPS by hosting high-quality servers with good management and programmers.</p>
<p>I have recently called you about my idea about RuneScape Private Servers.<br>
Other gaming companies (Blizzard) are “fighting” against them, now I came up with the following idea:</p>
<p>Why don’t you (Starting with soulsplit) make personal contracts/deals with large Private servers allowing them to host their(or you may call them your) game client in return for a share of the profit.</p>
<p>These days there is a lot of money going around in RuneScape private servers, myself i think the amounts that i sell items for in my Item Shop are insane (27K USD), and must be shared with the original owner of the content who made this all possible for us.<br>
I am not sure if you knew this already, but sharing profits with these servers could result you in gaining a lot of extra money on monthly basis.<br>
The majority of the people who play RSPS are no longer interested in RuneScape, that’s why i think fighting against private servers does not result in anything good for RuneScape.<br>
By doing this properly you can gain a lot of money from it , the last month I have raised $27 000 USD (Sales volume ) from <a href="http://soulsplit.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">soulsplit.com</a> (which I think should be shared with JaGex).<br>
You will basically give your people the oppertunity to run some kind of business, and sharing a certain percentage of the Sales volume (or profit) with JaGex, leading into a great learning experience for the developers and owners of the private servers, and some extra publicity for JaGex (since no other gaming company has done this before).</p>
<p>I do realise that sueing someone costs a lot of time and money for your company. This way will spare you a lot of time and will raise you money with basically having nothing extra to do.</p>
<p>I don’t think you have anything to lose if we can make such a deal.<br>
May you be interested in making some kind of contract/deal about this, please mail me back. I think this is very likely for you as well, because let’s say i have to share 25% of my sales volume with JaGex , that will be $6750 a month.</p>
<p>Conditions will be:<br>
Sharing a certain percentage(yet to be discussed) of the sales volume or profit with JaGex.<br>
The client must be given to JaGex open source, to prove that there are no malicious items in it. If asked for this must also be done with the server.<br>
I will program and manage everything myself or with my second developer, i will not ask for any help or code from JaGex.<br>
I am not “working” for JaGex as an employee, i basically buy the rights to host my server for a certain share of my profit.</p>
<p>I have learned so much from this and I would hate to bring it down, simply because I love working with and for it so much<br>
I spend 4-8 hours a day managing the server, in weekends I try to add content, I even hire a second developer because it is simply too much work for me on my own.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Ashi, post:46, topic:543160”][quote=Pim]Dear Reader,</p>
<p>Please read this mail properly, as there are a couple of good arguments in it, i friendly ask you to actually think about it, and not just click “delete” or send me a copied email back that you sent to everyone mailing you about private server copyright.<br>
I also apologize for any grammatical mistakes, I myself am dutch, Although i do try my best on writing as proper Englsh as possible.</p>
<p>I am Pim de Witte, I live in the Netherlands and I am the owner of <a href="http://www.soulsplit.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.soulsplit.com</a>.</p>
<p>I came up with an idea that might change the way people look at JaGex dramatically, because JaGex has great people working at them and that should be shared with the world.<br>
This idea has to do with a certain way of approaching Private servers in a different way then current Gaming Company and Software developers do it.<br>
I have a huge impact on the RuneScape Private Server community, i am basically an example for the owners of private servers and i have a lot of experience, and a lot of players, and that’s why i think i could help you<br>
realise this idea.<br>
Soulsplit has been up for 1 and a half year.</p>
<p>If you agree with my idea, we will expend to different revisions as well, this will result in our total player count to raise dramatically…<br>
We are planning on taking over the majority of RSPS by hosting high-quality servers with good management and programmers.</p>
<p>I have recently called you about my idea about RuneScape Private Servers.<br>
Other gaming companies (Blizzard) are “fighting” against them, now I came up with the following idea:</p>
<p>Why don’t you (Starting with soulsplit) make personal contracts/deals with large Private servers allowing them to host their(or you may call them your) game client in return for a share of the profit.</p>
<p>These days there is a lot of money going around in RuneScape private servers, myself i think the amounts that i sell items for in my Item Shop are insane (27K USD), and must be shared with the original owner of the content who made this all possible for us.<br>
I am not sure if you knew this already, but sharing profits with these servers could result you in gaining a lot of extra money on monthly basis.<br>
The majority of the people who play RSPS are no longer interested in RuneScape, that’s why i think fighting against private servers does not result in anything good for RuneScape.<br>
By doing this properly you can gain a lot of money from it , the last month I have raised $27 000 USD (Sales volume ) from <a href="http://soulsplit.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">soulsplit.com</a> (which I think should be shared with JaGex).<br>
You will basically give your people the oppertunity to run some kind of business, and sharing a certain percentage of the Sales volume (or profit) with JaGex, leading into a great learning experience for the developers and owners of the private servers, and some extra publicity for JaGex (since no other gaming company has done this before).</p>
<p>I do realise that sueing someone costs a lot of time and money for your company. This way will spare you a lot of time and will raise you money with basically having nothing extra to do.</p>
<p>I don’t think you have anything to lose if we can make such a deal.<br>
May you be interested in making some kind of contract/deal about this, please mail me back. I think this is very likely for you as well, because let’s say i have to share 25% of my sales volume with JaGex , that will be $6750 a month.</p>
<p>Conditions will be:<br>
Sharing a certain percentage(yet to be discussed) of the sales volume or profit with JaGex.<br>
The client must be given to JaGex open source, to prove that there are no malicious items in it. If asked for this must also be done with the server.<br>
I will program and manage everything myself or with my second developer, i will not ask for any help or code from JaGex.<br>
I am not “working” for JaGex as an employee, i basically buy the rights to host my server for a certain share of my profit.</p>
<p>I have learned so much from this and I would hate to bring it down, simply because I love working with and for it so much<br>
I spend 4-8 hours a day managing the server, in weekends I try to add content, I even hire a second developer because it is simply too much work for me on my own.</p>
<p>I hope you are interested in doing business.</p>

<p>You know things can be faked… Even if this email is real, does’t mean they accepted the offer. They’re not that poor of a company to make a deal which they gain a few thousand a month to let a RSPS be hosted…</p>

<p>Yah I agree guys soulsplit is the number one rsps(I think) out there if Jagex wanted to take them down they would have took them down. There has to be some sort of deal there.</p>

<p>If it “wasn’t worth their time” why did empscape go down, or any other big servers"?<br>
It’s not even about a court case, they’ll have your site taken down. I’m sure with the money they get from SS they could easily get a court case sorted with a bunch of 14 year olds parents.</p>

<p>You’re so ignorant and naive it’s un-fudgeing-real. SoulSplit is a registered company with a fully fledged headquarters and office with over 20 full time employees. Please tell me at what point they’re dealing with 14 year olds? To take on a company that’s even that small in comparison to JaGeX (bearing in mind Jagex is estimated at around 130-170 employees from what I remember of the last discussion on this) is going to cost them a fudge tonne of money. The CEO of SS, Pim or whatever his name is, wouldn’t think twice about investing all of his budget and savings to save his company and not be on the breadline, if he pays out the amount he could pay out there would be one hell of a size of a court case lasting months between the two firms.</p>
<p>TL;DR, It would indeed be a very large deal for JaGeX to take on SS and due to the high amounts of revenue on either side there’s a very large chance that it could cost more than it’s worth.</p>

False, it can happen in a copyright infringement case but there’s a large chance of it not unless the court appoints the guilty party to pay all attorney fees (court awarded attorney fees). No win, no fee doesn’t apply to copyright infringement cases of this scale, this would be a very large scale case, not a national helpline claim against your place of work and certainly not one tiny little small “guilty”, both sides would be arguing over intellectual property and game assets with SS trying to prove their manipulation of the protocol and sustained use of game assets to not be their own however all other intellectual property is. The long story short is that there’s a hundred and one get out of jail free clauses they could abuse to get out of Jagex’s grasp, they may be forced to terminate all game clients and pay a small fee to Jagex but won’t be fully sued. First and foremost the Auteurswet, the Dutch copyright law only states that copyrighted material is literature, science or art. This means that Jagex have a harder case already with the Auteurswet blocking them straight off the bat.</p>
<p>No, I’m not a kid. From what I’m seeing here you know fudge all.</p>

Source code is not regarded as literature in a large number of countries. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=is+source+code+literature&amp;oq=is+source+code+literature&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57.2783j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This</a> shows that clearly. The game assets such as sprites were always going to be what they could pass off as copyright but there are ways to get around it by simple edits, it takes a lot of time and a lot of man hours to do but it may well have been done since SS has the power to do that. That’s guesswork due to the fact I’ve not looked through the SS cache to see if any changes have been made. As I stated the last time, it’s likely to not be one lawyer due to the size of the companies but a team of lawyers. From what I remember Jagex subcontracted a whole firm of lawyers to handle the <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> attempted lawsuit when they were trying to take that down.</p>
<p>If I were Jagex I’d weigh up how much it was going to cost and act then, I almost certainly wouldn’t give up the integrity of the company I’ve worked on for years along with the game for the sake of 50 grand.</p>
