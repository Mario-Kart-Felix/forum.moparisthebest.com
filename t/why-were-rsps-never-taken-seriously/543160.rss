    <title>Why Were RSPS Never Taken Seriously?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-were-rsps-never-taken-seriously/543160</link>
    <description>Maybe it was just a different game to get into, but I feel like people were trying harder in the newer years of RSPS than they are now. Besides David and Ry&#39;s servers I can&#39;t remember the last time I saw a well rounded server. I am pretty sure the last &quot;eco&quot; server that went sufficiently well was Bezza&#39;s PKisle.

But what gives? Obviously there is an economic incentive to keep players coming back, to provide a stable foundation that removes the insecurity that most servers provide due to their instability. Is it just because it is a child&#39;s game now and no one knowledgeable is able to seriously sit down and review code and improve on the same damn bases that we as a community have been using for years?

Or is it the fear of Jagex coming down with the lawsuit hammer? I just need some clarification, because I have always wondered why the standards of RSPS fell so quickly.</description>

<p>This would have been an amazing addition, not only would Jagex not have to waste resources trying to chase down every single last one of us, it would completely change how things are done, around here and in general. All the “halp my firend cant conect” threads would all be on Jagex’s forums, and all that support would taken care of there, and this would, as you mention, change the motives of development. If you were one of those who wanted to just host a server could do so with (probably) easy setup, just like you would a Minecraft server. Assuming the communities would arise, the RSPS communities would then become private server modding communities, and people would here would be hear to actually mod the games, not just download and host. That wouldn’t fix the ones who wish to be spoon-fed and all, but that’s another thread.</p>

<p>If only all people felt this way. This isn’t just a problem in RSPS’s, it’s an issue in all game development, just take a look at EA.</p>

              <p>Runescape was popular in the early 00’s because it had very low system requirements and a very structured and straightforward gameplay environment which appealed to many young people. Interest in the game was mostly spread by word of mouth, on BBS or through young people. The idiosyncratic nature of the gameplay does not translate well into marketing schemes or “Improvement” teams efforts to “Balance” or “Upgrade” the game.</p>
<p>The original game should have been left alone; Andrew Gower should have made it open source and let people run their own servers. RS2 should have been totally open source. You should have been able to play on the official servers or do your own modding etc.</p>
<p>The low system requirements and portability of Runescape would have opened up a whole world of gaming and development for many young people. Unfortunately people were very greedy and basically it’s all just a commercial scheme now. If people wanted to play a cheap java clone of Everquest or Asherons Call, they would. And with free MMORPGs like NWN or LOTR:O there’s no reason to play RS with the current state of affairs.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Elrick, post:9, topic:543160”]My point wasn’t about remakes. Honestly, 2006 remakes were vastly population up until the release of OSRS. Look at David’s, his had THOUSANDS of players. But now, remakes are all but pointless unless you are looking to fill the gap of right before EOC came out. Even then, the point of RSPS in my opinion was to provide a unique experience based on the perceptions of the creators as to what RS should be like. And for quite a few years now it has become a bunch of pk, spawn, and ez-mode servers that provide no depth or challenge. For a while Runite had a great concept but even that was eventually snuffed.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the concept of Runescape has provided the best for both people who want to skill, kill, and player kill. And with Jagex’ long standing refusal to listen to anyone but HLF elitists, this was supposed to be the change that people wanted. Idk, I just expected more lol.[/quote]</p>
<p>I just wanted to add in this, things like lack of creativity are the reasons I quit 8 years ago I hope some advancements have come since then, I am trying to get a dev team together at the moment I have a pretty good idea going on at this moment for a server, I’m in the porces of trying to figure out how the last 8 years of not visitint this site and myold server code compute to what there is currently lol its  way different</p>

<p>It also didn’t matter back then if your RSPS was adequately functional because that was really the only access to being able to play the 07 version of the game. Now that they’ve been out awhile and Jagex re-released their own 07, the stakes are higher. But I think the community is also a lot smaller.</p>

              <p>to be honest i think its just rsps’s are really outdated all the people who used to play rsps’s and runescape in general have kinda grown up and gone off to do more mature things. not gunna lie though rsps shiz always pulls me back in somehow one way or another. i mean runescape has changed so much in the past like 2-3 years that like i went on rs a few days ago and nothing is really going on and worlds arent nearly as full as they used to be. runescape isnt fun at all anymore well i mean jagex’s version. i think the game is just outdated now. and i agree with the comments above about people spending money to bring players and not even get over 20 at once online. thats why im kinda iffy about my current project and might just make it a single player and release it and let people do what they want to it because i mean no reason in spending 6 months making the thing for no one to play so might as well just make a basis and let the community extend my ideas.</p>

              <p>I personally believe that it’s not really advertising with banners and top list sites and what not, I’ve seen people spend tons on advertisement slots and not get any players at all (Arham), I think it’s the connections you have more than anything. Not around here, but with people that actually live off of private servers, one thing that keeps people playing most games in general is if they have friends that play with them.</p>

<p>just keeping the server online and advertising isn’t enough</p>
<p>do you know how long Azaruth was online for? Over a year, and i doubt it ever surpassed 20 online at the same time. To get players you have to spend money</p>
<p>before it was called azaruth, the only time there was ever players online was when we had a mopar sponsor.</p>

Yeah, I don’t see how this is so special or right.</p>
<p>He didn’t even state anything. All he said was “servers were better back then”. No duh. We all think that.</p>
<p>Y’all really need to stop complaining about the issue and start becoming part of the solution.</p>

              <p>Well, honestly Arham’s ditto is true. He spent quite a bit of time setting up his alpha and beta stages, and a couple weeks later his beta is down to like 3 people and his forums are inactive. Yeah the server had its fair share of problems, but I’d seen some pretty stupid looking servers that are really poorly designed, and have larger populations than his.</p>
<p>Maybe the new generations of RSPS players are really that lazy and impatient. I mean we have discussed this opinion for a while now, but the more and more I look at RSPS, the communities that are thriving are the ones that provide no challenge in both exp rates and obtaining items, and are overall just Spawn shop, teleport riddled, pieces of shit. People just don’t want to take the time to help build an economy. However, this may be partially  because the longevity of most RSPS servers is only a couple months.</p>

<p>^this. My server is online for testing and developing purposes. I have players online daily because one of my friends (who’s been with me in other servers) constantly tells people to join and play. I haven’t even lifted a finger in advertising, nor have I spent any money on it.</p>

The release of oldschool runescape absolutely killed RSPS in my opinion. Most people left runescape because of EOC and to turn back the clock for somewhat of an oldschool experience and now they can get that with thousands of players on the official runescape website with absolute security of no down time.<br>
[/quote]<br>
That is why a lot of people did go to and quit RSPS.<br>
But they still didn’t manage to capture the era I loved.<br>
I loved the pre-600 era. Like around the 562 servers you see released. That was the best.<br>
(Yes, I know it’s your opinion, this is mine.)<br>
I like RSPS, as an owner and programmer of one, because I have the freedom to do what I want to <span class="bbcode-i">my runescape</span>. Not Jagex’s, not anyone else’s. Mine.[/quote]<br>
I definitely agree with everything you’re saying here. I honestly really enjoyed RS right before EoC came out (Not sure which revision that was), but the sad thing is I hardly ever see anything above 500. And the ones that do exist are not popular and die quickly.</p>

<p>The release of oldschool runescape absolutely killed RSPS in my opinion. Most people left runescape because of EOC and to turn back the clock for somewhat of an oldschool experience and now they can get that with thousands of players on the official runescape website with absolute security of no down time.</p>

<p>That is why a lot of people did go to and quit RSPS.<br>
But they still didn’t manage to capture the era I loved.<br>
I loved the pre-600 era. Like around the 562 servers you see released. That was the best.<br>
(Yes, I know it’s your opinion, this is mine.)<br>
I like RSPS, as an owner and programmer of one, because I have the freedom to do what I want to <span class="bbcode-i">my runescape</span>. Not Jagex’s, not anyone else’s. Mine.</p>
