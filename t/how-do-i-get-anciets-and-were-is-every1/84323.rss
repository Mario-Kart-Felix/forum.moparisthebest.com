              <p>Too many unknown variables in your question. First off id recommend turning off Caps Lock. Many would consider it a form of shouting using text.</p>
<p>Second, i have no idea which server you are connected to, therefore no idea if your on a populated one. I strongly suggest you read some stickys and look around the forum a bit more before trying again. After all, we must learn to walk before we can run.</p>
