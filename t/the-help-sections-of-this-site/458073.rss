    <title>The help sections of this site</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-help-sections-of-this-site/458073</link>
    <description>I&#39;m curious to know how many people use the help sections on these forums. I feel as if they aren&#39;t as helpful as they might seem to be. Another problem is that there are SO many topics it&#39;s really hard to find the subject you are interested in. Would it help if the help sections were divided by revision (317 or 503+)?


All input is great.</description>

<p>I don’t think splitting the board up will solve your problem. At the end of the day, you’ll have more cluttered boards.[/quote]More work for mods? Adding an type of board/sticky is more work for mods, if more work is all that it takes, we can always recruit more staff members. Having every revision in one section is messy, and for people who like to help out and are revision specific do not like going through topics to help out.</p>
<p>Why are the boards as bad as they are then? There HAS to be at least one way to fix them up. Splitting them by revision is only a mere idea.</p>

<p>OT:  People have helped me there before, I find it useful is you can at least provide info and don’t ask “hey guyz i uh need bh codes like now plz kthx oyea 100$ thru paypal to whoever gives”.  The only issue is that loads of posts there are about the exact same things, and from my knowledge, there’s no way to fix it.</p>

They probably don’t know how the forum rules work either; if their question is not replied to and is no longer on the front page, they’ll make a new topic.</p>

<p>I only rarely visit the help boards, but when I do it’s just a clusterfuck.</p>

              <p>I’m curious to know how many people use the help sections on these forums. I feel as if they aren’t as helpful as they might seem to be. Another problem is that there are SO many topics it’s really hard to find the subject you are interested in. Would it help if the help sections were divided by revision (317 or 503+)?</p>
<p>All input is great.</p>
