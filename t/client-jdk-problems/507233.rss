    <title>Client Jdk problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-jdk-problems/507233</link>
    <description>Hi, I have made my server and I have gotten it online. the one problem is every time I send my client to people the have to open up the run.bat and edit into it their version of JDK. I know for all the big rsps&#39;s you just download their client click it and your ready to play without having to right click on it and edit in ur vision of JDK. My question is how do I make my client able to run for other people without them having to edit in their JDK so they can just click and play.
 
Incase you don&#39;t get what I mean here is a photo. I want to stop others who download my client from getting this message and just being able to play http://gyazo.com/299cc4b96620cac010899895113fc3cb

Help would be soooo greatly appreciated</description>
