    <description>i have a small question. i have been wondering lately how the server and client codes communicate with the cache ive been looking thru the code and i havent found any code that specificlly loads the cache can any 1 tell me how that works? or does anyone really know anymore? have all the good coders left us with nothing more than a couple codes that have been leeched many times over? anyways plz answer my question i would apreciate it alot :o

(and on an unrelated note) does any 1 know the coords of pest control id really like to know cuz i got a new cache thats supposed to have it :P</description>
