    <title>How to use this system</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-use-this-system/261232</link>
    <description>When a user posts a topic, it will be sent here for approval. There is a little button on the moderation panel at the bottom of the topic (left-hand side) that will be called &#39;Filter Topic&#39;. After clicking this button, the topic will be moved back into the Server Tutorials board. If you do not want the topic to be approved, simply delete it. Storing topics in here is optional, as it really doesn&#39;t matter.

One other thing. If you do chose to delete the topic or just ignore it for whatever reason, it is recommended you private message the user to explain to them that they broke a rule. Visual Warnings should not be given out in here, as the user cannot view the topics in this section.

I think that&#39;s everything.

Edit: Now that I actually placed the right stickies in the right sections, I have one more thing to say. You can also unfilter topics back into this board if you don&#39;t like them anymore. That&#39;s more for archival purposes than anything, as you could just delete them in other cases.

Edit2: You may (optionally) use the following template when denying a tutorial:

[code=javascript]Hi,
 
The topic you recently submitted to the tutorial section was declined because (it was/showed):

[ul][li]A copy and paste tutorial[/li]
[li]An unnecessary tutorial (an action that doesn&#39;t require a tutorial to produce)[/li]
[li]You were unable to prove that you understood what you were talking about[/li]
[li]A list of several simple tutorials[/li]
[li]Incompleteness[/li][/ul]

 
We thank you for your tutorial, however we would ask that you next time follow the rules when posting a tutorial so it may be accepted.
 [/code]

Remember, any notification message need only be sent when a [i]tutorial[/i] has been denied, not just a help topic.

A recommendation: If you want to know exactly what to put in the message, I&#39;ve followed a simple procedure for a few months now. I use the topic text as a title to my message (e.g., Topic: How to use this system). I then quote the post and use it as my body. One line underneath the quote, I paste the above template. I append any special messages at the end of the last sentence of the template. If I want to stress any particular rules the person broke, I usually bold them.</description>

<p>I was already aware. I can’t create a fix for it because most of the visual warning system on this board was created by Mopar. He’s going to have to fix it. I was going to talk to him about it on the IRC a while back, but he’s basically never on, so… yeah.</p>

<p>For this, I have been using this format when pming the user:</p>
<blockquote>Usersnamehere,
<p>The topic you recently submitted to the tutorial section was declined because it was one of the following:<br>
[<em>] A copy and paste tutorial<br>
[</em>] An unnecessary tutorial (an action that doesn’t require a tutorial to produce)</p>
<p>We thank you for your tutorial, however we would ask that you next time follow the rules when posting a tutorial so it may be accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So maybe such a thing should be implemented so it automatically sends a pm to the user (like a warning does) when their tutorial is declined.</p>
