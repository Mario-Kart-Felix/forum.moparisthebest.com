    <description>Hey there! :)
I have som questions about clients and editing them:

- In what document do i change the background and those things? i cant find where to change the file name.

- If i don&#39;t want the default crowns, how do i delete em? and how do i put in my own ones?

- Do i 100% have to use .jag files as sprites? (i got both of evry single file anyways:D)

Questions bout server:

- Where do i find theese welcome message interfaces? so i could edit them (im on a mac atm, thats why i can&#39;t find out by searching the text thats already in it)

- How do i make commands like ::unmute ::unipban ::unban and those ones? (want shortcut instead of going to character files and removing it, with all the compile stuffs and that)

- How do i make a yell message so that evry1 can see it?

- [IMPORTANT] if i have done ALOT changes on the server and client, would it take long to compile? :D

- Does it matther where i put in the codes in the client.java? or is it good as long as its just in there?

As u see, theres quite many questions, but im complete new and i think i&#39;ve done kinda great from till now xD

<blockquote>If i don't want the default crowns, how do i delete em? and how do i put in my own ones?</blockquote> Follow a tut i cba to tell you how to do it.
The rest is kinda common sense, follow tutorials and use the search button.
