    <title>Hydrascape is once again not welcome[Updated 10/10/08]</title>

    <description>As it would seem a member of their community thought it would be rather amusing to spam these forums with their forum link.  We have had conflict with them in the past, so due to this, their forums, nor discussion about them in any way will result in a mute or ban depending on the severity.

This is the final straw, if the Hydrascape owners want to discuss this, they can all they want, however there is a very small chance the ban will be lifted.

We would also like to discourage you from going to Hydrascape , seeing as they are run by scammers, and [b]most likely[/b] try and steal your password.  If you are signed up at their forums and use the same forum password, [b]change your forum password here[/b].  If you have downloaded anything from there, we highly suggest scanning your computer for malicious files.</description>
