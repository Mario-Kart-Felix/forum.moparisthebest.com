    <description>EDIT EDIT EDIT: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,627069.msg4262199.html#msg4262199 this is the project now.




hi just wanted to let everyone know im making  a very unique rsps, im scrapping all runescape armour/weapon models and making my own making a unique set for each one giving them different names and everything i wanna make the most unique rsps ever then as well of that ima attempt on making custom objects which ive been having a lottttt of trouble with. everytime ive been trying to add the object its invisible but idc im sure ill figure it out. but ima be working on this a lottttt. right now im at designing process, and no im not just saying all this ive had experience i know how to add customs and everything. ima keep yall updated on everything with pics and videos and so on. and im doing all this by myself also lol. well i got one designer but he hasnt given me any designs yet except for from my last rsps that i quit. well wish me luck =].

EDIT EDIT EDIT: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,627069.msg4262199.html#msg4262199 this is the project now.



EDIT:

well its october and me and amy are working hard haha yes amy_webb is helping with the project.

here are my goals for this month:

-Finish atleast two islands
the way my custom maps are gunna work is theres gunna be different islands and teleports to each island or something instead of teleporting to varrock fally etc your gunna teleport to the different islands. this part takes a while because no clipping the islands takes forever! but its worth it. we are making everything custom, custom walls objects such as desk doors and all ores maybe trees idk they are already pretty good i dont see how we could make them any better but idk.

- make basic armour sets
we&#39;ve already finished 1 of the boss armour sets and a few swords and such but are plan isnt to start with the armour/ weapons first, thats the easy part.

-Make a working npc with animations

this is are only problem. yes we can make the actual npc but how to add anims i have no idea because i can only do so much in rsposer. if anyone knows how to animate npc&#39;s we would greatly appreciate you either joining the project or showing us how it works.
pm me if your interested.

well thats mostly it for this month. the maps are just gunna take up the most time we are gunna try to make them as perfect as we can and to do this it takes time. well thanks guys leave opinions of our project below.

also once i finish the first island i will post pictures. so ya&#39;ll can tell me what you think

November:

ok project was a lil delayed since i was grounded but this past weekend i made the first house with a door  theres only one problem lots of spots will be unwalkable like around buildings and stuff but it doesnt really affect the game that much i still think once im finished it will be a nice turn out. ill post pics sometime just been busy



GOT ALOT DONE THIS WEEK HERES VID :D!!!

<p>Well, since I can’t seem to find any exact numbers I’m going to guess they’ll have around 100ish programmers working on runescape seeing as it’s their biggest game. If a handful of self-taught programmers and college students can recreate that then that’s still a good achievement. You can’t deny that what they’ve created is a great success.</p>

              <p>Yeah but you’re being extremely closed minded towards what they’ve accomplished. There aren’t millions of servers that are exactly like rs, there’s less than 5 and even then there’s only two I can think that are really close. Like I said, if less than 10 developers can create what thousands of professional programmers were paid to do, then that’s a massive achievement.</p>
<p>Just because they haven’t designed the content theory themselves doesn’t mean that it isn’t something special.</p>
