    <title>Paypal Subscription</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paypal-subscription/323175</link>
    <description>Somebody subscribed to something on paypal, which says they must pay £20 to me annually. I doubt the person actually wants the service they subscribed to anymore because they no longer use it and last used it for a few days in June this year when they first paid for it. However they have not canceled the subscription so I was wondering if they would be given a choice or anything when it comes to June 2010.

What happens when you have to renew a subscription? Is the person sent an email asking them if they wish to pay, or are they just notified that the payment has been taken automatically? What happens if they don&#39;t have enough money in their account?

[code]
2* Jun 2009 	  	Payment			From	******	Completed 
2* Jun 2009 	  	Subscription Creation	From	******	Active
[/code]

Then when I click on the one that says active:
[code]
Active
      Subscriptions: You have automatic payments scheduled for this subscription.
[/code]

So do I have a chance at getting phree gps?</description>

It is reoccurring, I wrote the other side of situation by accident - just reverse what I said.</p>
