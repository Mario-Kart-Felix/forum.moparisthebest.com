    <title>Datmaker 1.41 and model help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/datmaker-1-41-and-model-help/390632</link>
    <description>I have scaled and inserted several new items into my 508 including torva chaotic ect. My only issue is that I am using datmaker 1.37c and I can&#39;t load alot of objects. I can&#39;t load pernix legs or ceremonial robe top ect. I would really like to be able to get them into the server. I tried loading the model directly on the client and it turned me invis even with a number under 15000. I tried forcing it to convert to mqo and then meta wouldnt load it. Could someone please help me or give me a link to the newest datmaker 1.41+.
