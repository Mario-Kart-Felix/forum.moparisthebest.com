    <description>[center]*BEFORE READING, PLEASE ACT MATURE ABOUT THIS*[/center]


I stumbled upon a website about nudist. On this website they have all sorts of pictures of people just living life naked, seems like no big deal. BUT I stumbled upon multiple pictures of children that look to be about 5-16. Completly naked and open. 

IMO I find this to be under the category of child pornagraphy and think it should be taken off. Whats yours?



Im not sure if Im allowed to post the link but if a moderator ends up on this thread the anwser to that would be apreciated.</description>

              <p>Okay so first off let me say I can see everybodys opinion and why they would look at it that way. Being a nudist is a life style. If people want to walk around naked, let them. But Personally, nudist or not, I believe it is wrong for ANY child under the age of 18 (and I live in the USA) to be photographed/ Videotaped nude. It’s just plain wrong in my opinion. No child should be put into that light… but there are some sickos out there whod rather fap to a 9 year old girl instead of girls their own age… its just sickening, I couldn’t imagine being the father of a younger girl or boy, and get online and see pictures of my children naked and such.</p>

<p>we will start with the legal bs. You tell me what makes someone an adult or a child. You can’t and nobody else can. If you really want to get into it that would involve the maturity level.

<p>You said it yourself - maturity level. Age has no bearing on it. Also, we weren’t specifically talking about adults, we were talking about when a person can make a reasonable decision about their actions, which has <span class="bbcode-b">nothing</span> to do with age at all</p>

<p>Because not wanting to clean my room is exactly the same as not wanting to have naked pictures of me over the internet, isn’t it? And also, please don’t assume what I do and don’t “have” to do. My parents don’t tell me to clean my room because it’s my room and it’s where I keep my things - if it’s untidy then it’s a hinderance to me and no one else.<br>

<p>How does age not have anything to do with when someone can make a decision about their actions? Thats like saying a new born is thinking “Should I take a dump in my pants now or when she changes my diaper?”</p>
<p>Sounds like your parents either don’t care or your a young responsible child who never does any wrong. Congrats!<br>
Obviously cleaning your room and nude pictures aren’t the same, its an example genius.</p>
<p>Your straying way off track now causing me to do the same so im going to put us back on.[/quote]</p>
<p>Because your age doesn’t, your maturity does. An example of this can be seen as children have different ages when they become toilet trained, because it is decided by their maturity and intelligence rather than their age.</p>
<p>I’m 16 years old, my parents will help me if I ask for help but I have my own job and I earn my own money which I buy the majority of my own things with. The reason they don’t care about my room is because it doesn’t affect them - if I clean my room it will help me but if I don’t clean my room it won’t harm them, much like if I don’t fold my clothes, it doesn’t harm them it only harms me.</p>
<p>I’m not going off track, I am addressing the things you say because you are saying that children of an intelligent and mature age are unable to distance themselves from their parents lifetime if they are “under 17”, because unlike “where I live”, the USA is different.</p>

              <p>One thing people need to understand that the nudist lifestyle is perfectly sound — if everyone involved feels the same way. These kids may think that being naked is nothing, which is why they probably don’t care if they are filmed or photographed. Nobody will argue with that. So whether or not these kids are ‘willing’ or old enough to make their own choices isn’t really the problem. Fact is, even if they were old enough, they still wouldn’t care. The problem comes when you expose them to the rest of the world. Not everyone is raised nudist, we are raised quite the opposite, learning that seeing someone naked is extremely personal and not for everyone to see. So when this company (yes, I call it a company, it exists to make money) exposes these innocent people (including some of the adults, if they were raised nudist) to people that were not raised the same way, you have a problem. The company takes advantage of the difference in culture to expose the people to others that do not view nudism the same way. Frankly I think it should be illegal.</p>

I was attempting to point it towards the younger kids. When I said they CANNOT I didn’t mean legally. I meant they had no choice. They can’t do anything about anything. They can’t live/survive without their parents decisions. They don’t know that what they are doing can be viewed as wrong nor will they know until they are a year or 2 younger then you.</p>
<p>I can imagine that if a 16-17 year old said they didnt want to do it their parents would probably let them stay home or go to a friends. Than again, there are other parents who would force them to do it because they are under 18, they live under their house, they have to follow their rules.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Then why did you say “in the USA”? Why did you say “under 17” as if it is a solid barrier between adulthood and childhood?[/quote]</p>
<p>Because I live in the USA, and there is a solid barrier. under 18 you are considered a minor and 18 + you are considered an adult. You can’t go into and “Adult” store unless you are 18 + you can’t go into a bar unless you are 18 + (can’t drink until you are 21+) can’t buy cigs until you are 18 + the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Next?</p>
