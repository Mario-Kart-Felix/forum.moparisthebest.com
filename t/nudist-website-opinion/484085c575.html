<p>Ok, whats a 4 year old going to do about it? What is a 4 year old’s recourse if he/she doesn’t want nude HD videos being sold to pedofiles online? Even when he/she becomes 18, what will they do? These pictures and hd videos will be around forever, and as long as they are making money from pedofiles, they will continue selling them.</p>
<p>And like david said, this is NOT expressing beliefs, this is selling hd nude videos of children for a monthly subscription fee.</p>
<p>I love how I can’t smoke pot without going to jail, but I could start a camp for nude children to come and get their pictures and videos taken, so I can sell them on the internet.</p>

<p>Where he made it out as if it is some kind of US law that people under the age of 17 must legally do whatever their parents want. This is because he said “if their parents say they cannot”, a 4 year old child would not know what is happening so their parents wouldn’t have an opinion on them “opting out” because they wouldn’t care about it in the first place - it would be normal for them. However, he said that they “can’t opt out if their parents say they cannot”, which shows that he is clearly talking about children who are older than 4 (I appreciate your point although it would be nice if you could pose it in a way that doesn’t involve twisting what I said), children who are old enough and intelligent enough to <span class="bbcode-b">want</span> to opt out but are prevented by their parents.</p>

<p>If you read what I was talking about you would understand I really wasnt talking about people your age. I was attempting to point it towards the younger kids. When I said they CANNOT I didn’t mean legally. I meant they had no choice. They can’t do anything about anything. They can’t live/survive without their parents decisions. They don’t know that what they are doing can be viewed as wrong nor will they know until they are a year or 2 younger then you.</p>
<p>I can imagine that if a 16-17 year old said they didnt want to do it their parents would probably let them stay home or go to a friends. Than again, there are other parents who would force them to do it because they are under 18, they live under their house, they have to follow their rules.</p>

<p>Then why did you say “in the USA”? Why did you say “under 17” as if it is a solid barrier between adulthood and childhood?</p>

<p>Because I live in the USA, and there is a solid barrier. under 18 you are considered a minor and 18 + you are considered an adult. You can’t go into and “Adult” store unless you are 18 + you can’t go into a bar unless you are 18 + (can’t drink until you are 21+) can’t buy cigs until you are 18 + the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>The point is that these videos should not be for sale, the kids should not be on camera.

        <p>One thing people need to understand that the nudist lifestyle is perfectly sound — if everyone involved feels the same way. These kids may think that being naked is nothing, which is why they probably don’t care if they are filmed or photographed. Nobody will argue with that. So whether or not these kids are ‘willing’ or old enough to make their own choices isn’t really the problem. Fact is, even if they were old enough, they still wouldn’t care. The problem comes when you expose them to the rest of the world. Not everyone is raised nudist, we are raised quite the opposite, learning that seeing someone naked is extremely personal and not for everyone to see. So when this company (yes, I call it a company, it exists to make money) exposes these innocent people (including some of the adults, if they were raised nudist) to people that were not raised the same way, you have a problem. The company takes advantage of the difference in culture to expose the people to others that do not view nudism the same way. Frankly I think it should be illegal.</p>

<p>You make yourself look retarded enough by your almost illegible sentences, I don’t need to do anything to make you look retarded.</p>
<p>Also, note how earlier I said that the way you said “under 17” made it sound like you were talking about legality. You denied this and said that the law didn’t come into it, yet the only example you can provide of the age 17/18 being a barrier is in legal terms? I’m not ignoring what I say and I’m not ignoring what you say - you, clearly, are doing both.</p>
<p>You said that any child under the age of 18 can’t “opt out” of anything unless their parents are okay with it, and then you said that this is because children are too young - if they are too young to understand that they are being exploited, they wouldn’t have any reason to want to opt out of it and so their parents’ opinion on it would not come into the issue.</p>

<p>we will start with the legal bs. You tell me what makes someone an adult or a child. You can’t and nobody else can. If you really want to get into it that would involve the maturity level. So the only other way to tell the difference between the 2 is by their age and what you can and cannot do at that age.</p>
<p>If your parents told you to clean your room and you say no then your just disobedient. It does not matter how old you are. If you are under 18 and your parents tell you to do something you have to. Idgaf if you think your a badass and and you can tell your mommy or daddy no. You have to.</p>

<p>How does age not have anything to do with when someone can make a decision about their actions? Thats like saying a new born is thinking “Should I take a dump in my pants now or when she changes my diaper?”</p>
<p>Sounds like your parents either don’t care or your a young responsible child who never does any wrong. Congrats!<br>
Obviously cleaning your room and nude pictures aren’t the same, its an example genius.</p>
<p>Your straying way off track now causing me to do the same so im going to put us back on. Selling naked pictures of children(nudist or not) is wrong.</p>

<p>Because your age doesn’t, your maturity does. An example of this can be seen as children have different ages when they become toilet trained, because it is decided by their maturity and intelligence rather than their age.</p>
<p>I’m 16 years old, my parents will help me if I ask for help but I have my own job and I earn my own money which I buy the majority of my own things with. The reason they don’t care about my room is because it doesn’t affect them - if I clean my room it will help me but if I don’t clean my room it won’t harm them, much like if I don’t fold my clothes, it doesn’t harm them it only harms me.</p>
<p>I’m not going off track, I am addressing the things you say because you are saying that children of an intelligent and mature age are unable to distance themselves from their parents lifetime if they are “under 17”, because unlike “where I live”, the USA is different.</p>

        <p>Okay so first off let me say I can see everybodys opinion and why they would look at it that way. Being a nudist is a life style. If people want to walk around naked, let them. But Personally, nudist or not, I believe it is wrong for ANY child under the age of 18 (and I live in the USA) to be photographed/ Videotaped nude. It’s just plain wrong in my opinion. No child should be put into that light… but there are some sickos out there whod rather fap to a 9 year old girl instead of girls their own age… its just sickening, I couldn’t imagine being the father of a younger girl or boy, and get online and see pictures of my children naked and such.</p>
