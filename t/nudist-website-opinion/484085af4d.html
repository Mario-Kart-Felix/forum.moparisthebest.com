THAT would be harming her, because she would be tied up and blind-folded. Just taking a picture of someone naked is completely different. In fact, it’s the exact same thing as taking a normal picture of anyone, except they have no clothes. What is honestly wrong with “private parts” being exposed and someone taking a slightly higher interest in them than usual? Nothing.</p>

I hope to fking god you are kidding. Coming from someone with your reputation and brains scares the shit out of me.</p>
<p>Lets tie up your gf and have all the men on mopar get off on her. It’s not like she is taking any REAL physical damage. We will even blind fold her so she doesnt know what is going on.<br>
[/quote]I’m not kidding at all. That goes against what I was saying. THAT would be harming her, because she would be tied up and blind-folded. Just taking a picture of someone naked is completely different. In fact, it’s the exact same thing as taking a normal picture of anyone, except they have no clothes. What is honestly wrong with “private parts” being exposed and someone taking a slightly higher interest in them than usual? Nothing.[/quote]I actually agree with Lin.  Besides, it’s their choice if they want to be publicly exposed or not.</p>

        <p>You all(besdies Lin) are missing the concept. These children have NO idea whats going on. Some do look to be about 16-17 so I imagine they do. Most are under 12 and a lot younger. It may not be doing any physical harm to them now but think of when they are in their 20s. They arent nudist anymore because they didnt like the lifestyle but NOW HD videos of them naked when they were young as hell are online for sale. That could do some mental damage. Especially if the site was to actually produce tons of traffic.</p>

<p>The children are obviously aware of the cameras around, if they were hidden it would be a different story. If the children don’t want to be filmed, I’m sure they could opt-out. Your argument about “mental damage” is stupid and unjustified. If they are brought up in a nudist family, it would be the norm. Just like being brought up (and indoctrinated) with some religion. If they are around people, while naked, their entire lives until they reach a point when they no longer like the life-style, why would they suddenly obtain “mental damage” because people can watch them online in videos living their NORMAL lives? You also make it sound like they are completely oblivious to the fact that they are being filmed, and will one day be shocked to discover their videos online.[/quote]</p>
<p>Im not sure where you live but people 17 and under in the USA cannot “opt-out” if theyre parents say they cannot.</p>
<p>1.) I doubt they know their photos are online<br>
2.) I doubt they know that HD films of them are being sold.( theyre naked bodies are being sold for money) &lt;- and if that doesnt make you cring knowing an 8 year old naked male/female’s body is being made into profit then your fked.</p>
<p>Im not saying that being a nudist isnt normal because it is as normal as someone playing football. None of you have read the topic. This is about how the pictures were shot. Until you read it your arguement is invalid. Quit being ignorant and jumping in the debate if you have no idea what your going on about.</p>

<p>1.) I doubt they know their photos are online<br>

<p>Im not saying that being a nudist isnt normal because it is as normal as someone playing football. None of you have read the topic. This is about how the pictures were shot.

Why? Does the US allow child abuse? “Take your clothes off we’re going on a walk” “No I don’t want to be a nudist anymore” “Okay”<br>

<p>Moat parents are more sane. What are the children going to do? Call the police?[/quote]</p>
<p>“More sane”? What are you talking about? He said that children can opt out of the nudist lifestyle and you said that “legally they can’t” - there’s no laws against leaving a lifestyle</p>

I’m below 17. It’s already been said that those children are below 17. Did I say “throw a fit in their room”? Because I don’t remember saying it, I said that they could refuse.</p>
