    <description>I have this plugin called mmSupernaturals, and want it to work with magic wands.

when the user joins a group such as Angel I want them to be able to use a command that lets them join a group in groupmanager that makes sure they are an angel, etc etc for every other group. I would like this so I can add certain wands and spells to each supernatural. Please help!</description>
