    <title>Open an image with size relative to screen size</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/open-an-image-with-size-relative-to-screen-size/317883</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m making my professional web site, and I&#39;m going to have all my work on it.

Videos, easy.

Images. A task.

Basically, I&#39;m going to have thumbnails on the right side, and when you click one it&#39;ll bring that image to the body section. But I want the images more hi-res than that. So after making it move to the body section and be bigger, I&#39;m also having the option to click it to open a new window with the full res image in that.

So after you click the bigger image it does the lightbox kinda thing where it opens it with javascript.

But here&#39;s a question. People have different screen sizes. The images will be quite big, ranging from 1280x720 to 1900x1080. If someone has a small resolution, I don&#39;t want to open that full res image all the way. I&#39;d like it to open to it&#39;s size, unless it&#39;s size is larger or equal to their current resolution. If it is larger or equal to, then only open the image to 80% of their browser window or screen.

How hard would it be to make that image popup size relative to their size? I know I can use percentages instead of pixels.

The problem with that is if the image is smaller than their resolution, it enlarges it. And I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d do that with javascript or CSS.

I know a bit of HTML and CSS, but the only javascript I know is looking through Lightbox.</description>

              <p>I really just want to edit the Lightbox code so that the image that pops up is either full size if the screen allows it, or a percentage of the screen size if it’s too big.</p>
<p>I’ll look at those.</p>

<p>Also, wouldn’t it be better to judge the size of the displayed image by the users browser viewport size and not screen resolution?</p>
<p>EDIT: Added a better article for image size.</p>
