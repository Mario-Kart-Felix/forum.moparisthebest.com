    <title>HELP: Servers not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-servers-not-working/121534</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t have any idea what the problem is. Whenever I try to play on a Mopar server, I get this little red X in the corner. I tried updating Java, then I tried messing around with the internet connection, I tried to use the client, but nothing is working. Did anyone else have this problem and got it fixed?</description>
