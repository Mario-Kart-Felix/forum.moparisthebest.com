    <title>[PI] Buy 50/Buy X</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-buy-50-buy-x/446373</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t find anything in the client which allows me to edit the Buy options, players on my server are sick of having to click &quot;Buy 10&quot; over and over.

I have Notepad++ and I searched through my whole client folder for &quot;Buy 10&quot; but nothing came up.

Any ideas?</description>
