    <title>Help putting up personal Web client - not a noob</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-putting-up-personal-web-client-not-a-noob/539701</link>
    <description>hello gentlemen,
I have much experience with moparscape server compilation and content, and I have worked with many machine hosted servers and clients. I have always wanted to make my server have a web client like the main server [moparscape3.php]. so I decided to throw up a new page on my webserver, the html contains a simple applet launching code &lt;applet name=webclient-test width=505 height=345 archive=&#39;experiemental/moparscape/web.jar&#39; code=&#39;org.rscdaemon.client.mudclient.class&#39; mayscript&gt;&lt;/applet&gt;
I have personally signed jarfile web.jar, so signing should not be a problem. when I attempt to load I recieve Classnotfoundexeption error message: org.rscdaemon.client.mudclient.class
this should not be happening, im staring at mudclient.class now. however, I am currently operating on about 2 hours of sleep, so if the problem is flamingly simple pardon my ignorance  :P
Thank you for reading

also- current host is Windows- my normal environment is Linux, but i am certain windows is properly configured despite windows inexperience- it could be because I need to somehow integrate apache ant into my server. im fairly sure that thats dependent on clientside- not serverside apache ant.
server is mongoose win64</description>
