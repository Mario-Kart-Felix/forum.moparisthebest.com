    <title>[REQ] Website logo</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-website-logo/413329</link>
    <description>Hi there, I was wanting a banner for my website and i really suck on photoshop.
So if anyone here has photoshop i was wondering if you could make me a cool background with &quot;PanellaX&quot; in the center.

PanellaX text details:
Font: I would like Junegull . can be found at http://www.1001freefonts.com/rounded-fonts.php . should be 12th down.

If you have photoshop, make it have gradient overlay pretty strong with the colors
sandy brown and white.
Make it so its small inner and out glow

If anyone could do this for me i would be so happy. thanks
( sorry for my bad english)</description>
