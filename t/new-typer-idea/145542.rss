    <title>New Typer idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-typer-idea/145542</link>
    <description>Ok... I have an Idea for a Typing Program...
It&#39;s not [i]exactly[/i] an autotyper, but it has
a few boxes that you type in:
1. What you&#39;re buying/selling,
2. How much you are buyin/sellin it for,
3. your &quot;thanx&quot;, &quot;tyvm&quot;, &quot;thx dood&quot; (thank-you message)
with a few radio buttons for the text color and/or effects.

Technaclly it is suppost to be a form made with the versions
of SCAR that support them (I have V. 3.11),
and all you press is Enter, or if you don&#39;t wanna type or press enter, it auto&#39;s for you
so all you have to do is see if sum1 trades. ( With the Up-dated runescape, you may wanna
have it accept the trade by clicking on the purple text or pressing the &quot;trade&#39;s&quot; button at the
near-bottom right next to the report-abuse button)
If Any1 wants to try sumthin like that, go for it.

Basicly all it has is a few textboxes to type you&#39;re info,
radio buttons for colors(glow3,flash2) and effects(slide,shake)
and a checkbox that if checked, it automaticly types,
and [b]Make sure it mispells the words!!![/b] except the price of course! :D</description>
