    <title>HTTPS support for avatars</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/https-support-for-avatars/539813</link>
    <description>sup lads, was just wondering if we could have https support for avatars so that those of us browsing using ssl don&#39;t get the insecure warning. imgur supports ssl but when it tried using the https url in my profile it wouldn&#39;t save.

I&#39;m pretty sure it can be done by using // at the start of the URL and it&#39;ll use either http or https depending on the connection of the page. I guess it doesn&#39;t matter if some people don&#39;t use hosts that support ssl because then at least the warning will only happen on a few pages.

So yeah.. allowing https:// or just // should fix the problem! Thanks for reading boys.</description>

              <p>I noticed this problem too, I’m probably just going to force people to upload avatars to my server so it can always be served with https.</p>
<p>edit:<br>
I’ve removed all avatars, and made it so you must upload an avatar, it will speed things up along with being served over the correct channel.</p>
