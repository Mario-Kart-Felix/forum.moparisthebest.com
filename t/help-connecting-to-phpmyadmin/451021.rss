    <title>Help Connecting to Phpmyadmin</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-connecting-to-phpmyadmin/451021</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using the RSCAngel source. I haven&#39;t opened my rsc client for a few months and decided to try it out again. For some reason, after I started wamp server, I could not open phpmyadmin or localhost.. it just says unable to connect. Anyone know how I can connect to it?</description>
