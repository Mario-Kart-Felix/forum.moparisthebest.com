    <description>Hey im X Cubba X. I used to always make my name OMG its NICK but i stopped a short while ago. On my server when you log in all the portals are visable. Everything is there. But, when you go through a portal to the main portal room or just to another area, the other portals are gone so your almost stuck. If you wait they dont appear. I need help. Also if you log out and back in they are there untill you go through another portal.. Any help?</description>
