    <description>I would like everyone to take a look at the following sentence and post a reply saying how many F&#39;s there are in the sentence:

[hr]
FINISHED FILES ARE THE RE
SULT OF YEARS OF SCIENTI
FIC STUDY COMBINED WITH
THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS.
[hr]

This is not a trick in any way.</description>

<p>@ eyeownyew - I was checking to see if anyone was able to legitimately count the total number of F’s, which in fact determines if someone is a genius or not – without the use of notepad++ of course .  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Eh? It actually determines if someone is a genius?  Odd <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>

Yes, people that are considered ‘geniuses’ are able to access a greater amount of their brains, when commonly only up to 20% is accessed by humans.[/quote]</p>
<p>This isn’t true and there is absolutely no proof</p>
<p>We use our whole brain. I did like that movie though <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I understand that a person’s IQ doesn’t mean anything when it comes to intelligence, however this brings us back to the brain activity of a person. I’m no guru at the study of the brain, nor the entire body for that matter, but I can strongly say that the amount of access a person has to their brain affects the output of every single action a person executes.</p>

Brains can also be applied in different areas. Just because someone has an IQ of 150 doesn’t mean they are smart – they may be ‘mentally retarded’ when it comes to previously learned knowledge, but they could learn quickly.<br>
Brains are odd.[/quote]<br>
Exactly my point, just didn’t want to go into too much depth as I’m lazy ;p.</p>

Brains can also be applied in different areas. Just because someone has an IQ of 150 doesn’t mean they are smart – they may be ‘mentally retarded’ when it comes to previously learned knowledge, but they could learn quickly.<br>
Brains are odd.</p>

Yes, people that are considered ‘geniuses’ are able to access a greater amount of their brains, when commonly only up to 20% is accessed by humans. The movie ‘Limitless’ shows the effects that occur once a guy uses a medicinal method of increasing brain activity, which doesn’t increase your intelligence, but improves the concentration a human can have. We all are able to possess the same knowledge, but the problem is how we can go about obtaining that knowledge.</p>
