    <description>Ok, me and my friend need help over team viewer.   The computer you will be working with will be his computer and I will give you details on his Teamviewer ID and Password for connection.  I will post some details below that will help you with portfowarding and making it so we can host players and so they can connect.

Current Router: Linksys [CISCO]

Picture of the router:

Router Number: wrt120n

We are using No-Ip.  If you need any other further information post below and we would really like the help to get this server up.  Thanks!  :)</description>
