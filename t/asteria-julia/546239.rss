    <description>[center][size=24pt][b]Julia[/b][/size][/center]


[size=16pt][b]Introduction:[/b][/size]
[b]About the previous Julia:[/b]
Some might have passed by Julia, the server for beginners I made.
That was more of an experiment that in the end turned out pretty good.
Though it was still buggy, mainly due to the shitty deathlypvpz base I used.

[b]About this julia version:[/b]
This time I&#39;m basing on Asteria which is in my opinion a pretty decent base, and I&#39;m sure many will agree with that.

Don&#39;t expect just a remake on a different base, this is going to be a much more advanced version.
While the other version was buggy and was still not simple enough for real beginners (based on my inbox),
that will not be the case in this version.
While code was also just reworked to fit with the system but shitty as fudge, I will not let that happen with this version.
I will do my best on writing decent code, and keep Asteria in honor.

[b]So what do you mean with more advanced?[/b]
First of all, ability to edit more stuff and customize the base much more to the user&#39;s likings.
Second, a lot better client support.
And third, possibility for community input by an addon/patch system.
An example would be, that I have a few default themes for the panels, and people could create an own theme which
then can easily be installed by others.



[size=16pt][b]Progress:[/b][/size]
I wont go for the &quot;green is finished, ...&quot; stuff but just add what is DONE with a piece of media.

[size=14pt][b]Client sided[/b][/size]
[spoiler=View client progress]
First of all, before anything else launches the properties are loaded.
This way we know the last theme the user used and his server name.
e.g. The control panel will say &quot;TheServerName - Control Panel&quot;

The control panel of the client which gives the ability to modify.. probably everything somebody wants to modify in a client.
As you can see there&#39;s also support for distributing, zipping the cache and jarring the client.
You can also toggle whether flames should be shown on the client login screen or not.

Choosing a new client background works via a file chooser dialog.
Size doesn&#39;t matter! As the image is scaled upon loading the client.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/4U3vavA.png[/img]

The distribution folder where distributions are written to.
The jar and zipped cache will automatically be named to the server name that is used.
So it&#39;s not always Julia and Julia_cache but the choosen server name.

The cache downloader.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/l5g9G5G.png[/img]

An example of a different theme being used and the changed background.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/ZDSnUbk.png[/img]

And here&#39;s the loaded client itself, the background image is automatically scaled.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/S6RTFiG.png[/img]

[i]Unless somebody gives me a good idea, the client is pretty much finished.[/i]
[/li][/ul]

Crowns importing.
Any image can be used as it will [B]automatically[/B] rescale when [B]written[/B] to the cache folder.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/NmvKfG2.png[/img]

Rights editor, add your own custom rights with their importance.
You can assign a crown from the imported crowns to rights in case you want to.
considered player means that e.g. a moderator can play like normal players but an admin
would not be considered a player and can&#39;t trade etc...

This version is based on asteria instead of shitty deathlypvpz. Also<br>
I will work on content as well as this is the clean asteria 2.0 base.<br>
The gui’s are not just bells and whistles as the point of the Julia projects is to offer users the possibility<br>
to customize the server to their likings without touching a single line of actual code.</p>

My only problem with this is “your target public” seems to be the ones who assume that RS Private Servers are like many other game servers, where you get the source, you change some parameters, maybe if you’re good you add a few custom aspects, and then you’re good to go. It seems that’s what you’re trying to do with this source. I’m just not sure if this is a good solution to the problems we have now-a-days. I believe that these servers should be here to help teach others development, not just host to gain money and e-peen. That’s all my opinion of course.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not everybody that comes here is interested in developing. The first time I came here I just wanted a ready server to play with some friends.<br>
Eventually I became interested in developing and turn out to really love programming, and here I am with a project for the ones that did not turn out that way.</p>
<p>The thing is with the ones going for the money is that they now just download a server and host it.<br>
My project is not going to change that, in the best case there will not be 10 duplicates of the same server, but a few that look somewhat different because<br>
they used Julia. I can only see that as an improvement, whether they make money of it or not. On that with using Asteria the quality will also be better.</p>

<p>[size=16pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Introduction:</span>[/size]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">About the previous Julia:</span><br>
Some might have passed by Julia, the server for beginners I made.<br>
That was more of an experiment that in the end turned out pretty good.<br>
Though it was still buggy, mainly due to the shitty deathlypvpz base I used.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">About this julia version:</span><br>
This time I’m basing on Asteria which is in my opinion a pretty decent base, and I’m sure many will agree with that.</p>
<p>Don’t expect just a remake on a different base, this is going to be a much more advanced version.<br>
While the other version was buggy and was still not simple enough for real beginners (based on my inbox),<br>
that will not be the case in this version.<br>
While code was also just reworked to fit with the system but shitty as fudge, I will not let that happen with this version.<br>
I will do my best on writing decent code, and keep Asteria in honor.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">So what do you mean with more advanced?</span><br>
First of all, ability to edit more stuff and customize the base much more to the user’s likings.<br>
Second, a lot better client support.<br>
And third, possibility for community input by an addon/patch system.<br>
An example would be, that I have a few default themes for the panels, and people could create an own theme which<br>
then can easily be installed by others.</p>
<p>[size=16pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Progress:</span>[/size]<br>
I wont go for the “green is finished, …” stuff but just add what is DONE with a piece of media.</p>
<p>[ul][li]<br>
[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Client sided</span>[/size]<br>
[spoiler=View client progress]<br>
First of all, before anything else launches the properties are loaded.<br>
This way we know the last theme the user used and his server name.<br>
e.g. The control panel will say “TheServerName - Control Panel”</p>
<p>The control panel of the client which gives the ability to modify… probably everything somebody wants to modify in a client.<br>
As you can see there’s also support for distributing, zipping the cache and jarring the client.<br>
You can also toggle whether flames should be shown on the client login screen or not.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/65lMZmg.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Choosing a new client background works via a file chooser dialog.<br>
Size doesn’t matter! As the image is scaled upon loading the client.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/4U3vavA.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The distribution folder where distributions are written to.<br>
The jar and zipped cache will automatically be named to the server name that is used.<br>
So it’s not always Julia and Julia_cache but the choosen server name.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/lRia11U.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The cache downloader.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/l5g9G5G.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>An example of a different theme being used and the changed background.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZDSnUbk.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>And here’s the loaded client itself, the background image is automatically scaled.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/S6RTFiG.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Unless somebody gives me a good idea, the client is pretty much finished.</span><br>

<p>[/spoiler]</p>
<p>[ul][li]<br>
[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Server sided</span>[/size]<br>
[spoiler=View server progress]</p>
<p>Crowns importing.<br>
Any image can be used as it will [B]automatically[/B] rescale when [B]written[/B] to the cache folder.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/NmvKfG2.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Rights editor, add your own custom rights with their importance.<br>
You can assign a crown from the imported crowns to rights in case you want to.<br>
considered player means that e.g. a moderator can play like normal players but an admin<br>
would not be considered a player and can’t trade etc…<br>
