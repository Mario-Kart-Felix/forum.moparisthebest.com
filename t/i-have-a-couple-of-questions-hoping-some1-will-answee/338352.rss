              <p>Alright, for the donator their’s a .java or .txt you also add their name to, along with changing it from “0” to “1” in their charater file.</p>
<p>For co-owner change their rights to 3 in their charater rights.</p>
<p>To change a wepon/armour to a differnert equaipment solt its in items.java.</p>
<p>The model thing, theirs usally more than 1 model for a item, also try to reload your client when you have done the “add model 'model number”</p>
<p>Hope this has helped.</p>
