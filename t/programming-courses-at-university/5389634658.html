<p>It seems like the term “Computer Graphics” also refers to image processing.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>Computer graphics is a sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Although the term often refers to the study of three-dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and image processing.</blockquote>

<p>Now you might argue that you shouldn’t quote Wikipedia. But, what’s written there is correct the most of the time.</p>
<p>Edit: By the way, filtering is also part of realtime rendering. For instance, in texture mapping, bilinerar interpolation and bilinear filtering is the same thing.</p>

<p>Alright then. I stand by what I said in the absurdity that computer graphics “has nothing to do with” game development, though. Tons of graphics hardware is progressed specifically because of game development and non-realtime rendering.</p>

<p>I never said that computer graphics has anything to do with game development. But, game developers sometimes (or oftentimes) use computer graphics to accomplish their goals. That’s a totally different thing.</p>

        <p>To get those Higher level courses you will need to attend a 4-year rather than a 2-year college. Not many community colleges offer such courses. Odds are the first class your taking is Introduction to programming (a level 100 course) and next is a 200. 200 will get you into Some things like GUI’s and other simple graphical things. Ours we made Pong, and are working on O(n) for sorting techniques. odds are had you done some basic programming before, you could of skipped your level 100 course by going to the professor and explaining you already know the basics.

<p>If this was aimed at me, this is pretty much what it’s like now. We write a simple system and have to do a write up of it. The typical degree is the 3 year, which is probably the first year being introductory as they teach it from the ground up and then progresses in the second and third year. There is another option which allows for a 4th year, which would be a placement year with a games dev company, so I might take this option. Was suggested before it’s good for experience.</p>

To get those Higher level courses you will need to attend a 4-year rather than a 2-year college. Not many community colleges offer such courses. Odds are the first class your taking is Introduction to programming (a level 100 course) and next is a 200. 200 will get you into Some things like GUI’s and other simple graphical things. Ours we made Pong, and are working on O(n) for sorting techniques. odds are had you done some basic programming before, you could of skipped your level 100 course by going to the professor and explaining you already know the basics. They would probably have you write a simple program, or have you explain a bit of code to them.<br>

<p>If this was aimed at me, this is pretty much what it’s like now. We write a simple system and have to do a write up of it. The typical degree is the 3 year, which is probably the first year being introductory as they teach it from the ground up and then progresses in the second and third year. There is another option which allows for a 4th year, which would be a placement year with a games dev company, so I might take this option. Was suggested before it’s good for experience.[/quote]</p>
<p>I also suggest you keep a solo game project in development all through your college years. You never know if you game will blossom into some multi-million dollar game idea, like Mojang’s Minecraft.  or Banished(unknown creator). Banished was entirely written by one person in a basement, except for the music.</p>
