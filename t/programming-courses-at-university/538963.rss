    <title>Programming courses at university</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/programming-courses-at-university/538963</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking at the programming courses that I can take at university, and there are two in particular I want to go for, and after reading the course overview, I&#39;m still not sure as to which one I want to go into and would appreciate some information if anyone has anything to share. The two courses I&#39;m looking at is Computer science, and Computer games programming.

I&#39;m currently taking a computing course at college, but it&#39;s nowhere near what I want to do. The programming is at an extremely basic level, with iteration being the most &quot;complex&quot; task and on top of this, its main focus is on the theory work, which makes up the 3 hour exam which I absolutely hate.

I&#39;m interested in games programming, AI etc and this really interests me as this is what I&#39;ve always wanted to do but I&#39;ve been given advice to take computer science to understand programming more. The problem with this course is the fact that it uses different languages as I believe they&#39;re better for games programming, direct x etc, so it&#39;s going to be using c++ and I&#39;ve never even touched that language.

I just want to focus on the programming to be honest, gain new skills, get more fluent and that&#39;s what I enjoy, but if Computer Science contains all of the theory work, like user requirements, system design, testing and development etc (Writing up...) then I really don&#39;t want to take it, even if the course does focus on Java as it&#39;s main language.

Any advice on the two courses? (Sorry if this is the wrong section)</description>

To get those Higher level courses you will need to attend a 4-year rather than a 2-year college. Not many community colleges offer such courses. Odds are the first class your taking is Introduction to programming (a level 100 course) and next is a 200. 200 will get you into Some things like GUI’s and other simple graphical things. Ours we made Pong, and are working on O(n) for sorting techniques. odds are had you done some basic programming before, you could of skipped your level 100 course by going to the professor and explaining you already know the basics. They would probably have you write a simple program, or have you explain a bit of code to them.<br>

<p>If this was aimed at me, this is pretty much what it’s like now. We write a simple system and have to do a write up of it. The typical degree is the 3 year, which is probably the first year being introductory as they teach it from the ground up and then progresses in the second and third year. There is another option which allows for a 4th year, which would be a placement year with a games dev company, so I might take this option. Was suggested before it’s good for experience.[/quote]</p>
<p>I also suggest you keep a solo game project in development all through your college years. You never know if you game will blossom into some multi-million dollar game idea, like Mojang’s Minecraft.  or Banished(unknown creator). Banished was entirely written by one person in a basement, except for the music.</p>

<p>Alright then. I stand by what I said in the absurdity that computer graphics “has nothing to do with” game development, though. Tons of graphics hardware is progressed specifically because of game development and non-realtime rendering.</p>

Computer science, at least in Australia, covers quite a large amount of low-level computing (I’m talking embedded systems such as robotics and machinery controllers, among other things). At least at my university it also involved things like computer graphics, AI, security, etc. Plus there’s the maths component, which is quite important.</p>
<p>I did IT instead of computer science but, frankly, I wish I did computer science and just worked hard to get through the maths.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not if that’s what you want to do. Some schools that specialize in Computer Science, e.g. DigiPen, focus on this:</p>

<p>I never got a real CS degree (i also never took a game development course), and yet I have worked as a game developer (at the same project as Jeb). My CV was what mattered for me, though. That, and being extremely passionate about what you do, will get you a long way. Just because you have a degree usually doesn’t mean that much, which a lot of people seems to think. It may help you get further in the selection process. But once you’re one of the few selected, you have to stand out, by showing off what you have done in your spare time. <span class="bbcode-b">The closer your projects are to what they are looking for, the better chance you will have.</span></p>

</aside>
<p>Schools that force you to do game projects and learn how to work with people are excellent for helping to get into the game industry. They also work really, really well to get into any other industry, too. Now a school that just slaps a few graphics classes onto a CS degree and calls that game programming, that’s completely absurd. That’s not how we do things.</p>

<p>If you’re serious you should intern at the company that you’re interested in (while going to college if you can) You may be the coffee runner for a few months but it’s a great way to get connections. I did an intern at Dreamworks and it was a great opportunity to realize that was the path I did not want to take but also hooked me up with connections.</p>

<p>I agree with this. Internships are a really great way to build professional experience and expand your professional network. Consider creating a linked in profile; they’re more useful than you’d think.</p>

Computer science, at least in Australia, covers quite a large amount of low-level computing (I’m talking embedded systems such as robotics and machinery controllers, among other things). At least at my university it also involved things like computer graphics, AI, security, etc. Plus there’s the maths component, which is quite important.</p>
<p>I did IT instead of computer science but, frankly, I wish I did computer science and just worked hard to get through the maths.</p>

              <p>I never got a real CS degree (i also never took a game development course), and yet I have worked as a game developer (at the same project as Jeb). My CV was what mattered for me, though. That, and being extremely passionate about what you do, will get you a long way. Just because you have a degree usually doesn’t mean that much, which a lot of people seems to think. It may help you get further in the selection process. But once you’re one of the few selected, you have to stand out, by showing off what you have done in your spare time. The closer your projects are to what they are looking for, the better chance you will have.</p>

<p>Most CS degrees offer game programming as a specialist stream anyway.</p>

<p>You must not know any game programmers. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Game programming is part of the CS degree field. Pretty common to switch between the different fields.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: it’s not as simple as going into CS and “specializing in game development.” That’s silly. Game development is an entire industry of development in itself, with a wide variety of job paths. Some parts are extremely difficult if you’re into more cutting edge solutions (this also applies to other fields of CS that big tech companies tend to have to solve), otherwise there’s tools programming in game development which is super similar to general CS. There’s also gameplay programming which is more of what I consider true “game programming,” but that’s neither my interest nor my forte, so I’m not going to discuss it much.</p>
<p>Just take various courses and see what interests you. There are schools and graduate programs that specialize in certain tracks, including game development, AI, graphics programming, networking, systems engineering, etc. The field is absolutely monolithic. Just look around and take a class that’s interesting. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

I’m currently taking a computing course at college, but it’s nowhere near what I want to do. The programming is at an extremely basic level, with iteration being the most “complex” task and on top of this, its main focus is on the theory work, which makes up the 3 hour exam which I absolutely hate.</p>
<p>I just want to focus on the programming to be honest, gain new skills, get more fluent and that’s what I enjoy, but if Computer Science contains all of the theory work, like user requirements, system design, testing and development etc (Writing up…) then I really don’t want to take it, even if the course does focus on Java as it’s main language.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Sounds like you’ve been doing A level computing, or similar, (and if I’m right about that you’re probably on the WJEC board) in which case: this is not what a proper CS course at university will be like. If you go to a good university a CS course will open a lot more doors than just a Games Programming degree, as CS is a much more general field (and mathematical).<br>
In any case, no a CS course will likely contain a lot more than just programming. Also, what you stated as ‘theory’ work is not really computer science theory, it sounds more like some basic software engineering and HCI (which if you are doing the WJEC course is really outdated and useless).[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah it’s a level, and I’ve done both wjec and ocr and with both boards there are ‘theory’ work which I understand gives me a little more knowledge, but it’s kinda useless.</p>
<p>Do the CS courses go in depth with the programming? Because ultimately my goal is do something in relation to gaming, but as many have said, a CS degree will open more doors right?</p>

<p>Thanks for all the feedback[/quote]It’s unlikely to be in depth because there just wouldn’t be enough time in the course. Imo you can easily learn the details in your own time, and as yz says you can still get a game programming job with a CS degree. But obviously if you love game programming and really want to be a game developer then it makes more sense to do a VG course.</p>
