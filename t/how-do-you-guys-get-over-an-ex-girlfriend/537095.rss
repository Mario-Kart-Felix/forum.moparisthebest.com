    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-guys-get-over-an-ex-girlfriend/537095</link>
    <description>Well this girl I been with for a long time decides to leave me for one of my best friends, the problems I have to face is the fact that I will see her everyday and my old best friend... She was my first via sexually and I just feel like trash whenever I see them together. I don&#39;t know what to do at this point.</description>

<p>Make friends with the lonely ones. Break through their shell. You are a programmer (most likely) so you have a good imagination. Use it to word things correctly. Sweep them off their feet and they would be a fool to change their mind. I was my current girlfriends first, and she is stuck like glue (: and always horny… In highschool don’t bother with relationships though. It is always best to wait till college. and don’t rush the gun on sex. If thats all your after, then you are replaceable. If you have emotions involved in your relationships then you should be willing to wait. It is a shame that its was your best friend, but you know he is only after one thing. Just wait around till it falls apart and just be the bigger man.</p>
<p>and just know, someone out there is in the same boat you are. but they have herpes. They got lots lower probability of finding someone new. + the bff has herpes now too. LOL[/quote]<br>

              <p>These things suck man. My girlfriend of 2 years left me, and it was the worst shit in the world. A week after she left me I decided to go out with my friends to a party, and just my luck she was there. She tried to make conversation with me but I just walked off, and 2 hours later she was sitting on some guys lap and kept looking at me. Now normally I’d be like, aight time to clean this motherfucker out, but I thought about it and was like… then I’m stooping to her level.</p>
<p>I just smiled, waved, nodded and carried on like I didn’t care (tho I was dead inside l0l)… but ultimately, me keeping cool and carrying on like I didn’t care was the BEST thing I ever did. Every break up has a winner and a loser, carry on all you want but be prepared to be the loser.</p>

-grab hands(not to long)<br>
-wink at her(not to awkward)<br>
-make faces ( not to creepy or weird)<br>
-say sweet things but in a mean way be like “ewww, your eye’s so cute”<br>
-Play with her hair(tell her that her hair is amazing)<br>
-be funny<br>
-make her laugh<br>
-kiss her on the hand<br>
-kiss her on the cheeks(not the ass cheeks, like the cheeks on the face)</p>
<p><strong><em>HAVE AND ADVENTURE MIND</em></strong><br>
By this i mean, like be open minded to some crazy dirty shit or crazy fun things<br>
Some are like always making her feel like romantic exist but don’t make her fall inlove, keep it in the Friendzone(not bffzone) // like Friends with benefit<br>
But i can’t describe to you adnventure just go outside and find it yourself or think of it…<br>
Anyways …<br>
Just try some of this i guess if you have balls and want to get over your ex…</p>
<p>IF you get rejected just go to another hoe and try again lol<br>
Keep trying till you have a couple of them to talk too and to keep you busy</p>

Boom, you’re now “over” her.</p>
<p>Jokes aside. I still have very faint feelings for the first girl I loved. I got over her with alcohol, and removing all forms of contact with her. While I don’t suggest the same method (at least the alcohol bit). Shit <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> work.</p>

              <p>I’ve had this same situation but I didnt bang her… Anyways the story is that I was dating this girl named Jen and she broke up with me to date my best friend. Everytime I see them in the hall they are making out in my face! I got over this girl by thinking to myself if I was her would I treat him as I wish to be treated? of course not so I thought if she can’t respect me then why should I respect her? Completely ingored her for a couple days she got the point and came and said sorry to me. that’s how I got over a ex… I hope you can relate <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
