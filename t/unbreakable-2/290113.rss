    <title>Unbreakable 2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unbreakable-2/290113</link>
    <description>If any of you saw Unbreakable, I&#39;m sure you could appreciate the amount of detail in this movie, the underlying plot. All of it worked so perfectly, and made such an awesome movie. Shyamalan really did an amazing job with this movie, and with amazing actors like Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, this movie was a hit with me.

But anyways, there&#39;s speculation a sequel to this awesome movie may come about. All I have to say is, Bruce Willis better be the starring role, and I want a return from Mr. Glass. And this movie better not suck like his last few.

              <p>This is about Comic Book Hero’s, the bad guy can always get out of jail. Shyamalan actually said he wants to go back to his mindset when he wrote Unbreakable. So he acknowledges his last movie sucked. Hopefully he can capture what he had initially with Unbreakable.</p>
<p>If he screws it up though… There will be MANY angry fans. Seriously, if he fucks up what he did with Unbreakable, I will be pissed.</p>

              <p>get ready for another “The Happening”, it’s gonna be a shitstorm. Unbreakable was a good movie although I don’t think shanananman has any more good films left in him. Mr. Glass will most likely not be returning as he is imprisoned. If they don’t have Bruce Willis as the main they might as not have the movie :O!!</p>
