    <title>Looking for developer!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-developer/547745</link>
    <description>The topic says it all, pretty much I need a developer for my pi 317 server. I don&#39;t really have much time on my hands to code what needs done, there is not much that needs done to the server to bring it alive. Id appreciate any help I can get with this I have a lot of good ideas for the game! So whoever is out there ready to get a rsps up and running hit me up I can get it online in no time I already have everything ready for it! Thank You</description>
