    <title>Looking for Developer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-developer/334086</link>
    <description>Hello, my name is Zankza, i am not much of poster, but i am mostly reading around.
 Lately, Ive been pushing to start a networking, a serious dedicated of various cool &amp; fun private servers.

I used to play runescape, i know it can be good, only if the developer put alot of time and loyal to it.

I am offering a free host on a datacenter(dedicated server)

And the catch is, your trust and i am the main admin(i WONT help developing, and most of time i wont even really login at all, i am expecting you to take almost everything else taken care of. including players problems etc.)

Basically i am a sponsor, i just want to create a fun dedicated networking, i know there is great developers, ideas but they just cant promote to higher level of hosting stable, this might be one of long rare chance.

Here&#39;s a picture from the older messed up thread.(other forum, if you inist i can  put a new fresh picture)
[spoiler][IMG]http://i40.tinypic.com/2yy42rs.png[/img][/spoiler]
Dedicated is already paided for next few months, and their hosting quality is one of best in world.


To brief things up
I am looking for a either Already TEAM or a alone dedicated developer, who can prove me he/she has knowledge and able to take care of everything else by theirself.
Catch is; I am the main admin, you work under me, and your loyal &amp; trust.

No 50 dollar for mod or admin or co-owner etc, 50 dollar for dragon set, donation, or item mall, whatever you ever call them.(you dont have to pay dont get wrong idea)

to staffs, please lock or delete my older thread, its mess and dont have enough information, thanks.(http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,430453.0.html)</description>
