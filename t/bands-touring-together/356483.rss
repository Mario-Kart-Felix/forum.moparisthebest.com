    <title>Bands touring together?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bands-touring-together/356483</link>
    <description>So as I have expressed on these forums on a few occasions, I would LOVE to see Children of Bodom live in concert.  Problem is, they never come anywhere near my city...which is odd seeing as we are the capital of my country :(

Either way, I heard about &quot;Black Label Berzerkus&quot;.  Here is the details:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Metal guitarist Zakk Wylde will launch the Black Label Berzerkus this fall, headlined by Wylde&#39;s Black Label Society. The two-month North American tour will feature Clutch, Children Of Bodom and 2Cents, with the first two bands sharing the main support slot.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Don&#39;t get me wrong, BLS is an alright group, but still if I go it will be to see COB.

So I am wondering, since I have never been to a concert involving so many bands...how much play time and how many tracks do you think COB would be performing?  The tickets aren&#39;t cheap and I don&#39;t want to buy unless I think the big reason I am going would be worth it.

Thanks for the help guys!</description>

              <p>[quote=“la­wl, post:2, topic:356483”]do you live near toronto? satch is coming in december and is way better than cob !![/quote]I live in ottawa, so about 4 hours away.  And I like a couple bands more than COB but it has just been a dream of mine for a long time to see them do a nice set list live so I jump at the first chance I get.  I will listen to satch though and if I like them definitely check them out too.  Thanks!</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Oh you meant Joe Satriani.  My bad I’m a little slow tonight.  Definitely gonna check that out too!</p>

I went to Gigantour a few years ago and COB were there along with Job for a Cowboy, High on Fire, In Flames and Megadeth.<br>
JFAC and HoF only played for about an hour at the most each, then it was Bodom who played for about 2 hours and same with in flames then Megadeth, who was headlining, was a little longer</p>
