    <description>As other crap is posted in this section. Why not just post it here?

Alright, well Moparscape is the place all the other popular sites laugh at for our, Server Status, Forums, noobs, and mainly how nothing is done on this site.

We have 3 main reasons.

1)Our sections are awful, as we don&#39;t even have a snippets section, (we have a sticky), and we don&#39;t have a 508+ sections, 317 section, 377-474 section.
Client hacking, is not even &quot;hacking&quot; as we know so much about a client its considered a client tutorial/snippet
Tutorials, are just about only login protocals (which no one cares about in the community), our tutorials also have nothing useful for beginners (more tutorials, less questions)
Our help threads are dead awful (i try to help when i&#39;m on)

2) Awful staff, we have a bunch of random crap posted in the client hacking section (including this) and nothing is being done, but a lock MAYBE. This is NOT a help section people. The staff is mostly rude to newer players, and other people who post maybe &quot;Noobish&quot; things. (SilentCj your doing great)

3) Updates, polls.. We [b]ARE NOT INFORMED[/b] on anything that goes on here, we are A [b]COMMUNITY[/b]
meaning, we should have polls, news, announcements, and updates on what goes on here.

People like me who have been here for 3 years, and watched this community fall is apart, is pretty sad. Once the #1 community, became the worst known community for its lack of these things, and failure of updates. 


This community will end up dying without these proper things, as 317 servers are not like what they were.

<p>No we are not telling you to get rid of models, or to do what ever to your models, we are saying models which do not belong in RUNESCAPE MODELS in a RUNESCAPE private server should not be in modeling section.</p>

I agree.</p>
<p>Moparscape should had the model section, but have different sections.</p>
<p>like:</p>
<p>Helmets<br>
Swords<br>
Armour<br>
Bows<br>
Shields</p>
<p>Also, like you said a 317 section, 377, 474, 508 ect…</p>
<p>Then there should be a section for emotes, maps, and other client related stuff…</p>
<p>Moparscape is getting organized with the Interface section…</p>
<p>Not a bad idea, but then again, there is no hope for mopar.  It’s all leechers…<br>
[/quote]The model section shouldn’t even be there. Nearly every model in there has NOTHING to do with RSPS, and are just to show off your skills. The admin who added it was out of their mind or saw that the stubborn people of MoparScape didn’t care about development, but only creating models because they love comments.</p>
<p>We don’t have awful staff overall. There isn’t really any bad staff member, but sections that are bad. For example, this board. It’s not Fat_Cookies or whoever else that moderates this board’s fault.</p>
<p>Another reason we’re stuck behind all of the other communities is because very few people who really know what they’re doing stay to help and continue with RSPS, as everyone else just quits or goes onto MITB. There is also no active global moderators or admins here, and it’s not like any of the admins do anything. I haven’t seen Lothy do anything in a long time, Niall is apparently lazy as fuck, and Moparisthebest is way too busy to even come on. All of the other admins are never active either.</p>
<p>Finally, almost the whole community has no experience in anything. Most are extremely young and shouldn’t even be using the internet, and others are just either into RSPS for the money (which is sad and any server that sells something on it should be prohibited, but sadly the staff are too blind to realize that’s killing private servers/horrible) or just want to be able to run their own server, whether or not it’s been edited by them.[/quote]<br>
Most? Most people here, believe it or not, don’t even know how to run a server, and whats with you trying to stop us on modeling and making our own stuff for <span class="bbcode-u">our</span> private servers?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 05, 2010, 09:37:37 pm[/size][hr][quote=“The Soul, post:11, topic:324144”][quote author=the elve age link=topic=420545.msg3089298#msg3089298 date=1262746584]<br>

<p>Very very well put. If we honestly had organized sections (i’m not saying this cause i’m a “noob”)<br>
I would actually release some of my stuff.<br>
As for most of MY work is server sided, and i can’t even post without a decent tutorial section.</p>
<p>The model section should be “Runescape Models” As high poly models aren’t excepted in there anymore.</p>

<p>Yes, it really is something to rofl at when you edit someone else post. Need some humor or friends; <span class="bbcode-s">Moparscape isn’t the place.</span> Moparscape isn’t the place for you at least.</p>

Swords<br>
Armour<br>
Bows<br>
Shields</p>
<p>Also, like you said a 317 section, 377, 474, 508 ect…</p>
<p>Then there should be a section for emotes, maps, and other client related stuff…</p>
<p>Moparscape is getting organized with the Interface section…</p>

<p>And about your rant about the staff: it’s not their fault, it’s the community as a whole’s. We’re not doing our job by reporting enough. They don’t need to spend their own time sifting through threads looking for rule-breakers when one individual can report it and it’s dealt with.</p>

              <p>As other crap is posted in this section. Why not just post it here?</p>
<p>Alright, well Moparscape is the place all the other popular sites laugh at for our, Server Status, Forums, noobs, and mainly how nothing is done on this site.</p>
<p>We have 3 main reasons.</p>
<p>1)Our sections are awful, as we don’t even have a snippets section, (we have a sticky), and we don’t have a 508+ sections, 317 section, 377-474 section.<br>
Client hacking, is not even “hacking” as we know so much about a client its considered a client tutorial/snippet<br>
Tutorials, are just about only login protocals (which no one cares about in the community), our tutorials also have nothing useful for beginners (more tutorials, less questions)<br>
Our help threads are dead awful (i try to help when i’m on)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Awful staff, we have a bunch of random crap posted in the client hacking section (including this) and nothing is being done, but a lock MAYBE. This is NOT a help section people. The staff is mostly rude to newer players, and other people who post maybe “Noobish” things. (SilentCj your doing great)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updates, polls… We <span class="bbcode-b">ARE NOT INFORMED</span> on anything that goes on here, we are A <span class="bbcode-b">COMMUNITY</span><br>
meaning, we should have polls, news, announcements, and updates on what goes on here.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>People like me who have been here for 3 years, and watched this community fall is apart, is pretty sad. Once the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> community, became the worst known community for its lack of these things, and failure of updates.</p>
<p>This community will end up dying without these proper things, as 317 servers are not like what they were.</p>
<p>Thanks - The Elve Age</p>
