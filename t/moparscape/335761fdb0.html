You can&amp;#39;t change the world with a fist and a gun, but you can preach to it with a microphone. 

I can&amp;#39;t force anyone on these forums to do anything, i probably can&amp;#39;t even teach them.

<p>Thats the problem. All of these servers should be banned and moparscape should be required to use a new clean and correctly programmed one, the community will work together to add things in it could settle the disputes between members along with the flaming.<br>
[/quote]I agreed with you on everything up until now. You’re talking about the community recovering, but you’re suggesting something that will just eliminate users altogether. By limiting the server sources aloud, users will abandon moparscape completely. I get your point though.</p>
<p>We don’t need sub forums for cache versions. It’s incredibly easy to decipher the questions asked pertaining to their version. It takes me one quick glance at the question/tutorial to realize the difference.</p>
<p>The mods are not cocky. Being lazy doesn’t make you cocky. Flaunting their abilities (which they don’t) would make a moderator cocky. Being cocky as a user would mean they’d have to boast about themselves and perhaps their status, which I don’t see any of them doing. I can understand where you’re coming from when you say that though, as most of them are the elites of moparscape. Elitists tend to have that “cocky” effect on the community I suppose.</p>
<p>What we simply need to do is purge the threads, users, and posts that taint the community. After consistently doing so, there shouldn’t be much activity resulting in corruption.</p>
<p>Might I also add, this thread has gone 3 pages without being reminded that there is a “community complaints” thread. The purpose was for LesterKnome to make a larger approach on the situation, but that doesn’t mean everyone else should be aloud to voice out of the original thread.</p>
<p>Further your posts here, or you’re technically all hypocrites.<br>
<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,418871.0.html%5B/quote%5D" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,418871.0.html[/quote]</a></p>
<p>Yes! lets post on page 53! Thats flamed thread. This is a discussion.</p>
<p>In my opinion i think of the mods as cocky, and yes some of them do boast highly of themselves, and do not figure to even bother helping others.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/frell-2.html">@Frell</a> Rs2hd was actually not good at all. And Graham said it himself, it was rather buggy, and now Hyperion is available (500 on a normal connection, and can hold 2k players)</p>

        <p>Im not talking about those servers, i mean make an actual new one for the 500+ generation. Most of the 500+ servers suck because they’re based on palidino’s, which he ripped code from WL to do it and thought he was god when he got it to work. Anyone could have done that on mitb, but they didn’t want to because the winterlove server was horrible, and they cba’d to rewrite a new one.</p>

        <blockquote>Today we are judged by the controversial aristocrats that truly rule this community.</blockquote>
<p>Agreed. There are flamers and spammers here that somehow seem to everyone to be ‘cool’ and everyone just does whatever they do. They become friends with moderators and can do whatever they want.</p>
<p>Also, some staff members do things and flaunt their powers (back to T-R-X’s explanation of ‘cocky’) just because of personal problems or trying to be cool.</p>
<p>I hid the name of the staff person because if I revealed who it was they would ban me.</p>

        <p>You didn’t sensor them enough. You can easily figure out who they are. I’ve noticed that a lot of members in this community are a bit ignorant. Not just focusing on that IRC conversation either. Of course, it is a good example of what I’m talking about. Both of those users are good friends of mine. There are members I’m friends with that are way more exaggerated than others. I’m friends with `Lewk_, AMERIKA, (Anthony) who was previously banned, and I was also friends with Telenim at one point. All of these users were banned for their ignorance or immaturity, but we’re all still part of this community. It’s all a matter of how you voice it. The whole system of moparscape is corrupted, as is everything else on earth. What’s really wrong with the community that actually needs to be changed are the posts that lead to this corruption. As many members have said before, if users are going to continually troll and get away with it, it’s a gateway for other users to do it.</p>

Your last statement is very true. But the only reason those users were getting away with it was because they were friends with (a/the) corrupt moderator(s).</p>

<p>Aside from the blatant inaccuracy of Frells’ post; the problem with Moparscape is actually quite blindingly simple: The people it attracts. Moparscape consistently attracts the stupidest, most ignorant, and least capable people available on the internet. This is heinously obvious in retrospect: Moparscapers are primarily drawn by the promise of free Runescape items; these in turn are people who are such great failures that they can not even succeed at Runescape (Which is itself the bottom feeder of online games). The simplest and most useful thing you can do for Moparscape is what Taharok and Niall have already done, which is to leave. This is what everyone is always doing already; though you may not be aware of it, the majority of new members leave several weeks after joining, they are replaced at such great rate their absence goes unnoticed. This is why all of your vacuous lecturing on change will be ineffective, even if any action results from it: The lions share of the people who you’ve influenced will have been replaced by next week.</p>
<p>Indeed, anyone who has been here long enough and hasn’t succumbed to the temptations of wishful thinking will attest that things are exactly as they always were and always have been, albeit moreso.</p>
<p>If you have any merit to your existence save for injecting more bureaucracy into the universe, you will not realize it here.[/quote]</p>
<p>completely true. I respect your literalistic dexterity and your point of view.</p>

Calling the moderator ‘mod1’.</p>
<p>The corrupt moderator (we all know who it is) doesn’t even let the people off the hook, mod1 condones it. Only for the few people that are mod1’s friends however. If the moderator dislikes someone they will twist the rules anyway they can, and find flaws in posts where a normal moderator would not find anything wrong. They strive to punish people they dislike however they can, even if the person did nothing wrong. I go back to:</p>
<blockquote>moparisthebest, would you turn a blind eye to a bad of a true idiot?</blockquote>
mod1 knows what he's doing is wrong, but continues it because s/he has all of the special powers of a moderator. When I ask how mod1 even got those powers, the response I got from a different moderator was:
<blockquote>stfu unless you want ban, stop asking questions</blockquote>

        <p>I’d appreciate it if we weren’t using any more examples, as it will only make matters worse. Although you believe it deserves the publicity, I can’t see any way to be more hypocritical by disrespecting them this way. Everyone that cares knows who the moderators are, so there’s no need to point them out.</p>
<p>On the other hand, pointing them out as a <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">good</span></span> example is something different. I say this because I wanted to give a reply to this:</p>
<p>[quote=“casey., post:68, topic:335761”]Because many of us are friends with staff we feel invincible because we know they won’t punish us. Even I would let my friends off the hook with a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>This needs to stop.[/quote]Taharok is a prime example. Sorry if you think I’m sucking his dick, but honestly I believe he was the best moderator because of his lack of biased decisions. He fulfilled the roll as a moderator respectively, with pure judgment based on the forums rules. It would be amazing if the moderators would follow in his footsteps, as the best on their team left.</p>
<p>Their are rules so incredibly strict about “leaking information” for the moderators that they get their title revoked (Kihomura incident if any of you remember). So why is it that they can get away with corruptible behavior, as well as the choice of ignorance to their community? Also, in my opinion, putting the community under this form of “oppression” is exponentially worse than having multiple accounts, so why is it that the staff prioritize that over corruption?</p>
<p>Abuse of power is evident in the community, but nothing is done about it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edit</span>:<br>
I would just like to add, although once this is all said and done, Moparscape has thee best staff out of any RSPS community. You may not think so, but because all of them have been in the RSPS scene so long, it’s obvious they have the upper hand on their positions. They know exactly what’s typical in an RSPS forum. Also, the requirements to become a mod are incredibly high on the expectation scale. No one is accepted as a moderator unless they’re on the higher end of the spectrum, and there are very few that are capable of fulfilling the position. Judgment is hard to do without being a little biased, so I give them credit for that, and I expect everyone here to do the same.</p>

        <p>At your last paragraph:</p>
<p>You are very correct in saying that you can never make a decision that seems unbiased, but there is a difference between ‘being a little biased’ and just flat out corrupted. If a moderator only locks topics or does other moderator duties when a friend asks them to, or punishes people when a friend asks them to, they are not just a ‘little biased.’ Not that all moderators are like that, because most of them are great. Taharok was a prime example. He didn’t lock topics because he didn’t like them, he would lock them if they broke the rules. He didn’t punish people because he didn’t like them, he would punish them if they broke the rules. Yes, we used to have the best staff of any RSPS site, and most of our staff members are still better than other sites, but things do have to change. I would also like to point out how some of the not-so-great staff members used to be kind and uncorrupted, but either that was an act, or they just changed. If people change do they still deserve power? If the president all of a sudden declares nuclear war on Russia would he still remain president? No, we would impeach him. I think the hierarchy of the forum needs to take another look at it’s staff members.</p>

Same here, I don’t even think any of the moderators know I am even here. Also the top few paragraphs are all valid. Everyone knows who this “mod1” person is and it needs to stop. Honestly one of the most respected programmer has left this site, and I don’t blame him. If you have not picked up from previous topics, this person is Lin. Myself and Lin have had a few valuable conversations and I find him a respectful person. I hope everyone else does too.</p>

Feel special guys.<br>

Same here, I don’t even think any of the moderators know I am even here. Also the top few paragraphs are all valid. Everyone knows who this “mod1” person is and it needs to stop. Honestly one of the most respected programmer has left this site, and I don’t blame him. If you have not picked up from previous topics, this person is Lin. Myself and Lin have had a few valuable conversations and I find him a respectful person. I hope everyone else does too.[/quote]Lin left? Wtf… so much happened when I was on vacation…</p>

<p>Agreed. There are flamers and spammers here that somehow seem to everyone to be ‘cool’ and everyone just does whatever they do. They become friends with moderators and can do whatever they want.</p>
<p>Also, some staff members do things and flaunt their powers (back to T-R-X’s explanation of ‘cocky’) just because of personal problems or trying to be cool.</p>
<p>I hid the name of the staff person because if I revealed who it was they would ban me.</p>

Summary of convo:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flames me</li>
<li>Talks how `Lewk_ is 100% flame and isn’t banned, but the other person is (discussed earlier in convo)</li>
<li>Admits to banning people for no reason (flaunting powers)</li>
<li>Proves the staff members are corrupt (‘blind eye’)[/quote]<br>
I can clearly see that is mdog from the pictures.</li>
