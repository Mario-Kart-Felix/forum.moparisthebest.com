    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape/331882</link>
    <description>This community has about 9 moderators online at the moment, none of which do their job to the littlest extent. The members of this community are amongst the rudest people, for those who know none of which they speak. I found it quite amusing, to see people fail to know about Devolution&#39;s history and present, to which they can post assuming I am pretending to be Josh, what a joke this place is. An SMF forums with a terribly boring server, I see Mopar has come no further than the begging. The server development section appears to be the home of those who are looking to own a server, they simply post that they need the following -
- a client &quot;coder&quot;
- a server &quot;coder&quot;
- A forums developer
- host.

how much more can you ask for? a blowjob?

Thanks so much Moparscape, for proving such a valid point.

It was said to me that Mopar was the worst community, and it is common to see on real communities, leechers posting and being told to &quot;go back to mopar&quot; or see &quot;this belongs on mopar /facepalm&quot;

What a joke.</description>

<p>Seriously you joined the community and posted like 5 tutorials in one day. Now you b***h that people are flaming you. You have no life or don’t understand the word “LEAVE ALREADY”. Instead you post another thread “LAST POST” and b*<strong>h about mopar. Mopar is where everyone starts, Everyone here knows what they talk about. What you do is like downloading a server and re-releasing it named “LOLBanned V1.0 = PRO SERVER = CODED FOR 4 MONTHS”<br>
Then type a bunch of bulls</strong>t and give a download link. Seriously go kill your self or leave Mopar.</p>

Yes because if the moderator’s got hacked by some dumbasses and deleted boards then it would be doing us a favor. /facepalm<br>

Quite clearly you didn’t understand what I meant by ‘doing you a favour’. By deleting everything, all the shit would be gone. Understand?[/quote]Do you believe in a cumulative? Over time the amount of threads posted obviously builds up for not only previous reference, but also as resource. Any community that has staff that completely refurbishes their boards due to “garbage” is a joke. What are they doing? Making space for <span class="bbcode-b">more</span> garbage yet to come? They’re contradicting themselves.</p>

Also there are useful things on this site, just because your a moparscaper only doesn’t mean there’s nothing useful.<br>
[/quote]<br>
This site as in <a href="http://moparisthebest.com">moparisthebest.com</a>? I don’t think so. Amount of crap things &gt; Amount of useful things.[/quote]As if every other community’s crap is &lt; their useful…?</p>
<p>[quote=“T3arful, post:28, topic:331882”]Also as to why everyone on this thread has raged at this kid is beyond me.[/quote]Because he’s bitching about this community as if the whole community has attacked him. He acts as if his fuck-up has opened his eyes to some true form of moparscape, revealing that it’s a load of garbage. There’s not much better out there; anyone could create a thread of the same relevance on any other forum.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>, there have been countless amounts of threads such as yours. Perhaps you have a sense of achievement, hoping that the rest of the community is going to see a new light. If this is the case, I’d like to inform you that there is no hope for changing what is mopar.</p>
<p>edit: By the way, staff discussion is overrated.</p>

<p>There are a lot more communities, that would have people that are much ruder if it wasn’t for the communist way rules imposed on them.  I mean all forums have rules like that, but look how more lenient than other forms we are with it.</p>

<p>What is this I don’t even…  Mopar really hasn’t come far.  That is why he release Moparscape 4, which is more advanced than anything you could come up with, or any of the other sites you seem to love so much.</p>
<p>[quote=“LOLBanned, post:1, topic:331882”]It was said to me that Mopar was the worst community, and it is common to see on real communities, leechers posting and being told to “go back to mopar” or see “this belongs on mopar /facepalm”</p>

This belongs on mopar /facepalm…</p>
<p>tl;dr:  You’re an idiot, you have no idea what you’re talking about, and your just pissed off that we caught you leeching (from another topic on this forums?), and told you to gtfo.</p>
