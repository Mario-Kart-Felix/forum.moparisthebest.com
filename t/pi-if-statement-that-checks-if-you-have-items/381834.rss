    <title>[PI] if statement that checks if you have items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-if-statement-that-checks-if-you-have-items/381834</link>
    <description>hello,
wondering if someone can help me with this. ive used something similar to stop players from teleporting without the required amount of items equiped, how would i change this to check if the player has the item and required amount of that item before being aloud to complete the if statement.

[code]c.getPA().getWearingAmount() &gt; 5[/code]

any ideas? so it checks for item id and if there are moe or less than 5

would this work or have i done it wrong? [code]c.getItems().getItemSlot(995) &gt; 5[/code]</description>
