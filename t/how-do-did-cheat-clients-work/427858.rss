    <title>How do/did cheat clients work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-did-cheat-clients-work/427858</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if there still a problem as i drop in and out of the rsps community every 6 months or so, but I remember a while ago there used to be a problem called cheat clients where idk like a player just became an admin or something through the use of a client that did something?

-how do/did cheat clients work?

-I am using an azure v3 base with MITB&#39;s client and I want to know if thats secure? Most likely this server wont ever see the light of day as im just using it to play around with but say it did is MITB&#39;s client &#39;insecure&#39; or something? is that why people started editing there own clients?

I wasn&#39;t sure if this was general programming (as i would like to know how clients can hack a server?) or rsps development(as i am curious about using MITB&#39;s client).</description>

              <p>I wrote a whole thread containing the general concept of them, but not on these forums. I am yet to find a server that has protection against fake packets, due to many of them disabling things such as rsa and isaac. Pretty much you can do anything you want that there is a packet for. (Adding global objects, removing them, walking patterns, ect)</p>

              <p>One of the sure ways to cheat is to spawn objects onto your pallete since servers don’t have landscape object checks. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> As for item, it’s really easy to detect and remove. I’m sure you could also spawn NPCs on the pallete as well and use them as you would objects. I don’t see why you would want to do that but you could.</p>
<p>I can also see server’s crashing from the NPC issue because when you send an attack packet they may not check for if the identification number is greater than the amount of NPCs allowed to spawn. Since an ArrayOutOfBoundsException is a Runtime exception than it would kill the current thread it was executed on. Depending on the architecture of the server, that could completely shut down the server or just that particular thread which may have been very important to keep running.</p>
<p>T4 covers a couple of topics on the main ways of cheating but these are some other ways of doing it.</p>
