    <title>Sig i made about a year ago</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sig-i-made-about-a-year-ago/215791</link>
    <description>Gray on gray, yeah, kinda a dumb choice of colors but that&#39;s the color the render was and i didn&#39;t want to really put gray with other colors because i don&#39;t really know what looks good with gray.  It&#39;s basically a render with text and some c4ds in it, kinda lame and basic and pretty easy to make; there might be some brush strokes in there somewhere but if there are i can&#39;t point them out.
