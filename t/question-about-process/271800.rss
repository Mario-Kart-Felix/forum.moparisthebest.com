    <title>Question about process()</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-process/271800</link>
    <description>Ok so I&#39;m still kind of new to coding, and I just wanted to see if I understand correctly. I have read in a few different places that deleting things from process() reduces lag. Is this true? I was going to delete pest control and fight pits anyways, but just wanted to know if it will make a difference with the amount of  lag.</description>
