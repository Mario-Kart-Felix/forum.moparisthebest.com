    <title>Need a coder! (317)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-coder-317/525987</link>
    <description>I am looking for a 317 coder. I am currently working two jobs at 15 hours a day and just do not have the time to code anymore. I have multiple ideas that can be talked about and you will recieve 100% credits. I would like it to be an allstar based server but we can talk and work things out. I don&#39;t want to give any ideas away on here because it&#39;s things I haven&#39;t seen much or any of. So add me on skype -Crazycrashheim95- or e-mail me -Kyleheim@live.com- reply in post or message me on here if you think you can do it. Thanks a lot, Guardianman5

 Also, I could help out a little bit with the coding if you need some things done, but wont be to much haha</description>

I understand, that your irl job takes a lot of time, but then you shouldnt even start this kind of project, or are you ready to pay for work, what is done?</p>

Dude that’s like saying, buying a VPS is completely stupid, if you can’t run it yourself, why run it at all? That’s what you just said in different words.</p>

              <p>Well I havae allstarscape and I have done a little bit to it, I just need a couple of codes written which I’m sure I could find on this site somewhere but I just have no time at all to look for them or put them in, I guess I’ll just close this thread and do it on my own because I guess you are right. I’ll just need to find some time.</p>
<p>Can a mod please lock this? I’m done with it.</p>
