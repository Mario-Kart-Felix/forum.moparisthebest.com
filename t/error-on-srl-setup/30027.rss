    <title>Error on SRL Setup</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-on-srl-setup/30027</link>
    <description>Hello, 
Got to the &quot;Must Needs&quot; thread and SRL was first thing there. Went to download it and I Followed EVERY instruction given. Gave me the &quot;cannot find C:\Program Files\Scar 2.03\SRL/SRL.scar&quot; or somethng similar. I think its because when i extracted it INTO the SRL folder I made it then made another SRL folder inside the one i made, and i dont know how to get rid of this. If someone can help, thanks!</description>

              <p>Delete the folder you have called C:\Program Files\Scar 2.03\SRL.<br>
Get the SRL installation .exe and run it in the folder C:\Program Files\Scar 2.03. This will place it inside of the includes folder and it will work correctly then if you {.include SRL\SRL.scar}</p>
