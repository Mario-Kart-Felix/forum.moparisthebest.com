    <title>Ip logging onto completely different server! help now, please fix</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ip-logging-onto-completely-different-server-help-now-please-fix/225587</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;ve been playing rune-revolution.no-ip.org, and it was on today, but 30 minutes after being offline of it, I log on again, and it goes to &quot;phoenix pkz scape&quot; which is completely wierd, and I haven&#39;t ever been able to log onto it anymore.

This seems like the same thing that happened with obituary.no-ip.biz logging onto &quot;firexfold scape&quot;.

Please respond immediately I just want to get back to magic training on rune-revolution.no-ip.biz. 

Thank you for your time.

(sorry for making your eyes bleed)

              <p>Well heres the deal its one of those things where u click on the title and its the fake ip, and it was supposedly a fake server, but it was in fact, running, which was how my brother found out, and he told me, and the real is like something different, and all of the sudden the server goes nowhere, so its basically untraceable, since it was though to be fake, but was actually a fully functional server…</p>
