    <description>hello just coding some donator features.

So far i have you get access to donator zone
extreme donators get access to a dice bag.
you can buy items which comes bundled with members.
Buying non tradeable items for donator island.

Im thinking about offering a donator zone pack which then gives you access to another island for super donators. However what else would you or players look for if you were going to donate to a server?


Also what company would you recommend for hosting im going to buy a domain. but i also want databases for a forum,vote4reward and instant update donating shop. All mysql. Finally whats a good company for cheap yet effective vps that can have 100+ players at one time and is 24/7.</description>
