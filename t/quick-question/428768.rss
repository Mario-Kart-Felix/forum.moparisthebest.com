    <title>Quick question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quick-question/428768</link>
    <description>[b]I am new to this coding stuff, I usually just download servers and clients and make it my own.
I will not be releasing these as I&#39;m not a leecher :)
Anyway, I really need something that a COMPLETE NOOB can work with.
What source is recommended and maybe a client that goes with it?
I hear PI is good? Or Delta? I just need to know what the best thing to work with is :)
Cheers.[/b]</description>

              <p>The best thing to work with is starting a revision of your own. This could take months, or possibly even years (depending on how quickly you can learn the language of Java). There is no best thing out right now, because they all have problems in some type of manner; Good luck!</p>
