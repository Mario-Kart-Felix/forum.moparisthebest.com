    <description>Ok, I have tryed creating a no-ip server but didnt work out. Now i&#39;m going to use Hamachi, i went to Hamachi.cc and downloaded but it doesnt work. I got to the step where it says connecting, and makes me type in my name. But then it just keeps reconnecting. Anybody know whats wrong? And by the way i&#39;m using a wireless network and my connection is great, (not sure if that has to do with anything).

   Post&#39;s are very appretiated.[br][size=1]Posted on: February 04, 2007, 01:33:46 AM[/size][hr]Ok, I have tryed creating a no-ip server but didnt work out.
