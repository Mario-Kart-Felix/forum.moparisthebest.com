    <title>Quick question</title>

    <description>How would I go about making it to where admins can log on, and still allow others to log on as well?
Right now if an Admin is logged on, then it&#39;s like the server is locked, and others can&#39;t log in.

I also need help with a simple starters command to give them 100k cash to start them off.
Any help would be much appreciated.


[Sorry for the noob questions, I&#39;m new to Java. ^^;]
Please help?</description>
