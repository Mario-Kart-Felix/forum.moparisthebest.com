              <p>yea uhh…apparentlly nothing is wrong. It is already running. And your IP isnt 127.0.0.1 thats your local loopback connection. You have to get a IP off of <a href="http://no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a> when you make your no-ip account. Make sure that you did that and that you started your no-ip and that your host address(no-ip address) is running. Oh yes and a little extra info:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You dont need to enter the no-ip address…Enter 127.0.0.1 or localhost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to forward your ports if you have a router.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the host in your no-ip has a little rosey cheeck smiley face. That means that it is online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that your port is most likely 43954(default), 5555, or 1234.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When supplying your info for people to get on your server tell them the port, host name (no-ip name thing), and a little about your server (rules, commands, ETC.)</p>
