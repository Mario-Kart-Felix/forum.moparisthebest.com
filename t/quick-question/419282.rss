    <title>Quick question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quick-question/419282</link>
    <description>Basically, what i am trying to do, is create a shop, that buys and sells tickets, called &#39;paramyayamayamayamamam&#39; blahhhhh or w/e, and i&#39;ve done everything as i thought i should have.

So, i have the shop, set up, spawned, tradeable, the items are in there, all for the correct price... but,
I wanted it so, you could sell your tickets back to the store for 2147m.

Idea - When you get max cash, you can buy a ticket from the store, and have them stack in your bank, allowing you to technically have more than 2147m, but in items.

You can buy the tickets fine for 2147m, but when it comes to trading them back for the cash, you only get about 1.9b... rather than the full amount. :S

I&#39;m sorry if this is a noob question, but.. i kinda am a noob.

Thanks in advance!</description>

              <p>Well, i’d already changed all the prices on items.cfg, all 3 are 2147000000, which is the correct amount, as you can see on the pic, but, what config file? :S</p>
