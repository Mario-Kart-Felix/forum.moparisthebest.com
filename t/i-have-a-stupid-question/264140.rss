open your item.cfg, and after an items Examine information<br>
there should be 3 numbers<br>
those are the buy\sell prices<br>
i recommend just keeping them all the same</p>
<p>then with changing exp rate<br>
open your client.java<br>
and search “Exprate”<br>
there are different exp rates for different items<br>
(melee, range, and mage) be sure to change all of them[/quote]It does help. And about 80% of servers don’t have EXP rate, and there are more then 3 numbers. THAT DOES not help.</p>

You have 2 stupid questions.</p>
<p>Item prices are somewhere in item.cfg, go figure that out. And changing fighting XP rates are simple.</p>
