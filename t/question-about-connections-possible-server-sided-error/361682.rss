    <title>Question about connections.. possible server sided error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-connections-possible-server-sided-error/361682</link>
    <description>Really weird to ask I know, but most of the people out there are having issues with the client. The server is running fine with just me on my own computer (connecting to 127.0.0.1), but when I enter my no-ip address into, it doesn&#39;t seem to work. :confused:
At first I thought that something was just wrong with the client, but I soon discovered otherwise. The client is able to connect to other servers I have on my computer (old czar age stuff), but isn&#39;t able to connect to this one using my no-ip address. Has anybody run into this issue at all, or do you know how to possibly fix? checked my server class, and it&#39;s running on port 43594, same as the client. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Here&#39;s a video I uploaded showing utorrent&#39;s port check working for other servers on my computer but not this one, to show that I port forwarded correctly.

Here&#39;s the code from client class.
[code]	public URL getCodeBase()
	{
		if(signlink.mainapp != null)
		return signlink.mainapp.getCodeBase();
		try
		{
			return new URL(&quot;http:75.128.206.13:&quot; + (80));
		}
		catch(Exception _ex)
		{
		}
		return null;
	}
	//public String server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;[/code]</description>
