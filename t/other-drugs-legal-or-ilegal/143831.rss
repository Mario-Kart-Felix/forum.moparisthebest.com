    <description>what have you done or made?
im quite into the chemistry side of it... sure, ive smoked a bit o tobacco, and am probably gunna do pot soon, and DEFENATELY do some salvia if i can get my hands on some.
my experiences:
ive been cooking up some DMT by doing an acid base extraction using some of the natural acacia around here(specifically acacia maidenii)
i really wanna get my hands on some salvia divinorum seeds or maybe a bit of stem to graft or grow.
after this extraction i am gunna try to make some MDMA, which is a REALLY hard extraction/synthesis.

note: one of the driving forces behind me making these is because i want to experience them as safely as possible,  and what could be more safe then cooking them yourself?

i do NOT in any way recommend the taking of drugs by anyone under the age of 18.  however once you hit 18, you are probably mature enough to make an informed decision.

if you do try it when you are 18, i suggest you make your own... its really facinating stuff.

if i were to reccommend you in your adventures:
start off trying to make DMT. its perhaps the EASIEST extraction i have ever seen, period.
however you might find a bit of troube finding the necessary ingredient if you live outside autralia.

note: i do NOT condone drug use in any way shape or form, however as this is a discussion forum, i believe we can have a civilized discussion without anything illegal happening
note: discussion of drugs is not illegal as long as you do not tell people to make them, or instruct them how to.</description>

              <p>i’ve been having alot of trouble with my latest DMT extraction, normal acid/base extraction, however i was using a different plant, acacia podalyriifolia as opposed to acacia maidenii.  i havnt been getting ANY product whatsoever, even when i heat up the aqueous solution to around 60* in the microwave before adding the naptha(heat = more DMT binding to naptha)<br>
i used 1kg of fresh bark, but im starting to think there is no DMT in this plant at all, im especially skeptical because wikipedia is the only site i can see that says it contains up to 2% DMT</p>

<p>Generally, the labs explode because people are too stupid to handle volatile solvents and don’t realise that when you’re playing with stuff like ether, the fumes settle. So, they put the jug of ether in the cupboard, and then immediately have a cigarette.</p>

              <p>I’ve only done diphenhydramine, DXM, and nutmeg, personally. Nutmeg didn’t work, DXM was great, and diphenhydramine was alright. The up about diphenhydramine is the great light-headed feeling one gets from using it which I love, but it also got me into a shitload of trouble with my parents. My DXM trip was basically me doing some interpretive dancing and writing poetry, along with that great light-headed feeling. Nutmeg just made me barf. So I’d recommend the DXM, suggest diphen to the desperate, and give nutmeg to the people I want to see unhappy.</p>

so really, all you are left with is naptha and DMT.<br>
the naptha evaporates(leaving NO residue, no impurities) leaving the DMT crystals in the bottom.<br>
so although you ARE using drain cleaner, there is NO way you can possibly inhale it.<br>

that is the biggest cop out i have ever heard, and i hear it really often.<br>
it gets me really angry when people say “oh, they cut it with ajax, they use drain cleaner blah blah blah”<br>
i do use 2 seperate types of drain cleaner, on oppisite ends of the spectrum(PH spectrum)<br>
i use HCL, hydrocloric acid, also known as muriatic acid, a good brick cleaner and drain cleaner.<br>
and caustic soda, another good drain cleaner.<br>
yet there is NONE of this in the end product.<br>
you seperate the product from the broth using a non polar solvent, in my case, i use colemans fuel, aka lighter fluid, aka naptha.</p>
<p>the naptha contains the product, and floats to the top of the mixture, i pour it through a tap system to drain away the Acid/base solution(its actually basic at the time, PH of about 11)<br>
so really, all you are left with is naptha and DMT.<br>
the naptha evaporates(leaving NO residue, no impurities) leaving the DMT crystals in the bottom.<br>
so although you ARE using drain cleaner, there is NO way you can possibly inhale it.</p>

              <p>I think it is good that all of these &lt; 15 year olds think drugs are bad and would never use them.  Certainly if you were to ask me if I would ever consider smoking weed 6 years ago when I was 15 years old I would have said the same thing, no way.  Drugs are bad mmmk? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>However, after I turned 17 and started drinking (legal drinking age here is 21), and then when 18 got introduced to weed it isn’t nearly as bad as schools and ‘the man’ would have you believe.  It still should not be done at an early age though. Personally I prefer alcohol over marijuana any day, in fact I don’t really like weed much at all, I only smoke sometimes after I am completely wasted already.</p>
<p>As to other drugs, I still think they are a bad idea.  Especially drugs like meth, have any of you seen the ingredient list for meth? It is entirely made up of parts that could each kill you separately, not to mention it is extremely hazardous to ‘cook up’ releasing toxic and explosive gases.  In fact around the area I live quite a few people have blown themselves up trying to cook up some meth, and the side effects seem just as bad or worse than cocaine or heroin.</p>
<p>Bottom line, any drug that leaves me with the potential to resort to sucking dick for ‘one more high’ I stay clear of. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
