    <description>hey all. i&#39;m not sure what the point of srl members is here, but hey i may as well apply ;)

you may have seen me at srl...my name is The Claw there as well and im an srl dev.

[b]Why you will be benificial to us as an SRL Member.[/b]
I&#39;m a pretty good scripter I reckon, not the best but not too bad either  :P I&#39;m not really that active here though, but I am at SRL. So dunno how much I can contribute here.

[b]Scripts that you have made.[/b]
Auto kebab buyer (first script, hardly completes 1 load), Varrock West Miner, Any-fish power fisher, Lumbridge swamp miner, and Crafting guild miner. All were released apart from crafting guild miner, which is going to be part of a bigger project.

[b]Other scripting languages you know (If any).[/b]
HTML, Javascript, a little php, VB.

[b]Example of a script you have made please.[/b]
