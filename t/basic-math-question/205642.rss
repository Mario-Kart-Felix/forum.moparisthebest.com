    <title>Basic math question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/basic-math-question/205642</link>
    <description>Basically I&#39;ve got a maths assignment, which I have finished except for the easy part.

It gives 2 samples of data, says one has errors, and has some questions revolving around the sample that has the &#39;best fit&#39; of a normal distribution which I&#39;ve done.

I am supposed to prove which sample has the best fit of a normal distribution, It&#39;s obvious which is which when you just look at it but I have to show it mathematically.

I hit up google and found that with a normal distribution, 68% is within 1 standard deviation of the average, 95% is within 2 SD&#39;s and 99.7% is within 3. I found how to calculate the standard deviation, tried it and it gave a bad answer so I&#39;m probably doing it wrong.

I am supposed to prove it using curve expert (http://www.ebicom.net/~dhyams/cftp.htm)
by showing 1,2 and 3 SD&#39;s, using something about showing intervals, and using a gaussian model and r^2 values with residuals.

I would appreciate some input as to how I can prove which is the best fit of a normal distribution.</description>
