    <title>Java Client problem help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-client-problem-help-please/527463</link>
    <description>I have a server and some people are unable to connect to the server due to there java being outdated (don&#39;t say to update cause they can&#39;t) they have an older version of OS X so they can&#39;t update there java further than it already is so I&#39;d like to make it so it works for any version of java that you have regardless of what java I compiled the client with. Thanks!</description>
