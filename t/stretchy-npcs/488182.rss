    <title>Stretchy NPCs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stretchy-npcs/488182</link>
    <description>I was adding pets into my server, I realised that they were all stretchy and glitchy, I was wondering if anyone knew how to fix this? I assume it&#39;s a client problem to do with one of my cache&#39;s files. If you could just tell me which one it is, I could fix it. (It&#39;s not called NPC btw, I&#39;ve tried finding that file in my cache, I don&#39;t use it apparently.)

I looked around for fixed on Google, for things like &quot;Stretchy NPC fix PI&quot; and others like that. None.

Here&#39;s an example picture of what I mean:
