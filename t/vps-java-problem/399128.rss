    <title>VPS Java problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vps-java-problem/399128</link>
    <description>Hey guys I just got my VPS so I installed java on it and downloaded my source to the VPS but when I try to compile it says &quot;Java is not recognized as internal command...blahblahblah&quot;

I also changed the directory of the compiler to the version of java I have so its not that.

Does anyone know where I went wrong?</description>
