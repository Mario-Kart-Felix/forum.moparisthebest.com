    <title>Character problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/character-problems/73712</link>
    <description>I was messing around with my privateserver (pimpscape). I made agility course and made a new character to test it, when I logged in it was total darkness and I couldnt see my character. On the server pop up thing (the black screen) it says that the character file not found. When it auto saved and I logged in again I was there with a lesser demon and suicided to be able to go to varrock. Anyone got an idea what I have to do?</description>

              <p>You get ‘Character File Not Found’ when you get a new character. It was just a glitch</p>
