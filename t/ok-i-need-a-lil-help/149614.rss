    <title>Ok i need a lil help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ok-i-need-a-lil-help/149614</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;m trying to make a no-ip.org server since I have hamachi and dont get many players.  How do I get my no-ip to work for my server.  I make a no-ip and opened my source and mopar.  I typed in my user and pass and the no-ip that i had just made....but nothing happened.  I dont really get the port and portforwarding thing, is that what makes it work?  If I need it what do I do?  I already tried God of Ikkiki&#39;s tut, but I didn&#39;t really get it on the port and portforward thing.  I have a linksys router.</description>
