Alright, whats the point you ask? Well Ill tell you, Running a server in a hidden window is great if your on a computer alot of people use, or if you have a friend or family member who likes to shut down your stuff.

-What you do-
First open Notepad or WordPad or similar and enter this into the new document

[code]var WindowStyle_Hidden = 0
var objShell = WScript.CreateObject(&quot;WScript.Shell&quot;)
var result = objShell.Run(&quot;cmd.exe /c INSERT FILE NAME&quot;, WindowStyle_Hidden)[/code]

Okay, your filename is more than likely going to be run.bat, but if you have something else put it there.

Save the file as FILENAME(run, runserver, w/e).js

To run the server in a hidden window, double click the Js file.

To Shut down the server, Right click the Task Bar and click Task Manager, Go into process and select cmd.exe and end the process.</description>
