    <description>i use Hybridscape..
well, i got the no-ip account and all, i got host- but when i try to log in it doesnt let me (i got the program, host updated, etc.) 
i cant log in.. i type my ip (and username only..) but it doesnt do any thing
(silentscape.no-ip.info doesnt worksss) so i tried from what the Hybridscape typed at the top of the screen when i load the program.. it gave me an ip, i try to login - and it says in the proram that i loged in and disconnected.. in the mopar, it says try usign an diffrent world or some thing.. and then in the DOS file of the Hybrid, it says: didnt save filef for idan (idan is the username i wrote..)
what to do?</description>
