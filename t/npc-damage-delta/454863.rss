    <description>Hey, one of you god like coders out there.
I am sure you can help me so please do,

I would like it if you were to show me how to make it so graardor does damage to people attacking him.

(i have added him so he walks fine, punches fine, blocks fine and dies fine all the emotes are there ect)

But when i fight him he doesnt do any damage to me!
 i have tried to edit some code to make him do damage but no its just constant 0&#39;s please help me

For my final request i ask that you tell or show me how to make it so he has a 1/5 chance of using another of his attack emotes and dealing damage to every player close to him and healing 100+- 50 hp.

[size=36pt]Thanks upfront![/size]</description>
