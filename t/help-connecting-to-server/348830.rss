    <title>Help connecting to server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-connecting-to-server/348830</link>
    <description>Ok, so I have my server up, my friends can connect to it, but when I try to connect It doesnt work
I tried 127.0.0.1
I tried 0.0.0.0
I tried localhost
I tried the server IP (the .no-ip.biz ip)
I tried the PF Ip (the ip before the .no-ip.biz
I dont know what to do, but my friends can do it but they havnt tried with the client, but I can&#39;t get any other client to load, so I am assuming its the client, but the client works for other people on other servers.</description>

              <p>What works for me is my ip 127.0.0.1, then copy the client and put the noip ip in tht one.</p>
<ol>
<li>run YOUR SOURCE ( 127.0.0.1 ) and i portforwarded with utorrent ( just get utorrent and go options then preferences, enter your port (43594) then check all boxes apart from “randomize port each start”!</li>
<li>Now open up noip and make sure the noip you are using that the box is UNCHECKED should have like sunglasses on.</li>
<li>Thats all u need to do, jsut leave noip, utorrent and the soruce up and your server will be online.</li>
</ol>
<p>Things To Remember - *ALLWAYS USE YOUR SOURCE AND CLEINT TO LOG INTO, NOT THE COPYED ONES.<br>
*Make sure internet is allways on!</p>
<ul>
<li>And just leave NOIP,UTORRENT AND THE SOURCE running.<br>
*SEND THE COPYED ONE TO YOUR MATES, JUST CLEINT NOT SORUCE.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helped man, i was stuck on this i know how annoying it got, enjoy your server ;D</p>
