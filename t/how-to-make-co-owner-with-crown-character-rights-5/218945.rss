Like this.</p>
<p><code>if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase("Co-Owner's name here"))
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = "Fallen Isle's Coder &amp; Owner, Co-Owner's name here, has logged in!";</code></p>
<p>and where to put it xD</p>
<p>[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>When you log in does your server say “Welcome to …”?</p>
<p>Ok, I’m not getting feedback.</p>
<p>Just right under where it says “Welcome to (Your Server)!”</p>
<p>After the last bracket add what I previously posted</p>
