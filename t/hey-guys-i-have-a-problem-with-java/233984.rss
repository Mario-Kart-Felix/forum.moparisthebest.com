You do not have Java installed. Please download it at the site that is about to load.

I have tried to figure out which one to download, and none of them work so far. If someone could give me the direct link..that would be awesome! Thanks, plz reply if possible!</description>

              <p>That’s not java.exe, that’s compiler.bat which is a batch file that calls the javac.exe and run.bat or server.bat calls the file java.exe. The problem is, you don’t have your path’s set properly. Set them properly.</p>
