    <title>Wilderness (Can&#39;t Attack!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wilderness-cant-attack/358144</link>
    <description>Hello,

I started editting Abbyscap3 Source.
But when I was almost done with all non-PK things I found out you can&#39;t attack people in the wilderness.
The wildy levels are there once you are over the ditch and so is the attack option, it just doesn&#39;t work.
I need to find a way to make attacking work in the wild.

If the question is not clear feel free to add bosmansyentl@hotmail.com and I&#39;ll show you what I mean.</description>
