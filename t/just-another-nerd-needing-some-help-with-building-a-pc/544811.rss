    <title>Just another nerd needing some help with building a PC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-another-nerd-needing-some-help-with-building-a-pc/544811</link>
    <description>So what I&#39;m wanting to do with said computer is high-end video editing. It needs to be able to handle rendering, editing,  intense 3D work and of course play games with ease. Over the months I&#39;ve put together around $1100NZD. Does anyone think I should keep saving in order to get the PC of my dreams? What parts and brands should I be looking to buy?

I really have no experience with choosing the best parts, because if it were up to me I would just buy what ever has the best price and reviews. But as I understand that some of you tech savy people like to have say in that. 

Any help is greatly appreciated.</description>

              <p>So I decided to buy my parts from New Zealand with the budget of one and half grand. Contacted someone at a webstore and he gave me these components. What do you guys think of them? Don’t have any links sorry.<br>

Your budget is 970 USD, an i7 4770k is going to take up not much less than half of that at $392. The 4770k supports up to 32GB of RAM, you’ll be wanting to use most of that since you’re into hardcore video editing. 4x8GB DDR3 Corsair Vengeance RAM sticks will set you back 275$ at the cheapest I could find. This takes you up to $667 total so far, leaving you with $303 for everything else.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty tight budget if you want a good video editing PC.</p>

Try iBUYPOWER pre-builds. Avoid AMD processors, use Intel, specifically i7 for those needs, ATI graphics card (otherwise nvidia), of course, it’s going to be a challenge, like Ashi said, really a small budget.<br>

<p>Why avoid AMD cpus?  For budget builds they are superior to Intel CPUs.[/quote]</p>
<p>Intel is just a more advanced processor for gaming. I do agree though, for a budget pc, going with Intel, especially seeing as you’re most likely going to go with an ivy bridge, you’re going to need a good cooling system due to the temperatures, so more money needs to be dropped.</p>

What I call high end isn’t in your budget.</p>
<p>Just use that pc part picker website, it’s really not that difficult.<br>

This is going to be my very first build and with the limited or next to no knowledge I have of hardware, I would like a little more assistance rather than just a finger towards another website, if possible please.</p>

<p>I’ve had a really bad experience with pre-built computers, they are either really bad and overpriced or they have a ton of software installed that is a pain and a half to remove without problems. My current computer is an in-all-one pre-built and its fine to a certain extent, but when it comes to editing or gaming it gets a bit frustrating. I’ve been looking around the web and I’ve come across <a href="http://nz.pcpartpicker.com/p/psbWf7" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this build</a>. Do you think it’ll do the job? I do realize that if I were to get an Intel Core that it should be an i7 because of something like multi threading according to some people. If you haven’t already noticed, I don’t really know what I’m talking about.[/quote]</p>
<p>You could run into many more horrible experiences building the computer yourself, however, whatever you decide on parts (of course after checking into them, making sure they’re all compatible, etc), you could always print the list, and take it to a local PC shop, order the parts, then have them build it for you. Always make sure to get a warranty.</p>

              <p>So what I’m wanting to do with said computer is high-end video editing. It needs to be able to handle rendering, editing,  intense 3D work and of course play games with ease. Over the months I’ve put together around $1100NZD. Does anyone think I should keep saving in order to get the PC of my dreams? What parts and brands should I be looking to buy?</p>
<p>I really have no experience with choosing the best parts, because if it were up to me I would just buy what ever has the best price and reviews. But as I understand that some of you tech savy people like to have say in that.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
