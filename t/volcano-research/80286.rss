    <description>I am researching Mt. Pinatubo 
we are supposed to make a presentation or something as an example as what happened. I made a flash volcano example [url=http://www.kloplop321.com/10lschuck/volcanoe.html]http://www.kloplop321.com/10lschuck/volcanoe.html[/url] change html to swf if you want it to be sized up. Tell me what you think of the volcanoes thingy, and a lot of it is actually math to generate all that stuff.

Wikipedia just isn&#39;t doing it for me, but I am having a hard time figuring out how to not plagiarize(dictionary suggestion) it, (for once, I am having trouble on a report) here are the questions. BTW, do not suggest to plagiarize, If I did, For 1, I get a zero, I get sent to alternative school for a week, and a bunch of other crap I don&#39;t want to deal with. My school is really strict on this. the teachers hate re-typing a lot of stuff into their web spider find a quote thingy.

Mt. Pinatubo Research
1: Give a complete description of the type of volcano.

2: Give a detailed account of the volcano&#39;s eruptive history.

3: Describe the effects the eruption had on each of the Earth&#39;s 4 subsystems. [sub]this means like the biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and atmosphere[/sub]

4: Give a detailed description of how the larars (mud flows) affected the area. [sub]I know that they eventually did more damage than the actual eruption, and mt. Pinatubo is on a tropical island with 9-month rain seasons.[/sub]

5: Discuss the problem of recurring mud flows during rainy seasons.

6:  Describe the general Climate of the Pinatubo area.
[sub]humid, has 9 month rainy seasons, lots of vegetation, things like that[/sub]
7: Describe the demographics of the area (populations, main sources of livelihood, financial resources available, etc.)

8: Describe the economic impact the eruption had on the area
[sub]people died.[/sub]
9:describe the global affects of the 1991 eruption.

And that is all.</description>
