    <description>i need some help with portforwarding, i already have a static IP: 77.165.89.36
i was almost sure i did it right, but now suddenly canyouseeme.org says: Error
i also need some some help getting my source and client to run via that IP and port: 43594
i use the base: Exion [PI]
so if you want to help me, please reply to this topic :)
i hope i gave enough information

oh yeah and
router: KPN experiabox ARV7519

i did work on the server, i made it a Quinten production like 70% was mine, but i fucked up (forgot to make back-up)
and now the server is 100% exion
i just want to make sure it can be played, then i will make it 70% Quinten again and then release it</description>

              <p>[quote=“Tutorial, post:2, topic:432872”]So you have done the following:</p>

<p>i have done all of that except the third, i didn’t understand a word you said <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
