    <description>How do i take away the Attack option when hovering over a player not in wildy but keep that option when in wildy on a 317 server. also for example if a player is lvl 5 and another is lvl 10 they have to b in 5+ wildy to fight, but once they fight they can continue fighting as they run through lower lvl wildy. how do i stop this??</description>
