    <title>Question about Bots</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-bots/79153</link>
    <description>Hi, I have a 24/7 web server/4EverScape server (down atm too many accounts overloaded it :(), but what i was wondering is if there are any bots (like RS-Demon) that can run on the computer WITHOUT actually opening the java window showing you what happened, as with all the other stuff running on this computer (to be honest it can barely handle java without that other stuff) it can&#39;t run a java applet. So, are there any bots (free or pay, pref. free) like RS-Demon that doesn&#39;t show the java window?
Oh yes and, has anyone (DaviDude36 did) bought a cd key for RS-Demon and would be able to tell me if its any good?
Thanks a lot,

Yeah I heard pplsuqbawlz got banned (or someone I forgot who) from using it (after they got to 60 woodcutting). I’m just using I-Bot now, but its pathetic… I tried to log into my character nd the computer was so slow for account name it just typed m00</p>
