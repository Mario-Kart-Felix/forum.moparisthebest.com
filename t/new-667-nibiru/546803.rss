    <title>[NEW] 667 Nibiru!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-667-nibiru/546803</link>
    <description>So I started this project about last week, and made a post on here trying to create a team.
I have 2 people who are currently trying to help me, and I&#39;m teaching one how to program now.
I still need 2 GFX artist, and a extra developer. So if you&#39;re interested please message me.
Anyways the server is coming along good, and if you didn&#39;t see my last post. Nibiru, my project is huge.
I plan to have it grow to become the best damn RSPS around everyone will remember, and that&#39;ll hopefully bring back alot of RSPS players and owners to the community. The server is currently in BETA, but is available for public use, while we touch it up to the finest anyone will have seen in awhile!

If you&#39;re interested come on in to the temp forums, register and download the client today! 
The server will be webclient ready also, for those who can&#39;t download. :)
