    <title>The simplest audio oscillator</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-simplest-audio-oscillator/293159</link>
    <description>Yeah... I left an important project to late and I need to make [i]the simplest[/i] audio oscillator from the least parts possible seeing as my collection of bits and pieces is in a total mess... It would be nice to not have to use more than two transistors (please... no pnp ones &gt;.&lt;) I only have polarized capacitors so please no non polarized capacitors. (&gt;.&lt;) I&#39;ll need to be able to hook it up to a 9v battery (always put a small resistor in the circuit) and I&#39;ll need to be able to hook it up to an 8Ohm speaker.

So yeah It would be nice to have a schematic before 3pm BST

Thanks in advance but if you can&#39;t help. Oh well  :rolleyes:


(Im going to bed now and... need to make a simple case as well so yeah busy day tommorow</description>

              <p>well, the simplest way would be to put a resistor and capacitor in series, it wouldn’t be a perfect sinewave, but seeing as you said you wanted it simple it should do.</p>
<p>the time it takes to complete a full wave would be 10 * C * R, so the frequency would be 1/10/C/R.<br>
I can’t remember the circuit diagram though, I will try and get back to you later.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 07, 2009, 10:05:25 am[/size][hr]ok, here’s a circuit closely resembling the one I was thinking of:<br>
