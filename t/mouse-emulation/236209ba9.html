        <p>Interesting. I see that you and I have something in common: Stream-of-Consciousness typing. It takes me a long time and quite a bit of editing to make my posts somewhat coherent.</p>
<p>That wasn’t a jab.</p>
<p>At any rate, I can see where you get the impression that I came across that way and it was not intentional. When I typed it, I didn’t it could have been taken any other way than the way I meant it. What I had meant was that there really is a way to inject code into the client and have it go completely unnoticed. I was assuming they don’t change anything drastic. The way I see it, all things are subject to stipulations. There are very few absolutes in life. Coding is even less certain. Of course they can detect injected code, but they would have to change something if they did. I believe I have my bases covered in that regard.</p>
<p>Pertaining to your question about whether I know the code enough to disengage their current graphics rendering safely: yes. I still have to work a bit more on tuning the system to run under 1% cpu constantly. My current bots run at an average of 4-8% with occasional spikes over 10.</p>
<p>The recording/playback feature is intriguing. Currently, though I don’t use a record/playback (though the idea sounds like something I would like to soon implement), I have a control panel that monitors all bots, the bots communicate asynchronously with the control panel and the control panel can start up, shut down, execute commands on bots, etc. My favorite part is the map that shows each and every bot as the minimap would in the game. The bots’ locations are updated in real-time. Hovering over the dots gives a tooltip with tidbits of info name/inventory items/current action/etc. Clicking on a dot will change the color of the dot and cause the bot to send small visual updates to the control panel in another pane. The update is slowish… only around 1-2 frames per second but it allows the random ethnic individual that is being paid peanuts to keep track of what the bot is doing visually. I’m thinking that I’ll be able to throw the record/playback functionality without too much pain.</p>
<p>Concerning why I do this. It is similar to your reasons for doing it. I started out just interested in tinkering with the game. I had just left diablo 2 hacking and got bored during some downtime at work. My reasons have changed since then, the only reason I continue to do it is for money.</p>

        <p>Hehe, it turned out that recording/playback was the most useful addition to my engine (ok, besides the engine itself). I was extremely useful in script debugging/development. Not only was I able do track down failures in the engine by having the scene playback in slow motion until I found the place where things went wrong (fast forward/arbitrary speed playback are your friend). I also had an easy time to implement “random events”: I just had to wait and cross fingers until one of my bots encountered an unknown event. In many cases, the recorded material was already enough to create a working counter-script. The benefit from this surpasses the effort of implementation <em>by far</em>. I’m surprised noone else had this idea to date.<br>
Based on that feature, there’s much more you can think of. I had bots running remotely on some linux boxes (without x-server), so I added a neat feature to connect to those clients from my desktop computer and watch the live action of the bot. Basically all I did was streaming the recorded data as it is generated to a playback client - only upon connection there was some delay due to initial synchronization with the bot. From there you could start/stop scripts, chat, or control the char (of course actions are ignored while a script is running in order not to interfere with the engines’ mouse events).</p>
<p>At one point I was also thinking about making some money out of this stuff, and I even started to write a “master script” that had bots systematically generate money by directing control flow to appropriate sub-scripts. Basically all that was needed, was to think of a good (not yet used!!!) character name, register it and start the bot. From there on, I never needed to care about it again, since it autonomously did tut island, raised needed levels, etc. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Ok, that was in the pre-Aryan era where people still thought such things as java bots don’t exist in “superior, unhackable” rs2, so people weren’t too suspicious <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Updating was as simple as typing “mkdir client330 &amp;&amp; cd client330 &amp;&amp; …/updateClient &amp;&amp; cd bot &amp;&amp; make deploy &amp;&amp; /somePath/launch_bots” (maybe also a “diff -ru bot/ …/client329/bot | less” to check the changes in the client).<br>
I only found it bothersome to get rid of the money with all those scammers around, so I disposed of the idea and had the guys going just for fun. There was a time when i owned the highscores in certain skills: in one skill, like 2/3 on the first page were my chars <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/cool1bce.png?v=6" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"><br>
Anyway, I wonder how much work my engine would need in order to get going again.</p>
<p>I think we should have joined our effords, the results probably would have been massive.</p>
<p>A small note slightly OnTopic:<br>
I wonder whether jagex considered the possibility of having a touch screen. Wouldn’t that render jagex’ mouse motion dectection mechanism totally useless?</p>
<p>(Edit: fixed numerous typos.)</p>

In my opinion you guys really do type too much.You would find majority of the boards users wouldn’t read such large paragraphs nor understand most of it.I myself prefer short statements which usually get the point across in a more direct and summarised manor.No offence dealt i hope.</p>
<p>On Topic: Interesting thought about touch screen, perhaps someone on the CM board will be able to test it.<br>

Hey, it’s the inside community boards, so that rules out all the newbs and n00bs. But you have a point, writing longs posts wastes too much time :)[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t see it as a waste of time, especially when people post great ideas in long posts, such as recording and playback of events such as you mentioned, that is really one of the best ideas I have ever heard. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
