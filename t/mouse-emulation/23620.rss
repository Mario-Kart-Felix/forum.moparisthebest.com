    <title>Mouse Emulation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mouse-emulation/23620</link>
    <description>I have a feeling that there are as many approaches to this as there are developers here, but I&#39;m still going to ask how everyone is handling mouse emulation. I know Aryan had none and ruler does some voodoo with the runtime library, but I&#39;m disinclined to take either route. My originally planned method was to write a layer for spoofing mouse events and allowing each script to set its own pathing algorithm. I just hacked up a proof, but it&#39;s probably full of holes. Comments? Alternatives? Fatal flaws?

[code]
/**
 * Spoofs mouse events to a specified Component.
 */

import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;
import java.util.Random;

public class MouseEmulator {
	
	private Component target;
	private int clickCount;
	
	public MouseEmulator(Component target) {
		this.target = target;
		clickCount = 1;	
	}
	
	/* Internal Event construction */
	
	//MouseEvent(Component source, int id, long when, int modifiers, int x,
	// 			 int y, int clickCount, boolean popupTrigger, int button) 
	private MouseEvent[] createLeftMouseClick(int x, int y) {		
		Random rand = new Random();
		
		MouseEvent pressed = new MouseEvent(target, MouseEvent.MOUSE_PRESSED, 
								System.currentTimeMillis(), MouseEvent.BUTTON1_MASK,
								x, y, clickCount, false, MouseEvent.BUTTON1);
		//lag var 47-219, usu 78-94; currently tends low		
		long releaseTime = System.currentTimeMillis() + rand.nextInt(100) + 40;
		MouseEvent released = new MouseEvent(target, MouseEvent.MOUSE_RELEASED, 
								releaseTime, MouseEvent.BUTTON1_MASK,
								x, y, clickCount, false, MouseEvent.BUTTON1);
								
		MouseEvent clicked = new MouseEvent(target, MouseEvent.MOUSE_CLICKED, 
								releaseTime, MouseEvent.BUTTON1_MASK,
								x, y, clickCount, false, MouseEvent.BUTTON1);
								
		MouseEvent[] clickEvents = new MouseEvent[]{pressed, released, clicked};
		return clickEvents;								
	}
	
	/* Public API */
	
	public void setClickCount(int count) {
		clickCount = count;
	}
	
	public void clickLeft(int x, int y) {
		MouseEvent[] events = createLeftMouseClick(x, y);		
		target.dispatchEvent(events[0]);
		target.dispatchEvent(events[1]);
		target.dispatchEvent(events[2]);
	}
}[/code]</description>

              <p>Hehe, it turned out that recording/playback was the most useful addition to my engine (ok, besides the engine itself). I was extremely useful in script debugging/development. Not only was I able do track down failures in the engine by having the scene playback in slow motion until I found the place where things went wrong (fast forward/arbitrary speed playback are your friend). I also had an easy time to implement “random events”: I just had to wait and cross fingers until one of my bots encountered an unknown event. In many cases, the recorded material was already enough to create a working counter-script. The benefit from this surpasses the effort of implementation <em>by far</em>. I’m surprised noone else had this idea to date.<br>
Based on that feature, there’s much more you can think of. I had bots running remotely on some linux boxes (without x-server), so I added a neat feature to connect to those clients from my desktop computer and watch the live action of the bot. Basically all I did was streaming the recorded data as it is generated to a playback client - only upon connection there was some delay due to initial synchronization with the bot. From there you could start/stop scripts, chat, or control the char (of course actions are ignored while a script is running in order not to interfere with the engines’ mouse events).</p>
<p>At one point I was also thinking about making some money out of this stuff, and I even started to write a “master script” that had bots systematically generate money by directing control flow to appropriate sub-scripts. Basically all that was needed, was to think of a good (not yet used!!!) character name, register it and start the bot. From there on, I never needed to care about it again, since it autonomously did tut island, raised needed levels, etc. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Ok, that was in the pre-Aryan era where people still thought such things as java bots don’t exist in “superior, unhackable” rs2, so people weren’t too suspicious <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Updating was as simple as typing “mkdir client330 &amp;&amp; cd client330 &amp;&amp; …/updateClient &amp;&amp; cd bot &amp;&amp; make deploy &amp;&amp; /somePath/launch_bots” (maybe also a “diff -ru bot/ …/client329/bot | less” to check the changes in the client).<br>
I only found it bothersome to get rid of the money with all those scammers around, so I disposed of the idea and had the guys going just for fun. There was a time when i owned the highscores in certain skills: in one skill, like 2/3 on the first page were my chars <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=6" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"><br>
Anyway, I wonder how much work my engine would need in order to get going again.</p>
<p>I think we should have joined our effords, the results probably would have been massive.</p>
<p>A small note slightly OnTopic:<br>
I wonder whether jagex considered the possibility of having a touch screen. Wouldn’t that render jagex’ mouse motion dectection mechanism totally useless?</p>

              <p>Interesting. I see that you and I have something in common: Stream-of-Consciousness typing. It takes me a long time and quite a bit of editing to make my posts somewhat coherent.</p>
<p>That wasn’t a jab.</p>
<p>At any rate, I can see where you get the impression that I came across that way and it was not intentional. When I typed it, I didn’t it could have been taken any other way than the way I meant it. What I had meant was that there really is a way to inject code into the client and have it go completely unnoticed. I was assuming they don’t change anything drastic. The way I see it, all things are subject to stipulations. There are very few absolutes in life. Coding is even less certain. Of course they can detect injected code, but they would have to change something if they did. I believe I have my bases covered in that regard.</p>
<p>Pertaining to your question about whether I know the code enough to disengage their current graphics rendering safely: yes. I still have to work a bit more on tuning the system to run under 1% cpu constantly. My current bots run at an average of 4-8% with occasional spikes over 10.</p>
<p>The recording/playback feature is intriguing. Currently, though I don’t use a record/playback (though the idea sounds like something I would like to soon implement), I have a control panel that monitors all bots, the bots communicate asynchronously with the control panel and the control panel can start up, shut down, execute commands on bots, etc. My favorite part is the map that shows each and every bot as the minimap would in the game. The bots’ locations are updated in real-time. Hovering over the dots gives a tooltip with tidbits of info name/inventory items/current action/etc. Clicking on a dot will change the color of the dot and cause the bot to send small visual updates to the control panel in another pane. The update is slowish… only around 1-2 frames per second but it allows the random ethnic individual that is being paid peanuts to keep track of what the bot is doing visually. I’m thinking that I’ll be able to throw the record/playback functionality without too much pain.</p>
<p>Concerning why I do this. It is similar to your reasons for doing it. I started out just interested in tinkering with the game. I had just left diablo 2 hacking and got bored during some downtime at work. My reasons have changed since then, the only reason I continue to do it is for money.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with editing the client, as long as you know what you are doing. Anyone that says otherwise, is just really saying that they don’t know how to do it right.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I cannot agree with that in either case.<br>
Editing the client is possible and not too hard if you have enough experience and patience. I followed this sheme for a very long time, basically it was my only way of doing things. But one could aswell state that “There is nothing wrong with packet sending, as long as you know what you are doing”. Ok, not really a good comparison due to the greatly increased complexity of latter approach. I mean, your statement implies that there are no other ways, maybe even better. What happens if jagex decides one day to recode their protection or even just introduces a new trap. Do you go through the code every time to check what they have done? Maybe your system is good enough that there’s only very few situations where engine interferes with the client and in the worst case it will just not work anymore.<br>
Wouldn’t it be great to have an universal engine that would plug into any client, insensitive to any protection mechanisms that are coded around the client core. Of course, such a system will not survive a (partial) rewrite of the client (like rs -&gt; rs2). Still, refraining from direct interference with the client will avoid a lot of hassle with traps and other protections put into place. I’m not saying such a sheme is trivial or even realistic to implement, but if I ever will come back to this again my research is surely going into this direction.<br>
Anyway, as mentioned I followed the former way for a long time and things started to get boring and cumbersome at one point. I had very robust routines and almost fully automated updating mechanism, basically I only had to manully go through the diff between clients and now and then required treatment of some “special packets”. My system required this due to the nice features it had. For example it had a no-graphics mode which lowered CPU usage to ~1% even on moderate machines (Athlon 700Mhz). Maybe you know the code good enough such that you know which trap in the rendering code I’m talking about.<br>
Just saying, eventually it’s a good idea to try some new concepts. At least for me, I’m not doing this to get “useless stuff”, but in order to learn something, try “something”, just to see what happens. I always enjoyed using my engine to send out my creations into the virtual world in order to do something interesting and the excitement when checking your log files the next day and to see what funny situations they were involved in <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I even had a nice recording/playback system coded in (which actually is rather trivial to implement - just overide the stream class to dump the incoming data and also store some meta data for proper synchronisation and if you whish also the user input) and I still have GBs of records on some backup disks. Afaik 1Mb gives you about 2h 100% accurate playback with camera movement and mouse motion/clicks.<br>
To summarize, this is (was) <em>my</em> way of playing runescape :)))</p>

If you write a decent enough method, it should be somewhat identical to a real click</p>

<p>Krichevskoy, back on topic, I am implementing this class, heavily edited, into my bot, and in doing so I have discovered a flaw in it, printing out the mouseevents of your class with a click count of 2 just sends one set of mouse events</p>

<p>Well, I could act like I know what I’m doing and say that the intended usage is</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">emu.clickLeft(x,y);
emu.setClickCount(2);
emu.clickLeft(x,y);</code></pre>
<p>but that would be stupid and, honestly, I wasn’t thinking about usage at all when I added the click count setter - I just thought “Hey, a variable. That needs some public access.”</p>

<p>Thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
That, too, was something I thought of in the thirty seconds before I posted  - actually I haven’t designed anything that far in advance of myself. However, it would allow scripters to use whatever level of mouse pathing they are competent enough to create (I’m sure that some stock implementations of, say, cubic splines would be written soon enough for anyone else). If the scripter himself uses an open design, particularly concerned people might be able to generate their own average-behaviour pathing equations or add in little quirks that they’ve noticed in their actual mouse movements.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">mousePressed: java.awt.event.MouseEvent[MOUSE_PRESSED,(649,253),button=1,modifiers=Button1,extModifiers=Button1,clickCount=2] on panel0
mouseReleased: java.awt.event.MouseEvent[MOUSE_RELEASED,(649,253),button=1,modifiers=Button1,clickCount=2] on panel0
mouseClicked: java.awt.event.MouseEvent[MOUSE_CLICKED,(649,253),button=1,modifiers=Button1,clickCount=2] on panel0</code></pre>
<p>but if you double click on the window manually with a real mouse, you get this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mousePressed: java.awt.event.MouseEvent[MOUSE_PRESSED,(649,253),button=1,modifiers=Button1,extModifiers=Button1,clickCount=1] on panel0
mouseReleased: java.awt.event.MouseEvent[MOUSE_RELEASED,(649,253),button=1,modifiers=Button1,clickCount=1] on panel0
mouseClicked: java.awt.event.MouseEvent[MOUSE_CLICKED,(649,253),button=1,modifiers=Button1,clickCount=1] on panel0
mousePressed: java.awt.event.MouseEvent[MOUSE_PRESSED,(649,253),button=1,modifiers=Button1,extModifiers=Button1,clickCount=2] on panel0
mouseReleased: java.awt.event.MouseEvent[MOUSE_RELEASED,(649,253),button=1,modifiers=Button1,clickCount=2] on panel0
mouseClicked: java.awt.event.MouseEvent[MOUSE_CLICKED,(649,253),button=1,modifiers=Button1,clickCount=2] on panel0</code></pre>
<p>so unless you were planning on sending a two in a row of these you need to implement a simple for loop.</p>
<p>When I get this class done I will post it, well the whole bot will be open source, so w/e <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I disagree completely. I can see how most would think that way though. Code Injection, when done improperly, can be very dangerous. But, doing it right, is safe as any of the other ‘methodology’ this community endorses.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with editing the client, as long as you know what you are doing. Anyone that says otherwise, is just really saying that they don’t know how to do it right.</p>
