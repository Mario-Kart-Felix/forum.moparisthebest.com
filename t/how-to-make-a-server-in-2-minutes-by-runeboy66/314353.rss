    <title>How to make a server in 2 minutes - by runeboy66</title>

    <description>Well, YOU may think this sucks and SOME people might think this is helpful, if you have nothing nice to say to me then leave my tut, its simple.
so lots of people want a server dont they and they want it 24/7 well this is a way you can do it in 2 minutes.^^as my title says...^^
So I guess you have WinRaR and JDK or JRE, if you don&#39;t google them.
Anyway I am now going to explain the process..
This tut is works for all deobs, 317, 508, 474, 525 ect.. But the main part of a server is the source, go to this link to find one: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html
If there are no servers on the first page use the second, third and so on..
The thing to set your network &quot;hamachi&quot; this is used so people can connect to your ip, and the ip set to your hamachi is how you register a ip like a .no-ip.biz, .org or .info which are the most popular.
to download hamachi if you dont already have it go to this website: http://hamachi.en.softonic.com/
This takes about 2 seconds to download and then about 1 minute to install... anyway once you have downloaded it and you have downloaded a source go to this website : Http://www.no-ip.com/
and register a account. [IMG]http://i623.photobucket.com/albums/tt311/Jack123_photos/no-ip.jpg[/img]
Now open hamachi up and when it loads click network&gt;Create network&gt;choose what you want your network name and pass i going to be&gt;click ok! Right your nearly done, just a few more things, email, call, tell, show your friends how to download hamachi and then get them to join your network of course they need a ip changer or a client if you have one so give them the links and so on..
Now run your source log in and make your self owner if you dont know how ask me via comment or pm.
Ok so you dont have a cool ip that makes people want to join so what you do is this go to your no-ip.com acc and click create a host then type in your requested ip and then you should see a ip bit near the bottom it will have you ip in it remove that and type the hamachi ip if you dont know what this is open up hamachi *note* this has to be opened when your server is on, and remove the ip in the box on no-ip then type in your hamachi one then scroll down and click ok! now once your friends have joined your network and your server is running tell them your ip and your done, it will not be 24/7 inless you leave your computer on 24/7 =) hope you like my tut its my first one. please comment and tell me how i did!!!! ty
