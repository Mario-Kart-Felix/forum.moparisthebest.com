    <title>Unable to wrap my head around Bonds</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unable-to-wrap-my-head-around-bonds/546598</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t really played hardcore since the release of EoC, so I am still at a loss as to what half of the new stuff is in the game.

How exactly do bonds work? I looked them up on the Grand Exchange and it says they&#39;re ~5.7 mill. Does this mean I could buy a bond, get a month of membership, and in that month of membership I could make 5.7m again and pay for another bond and keep paying for my membership through bonds, thus never paying out of pocket?</description>

<p>Well depending on your slayer you could try Rorarius, you can make an easy 3-4m an hour there. You need 81 slayer to kill those. You don’t really need much in terms of gear or potions either.<br>

So if I had like 90 range and 81 slayer I would be able to handle them?[/quote]<br>
Easily, soul split or deflect magic to prolong your trip.</p>

Any of the higher level bosses are decent, otherwise you’ll probably have to skill for most of your time to make back the money. I take back what I said about it only being a couple of hours for 1 bond. Frost bones crashed pretty hard so it will take about a half day</p>
