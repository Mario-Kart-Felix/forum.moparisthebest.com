    <title>How has programming affected you?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-has-programming-affected-you/546684</link>
    <description>I&#39;m curious to know if all of you programmers have thought that it has been worth it to learn all of your knowledge. This is a serious question. I&#39;m basically wondering if I should go to college for this and make it a career. You probably think if I want to do it then just do it or something, but that&#39;s not really why I am asking. Here&#39;s a few questions if you guys could answer.

1. Has your time been worth it?
2. How many languages do you know?
3. What have you achieved from everything you have been through?
4. How long has it taken to be where you are today?
5. Would you recommend this as a career or more of a hobby?
6. Ups and downs maybe?

Thank you.</description>

<li>Has your time been worth it?<br>
Sure has, it is a very useful skill to have.</li>
<li>How many languages do you know?<br>
A couple (C and Java are my favourite languages and I have gotten quite good at them over the last 9 years. I have also done some programming in BASIC dialects in the past, at the moment I am also working on learning 80386 assembly and 68000 assembly)</li>
<li>What have you achieved from everything you have been through?<br>
Not much in the real world unfortunately (Besides some one-off freelance jobs and some CS olympiad successes)</li>
<li>How long has it taken to be where you are today?<br>
Roughly 9-11 years, I first started programming in basic when I was 9 years old and I got into RSPS at 11</li>
<li>Would you recommend this as a career or more of a hobby?<br>
Depends on you as a person, I don’t want it as a career because I just wouldn’t want to be mashing on a keyboard for the next X years of my life, I am going to study Physics next year, even more math and actual interesting areas of research…</li>
<li>Ups and downs maybe?<br>
see 5</li>

True, learning Math is essentially the same as learning programming. (Same learning concepts apply, it’s all logic situations).</p>

<p>You mainly need maths if you’re planning on becoming a game developer or something. Making other applications does not require much complex maths.</p>

              <p>I’m in my 3rd week of studying computing: Software development in College where we’ve been learning everything from Computing based Maths, Database Design(sql), web development and the language we use for general software development is c# and it’s extremely fascinating. If you aren’t too annoyed by maths and problem solving and being creative in general then I’d advise this. Not only is this a fantastic career to branch into because you’ll basically never be out of a job. You should only really do it if you enjoy it, though.</p>
<p>My plans are to finish this year and then go on to do a degree in Computer Science next year.</p>
<ol>
<li>I’ve been tinkering around with programming languages for some-time just for fun, really. Then I decided to learn JAVA and that got me hooked and very interested in the computer science field. So, yeah.</li>
<li>I know JAVA and C# well. However, like I said I’ve tinkered with all sorts of languages.</li>
<li>It has got me onto an education path in which I find interesting and basically getting things working after pulling your hair our for ages is highly rewarding! Plus, people think you’re a Wizard <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">
</li>
<li>I’ve been doing this since I was 15 and I’m now 18.</li>
<li>It really depends if you want your career to creative but also difficult and understand that it will require you to spend a lot of time in front of a Computer.</li>
<li>It can get you highly aggressive whilst trying to solve a problem but after you figure it out it makes you feel great <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
</li>
</ol>
<p>The only piece of advice that will truly help is this: Don’t go on YouTube to try and learn a language. Yes, they’re good for getting down the basics but often weighs you down with dodgy coding practises and layouts, you would be best served buying a book -  books are boring, I know. Fastest way to learn, though.</p>

<li>Has your time been worth it?</li>

<p>Yes it has because it has greatly improved my problem-solving skills and the way I analyze problems. It’s also given me knowledge on something that is ubiquitous in this day and age and that is something I believe is truly valuable (think about the people who don’t even know how to use a printer…).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How many languages do you know?</li>

<p>Almost a dozen, and that’s because I really enjoy learning new languages. Each language has its different strengths and weaknesses while they all allow you to program in different ways.</p>

<li>Would you recommend this as a career or more of a hobby?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it comes down to your own personal preference. CS is one of the best jobs to have these days because of the salary and the demand for more software engineers. Most likely a lot of people will be using what you built so I think that’s empowering in itself. If you can’t see yourself programming and solving these kinds of problems everyday and making it into a career, don’t do it.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Ups and downs maybe?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ups: improving your problem-solving and analytical skills, salary, programming (hopefully you find this fun and exciting), being a part of an accelerating industry, making people’s lives today better by solving problems or making things easier, possibly perks if you work at a nice company, startups.</p>
<p>Downs: stressful, fast-paced, sitting on your ass for most of the day.</p>

              <p>Do you have the motivation?  Do you enjoy and are strong in mathematics?  Do you see problems in the world that can be solved with programming?</p>
<p>My personal experience is a little odd.  I was never really good at programming, but it has interested me since I joined Kaitnieks (2003?).  I’ve been attempting to teach myself since then.  Learning a language’s syntax is easy.  Learning programming/theory is where I get stuck.  I’ve probably done more drugs than necessary in the past couple of years <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<ol>
<li>Even if I have a hard time applying what knowledge I do have, a learning experience is always worth it.  I have had a couple brief successes, but nothing that was really impressive.</li>
<li>A couple.  Java, PHP, Ruby.  But knowing a language means nothing if you don’t know other tools, such as: databases, markup languages, etc.</li>
<li>I’ve made a little bit of money here and there.  Mostly just personal accomplishments though.</li>
<li>All my life, I would assume.</li>
<li>I’d recommend it being a hobby because hobbies are generally for fun.  If you make it fun, you’ll probably enjoy it more.</li>
<li>You’re a fuckin’ nerd (both up and down)</li>

<p>Q <span class="hashtag">#2</span>. How many languages do you know?<br>
A <span class="hashtag">#2</span>. I know a few languages very well, but have programmed in many more. I have no exact numbers, though.</p>
<p>Q <span class="hashtag">#3</span>. What have you achieved from everything you have been through?<br>
A <span class="hashtag">#3</span>. I have had a lot of fun and worked for a few different companies, which isn’t that fun.</p>
<p>Q <span class="hashtag">#4</span>. How long has it taken to be where you are today?<br>
A <span class="hashtag">#4</span>. Around 10 years or so.</p>
<p>Q <span class="hashtag">#5</span>. Would you recommend this as a career or more of a hobby?<br>
Q <span class="hashtag">#5</span>. I see it as both a hobby and a career. Although I wish I could live on my hobby projects. But I currently cannot.</p>
<p>Q <span class="hashtag">#6</span>. Ups and downs maybe?<br>
A <span class="hashtag">#6</span>. Ups would be that programming is a fun and creative process. Downs would be that it takes a lot of time and dedication. Not to mention, you would sit in front of a computer screen a lot.</p>

I’m basically wondering if I should go to college for this and make it a career. You probably think if I want to do it then just do it or something, but that’s not really why I am asking.
