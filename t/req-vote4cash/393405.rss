    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-vote4cash/393405</link>
    <description>ive owned my server for about 6 months now and its starting to pick up, yet my votes are just now getting to the 1000&#39;s

and i see these other server with vote4cash fly right past me in vote in notime lol

so i was wondering if anyone could please help me via tv or something to set up a vote4cash system

yes i have used the tuts here but can never get the mysql part with hostgator done because i really suck at the website stuff.
