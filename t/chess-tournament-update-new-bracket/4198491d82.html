<p>(You said you played chess without learning tricks for a long time.)[/quote]Actually learning the tactics helped a lot, as for win rate, I have no idea.  It makes finding moves (for your opponent and self) much easier and faster; it also makes your play much stronger when you actually know what to look for.</p>

<p>If you do look at it, the turning point is around move 12/13+[/quote]That opening looked odd, so I decided to go over the game and share my notes…</p>
<p>The first thing I notice is:<br>
5. Nh3 seems like a mistake, but black didn’t capitalize on it with Nd4 and payed the price for the slow-play.  The move was still there for a few moves, even after you did Qb3.</p>
<p>But before that, you played 3. Qf3.  The common, and better move (IMO and based on a few engines) is Qd1, but I see where you’re coming from with Qf3 (especially because it seems counter-productive and wasteful).</p>
<p>I’d have to say black had bad play from 10. Be6 to 14. Nxg5, which really gave you the game.</p>
<p>You would have just cleaned house if you didn’t do 18. Qxb7, which was a pretty big mistake (wasn’t devastating, but was still pretty big).</p>
<p>Also, you should have kept the tension at 25. Nxd7, and dealt with the pawn situations before taking.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of tiny things that I didn’t take note of, but they weren’t anything major IMO.</p>

<p>Also, I’d just like to say it’s a lot easier to have 20-20 hindsight than it is under pressure.[/quote]Run the position with Nd4 as the last move a couple dozen times in an engine vs engine match…  I did it with Rybka 3 as both sides and black won every time.  Also, Nd4 is an awesome move.  Here is why:<br>
Takes center board control.<br>
Forces you to waste a move.<br>
Puts pressure on c2.</p>
<p>Your best move (from what I can tell with some engine analysis) is Qd1 after Nd4.  Also, many times position is more important that material.  Letting black have tempo, position, and tons of room is very dangerous.</p>
<p>I was saying Qd1 seems wasteful, which is why most players won’t do it.<br>
4. Qd1 Nf6<br>
5. Nc3 Bg7<br>
That seems like a better position than:<br>
4. Qf3 Nf6<br>
5. Nh3 Nd4</p>
<p>There are a few reason…<br>
Your line is losing because of Nd4.<br>
After 6. Qd1 you’re an additional move behind.<br>
You’re becoming cramped.<br>
Black has dominant position here.  Tons of room, decent development, can quickly be fully developed.<br>
Your knight on h3 is doing very, very little.  It would be much stronger if there was more going on, but there isn’t.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Nc3 would be my move.  It saves the rook, develops a piece, connects the rooks, and puts pressure on the center.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ya, I know full well how different it is OTB vs analysis.  But like I said, I was just posting my notes.</p>

        <p>Err… can’t tell if you’re trolling here, but running any sort of engine to develop a game from move 5 is kinda meaningless. Both have many different moves they can make from that point on, it really has nothing to do with one move that early in the game. That’s like running the engine from move two and seeing which starting move makes you win every time. Yea… no. And your points are contradictory anyways. How is it ‘wasting a move’, if you’re covering C2 and moving the queen out of (any) pressure at the same time? Not to mention his center ‘control’ means bubkus, he literally has an unprotected pawn covering that space, meaning I could have moved any of my pawns to put HIM under pressure again.</p>
<p>Again your points contradict here… moving my queen further back one not only puts me into a more cramped position, but is still under pressure if he decides to move his Nd4. Not only that, it limits my moves into the center of the board (and you keep saying the center board control is what his moves would have done…?), which I needed when covering my bishop to go ahead and eventually take his queen with it. Without that move, I would have probably lost.</p>
<p>18 - Like I said, I saw the move and knew exactly how I could have stopped it, but I wanted to take his knight. In the end it worked out for me, so it’s hard to say without a time machine what keeping my rook and letting him keep his knight would have meant. The knight is literally the only piece that can pressure the queen without a piece protecting it, and as I was behind enemy lines by myself I didn’t want to take that risk.</p>
<p>Honestly you’re taking it one move at a time in this analysis instead of thinking further into the game.</p>
<p>Anyway… enough of that. Scarecrows and I decided to probably not play today, as it’ll be busy (new years stuff) and hard to find a time we’ll both be on for a reasonable amount of time.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:476, topic:419849”]Err… can’t tell if you’re trolling here, but running any sort of engine to develop a game from move 5 is kinda meaningless. Both have many different moves they can make from that point on, it really has nothing to do with one move that early in the game. That’s like running the engine from move two and seeing which starting move makes you win every time. Yea… no. And your points are contradictory anyways. How is it ‘wasting a move’, if you’re covering C2 and moving the queen out of (any) pressure at the same time? Not to mention his center ‘control’ means bubkus, he literally has an unprotected pawn covering that space, meaning I could have moved any of my pawns to put HIM under pressure again.</p>
<p>Again your points contradict here… moving my queen further back one not only puts me into a more cramped position, but is still under pressure if he decides to move his Nd4. Not only that, it limits my moves into the center of the board (and you keep saying the center board control is what his moves would have done…?), which I needed when covering my bishop to go ahead and eventually take his queen with it. Without that move, I would have probably lost.</p>

<p>I can play now if you can, hopefully finish it off before I have to go!</p>

Scarecrows and I decided to probably not play today, as it’ll be busy (new years stuff) and hard to find a time we’ll both be on for a reasonable amount of time.[/quote]It is not meaningless.  When you run enough games through, and every single game black wins there was a massive flaw somewhere beforehand.  Identifying it isn’t that hard…  Your argument would be valid if it wasn’t a statistically significant difference, and there wasn’t such obvious mistakes made.</p>
<p>Do you know about time in chess, and I don’t mean what’s on the clock?  Wasting a move wins and loses games at every level.  White starts with the time advantage, which is why at the highest level black has to fight to even draw.  You’re also looking at that current move, which is not nearly as important as the next 4-5 moves and on (many times the best move is determined by the position 15+ moves later).</p>
<p>Center board control is a very important part, especially with that play style, if you were playing in a hypermodern manner, then your argument could be valid, but you’re not.  And again, you’re looking at a depth of a single half-move, not the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Pulling your queen back saves time, and you can develop another piece, which can control the center…  Look at the line I suggested.  Your original move is much weaker the further ahead you look, so your argument is null there.  The only way it can be seen as stronger is if you look at a depth of 1-2 half-steps.</p>
<p>Move 18 was bad, why can’t you just admit it, rather than trying to justify it with feelings?  I’m not trying to attack your play, I’m just offering notes, and letting you know weaknesses that I saw.</p>
<p>“Honestly you’re taking it one move at a time in this analysis instead of thinking further into the game.”  That is so ironic…  I’ve been going at least 10 full moves per, and the engines have been going 17-25 moves.  I’ve spent quite a few hours on this game as well, how thorough has your analysis been?</p>
<p>Like always, you can not accept suggestions, or any criticism while resorting to arguments based on how you feel rather than substance.  Anyway, I’m done trying to help you, as you’re just being thick-headed.  If you’d like to continue arguing, I’ll gladly defend everything I’ve said; though, unlike you, if I’m proven wrong I’ll admit it.</p>
<p>Anyway, goodluck in the tourney; I hope we can meet each other for the final round ;).</p>
