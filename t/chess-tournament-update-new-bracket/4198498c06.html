Err… can’t tell if you’re trolling here, but running any sort of engine to develop a game from move 5 is kinda meaningless. Both have many different moves they can make from that point on, it really has nothing to do with one move that early in the game. That’s like running the engine from move two and seeing which starting move makes you win every time. Yea… no. And your points are contradictory anyways. How is it ‘wasting a move’, if you’re covering C2 and moving the queen out of (any) pressure at the same time? Not to mention his center ‘control’ means bubkus, he literally has an unprotected pawn covering that space, meaning I could have moved any of my pawns to put HIM under pressure again.</p>
<p>Again your points contradict here… moving my queen further back one not only puts me into a more cramped position, but is still under pressure if he decides to move his Nd4. Not only that, it limits my moves into the center of the board (and you keep saying the center board control is what his moves would have done…?), which I needed when covering my bishop to go ahead and eventually take his queen with it. Without that move, I would have probably lost.</p>
<p>18 - Like I said, I saw the move and knew exactly how I could have stopped it, but I wanted to take his knight. In the end it worked out for me, so it’s hard to say without a time machine what keeping my rook and letting him keep his knight would have meant. The knight is literally the only piece that can pressure the queen without a piece protecting it, and as I was behind enemy lines by myself I didn’t want to take that risk.</p>
<p>Honestly you’re taking it one move at a time in this analysis instead of thinking further into the game.</p>
<p>Anyway… enough of that. Scarecrows and I decided to probably not play today, as it’ll be busy (new years stuff) and hard to find a time we’ll both be on for a reasonable amount of time.<br>
[/quote]It is not meaningless.  When you run enough games through, and every single game black wins there was a massive flaw somewhere beforehand.  Identifying it isn’t that hard…  Your argument would be valid if it wasn’t a statistically significant difference, and there wasn’t such obvious mistakes made.</p>
<p>Do you know about time in chess, and I don’t mean what’s on the clock?  Wasting a move wins and loses games at every level.  White starts with the time advantage, which is why at the highest level black has to fight to even draw.  You’re also looking at that current move, which is not nearly as important as the next 4-5 moves and on (many times the best move is determined by the position 15+ moves later).</p>
<p>Center board control is a very important part, especially with that play style, if you were playing in a hypermodern manner, then your argument could be valid, but you’re not.  And again, you’re looking at a depth of a single half-move, not the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Pulling your queen back saves time, and you can develop another piece, which can control the center…  Look at the line I suggested.  Your original move is much weaker the further ahead you look, so your argument is null there.  The only way it can be seen as stronger is if you look at a depth of 1-2 half-steps.</p>
<p>Move 18 was bad, why can’t you just admit it, rather than trying to justify it with feelings?  I’m not trying to attack your play, I’m just offering notes, and letting you know weaknesses that I saw.</p>
<p>“Honestly you’re taking it one move at a time in this analysis instead of thinking further into the game.”  That is so ironic…  I’ve been going at least 10 full moves per, and the engines have been going 17-25 moves.  I’ve spent quite a few hours on this game as well, how thorough has your analysis been?</p>
<p>Like always, you can not accept suggestions, or any criticism while resorting to arguments based on how you feel rather than substance.  Anyway, I’m done trying to help you, as you’re just being thick-headed.  If you’d like to continue arguing, I’ll gladly defend everything I’ve said; though, unlike you, if I’m proven wrong I’ll admit it.[/quote]It’s meaningless because I won. You could run millions or billions or trillions of robots going at the same time and get the same result with black winning each game, and it would still be meaningless. If you understand that, then you can understand chess. If not, you’re just a robot looking at the statistics that can easily make a mistake when playing a real person because they make a move you didn’t see (even if it was a bad move that ruins a plan you had). I play humans, which means trying to analyze each move for value is counterproductive on the clock and in the long run, long plans can be foiled by one move. I never look more than 3-4 moves ahead in-game, not only can it get confusing but it’s a waste of time depending on what they do. With robots playing robots its different.</p>
<p>Again, I won. If you think the turn is ‘wasted’, you are incorrect, because if I had done something else, he may have done something else (like not moved his knight out), and then the entire game would have played differently, in which case the rest of your analysis is null. This is another reason I think robots are a terrible judge for how games can play out. Unless both humans are exactly the same skill level and playing type, one move by the opponent you didn’t predict will change the rest of the game, and your evaluations become literally wasted brain energy.</p>
<p>Was move 18 bad? It’s a good question, one that can only be answered with a time machine. Did I lose points on it? Absolutely. Do I think it was worth it? Absolutely. Would I make the same move again? Ab-so-fucking-lutely. Again, had he kept his knight, the entire game would have played out differently. I may have won by more points, or I may have lost the match. I still won, so you can call it a bad move all you want, but in the end it means nothing.</p>
<p>My analysis has been 0 minutes. I don’t usually spend time going over games I win afterwards unless someone is going to try and argue I played incorrectly, in which case I will glady explain why I made each move, and then explain how that move caused me to win the game <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Of course there are moves I think I made were incorrect (not in hindsight mind you, but before I won), but each of those moves changed the outcome of the game to cause my win. (I feel like this is hard to put into words, but if you understand it… I hope you get the point) I’m not saying I could make the same mistakes and win again, but in this case I do not regret making them. And like I said before, engine vs engine means nothing, nor does going ahead that far into the game without thinking of EVERY possible outcome, which we don’t have the time to do.</p>
<p>To be honest you should be helping Scarecrows, as they say, a loss is a learning opportunity. Winning just tells me that what I did was right. Go ahead and think that makes me wrong and you right, but it just shows your arrogance in the mundane… (Not saying I’m not just as bad, I think it’s obvious to everyone we’re both arrogant) I’ll gladly discuss my incorrect moves with you when I next lose a game.</p>
<p>EDIT - This really relates to life. Every decision we make affects our future, and the future is going to play out differently based on those choices. You can’t predict what’s going to happen; life, nature, and humanity will always have curveballs to throw at you. You can do your best to plan it out, and sometimes it may work out just like you planned it (perhaps with some detours), but most of the time, you’re wasting your life away planning instead of living. Sorry for the tangent there.</p>
<p>Happy new years, party time. Scarecrows, let’s play tomorrow, yes?</p>

Just because you won doesn’t mean it was because of something you did or didn’t do.  It also doesn’t mean you can’t improve, or should have done something differently.  Ask any great chess player which games should be analyzed most (wins, losses, or draws)…  Several have said they study the mistakes they made in their wins harder than any other game, because mistakes in losses and draws are usually easier to spot/correct.  Mistakes in your wins are much harder to spot and correct, and your opponents will be analyzing those the most.</p>
<p>That being said, all your arguments based on ‘well, I won’ are completely invalid.  Time management is an art.  You need to know how your opponent thinks, and also prepare for them to play their best possible move.  Every good chess resource says you should assume your opponent plays the best move, that way you’re always prepared for the worst.  While thinking about the best move, you’ll very often stumble upon the lines your opponent has thought about, so it’s not a total loss, as you’ve already figured out the weakness of that line during your evaluation.</p>
<p>Again, you’re thinking that people make arbitrary and random moves, that are not calculated; which is as far from the truth as one can get.  Also, any alternative move is inferior, and <span class="bbcode-b">better</span> for you, that’s the whole point of finding the best move…</p>
<p>No, the question has already been answered.  18 was a bad move, end of discussion.  It put your opponent in a much more comfortable situation.  Many people make stupid mistakes like that when they’re up, and lose the game because of it (I’ve seen it many, many times; I’ve also done it quite a few times).  With the mentality of making inferior moves because you feel like it you’ll never improve, especially when you refuse to correct your errors because you were lucky enough to win.</p>
<p>It seems like you’re hinting at a set destiny type universe, and that if you made another move you would have changed said destiny, so you don’t like to disturb it.  While I understand that view, it’s still not the correct way to become a better player.</p>
<p>You’re also saying it’s pure engine vs engine, which it’s not.  I’ve been going over lesser moves as well, because that’s how you should be analyzing the game.  Furthermore, every possible combination does not need to be covered…  Look into how chess engines work for more information.  The possibilities are greatly reduced because many moves are bad and don’t need to be considered at that time; when the bad moves are made then they can be acted up.</p>
<p>Winning is the biggest learning opportunity (losing reveals the most obvious and serious flaws), and it doesn’t tell you everything you did was right.  All it tells you is that you didn’t make as many/bad of mistakes as your opponent.</p>
<p>Chess isn’t a game of chance…  If this was a luck based game, then I’d tend to agree with you, but every move can be quantified, and all possibilities can be covered (most moves can be discarded because they are obviously bad, and will end in a loss).  If you really start diving into chess this will become obvious.</p>
<p>Also, I’d be glad to play you for fun, and give us a game to analyze.  Would be a fun way to start the new year.</p>

<p>Seriously CFF, it just becomes pointless to ever argue with you, so I decided to stop before it goes on forever (because with you I know it would). Just learn to stop arguing. I mean seriously, we were doing almost page long replies about whether or not chess moves I made were bad. Pretty sad. I didn’t even read your latest reply because I had to go to a party.</p>
