    <title>Barter or Money?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/barter-or-money/229201</link>
    <description>Barter or Money?
What would you rather have?
For the numnuts:
Bartering is more or less trading stuff for other stuff. Everyone gets what they want with no screwups. There is no set currency.

Example, if you want to barter for a Pie, you may offer a chunk of meat, however, offering a sword or such would not be of much use to the other person. They could then trade the sword on for a whole cow if they are lucky. Hence getting 200 pies out of 1.

Pros: Bartering may get you a lot more than you bargained for.
Cons: It may go bad and you loose lots.


Money is more or less a means of trading one object for another (set) object, which has the same value to all people.

Example, if you want to buy a pie, you go into a store and hand over $2 or something. The other person can then buy more materials for making pies. Hence limiting them to about 3 new pies to each one sold.

Pros: Money is not dodgy.
Cons: Money isn&#39;t really going to get you much return.


So, what do you guys think?

I would more or less go with bartering, it&#39;s more fun. :D</description>

<p>It’s called a freezer.[/quote]<br>
How would he get this freezer though? He can’t buy anything, he would have to trade what the person WANTS. Barter is gay imo.</p>

              <p>Using money is the modern way of bartering. You do realize that if everyone goes back to bartering, you also lose big company’s that produce chemical things. I don’t see a company that produces toxic or explosive products give their products to their employees so they can trade them.</p>
