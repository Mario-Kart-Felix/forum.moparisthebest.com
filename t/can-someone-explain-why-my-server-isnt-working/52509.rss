no-ip...himachi.... runserver.....compiler.....moparscape,

and thats how i usually run it yah? and today it decides not to let anyone else on... if this is the problem please say now! ---- ( if the ports aren&#39;t open? )...

              <p>You don’t use no-ip &amp; Hamachi. Pick one.</p>
<p>If you choose no-ip you need to Port Forward if you have a router. If you use Hamachi they need your Hamachi ip.</p>
<p>To run it do this:</p>
<p>Compile<br>
Run server<br>
Load hamachi<br>
Give out Hamachi ip &amp; port<br>
Have people connect.</p>
