    <description>Difficulty- 2/10 if your smart and catch on fast.
Noob guide  

First step to coding a rsps is getting a good  source and client ( on moparscape there are many )
Second step, making sure you can compile and run the server/client.
Once you have all of this in the client folder search for &quot;Client&quot; and you will find it ( in the file on the top right hand corner it says &quot; Search your client name&quot; that right there will be your best friend.
Changing the name of the source is simple, in the &quot; search&quot; column try the name of the server you found so if the name was &quot; Everlasting&quot; you would search Everlasting and change that name to yours using Ctrl+f &lt;--- this also will be your best friend. 
If the owners name is anywhere on the client/in-game id change to your name by searching this name in the clients &quot; Search&quot; column.

If you wanna leach it there you go lolol. But if you wanna know read on.

Once all that is done id change the home if you don&#39;t like it where it is at. Go into the game and teleport home and type ::mycords what you get from this commands type in your sources search column and change the Where the start cords to the new home you chose. 
Your own custom client can&#39;t be complete without your own custom commands. Go into your source and search &quot; commands&quot; click on the first on you see and look at all the commands. You can copy someone else&#39;s commands and put them in your source but this is the noob way to do things. If you really want to know how to code commands from scratch you might as well take a class or to or get someone who knows what they are doing ( it is simple when you catch on to it. ) 
ADDING ITEMS-
Java SE JDK - to compile and test out your models (70 mb)
DatMaker - to convert .mqo to .dat (500 kb)
Metasequoia - edits models (25 mb?)
7-Zip - to gzip the .dat files (1 mb)
.mqo - the model that opens with metasequioa
.dat - the model that opens with datmaker, the file format that the client reads
.gz - a gzipped dat, will explain later

        if (i == 14619) { //#### NOT related to the #### for the .gz file, put something around 11000
            class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5]; //DONT NEED TO CHANGE
            class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;; //The label for the item
            class8.anInt174 = 13580; //Model ID, the DROP MODEL for the .gz
            class8.anInt181 = 1957; //zoom increase will make it smaller
            class8.anInt190 = 498; //model rotate up+down increase to move doen away from you //DONT NEED TO CHANGE
            class8.anInt198 = 484; //model rotate side ways increase to move right in circle //DONT NEED TO CHANGE
            class8.anInt169 = -1; // model offset increase to move to the right //DONT NEED TO CHANGE
            class8.anInt194 = -1; //model offset increase to move up //DONT NEED TO CHANGE
            class8.anInt175 = -1; //your item int may not have every single variable,
            class8.anInt197 = -1; //it&#39;s completely fine
            class8.anInt165 = 13581; //male wearing, the WEARING model for the .gz
            class8.anInt200 = 13581; //female wearing, samet thing for ^
            class8.aString170 = &quot;SavageSword&quot;; //the item name!!!
            class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;A heavy sword made for i am savage&quot;.getBytes(); //description
        }
      - Credits to Project Rainbow for adding a custom!
Some of these simple things can make a whole word of difference between &quot;making a server&quot; compared to &quot; leaching&quot;
leaching is basically where you just take a client/source and change the name and add your character name in there to look legit. Making a server is totally redoing a server to making it look like your creation. Such as adding a ncp here and there, redoing the home or getting a totally new home, adding customs, creating new commands, changing the teleports around. There is a huge difference. Simple changes can be leaches to. But for now if your a &quot;noob&quot; follow this guide. You can have your own server in pronto ;)

<p>Some of these simple things can make a whole word of difference between “making a server” compared to " leaching"<br>
leaching is basically where you just take a client/source and change the name and add your character name in there to look legit. Making a server is totally redoing a server to making it look like your creation. Such as adding a ncp here and there, redoing the home or getting a totally new home, adding customs, creating new commands, changing the teleports around. There is a huge difference.
