    <title>Completely Clueless</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/completely-clueless/264630</link>
    <description>I know nothing about editing private servers. Absolutely nothing.

Idk what programs are needed to edit them.  And i also do not know how to run a private server after i&#39;ve downloaded a source.  I don&#39;t mean run it for other people, i mean just run it for me to play by myself. 

I&#39;ve noticed you guys are kinda hard on people new to this subject, but i&#39;m hopeful you&#39;ll find some compassion somewhere and just give me some information to get me started :P  Because as of now, i know next to nothing, but i&#39;m interested in learning.  I don&#39;t need helping with editing itself.  I need to know HOW to edit though.  Where to find the files i need to open, and what to open them with.  I also need to know how to play the client after editing so i can see what I&#39;ve done in-game.

Thank you very very much in advance to anyone who can tell me anything.  I appreciate it guys, thanks :)

<p>When editing the ItemWieldableDef.xml you edit the right thing.</p>
<p>Example: search for 81, this is for R2h. I am sure I read somewhere in a tutorial on here that the  was for the item ID, when it’s actually .</p>
<p>Take a look at the Animations.RSCD file for changing the colour when wearing ^^[/quote]</p>
<p>He didnt ask to change the color but its most probably because you didnt compile the server after you saved your file.<br>
That is probably the most common problem for newer “coders”</p>
<p>And try not to pay attention to Lolwut44 hes grouchy and doesnt offer help, he is quite angry that he lost his mod so if he says anything about “helping” you, you should probably ignore it, as it will do you no good.</p>

              <p>Well i’m new so i grabbed the first thing i could see <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> i know these questions may seem simple to you, but i really appreciate you answering them, it saves me tons of time. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>There is a “src” folder in both the “client” and the “server” folder. i’m assuming i edit the ones in the “server” folder, is that correct?</p>

              <p>Ok! i took your advice, and through a combination of Google and Moparscape forums i was able to piece together how to run a local server for me to play only.  But for the life of me i can’t figure out which files to edit, and how to edit them to change things in-game.  I’m using Divine PK source, and when i open the the folder it’s stored in, there are 4 folder i can open: “Client”, “Mysql database”, “Server”, and “www”.</p>
<p>Where do i go to reach the files that i edit to change things in-game, and what do i use to edit them? Am i able to use notepad or do i need a specific program.</p>
<p>Thanks for anything you can help me with <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I know nothing about editing private servers. Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Idk what programs are needed to edit them.  And i also do not know how to run a private server after i’ve downloaded a source.  I don’t mean run it for other people, i mean just run it for me to play by myself.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed you guys are kinda hard on people new to this subject, but i’m hopeful you’ll find some compassion somewhere and just give me some information to get me started <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Because as of now, i know next to nothing, but i’m interested in learning.  I don’t need helping with editing itself.  I need to know HOW to edit though.  Where to find the files i need to open, and what to open them with.  I also need to know how to play the client after editing so i can see what I’ve done in-game.</p>
<p>Thank you very very much in advance to anyone who can tell me anything.  I appreciate it guys, thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
