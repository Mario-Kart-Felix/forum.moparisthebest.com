    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/location-reset-after-logging-out/165386</link>
    <description>Every time anybody logs out of my server, they end up re-spawning at the place you start instead of where they where when they logged out, iv had a look in most of the files that control the logging out and in process but i cant seem to find anything, can someone tell me what i may have missed, thanks.
