    <description>From what I can these look the most stable bases to make a 2006 style server, I have some what I believe to be original ideas and need a good starting point to make a very PVM based p serv, with some interesting pvp dynamics.

So if someone could hook me up with the downloads to get this rolling, I have been searching but everything is 2 or so years old.

Willing to pay.</description>
