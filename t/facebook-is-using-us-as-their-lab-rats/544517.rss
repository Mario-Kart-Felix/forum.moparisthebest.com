I wasn’t talking about collecting information on what ads you click. It’s the whole idea about how social networking influences your real world choices. Facebook just used adverts to get that across.</p>
<p>Unknowingly you could be doing something that Facebook influenced when in reality you may never have done it.</p>
<p>Take this crummy example which relates to mopar:</p>
<p>Facebooks content led to you guys playing my rsps. Even though it’s shit, lags at 5 players, poor Eco, you’ll still play.</p>
<p>Being able to make people do that is messed up. They’re even saying that there’s like an algorithm for this type of control.</p>
<p>How would you feel that you’re being made do something without realising it?<br>
[/quote]<br>
It is not mind control which is what you seem to think it is. It’s suggestive manipulation, in the end people make their own decisions which means in your example, I would not play your crappy server.[/quote]<br>
Facebook said that they are going deeper into actually making people do things. It’s not just suggestive manipulation anymore.</p>
<p>Mind control is a little over the top though. Giving somebody the though to do something is insane as is but actually getting people to do it? That’s what they’re trying to do. Why else would it be a hot topic. We know that being able to get people to consider things but I guess that’s not enough for some people.</p>
<p>If you did take a rsps as an example:</p>
<p>The advert would be to try get you to play. Taking advertising one step further and making you play without you knowing I had that control over your choice.</p>
<p>A lot can be achieved with just doing that. Imagine an army of derps.</p>

<p>Well actually the research they’ve done hasn’t led them to profit whatsoever. The purpose of this experiment is to find out whether positive acts towards another person gives positive or negative thoughts towards that person. They’ve found that positive reinforcement invokes even more positive enforcement from the viewer. As apposed to the viewer being happier to see negative enforcement on someone else. I guess this proves that people aren’t as heartless as it seems. You could even say people are closer together than we think, and what we do and say does influence the world around us.</p>

<p>Sure it hasn’t been a direct profit right now, but you can’t deny they are trying to find a way to correlate that to ad clicks</p>

              <p>I wasn’t talking about collecting information on what ads you click. It’s the whole idea about how social networking influences your real world choices. Facebook just used adverts to get that across.</p>
<p>Unknowingly you could be doing something that Facebook influenced when in reality you may never have done it.</p>
<p>Take this crummy example which relates to mopar:</p>
<p>Facebooks content led to you guys playing my rsps. Even though it’s shit, lags at 5 players, poor Eco, you’ll still play.</p>
<p>Being able to make people do that is messed up. They’re even saying that there’s like an algorithm for this type of control.</p>
<p>How would you feel that you’re being made do something without realising it?</p>

<p>Also, what do you think TV commercials are?  People are paid to study how people react to anything and everything.  This data is then utilized at the advantage of playing with your emotions.  This has been going on for, well, since anyone had any sort of emotion.  That’s how people can be <span class="bbcode-i">sly</span>, <span class="bbcode-i">charming</span>, <span class="bbcode-i">persuasive</span>, etc…  They’ve studied how people react to different things.</p>
<p>Now, definitely not endorsing it.  I think this shit is fucked up.  But with every breath you take, there is some information out there wherever it may be, that can be used to make you take that breath differently.</p>

<p>Wait, someone has just informed me that you aren’t forced into signing up into facebook and that, in fact, you do not even have to post on the website.</p>
<p>I don’t see how they’re controlling people or using them like lab rats. Every major site does it. Google does it, anything microsoft, or apple… How do you think they figure out what we supposedly like. By just guessing and spending a couple mill in product design and hope that we like it? No. They either buy the data from another company, or they get the data themselves.</p>
