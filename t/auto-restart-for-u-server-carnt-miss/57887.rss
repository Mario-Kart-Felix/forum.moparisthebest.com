[/shadow]This works for any source. (I also fixed the download)

Many people havn&#39;t noticed there is that antilag.java file sitting in your source. Well that file is supposed to auto-restart your server. Most servers don&#39;t use it, but when your server has usually been up for a while and a lot of people connect and disconnect it uses more memory, and that memory doesn&#39;t go back down unless you restart your server.

So we are going to remove that file. Replace it with a new one and make it work.
I make my tutorials very organized, so it helps you guys better. Rep+ is always appreciated 

Open server.java &amp; find:


Code:
antilag = new antilag();Replace it with:


Code:
restartHandler = new RestartHandler();Find:


Code:
antilag.process();Replace it with:


Code:
restartHandler.process();Find:


Code:
public static antilag antilag = null;Replace it with:


Code:
public static RestartHandler restartHandler = null;Save server.java and close it.

Find your antilag.java file and delete it.
Now download: Files1.zip
from here: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=E3ENAFQG
Extract it.

Open RestartHandler.java (from the download)

Find: 


Code:
public int schedule = 7200;  	// 3600 = 30 mins,  7200 = 1 hr,  43200 = 6 hrs
			// 86400 = 12 hrs,  172800 = 1 day,  1209600 = 7 daysNow change the schedule to the amount of time it will be until your server restarts. By defualt I set it to 7200 which = 1 hour.

Place RestartHandler.java with your other files. (from the download)
Place Restart.bat in the same folder as your other .bat file. (from the download)

NOTE: When it restarts it doesnt show the server window (it runs in the background of your comp) But it lets you know that it initialiez correctly in the server monitor u were running. So you just close that one. But the server is restarted and is still running. OK?

Rep+ is always appreciated.</description>
