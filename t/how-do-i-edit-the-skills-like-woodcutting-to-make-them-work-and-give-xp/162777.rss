    <title>How do I edit the skills like woodcutting, to make them work and give xp?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-edit-the-skills-like-woodcutting-to-make-them-work-and-give-xp/162777</link>
    <description>Im wanting to make my skills work, by people using euqipment with an object and then getting xp in certain skills for example using a bronze axe on a tree, however I don&#39;t know how to change the values for the Xp given per tree and also how much xp each level needs to go up by...?

So I would love maybe a link to a tutorial or maybe just a quick tutorial on editing skills here.

Im using testscape by the way.

Thankyou.
