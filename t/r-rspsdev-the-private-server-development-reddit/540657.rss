Hello!  [url=http://www.reddit.com/r/rspsdev/]/r/rspsdev[/url] is an attempt at bringing RuneScape Private Server development to Reddit.  It doesn&#39;t have a lot to offer right now, but the purpose of this subreddit is for the private server community to get together and collaborate on the development of private servers.  Anyone and everyone is welcomed and encouraged to join the community.  Feel free to talk about anything involving the development of private servers.  Post tutorials, share code, discuss techniques and concepts, etc.  The only thing that we ask is that you [b][u]do not advertise your private server.[/u][/b]  I really hope that I can keep this subreddit as relaxed as possible, and would like to encourage a very friendly community.

The purpose of this subreddit is not to draw any attention away from this site or any other RSPS website.  I highly encourage posting links from this site, as well as any other, in the subreddit.  My only true goal is to attempt to bring as much information as possible together in one place.

The subreddit is currently in the very beginning stages (I only created it 15-20 minutes ago), and I am currently attempting to figure everything out.  So it is not very flashy right now, but bare with me!  If you have any comment, questions, concerns, etc.  feel free to post them here or in [url=http://www.reddit.com/r/rspsdev/]/r/rspsdev[/url].

Also, please feel free to join us on IRC.

              <p>I like the idea of a rsps subreddit because it’d attract a lot of attention from people who may not be familiar that communities like Mopar/R-S exist plus it’s a lot easier to get into a subreddit than a forum community where things are more personal. Cool.</p>
