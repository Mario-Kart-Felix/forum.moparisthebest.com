<p>Yeah, it has to be the same. If I remember correctly, the client supplies half the IV and the server supplies the other half.</p>

<p>Yeah, but that sounds like a heck of a lot of work. Might as well just edit the client. :rolleyes:</p>

              <p>Well,</p>
<p>The cryption class is constructed with a key the server sends us during initialization.<br>
For every frame, the RNG adds its number to the opcode of the frame.</p>
<p>If we hook the last key and store it as a field somewhere, we can always go back and forth on it, maybe wrapping the original cryption class so we can hook whatever indexes or counters it contains, allowing us to create our own frames, or read existing ones.</p>

Because every time the client sends a frame, basically it encrypts the frame id by grabbing the next encryption key in an array that’s created when you log in. The server then reads that value and uses that same key to decrypt the frame id. If you inject a packet, the server will decrypt that using the next value in the array, but the client will still be one behind.</p>
<p>I hope that was understandable, I’m not very good at explaining things. =P<br>

<p>The individual packet headers use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher#Synchronous_stream_ciphers" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">synchronous stream cipher</a> with a Java port of ISAAC as the number generator. Injection is possible; what we can’t do is predict the next number that will come out of ISAAC (as far as I know, it’s gone 10ish years with no published attacks). All this really means is that you have to keep the client and server in sync, which can be accomplished by using the client’s RNG instance or by grabbing the seed array and keeping up with your own instance.[/quote]<br>
But would it be possible to inject a packet? It seems to me that the server would move to the next number and the client wouldn’t, so they’d be out of sync.</p>

              <p>Actually mopar, the packet algorithm doesn’t change each update. And making a bcel updater would help with the injection of the cypher clocking. Anyway, its not obsolete due to “better ways”, its obsolete due to detectability, its as detectable as deobs, if not more. They will also then start to change the packet ids / algorithm. Anyway yeh. If you wanted to make a bot “similar” to autorune that used packets etc. theres 3 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Decrypt packets -&gt; extract data -&gt; parse all the data -&gt; world 2 screen the data -&gt; click the correct spot<br>
This would also allow you to store info easily, such as things about players etc. It would be a great way if someone     “could be arsed to do it” and as it goes, the current algorithm is easy to get around <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second method would be similar to how people think the chinese bot works atm, basically make your own client, include all the client math algorithms and modulus etc. Then you can replicate the client exactly, and mould it to what you like (By making your own client, I mean without graphics etc.) this would also help you get around reflection etc. however, you would have to fake the reflection/mouse movement packets etc. etc. etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basically replicate autorune, hook the cypher etc. then just do the same thing as autorune, but filter all the mousemovement packets, fake your own and send them off, there would also be alot of other faking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>anyway thats a kinda brief summary of some “packet” bots you could do. Anyway yeh hope it helps.</p>
<p>EDIT: I thought this was an RS2 thread, oh well, its pretty much the same but I dont know if the reflection/mousemovements are actually logged in RSC.<br>
Heh, well this will work for both RSC and RS2. Yeh anyway.</p>

              <p>The best RSC bot is AutoRune… The respond time is magnificant and very scriptable.  I personally used Sbot all the time (got 99 att, def, str, mining, and smithing with it).  I think Sbot is easier to script probably because I did more with that.</p>
