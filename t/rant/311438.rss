    <description>Im sick of all these gay ass mods who lock threads whenever they feel like it for no good reason, im sick of all these bastards that think they&#39;re cool and try to act tough, and people who are just damn retarded. Whenever I make a thread the first post is &quot;amg dis thread s00x delete plz i report!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; they report it and it gets locked for no hell of a reason. What the fuck is wrong with these mods? Even googles mods are better than mopars. Actually, I might even go back to google because this is a shit community who doesn&#39;t care about each other whatsoever.

I bet the first post will be &quot;reported&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re late&quot; like every other post these assholes make.

EDIT: Even better, I will list the biggest assholes of the community. They think they&#39;re cool and report topics because they feel like it:
