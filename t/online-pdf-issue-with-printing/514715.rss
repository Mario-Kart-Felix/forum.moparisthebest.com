    <title>Online pdf issue with printing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/online-pdf-issue-with-printing/514715</link>
    <description>So at work when I am trying to print a document like from an online pdf(in Chrome, have not tested other browsers pdf readers) I can tell it to print in black and white...however it is still printing in color even after I select black and white. Any ideas? I can tell it to send it to the adobe reader, have it print in black and white just fine though so it makes me think it&#39;s a browser issue?</description>
