    <title>Eye condition?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eye-condition/91447</link>
    <description>I have just been wondering if this is just something strange that no one never thought to try or if it is a side effect from the tear duct surgery i had when i was little. If i plug my nose and close my mouth and breath out, air comes out from the corners of my eyes, i did it in class once, and it was loud enough bubbling for everyone in the room to look at me lol</description>

<p>TearDuct surgery, were you one of those kids that always cried ( for a real reason not emo related), i knew a kid with fucked up tear ducts and it always looked like he was crying, he used to get beaten up rotten.[/quote]<br>
Idk, it was when i was really little, like 4 or 5, and i just thought it was odd because it only comes out my right eye.</p>
<p>[quote=“3.65 kilos, post:13, topic:91447”]It is perfectly normal for that to happen. For the majority of people, air comes out of ears instead of eyes.</p>
<p>Why this happens: Your tear ducts are tubes going from your eye to the inside of your nose. One for each eye. Your eyes are covered in tears to prevent bacteria and stuff, the bacteria gets trapped in the tears. Every time you blink, the old tears stuff (with the bacteria) is forced down your tear ducts and a new layer of tears covers your eyes. The old tears are then in your nose. (Which is why when you cry (excess tear build up) the tears drain through your nose, causing a runny nose.).</p>
<p>Put some milk in your nose and try to squirt it out your eye, lol.[/quote]<br>
i really dont wanna put milk up my nose -.- lol</p>

For a while I would plug my nose and mouth and then try to blow out and some sort of air would come out of my ear lol. It happened my first time on an airplane. When we were landing my ears were really sore then all of a sudden they made a really loud POP sound and for about a month after I was able to blow air out of them.<br>
[/quote]<br>
uh, that dont sound health… as long as my nose isnt plugged i can do it very easy with my eyes, which is why i think they slipped when operating on my tear duct and poked a hole in there… so if you try it, it doesnt come out ur eye?[/quote]</p>
<p>I think I’ve had puffs come out of my eye before when I was trying to blow my nose.</p>
