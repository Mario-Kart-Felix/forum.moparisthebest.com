              <p>1984, you realize the reason people post their models on here, is to get feedback and criticism or to show off their work. Giving him constructive criticism wouldn’t make any sence because he really didn’t do anything but recolor and move some primitive shapes onto a model made by JaGex. So without the option to appraise him for his “masterpiece” or give him suggestions on what he did wrong in the modelling process, our members are naturally impulsed to tell him to actually do something next time.</p>

<p>this model is not his… i could prove it by making the exact same model in less then 2 minutes…</p>
<p>he said it was fully his… i get pissed about these things even if it is fagex’s model… because even if we pretty much are a site<br>
that promotes illigal p-server behavior (which btw would shut us down if sopa passed) in the model section we support peoples creativity and want people to actually make models so we can awe in the site of them… we look at this and go “tefuq is this?”</p>

Not one of us here support SOPA at all. Do you even realize that SOPA would shut down us, along with R-S had it passed? And although the coding thing is accurate for certain instances, what happens when those coders take 100% credit? The same thing happens here. My first "model" was an edited Dragon 2H, and I said so in my posts. However, it was actually edited enough that people didn't know it was a Jagex model to begin with. But when I edited an obsidian shield and tried to take credit, I was immediately flamed, but that didn't stop me. I continued modeling my own models. That flame alone should be encouragement to make original models, because nobody wants that to happen to them twice.

There was no originality, just a new hilt or color. Now we're sick of it, and don't want to see any more of it. All of those items could already be seen on every server, so why would we want people re-releasing them, and yet they would take full credit? WE DON'T. We like and encourage originality, not some additions to Jagex models. This is why you don't see recolors here anymore, and why you see real models with effort put into them. Its rare for any of us to release for servers anymore, because we've advanced so far BECAUSE of what we do and don't support. If we were to support and praise recolors here, what would this section be filled with? Recolors. Since we don't support them, they aren't here, only ones we've created from scratch. Stop trying to prove now invalid points.

<p>He didn’t take someone elses panting and then just add a few brushes of paint to it, he actually started drawing on his own, your point there is invalid.</p>
<blockquote>And who's to say recolors are so bad. When done right they are in some cases better than new models. Besides, Jagex uses recolors all the time and players go googoo over them.</blockquote>
<p>We say recolours are bad because they’re not your own work, just because they might look better doesn’t mean it is right. they’re jagex’s models to use, they don’t take models from another game recolour them and then put them into their own game.</p>

<p>I am more advanced at modelling because i make my own models, i don’t recolour items that aren’t mine. i also dislike recolours, i think they’re worse then the model in the first place. I do not celebrate my work, i post it for opinions. Everyone on this forum and other forums aren’t advanced modellers because they’re still just starting off, none of the people on a forum are a part of a major gaming company and that shows we’re not as advanced as most.</p>
<blockquote>Don't make yourself to be greater than you are because that will only bring the bashing comments that the poor poster of this thread is recieving on to you.</blockquote>
I've never said 'I'm the best modeller in the world, bow before me because i am just that great!', never. Stop jumping to conclusions about people, you've obviously not been around this forum long enough to understand people. When you start off you get it tough, take it or leave it. We're not here to fill your world with unicorns and rainbows, we're here to critisize those who can't do it on their own. Sadly for most, our critisism is tough when it comes to recolours because our community is more advanced when others in model making.

<p>lol, we dont support recolors, we are more than happy to support and provide good advice to people who make actual models. Talking against the community doesnt get you banned, but im willing to be you started flaming everyone because your little recolor got flamed and you took it personally.</p>

<p>You guys are all fucking stupid. This is why most people go to rune serber. It’s because this communtity is filled with unsupportful pricks that everyone else has moved on. I’ve already been banned once on here for talking against the community and if I get banned for this post well then the mods here would be doing me a favor.[/quote]Excuse me? We don’t support recolors here, we encourage originality and creativity, not just changing the colors on something and adding a few spikes. All R-S’s model section has to offer is Runescape model releases and recolors, and everyone flocks to those instead of the original ones. I’ve seen so many good, original models get maybe 10 posts max on their threads when the shitty recolored items get 50, when almost no effort is put into them! If you honestly think a recolor is better than an original model, then leave, because nobody here thinks that at all. And we have unsupportful pricks? At least we actually support people who want to learn how to model, instead of R-S where people flock to every recolored skillcape model there is…</p>
<p>So please, I’d advise not calling us stupid when we as a community actually have some more common sense than the average user, like yourself.</p>

<p>Don’t lie. I know for a fact you didn’t model 100% of this because that platebody is identical to other ones on Runescape. Unless you would like to post a wireframe, I’m going to report you for leeching and not giving credit.</p>
