Everybody has a starting point and at that point their work obviously isn’t going to be all that amazing. The majority of the people in this community refuse to support those new to certain things, models in this case. It is for this reason that Rune-Serber is a better place. Although there are some hateful fags there, it doesn’t even come close to the number of self ritious jackasses that are active here on mopar. You can’t even try to deny that this community is more hateful and less advanced as there is proof in almost every topic posted on this website.<br>
[/quote]less advanced? No. More hateful? Most likely. Please remember the moparscape and moparisthebest are the same communities as they use the same accounts. There’s also tutorials all over the forums and stickies, also. Although I personally wish that people shouldn’t bash recolors and instead link them to a tutorial.[/quote]</p>

<p>IT’S HIS FIRST MODEL. Just like hundreds of other custom items, he built his first one off of one of Jagex’s models. Do you Picasso started off by looking for help on how to draw? No, he started off drawing stickmen just like every other kid in the world although he later became one of the worlds most influential and succesfull artists.</p>
<p>And who’s to say recolors are so bad. When done right they are in some cases better than new models. Besides, Jagex uses recolors all the time and players go googoo over them.</p>
<p>You are just taking other peoples ideologies that you have picked up here at mopar and wearing them like your own because you consider yourself to be a more advanced modeler. I however have seen your work and it is not all that amazing but still worth celebrating as like the poster of this thread, you too are just a fresh modeler beginning your journey.</p>
<p>Don’t make yourself to be greater than you are because that will only bring the bashing comments that the poor poster of this thread is recieving on to you.</p>

<p>He didn’t take someone elses panting and then just add a few brushes of paint to it, he actually started drawing on his own, your point there is invalid.</p>
<blockquote>And who's to say recolors are so bad. When done right they are in some cases better than new models. Besides, Jagex uses recolors all the time and players go googoo over them.</blockquote>
<p>We say recolours are bad because they’re not your own work, just because they might look better doesn’t mean it is right. they’re jagex’s models to use, they don’t take models from another game recolour them and then put them into their own game.</p>
<blockquote>You are just taking other peoples ideologies that you have picked up here at mopar and wearing them like your own because you consider yourself to be a more advanced modeler. I however have seen your work and it is not all that amazing but still worth celebrating as like the poster of this thread, you too are just a fresh modeler beginning your journey.</blockquote>
<p>I am more advanced at modelling because i make my own models, i don’t recolour items that aren’t mine. i also dislike recolours, i think they’re worse then the model in the first place. I do not celebrate my work, i post it for opinions. Everyone on this forum and other forums aren’t advanced modellers because they’re still just starting off, none of the people on a forum are a part of a major gaming company and that shows we’re not as advanced as most.</p>
<blockquote>Don't make yourself to be greater than you are because that will only bring the bashing comments that the poor poster of this thread is recieving on to you.</blockquote>
I've never said 'I'm the best modeller in the world, bow before me because i am just that great!', never. Stop jumping to conclusions about people, you've obviously not been around this forum long enough to understand people. When you start off you get it tough, take it or leave it. We're not here to fill your world with unicorns and rainbows, we're here to critisize those who can't do it on their own. Sadly for most, our critisism is tough when it comes to recolours because our community is more advanced when others in model making.

<p>No it’s fucking not. He modified a Jagex model, and that alone is in compliance with the rules, but then he took full credit for it, which is theft. It’s almost painful how misguided you are.</p>

        <p>I honestly cannot believe how fucking retarded all of you are. If you guys refuse to change your view towards the noobies, this community will never advance and will instead remain a group of bashful douchebags. Pretty much every coder starts coding by picking up someone elses work and adding onto it. It’s one of the easiest ways to learn. You guys are probably all aboard the SOPA, PIPA, and ACTA trains, being too stupid to realize how it would negatively impact everyone.</p>
<p>Now think were some of the most popular custom models when custom models were the bees knees. Death cape was probably number 1 as almost every server had it. Now think what was the death cape? It was just a skillcape with wings on it. What about all those lame custom godswords that everyone seemed to love? They were all just regular godsword blades, taken from jagex and given new hilts. But that’s not even it, all the demonic plate armour sets were just jagex model rehashes. What about bronze (g) and the new mystic robe sets that were released and everybody loved. They were just recolors of 377 models yet they recieved no negative feedback.</p>
<p>The only reason you guys are being hateful here is because it is his first time working with models and you guys feel the need to put him down to make yourselves feel better.</p>

Not one of us here support SOPA at all. Do you even realize that SOPA would shut down us, along with R-S had it passed? And although the coding thing is accurate for certain instances, what happens when those coders take 100% credit? The same thing happens here. My first "model" was an edited Dragon 2H, and I said so in my posts. However, it was actually edited enough that people didn't know it was a Jagex model to begin with. But when I edited an obsidian shield and tried to take credit, I was immediately flamed, but that didn't stop me. I continued modeling my own models. That flame alone should be encouragement to make original models, because nobody wants that to happen to them twice.
<blockquote>Now think were some of the most popular custom models when custom models were the bees knees. Death cape was probably number 1 as almost every server had it. Now think what was the death cape? It was just a skillcape with wings on it. What about all those lame custom godswords that everyone seemed to love? They were all just regular godsword blades, taken from jagex and given new hilts. But that's not even it, all the demonic plate armour sets were just jagex model rehashes. What about bronze (g) and the new mystic robe sets that were released and everybody loved. They were just recolors of 377 models yet they recieved no negative feedback.</blockquote>Of course they didn't receive negative feedback, that was way back when. There was no originality, just a new hilt or color. Now we're sick of it, and don't want to see any more of it. All of those items could already be seen on every server, so why would we want people re-releasing them, and yet they would take full credit? WE DON'T. We like and encourage originality, not some additions to Jagex models. This is why you don't see recolors here anymore, and why you see real models with effort put into them. Its rare for any of us to release for servers anymore, because we've advanced so far BECAUSE of what we do and don't support. If we were to support and praise recolors here, what would this section be filled with? Recolors. Since we don't support them, they aren't here, only ones we've created from scratch. Stop trying to prove now invalid points.

<p>this model is not his… i could prove it by making the exact same model in less then 2 minutes…</p>
<p>he said it was fully his… i get pissed about these things even if it is fagex’s model… because even if we pretty much are a site<br>
that promotes illigal p-server behavior (which btw would shut us down if sopa passed) in the model section we support peoples creativity and want people to actually make models so we can awe in the site of them… we look at this and go “tefuq is this?”</p>

I’m pretty sure all you’re doing is making youself look like a complete idiot, there is no need for this. Had he just taken our rude comments and turned it into modivation to make better models he would have achieved soemthing by now but instead someone decides to come and make pointless comments to defend him when frankly you don’t need to.

        <p>1984, you realize the reason people post their models on here, is to get feedback and criticism or to show off their work. Giving him constructive criticism wouldn’t make any sence because he really didn’t do anything but recolor and move some primitive shapes onto a model made by JaGex. So without the option to appraise him for his “masterpiece” or give him suggestions on what he did wrong in the modelling process, our members are naturally impulsed to tell him to actually do something next time.</p>
