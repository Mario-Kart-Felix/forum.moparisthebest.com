    <title>I can&#39;t get my compiler to work. Somthing to do with the classpaths?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-get-my-compiler-to-work-somthing-to-do-with-the-classpaths/7627</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t get my compiler to work. It says &quot;&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command.&quot;
I recently read a thread that said the classpaths need to be set.But exactly how do I do that? :confused:
I really need help on it, so i can put more npc&#39;s on my server, and also add health to the npcs.</description>
