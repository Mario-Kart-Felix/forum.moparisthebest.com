    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-need-of-a-designer/507360</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a horrible designer and I dont really know what color works with another. I&#39;ve googled and didnt really find anything that caught my eye.
Im looking for 2 colors. 1 will be the background and the other will accent it in different parts of the page, any ideas?</description>

              <p>I think the way you should do it is, design it on photoshop, if your not happy with colors you can sit there spending your whole day in experimenting and after you have finished designing the layout and the amazing buttons for your website then you can slice them and put them all together using html + css.</p>

<p>You can’t really go wrong with simple, complimenting colours. It doesn’t have to be extravagant. In my opinion and experience I’m actually more drawn to simple, more professional sites rather than flashy and slow loading sites. Just my two cents :P.</p>
