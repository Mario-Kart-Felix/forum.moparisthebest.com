    <title>Adding a custom model?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-a-custom-model/407614</link>
    <description>sorry if this is something really easy to do. I&#39;m not a pro coder, expecially when it comes to the client sided stuff. I want to put the christmas tree, that was in the christmas event of 2005, in varrock square on my server. I was told i need to add a custom model. Is there anyway i can get the model for the christmas tree, and add it to my client, than add it to my server?

EDIT: I think i posted this in the wrong section. If i did, can i mod plz move it for me?</description>
