    <title>Changing an Item&#39;s Color</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-an-items-color/427141</link>
    <description>Sorry that I have asked quite a few questions as of late. I try to look around before asking, and skim code.

Well, I found in the Client side in my ItemDef_2.java this bit of code that stood out to me.

itemDef.modifiedModelColors = new int[1];
            itemDef.originalModelColors = new int[1];
            itemDef.modifiedModelColors[0] = 926;
            itemDef.originalModelColors[0] = 9583;

The entire bit of code for the item is this...

        case 3272:
            itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
            itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;
            itemDef.modifiedModelColors = new int[1];
            itemDef.originalModelColors = new int[1];
            itemDef.modifiedModelColors[0] = 926;
            itemDef.originalModelColors[0] = 9583;
            itemDef.modelid = 2438;
            itemDef.modelZoom = 730;
            itemDef.modelRotationY = 516;
            itemDef.modelRotationX = 0;
            itemDef.modelOffset1 = 0;
            itemDef.modelOffset2 = -10;
            itemDef.anInt165 = 3188;
            itemDef.anInt200 = 3192;
            itemDef.name = &quot;White h&#39;ween mask&quot;;
            itemDef.description = &quot;Aaaarrrghhh... I&#39;m a monster.&quot;;
break;

Well, I am wondering, is the &quot;modifiedModelcolors&quot; the way I can change the item colour?
And if so, what is it in? Obviously not Hex. Definitely doesn&#39;t look like RGB either.</description>

<p>Well, I am wondering, is the “modifiedModelcolors” the way I can change the item colour?<br>
And if so, what is it in? Obviously not Hex. Definitely doesn’t look like RGB either.</p>
