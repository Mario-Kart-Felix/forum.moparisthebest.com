    <title>Where in kick()?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-in-kick/193718</link>
    <description>I need a command to kick somebody to login screen, I have a working one, but it doesn&#39;t send them to login screen. Which means I have to put [code]outStream.createFrame(109);
directFlushOutStream();[/code] somewhere in the [code]kick();[/code] part of playerhandler.java right?

But where in kick(); do I put it? =S

Here&#39;s what it looks like in my PlayerHandler.java, if somebody could edit [code]outStream.createFrame(109);
directFlushOutStream();[/code] into it I would be quite happy.

[code]			if(players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(kickNick))
			{
				players[i].kick();
				kickNick=&quot;&quot;;
			}
			[/code]</description>
