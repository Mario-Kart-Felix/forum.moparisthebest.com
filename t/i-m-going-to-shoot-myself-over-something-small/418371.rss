    <description>I&#39;ve found the tut before, but for some fucking reason I cant&#39;t now. I have a PI and i&#39;m trying to make summoning effect the combat level so the max combat level is 138. Can anyone please help me start this or point me to a tut because I really can&#39;t find it.

I really appreciate the help anyone can gives.
