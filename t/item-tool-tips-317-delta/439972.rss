    <description>Been trying for sometime but not sure how to do this, does any one know how i can create  a tool tip for items

basicly when you highlight an item i want it to give a tool tip, kinda like when you right click it you get that menu, but basicly a hovering menu.

anyone know where i could start looking for this?
I&#39;ve looked in the client and server but the server seems to be the wrong direction, so i&#39;m not sure which spot to place this 
server help or client help, but either way i&#39;m not sure how to add tool tips and i&#39;m just looking for a good starting point.

Edit: Or how to call an interface on mouse over would be great too.</description>
