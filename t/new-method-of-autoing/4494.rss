    <title>New Method of Autoing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-method-of-autoing/4494</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t put in alot to this community, I just come here every few days and watch for new scripts, and look around a bit, I guess I&#39;d be a pretty big leech. I&#39;ve decided that I should try to commit a little more and maybe help out here a bit.

BUT, to get the point, I have been playing with this language called AutoHotKey (AHK) and I think it has some real potential. I&#39;m not like a pro at scripting for it, but it does have alot of commands, and i dont think its detectable either. I guess we&#39;ll find out. But here is the link to the website. [url=http://www.autohotkey.com]http://www.autohotkey.com[/url]

It comes with a really helpful help file with all the commands and examples in it, and the forums for it have alot of people who are really good at it that will help you with your scripts. It does update every few days/weeks so youll have to redownload/install for the new commands to work. But other than that. Its really simple.

Heres an example of a short script that would send input and loop it 10 times when your press f1, this input being characters.

[code]; semi colons would be the comment character.
f1::
loop, 10
{
           send, Hello World
}[/code]


 So, if your intrested please check it out. Any other questions ask me on msn: i4m7h3r331gingko@hotmail.com</description>

              <p>I remember autoing with autohotkey. It’s completely awful, since Runescape shifts 1 or 2 pixels every 45 seconds~ it’s impossible to do it correctly. Sure, it worked alright for 30 minutes or so, and you could also make it more complicated by adding FindPixel or whatever, but even then what would you do about randoms?</p>

              <p>Like I said, im not a pro at it. I just use it for simple things like auto sellers and whatnot. I was just trying to make a suggestion.</p>
<p>I will look into it a little more and maybe give a little more examples and figure out how i could get it to do the rough or mouse movement on a curve.</p>
