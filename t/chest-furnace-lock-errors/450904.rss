    <title>Chest/Furnace Lock errors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chest-furnace-lock-errors/450904</link>
    <description>I have had many issues with the locking system for chests and furnaces. My most recent one involves me being locked out of my own chest and furnace; even the /co inspect proves its mine. I was mining the day before the incident. When i came back, my chest full of iron and armour and such and my furnace loaded with gold was locked. I was killed by a creeper while trying to sort it out, and I now have a chest full of iron beside me as i am struggling with wooden tools. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM!!!
Has anyone else had this issue or others like it?
This is for the admins and moderators. I WANT MY CHEST AND FURNACE BACK!!!</description>
