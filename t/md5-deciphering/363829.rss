    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/md5-deciphering/363829</link>
    <description>OK so you know how in some servers there is this MD5 thing,
it makes pass go from like, omgufail, to like uhijkljhg483t56hjk5lk4hgjk
or something, well i know how to fix that but, how do i decipher them?
like see what the passwords are without having to go into client.java and deleting the first two things i see about PassHash to see the pass?</description>
