    <title>So I got a real gem from RS3 customer support</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-i-got-a-real-gem-from-rs3-customer-support/541219</link>
    <description>This story begins... as many stories do, with an attempt to subscribe for membership... I have 200 pounds on my account and I thought &quot;&#39;Eck, why not!&quot;.
So I go onto the subscription page (which by the way, went down for 4 hours as their entire website got botched, which they fixed by rolling back everyone by about 2 hours), I fill everything in and click &quot;submit&quot;; 10 seconds of spinny circle, I am met with a payment failure page. I proceed to check my bank, 195.05 pounds on my account... &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be damned!&quot; I said (I know the 4.95 is not gone, its on hold, pre-authorized a.k.a. successful payment.).
Note: The card I&#39;m attempting to subscribe with, has been used for subscription in the past.

And here&#39;s the good bit, I wrote to jagex customer support; And below here, will be what happened.

I wrote:
[spoiler]Hello,
Your subscription system is botched.
It pre-authorized 5 pounds from my account (successfully, mind you) and then the system seemed to simply fail to detect that it was in fact a successful payment attempt.

I can show you how your 4.95 has gone out of my account leaving just 5p.

You may want to get in touch with the monkeys who dun goofed that one up. [/spoiler]

I got a response the following day:
[spoiler]Hey Fuzzout,

Thanks for getting in touch with us.Mod [s]Peanut[/s] here to help .^_^

It&#39;s great to hear from you Fuzzout. ;)

I&#39;ve taken a look at your account and I can see that We haven&#39;t been able to complete your payment, and as such no membership has been added to your account – this is because the payment attempts have been declined by our systems. If you still want to use the same card, try again in 24 hours and check the following before you hit purchase:

*There is enough money in your account
*Your card number, CVV number and expiry date is typed in correctly
*You have selected the correct country at the top of the page – this should be the country you’re currently in.

If you’re still having trouble, or want to grab your membership straight away, try another card or check out our other payment options – such as PayByCash or PayPal.

One more important thing - If there are currently any payments showing on your bank statement, don&#39;t worry – these haven&#39;t been taken, and may be shown as &quot;pending&quot; or &quot;PA” (pre-authorised) amounts. These are shown because your bank has reserved the funds ready to send to us. However, as we couldn&#39;t take them the bank will automatically return these to you within a few days. [/spoiler]

So, once again I proceeded by writing back:
[spoiler]Thank you for your response,

I fail to see how that makes response, you even stated (in your generic copy &amp; paste message) that amounts are pre-authorized (I know how pre-auths work); I know that the 4.95 was NOT charged, but it WAS THERE on the bank account when I was trying to subscribe... Can you see the loophole?

Just to clarify what I mean:
1. I have 5 pounds on my account
2. I click subscribe, type everything in correctly
3. I click the confirm-payment button
4. Your system loads for a bit (while contacting my bank to check for available funds)
5. Your system successfully pre-authorizes the neccessary amount
6. My bank account retains some change to spare
---Up to the point above, everything is fine.---
---THE ISSUE IS BELOW---
7. Your system throws me to the &quot;Payment rejected&quot; page

So, in essence - it is impossible to subscribe right now. I have tried using two different debit cards for this, mine and my girlfriends; I have subscribed in the past with the very same card that I&#39;m talking about right now.
In one of your recent updates something was broken.

If possible please escalate this message. [/spoiler]

And once again I received this:
[spoiler]Hey Fuzzout,

Thanks for getting in touch with us.Mod [s]Peanut[/s] here to help .^_^

It&#39;s great to hear from you Fuzzout. ;)

As what I have said on my last message, our system has declined your payments and no membership has been added on your account. If you&#39;re seeing charges being made for the payment that has been declined by our system, don&#39;t worry these payments haven&#39;t been taken by us and will automatically be returned to you.

I suggest that you refrain from making any payment attempts within 24 hours to avoid any further confusions.

If you&#39;re that eager to grab your membership, your can always choose from our payment options available in your country such as PayByCash. [/spoiler]

My final response:
[spoiler]I will give this my final response.

A: &quot;As what I have said on my last message, our system has declined your payments and no membership has been added on your account.&quot;
C: Yes, I am aware of that.

My question is:
WHY is the system declining the payment?
I had 200 pounds on my account at the time when I wanted to subscribe and even though the PRE-AUTHORIZATION was SUCCESSFUL (4.95 on hold on my account), the membership request was denied.

So to re-iterate:
1. I had 200 pounds on my account.
2. I typed everything in, clicked &quot;pay&quot;
3. System successfully pre-authorizes the amount
4. The other end of your system fails to acknowledge that the PRE-AUTH was SUCCESSFUL
5. Membership is denied, money is returned.

I am trying to tell you that your online subscription page is broken!

And final repeat, just... for good measure (three times the charm, right?):
The online subscription system is failing because successful pre-authorizations fail to be detected within your systems subscription back-end.

Or to put it bluntly:
Runescape subscription system is fudgeed, please fix it, I would like to play this game.[/spoiler]

As you can see, neutron star levels of dense, is possible in humans. Who would&#39;ve thought.

P.S. Mods name was in fact replaced with a peanut as I don&#39;t intend to attack the mod. I am merely sharing in some wonderful Runescape 3 experience that I couldn&#39;t have.
P.P.S. I cannot play non-member worlds either because my bank is full of members items + It keeps shouting at me that I should subscribe.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>This story begins… as many stories do, with an attempt to subscribe for membership… I have 200 pounds on my account and I thought “'Eck, why not!”.<br>
So I go onto the subscription page (which by the way, went down for 4 hours as their entire website got botched, which they fixed by rolling back everyone by about 2 hours), I fill everything in and click “submit”; 10 seconds of spinny circle, I am met with a payment failure page. I proceed to check my bank, 195.05 pounds on my account… “Well, I’ll be damned!” I said (I know the 4.95 is not gone, its on hold, pre-authorized a.k.a. successful payment.).<br>
Note: The card I’m attempting to subscribe with, has been used for subscription in the past.</p>
<p>And here’s the good bit, I wrote to jagex customer support; And below here, will be what happened.</p>
<p>I wrote:<br>
[spoiler]Hello,<br>
Your subscription system is botched.<br>
It pre-authorized 5 pounds from my account (successfully, mind you) and then the system seemed to simply fail to detect that it was in fact a successful payment attempt.</p>
<p>I can show you how your 4.95 has gone out of my account leaving just 5p.</p>
<p>You may want to get in touch with the monkeys who dun goofed that one up. [/spoiler]</p>
<p>I got a response the following day:<br>
[spoiler]Hey Fuzzout,</p>
<p>Thanks for getting in touch with us.Mod <span class="bbcode-s">Peanut</span> here to help .<img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It’s great to hear from you Fuzzout. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I’ve taken a look at your account and I can see that We haven’t been able to complete your payment, and as such no membership has been added to your account – this is because the payment attempts have been declined by our systems. If you still want to use the same card, try again in 24 hours and check the following before you hit purchase:</p>
<p>*There is enough money in your account<br>
*Your card number, CVV number and expiry date is typed in correctly<br>
*You have selected the correct country at the top of the page – this should be the country you’re currently in.</p>
<p>If you’re still having trouble, or want to grab your membership straight away, try another card or check out our other payment options – such as PayByCash or PayPal.</p>
<p>One more important thing - If there are currently any payments showing on your bank statement, don’t worry – these haven’t been taken, and may be shown as “pending” or "PA” (pre-authorised) amounts. These are shown because your bank has reserved the funds ready to send to us. However, as we couldn’t take them the bank will automatically return these to you within a few days. [/spoiler]</p>
<p>So, once again I proceeded by writing back:<br>
[spoiler]Thank you for your response,</p>
<p>I fail to see how that makes response, you even stated (in your generic copy &amp; paste message) that amounts are pre-authorized (I know how pre-auths work); I know that the 4.95 was NOT charged, but it WAS THERE on the bank account when I was trying to subscribe… Can you see the loophole?</p>
<p>Just to clarify what I mean:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have 5 pounds on my account</li>
<li>I click subscribe, type everything in correctly</li>
<li>I click the confirm-payment button</li>
<li>Your system loads for a bit (while contacting my bank to check for available funds)</li>
<li>Your system successfully pre-authorizes the neccessary amount</li>
<li>My bank account retains some change to spare<br>
—Up to the point above, everything is fine.—<br>
—THE ISSUE IS BELOW—</li>
<li>Your system throws me to the “Payment rejected” page</li>
</ol>
<p>So, in essence - it is impossible to subscribe right now. I have tried using two different debit cards for this, mine and my girlfriends; I have subscribed in the past with the very same card that I’m talking about right now.<br>
In one of your recent updates something was broken.</p>
<p>If possible please escalate this message. [/spoiler]</p>
<p>And once again I received this:<br>
[spoiler]Hey Fuzzout,</p>
<p>Thanks for getting in touch with us.Mod <span class="bbcode-s">Peanut</span> here to help .<img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It’s great to hear from you Fuzzout. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>As what I have said on my last message, our system has declined your payments and no membership has been added on your account. If you’re seeing charges being made for the payment that has been declined by our system, don’t worry these payments haven’t been taken by us and will automatically be returned to you.</p>
<p>I suggest that you refrain from making any payment attempts within 24 hours to avoid any further confusions.</p>
<p>If you’re that eager to grab your membership, your can always choose from our payment options available in your country such as PayByCash. [/spoiler]</p>
<p>My final response:<br>
[spoiler]I will give this my final response.</p>
<p>A: "As what I have said on my last message, our system has declined your payments and no membership has been added on your account."<br>
C: Yes, I am aware of that.</p>
<p>My question is:<br>
WHY is the system declining the payment?<br>
I had 200 pounds on my account at the time when I wanted to subscribe and even though the PRE-AUTHORIZATION was SUCCESSFUL (4.95 on hold on my account), the membership request was denied.</p>
<p>So to re-iterate:</p>
<ol>
<li>I had 200 pounds on my account.</li>
<li>I typed everything in, clicked “pay”</li>
<li>System successfully pre-authorizes the amount</li>
<li>The other end of your system fails to acknowledge that the PRE-AUTH was SUCCESSFUL</li>
<li>Membership is denied, money is returned.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am trying to tell you that your online subscription page is broken!</p>
<p>And final repeat, just… for good measure (three times the charm, right?):<br>
The online subscription system is failing because successful pre-authorizations fail to be detected within your systems subscription back-end.</p>
<p>Or to put it bluntly:<br>
Runescape subscription system is fudgeed, please fix it, I would like to play this game.[/spoiler]</p>
<p>As you can see, neutron star levels of dense, is possible in humans. Who would’ve thought.</p>
<p>P.S. Mods name was in fact replaced with a peanut as I don’t intend to attack the mod. I am merely sharing in some wonderful Runescape 3 experience that I couldn’t have.<br>
P.P.S. I cannot play non-member worlds either because my bank is full of members items + It keeps shouting at me that I should subscribe.</p>
