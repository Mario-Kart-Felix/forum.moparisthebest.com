    <title>Weapon Specs</title>

    <description>For some odd reason, special attacks won&#39;t work on Players. They work perfectly fine on NPCs though. When you spec someone with a godsword, it does the regular hit emote, and the Spec&#39;s GFX. But on an NPC, it shows the Spec Emote and the GFX as well. Does anyone know what might be causing this..? Thanks! I&#39;m using a 317, delta base</description>
