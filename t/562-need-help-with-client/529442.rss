    <title>[562] Need help with client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-need-help-with-client/529442</link>
    <description>When i run a 562 server 2 things can happen depending on which client i use. If i use one client i cant connect to 127.0.0.1 even tho i should be able to. if i run another one i can log in but when i start walking my character ends up walking in a diagonal line straight trough objects. I have no idea how to fix both of these problems. anyone can help? No i am not a noob. if i run a server and it says listening on port 43594 that means i can connect trough localhost no matter what.

also i tried 5 diffrent clients and 4 servers all 562. it ended up in one of those problems stated above.
hope anyone can help! thanks in advance!</description>
