    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/finding-a-host-that-wont-shut-our-server-website-down/452446</link>
    <description>My team and I are almost done with our server development but now we are having difficulty&#39;s with finding a host that won&#39;t shut us down. we wan&#39;t to start with a windows vps around 25$/month max we thought about offshore hosting but most seem unreliable. If any of you know a host offshore/onshore that won&#39;t shut us down for hosting a rsps/webclient please let me know.

Thank you.</description>

Because private servers are open source, copyright infringement cannot (or should not?) be a problem. Jagex did not write private server code and therefore cannot claim that it is theirs. The only possible way for Jagex to shut your host down is that they can state that that some Java program on your computer just happens to be compatible with their RS(317?) client which just so happens to be on your website.</p>
<p>Read MITB’s discussion with Jagex’s lawyers. One of his points centered on the usage of links. Do not host the client on your webhost; instead, externally link it.</p>
<p>If anybody had past experiences with Jagex that proves my points false, please tell me about it.<br>

<p>What you’ve said is correct. There are no false statements in what you’ve said.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>:  There are way too many loopholes to worry about Jagex shutting you down.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m glad to hear this but I’m not scared of jagex really I just don’t wan’t my host to shut me down just like that.<br>
Like Iv’e heard that x10hosting auto shuts you down when hosting a webclient/server on their VPS’s.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ruby">@Ruby</a> they seem decent enough thanks ;d</p>
<p>I’m glad I made this post this very reassuring to me.</p>
