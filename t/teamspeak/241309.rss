    <description>Anybody use it? I&#39;m having some problems.

I&#39;m hosting a server, it&#39;s up and running like always. I can connect on my network but no one can externally. My firewall settings are all correct because it worked previously, but now all people get is the error message that my server is not running. I&#39;ve tried anything and everything I can think of, but I cannot find what&#39;s wrong.

I was going to try and use DynDNS, but I&#39;m not even sure how it works.

help? :/</description>

              <p>Maybe the server is running on localhost (127.0.0.1) instead of your public IP that others can access, that would cause your problem.</p>
