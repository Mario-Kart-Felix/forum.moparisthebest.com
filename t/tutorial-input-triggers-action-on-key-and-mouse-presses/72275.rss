    <title>Tutorial: Input Triggers (Action on key and mouse presses)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-input-triggers-action-on-key-and-mouse-presses/72275</link>
    <description>This is a tutorial to teach you how to take certain actions if a mouse button or a key is down. These aren&#39;t real triggers, per se, since you have to actually check if they&#39;re down, rather than action automatically being taken, although they function much in the same way. This is a simple program to show you how to use all of the user input checking functions of SCAR. I intended for this to simply teach how to check for input, but I expanded on it to cover some more in-depth programming concepts.

This tutorial covers:

[ul][li]Program Comments[/li]
[li]Integer to String Conversion[/li]
[li]Getting the System Time[/li]
[li]Repeat Loops[/li]
[li]Arguments[/li]
[li]Some Types[/li]
[li]Checking if an Arrow Key is Down[/li]
[li]Checking if a Function Key is Down[/li]
[li]Checking if a Mouse Button is Down[/li]
[li]Checking if a Letter or Number Key is Down[/li]
[li]Writing Text to the Debug Window[/li]
[li]Clearing the Debug Window[/li]
[li]Waiting[/li]
[li]Killing a Script[/li]
[li]Spacing[/li][/ul]


If you&#39;re reading this, then you should know certain things about the way I wrote this tutorial.

[b]Bold[/b] denotes key words, terminology, and object types.
[i]Italics[i] are used to emphasize a key point.
[u]Underlining[/u] is used to denote procedure names.

First, the entire code. If you think you can figure it out yourself using your brain and the comments, then you can just not read the rest of this tutorial, but for best understanding, I suggest you read this tutorial thoroughly.

[code]// Aftermath - 03/29/2007
// Input triggers - make your program do something when a key is down
// or a mouse button is down.

program MouseFunctions;
  // This is used to display the time in milliseconds since
  // 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970, according to your system time.
  function TimeStamp : String;
  begin
    result := IntToStr(GetSystemTime);
  end;
begin
  ClearDebug;
  repeat
    // IsMouseButtonDown checks if the left or right buttons are down.
    // It takes a boolean, whether the button you&#39;re checking is the left
    // one or not. True is left, false is right.
    If(IsMouseButtonDown(true)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: left mouse button is down!&#39;);
    If(IsMouseButtonDown(false)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: right mouse button is down!&#39;);

    // These are the keys on your keyboard labeled F1 to F12.
    // IsFKeyDown takes an integer between 1 and 12 and checks
    // if that FKey is down.
    If(IsFKeyDown(5)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: F5 key was pressed&#39;);
    
    // Here we check for modifier keys and function keys. These keys
    // are the shift, control, and alt keys. IsFunctionKeyDown takes
    // an integer between 0 and 8, to check if a certain function key
    // is down. 0 is shift, 1 is control, 2 is alt, 3 is the left shift
    // key, 4 is the left control key, 5 is the left alt key, 6 is right
    // shift, 7 is right control, and 8 is right alt. The keys without a
    // right or left modifier are triggered when either of the two buttons,
    // left or right, are pressed.
    If(IsFunctionKeyDown(2)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: You pressed ALT!&#39;);
    If(IsFunctionKeyDown(6)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: You pressed the right shift key!&#39;);

    // IsArrowKeyDown checks is a directional arrow key is pressed. These
    // are the left, up, right, and down keys on your keyboard. It takes
    // one integer parameter, between 0 and 3. 0 is up, 1 is right, 2 is
    // down, and 3 is left. If Num Lock is off, the keys marked with arrows
    // on the number pad are treated just as the regular arrow keys.
    If(IsArrowDown(2)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: You pressed the down arrow!&#39;);

    // Checking to see if a key is down is oneq of the most important triggers.
    // For example, you could make a script exit if you pressed a certain key.
    // You could also combine this with what you learned previously, so that
    // the Alt key and a letter key had to be down, or even a mouse button or
    // a key! It takes a Char parameter, so all you need to give it is a lower-
    // case letter or number in apostrophes. If it&#39;s a number, it has to be
    // typed with the numbers above the letters, not with the NumPad.
    If(IsKeyDown(&#39;f&#39;)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: You pressed F!&#39;);
    If(IsKeyDown(&#39;q&#39;)) Then Begin WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: You pressed Q! Quitting!&#39;); TerminateScript; end;

    // Just wait some time before doing this again so it&#39;s not to intensive and
    // your debug box isn&#39;t spammed.
    wait(100);
  until false
end.[/code]

Some starting comments - this is a good practice, since you will know who made the program if you look through your files again later, and the exact date you made it so you can keep track of your progress. It&#39;s also a good idea to write a comment to describe what your program does, just in case it doesn&#39;t seem immediately obvious.


[code]
// Aftermath - 03/29/2007
// Input triggers - make your program do something if a key or mouse button is down
[/code]


We&#39;re starting a new program called InputFunctions (You should know this by now  :rolleyes:)
[code]
program InputFunctions;
[/code]

This is just a function used to generate a textual representation of the number of milliseconds passed since [b]00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970[/b], according to your computer. It&#39;s just used to give a relative sense of the order you performed the actions. [u]GetSystemTime[/u] returns a [b]LongInt[/b] which is converted to a [b]String[/b] using [u]IntToStr[/u].

[code]
  function TimeStamp : String;
  begin
    result := IntToStr(GetSystemTime);
  end;
[/code]

This is the main body of the program, marked with [b]begin[/b]. [u]ClearDebug[/u] clears the [b]Debug Window[/b], the large box at the bottom of SCAR in which information about the program appears.

[code]
begin
  ClearDebug;
[/code]

This is a [b]repeat loop[/b] which will repeat a set of actions until a certain condition is true. A repeat loop is started using the keyword [b]repeat[/b], followed by a set of commands. It&#39;s ended with the [b]until[/b] keyword followed by a condition which has to evaluate to true for the loop to end. I used false as the until condition, which means that the loop will never end unless something in that block of code causes the script to terminate.

[code]
  repeat
[/code]

We use the [u]IsMouseButtonDown[/u] function to check to see if the right or left mouse buttons are down. It takes a [b]Boolean[/b] [b]argument[/b]. A Boolean is a value that is either true or false. An argument is data passed on to a procedure or a program that helps make decisions on what to do. If you pass a true value, it&#39;ll return whether or not the left mouse button is down. Otherwise, if you pass false, it returns whether or not the right mouse button is down. The [u]WriteLn[/u] procedure simply writes to the [b]Debug Box[/b], the box at the bottom of the SCAR window.

[code]
    If(IsMouseButtonDown(true)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: left mouse button is down!&#39;);
    If(IsMouseButtonDown(false)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: right mouse button is down!&#39;);
[/code]

[u]IsFKeyDown[/u] checks if the keys at the top of your keyboard labeled F1 to F12 are down. It takes an [b]Integer[/b] parameter between 1 to 12 (an Integer is a number without any decimal part), and returns whether the F-key with that number is down. This code just writes to the debug box when the F5 key is pressed.
[code]    If(IsFKeyDown(5)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: F5 key was pressed&#39;);[/code]
    
[u]IsFunctionKeyDown[/u] checks to see if specific function or modifier keys are down. These are the shift, alt, and control keys on your keyboard. It can check whether the left, right, or either button of a specific type is down. It takes an Integer parameter, which tells the function which key to check for. 0 is shift, 1 is control, 2 is alt, 3 is the left shift 
key, 4 is the left control key, 5 is the left alt key, 6 is right shift, 7 is right control, and 8 is the right alt key.

This code below checks to see is any alt key is down, followed by checking if the right shift key is down.
[code]    If(IsFunctionKeyDown(2)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: You pressed ALT!&#39;);
    If(IsFunctionKeyDown(6)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: You pressed the right shift key!&#39;);[/code]

The code below is used to check if the down arrow key was pressed using the [u]IsArrowKeyDown[/u] function, which takes an Integer from 0 to 3 to tell it which key to check for. 0 is up, 1 is right, 2 is down, and 3 is left. If Num Lock is off, then the NumPad keys marked with arrows are also treated as arrow keys.

[code]    If(IsArrowDown(2)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: You pressed the down arrow!&#39;);[/code]

Finally, we want to be able to know if a certain key is down. We use the [u]IsKeyDown[/u] function to do things like this. It takes a [b]Char[/b] parameter, which is represented by putting something like a letter or a number within apostrophes. If you want to do the check, you must type in a [i]lowercase[/i] letter. If you wish to check for numbers, you must know that this function only checks for the number keys above the regular keys, not the NumPad keys.

This code terminates the program using [u]TerminateScript[/u] if the Q key is down, and simply displays a message if the F key is down.
   [code]
    If(IsKeyDown(&#39;f&#39;)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: You pressed F!&#39;);
    If(IsKeyDown(&#39;q&#39;)) Then Begin WriteLn(TimeStamp + &#39;: You pressed Q! Quitting!&#39;); TerminateScript; end;[/code]

Then we just wait a period of time so that the Debug Box isn&#39;t flooded from repeated messages and so that the program isn&#39;t very CPU intensive. You use the [u]Wait[/u] function along with an Integer parameter which tells how many milliseconds to wait. 100 would be a tenth of a second.

[code]    wait(100);[/code]

Finally, we end the loop block that we started a while ago (you forgot, didn&#39;t you? :P) by telling it never to stop.
[code]  until false[/code]

This marks the end of our program :D
[code]end.[/code]

Hope you learned something ;)</description>

The <span class="bbcode-u">WriteLn</span> procedure simply writes to the <span class="bbcode-b">Debug Box</span>, the box at the bottom of the SCAR window.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    If(IsMouseButtonDown(true)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + ': left mouse button is down!');
    If(IsMouseButtonDown(false)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + ': right mouse button is down!');</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">IsFKeyDown</span> checks if the keys at the top of your keyboard labeled F1 to F12 are down. It takes an <span class="bbcode-b">Integer</span> parameter between 1 to 12 (an Integer is a number without any decimal part), and returns whether the F-key with that number is down. This code just writes to the debug box when the F5 key is pressed.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    If(IsFKeyDown(5)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + ': F5 key was pressed');</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">IsFunctionKeyDown</span> checks to see if specific function or modifier keys are down. These are the shift, alt, and control keys on your keyboard. It can check whether the left, right, or either button of a specific type is down. It takes an Integer parameter, which tells the function which key to check for. 0 is shift, 1 is control, 2 is alt, 3 is the left shift<br>
key, 4 is the left control key, 5 is the left alt key, 6 is right shift, 7 is right control, and 8 is the right alt key.</p>
<p>This code below checks to see is any alt key is down, followed by checking if the right shift key is down.</p>
<p><code>    If(IsFunctionKeyDown(2)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + ': You pressed ALT!');
    If(IsFunctionKeyDown(6)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + ': You pressed the right shift key!');</code></p>
<p>The code below is used to check if the down arrow key was pressed using the <span class="bbcode-u">IsArrowKeyDown</span> function, which takes an Integer from 0 to 3 to tell it which key to check for. 0 is up, 1 is right, 2 is down, and 3 is left. If Num Lock is off, then the NumPad keys marked with arrows are also treated as arrow keys.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    If(IsArrowDown(2)) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + ': You pressed the down arrow!');</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we want to be able to know if a certain key is down. We use the <span class="bbcode-u">IsKeyDown</span> function to do things like this. It takes a <span class="bbcode-b">Char</span> parameter, which is represented by putting something like a letter or a number within apostrophes. If you want to do the check, you must type in a <span class="bbcode-i">lowercase</span> letter. If you wish to check for numbers, you must know that this function only checks for the number keys above the regular keys, not the NumPad keys.</p>
<p>This code terminates the program using <span class="bbcode-u">TerminateScript</span> if the Q key is down, and simply displays a message if the F key is down.</p>
<p><code>
    If(IsKeyDown('f')) Then WriteLn(TimeStamp + ': You pressed F!');
    If(IsKeyDown('q')) Then Begin WriteLn(TimeStamp + ': You pressed Q! Quitting!'); TerminateScript; end;</code></p>
<p>Then we just wait a period of time so that the Debug Box isn’t flooded from repeated messages and so that the program isn’t very CPU intensive. You use the <span class="bbcode-u">Wait</span> function along with an Integer parameter which tells how many milliseconds to wait. 100 would be a tenth of a second.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    wait(100);</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we end the loop block that we started a while ago (you forgot, didn’t you? :P) by telling it never to stop.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">  until false</code></pre>
<p>This marks the end of our program <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">end.</code></pre>
<p>Hope you learned something <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
