    <description>Hey guys, I have a question. I&#39;m trying to make a command called &quot;helpdesk&quot; that when people type it they get teleported there, but at the same time, a special rank called &quot;hd mods&quot; get sent a message saying &quot;player needs help at helpdesk&quot;. Can someone point me in the right direction for this ?</description>

<p>Well first you would have to add a Help Desk Associate group (although, a helpdesk should not be created in game; it should only be created/used on the website). Then, create the command (teleport the player to your area, send a message to any online Help Desk Associates that their services are requested). That’s all there is to it. Granted, you could add some additional statements (prevent the player from moving, etc).</p>

<p>Or, “HD mod”. Whichever you prefer. There are tutorials for adding different groups on the site I believe. The search button can help you find one.[/quote]<br>
What would I even search for? How to add groups pi?<br>

<p>You would search for whatever you think would render the best results. If you don’t get what you’re looking for, modify the search terms and try again.</p>
