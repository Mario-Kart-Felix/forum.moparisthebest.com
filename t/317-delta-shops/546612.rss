    <title>317 Delta Shops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-shops/546612</link>
    <description>Let me start off by saying yes, I have done this before. This is seriously the easiest thing in the world. Basically I started back up again on servers and got a Delta because they are my favorite. Anyways while adding content I began to do shops. There was no wanneshops under case 155 so I made one myself:

[code]
			if (NPCID == 522) { // Varrock General
			PutNPCCoords = true;
			WanneShop = 1; //Id of shop
		}[/code]

Simple enough. Then going into shops.cfg I created the other part.

[code]
//-----ShopID---ShopName----------------------------------------Sell----Buy-----Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount--Item----Amount
shop = 1	General_Store					1	1	1038	100

[ENDOFSHOPLIST]
[/code]

Ran my server through my IDE and no errors. Upon clicking the npc nothing happens. Talk and trade do nothing. Now maybe its just me forgetting a step, but it&#39;s just not working. Could someone tell me if I forgot about something or a possible solution?
Thank you.


EDIT:
Okay so something weird just happened. I clicked trade on the shop keeper and it didn&#39;t work, so I clicked use quickly on my bank(which opens from far away because it needs to be fixed as well) and when my guy finally reached the bank the interface switched into his shop. I am very confused right now lol</description>
