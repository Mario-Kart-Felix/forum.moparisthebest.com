        <p>Lennox Lewis’s long-awaited meeting with Mike Tyson seemed less likely than ever Friday after the Lewis camp ruled out the possibility for the foreseeable future. A senior help to the WBC and IBF success insisted that the the show-down “was not going to happen” as the two fighters ended up contracted to rival television companies. Lewis is 2 fights into a seven-contest deal with cable company Cinemax , while Tyson has an agreement with rival system Showtime . “It’s a ridiculous contract – the Tyson fight will not go ahead,” said the aide. “He’s based into his own contract and it’s not going to take place.” The Lewis camping had suggested Thursday that the fight end up being screened on HBO , a proposal which would force Tyson to compensate Showtime out of his or her cut of the bag. Tyson’s manager Shelly Finkel said that Lewis’s demands on the split associated with television cash were “laughable,” adding that it was “clear that Lennox does not would like the fight.” A compromise which would see each cable companies screening the fight simultaneously seems unlikely. "It would be essentially impossible, as there is simply no financial incentive for that companies to do so,In . said industry specialist Tom Umstead of Adjustable Channel News. "They would need to go through the In Demand submission house or eliminate them. “If they did which, they would have to make a deal individually with thousands of cable operators themselves which would be extremely hard from a distribution perspective,” he included. Jason Oberlander, a publicist for Showtime, says the company ended up being willing to try to get to agreement with Cinemax . “Showtime is open to mediation. We are open to talks to work this out and about and see what we can do,” he said.(Chemical)2001 The Linked Press. All Legal rights Reserved.

Mexico inaugurates its new us president, Vicente Fox, later this week. Mr. Fox promises adjust.Haiti held elections this past weekend. Former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is apparently the winner.Canada’s prime minister, Jean Chretien, has been re-elected to a 3rd term. Peru’s embattled president, Alberto Fujimori, resigned while on a trip to Asia and has so far rejected to return to Lima. Secretary regarding State Madeleine Albright has delivered from a quick trip to Vienna where she held consultations with European leaders, though the girl wasn’t able to meet with Yugoslavia’s new president, Vojislav Kostunica.Prime Minister Ehud Barak has called for new elections in Israel, even as Israelis as well as Palestinians continue to kill one another  and, perhaps, kill any chance for tranquility between them anytime soon.Of course, there is much political news occurring within world capitals for anyone interested.  Here in Buenos aires no one seems to care about any of this, or much of anything else sometimes. Just tell us who won Florida, who really won Florida and, then, perhaps, we are able to all start transferring back to more life concerns.Diplomats are viewing the tug-of-war over the Bush-Gore vote count like everyone else. Providing the matter is in the tennis courts, the cables via Embassy Row back to the world’s foreign ministries are stuffed with speculation and supposition, explanations of how your electoral college and not the widely used vote is the important thing and maybe a few truthful confessions that most diplomats posted right here on temporary assignments are just as puzzled as the locals. Normally, a good diplomat doesn’t want to confess to the foreign reverend that he hasn’t an idea as to what these People in america are up to, in this case an honest assessment might be forgiven.Maybe it’s a good time to take a vacation.

While most Palestinians would like Israelis to withdraw from the Gulf Bank, CBS Media Correspondent Jesse Schulman reviews that some foreign investors are hoping a new casino might lure Israelis to travel to Jericho to try their own hand at the gaming tables. It’s a tiny slice of Nevada, near the banks in the River Jordan, and the biggest thing to hit Jericho considering that Joshua.It’s the $150-million Oasis Casino, now open with regard to business in the West Lender Palestinian town.The casino has been built with a consortium of Western european investors, and it’s previously providing hundreds of work opportunities for the local community. “It’s a really big opportunity for us,” says Alexander Tucek, representative general of Retreat Casino. "It’s a very big challenge to us, and it’s a very big chance of the area."Operators hope to entice gamblers from all over the entire world, but success depends on drawing their principal clientele from Israel. Jerusalem is simply half-hour’s drive away.Israelis like to gamble, and this is the only casino they have regarding hundreds of miles in a direction. Still, getting them to come to Palestinian territory for the big night out seems like a bit of a long photo.The casino combines into the biblical city about as well as a spacecraft from Mars. Jericho is a bad, agricultural backwater, and has been recently since time immemorial. It’s a location where international high-rollers certainly are a distinctly scarce item. Townspeople desperately need the careers the casino gives, but there is opposition.Your operators say they’ve already built casinos in stranger spots. These are confident Israelis will come, Palestinians can prosper, and traders will make a bundle. They could well be right, because the odds at a internet casino are always in the residence’s favor.  <a href="http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">gucci outlet store</a></p>
