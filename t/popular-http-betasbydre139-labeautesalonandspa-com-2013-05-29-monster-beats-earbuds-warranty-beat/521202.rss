    <description>Lennox Lewis&#39;s long-awaited meeting with Mike Tyson seemed less likely than ever Friday after the Lewis camp ruled out the possibility for the foreseeable future. A senior help to the WBC and IBF success insisted that the the show-down &quot;was not going to happen&quot; as the two fighters ended up contracted to rival television companies. Lewis is 2 fights into a seven-contest deal with cable company Cinemax , while Tyson has an agreement with rival system Showtime . &quot;It&#39;s a ridiculous contract -- the Tyson fight will not go ahead,&quot; said the aide. &quot;He&#39;s based into his own contract and it&#39;s not going to take place.&quot; The Lewis camping had suggested Thursday that the fight end up being screened on HBO , a proposal which would force Tyson to compensate Showtime out of his or her cut of the bag. Tyson&#39;s manager Shelly Finkel said that Lewis&#39;s demands on the split associated with television cash were &quot;laughable,&quot; adding that it was &quot;clear that Lennox does not would like the fight.&quot; A compromise which would see each cable companies screening the fight simultaneously seems unlikely. &quot;It would be essentially impossible, as there is simply no financial incentive for that companies to do so,In . said industry specialist Tom Umstead of Adjustable Channel News. &quot;They would need to go through the In Demand submission house or eliminate them. &quot;If they did which, they would have to make a deal individually with thousands of cable operators themselves which would be extremely hard from a distribution perspective,&quot; he included. Jason Oberlander, a publicist for Showtime, says the company ended up being willing to try to get to agreement with Cinemax . &quot;Showtime is open to mediation. We are open to talks to work this out and about and see what we can do,&quot; he said.(Chemical)2001 The Linked Press. All Legal rights Reserved.

Still, getting them to come to Palestinian territory for the big night out seems like a bit of a long photo.The casino combines into the biblical city about as well as a spacecraft from Mars. Jericho is a bad, agricultural backwater, and has been recently since time immemorial. It&#39;s a location where international high-rollers certainly are a distinctly scarce item. Townspeople desperately need the careers the casino gives, but there is opposition.Your operators say they&#39;ve already built casinos in stranger spots. These are confident Israelis will come, Palestinians can prosper, and traders will make a bundle. They could well be right, because the odds at a internet casino are always in the residence&#39;s favor.
