    <title>The point system for women</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-point-system-for-women/350415</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;For thousands of years, men have tried to understand the rules of dealing with women. At last this points guide will help you to understand just how it works. 

AIM: 

Make the woman happy. Do something she likes, and you get points. 
Do something she dislikes and points are subtracted. 

You don&#39;t get any points for doing something she expects. 

Sorry, that&#39;s just the way the game&#39;s played. 

Here&#39;s a guide to the points system:
