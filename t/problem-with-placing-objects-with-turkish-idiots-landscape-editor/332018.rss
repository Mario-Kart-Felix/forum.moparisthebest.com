    <title>Problem with placing object&#39;s with turkish idiots landscape editor</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-placing-objects-with-turkish-idiots-landscape-editor/332018</link>
    <description>So i was using turkish idiot&#39;s 3d landscape editor. I was just playing around with it trying to place objects. I right clicked on a tile where a chair was and copied the temp9 and temp10 from the chair and right clicked on a blank tile next to the lumbridge castle and added the temp9 and temp10 to the tile. The red symbol came up saying their was a object their (the chair). I also edited the land to a wooden floor so i could see where i placed it. I saved the tiles and added it to my landscape.rscd. I threw the landscape into my client and server and compiled and ran the server and started the client. I logged in and went to the tile. Their was a wooden floor their but no chair. I went back and looked at the tile in the 3d landscape editor and it still said their was a object their. Does anyone have an idea whats wrong.</description>

              <p>the landscape editor loads an gameobjects.xml.gx(or whatever the compression file name is) from a serperate file that your client runs. objects are not stored in the landscape, but rather hosted on your server.</p>

<p>No idea, but you don’t need to compile when you edit landscape files… Or even .xml …</p>
