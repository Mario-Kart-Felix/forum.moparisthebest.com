    <title>VpS Land Wait Time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vps-land-wait-time/350446</link>
    <description>Hello there ladies and gentlemen, I have recently ordered a VPS from &quot;www.vpsland.com&quot;
They normally take about 24 hours to get the VPS set up for you, as it has taken for the past 3-4 Times I&#39;ve bought from them.
But this time it has taken alot longer. Since I ordered and Payed for it about 65 hours ago, I just want to know if this is a normal wait time, and, possibly to relate to this situation, give the longest time you&#39;ve waited for them. Thanks -Skorge</description>

              <p>65 Hours seems like quite along time for them to set it up. You should get it checked in case something went wrong.</p>
