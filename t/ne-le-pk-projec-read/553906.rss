    0 Kill-count requirement to enter God Wars Dungeon bosses (Default is 25 kill-count) ( depending on rank ).
    Chance of double drops in PVM, just as if they were wearing a ring of wealth, but they don&#39;t need to wear it. (This doesn&#39;t mean that if you do wear one it&#39;s 4x&#39;d) ( depending on rank )

The Donator zone even as an owner, i will say, is cruddy; It gives poor benefits to donators.
I&#39;m not going to add anything stupid, that gives Donators a massive unfair advantage over others, hence the above mentioned is not going to ruin the economy, nor non-donators game play.

Donator Benefits:

The benefits that are to come will involve ,

    Points rewarded per Pest Control game, will be increased depending on rank
    Loyalty points gained, will be increased depending on rank
    Possibility to catch 2 fish per action , depending on rank
    10 % smaller chance of burning food, depending on rank
    15% chance to burn an additional log while firemaking, giving you twice the XP.
    0 Kill-count requirement to enter God Wars Dungeon bosses (Default is 25 kill-count) ( depending on rank ).
    Chance of double drops in PVM, just as if they were wearing a ring of wealth, but they don't need to wear it. (This doesn't mean that if you do wear one it's 4x'd) ( depending on rank )

The Donator zone even as an owner, i will say, is cruddy; It gives poor benefits to donators.
I'm not going to add anything stupid, that gives Donators a massive unfair advantage over others, hence the above mentioned is not going to ruin the economy, nor non-donators game play.</code></pre>
