    <description>soooooooooooooooooo,,, heres what ive got

the rune warfare source and client

im using it to practice coding, and i have no idea what im doing

but to start off to help me out, i need help with the following:
add these codes: mypos, bank, pickup (item, amount), tele #### ####.

incase u want to know for some reason, i want to add my own models so i need pickup to spawn them, tele to explore for npcs and home bases, my pos cuz idk where i am lol, and bank to bank extra stuff to drop later.

and also where can i find the file to change the exp rate for all stats, and add ::lunar to swap to that spell book?

anyone who can help out, id really appreciate it.
thanks
(just call me joey instead of oldtorsnewtops)

edit: i also want to add teleport commands like ::home, ::fally, ::varrock, etc. if theres a guide to teleport commands, can u link me to it, or just tell me how to add it? thanks

edit2: how do i make staves like staff of fire, have unlimited fire runes?</description>
