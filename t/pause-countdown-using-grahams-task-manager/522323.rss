    <title>Pause Countdown using Graham&#39;s Task Manager</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pause-countdown-using-grahams-task-manager/522323</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently trying to create a type of random event and I&#39;m using Graham&#39;s Task Manager. However, I&#39;m having a problem using countdown. I&#39;m trying to make the countdown stop if a player speaks to a certain NPC, however the countdown continues to decrement after the player speaks to the NPC. I tried a cheap-fix, but it didn&#39;t work.
[code=Java]
        /**
	 * Starts the countdown for the NPC. 
	 */
	@Override
	public void execute() {
		if (countdown &gt; 0) {
			countdown --;
		}
		if (countdown == 70) 
			NPCHandler.forceChat(410, c.playerName + &quot;, speak to me.&quot;);
		if (countdown == 65) 
			NPCHandler.forceChat(410, &quot;Hey &quot; + c.playerName + &quot;, talk to me!&quot;);
		if (countdown == 61)
			NPCHandler.forceChat(410, &quot;You&#39;re going to make me angry.&quot;);
		if (countdown == 58)
			NPCHandler.forceChat(410, &quot;Now you&#39;ve done it!&quot;);
		if (countdown == 55)
			this.failed();
		if (countdown == 50)
			println(&quot;This is working.&quot;);
		if (countdown == 1)
			this.failedPuzzle();
	}
[/code]
The cheap fix was to have it countdown from a higher number (70) and if the player didn&#39;t click the NPC by the time the countdown was at 55, the task would end. If the player did click the NPC, the countdown would go to 54 and continue decrementing. The println was to alert me that it correctly went to 54 and was continuingly decrementing. However, when a player clicked the NPC, countdown wouldn&#39;t go to 54. 

Any ideas? I&#39;d much rather have the ability to stop the countdown in general, but if the only way is the cheap fix, that&#39;s fine too.</description>

boolean hasClickedNPC = false;<br>
and as long as it’s false, the countdown goes. But if it’s true, the count down stays static:</p>
<p><code>
boolean hasClickedNPC = false;
if(countdown &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; hasClickedNPC == false)
countdown --;
else
//Nothing goes here, you don't really need the else statement.

I’ve tried that before and it doesn’t work. That was one of my other previous attempts of a cheap fix.</p>
