    <title>Want To Be A Aprentice In RSPS Development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/want-to-be-a-aprentice-in-rsps-development/390293</link>
    <description>Hey Everyone,

My name is Wilddar, but you can call me Rob. I didn&#39;t know where to post this so I am posting it here. This topic is about me wanting to know fully, on how to create a RSPS.

Some examples I would like to know are:

Understanding the code that makes the server.
Adding NPC&#39;s
Adding Shops
Making new Teleports
Adding Minigames
Adding New Skills
Adding Objects
Adding Welcome Messages
Creating new Commands
Creating New Sections only accessible to Donators/Moderators/etc
Adding Quests

Stuff like that. I am willing to learn first off, and I will follow the directions that you give me the best I can. I pretty much asking a experienced coder of Rsps to teach me to pretty much be able to create a server, from a blank source, without errors. This may take a long time, but I would really like to learn, and I have the will to learn. I would only be available every other week, so you would get a break from teaching me one week then teach me the next. Like I said I just want to know the art and trade of creating a rsps.

Please respond, If you are willing to teach me, and if you are please add my msn: Blade1944@live.com

Thanks so much! :)</description>

</aside>
<p>That’s not teaching him anything. That’s telling him what methods to call in order achieve a certain result. It’s like going to school on a Monday, having the teacher say “1 + 1 = 2. Tell me this Friday and you pass.” You’re not helping them at all by telling them this. In fact you’re further hindering their advancement.</p>
<p>Instead, he should learn how to use Java as more than the language used to “code RSPS”. As many others will say, learning a programming language by way of a Private Server (especially Delta based) teaches bad programming practices. And for most people, it’s hard to unlearn.</p>

              <p>Instead of creating a thread about how to “code RSPS”, you should instead by learning from the various resources how to program using Java. Knowing that information will serve you much better in the future than knowing how to “code RSPS”. The reason you will learn very little with this thread, is because the things that you want to know how to do vary greatly between sources. If you know how to program in Java, then the questions you have answer themselves.</p>
