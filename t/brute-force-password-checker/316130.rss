    <title>Brute force password checker!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/brute-force-password-checker/316130</link>
    <description>Okay so basically what my tool does is that you MUST download the servers client , and once its open and running log ingame look for a mod or admin and get its user .

then after that log out the account and open up my brute force ip logger and run it with the client from the servers , so that it auto matically uses the connection from the client to the brute force logger, than you just type the mod or admins password, and  pick a password list (max of 10k passwords - *10mins to check through all* and then if the admins or mods password fits in with any passwords in the password list the brute force tool will show you the password.

i was over at my friends house and he has it and uses it for  deltascape, 2 specced, and nrpk ive watched him hack countless accounts, but hes being a fucking nerd and says he doesnt want to give me, so anyone have any ideas on how to start this mess?????

<p>Hehe, good luck finding a list of working SOCKS5 proxies.  Been there, done that.  You can manually search for them, and after checking a list of about 20, you can find 1 that works and then it will stop working shortly.[/quote]</p>
<p>SOCKS’5’? i just used a socks proxy list, and im like 80% sure java has it’s own class.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">                InetSocketAddress dest = new InetSocketAddress(server, port);//final destenation...lol
                SocketAddress addr = new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 9050);//location of proxy server...all connections sent here to be sent else where
                Proxy proxy = new Proxy(Proxy.Type.SOCKS, addr);//proxy server type
                Socket socket = new Socket(proxy);//connect to proxy destenation
                socket.connect(dest);//use proxy to connect to destenation</code></pre>
