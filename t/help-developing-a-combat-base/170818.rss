    <title>[Help] Developing a combat base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-developing-a-combat-base/170818</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m working off a Blank Base (Untouched), I&#39;ve done alot of work with it, but now I&#39;m attempting to add Combat (Malee) I will write Handlers for Magic + Range.

I&#39;ve been trying to modify an existing base (Pimpscape) To no avail;

So, What I&#39;m asking for is if someone can give me a &quot;Bare&quot; Base, that compiles fine. but doesn&#39;t have to much - So I can modify it properly to fit my needs, so just the &quot;FrameWork&quot; of a combat base.

If anyone has a blank source and has written a framework for it, I&#39;d be grateful for it. Also I can understand posting a framework - And having people leach it would be annoying. So if you would like to Pm me an upload link or the code that`d be fine aswell.

Like I said, Just the basics. I really do [u]not[/u] want a full combat code, as I prefer to do some stuff myself, or else I`ll learn absolutly nothing. I&#39;d like to be able to see what it does and how it does it. So a full base would&#39;nt help me.

If you can help me, I appreciate it. If you can`t but know a tutorial / persons that can. Please post a method of getting ahold of such person, or a link to the tutorial.

If you do not understand what I am asking for, please do not post as it increases spam. Simply Pm me.

         Many Thanks,

	if (attackNpc &gt; 0)
		{
			message (&quot;You are already under attack.&quot;);
		} else {
			attackNpc = inStream.readUnsignedWordA();
					server.npcHandler.npcs[attacknpc].StartKilling = playerId;
					server.npcHandler.npcs[attacknpc].RandomWalk = false;
					server.npcHandler.npcs[attacknpc].IsUnderAttack = true;
