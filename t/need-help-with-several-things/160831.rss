    <description>Hey, i&#39;d appriciate it if you could tell me how to do/fix the following:

-Fix teleports, when you click them nothing happens...
-Display coords under running energy, theres nothing there...
-Make it so Energy decreases/increases over time, it always stays at 100%...

--== Also if anyone has WorldObjects.cfg for Runescape Blitz 2.75 i&#39;d appriciate it!! I dont have one, i only have a WorldObjects.class and WorldObjects.java. So some of my servers landscape turns black, and many of the addition features dont work, (pest control, etc).

Server Base: Runescape Blitz 2.75

Thanks - Appriciated  ;D[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 25, 2007, 10:42:09 PM[/size][hr]Also, the login screen, how can i get the character appearance screen to pop up?
