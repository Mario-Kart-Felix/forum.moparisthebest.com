    <title>[Team_Rocket] Enchanting Skill [Concept]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/team-rocket-enchanting-skill-concept/475296</link>
    <description>Since this Concept was leaked, here it is:


Enchantment Skill: This is a newly introduced Skill to R.S.P.S. This Skill enables Players to customize their Equipment and Items to be more effective. Once something is Enchanted, it can no longer be Traded. Enchantments CANNOT be removed, however they can always be replaced by other Enchantments.




Platebody Enchantments -

- Golden Magnetism (level 1): Enchants a Platebody to automatically pick up Coins off the ground once a Monster has been killed and place them inside the Player&#39;s Inventory.

- Beast Master (level 25): Monsters below Combat Level 60 will never be aggresive towards the Player.

- Beast Commander (level 25): Monsters below Combat Level 60 will attack the Player on sight. All monsters below Combat Level 60 become aggresive towards the Player.

- Deflection (level 40): Automatically deals a very small percentage of damage back to the Attacker whenever the Player is attacked. This can be compared to the Ring of Recoil (which no longer exists at all).

- Dragonkin (level 60): Dragons of all types are no longer aggresive towards the Player. This does NOT include Boss N.P.C. This DOES include Mini-Boss N.P.C.

- Dragon Soul (level 60): 10 Hitpoints are restored each time the Player kills a Dragon N.P.C. This applies to all Dragons.

- Bloom (level 75): Increases the normal rate of Hitpoint regeneration by x3.

- Faith Bloom (level 75): Adds an additional Prayer Point each time a Player&#39;s Prayer is restored in any manner.

- Undead Commander (level 85): Each time the Player attacks an Undead N.P.C. the Player pushes the N.P.C. back one Tile.

- Ultima (level 96): Automatically cures negative de-buffs and effects as soon as they are applied; such as: Poison, Burn, and Drowning.




Plateleg Enchantments -

- Enhanced Agility (level 15): Allows the Player to gain access to certain areas which require an Item to access them. Such as a Rope to access the Godwars Dungeon.

- Fast Journey (level 30): Automatically skips Travel Effects and cinematics. The Player is made aware of when this occurs.

- Sturdy Stance (level 50): Pushback effects equivelent to 1 Tile are automatically negated and do not affect the Player.

- Grace (level 90): Increases the maximum Run Energy from 100% to 110%.

- Energy Rift (level 99): The Run Energy restore rate is increased by x5 when a Player is Following another Player.





Glove Enchantments -

- Small Hands (level 70): Increases your chances to Pickpocket any N.P.C. successfuly by 5%.

- Green Thumbs (level 80): Allows the Player to identify Herbs regardless of their Herblore Level.

- Sturdy Grip (level 93): Disarm effects no longer have an effect on the Player.





Helmet Enchantments -


- Blinding Gaze (level 99): For the first 5 seconds of combat, a N.P.C. will always hit 0 on the Player.




Ring Enchantments -


- Bind Ring (level 88): A Ring with this enchantment will always be kept upon Death by the Player no matter the circumstances.</description>

<p>I actually play World of Warcraft. The only ones I can see that would be similar are the Disarm and Bloom. When they were being thought up, I actually considered how close to World of Warcraft they seem (mostly the names I suppose). Enchanting is always one of my Professions on World of Warcraft, but none of these are exactly the same to World of Warcraft. The same basic Concepts? Sure. We could say that Battlefield and Call of Duty are the same because the concept is killing another person.<br>

<p>Ah, you’re correct then.</p>
