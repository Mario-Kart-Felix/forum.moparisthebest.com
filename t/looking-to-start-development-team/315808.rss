    <title>Looking to start development team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-start-development-team/315808</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m back and now have my bs in Java Programming !!!! anyway, I&#39;m looking to start a team for 100% G/E on 317. 
I have already written fully fuctional code on figmentscape base for G/E.
I am looking for 2 to 3 more people to work on this project with me.
Requirements:
1. Interface specialist.
2. PHP/Web specialist.

If you meet either of the requirements and are interested in joining this team then great!

Here is what i&#39;m looking to do... Have a programmer thats good with interfaces create + addin all interfaces for G/E. Then I will implement the code for the G/E. The PHP is not a required slot I would just like to implement some sort of G/E over web also.

Just to show you a little piece of what I already have here you go:
[code]private BufferedWriter grandExchangeBufferedWriter;
private File grandExchangeCharacterFileEditor;
private File grandExchangeItemFile;
private FileReader grandExchangeFileReader;
private int grandExchangeItemPrice;
private int grandExchangeTempItemPrice;
private String[] grandExchangeData;
private String[] grandExchangeFiles;
private String grandExchangeItemsSeller;
private String grandExchangeTextLine;

public void grandExchange(int Item) {
    
    grandExchangeItemFile = new File(&quot;./Grand Exchange/&quot; + Item + &quot;.txt&quot;);

    if(grandExchangeItemFile.exists()) {

        grandExchangeFileReader = new FileReader(grandExchangeItemFile);
        grandExchangeBufferedReader = new BufferedReader(grandExchangeFileReader);
	grandExchangeTextLine = grandExchangeBufferedReader.readLine();
	grandExchangeItemPrice = 999999999;

	while(grandExchangeItemFileEnd != true) {
	
	    grandExchangeData = grandExchangeTextLine.split(&quot;/&quot;);
	    grandExchangeTempItemPrice = Integer.parseInt(grandExchangeData[0].trim());
	
	    if(grandExchangeTempItemPrice &lt; grandExchangeItemPrice) {
		
		grandExchangeItemPrice = grandExchangeTempItemPrice;
		grandExchangeItemsSeller = grandExchangeData[1].trim();

	    }

	}
	
	grandExchangeBufferedReader.close();
	grandExchangeFileReader.close();

    }

}[/code]</description>
