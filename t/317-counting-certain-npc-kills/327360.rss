    <title>[317] Counting certain npc kills</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-counting-certain-npc-kills/327360</link>
    <description>Hey all,

I&#39;m working on a quest, where the player needs to kill a few monsters to earn a reward.
I already got the progress saving done, but now I need to find out how to make the counter go up when the player kills the correct NPC.

Now on Delta, i know you should use:
[code]
Client temp = (Client) PlayerHandler.players[npcs[i].getKiller()];
if ((temp != null) &amp;&amp; !temp.disconnected) {

if ((npcs[i].npcType == 1) &amp;&amp; (temp.startQ == 1) &amp;&amp; (temp.Men &lt; 5)) {
temp.Men += 1;
}
// and then some [/code]

However, Delta is crap so I aint using that. I&#39;m going back to basics, and therefor using Phonescape, just like 2 years ago.
The problem is, now I don&#39;t know how to make the counter go up :p

I found the place where the death of NPC, and the actions that go with it are controlled (in NPCHandler.java), namely (or atleast, i think that&#39;s it.  If not please say so!:
[code]
else if (npcs[i].IsDead == true) {
// do stuff
[/code]

Now i just need to know, how do I let NPCHandler edit a variable in client.java?

Regards,
