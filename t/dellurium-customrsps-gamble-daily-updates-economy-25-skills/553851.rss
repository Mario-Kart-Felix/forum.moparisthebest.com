Dellurium is a brand new server myself and my partner Pavel decided to start to give people a proper home. We both have been fed up with the way these &quot;popular&quot; servers have been run and have decided to show the community how a real server should be run properly. No community neglect will be ensued, we WILL have daily updates, whether it&#39;s content or minor fixes mixed with content. We only focus on the community, and their input because it&#39;s their ideas that keep us going in a custom direction. We will not focus solely on donations, nor spend ampule time on Donations, because we both work 40+ hours a week to provide for ourselves and this server. Money is not a necessity, the community being happy is our main goal. We will never consider ourselves better than the next, neither of us consider ourselves God-Coders, we do this as a hobby, and hope to provide the best home for people interested in new paths to an unique server and opportunity. Any coder can create a great server, but it&#39;s far more intricate when focusing on how a server should be run properly.

At Dellurium we choose our staff team carefully. We chose people who are not only mature, but not naive. We have an amazing staff team, with a humble community. Our leadership is just as important as our community to us, because we know players lead by example. If people you look up to or listen to act in a certain way, you&#39;re more inclined to act in that matter. This is why we choose carefully, and our focus is to have the most humble RSPS community out! We could never go over 30 active members, but I&#39;ll take 30 active members that are modest, than to have 1,000 active members whom are a constant problem.
