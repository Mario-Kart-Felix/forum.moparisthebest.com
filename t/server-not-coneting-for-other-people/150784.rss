    <title>Server Not Coneting For Other People?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-not-coneting-for-other-people/150784</link>
    <description>OKthis is what I did.
I got a server source.
I extracted the files to my Desktop.
I got an IP.(This might be the part wrong)
I dont know for shore if i got JDK(can you give me a link so I can redownload and install it)
I am running it on Silab.
And when I was done getting the IP it said server is now up thingy(I didn&#39;t say what it really said when it said it got up)
I ran the server and I went to my freinds house across the street and tried to get on but it didn&#39;t work.
I can only get on at my house for some reason.
(PS:I am postin this for a freind cause he is too lazy to post it himself so i am just doing it for him.And these are the exact same thing I did to run MY server)
But it just wont work at his house for some reason.
(PS AGAIN:I did all this server work for him so I know I what happened)

                                   CAN YOU HELP</description>
