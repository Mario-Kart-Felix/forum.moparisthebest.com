    <title>Bowling for Columbine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bowling-for-columbine/148097</link>
    <description>It is a documentary Directed by Michael Moore.

It is a review of the Columbine Shooting and gun violence in the United States compared to other countries.

I highly recommend that everyone watches it, not only is it educational, but it shows you that when you say something like &quot;Bitch, epic fail I&#39;m gonna go in your school and kill all your classmates.&quot;, you can horrify some people.  It was a very sad and dramatic video and I almost was pretty disturbed and sad during some parts.

Anyway, that is a movie that I believe has a good influence on people who watch it.

I hope someone watches it...</description>

              <p>I’ve seen this, I still remember, in Utah, you got a free gun when you opened a bank account at this bank, and the guy said “Don’t you think it’s kinda dangerous handing out guns in a bank!?”. I still lol about that.</p>
