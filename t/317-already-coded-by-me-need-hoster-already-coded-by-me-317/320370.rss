    <description>Hello my Moparscapian friends. I first got interested in Moparscape about a year ago, and slowly, I have learned. Now, I know how to code almost anything. I started with a 317 server named Fatality, and I was hosting it. In a day, it grew up 10 people. Then for some reason, my brother turned off the router (he has the main router, i have a wireless connection to the main router in his room). Now I can&#39;t host anymore. So If you could tell me how to fix everything so I can host again, or if you could help me host. We could talk about your benefits for hosting my server I created/coded. Here are some screenies of the server (On localhost)
