    <title>Few questions about this whole official server stuff and the rules</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-questions-about-this-whole-official-server-stuff-and-the-rules/376828</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t play minecraft at all but just out thought, shouldn&#39;t the authorities on the minecraft server be authorities on the forums to regulate it.
I just find it a bit fucked up that it&#39;s Moparscape&#39;s server and it&#39;s ran and operated by people that are not forum leaders here.
From my knowledge this is ran by Davidi2, although i have no problems with this fine fellow, i lack to see why he&#39;s running this operation.

I think maybe an administrator or a moderator here should step in and be the leading authority in this department, because i&#39;m sure if i played this game i wouldn&#39;t be comfortable knowing the people that ran it are just two random people.

And another thing.. how come davidi2 gets to have his own server and have advertisement for it all to themselves and have the right to call it &quot;the official server&quot;? wouldn&#39;t it be fair if everyone on the forum could have there own server and advertise it here?

Again, i don&#39;t have much room to talk because myself i don&#39;t even play minecraft and i know little of the game.</description>

and if they’res only going to be one, and you’re administrating it, you should have a title or something “Minecraft administrator” or something like that. Not saying it would give you any powers here on the forum.</p>

<p>I guess you could also add that I have some hosting experience, having hosted various types of servers (webservers, private runescape servers etc) over the past couple years.</p>

How come you get to make the server? and if you’re going to administrate part of this websites community shouldn’t you have a rank here that seperates you from the common forum user?</p>
<p>And i say it’s “fucked up” because it’s Moparscape’s minecraft server, which makes it part of moparscape.<br>
[/quote]Why shouldn’t I be able to make the server? I think it’s been stated that having a staff position here isn’t a ‘reward’ that makes you better than everyone else, it means that you have a new duty to protect the integrity and cleanliness of the forum.</p>
<p>I had the tools needed to run a functional server, so we took advantage of them. Now that the server is more popular, we are taking advantage of some better tools of Mopar’s to allow us to host an even bigger server.</p>
<p>[/quote]Why shouldn’t <span class="bbcode-b">I</span> be able to make a server and have it advertised here and hosted by moparscape? what makes you have more importance here then me? (although i have no intention of doing so)<br>
I’m not saying you’re doing a bad job or aren’t cut out for this, i’m just saying why you?<br>
[/quote]If you had the tools to host the server, by all means it could have been you. I had the tools readily available, and the server was online within an hour.<br>
[/quote]Let’s say i did and do have the tools? in all honesty i think i should be able to make a server and advertise it here if you’re going to be able to.[/quote]No one said you wouldn’t have been able to. But the fact is, you <span class="bbcode-b">didn’t</span> have the tools or experience.</p>

              <p>How come you get to make the server? and if you’re going to administrate part of this websites community shouldn’t you have a rank here that seperates you from the common forum user? If i played i’m sure i wouldn’t want my administrator to be an average forum user.</p>
<p>And i say it’s “fucked up” because it’s Moparscape’s minecraft server, which makes it part of moparscape.</p>

              <p>The server will be transferred to the current host server of Moparscape (owned by Moparisthebest)</p>
<p>Also, I made the server solely to be used by members of MoparScape, I didn’t have an already running server that I then advertised here. I had an unused linux box, and then I offered it up as the host.</p>
<p>It was approved by Moparisthebest (and as you can see he made this board for us), which is why we started calling it ‘official’.</p>
<p>I don’t see how it’s ‘fucked up’, because Minecraft is not Moparscape.</p>

              <p>I don’t play minecraft at all but just out thought, shouldn’t the authorities on the minecraft server be authorities on the forums to regulate it.<br>
I just find it a bit fucked up that it’s Moparscape’s server and it’s ran and operated by people that are not forum leaders here.<br>
From my knowledge this is ran by Davidi2, although i have no problems with this fine fellow, i lack to see why he’s running this operation.</p>
<p>I think maybe an administrator or a moderator here should step in and be the leading authority in this department, because i’m sure if i played this game i wouldn’t be comfortable knowing the people that ran it are just two random people.</p>
<p>And another thing… how come davidi2 gets to have his own server and have advertisement for it all to themselves and have the right to call it “the official server”? wouldn’t it be fair if everyone on the forum could have there own server and advertise it here?</p>
<p>Again, i don’t have much room to talk because myself i don’t even play minecraft and i know little of the game.</p>
