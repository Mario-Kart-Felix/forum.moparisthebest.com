    <description>I decided to start a hyperion 459 server, and I want to know how to add skills AKA WC Fishing Firemaking. I saw someone talking about packets, and im not sure what they meant. If someone could tell me or point me in the direction of a guide on how to add skills to a hyperion server that would be amazing.</description>
