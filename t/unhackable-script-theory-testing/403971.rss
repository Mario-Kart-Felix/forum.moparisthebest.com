    <title>&#39;Unhackable&#39; script? Theory testing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unhackable-script-theory-testing/403971</link>
    <description>[center]Yes, this is yet another person that believes his system in &#39;unhackable&#39;.[/center]

So this guy (nickname Potential) is a scripter. Means that, in this case, he writes Runescape scripts for an existing bot platform.
And in this &#39;new version of his script&#39;, he is using a repository of paths, which means his script will send the player&#39;s current location to his server, and his server will respond with the path to go to the client&#39;s destination as fast as possible.

[b]To make it simple:[/b]
- Client is in city A, needs to go to B.
- Client sends that info to the server.
- Server responds with fastest path from A to B.


[b]Potential&#39;s statement:[/b]
He claims his system is &#39;uncrackable&#39;, and that you can, in no way, record the data that is sent to the client to later use those paths for your own reasons. So he says it&#39;s impossible to get access to the data that is sent to the client.

[b]My statement:[/b]
It is perfectly possible. I will even share some theories as to how it can be done.



[b]My theories:[/b]
[b]Theory #1a[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Run wireshark (packet sniffer), capture the traffic sent between server and client, save it. There you go.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[b]Theory #1b[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let&#39;s assume the server is running SSL, so you can&#39;t just use Wireshark to read the data (it&#39;ll be encrypted).
In that case, launch a MitM (man-in-the-middle) attack on yourself and spoof the SSL connection between client and server, then run Wireshark and capture the packets anyway.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[b]Theory #2[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;At this point, Potential is starting to come up with excuses and can only repeatedly say &quot;IT IS NOT POSSIBLE&quot; and that I should stop making up theories. And he adds: the data is encrypted (not talking about SSL here). So I supposedly can&#39;t get access to it.

So I explain:
Write a program (I&#39;m a programmer, let&#39;s assume everyone is) that snapshots the current memory state of the running script (his script) when idle and that makes more snapshots as you give the script the command to run (so that it&#39;ll start receiving the paths).

The client asks for the paths &gt; the server sends the paths to the client &gt; client receives them encrypted and decrypts them &gt; decrypted paths are used in memory &gt; memory snapshot can record the decrypted data.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


And after this statement, he challenged me to post my theories on Moparisthebest! So here I am, waiting for your opinion.



[center][b]What do you think? &#39;Unhackable&#39;? Or not so much?[/b][/center]



And I quote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[21:50] &lt;&amp;Potential&gt; go to mitb and post how are you planning on decrypting my system please
[21:51] &lt;&amp;Potential&gt; even @ google people will have a good laugh at you&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Potential, let’s clear a few things up:</p>
<p>First of all: Honestly, most of what you wrote is an attempt to twist the meaning of words I’ve said or attempts to just completely change everything and make me say things I never actually said.</p>
<p>First paragraph: You were boasting about your fighter. You started that conversation by asking biking how he was doing on his fighter, then switching to yours to get the attention to you. Biking even told you to shut up that time.</p>
<p>Second paragraph: The wilderness thing is irrelevant. Secondly: as you just confirmed, you stated getting the paths is impossible.</p>
<p>3rd and 4th paragraph: Nowhere have I bragged about hacking anything. I stated that you were incorrect when stating it is impossible, and have given you some theories to support that statement (all which can be read in the IRC logs). Next, I do not use powerbot and/or have never been part of it’s community, so I don’t know why you are referring to powerbot. You are also an <span class="bbcode-b">arrogant little kid for saying these words:</span> “and usually script-writers listen to me  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> so I though if I told him it’s not possible, he would shut up”.</p>
<p>Please, do get off your high horse and understand you are not some powerful wizard with the ability to control anyone. I think I proved that as well.</p>
<p>The next part about returning things in programming functions is simple: the basic concept of having a main() function is that it’s the function that will be called when the program is ran. If a program returns 0, it has successfully executed. Any other value can be considered an error code, depending on the circumstances. All this has to do with basic programming, and is <span class="bbcode-b">completely irrelevant to any of the ‘hacking it is impossible’ statement you made</span> and is also not what this thread is about.</p>
<p>As for my so-said ‘rage’ about the IRC protocol, it is even simpler: You had copied a log message in the channel that was in the format of the IRC protocol: "PRIVMSG <span class="hashtag">#channel</span> ". Now, with this log message, you stated that someone PMed your bot while (if you just read the log message), by IRC protocol, it was a message to the channel (notice the # in there). I pointed this out by simply saying “it is a message sent to channel, as defined by the IRC protocol”.</p>
<p>Apparently, you cannot distinguish facts with an attempt to so-said rage.</p>
<p>As for iCyrus, he stated that warez are allowed on an IRC channel, because “server and channel rules don’t state that warez are illegal to distribute on here, and the law doesn’t apply because the server and channel rules don’t say anything about it”. I then responded that was wrong, noted that the UK law (did an IP whois, servers located in the UK) states the distribution of warez are illegal and that, since the IRC servers are hosted in the UK, should be applied to the server itself and the underlying IRC server and channels. He then just kept flaming how wrong I was, without giving any real argument as to why I would be wrong, randomly trolling to have the last word, making up more wrong statements along the way.</p>
<p>This ended, not by how you said it, but when a mod decided to ban &amp; kick both me and iCyrus. iCyrus for being a troll and wrong, me because - I admit - at one point at the end, I did make use of the word “fuck” in the context of “fuck you” and “fuck it”. Which, theoretically, is probably against the rules. The one that kicked us back then even PMed me to state he did not ban/kick me for choosing sides or for anything personal, but to calm the situation down.</p>
<p>As for the last paragraph, I think any somewhat intelligent individual notices your need to use invalid excuses like “being human”, “it’s written in Java, so hackable” and the need to boost MitB members’ self-esteem by calling them very skilled programmers, just to get ‘on their good side’, as some might say.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no doubt some individuals on here are skilled programmers, but that also goes for any programming-related community. On the other hand, I also most certainly do not doubt there are people on here with 0 programming experience.</p>
<p>You’re a drama queen, Potential. Did you forget you were the one that told me to put this on here?<br>
I post IRC logs, and you say I “misquote you”. On the other hand, you posted an edited screenshot of an IRC log on RSBuddy. And it was still you that got flamed for not knowing what you’re talking about.</p>

<p>Before continuing to the point, please read his post at RSBuddy, which I’ll quote here.</p>
<blockquote>inb4 flaming starts: I'm not flaming the mods and admins, please continue reading.
<p>So there’s this kid, a scripter here on RSBuddy that goes by the nickname Potential.<br>
I was on Andy’s (from Andy’s FDK) IRC channel <span class="hashtag">#AndyFrosts</span> and he was on there as well. We didn’t know each other yet, so nothing was wrong. After a while, he was boasting about “the new fighter he’s going to release, v2” and how it “was way better than any other fighter out there”. He also kept saying this stuff while other scripters that had fighters were in the channel.</p>
<p>But I kept quiet, let the kid boast, didn’t say anything about it. But then he made the completely invalid statement that his script is ‘unhackable’. Or, to be more exact, that it is impossible to retrieve data sent between his server and the script. I noted that it’s perfectly possible to do that, and I even gave him a simple theory about how to do it.</p>
<p>At this point, he started getting extremely cocky. Telling me to stop ‘inventing theories’ because “it’s impossible”, and things like that. I continued trying to explain to him the details of my theories and how it is possible. No positive result, he just couldn’t stand being wrong.</p>
<p>So he just kept going on and on and on and on and he told me to post my theories on MitB (moparisthebest) forums, so that they could “laugh their ass off at my theories”. So I did. This is the link: ‘Unhackable’ script? Theory testing.</p>
<p>The day after, Potential came back on the IRC channel, read the MitB thread, responded that all theories (even the ones posted by MitB admins) are invalid. He posted some code in the channel later on, I commented on it being theoretically incorrect, he then banned me from Andy’s IRC channel:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first, I did not ‘boast about my fighter’, people were asking me simple questions, and I was answering, afterall everybody is happy about their little babies growing up, and the fact is that the only RSBuddy script writer that comes to the strictfp network, and go to the channel that this incident occurred is biking, in which he logged onto the channel later on, and can be seen at the logs Seb_^ provided.</p>
<p>At first, people asked me if it’s possible to submit a path that leads into the wilderness, and waiting for them and killing them, in which I responded, I’ll be testing the path myself, making such operation impossible, later on people asked me if they could dump the whole paths from the web side, as in dump them from the php folder, in which I responded it’s close to impossible!</p>
<p>Later Seb_^ came around bragging about how he could hack the system, in which I responded, ‘it is possible, but I doubt YOU will be able to do it’. and he kept bragging about how he could do it, in which I thought if I thought he was another powerbot average script-writer, and usually script-writers listen to me  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> so I though if I told him it’s not possible, he would shut up, but instead he kept talking, in which I though I’ll give him something to do so he can get off my back, at first I told him to crack RSBuddy system, as the sequence is the same, and he said, it’s not, I told him it is, and he found out it is, and said, “well it is but the datatype isn’t the same”, and then I linked him here, attempting to let him shut up, and it did work!</p>
<p>The next day, he came, and start bragging about it, I told him what-ever, but you must not misquote me!</p>
<p>Andy then, asked him how I could stop the script from the loop() method, I told him to return -1, in which if I recall correctly, this sequence have been used since speljohan_ wrote RSBot (please verify this), was used when Qauters took over, and still used today, in which other platforms have imitated the sequence (KBot, RSBuddy, Quirlion), Seb_^ came raging at me, claiming I should return 0, in which that any other number is an error number, and that’s how he should have done it, afterwards I linked him to the RSBuddy documentary to see that he is infact incorrect, and he linked me to a tutorial at oracle, in which I believed that I shouldn’t have this conversation again, and kicked him out of the channel.</p>
<p>He went on to complain at RSBuddy main site, in which someone would think that he is unfamiliar with how the IRC work, but a few days after, I was testing a markov-chain bot in the channel, in which Speed started breaking it by linking every word to the word penis! I asked Andy if has send a private message to the bot, and he responded negatively, one would only guess who came popping out out of no-where, yes, it’s Seb_^! he came raging at me and telling me how there are only one protocol that IRC uses, and I should use it, and started linking me to several documentary about the protocol, I didn’t say anything as I don’t want to get onto another fight, but simply commented that such operations as version asking, I do not need to simply test if markov-chain work or not! kind of odd that someone who doesn’t know about how networks work, yet knows very well how the protocol does!</p>
<p>A few days after (yesterday to be precise), he came at me, intending to start a fight, in which Aion told me not to go there, and I kept my responses as simple as possible, he yet came at another member, iCyrus, telling him how bad iCyrus is and how good he is, in which he got into a fighter with further members of the channel, and responded to every small troll message with a long speech like a 13 years old kid would do, but with better grammar, in which a member responded, “Go out, have a normal conversation with someone, and then come back here. as clearly you can’t handle it!” in which I though, that’s truly the best possible answer, to someone with so little self-belief!</p>
<p>The only time I said it was unhackable was the time when I was trying to get him to stop highlighting me and leave me to my business, the script is infact, very much hackable, every system is, if you feel that you would want to hack it, go ahead, but it’ll not be much of a challenge to any of you, as after-all, most of you are very skilled, in my defense, I don’t think the average powerbot member or script-writer would be able to do it, even some developers there would suffer, but it is after all, a system that is wrote in Java, and it is hackable, I am extremely sorry for any headache that my saga came out with, I hope everyone accept my sincere apology, after-all, we are only human!</p>

<p>There’s is also a first part where I get to know him, he asks me for help with his PHP repository, I tell him I might help, etc.<br>
But that’s not really important to when it went wrong. Back then, he was asking me for help, the codepad I just linked is what happened afterwards.</p>

<p>Potential should know that calling  something unhackable just make it a challenge. (Nobody here would offer a second on his script if he just had been modest about his script)</p>
<p>My theory on how to do it are pretty simple but could have some potential. Just record the scripts actions, where/what/when it clicks. (Assume it do the actions through the client, if not record what you character do).<br>
You have the Rsbuddy jar so it should be no problem for anyone with some knowledge to do it.</p>
<p>EDIT: I don’t really think my idea would work, so don’t flame me and burn me on the fire.</p>

Even if it’s using a PKI, the client will have the public key and, with it, the ability to decrypt anything the server encrypted. Will it take time to do this? Yes. Is it worth the hacker’s time? Maybe. Is there anyway a client side program can be made completely secure? Not that I know of.</p>
