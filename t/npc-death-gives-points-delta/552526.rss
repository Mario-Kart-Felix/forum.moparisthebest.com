    <description>Wondering if there is an easier way to give points when an NPC dies.


My current code is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;if (npcs[i].npcType == 123) {
temp.AfterLifeCP += 42;
}&lt;/blockquote&gt;


It gives 42 points because the NPC&#39;s level is 42. 

I have to implement this code with [u]every[/u] NPC to give it the points upon death but that will take a long time to do as there are over 800+ NPC&#39;s.


Is there any way to make it so when someone kills a NPC a code determins what level the NPC is and gives it the level amount worth points?</description>

              <p>Possible? Yes.<br>
However, it being done will ultimately depend on how you would like to do it.</p>
<p>The “best” way I could think of doing it is this:</p>
<p>Have a file that contains some NPC definitions. Most deltas do have this, but I personally am not aware of what information it holds.<br>
At minimal, this file needs to contain the NPC’s combat level, and NPC id. Anything else would just be a bonus (To be used in other parts of the server).<br>
Now, load said file at the start of the server, and make all it’s data save into an array or similar (ArrayList, List, HashMap, whatever).</p>
<p>Once a player kills an NPC, get that npcs information from the file (Typically done by creating a method that would loop the definitions until it found one with the right ID - Also dependent on what object you set the definitions as).<br>
If the information isn’t null, add the NPC level to the player’s AfterLifeCP variable.</p>
