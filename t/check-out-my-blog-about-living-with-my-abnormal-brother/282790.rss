    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/check-out-my-blog-about-living-with-my-abnormal-brother/282790</link>
    <description>I live with a brother who has an extremely rare chromosome abnormality. I just started a blog that I will update every day about living with him. It would be greatly appreciated if the members of MITB would follow it and help me out. Thank you, and the link is in my signature.



UPDATE: Why, my good friend Cooper has pointed out my stupidity! I must fix it right now.
/sarcasm

[quote=&quot;cooper&quot;]According to Andrew, &quot;my mother had him at a late age - causing him to be born from an old egg that had spoiled over the years.&quot;[/quote]

Well son, you see - women have EGGS, and when your daddy ejaculates inside your mommy, his sperm swims through her vagina and attaches to the egg. As a women gets older, so does her eggs! Magnificent!
As her eggs get older they are more prone to growing problems such as the abnormality my brother was born with.

Next time if your going to correct me at least have passed 9th grade or sex ed.







UPDATE: New post. Same dosage of medications but different mood today.

someone, from this forum, posted it there.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 08, 2009, 11:34:25 am[/size][hr][quote author=Lothy link=topic=373689.msg2818867#msg2818867 date=1244458867]

Stephen was only a little pain in my ass today. He is starting to be exceptionally annoying, and all day has been repeating the same phrases. To a person first meeting Stephen, it may seem funny. After hearing the same thing for 24 hours straight, you want to tie him to the wall and kick the shit out of him.
[/quote]
Very distasteful.
[/quote]
so? i love how people here are all like &#39;omg i am so morally correct,&#39; pretty sure if you were in his position you would feel the same[/quote]
Haha thanks man. Yeah, most people don&#39;t understand. I didn&#39;t expect everyone to.


Update: Because of all the flaming I am recieving, I edited my first post as I was very pissed at him, and explained his abnormality and symptoms.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Javacisnotrecognized, post:62, topic:282790”]I think it’d be worthwhile to continue the blog, however I think you should make it something a bit more interesting than ‘My brother annoyed me  much today’. I think it would be nice if you could perform and detail the results of a few experiments on him. For example, if you showed him this image, <a href="http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/802/cog2.png" rel="nofollow noopener">http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/802/cog2.png</a> , how quickly would he notice the square that doesn’t fit in? This kind of thing. It’s kind of hard to find information about these people, because their caretakers usually take the stance that most people here have taken - that it’s something that should be kept private. But I’m really interested in trying to understand how this guy thinks.</p>
<p>However, you’re doing something that is going to seem uncomfortable to many people. To make it go most smoothly, I suggest you try to remain as ‘perfect’ as possible. For example, you’ve already gotten picked on for something as trivial as a spelling mistake. Alot of people are going to become self appointed “Internet police” around you, (Some will probably send you hate messages and threats), so it’s advisable to remove any information that could be used to personally identify you. Of course, make no hesitation on banning/ignoring these people.</p>
<p>Then again, you’ve probably figured all this out already. So in summary, please keep it updated, I’ll read  :)[/quote]</p>
<p>That actually isn’t a bad idea</p>

Just stating a point.<br>
You think everyone in my family loves him all the time?<br>
No. It doesn’t work like that. It’s my mom’s decision to put him in a group home, not mine.</p>

Publicly sharing the information across the internet is, in my opinion, shameful and exploitation. I’m eager to know what your ulterior motives are because I cannot see any motivation to do this other than for sympathy or attention.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’d be more understanding if you didn’t talk about wanting to beat the shit out of your disabled brother.</p>

What? You said you will post how it happened, but you didn’t, so I quoted you from your blog. Of course I know how a baby is born, and I took sex ed many years ago.</p>

<p>It’s a metaphor. As a woman ages, her oocytes age with her, and after age 40, it is generally not recommended to conceive because the chances of a genetic disorder are higher because of the egg aging.</p>

<p>Yes, his parents should be blamed for it, because it is their fault. Any competent ob/gyn would recommend against it due to her age, and any competent parent would heed that advice.</p>

<p>Nowhere on that site do I see him saying “LOAlaoloLoLolo My BRo R Fukin Dum Lol!” He is using the internet as a expressive medium to help him cope with the stress his brother creates. He talks about how annoying his brother is so he can let some of the emotion out. I don’t see anything wrong with that.</p>

<p>Finally someone else who knows their shit</p>
<p>A women is born with eggs that some will sit with her throughout her for her entire life- she doesn’t make new eggs.<br>
This is why Men rarely ever contribute to the chromosome abnormality - our sperm is always renewed.</p>

<p>If you lived with him you would understand, and I have big anger problems.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, we’ve realised that you have big anger problems as we here at this forum have already felt the full force of it.</p>
<p>Yes, now back to ‘constructive criticism’. I don’t like it how you’re so mad at your brother who has unfortunately got a rare disease which is not his fault and not what he wanted but that’s for you to decide and not me because I don’t know how it feels to be someone in your position.</p>
