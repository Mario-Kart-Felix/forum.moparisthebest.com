Lyrics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Deepest red born winter day
For no one so dark as night
As the light - faded away
Bring forth the way of life

Where whispers sound like hopeless screams
When you crossed the line of life
Where silence freeze into endless pain
When you stopped to be

I remember the silence night
As you crushed, as you crushed away
Why did you leave?
Why did you leave my life?

Death interrupt what is begun
Take the angel back to the sky
Empty thoughts - hopeless time
Fallen dreams sopped me now

Where whispers sound like hopeless screams
When you crossed the line of life
Where silence freeze into endless pain
When you stopped to be

I remember the silence night
As you crushed, as you crushed away
Why did you leave?
Why did you leave my life?
For one moment in life
Feel the emptiness in my soul
In my breath
In my thought
I tell you why&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I know you will probally HATE This, give it a chance, i think most of it is pretty awsome  ;)</description>
