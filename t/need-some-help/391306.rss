    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-help/391306</link>
    <description>well im making a dungeoneering skill its going pretty good but how would i make it so you can buy items with the tokens the monsters drop? would i use prices.text? ive tried a few things and cant get it. Help would be nice  :)

Also how would i make it so when you craft runes you also get 1 token? same question but with a diffrent way of obtaining you would get like example: 23 nats and 1 token instead of just 23 nats. Thx  :D</description>
