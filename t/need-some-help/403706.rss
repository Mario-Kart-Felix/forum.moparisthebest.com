    <title>Need some help :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-help/403706</link>
    <description>Ok, I have been waiting for someone to get on for 2 days now. He is helping with my server and he said that we can use his source. I have been waiting for this source for 2 days now and he hasn&#39;t been on. He is the one out of us 2 that is experienced in the forum junk. And he knows what to buy for the server and what not to. So, I am looking for someone to talk to me on msn right now and possibly teach me some things cause I am really bored. I need to know what is the best forum to use, what all should I buy to have a successful server, and what not to do that will make my server a fail. I also need to know a good source to use, what base should I use, and if you have an msn, please tell me it. If any of you know a good free forum to use and a cheap domain I can get please tell me, and if you are experienced in making a forum please try to teach me the basics of it. Thanks alot everyone, please feel free to comment even if it isn&#39;t really helping. If you are going to help PLEASE leave your msn.</description>

<p>It wasn’t really a troll, he was a great coder, good helper… Probably just can’t get on atm. Probably will use SMF. I have No-IP. I’m interested in PI atm, need to know a good PI source (Should have included that). What is the game?</p>
