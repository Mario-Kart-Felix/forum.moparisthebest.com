    <description>Okay, My name is Ducky!
Msn : Jensen_105@hotmail.com
Skype : Kaz0r12

The problem is, I did port forward, I got port forward from uTorrent etc. I got a 317 Source, a Webclient etc. But when people try to join it says ; &quot;Error connecting to server&quot; Runelocus status checker says the server is Online but none can get on? Wtf.. I did everything wrong. None know what to do :/ Pissing me off serius. All I want is that it&#39;s Online. But nothing helps.
Can anyone try help me, maybe some got a idé why its says ;&quot;Error connecting to server&quot; I use Windows 7, 64x bit.</description>
