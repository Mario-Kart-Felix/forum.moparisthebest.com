<p>You have to add the item id’s to the monster that is being attacked. Therefore adding ‘NPCDROPS’ to the NPC which are located in NPCDROPS.TSM I believe the extension is called.</p>
<p>Assuming it was a PVP source; you have to add the rest of the Teleports to it. You are going to want to add the cords for them which is located in Config.Java.[/quote]</p>
