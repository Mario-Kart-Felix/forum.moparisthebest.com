    <title>Need some help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-help/346823</link>
    <description>Well I posted this on rune server and of course, days later and no one has offered help, so I thought I&#39;d try it here. Basically I just recently bought a new laptop, ever since the change however a problem has come about. Its perfectly fine when I play other servers but when I play on a client runnning a server off my computer, and I click anywhere to walk my client instantly shuts out with some java runetime error. Heres a little part of the error as the whole thing is rather long to post lol.

#
# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
#
# EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x000000006d807846, pid=5276, tid=2344
#
# JRE version: 7.0-b86
# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (17.0-b10 mixed mode windows-amd64 compressed oops)
# Problematic frame:
# V [jvm.dll+0x57846]
#
# If you would like to submit a bug report, please visit:
# http://java.sun.com/webapps/bugreport/crash.jsp
#

Now i feel as if the problem has an easy fix but since i&#39;ve done everything i can think of i thought i&#39;d ask other people. sorry if the fix is easy or something if it is just know i&#39;m starting out with this whole thing, put yourself in my shoes. thanks in advance for any help.</description>

              <p>Ok, um, if I change my paths to anything other then what they are, it now says java is not recognized as internal or external command.</p>
<p>Also, my java is jre7 and jdk1.7.0 so if your paths are jre6 currently, could it be that the new java update is conflicting with windows7? I’m just throwing ideas out there as I also tried to run one on my old laptop and the same error occurs, second I walk anywhere in the map I disconnect and client closes out. I can teleport, and do other functions just not walk…</p>
<p>Also, moparscape 4 webclient works fine, but its just beyond laggy so I thought i’d try to fix my problem. And yes, this happens with every server, every client. Just giving all the details <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>edit - also guys, thanks for the replys, they’re all helpful</p>
