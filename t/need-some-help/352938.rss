    <description>Some what new to this, but I know my way around. I was wondering if anyone could let me know how to allow the server to be with the highscores? I haven&#39;t set them up yet, I&#39;ve just edited the files so its the servers name and all that good stuff. I just don&#39;t know if the IP should be the servers, or mine?

Its on a VPS, so I have no clue. I&#39;m some what stumped, so if anyone would like to help, either PM or reply on here. 

Thank you.</description>
