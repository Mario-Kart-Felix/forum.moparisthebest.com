              <p>Well first off is to get a good virus protector. You can either buy it legitly, or you can download a cracked version [Which is illegal, but so many people do it].</p>
<p>Second if that doesn’t work you can keep trying to get rid of it with other programs but the best answer if you really have a lot of adware is to just reformat your computer. Which means wiping the hard drive and starting again [By re-installing windows]. You should of course back up all your important documents onto a memory stick or some blank disks so you don’t lose your data for ever.</p>
<p>Third answer is to wait for someone else to answer with a different answer to what i wrote.</p>
