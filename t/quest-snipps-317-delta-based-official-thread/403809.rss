[font=arial][size=10pt]Hello everyone. Today, I&#39;m going to be starting a thing called Quest Snipps. Quest Snipps. are highly coded quests with depth dialogue, requirements, interfaces, and more. I decided to start Quest Snipps. after seeing that they would be very useful to 317 coders looking to add some of RuneScape&#39;s good memories from 2006-2008. The first thing that came to mind were the 13 original quests. Varying from the easy as cake quest, Cook&#39;s Assistant to the long and difficult, Dragon Slayer. Ofcourse there will be other custom quests too. Alot of them. I hope these will be used often in the future developement of 317 RuneScape Private Servers.[/size][/font]

[font=courier][size=12pt][b]How does it work?[/b][/size][/font]
[font=arial][size=10pt]I will code the quest on my test server. (Un-Released) Then I will go to www.pastebin.com, post the steps for there how to get that quest on your server 100%. There will be a list of my the quests and links on this thread here. After you add the quest to your server you come back here, comment, and say thanks if you want to. Simple enough, don&#39;t you guys think so? I just want everyone to have the full 100% quests feature on their server.  [/size][/font]
