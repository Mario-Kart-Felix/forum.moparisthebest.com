    <title>Missing some sprites?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/missing-some-sprites/218411</link>
    <description>Well I am editting a wL client and have gotten most of the coding done, so I wanted to make it look a little better. But when I went into the sprites folder, I see everything except the button to click to get on, and the small menu that is in the center?

Does anyone know why they aren&#39;t there? Or how I can get them?</description>
