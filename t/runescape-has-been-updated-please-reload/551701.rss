    <title>Runescape has been Updated - Please Reload</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-has-been-updated-please-reload/551701</link>
    <description>Hi, I originally posted this in client help but I&#39;m guessing this is more server related as all of the clients I have tried are now giving me this error. They didn&#39;t used to, and I&#39;m not sure what I changed to do this. Actually I reset my router to try and figure out port forwarding (which I can&#39;t btw) and then this error started occuring... Here are the command prompts when I run the server and client:

Server:

&amp; Client Side:

This happens whether I run the server and client on the ip shown or 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0. No matter what, now I am getting &quot;Runescape has been updated....&quot;</description>
