[b]Hello,Mopar. I want to thank each and every one of you who have clicked on this thread. I know that most of you will click away as soon as you see what source I am using, and honestly, I think that would be a mistake. I am using a 317 Allstar base. You are probably laughing, and asking, &quot;Why the hell would he do that? Allstar is dead.&quot; Well, you&#39;re not wrong... but you&#39;re not right, either. It isn&#39;t completely dead. I know of a lot of people that would love to play a greatly coded Allstar. Most of the time, Allstar owners shut their server down because it&#39;s dead in 2 days. And that is where I am going to make a difference in this community. I am going to spend all of my free time coding this server, because I know that it can be turned into something great. Yes, it will take a very long time to make any Allstar great, or any server for that matter, but it can happen. Nobody likes to give the time and effort. If someone put as much time and effort into coding an Allstar as much as they do criticizing it, they could make one great. Let&#39;s bring Allstar back![/b]
