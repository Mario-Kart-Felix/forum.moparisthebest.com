    <description>First of all Moparscape is [shadow=red,left]AMAZING[/shadow]!! For like the last couple of days i have been playing a server named &quot;ultimascape&quot; which is fun, and i have decided to make one. I only know the basic things about moparscape like to add items and nothing that is that complex.. and i have been trying to find some kind of java reader or something to like read those .class and .java files.. I also need a coder of course and i need him or her to show me some basics on java writing and so on.. I also am very dedicated to any games i play and im sure if i got some good stuff we&#39;ll have a good server :D

 :I also have msn please talk to me freely it&#39;s [glow=red,2,300]Roxycutieboy@aim.com[/glow]

Thank you so much!!
