    <title>Connections site to server not working?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connections-site-to-server-not-working/401866</link>
    <description>Ok, so I was coding this site, and I added highscores and auto donation. I followed tutorials made by other people to set them up. So, I set them up, and they don&#39;t work. The Highscores doesn&#39;t show the players and the auto donations doesn&#39;t give the players their shit. I know it&#39;s a connection problem, but I don&#39;t know how to fix it... If this is any help, theres a vote4points system that&#39;s working!</description>
