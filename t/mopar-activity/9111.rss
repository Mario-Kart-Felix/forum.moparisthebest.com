<p>Not “liking” private servers isn’t the issue. The issue is the amount of spam and general crap that is either posted or misposted, that has truly nothing to do with what I thought the foundations of this site were about.</p>

Somehow, the hundreds of 1-5 posters screwing up all of the other forums make this seem rather pointless.

              <p>Although the idea of “community” is romantic, it’s not really sustainable if your main attraction is targeted at mostly immature people.<br>
I really do not care if I am stereotyping like this, I am right. Your private server forums generally attract hundreds of 1-5 posters, and this is very clearly evident by the amount of crap that is posted non-stop. It is not a “select” few doing this.</p>
<p>As for your hand in hand comment, which I needed help decyphering, I entirely disagree.<br>
Cheating on live, a fight against jagex and their updates, finding clever ways to go around the things that people try to stop you doing.<br>
Server development, the creation of content, a “fun” thing to do.<br>
They are really not related, and as you can very evidently see, the combination of both on a single site is not getting a positive outcome.</p>
<p>I will restate myself, as you seemed to have ignored me. I am not against the idea of a private server community, I just feel &amp; know that both will be better off if you move private server forums to to their own at <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com</a>, and keep the live cheating forums here at <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com</a>. You can always cross-link between each other.</p>
<p>I must add, that this situation could be controlled through some hard work by admins and moderators, but as this is not happening on a grand enough scale, seperation is the next best thing to do.</p>

When I said "traditional methods of cheating" it was entirely my intention to include SCAR'ers, Client Hackers, or otherwise that is used to cheat on the live version of the game.
<p>Believe me, I respect people who SCAR, it is simply another means to achieve a similar objective.</p>
<p>I am not arguing the fact that making private servers is “fun” or a “hobby”. I am arguing that this particular “hobby” has turned  this particular forum to shit, and I am begging mopar to move it to another site, seperating the two “hobbies”, and the two levels of maturity that seem to be associated with each.</p>
