    <title>Decrease memory usage of multiple clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decrease-memory-usage-of-multiple-clients/448341</link>
    <description>Hey, so I developed a pretty simple client that downloads the runescape loader, and loads multiple instances of the Rs2Applet class into a JTabbedPane.  I do some basic manipulation of the Canvas&#39;s within the Applets, but my main problem is that each additional tab takes 300mb+ of memory, and significantly slows down the others.  Running 2 clients eventually ends up using over a gb of memory, and both are veeeery slow.  I can&#39;t run more than 3 clients simultaneously without them lagging so bad they lobby.

I&#39;ve looked into it, and correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I believe the problem stems from the fact that each instance of Rs2Applet unpacked its own version of the encrypted gamepack and reloads the runescape classes into the JVM.

I am a very good programmer, but I&#39;m completely new to BCEL and ASM.  Could someone please point me to some resources that could help me with THIS specific problem?  I&#39;ve done a lot of research and all I&#39;ve been able to find is tutorials for creating single clients, and none of them seem to load the client in any better way than I do.

*edit: just to clarify, I am not interested in making an intelligent BOT.  This program is merely a swiftkit-type client, with a few &quot;illegal&quot; additions (autotyper, autoclicker, multilog feature).  I have not had to dive into bytecode manipulation for any of this, but I believe I might have to in order to fix this issue.  If I&#39;m wrong in that belief, PLEASE share</description>

              <p>so in case anyone else wants the answer here it is:</p>
<p>I ran jvisualvm (comes free with JDK) and had it monitor my client.  I had tried JProfiler earlier (the free trial) and apparently it must suck because it gave completely different results, and did not help me successfully shut off rendering.  However, using jvisualvm I was quickly able to find the opengl (directx on windows probly) calls that were hogging the CPU.  I managed to trace the majority of these calls back to a function with over 6000 lines of bytecode, and the signature: ([L**;IIIIIIIIZI)V, where ** is some obfuscated class name that doesnt really matter.  It turns out there are only 2 functions with this signature in the entire runescape jar, and the other one is much much smaller.  Insert a “hook” (I’m new to hacking idk the terminology) to the beginning of this function that just exits when you disable rendering, and you will cut your CPU usage down by a factor of 2!</p>
<p>Looking a little further, there were still calls to OpenGL.swapBuffers that were hogging a lot of the CPU time.  I traced these calls back to 1 function, but just for the sake of redundancy, I ended up inserting my “hook” into every function with any OpenGL code.  Here is the code I’m using to do this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public void insertGraphicsHooks(ClassGen cg)
	{
		if(cg.getClassName().contains("jaggl") || cg.getClassName().contains("jagdx") || cg.getClassName().contains("jagtheora"))
			return;
		ConstantPoolGen cpg = cg.getConstantPool();
		for(Method m: cg.getMethods())
		{
			MethodGen mg = new MethodGen(m, cg.getClassName(), cpg);
			if(mg.getInstructionList() == null)
				continue;
			Iterator iter = mg.getInstructionList().iterator();
			while(iter.hasNext())
			{
				InstructionHandle handle = (InstructionHandle)iter.next();
				if(handle.getInstruction() instanceof InvokeInstruction)
				{
					InvokeInstruction inst = (InvokeInstruction)handle.getInstruction();
					if(inst.getLoadClassType(cpg).getSignature().contains("jaggl") ||
							inst.getLoadClassType(cpg).getSignature().contains("jagdx") ||
							inst.getLoadClassType(cpg).getSignature().contains("jagtheora"))
					{
						insertHook(cg,cpg,mg);
						break;
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}</code></pre>
<p>This, along with the higher level hook successfully cut the CPU usage down by about 80%.  The only remaining resource hog is a call to InputStream.read, which is coming from the threads receiving input from the runescape server.  Although you can’t simply cut this call out, you might be able to slow it down to reduce the load even more…</p>

I actually did make a little progess by using a memory analyzing program to identify where CPU was spending most of its time.  I managed to cut out about 50% of the cpu load by disabling a high level function in the client class.  That remaining 50% has keyboard events integrated somewhere into it though, so its not nearly as simple (my autotyper stops working when I disable it).</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Assuming the modern safe-mode rendering is essentially the same as the old client’s software rendering, the Graphics.drawImage() call uses an Image produced (I believe using ImageProducer) from a raster of pixels which is written to when rendering the scene. This rendering phase is where all the projection math is done, along with the scanline-conversion and what not. Assuming you find the raster (it was an int[] in the older clients), you should be able to trace that to find the code that uses it. If you can disable the entire rendering process, you’ll find the client runs much faster.</p>

<p>I’m not surprised it didn’t work, I’m just telling you guys what I have tried.  I’ve been completely unable to trace the obfuscated code back from the Graphics.drawImage call to the actual processing.  So if either of you have any information that can help me narrow down where the CPU-intensive code is, that would be great.</p>

              <p>The client is heavy with global state and attempting to use a single class loader will fail pretty quickly… you’ll be unintentionally sharing state between two instances of the client, which (logically) is a <span class="bbcode-i">bad idea</span>. Consider a simple dummy case where some rendering mechanism requires configuration of some static fields</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">class Client {
  ...
  Scene scene;
  Surface surface;
  ...
  void init() {
    ...
    Renderer.configure(scene, surface.raster());
    ...
  }
  ...
  void render() {
    ...
    Renderer.render();
    ...
  }
}</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Client client_a = createClient(...);
client_a.init();
...
Client client_b = createClient(...);
client_b.init();
...
client_a.render(); /* rendering using client_b's scene and surface! */</code></pre>
<p>You must keep the game clients independent and unaware of one another. Experiment with multi-VM approaches and see how that works for you. (added bonus: attaching to browser applet VMs with a debugging agent, work without an explicit loader)</p>
<p>If you’re interested in truly decreasing memory usage of the client, there’s not much you can really do that won’t require at least <span class="bbcode-i">modest</span> re-engineering of the game code. I haven’t looked at client’s more than about 2 or 3 years old now so my advice may be dated, so hopefully someone with more up-to-date advice may provide some assistance here.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hey, so I developed a pretty simple client that downloads the runescape loader, and loads multiple instances of the Rs2Applet class into a JTabbedPane.  I do some basic manipulation of the Canvas’s within the Applets, but my main problem is that each additional tab takes 300mb+ of memory, and significantly slows down the others.  Running 2 clients eventually ends up using over a gb of memory, and both are veeeery slow.  I can’t run more than 3 clients simultaneously without them lagging so bad they lobby.</p>
<p>I’ve looked into it, and correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe the problem stems from the fact that each instance of Rs2Applet unpacked its own version of the encrypted gamepack and reloads the runescape classes into the JVM.</p>
<p>I am a very good programmer, but I’m completely new to BCEL and ASM.  Could someone please point me to some resources that could help me with THIS specific problem?  I’ve done a lot of research and all I’ve been able to find is tutorials for creating single clients, and none of them seem to load the client in any better way than I do.</p>
<p>*edit: just to clarify, I am not interested in making an intelligent BOT.  This program is merely a swiftkit-type client, with a few “illegal” additions (autotyper, autoclicker, multilog feature).  I have not had to dive into bytecode manipulation for any of this, but I believe I might have to in order to fix this issue.  If I’m wrong in that belief, PLEASE share</p>
