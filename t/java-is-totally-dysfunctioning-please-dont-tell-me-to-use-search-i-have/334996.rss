    <description>I have spent over three hours trying to start my own rsc server to no avail because every time i tried to log in it would say &quot;unable to connect&quot;. I have used the search button continuously and have followed the steps to putting my i.p. address in the server and system files but I was not able to compile them. I thought the the only thing I needed to do was install jdk (the path was set to jre not jdk) and set it as the path, so I followed the stickied thread that told me to download java se development and now it&#39;s even worse than the message that says &quot;unable to connect&quot; because the rsc client doesn&#39;t even start up. Even worse, I can&#39;t get into the rscemulation client or virtually any rsc client EVEN WHEN I CHANGHE THE PATH BACK TO MY ORIGINAL jre! What can i do?

This was the message I got when trying to compile before java COMPLETELY broke down on me:

              <p>Ok great, thanks. I’m back to opening my client but I still can’t connect to server. For some bizarre reason every last item in my jdk folder in the java folder has vanished. When I try to use .exe to extract it again it leaves an empty folder. Should I reinstall the .exe application??</p>
