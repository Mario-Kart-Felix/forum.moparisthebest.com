    <title>Low Poly Hatchet For Modelling Class</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/low-poly-hatchet-for-modelling-class/422828</link>
    <description>Hey guys, some of you may be wondering why I am only posting low poly and/or very simply models lately, the reason why is that I am working on some big projects (models) at the time, and I could show you some progress and the beginning as a WIP topic, but I&#39;d rather spend all my time on them to show you how much I really have in myself as a modeller.

On-Topic here, We needed to make a low-poly weapon with the maximum amount of 73triangles (yes triangles, we&#39;re working with the Cry(Tek)Engine at school, it reads triangles easier then verticles or what-so-ever that&#39;s what they&#39;ve told us.)

So here is a render :

And for the ones who like a wireframe : (also polycount in it)
[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/34hdh4z.png[/img]

Sorry for the delay on the big models that I am making at the moment, but I am currently also going through some private madness with my girlfriend, so yeah.

Anyways, tell me what you think.</description>

This is like 2 seconds of modeling… I don’t care if it was supposed to be a low poly model. The handle looks like you randomly loop cut a square and moved the loops around on the X axis. The hatchet head is way too under detailed in comparison to the handle and you didn’t even take the time to combine the edges on the blade of it…<br>

I can take feedback, but the way you are telling me what I did wrong, and how I messed up badly, is making me think that you have a lot of anger deep inside of you that you are keeping inside of you. You should go see a psych or something.<br>
Not wanting to start an argue with this, but don’t you think, that if you gave me feedback in a positive way, rather in a normal base of grammar, and not with your herpy derpy angry mode blasting on me like your frikkin’ shoop da whoop or what not, that you would point me on my faults and on how to improve, that it wouldn’t get you more respect from users on MoparScape?<br>
Just to say, I am currently disrespecting you , just by how you comment on my topic.<br>

[/quote]Didn’t give you feedback? I’m guessing you didn’t get passed the second sentence before you came and wrote an essay on why I’m a douche bag. Here let me fix it for you so that you’ll take the criticism: I like how you got two squares and loop cut them, and scaled a little, good job, you’re the best low poly modeler ever.</p>
<p>Does the crytek engine support textures? Because a texture would maybe get your point across as to what’s going on with this model.[/quote]Big thanks on the criticism ! , I still feel like to apologize to you, sir.<br>
I’ve had a bad evening that day and for some reason I raged it all over you, my honest apologies for that.<br>
I understand what you’re saying, and will give the model a twist when I get time to do so.<br>
For the crytek engine’s  texture support, for that what I know about it it does have texture support, but it doesn’t support subdivisions in 3d objects if I am right</p>

I agree with rip4d. Maybe 8 more polys in rip4d’s blade and 12 more in the handle and you have a nice axe. Probably could get rid of two of those loop cuts int ACF’s and still have the same effect with the handle.</p>

<p>It’s absolutely dreadful. I can’t post a picture right now, but I’ll try to explain what it looks like. The lighting is hideous. Even a blind man could see each individual shape. Moving them together (overlapping) doesn’t do a thing.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Assassins Creed Fan, post:1, topic:422828”]Hey guys, some of you may be wondering why I am only posting low poly and/or very simply models lately, the reason why is that I am working on some big projects (models) at the time, and I could show you some progress and the beginning as a WIP topic, but I’d rather spend all my time on them to show you how much I really have in myself as a modeller.</p>
<p>On-Topic here, We needed to make a low-poly weapon with the maximum amount of 73triangles (yes triangles, we’re working with the Cry(Tek)Engine at school, it reads triangles easier then verticles or what-so-ever that’s what they’ve told us.)</p>
<p>So here is a render :<br>
<img src="http://i44.tinypic.com/29kqot3.png" alt width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>And for the ones who like a wireframe : (also polycount in it)<br>
<img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/34hdh4z.png" alt width="679" height="408"></p>
<p>Sorry for the delay on the big models that I am making at the moment, but I am currently also going through some private madness with my girlfriend, so yeah.</p>
<p>Anyways, tell me what you think.[/quote]<br>
so show us your good stuff, not this junk  ;D</p>

Bretty big mouth for just being on a Modelling Board, don’t you think?<br>
I can take feedback, but the way you are telling me what I did wrong, and how I messed up badly, is making me think that you have a lot of anger deep inside of you that you are keeping inside of you. You should go see a psych or something.<br>
Not wanting to start an argue with this, but don’t you think, that if you gave me feedback in a positive way, rather in a normal base of grammar, and not with your herpy derpy angry mode blasting on me like your frikkin’ shoop da whoop or what not, that you would point me on my faults and on how to improve, that it wouldn’t get you more respect from users on MoparScape?<br>
Just to say, I am currently disrespecting you , just by how you comment on my topic.<br>
Just like I said, I can take feedback, but this isn’t feedback at all buddy.<br>

              <p>[quote=“Java Is My Bitch, post:5, topic:422828”]This is like 2 seconds of modeling… I don’t care if it was supposed to be a low poly model. The handle looks like you randomly loop cut a square and moved the loops around on the X axis. The hatchet head is way too under detailed in comparison to the handle and you didn’t even take the time to combine the edges on the blade of it…[/quote]Bretty big mouth for just being on a Modelling Board, don’t you think?<br>
I can take feedback, but the way you are telling me what I did wrong, and how I messed up badly, is making me think that you have a lot of anger deep inside of you that you are keeping inside of you. You should go see a psych or something.<br>
Not wanting to start an argue with this, but don’t you think, that if you gave me feedback in a positive way, rather in a normal base of grammar, and not with your herpy derpy angry mode blasting on me like your frikkin’ shoop da whoop or what not, that you would point me on my faults and on how to improve, that it wouldn’t get you more respect from users on MoparScape?<br>
Just to say, I am currently disrespecting you , just by how you comment on my topic.<br>
Just like I said, I can take feedback, but this isn’t feedback at all buddy.</p>
