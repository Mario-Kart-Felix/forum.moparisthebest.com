<p>Okay, theres a bug where last months servers still appear on the page instead of the new ones that has been paid today.<br>
Therefore we’re basically losing money/time for not being on the moparsponsor spot.</p>
<p>It was suppose to be like ‘bug report’ but meh.</p>

Cost $30 minimal for the advertising slot. So you do not have to pay that $475. However, there are other bidders. So sometimes $30 is too low, and you gotta step the game up to secure the spot.<br>

<p>He paid $475, though, didn’t he? It says it to the right of the box.[/quote]<br>
Yeah, probably because the other competitors were paying around that too.<br>
Right now the minimal bid to get up there is $150. WAY back when I wanted to do it, the minimal was like $250 +. And when I say to get on it, I mean to actually have a secured spot…</p>
