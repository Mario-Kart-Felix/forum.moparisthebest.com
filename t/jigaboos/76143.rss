    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Syndicated talk-radio personality Don Imus apologized Friday for calling members of the Rutgers University women&#39;s basketball team &quot;nappy-headed hos&quot; during a segment yesterday in his &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; show.

Imus and his producer and on-air sidekick, Bernard McGuirk, went on to further attack the black members of the team, calling them &quot;jigaboos and wannabees.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [url=http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=jigaboo]Princeton[/url] jigaboo means nigger. 


Well, shit man. At my highschool there was a guy on the field hockey team and a chick on the football team. All in the name of equality. Now I&#39;ve watched womens basketball, and there are no white people. I mean except the coaches, and they aren&#39;t even chicks. Of course I&#39;m sure there are some white chicks who play basketball, but I haven&#39;t seen them on the television so I&#39;m going to stick to my guns and say they don&#39;t exist. Just like black guys who play hockey.</description>

But if a white guy calls a group of black ladies a name, you would think he murdered a race by the media coverage.</p>
<p>Bottom line, get over it.  If we are supposed to believe that everyone is created equal, we need to ignore color all together, not publicize the differences every time someone says something.</p>

<p>Totally wrong. But if there are seperate leagues for women and men maybe there should be seperate leagues for black chicks and white chicks.</p>
<p>Sports leagues are supposed to be a meritocracy, but they aren’t because if we only let the best people play we would never let any women play. So we have seperate leagues for the girlies.

It would be racist, and it won’t happen because of incidents like that lady on the bus and so forth.</p>
