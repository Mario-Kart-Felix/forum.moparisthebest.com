    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/1-player-server/382603</link>
    <description>Who thinks this would an enjoyable experience? And I ask for you to consider it for a second.

Don&#39;t think of it as an MMORPG, think of it as an RPG you can get on Nintendos, PS2&#39;s, 360&#39;s etc.

Think of it as a RuneScape version of Final Fantasy, Zelda or [url=http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/165/165580p1.html]Baldur&#39;s Gate: Dark Alliance[/url] etc.
 
Running the Client would also call the Server, so it&#39;s just like turning on a console. Have a main menu, with New Game, Load Game or Options before the player rendering is initiated.

Have obelisks or altars which are save points in the game, just like in console games.

Have the Server be one big themed quest storyline, like a game you&#39;d buy from a shop, instead of running around aimlessly doing little quests.

Maybe even an Online mode like Call of Duty or GTA IV, but when you&#39;ve completed the storyline.

I&#39;ve always wanted to do this, and with a big enough imagination, this could be very captivating. 

I just want to know if you&#39;d ever play it?</description>

<p>Yes. I couldn’t remember the name of it exactly, but my point was that emulator’s use little, if any proprietary code, where as what he’s planning, using the client to make his own “game” will use a majority of the proprietary code(model rendering, model format, cache de/compression, cache format, etc.).[/quote]<br>

Kaitnieks was the original actually and they all moved to MITB.</p>
<p>If you’re telling me that everything we use has been custom written so it’s fine, and then in your previous post say that I’m using Jagex’s code so will be sued…</p>

Who said anything about updating? I’d just make a “number 2”, and besides, notice I said about an online mode…?</p>
<p>Plus, we’re all here messing with code that isn’t ours, popular or not, isn’t that the whole reason we are here, to rebel to Jagex.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s probably too much for me to accomplish on my own. I’ve been offered by someone to team up but they haven’t got back to me.</p>

              <p>I think this would be a rather good idea. If you could take the games maps and models and say put them into a 3d engine like that one person did with a fps and then say, take character models from some popular game like castle Vania and rebuild that characters look and use their animations for walking you could have it up in the sense of logging in in about 3 days. Good luck to you on this cause that actuly sounds pretty cool.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Wintercanon, post:54, topic:382603”]<span class="mention">@Rix_</span> originally I thought his plan was to not include the server side to the game with the client. So that clients would connect to the server but still experience a single player game. The advantage of this method is player data could be stored remotely to prevent character modification, as well as game updates that do not require you to re-download the game.</p>
<p>What I was suggesting was, if he were to use that method, instead of building a player list and looping through the updating of each player, create an instance of the world for each individual player. That world would implement Runnable and just handle local updating and npcs for the user the world is instanced to.</p>
<p>About the dynamic content of his server. If it is going to be single player it will need a lot more depth. More random actions occurring, as well as a world more interactive, that possibly changes slightly with player decisions. To implement this you would need to have event listeners and a fair few threaded processes running asynchronously so that the game can have a wide array of actions ticking at once.[/quote]<br>
EXACTLY how I’d <span class="bbcode-i">love</span> for it to be! But I could not put it in to code as beautifully as you described.</p>
<p>But spot on.</p>

              <p><span class="mention">@Rix_</span> originally I thought his plan was to not include the server side to the game with the client. So that clients would connect to the server but still experience a single player game. The advantage of this method is player data could be stored remotely to prevent character modification, as well as game updates that do not require you to re-download the game.</p>
<p>What I was suggesting was, if he were to use that method, instead of building a player list and looping through the updating of each player, create an instance of the world for each individual player. That world would implement Runnable and just handle local updating and npcs for the user the world is instanced to.</p>
<p>About the dynamic content of his server. If it is going to be single player it will need a lot more depth. More random actions occurring, as well as a world more interactive, that possibly changes slightly with player decisions. To implement this you would need to have event listeners and a fair few threaded processes running asynchronously so that the game can have a wide array of actions ticking at once.</p>

Just a suggestion to you, Mendorphins, if you ever write that game, you might want to include two modes: single-player mode and network mode. Just like Minecraft.</p>
