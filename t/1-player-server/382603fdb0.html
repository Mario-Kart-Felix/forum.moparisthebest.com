Don&amp;#39;t think of it as an MMORPG, think of it as an RPG you can get on Nintendos, PS2&amp;#39;s, 360&amp;#39;s etc.

2. No one here distributes the client. They upload it to another site, and have that site distribute it. That is totally legal. But if one were to host the client on their personal computer, and have users download it from their computer, that wouldn’t be legal. Basically, it’s like if you search “child porn” on Google, and a link to <a href="http://www.childprawns.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.childprawns.net/</a> or whatever showed up. Google wouldn’t receive any sort of legal issues, because they’re just providing a link to the content, not providing the content itself.<br>
3. Our goal here isn’t to “rebel against Jagex”. In making a RuneScape Emulator, you’re doing nothing against Jagex. Those who develop/play RuneScape Emulators either currently play RuneScape, or have ceased to play RuneScape. The goal of this site was to allow programmers to create a RuneScape Emulator where they could do whatever they wanted. Things they couldn’t do normally(Note: The original site, mitb, was created for RuneScape cheating. Emulators were created to provide an environment in which people could test their bots, SCAR scripts, etc.). Emulator development was then branched off into it’s own location.[/quote]<br>
Kaitnieks was the original actually and they all moved to MITB.</p>
<p>If you’re telling me that everything we use has been custom written so it’s fine, and then in your previous post say that I’m using Jagex’s code so will be sued…</p>
<p>1: You don’t know what I’m going to use yet.<br>
2: Make up your mind. Which one?</p>
<p>3: I give a bollocks about legal issues. I’ll survive.</p>

<p>Yes. I couldn’t remember the name of it exactly, but my point was that emulator’s use little, if any proprietary code, where as what he’s planning, using the client to make his own “game” will use a majority of the proprietary code(model rendering, model format, cache de/compression, cache format, etc.).</p>
