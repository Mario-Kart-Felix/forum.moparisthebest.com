    <title>CacheDownloader Problem [Rep ++]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cachedownloader-problem-rep/446156</link>
    <description>Hello I have posted a lot in the help sections but I am really new to coding. I have the general idea but I need help. I download the Reality-Scape source and client and I edited the sprites and backround in the cache part. I saved and compiled and it didn&#39;t work so I opened cachedownloader.java. There was 2 of them. I saw it had a download link in it so I edited the cache and made it perfect with my custom sprites, backgrounds, and customs models. I made everything to what it should be setup as. Then i want to dropbox, uploaded the zipped folder, and clicked get link. The link at the top looked wrong so I right clicked download and copied link address. I pasted it in where the other cache was and was feeling confident. I compiled cleanly. I compiled both source and client just in case. The when I went to run my client it game me a error relating to mapconfig or something. So i checked it out and the pictures will show you what came up. So my question is... how do I make the server accept my cache? The cache i put up for download:

              <p>Have you zipped it correctly?<br>
Not the cache folder itself, inside of it.<br>
If you have, is the name in signlink.java correct? Also make sure it is .ZIP not .RAR</p>
<p>Make sure you have done it all correctly.</p>
