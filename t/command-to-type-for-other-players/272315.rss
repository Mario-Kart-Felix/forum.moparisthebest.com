    <description>I wrote this but it fails... 

I&#39;m not great with private servers. So Help me out all I want is it to try for other people making them say things that they really don&#39;t want to say.... 
This is what I have... 

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;control&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Noob&quot;)) {
String[] args = command.split(&quot; &quot;);
String name = command.substring(6);
String s = String.parseInt(args[2]); // What goes here? no clue I dont think I was suppose to program it like this. 
try {
int p = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(name);
client c = (client) server.playerHandler.players[p];
c.plrText = s;
c.plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
}catch(Exception e) {
sM(name+&quot; either isn&#39;t online or doesn&#39;t exist&quot;);
}
}[/code][br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 10, 2009, 12:50:13 pm[/size][hr]No Ideas?</description>
