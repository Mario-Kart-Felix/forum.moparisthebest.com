    <description>Hey Guys, Well i have portforward, Used Portforward.com programme and its telling me my ports are open, but i have a problem.

I Have been though all the client&#39;s files and even used zFilesearch.java to check that i have changed all the IP&#39;s (127.0.0.1) to My No-ip.

Then i have compiled it and load up the server and the client and i still cant connect to the server with my no-ip.

It&#39;s been a while since i have made a RSPS but if im right,

With PI, Do i connect to my own server with 127.0.0.1 and everyone else connects with the &#39;No-ip&#39;?

Or should it be possible for [u]me[/u] to connect to the server with the No-Ip as well?</description>

              <p>You have to change the IP to 0.0.0.0 in your client and your NO-IP in your server files if I am correct. You have to have your client set to 0.0.0.0 for you to logon to your own server and other people need it set to the NO-IP</p>
