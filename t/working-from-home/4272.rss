    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/working-from-home/4272</link>
    <description>Hello. I was wondering , I see alot of this stuff on TV but it seems like a bunch of crap , but im in really desperate need. I was wondering if anyone has any Ebooks or website information , ect about all of these working from home plans. I have a part time job and my mom cant have a job because she just had a kid and were in desperate need for her to find maybe one of those do it yourself sell from home things online. Any little info on starting those work at home things would be GREATLY apprieciated. Sorry im not trying to sound like a sob story but were in desperate need for her to find a way to work from home. Thanks alot for any information you can provide!</description>

<p>My dad works at home, but he is a physicist who writes compression algorithims, I don’t know how many people could do that :.</p>
