    <title>Anyone interested in bug abuse?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-interested-in-bug-abuse/523432</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for someone trustworthy and who I won&#39;t have to teach EVERYTHING about it too, I&#39;ve been glitching for a while so I know most of what to look for and where, and I don&#39;t mind teaching some things, but I want a partner who is willing to learn AND WORK, not just leach when I find something, someone who will compliment my finds by adding new ideas into the mix.</description>

              <p>As in bug abuse for GP? I made 6k USD split 2 ways in 2011 abusing an xlog bug, and not a leaked one. By selling the GP I made it was a high complexity bug, that required at a minimum of 3 accounts, I used 12 accounts to speed up the process though and a bot that was specially designed for the bug to make it work better.</p>
