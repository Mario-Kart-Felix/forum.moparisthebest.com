    <title>What can I expect from this gaming laptop?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-can-i-expect-from-this-gaming-laptop/545652</link>
    <description>Just landed an awesome deal on a laptop from a friend, doesn&#39;t have a charger but who gives a shit. Let me just go over it the specs, prices, blah blah.. My main questions are at the bottom.

The souped up specs..
Installed RAM: Base market RAM for this laptop is 12gb, expandable up to 16gb, hopefully it&#39;s already at 16gb.
Hard drive space: 1TB (SATA/5400RPM - plenty for me. I&#39;ve had a 320gb for three years and only used 200)
OS: Windows 8 64-bit (The first thing I&#39;m doing is downgrading to Windows 7)
Screen: 15.6&quot; 1080p with 150 viewing angles.
Processor: Intel Core i7-4700HQ @ 2.4GHz (6M L3 Cache, up to 3.4GHz)
Graphics Card: Nvidia GTX 760M GDDR5 2GB (Dedicated)
Optical Drive: BlueRay R/RW
Ports: [USB 3.0 x4][VGA x 1][HDMI x 1][Microphone][SPDIF]

More special features..
- Includes Bang &amp; Olufsen ICEpower, Sonic Master audio
- Backlit Keyboard


Retail Price: $1,200.00
I&#39;m paying: $170.00 + Charger (no more than $30.00)

My Questions.. You don&#39;t have to answer them all, some insight will be nice!
0.5) How good of a deal did I just get?
1) What can I expect from this laptop business wise. I have hundreds of windows open, Excel, Word, etc.. All at once.
2) What kind of games could I handle? BF3? Skyrim? Etc.
3) Tips for downgrading to Windows 7?
4) Is the battery life of only 5 hours a bad thing? :(
5) Since I probably won&#39;t play games much, should I sell it for ~$800 and spend $400 on a decent laptop?
6) Would missing stickers change the price I can sell it for?

Sorry I have so many questions, I haven&#39;t really dealt with gaming laptops before, just average business laptops. Thanks to anyone that has some insight! 
Thanks,</description>

How do you know? What if it causes her constant pain, and she has to pay for meds. That disability could help pay for them.<br>

Don’t make assumptions about people.</p>
<p>I’ve got minor scoliosis and some other issue from getting in a car accident. It doesn’t look like I’m in pain, nor do people ever really notice I’ve got scoliosis (hell I didn’t even know until I went to the ER for the accident).<br>
Whenever I wake up in the morning my back is in terrible pain, I don’t even want to move because it hurts so much.</p>
<p>Yet I do what I can to ignore/avoid the pain and just get on with my day. Because I gotta.</p>

I would estimate this computer (as a desktop) to cost around $700 to build. That’s ridiculous.</p>

3) Tips for downgrading to Windows 7?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If it had windows 8 stock, you’d have to plug the hardrive into a desktop and wipe to install windows 7 Microsoft did this weird shit to it I had to do that with my laptop… maybe yours is different[/quote]</p>
<p>I had this problem too. This laptop doesn’t support Windows 7 (Faaacckk…) but I still needed to wipe it because my friend managed to get a virus on it. Getting it to enter BIOS while booting is a pain in the ass. You literally have 15ms to press the f10 key… Anyways, now Windows 8.1 64-bit and it runs games great. Haven’t had many problems with Windows 8 yet. Skyrim runs fine on full specs at 1960x1080p resolution, so does Watchdogs. Currently installing COD: Ghosts. Will post results…</p>

Or you can get a thumb drive and just run Active @ KillDisk and wipe the drive.<br>
Or you can run the windows 7 installer and format the hard drive via “Custom Installation”.<br>
Or you can just get linux.</p>

              <p>It’s a gaming laptop so you have to remember that you’re giving up a fair amount of battery life. I don’t really see why this is such a problem for most people. Anywhere that I have taken my laptop, there has been a power source nearby. Hell, I have no problem rolling out an extension cord whenever I need to. It’s most likely going to get very heated and I suggest a cooling pad. Especially when gaming.</p>
<p>The 760M is a bit outdated now (off the top of my head) but it will play the simple things. If you’re looking to play LoL or something like DOTA, I doubt you’re going to have too many issues. If you do, just tone everything down. This doesn’t mean you should go installing Crysis 3 with ultra graphics and expect 60fps. No, that’s unrealistic. There’s plenty of places that you can check the performance of individual parts and I suggest you do so. I think a GeForce GTX 870M is suggested when buying a new gaming laptop so that it can run well for the next 2-3 years.</p>
<p>Depending on how you use your laptop, 16gb RAM will possibly be overkill. 16gb will carry you over the next few years so I suppose it provides a little more future proofing. It’s certainly not going to be too little right now. It shouldn’t give you any trouble. Most gaming mid-range gaming laptops offer 8gb of RAM at the moment, so that should give you some idea.</p>
<p>Downgrading is completely up to you. I’ve only gone in the upgrade direction, but I’m sure it’s fairly easy once you grab a key and google a tutorial or two. It seems as though the main use of your laptop will be forum browsing, reddit, youtube and perhaps some school work? For that, the laptop is overkill and I don’t suggest selling it because it does what you/will continue to for a long time. As for the stickers, most likely not. Who knows though. In the end, it’s up to the individual. If you’re implying that the laptop has a little bit of damage or is showing some age, then the value will decrease. Yes.</p>
<p>I’m not a hardware guy so take what I say with a grain of salt.</p>

              <p>Just landed an awesome deal on a laptop from a friend, doesn’t have a charger but who gives a shit. Let me just go over it the specs, prices, blah blah… My main questions are at the bottom.</p>
<p>The souped up specs…<br>
Installed RAM: Base market RAM for this laptop is 12gb, expandable up to 16gb, hopefully it’s already at 16gb.<br>
Hard drive space: 1TB (SATA/5400RPM - plenty for me. I’ve had a 320gb for three years and only used 200)<br>
OS: Windows 8 64-bit (The first thing I’m doing is downgrading to Windows 7)<br>
Screen: 15.6" 1080p with 150 viewing angles.<br>
Processor: Intel Core i7-4700HQ @ 2.4GHz (6M L3 Cache, up to 3.4GHz)<br>

<p>My Questions… You don’t have to answer them all, some insight will be nice!<br>
0.5) How good of a deal did I just get?</p>
<ol>
<li>What can I expect from this laptop business wise. I have hundreds of windows open, Excel, Word, etc… All at once.</li>
<li>What kind of games could I handle? BF3? Skyrim? Etc.</li>
<li>Tips for downgrading to Windows 7?</li>
<li>Is the battery life of only 5 hours a bad thing? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">
</li>
<li>Since I probably won’t play games much, should I sell it for ~$800 and spend $400 on a decent laptop?</li>
<li>Would missing stickers change the price I can sell it for?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry I have so many questions, I haven’t really dealt with gaming laptops before, just average business laptops. Thanks to anyone that has some insight!<br>
Thanks,</p>
