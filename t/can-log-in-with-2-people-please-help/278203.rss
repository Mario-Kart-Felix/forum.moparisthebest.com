              <p>What connection are you using for port forwarding? If it’s Hamachi then you should try renewing and getting a new connection, that can sometimes help, if it’s No-IP it’s a problem with your server because usually they don’t screw up, but you can try renewing that too. Also if your using a web client not a download able one that can sometimes mess it up.</p>
