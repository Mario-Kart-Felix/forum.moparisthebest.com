    <description>Do ya&#39; think all the anti-competitive stuff would have been looked at differently if everyone would have known the impact all that money gates earned would eventually have? 


&lt;blockquote&gt;Say what you will about Bill Gates but there is no denying that he has had an impressive impact on our society during his leadership at Microsoft and continues to be a force of change through his foundation along with his wife Melinda.

According to the figures in the infographic Bill Gates has given $28 Billion to various charities since 2007, which apparently accounts for almost 48% of his net-worth.

One of his biggest charitable efforts has been towards the eradication of malaria and an end to polio. He was also instrumental in the creation of The Living Pledge which is an effort to get the riches people in the world to publicly commit to giving away half their net-worth in their lifetime.

The multi-billionaire Warren Buffet is probably the most well known name to take the pledge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>Sorry, is this reddit original content? It’s a site used by millions of people, if we’re not going to post things that are of interest because they’re on reddit, there won’t be anything left for us to post and start our own discussion on here.</p>

<blockquote>Say what you will about Bill Gates but there is no denying that he has had an impressive impact on our society during his leadership at Microsoft and continues to be a force of change through his foundation along with his wife Melinda.
<p>According to the figures in the infographic Bill Gates has given $28 Billion to various charities since 2007, which apparently accounts for almost 48% of his net-worth.</p>
<p>One of his biggest charitable efforts has been towards the eradication of malaria and an end to polio. He was also instrumental in the creation of The Living Pledge which is an effort to get the riches people in the world to publicly commit to giving away half their net-worth in their lifetime.</p>
<p>The multi-billionaire Warren Buffet is probably the most well known name to take the pledge.</p>
