    <title>Webclient IP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-ip/335997</link>
    <description>I have recently got my webclient working after days of failure and for what? More failure. I can&#39;t seem to get my IP to set on the webclient, I am using bluurrs client and the IP is managed through GUI.java. So I think that is what is causing the problem problem. If anyone has any ideas/fixes please throw them at me. I need it. XD
