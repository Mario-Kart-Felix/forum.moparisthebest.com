    <description>Hey,

I need a bit of help . I tried &amp; failed. hahaha

I was trying to make a code so that you need playerrights &gt;= 3 to wield a certain item... Can anyone help please?
Also is there a way to remove an item from EVERYONE that has ever played on your server? Like when they login it gets removed?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 27, 2008, 01:45:54 AM[/size][hr]*bump*</description>
