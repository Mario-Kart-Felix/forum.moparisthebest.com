    <title>LocalHost Connection Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/localhost-connection-issue/349248</link>
    <description>There is a problem connecting to my server from my client locally.
Every time I start the server and try to connect it says &quot;Null Disconnected &lt;localhost&gt;&quot;.
This wasn&#39;t happening yesterday and I haven&#39;t made any changes.. wtf???
It&#39;s delta-based btw, but that doesn&#39;t matter cause I sent it to my friend and it works for him.</description>
