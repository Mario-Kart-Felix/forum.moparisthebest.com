    <description>hello, im using a server thats compatible with pwnscape v3 client. however i followed a guide to make a web client. Im was having some problems. firstly the ip address the jar is connecting to is always localhost even though in the gui.java its the correct one. secondly alot of buttons were missing in the jar version. Can anyone help me? is there like a guide for this type of server specifically or something? thnks.</description>

              <p>the buttons i mean like the music buttons and stuff like that, i think it gets those buttons from somewhere else cause the the v3 client connects somewhere when it starts and if im not mistaken, it gets some pics and data. bu does anyone know what other client works with the pwnscape v3 server, well client that doesnt scrable ur character. thnks</p>

              <p>The buttons. Do you mean the JFrame buttons?<br>
Because i dont think it uses that with Pwnscape 3 client<br>
Well, try with a different client perhaps?</p>
