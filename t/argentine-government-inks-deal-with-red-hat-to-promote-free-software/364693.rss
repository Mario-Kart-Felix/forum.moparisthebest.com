    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;The agreement will allow the migration of solutions already in use Argentina&#39;s public administration to open source platform, which will enable savings to the state of software licensing fees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>I admit I was wrong with my predictions about FOOS and governments in my last post.</p>
<p>However I still think FOOS goes against free market principles because they rely on having incentives to do stuff.</p>
<p>If your company makes bad software, you’ll go out of business and end up starving to death, thus everybody will try to make good software.<br>
FOOS people volunteer their spare time to contribute to a FOOS project with no promise of monetary return. If they make bad software that nobody uses… nothing happens. They have no incentive to make their software better.</p>
<p>So free market principles predict that paid-for software will always be better than FOOS.</p>
<p>I reckoned neo-liberal governments wouldn’t want to use FOOS because that would mean admitting the market isn’t always perfect. But since they have, I think that means these governments are not as right-wing as I thought they would be.</p>

I believe that for 99% of their work, open source variations of Microsoft software would suffice. MS Word, as an example, is extremely bloated with bells and whistles these days – that’s what they compete with now.<br>
Anyone happy with using a word processor as a word processor, rather than wanting to produce extremely fancy documents, can make do with Open Office.</p>
<p>Having said that, vendor lock in is a big problem in the academic realm. I find that documents I make in Open Office don’t come out as I expect when they’re opened in MS Word. I choose to do things like essays on the university computers for that reason.</p>
<p>I imagine that MS Excel would have some <span class="bbcode-b">useful</span> features that the Open Office version doesn’t, but I don’t use it so I could be wrong.</p>

Lol Lol Lol. Well I personally recommend Windows Vista to all of my friends for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It strengthens the software industry.</li>
<li>It helps the long-term competitiveness of orsm high-cost software.</li>
<li>It doesn’t create an artificial preference for free software.</li>
<li>It succeeds at building respect for intellectual property rights.</li>
<li>It lets them choose the best solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ergo, concordantly – vis a vis. You know what… Those last 3 words, in that order, make no sense. I just thought it would sound cool like Will Ferrell did when he portrayed the Architect in MTV’s Matrix parody years ago.</p>

<p>I think the reason they’re afraid of open source is even though an up-to-date Linux system is VERY secure, a Legacy install, that hasn’t had patches is very vulnerable.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They could skip right past Linux and use OpenBSD where appropriate if their primary concern is security – OpenBSD has a full disclosure policy when it comes to security flaws, excellent documentation (probably not as good as FreeBSD’s though), and it’s configured properly right out of the box. If the box remains properly configured after extra services are enabled (ie, everything runs with minimum permissions and so on) then I really doubt someone would get in remotely using anything less than a brute force attack.<br>
Apparently they’ve had only 2 security issues with the default installation in the last decade.</p>
<p>Anyway, the best thing about OpenBSD is that every aspect of the primary software is under BSD code; it doesn’t ship with GPL’d code by default iirc, unlike FreeBSD. So it’s ‘free’ as in freedom, not ‘free’ as in ‘free, but…’ – the governments using such software could make in-house changes appropriate to the environment they’re using it in without being compelled to share those changes. I imagine a government would value this.</p>

<p>Because a legacy install of Windows that hasn’t had patches isn’t vulnerable?  There are many outstanding issues with Windows that are still not patched, and the organization doesn’t have the option to write their own patch either.</p>
