    <description>i pretty much just started and i don&#39;t know much about scripts.  i jus know a few basic java online ones so im pretty much stupid.  so i was told to delete the stuff in the characters folder then to use compiler by someone, cause i wanted to log in again.  i couldn&#39;t log in other servers, it always said the server has an error.  but now since i didn&#39;t know which compiler to use i chose them at random so now i can&#39;t even log into a server i wanna make.  it says im logged in already no matter how weird a name i put so i really need help.  here&#39;s what the console says:
