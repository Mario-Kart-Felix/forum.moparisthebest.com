    <title>Help please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-please/156364</link>
    <description>Well me and my dad were working on making fires disappear after certain amount of seconds, so we just made it for all objects.  I have trees deleting after 5 seconds(woodcutting skillcape emote) and stuff like that.  My dad made a .txt file with all this
[code]public class delayobject
{
	private int absX = 0;
	private int absY = 0;
	private int delayTime = 0;
	private long beginSecond = 0;

	public delayobject(final int argAbsX, final int argAbsY, final int argDelayTime)
	{
		this.absX = argAbsX;
		this.absY = argAbsY;
		this.delayTime = argDelayTime * 1000;
		this.beginSecond = System.currentTimeMillis();
	}

	public int getAbsX()
	{
		return this.absX;
	}

	public int getAbsY()
	{
		return this.absY;
	}

	public boolean shouldBeRemoved()
	{
		boolean shouldBeRemoved = false;
		long endSecond = 0;
		long deltaSecond = 0;

		endSecond = System.currentTimeMillis();
		deltaSecond = endSecond - this.beginSecond;
		
		if (deltaSecond &gt;= delayTime)
		{
			shouldBeRemoved = true;
		}

		return shouldBeRemoved;
	}
}[/code]
and in client.java he added this stuff
[code]public ArrayList delayObjects = new ArrayList();[/code]
[code]public void removeDelayObjects()
{	
	delayobject delayObject = null;
	int x = 0;
	int y = 0;

	try
	{
		for (int i=0; i &lt; delayObjects.size(); i++)
		{
        		delayObject = (delayobject)delayObjects.get(i);
			if (delayObject.shouldBeRemoved())
			{
				x = delayObject.getAbsX();
				y = delayObject.getAbsY();

				deletethatobject(x, y);

				delayObjects.remove(i);
				i--;
			}
		}
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{
		misc.println(&quot;In removeDelayObjects method:  catch encountered&quot;);
	}
}[/code]
[code]removeDelayObjects();[/code]
It works fine, except for one thing.  It deletes on your screen when u make the object, but on no one elses.  When someone else does the wc skillcape emote, the tree appears for everyone, but only disappears for person who made it, and is still there on my screen.  Please tell me why this is happening.  And another thing...when i compile i get this note, not an error, just a note.

The first two notes are there on everyone&#39;s unless u fixed it, but after my dad did this thing, client.java all of a sudden uses unchecked or unsafe operations. 


So basically i&#39;m asking how do i make it disappear on everyone&#39;s screens, and if u can, how to fix the compile notes.</description>
