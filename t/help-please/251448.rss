              <p>you can only open one runserver.bat…<br>
use <a href="http://www.no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.no-ip.com</a>, not duck v2.2.1 or w/e that is<br>
Set your compiler to the jdk you have</p>
<p>Should work then (also theres a anti leech in delta_ release so it may appear with alot of nulls and when you login/tele you die.</p>
