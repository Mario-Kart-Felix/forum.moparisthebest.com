    <description>This is using Quantum 639 - Dementhium 639. I was trying to make 4 pairs of donator gloves depending on how much you donate. Gloves to XP rates.

Gloves 1 *2 XP
Gloves 2 *3 XP
Gloves 3 *4 XP
Gloves 4 *5 XP

This is what i added to Player.java
[code]

	public boolean inArena = false;
	public boolean wearGloves1(Player p) {
	 if	(p.getEquipment().getSlot(Equipment.SLOT_HANDS) == 11136) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
	}
	
	public boolean wearGloves2(Player p) {
		 if	(p.getEquipment().getSlot(Equipment.SLOT_HANDS) == 11138) {
			return true;
		} else {
			return false;
		}
		}
	
	public boolean wearGloves3(Player p) {
		 if	(p.getEquipment().getSlot(Equipment.SLOT_HANDS) == 11140) {
			return true;
		} else {
			return false;
		}
		}
	
	public boolean wearGloves4(Player p) {
		 if	(p.getEquipment().getSlot(Equipment.SLOT_HANDS) == 19754) {
			return true;
		} else {
			return false;
		}
		}
[/code]

Skills.java
[code]
if (skill == ATTACK || skill == DEFENCE || skill == STRENGTH || skill == RANGE || skill == MAGIC || skill == HITPOINTS || skill == PRAYER || skill == COOKING || skill == WOODCUTTING || skill == FLETCHING || skill == FISHING || skill == FIREMAKING || skill == CRAFTING || skill == SMITHING || skill == MINING || skill == HERBLORE || skill == AGILITY || skill == THIEVING || skill == SLAYER || skill == FARMING || skill == RUNECRAFTING || skill == CONSTRUCTION || skill == HUNTER || skill == SUMMONING || skill == DUNGEONEERING &amp;&amp; player.wearGloves1(player) == true) {

		}

		    experience = exp * GLOVES_2;	
		}
		if (skill == ATTACK || skill == DEFENCE || skill == STRENGTH || skill == RANGE || skill == MAGIC || skill == HITPOINTS || skill == PRAYER || skill == COOKING || skill == WOODCUTTING || skill == FLETCHING || skill == FISHING || skill == FIREMAKING || skill == CRAFTING || skill == SMITHING || skill == MINING || skill == HERBLORE || skill == AGILITY || skill == THIEVING || skill == SLAYER || skill == FARMING || skill == RUNECRAFTING || skill == CONSTRUCTION || skill == HUNTER || skill == SUMMONING || skill == DUNGEONEERING &amp;&amp; player.wearGloves3(player) == true) {
		    experience = exp * GLOVES_3;	
		}
		if (skill == ATTACK || skill == DEFENCE || skill == STRENGTH || skill == RANGE || skill == MAGIC || skill == HITPOINTS || skill == PRAYER || skill == COOKING || skill == WOODCUTTING || skill == FLETCHING || skill == FISHING || skill == FIREMAKING || skill == CRAFTING || skill == SMITHING || skill == MINING || skill == HERBLORE || skill == AGILITY || skill == THIEVING || skill == SLAYER || skill == FARMING || skill == RUNECRAFTING || skill == CONSTRUCTION || skill == HUNTER || skill == SUMMONING || skill == DUNGEONEERING &amp;&amp; player.wearGloves4(player) == true) {
		    experience = exp * GLOVES_4;	
		}
[/code]

When I compile, I don&#39;t get any errors but they gloves still don&#39;t work. I think I need to add a check for it to look for when you wear the gloves? Help please.</description>

Hmm… Did you declare your ‘GLOVES_#’ to its corresponding factor?</p>
