    <description>Hello there, im currently coding a project.
This will be a server that will be online based of a Dodian Source (Due to its stability).
This server is not for it to be released but for it to be played by players.
I plan to work with any coders who&#39;s applications are strong.
I plan to add:
All Skills
A Combat Minigame
Barrows
Godwars
Silab Items
and many more things...
If you are interested in this please contact me at hani-rules@hotmail.co.uk
If you are not interested please do not spam or flam.
