    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-please/127855</link>
    <description>Thank you if you are reading this topic please only post if you have valuable information if your just gonna say learn java or you suck. Because if i had half a clue where to start learning java beilive me i would i have tried many tutorials on it and its so confusing.

On topic i have made a special pk area when you type ::propk you tele to it and you can pk but I want to add monsters and i have got a autospawn generator and i get the co-ords and everything right and when i put it in my autospawn folder and i compile then run the monsters do not appear. Is there something else i have to do in order to achieve what i want?

Any one that posts thanks in advance, Also if any of you pro-coders have any links what got you setup learning java please post them to. anyone?</description>
