    <description>My coder, Kaitou is busy working on a project right now and too busy to code. And i&#39;m trying to learn to code so I don&#39;t have to rely on the coder.

I have a few problems I need help to fix. I have been googling and youtubing but still haven&#39;t found the answers.

1. How do I fix Piety and Chivarly?
   Well, whenever I click on either one of these two prayers, it lits up but immediately goes out. It dosnt turn on..

2. How do I fix my Ancient/lunar tele spells?
    The normal spells works except for the teleport ones, please help.

3.  How do I add D claws and gs specs on NPCs?
     I &quot;had&quot; dragon claw spec working on NPCs before, but it only does the first damage.

4.  How do I change a monster&#39;s max hit?


My server is 317.

Please help me! I&#39;ll be glad to rep.</description>
