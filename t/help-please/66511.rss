    <description>Well, I followed all of the TuT&#39;s that I can find about Port-Forwarding, and yet I still can&#39;t Port-Forward. So I&#39;ve went to my last straw and finally decided to post a topic on the boards. Anyways, here&#39;s the information that I think you&#39;d need to help me.

My Router - [URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img251.imageshack.us/img251/3757/faer6ekr6.png[/img][/URL]

I can access my router, and go to Port-Forwarding and there&#39;s this [URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img410.imageshack.us/img410/6086/asfqp0.png[/img][/URL]

and when I go and choose Add Server this shows up [URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img61.imageshack.us/img61/5568/asdftt3.png[/img][/URL]

As you can see, I attempted to make my own network already. But when I had a friend of mine try to log into my server from Hamachi, he said it did not work so I really don&#39;t know what I am doing wrong.[br][size=1]Posted on: March 10, 2007, 04:45:29 PM[/size][hr]Anyone?[br][size=1]Posted on: March 10, 2007, 05:02:08 PM[/size][hr]Someone?</description>

              <p>first u need to make a static ip…</p>
<p>and use like ur ip for ur router that u typed in at the top in address bar and for example: mine is 192.168.1.1 and i made it to 192.168.1.50</p>
<p>try subnet as 255.255.255.0 and gateway what u have at ur address bar ip</p>
<p>any service name and ports 43594 to 43594 and then the ip that u made like 192.168.1.50 like mine</p>
<p>try it</p>
<p>or go to your router website (netgear site) and try to live chat with them and ask them to tell you how to set a static ip and do port forwarding for a private server.</p>
