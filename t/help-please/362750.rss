    <description>ok thanks for reading my post.

i have a 317 delta, ok have found a non fixed dupe method and was wondering if any one knows how to fix it.

method:
open 2 clients log into 2 different accounts.
both  go into wild and skull one of the 2 accounts.
once 1 is skulled range that player till he is almost dead.
click the x to logout on the client toolbar and log back in.
the skulled player who died is alive in the attacked spot and has items still while a second set is on the ground.


ok so how would i fix this? and yes i have herd of the tut 1 connection per ip but i got errors doing that tut.</description>
