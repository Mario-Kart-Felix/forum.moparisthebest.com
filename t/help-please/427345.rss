    <description>Okay , i have been reasearching for a long peroid of time of how to fix my problem , i have try&#39;d many things but its still not working i&#39;ll tell you my issue.

Okay , i had a black out , and my router turned off , and then we turned everything back on , after that i turned back on my computer to log back in and host my pking server , but it does not log me in and i have unplugged my router many times , and i checked if &quot;I PV4 Address&quot; has changed. And it has not changed , but later i rebooted my router from my router website which is &quot;192.168.0.1&quot; and i even done it off my other website &quot;192.168.1.1&quot; which is the website i portforwarded on, and it changed and i re portforwarded. And my server is still not logging me in , also my mates told me to download utorrent and port 43594 in prefrences and connection , place and i done it , and its still not logging me in. Also when i check if my no-ip is working on google server status checker it says its offline when really it is online. So if anyone out there is willing to help me i will pay $5 on paypal, because i worked hard on this server. 

Thanks Joe ,</description>
