<p>Yeah especially communities that branch off from sites like this. They make a site almost exactly the same. At most, 20 will join but probably under 5. Pretty much the only way to have a successful mitb clone is for this forum to die, and the vast majority of elite members move to the new community.</p>

<p>You’re ignorant, and incapable of making a forum. Even if you did make one, the community would be a failure. Wasted space on the internet.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.zetaboards.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.zetaboards.com</a>, there, you will learn how to make a forum.</p>
