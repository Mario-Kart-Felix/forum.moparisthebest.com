    <description>Alright so I have no idea why nobody can connect to my server I portforwarded and everything and it all should be right but when I go to canyouseeme.org it says my connection has timed out and that my ports aren&#39;t open I also changed all the connect ips in my source ( not sure if I am missing any though) I just don&#39;t know why nobody can connect to my server I have done everything right, if someone could get on teamviewer and check things out for me that would be greatly appreciated.</description>
