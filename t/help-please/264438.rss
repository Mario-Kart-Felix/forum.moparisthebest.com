    <description>Hey i need help alot.
Well is there a way you can make a server without portforwarding if you have a router,Because i have a router and im not allowed to take it away.

If you help you will get Admin on my server and i will try to make the leetest server ever.(i made 1 before when i didnt have a router it was awesome)

Also I don&#39;t Know the path for JDK 6 update 12 so please tell me.

Thanks,
