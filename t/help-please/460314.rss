<p>i did that, The server was on mopar for the night, but when i got home from school it wasnt there. I checked the ips in the client i uploaded, checked the ip in my router and everythings good. People can login to my server, ive basically done everything that i could think of.</p>

<p>Perhaps your server went offline somehow.</p>

<p>Most likely because you never confirmed it, you have to do two things to finalize the procedure.<br>
Firstly, go to the activation link that Moparscape provides you, from the computer/VPS that the server is hosted on.<br>
Secondly, you need to make sure Moparscape is able to log into your server, this is to verify that it’s online.<br>
I’d recommend going over the procedure again, and follow/read the steps correctly.</p>
