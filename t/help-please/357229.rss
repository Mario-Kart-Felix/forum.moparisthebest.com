    <description>Im using an exion&#39;s base server and client which is based off of Project Insanity. I can not find out where to put my models for custom items Ive tryed everywhere there is no models folder I dont even no where the models are that the client supports i have tryed hiding then un hidding it makes no difference the files arent hidden there just not here. All I have found is a file called models.idx which I dont no how or what i need to open idx files because with notepad its a bunch of random stuff and theres another called models.dat which when I try to open in datmaker I get a message that sais invalid file format. Other than that in a folder called data theres a bunch of .dat files but they wont open in datmaker eaither and theres only like 20 so I dont think there the item models but thats the only place where a bunch of .dat files are it doesnt make any sense.

any help is apreciated.</description>
