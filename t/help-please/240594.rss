    <description>I was browsing the tutorial section and saw a tut to add commander Zilyana to the client. So i add the models and ints, and it comes up with some wierd skeleton thing. i then copy my ints and models for it to another client and it works perfectly. Is there some way i could make it work on my first client? It worked on Deltascape client, but not on Richscape client. Please Help?</description>
