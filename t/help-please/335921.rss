    <description>Ok so i&#39;ve been playing other moparscape servers wich has been expiring me to create my own server.
But im having some problems:
1-I have downloaded no-ip but i don&#39;t have a host(why should i have hosts?)
2-About the path and classpath (there were 2 of them already the TMP and the TEMP i creater 2 new ones and putted the code of the soul guide)
3-I&#39;ve download already my source (but shouldn&#39;t it already do something because it says no path specifed)
4-i did the ipconfig and i have 2 gateways things 1 at the beggining and the other at the end the first one has some numbers the last one just has some :: )
5-When i imput my gateway it asks for a username and a password should i put an email in name?
