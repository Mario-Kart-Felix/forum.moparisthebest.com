    <description>Can anyone help me with this?
Interfaces: I&#39;ve seen shops/stores and etc with custom interfaces like Death-Pvpz v4 with loyalty interface shop. 
How do I create or get this? I wanna create or get my own like that.

Prayer: I seen custom prayer&#39;s and stuff. Like added extra prayer&#39;s (customs) with magic attacks. How do I add those with the protection prayer&#39;s. How do I change the picture&#39;s to something I want it to be?

Custom icons/crowns: Where do I place my crown pack? I downloaded one and idk where to place.

AND ALL OF THE ABOVE OTHER THAN CODING AND ETC.
