    <description>Well, this is getting REALLY annoying... when me and my friend are fighting eachother, pking, etc... when I hit them alot of times the damage dealt shows up as if it were poison damage? It gets really annoying because half of the time I cant even see what im hitting... I am sure this is probably an easy fix im just not sure on how to do it, so any help would be greatly appreciated.</description>
