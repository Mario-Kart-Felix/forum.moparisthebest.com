question 1
I just figured out how to make a server.  I am very happy,but I dont know how to make people owners.  I am using Hellzend source.  My server is running and everything,and I know how to make people mods and admins.  on my server u go to data and open the text file of the thing you want such as administrators.txt
and add the name u want ,but i dont know how to make people owners. if any of u could help me i would be happy 

question 2
 do any of you know where all of my charactors are being saved to.  I know in other servers it gets saved in a folder called characters , moreinfo,or saved games something like that.  But a few people have made charactors in my server and it saves there files,but I dont know where.  if you guys know where plz tell me.

question 3
when I try to log into moparscape it comes up with this big white square.  It wont show the 2 mopars or logon or anything.  It still has the sdvertisments on the sides,and the buttons on top of the screen such as forums,etc if any of you guys/girls have every had anything like this happen to you please tell me how to fix it.  This is my first question on these forums.  Im new. You people r probubly laughing right now because the answer to all these questions r in plain sight,but i cat really find them. thank you for all ur help</description>

3…this happens to me all you need to do is close the window and re open it if that dose not work restart your pc</p>
