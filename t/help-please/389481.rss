    <title>[HELP] Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-please/389481</link>
    <description>Allright, so:

I&#39;ve had my Server posted on the serverstatus page, I hosted it on my local Ip-adress.
Once i have enough money for buying vps, i bought them and reposted it without thinking i had already posted my server so i got banned.
Now, My server was at 70% Uptime so it&#39;s about 55% now, Once it has been removed, could i get a unban for my VPS ip adress?
Local ip: 84.107.169.94 (www.voterunescar.tk) is the page where it is on.
VpsIP: 64.186.152.212 this one is currently banned,

May i have unban once my Local ip has been removed?
AND: I already sended an PM to Moparisthebest but no answer for a week, hes probably busy.

Thank you,

Jeff</description>
