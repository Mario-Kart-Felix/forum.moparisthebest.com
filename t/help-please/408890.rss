    <description>Need a person who is willing to be on msn and help me out now and then give me some tips.

So my problem is when adding a custom item. I have added the ints and the models it is when i try to add it to the source on the items list.

So my server is fine when i dont have torva on it but then i add it to the items list and save then click run it says

exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.numberFormatexception:for input string

About a file in would - items - items - items loader

Looking on trying to solve this badly i want to start solving some bugs on it aswell so need some help on them.

Its a drowningscape source and a base by pali.

Thanks Tas

when you add it to the items list, make sure you use tabs and not space bar.</p>
