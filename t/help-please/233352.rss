    <description>ok so i wana make it so when u talk to an NPC he says how long until the next tourniment. this is my code so far:

[code]case 2909:
				sendFrame200(4883, 591);
				sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4884);
				sendFrame126(&quot;Would you like to go to the PK tourny area?&quot;, 4885);
				sendFrame126(&quot;Click here to continue&quot;, 4886);
				sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4883);
				sendFrame164(4882);
				NpcDialogueSend = true;
				break;
case 2910:
				sendFrame200(4883, 591);
				sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4884);
				sendFrame126(&quot;There is a tourniment in &quot; + counter + &quot;.&quot;4885);
				sendFrame126(&quot;Click here to continue&quot;, 4886);
				sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4883);
				sendFrame164(4882);
				NpcDialogueSend = true;
                                                      break;
[/code]
i have my counter set up to count down and everything but when u talk to him he just says the same number every time u talk to him the number wont count down. this is my counter code: 
[code]			case 121:
				// we could use this to make the char appear for other players only until
				// this guys loading is done. Also wait with regular player updates
				// until we receive this command.
				//public boolean process() {// is being called regularily every 500ms
				if (counter &gt; 0) {
				counter -= 1;
				}[/code]
and
[code]public int counter = 600;[/code]
