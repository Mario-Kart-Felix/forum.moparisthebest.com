    <title>Help Please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-please/401524</link>
    <description>Sup Moparscape community, Ive been searching your forums for months now, just never made an account.

For the past several weeks, Ive been trying to find out how to Start / Run my own server.

I have followed numerous guides, and videos. I understand that you need to Download the source and client, change the Ip, extract, fix the name of the server, Etc. Once i follow everything, it still doesnt run or work ( Errors pop up ).

If anybody wants to TV me or even just help, i would be very grateful.


Its gonna be fun being apart of the Moparscape community.

(N)eon.

<p>(Edited)- 8 views later and no comments… someone please help me?[/quote] You have to downloah the source and client, extract, change the ip, edit it, portforward, change java versions to your own. It’s actually quite easy. If you need help, add me on msn: <a href="mailto:x-x-box@hotmail.com">x-x-box@hotmail.com</a></p>
