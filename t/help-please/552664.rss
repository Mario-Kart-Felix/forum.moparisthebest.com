    <description>I am a new coder but want to make a server, idc what version, i just want a server to base out of varrock bank with pvp outside of it, get random drops and type ::sellinv to get cash for the random items, so the gold could be used to buy better weapons and armour such as AGS, claws, etc. i could either take a source and code random pvp drops into it, or i was wondering if somebody already had this that could help me code it or someone could give me theirs. Thanks</description>

              <p>We are not a spoonfeeding community. There are a few other ways you can look into getting what you want though. One way is to post a request in the Download Request section, somebody may know something similar to what youâ€™re looking for. Another way is to start a dev team. But without any effort of initiative you probably wont get any help.</p>
