    <description>I was wondering if anyone could help me setup a RSPS.

I have done this before but for some reason something is not right with what I am doing and I don&#39;t understand what, if you could come on teamviewer with me and help me setup, that would be great.

I already have all the cache/client/source ready and waiting in a folder.

<p>you will not learn by having someone do it for you. All the great programmers ( most of them ) have got to be where they are by research and dedication. Spoon feeding will not get you anywhere. If you just want to make yourself admin, i suggest donating 20 dollars to a bad server with 20% uptime.</p>

<p>Jumping to conclusion won’t get you anywhere either, I’m not using this RSPS for your average shits and giggles with a few people.<br>
This is a lot more complicated than you may think.</p>
