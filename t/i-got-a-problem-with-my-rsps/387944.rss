    <description>hello everyone,

i got a little problem with my RSPS. A few days ago me and my friend decided to make our own RSPS, i followed alot of guides online but it doesnt work and i dont know whats the problem is. Im dutch so i will try to do my best to speak english, i will explain all my steps with pictures and i hope you guys can find a thing i missed or something else so i can make my own RSPS. thank you for taking the time to read this.
[b]
1)[/b] i downloaded [b]WINRAR[/b], i dont need to show you guys a picture of that i think.

[b]2)[/b] i searched my own [b]source and client[/b] at moparscape fourms and extracted with winrar

[b]3)[/b] i download [b]JAVA JDK[/b] here is a picture of it (sorry but i dont really know how to add an picture so i did it by a site i created fastly, no worry there are NO VIRUSSEN of other things, i only want to make my own RSPS and i hope you guys can help me)

[url=http://members.webs.com/MembersB/editAppPage.jsp?app=photos&amp;path=%2Fphoto%2Fadd%3FfromInstall%3D1%26title%3DPhotos#photos/photo?photoid=121015125]http://members.webs.com/MembersB/editAppPage.jsp?app=photos&amp;path=%2Fphoto%2Fadd%3FfromInstall%3D1%26title%3DPhotos#photos/photo?photoid=121015125[/url]

[url=http://members.webs.com/MembersB/editAppPage.jsp?app=photos&amp;path=%2Fphoto%2Fadd%3FfromInstall%3D1%26title%3DPhotos#photos/photo?photoid=121015226]http://members.webs.com/MembersB/editAppPage.jsp?app=photos&amp;path=%2Fphoto%2Fadd%3FfromInstall%3D1%26title%3DPhotos#photos/photo?photoid=121015226[/url]

[b]4)[/b] i made an account on [b]no-ip [/b] and i added a host:


[url=http://members.webs.com/MembersB/editAppPage.jsp?app=photos&amp;path=%2Fphoto%2Fadd%3FfromInstall%3D1%26title%3DPhotos#photos/photo?photoid=121016694]http://members.webs.com/MembersB/editAppPage.jsp?app=photos&amp;path=%2Fphoto%2Fadd%3FfromInstall%3D1%26title%3DPhotos#photos/photo?photoid=121016694[/url]




i hope i made a mistake and i forgot to fill in any thing so thats the problem of my error



[b]5) [/b]  i download [b]no-ip duc[/b] and it looks like this:


[url=http://members.webs.com/MembersB/editAppPage.jsp?app=photos&amp;path=%2Fphoto%2Fadd%3FfromInstall%3D1%26title%3DPhotos#photos/photo?photoid=121016813]http://members.webs.com/MembersB/editAppPage.jsp?app=photos&amp;path=%2Fphoto%2Fadd%3FfromInstall%3D1%26title%3DPhotos#photos/photo?photoid=121016813[/url]

[b]6)[/b] i had to change [b]PATH[/b] AND [b]CLASSPATH[/b] like this:

PATH 

C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin;

CLASSPATH

CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin;%CLASSPATH%;


[b]7)[/b] some guides say that i have to dowload [b]qTORRENT[/b] i also did that and i filled in:

[url=http://members.webs.com/MembersB/editAppPage.jsp?app=photos&amp;path=%2Fphoto%2Fadd%3FfromInstall%3D1%26title%3DPhotos#photos/photo?photoid=121017297]http://members.webs.com/MembersB/editAppPage.jsp?app=photos&amp;path=%2Fphoto%2Fadd%3FfromInstall%3D1%26title%3DPhotos#photos/photo?photoid=121017297[/url]
