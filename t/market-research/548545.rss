    <description>Hello, I&#39;ve played Runescape for a very long time on and off. Runescape being the official version and private servers. I&#39;ve owned private servers in the past but this time I&#39;m looking to make something absolutely brilliant.

So I have one first question to ask and it would be greatly appreciated if you could answer it honestly in order to help me with my project.

I was planning on starting out running the server myself, here&#39;s my [u]computers spec[/u]...

[b]Processor - Intel Core i7-4790k CPU 4.00GHz
RAM - 16.0 GB
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970
HDD - 1TB WD Black
SSD - 840 EVO 250 GB[/b]

[u]Internet test...[/u]

[b]Download Speed - 16 Mbps
Upload Speed - 1.7 Mbps[/b]

Based on an average 317 server, how many players should I expect to be able to hold without lag?


By the way I&#39;m looking for a top notch team to join me in making this server. If you think you&#39;ve got what it takes then private message me on here or leave a comment. You may well be rewarded, Thank you.</description>

<p>Fair enough, once again I thank you Matzie.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have any idea of how many players this computer could roughly hold on a 317 and maybe even higher?</p>

              <p>A lot of programmers run into the issue of implementation bottlenecks, not execution. The way the network traffic and game processes are handles is going to be your greatest nemesis.<br>
Also note the access rate on your HDD may slow you down, you can easily bottleneck if there are a lot of (dis)connections simultaneously(game load/save). The more players, the higher chance of this.</p>
<p>As far as network traffic goes, i have no clue as to a cap on what to expect on per player basis. As players rise, so will the traffic per player (Live sync for player displays). This will also be part with your implementation (Old 317s felt the need to send a interface update on every game tick, lot of wasted bandwidth there)</p>
<p>Also having your server on the same host as your gamesaves can help with latency, but also prevents your growth and adds more vulnerabilities. A servers only purpose should be the performance of what it is hosting(Ergo, your RSPS), having the server ask a database for player data will help you in the long run for larger and more versatile scalability, maintainability and modifications.</p>
<p>Good luck on your endeavor!</p>

              <p>First of all, thank you for your reply. All the feedback I get here is extremely valuable.</p>
<p>Yes it’s my personal computer, I was thinking of starting with it to keep costs down and then later on I was planning on buying a VPS server to host it once it’s clear I need to upgrade.</p>
<p>Also I’m using HomePlugs for my connection hence the slow upload speed, they’re top of the range though and the wiring in my house seems to be efficient as it’s a reasonably new house.</p>
<p>Lastly, if anyone else has any view on the amount of players I should be able to hold that would be great! The more the merrier as they say!</p>

<p>Is that a personal computer? If it’s meant to be only a server, you don’t need a graphics card or SSD really. In my experience though, the processor and RAM you have should be able to hold a pretty good amount of players online with minimal lag (&gt; 200). Now, whether or not you actually get the many players is a different problem. What I would do is, as the number of players increases, open up a profiler, and see where any bottlenecks in the code are. Also, the upload speed seems a bit low.</p>
