    <title>Mounts?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mounts/398166</link>
    <description>This is just one of my latest curiousities. Also i appologize if this is the wrong section, its been a few years since my last project. To the matter at hand though.

I Am wondering how to add mountable non aggressive-Npc&#39;s that can be summoned by a button. I have seen this done but it appears all that was changed was the height to appear as floating on a dragon. I am looking for more WOW type mounts, as in increase of speed. I would really appretiate any help given.

Yes I did look for a good explanation on this before i posted.</description>

<p>No. But it would be incredibly difficult, seeing as the models take up one tile. Adding mounts would change the character space to two tiles. And since the map is handled with an integral system, you can’t do anything like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">player.setLocation(3200.5, 3200.5, 0);</code></pre>

              <p>You’d need to create some custom animations, and a lot more to get this to work. However, I know in 508 (maybe an earlier revision as well) there are mountable gnome copters (they were used for tutorials in real runescape), but they’re actually just equipment you put on, then you can change your players walk animations so that they are flying in it.</p>
