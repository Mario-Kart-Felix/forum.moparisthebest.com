    <title>[Release] Open source, Horribly Written 2D RPG skeleton</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/release-open-source-horribly-written-2d-rpg-skeleton/543389</link>
    <description>http://www.mediafire.com/download/3cbvclw9m9ex33w/JGame.zip

Absolutely horribly written 2D game I was working on.

According to the project thread, here is a list of what I&#39;ve done:

Terrain
Easy Terrain Making/Editing
Player Moves to where you click like RuneScape
Strings displaying Health and Level on screen (why did I even add this hahahaha)
Ability to change movement speed (durr)
GameObject Managing
Scrolling Camera
Animated walking (needs work on sprites)


In Progress:

Object collision
Right Click Drop Down Menu with Options


Not Done (Todo list):


Object Interaction
Items
Equipment
GUI (inventory, etc)
Combat
NPC&#39;s

It was practically my first Java project I ever did. It was going nowhere so I released it.</p>

<p>As for documentation, here is an example:</p>

<p>As for documentation, here is an example:</p>
<p>[code=java]/**</p>
<ul>
<li>{explanation here}<br>
*/<br>
void someMethod() {<br>
…<br>
}[/code]</li>
</ul>
<p>The great thing about it is, it can get really detailed and you can use little generators to auto-generate your docs into a web file for you!</p>
