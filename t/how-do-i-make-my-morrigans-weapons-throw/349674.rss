    <title>How do I make my Morrigans weapons throw?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-my-morrigans-weapons-throw/349674</link>
    <description>Hey I just wonderd how do I like get my Morrigans Java/Throwing axe to work? because at the moment it doesn&#39;t throw and its classed as a Mele weapon. 

My base source is Delta.

Also How do I make it so I can increase the damage/rate of an NPC/Monster

Also on our source I made a stoor for donations (Made it with cash amounts of 2 Bill) so people don&#39;t buy It I couldn&#39;t get working donation shops for points, it was buggy as heck.. Now people are Alching items that are in the stoor and selling them to the stoor for Mass amounts, any idea how I can Modify this? :) Thanks :)</description>
