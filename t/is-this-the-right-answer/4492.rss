    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-the-right-answer/4492</link>
    <description>i gave my cousin my password and he sent a pmod request, so i told jagex the truth, and asked if this would ruin my chances of being a pmod and they replied with this and they replied with this.

Thank you very much for your interest or for your recommendation, gentle traveller.

Can I be a Player Mod?

Player moderators are trusted players of RuneScape that have the ability to send priority reports about rule breaking players. 

They use the report abuse feature to make Jagex staff aware of rule breakers, in the same way as players. You can recognise one if you see a silver crown icon next to their name in the chat area when they speak.

They do NOT receive items, skills or gold pieces, they cannot ban another player, and they cannot get another player banned without evidence of rule breaking. 
They also do NOT receive free membership.

Player moderators are hand picked by Jagex staff only, and are notified exclusively via an inbox message. Player will NOT be contacted in game if they are selected or they won&#39;t receive any e-mail.

There are no formal requirements for a Mod, in terms of age or combat level, although they should be mature and experienced in Runescape. 

Also, previous punishments do not necessarily cancel out the ability to become a player moderator. We do take into account the time at which offenses took place and if we feel that a player has redeemed themselves and has made themselves worthy of the role, then any previous issues can be seen past.

The best way to maximise your chances of being asked to become a Player Mod is to carry on playing the game in accordance with the rules, sending in good
Abuse Reports, and being helpful &amp; friendly to other players who are less experienced than yourself. 

Keep doing this and the chances of you being selected for consideration as a Player Moderator will be improved massively!

There needs to be more Mods

We are carrying out an ongoing campaign to recruit more player mods. Hopefully you will be able to see the results of this soon in the greater number of Mods that you will come across.

A player said they were a Mod and could Ban my account, is this true?

A silver crown icon will appear next to their name in the chat area when they speak, if this does not show then the player is not a Mod. Player Mods cannot ban accounts but do have the power to Mute an account. Jagex will never ask for your Password.

How can I tell the difference between a Jagex Mod and a Player Mod?

Jagex Mods have a Gold crown whilst Player Mods have a silver crown.

Can I be a Forum Mod?

Forum Moderators are normal players, not employees, who have been hand picked by Jagex after they have managed to prove consistently that they have the skills and experience needed for helping us monitor fairness in the forums.

The best way to maximise your chances of being asked to become a Forum Moderator is to carry on posting in the forums in accordance with the rules, and being helpful &amp; friendly to other players who are less experienced than yourself. 
We would also expect any future Forum Moderators to be able to express their opinions clearly.

Keep doing this and the chances of you being selected for consideration as a Forum Moderator will be improved massively.

We hope you find our player mods useful in the game and thank you for your positive comments regarding our player moderators.

Sincerely,
RuneScape Customer Support

<p>The way to become a player mod is to never break the rules and send in alot of abuse reports.</p>
