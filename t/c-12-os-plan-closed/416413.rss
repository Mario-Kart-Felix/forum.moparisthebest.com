    <title>C-12 OS Plan - Closed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-12-os-plan-closed/416413</link>
    <description>Many of you probably don&#39;t remember me, I did private servers for a while... Eventually got bored and did simple J-apps for runescape example as a GE price checker ETC.

But I&#39;ve decided to do one last server, I know its been months since I was last on here but I want to create C-12.

My aim is to create an average skilling / pking server. 
Fact is though, only 317 client content. No new models animation or obs.
I want to leave the client untouched.

Now my plan is to create a perfect combat formula, and because I&#39;ve never really been the best with that... I&#39;m asking someone to step forward and help out.

This project will not have constant updates, once its finished it will be released. Unless who ever is working with me wants to host it.

Now think back into 2007. &#39;The good old days&#39; as we call them, whip to g maul? 20 def init pures? Blitzing level 50s? I want to recreate that fantastic gameplay in a server economy.
So basically easy teleports ETC. And stocked shops, but with the amazing pking feel. I&#39;ll have to think about torso and rune def and even maybe skillcapes / godswords before I do anything.

But yes, thats my plan not sure if I should do a 420 though, so please leave suggestions on whether it should be a typical 317 or 420.
And also suggestions on the networking, I was thinking on using Canownueasy&#39;s Xera Me. It has a good reputation of being stable.

Thanks, Lex.

C-12 has started, just look out for it :).</description>
