    <title>What does this mean?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-does-this-mean/466187</link>
    <description>Now I&#39;m wondering what people mean when they say something like this when they are showing off their sever
The title says its a 317 
yet in the description about it, it says it has something like [color=orange]gfx 602 npc 402[/color] and crap like that and they have graphics and npc models that makes a 317 look worst?
i really wonder what they mean by that and would like to to know how to do something like that.</description>

<p>Most servers these days use the 317 protocol, but have the client load data from a higher revision. Still a 317 server, but higher data.</p>

If it says something like “[317] 602 models, 525 maps.” That means it’s loading the server with a 317 format, with models and maps that have been added to the specific revisions. 317’s are typically what you want to start coding with. Delta would be ideal to start with, but you can’t doo TOO much with it. Pi would be the next step, then you move to whatever revision you would like. You can start anywhere, this is just so you can get the feel for coding. Just remember that with each base change, there are different coding patterns and formats.<br>
[/quote]If you want to actually learn to program dont even bother with delta or PI, use hyperion or something thats not a pile of shit.[/quote]I disagree. I started programming with C++ and shortly moved to using wL servers like CheezScape 80 shortly after. I recommend starting with wL servers because most of the code is there to actually do something obvious, vs having a lot of management and optimizations. It’s a better way to understand programming.</p>

              <p>FroyoScape’s intro:</p>
<p>People seem to have lost the point in RSPS. Watch servers like Deathlypvpz, whose coders think they are the best.<br>
Who seem to have lost the point in RSPS.<br>
We all started from us trying to add new items, that was, in my opinion, the Old Stone Age, we just tried to add Dragon Claws, eventually we got it, bcp, we got it, but when it all happened, our trend looked upon older items again.<br>
And this cycle will continue.<br>
When we finally programmed all the new RS features (Hybrid PvP started this), it became the New Stone Age.<br>
However, we started to look upon our old items, the good feeling of successfully programming simple things.<br>
We thought to ourselves, “We made our RSPS just like RS! Now what? Uhh…”<br>
You just cannot think of anything due to you just copying RS.<br>
Same updates as RS.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">For the servers that think that new things are awesome and program them, tell me this.<br>
Why should we play your server whereas RS has the same features but with the full features. </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">We are fully benefiting from RS if we copy, whereas, we should use our own ideas. </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Andrew Gower wasn’t born with these ideas, he made them up.<br>
That’s how RS came to be.<br>
That’s the RS we know now and use to love.<br>
That’s the RS that got known world-wide and turned to a master piece by Jagex. </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">If they thought of there own ideas, we should. </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">We should make a new RS, a new RS with our own RSPS features.<br>
We should make anything our mind gravitates towards.<br>
We have the power in our brain’s creativity to make a world-wide known RSPS. </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Just only if we try. Do you think us programmers were made just to copy? No, we were made to build upon and make a better game.</span></p>
<p>Why you shouldn’t put 602 junk.</p>
