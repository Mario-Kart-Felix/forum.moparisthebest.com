    <title>What does this mean?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-does-this-mean/68353</link>
    <description>Okay, well I downloaded the Xlinepk test client, and I went to run it and this message popped up.
[code]
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: client
Press any key to continue . . .
[/code]

Which, I have seen this message before, and I have always figured that there was something wrong with the client. So I asked the owner, Bluurr, what was causing this. He said that I needed 1.6.0, which I have, and then he said that I needed to install in, which I did like a month ago.

So, could someone tell me how to fix this error?
