    <description>i geuss my server us pulling a nullpointerexeption i searched for nullpointerexeption in my client.java and heres what i found 

			// login response - 0 means exchange session key to establish encryption
			// Note that we could use 2 right away to skip the cryption part, but i think this
			// won&#39;t work in one case when the cryptor class is not set and will throw a NullPointerException
			out.write(0);

here it is in code format if that is better for you
[code]			// login response - 0 means exchange session key to establish encryption
			// Note that we could use 2 right away to skip the cryption part, but i think this
			// won&#39;t work in one case when the cryptor class is not set and will throw a NullPointerException
			out.write(0);[/code]

what does this mean i dont know what to do it loggs every1 off my server and they cant logg back in my runserver.bat says something about a nullpointerexeption and then it says serbscape - [fatal] error

the fatal part scares me</description>
