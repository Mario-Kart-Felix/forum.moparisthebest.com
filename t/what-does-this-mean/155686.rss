    <description>in the tutoria section this is cahpter 5 of making a server and it doesn&#39;t really make since, can anyone tell me what to do?:


Open Network &amp; Internet Connections. Right click on the connection you&#39;re using to connect to the internet and click properties. Open the Advanced tab and click on firewall settings. Open the Exceptions tab and at the bottom you should see a button &quot;Add Port&quot;.
Click on it, and add your server name or whatever you want it to be at the Name field.
At the Port number fill in 43594.
And make sure the TCP box has been checked.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Open Network &amp; Internet Connections - this is found in your control panel</p>
<p>Right click on the connection you’re using to connect to the internet and click properties.- this is in that wich will have a few connections like local area conection and test ect… you want the one wich has the numbers before it eg.1232 connection". And right click that n propertys at botom or drop down thingy.</p>
<p>Open the Advanced tab and click on firewall settings. - the advanced tab is in the propertys wich u clicked on and the firewall settings will be there.</p>
<p>Open the Exceptions tab and at the bottom you should see a button “Add Port”.- you should see the tab as said in the tutorial and just do as it says.(basicly your adding a new port specificly for your server i think)</p>
<p>Click on it, and add your server name or whatever you want it to be at the Name field.-do as said pretty straight forward<br>
At the Port number fill in 43594.-straight forward just follow<br>
And make sure the TCP box has been checked.-straight forward just follow not hard.</p>
<p>and then thats that<br>
Youve now basicly added a new port wich will work specificly for your server i think.<br>
hope i helped in a small way</p>
<p>what he said lmao i dno i tried lol</p>
