<p>Christians should support such a society, with mostly gay sex there would be no unwanted pregnancy and thus less abortions. Homosexuality just gets more and more acceptable and will soon be more acceptable than heterosexually.</p>

              <p>It would be entirely impossible for nature to take that course considering that breeding would come first and seem natural. Male and female have their genital parts for a reason and yes it is (by nature alone) considered unnatural to be homosexual. I feel that if being homosexual was normal, well then being heterosexual would be just as normal or an equal for the simple fact that breeding is one of the most important things in nature, for all creatures.</p>

“What if” can go on for centuries and you still would have things to question beginning with “what if”.<br>
What if humans were a-sexual<br>
What if we were more intelligent creatures<br>
What if we had 4 eyes<br>
What if everyone had a second mouth<br>
What if women didn’t exist<br>
What if women were the dominate gender<br>
[size=1pt]what if women had rights?[/size]</p>
<p>I’ve seen this before, and I don’t think that could be possible unless someone created a only-homosexual society that was cut off from the rest of civilization for hundreds of years until straight people were basically a legend to them and were considered bad.<br>
Which wouldn’t be possible because how would they conceive children (Inb4 someone says sperm banks or artificial insemination).<br>
Being gay has rapidly become more socially acceptable than ever before, but society still needs time to change because the older generations still have their values and beliefs heavily tied into the system.<br>
[/quote]Wow wow women having rights, calm down.</p>
<p>But the what if was to that video, what is hetrosexual was bad and homosexual was normal? With breeding seasons as stated in this video.[/quote]<br>
I’ve seen the video float around a few times. I never watched the entire thing nor do I plan to.</p>
