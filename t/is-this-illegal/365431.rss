    <title>Is this illegal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-illegal/365431</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s a little background, I&#39;m taking Chinese as an elective at my high school, and we recently got a new teacher named, Let&#39;s say Mrs. Chen. Mrs. Chen was a former chinese tour guide, immigrated to the U.S., she&#39;s pursuing a teaching degree at an american university and at the same time teaching at our highschool.

She&#39;s extremely unfair, and the last average on our Chinese test was about 40%, now you know there&#39;s something wrong, because the people who take chinese in the first place are extremely bright people, people who want a challenge. I conducted a survey and the average studying was 3-6 hours a night the days before the test. That should be more than enough to ace a test for an elective.

She gave us a lecture how its the classes fault that everyone failed not hers, so &quot;NO RETAKE&quot;.

Then immediately the next day we get an opportunity to get 25 extra credit points thats enough at this point in the semester to get from a D to an A, easy. Of course everyone signs up. 

Myself and a few other students start getting suspicious when she wants us to sign this consent form, saying that we understand the &quot;minimal risk&quot; involved in taking part in her &quot;study&quot; for her &quot;thesis&quot;. Now I&#39;m like hey, this wasn&#39;t part of the deal, then I read deeper into the fine print. And its specifically a thesis on how Asian Americans cooperate in groups when solving a problem.

The first dilemma arises, if this thesis is only supposed to be for Asian Americans, isn&#39;t that discrimination? Also when we signed the consent form we had to clearly state our ethnicity and take a survey on &quot;cooperation&quot;. However all white/latinos/blacks are obviously encourage to join, but I&#39;m assuming they won&#39;t have an constructive part in the survey, because it clearly states her thesis is soley based on Asian Americans. She probably just offered that to not offend people.

The first day, we&#39;re put into groups of 5 and we&#39;re treated like lab rats she has a recorder on each table to get every single word we say. Then she gives us a complicated algebraic equation in chinese and asks us to work together to solve it then give a presentation.

My problem is that there were a few disputes during the course of solving the problem and I&#39;m curious whether this will affect her paper, I don&#39;t want her saying something like &quot;Asian Americans are aggressive when working in groups and are always trying to dominate because of their culture&quot;.

Second of all isn&#39;t this illegal, it&#39;s a conflict of interest, she offers extra credit points to people who will be her guinea pigs on a racially stereotypical study. We&#39;re just high school students, and for all we know shes trying to see how long it takes a group of chinese-americans to solve a math problem that took a chinese 3rd grader 5 minutes.

The consent forms and all that are just creeping me out, I conducted another survey between fellow members of her experimental group and like me we were all pressured into joining the group because we felt there was no other way to maintain an A in the class,  even though we all worked 8 hours a day we would still fail the tests.

I don&#39;t know what do to, it&#39;s pretty racist even from the start assuming that asian kids communicate/cooperate differently than white kids, we&#39;re all mostly ABC (American Born Chinese). This teacher is like new to the U.S. and she doesn&#39;t understand we consider ourselves american too.</description>

<blockquote>Racism is the belief that the genetic factors which constitute race are a primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.[1] Racism's effects are called "racial discrimination." In the case of institutional racism, certain racial groups may be denied rights or benefits, or receive preferential treatment.</blockquote>

              <p>Here’s a little background, I’m taking Chinese as an elective at my high school, and we recently got a new teacher named, Let’s say Mrs. Chen. Mrs. Chen was a former chinese tour guide, immigrated to the U.S., she’s pursuing a teaching degree at an american university and at the same time teaching at our highschool.</p>
<p>She’s extremely unfair, and the last average on our Chinese test was about 40%, now you know there’s something wrong, because the people who take chinese in the first place are extremely bright people, people who want a challenge. I conducted a survey and the average studying was 3-6 hours a night the days before the test. That should be more than enough to ace a test for an elective.</p>
<p>She gave us a lecture how its the classes fault that everyone failed not hers, so “NO RETAKE”.</p>
<p>Then immediately the next day we get an opportunity to get 25 extra credit points thats enough at this point in the semester to get from a D to an A, easy. Of course everyone signs up.</p>
<p>Myself and a few other students start getting suspicious when she wants us to sign this consent form, saying that we understand the “minimal risk” involved in taking part in her “study” for her “thesis”. Now I’m like hey, this wasn’t part of the deal, then I read deeper into the fine print. And its specifically a thesis on how Asian Americans cooperate in groups when solving a problem.</p>
<p>The first dilemma arises, if this thesis is only supposed to be for Asian Americans, isn’t that discrimination? Also when we signed the consent form we had to clearly state our ethnicity and take a survey on “cooperation”. However all white/latinos/blacks are obviously encourage to join, but I’m assuming they won’t have an constructive part in the survey, because it clearly states her thesis is soley based on Asian Americans. She probably just offered that to not offend people.</p>
<p>The first day, we’re put into groups of 5 and we’re treated like lab rats she has a recorder on each table to get every single word we say. Then she gives us a complicated algebraic equation in chinese and asks us to work together to solve it then give a presentation.</p>
<p>My problem is that there were a few disputes during the course of solving the problem and I’m curious whether this will affect her paper, I don’t want her saying something like “Asian Americans are aggressive when working in groups and are always trying to dominate because of their culture”.</p>
<p>Second of all isn’t this illegal, it’s a conflict of interest, she offers extra credit points to people who will be her guinea pigs on a racially stereotypical study. We’re just high school students, and for all we know shes trying to see how long it takes a group of chinese-americans to solve a math problem that took a chinese 3rd grader 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The consent forms and all that are just creeping me out, I conducted another survey between fellow members of her experimental group and like me we were all pressured into joining the group because we felt there was no other way to maintain an A in the class,  even though we all worked 8 hours a day we would still fail the tests.</p>
<p>I don’t know what do to, it’s pretty racist even from the start assuming that asian kids communicate/cooperate differently than white kids, we’re all mostly ABC (American Born Chinese). This teacher is like new to the U.S. and she doesn’t understand we consider ourselves american too.</p>
