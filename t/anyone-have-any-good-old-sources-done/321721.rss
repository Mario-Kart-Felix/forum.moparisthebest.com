    <title>Anyone have any good old sources? [DONE]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-have-any-good-old-sources-done/321721</link>
    <description>I have tried lookin around for any good old sources that were sort of built of up and just needed there final touches but cant find any. I dont mind if you just drop a name and I&#39;ll try and find a download for it. Any help appreciated :D

[b][u]KIND OF SERVER IM LOOOKING FOR[/u][/b]
A good PK server that was set in Varock but with everything as PK and only safe zones were bank and Dummies.

[b][u]WHY?[/u][/b]
I plan on editing one until i have fixed all the bug and made up to to modern standards :D

[b][u]WHAT IM NOT LOOKING FOR[/u][/b]
A really old one like Pimpscape PK or like sources from the stone ages ones that were kind of built and set but just never got there in the end.

[b]Thanks In Advance.[/b]</description>
