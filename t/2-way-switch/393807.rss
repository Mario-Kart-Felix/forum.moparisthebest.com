    <title>2-way switch?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-way-switch/393807</link>
    <description>I know there are nearly endless possibilities that are able to be made via redstone and such, but this one I cannot seem to figure it out. Here is a basic diagram of how it would work in the house. Color&#39;s on the wire are incorrect, but not needed for redstone anyways. Basically, each switch much be in the same mode (up or down) in order for the lightbulb (gray thingy) to actually turn on. This concept is applied to many stair-ways in houses for the light, so the person can turn it on and off from the top or bottom. I am wondering if this is possible for an lightstone torch or door to be turned on/open off/closed.

EDIT: I looked at some diagrams on the Wiki a person on MSN just messaged me, and it wasn&#39;t what I was looking for. I think this will endup requiring some more advanced circuitry than whats around.</description>
