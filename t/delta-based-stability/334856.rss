    <description>Hello,

I was just wondering where abouts in the server files the main problems occur which mkae the server lagg. I realise that the code of delta is not written that well and this doesnt help, but i was thinking of trying to improve certain parts of the stability. I think the process has something to do with the stability, but would anybody help me please ?

Thanks for reading.</description>
