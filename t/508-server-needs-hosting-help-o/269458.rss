    <title>[508] Server needs hosting HELP :O</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-server-needs-hosting-help-o/269458</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I was just wondering if there were any useful tutorials of hosting 508&#39;s or any ways to get specific help. I realize it has many of the same concepts of hosting a 317 which I have done but I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m doing wrong.

I have hamachi, it works fine, and I can play on my server alone with the hamachi ip

I can run on local host

I have my server inside the .titana cache

I can edit and produce a modified base server and I can run it with my client

What I&#39;m trying to do here is host it myself, The client for the 508 servers is the only thing you need to download right if you were trying to play on that hosted server + you would be able to connect to the ip and ports aswell. I have edited my router so it will allow for the gaming ports and the client and server match those ports aswell as ham but anyone that tries to connect will get an error javascript5 message, and it will not load past connecting to update server.

I would be really grateful if anyone could aim me in the right direction or help me get this done.</description>

              <p>I don’t believe it was the ports -.- still can’t get it working. It might be with the client, I heard that I have to go into client.java and edit the ip that it takes it from and take it from 127.0.0.1 to the hamachi ip.</p>
<p>My friend is also trying to download the server files but everytime he tries to extract it to the .titana cache he will get this error <img src="http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2843/seek.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
