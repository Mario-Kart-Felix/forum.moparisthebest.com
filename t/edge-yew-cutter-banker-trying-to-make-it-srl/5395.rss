    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/edge-yew-cutter-banker-trying-to-make-it-srl/5395</link>
    <description>hi ppl i posted it already in the wrong section;
i&#39;m trying to srlize this old script made by realrune becaue i think it worth it.
i have to finish clean it from all unuseful parts and but right now is working (just bank procedure must be fixed and updated)
if you know a fastr way to do that would be awesome :)
btw i learnt alot trying to understand the script. i&#39;m also trying to make my own (with less code and entirely based on srl procedures functions and what else)
i&#39;m also not good in english so be patient ;)
tnx</description>

              <p>The fatsest way to find a bank when you are inside the bank is <span class="bbcode-b">OpenBankQueit(‘eb’);</span> That will open edgeville bank. It’s a bit laggy, but it works great.</p>
<p>I think that was the problem you were trying to get across? :\</p>
<p>I hope I helped!</p>
