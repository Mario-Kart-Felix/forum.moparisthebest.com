    <title>Why cant people login my server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-cant-people-login-my-server/301276</link>
    <description>I have portforwarded and I set my ip and all of that but, my problem is that when people click the login button they dont login but
their account has been created. I figure that they must be logging in and then it makes them disconnect. I can see their ip and their username
and all of that when they login but it seems they are not on the server.
I have no-ip and java and all the stuff i need in the tutorial.
the only problem is some people can create an account but not be on.
My friend tried logging on but it doesnt show that he tried to login and his account hasn&#39;t been created kinda weird.
Runelocus and Mopar status checker says that my server is online when i register it.
Can someone please give me tips or hints on what is wrong? 
I need serious help
Thank You!</description>

<p>see what happens when you disable our firewall and if you have antivirus firewall disable that too. but first, to check if it is a problem with your server or your configuration, download another server dont edit it or anythign just run it and see if people can log on. if they can log on then something is wrong with your old server. if they cant log on then something is wrong with your firewall or port forwarding configuration.</p>
