    <title>Mac, client running problems. Rep if applicable</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mac-client-running-problems-rep-if-applicable/363400</link>
    <description>Hey,

I just decided to have a little look on a private server via webclient. It downloaded the cache, and then came up with that black screen saying &quot;Sorry, an error has occurred whilst running runescape, please try one of the following...&quot;

I then downloaded the client and had the same problem.

Any suggestions?

Thanks
