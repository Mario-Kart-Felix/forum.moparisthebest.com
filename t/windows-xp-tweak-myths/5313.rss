These are windows tweak that dont work. but most of the tweaking apps have these tweaks. So get ready

Myth - &quot;Windows XP requires a high end PC to install and run&quot;

Reality - &quot;Windows XP can be installed on surprisingly low system requirements contrary to popular opinion. With the average life cycle of a regular PC being roughly 4-6 years, just about any PC being used today can run Windows XP. The following requirements are Microsoft&#39;s &quot;official&quot; minimum system requirements which I have tested to work fine with the exception of only 64 MB of RAM (performance is poor). Increasing your RAM to 128 MB would be the only upgrade I would strongly consider as my absolute minimum Windows XP system requirements.&quot; - Source

233 MHz CPU (300 MHz Recommended) *
128 MB Recommended (64 MB of RAM minimum supported, may limit performance and some features) *
1.5 GB of available hard disk space *
Super VGA (800 x 600) or higher-resolution video adapter and monitor
CD-ROM or DVD drive
Keyboard and Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device

* Actual requirements will vary based on your system configuration and the applications and features you choose to install. Additional available hard disk space may be required if you are installing over a network.

Optimization Myths

Always Unload DLL Tweak

Myth - &quot;Enabling this frees up more memory and improves performance&quot;

Reality - &quot;Adding this Registry Key in Windows 2000 or XP has no effect since this registry key is no longer supported in Microsoft Windows 2000 or later. The Shell automatically unloads a DLL when its usage count is zero, but only after the DLL has not been used for a period of time. This inactive period might be unacceptably long at times, especially when a Shell extension DLL is being debugged. For operating systems prior to Windows 2000, you can shorten the inactive period by adding this registry key.&quot; - Source - Source 2

/Prefetch:1 Switch Tweak

Myth - &quot;Adding the /Prefetch:1 Switch to the startup path of a program&#39;s shortcut will decrease the program&#39;s startup time.&quot;

Reality - All it does is change your hash number - the OS is doing exactly the same thing it did before, and just saving the prefetch pages to a different file. It does not improve performance in any way. Ryan Myers of Microsoft&#39;s Windows Client Performance Team writes: &quot;The /prefetch:# flag is looked at by the OS when we create the process - however, it has one (and only one) purpose. We add the passed number to the hash. Why? WMP is a multipurpose application and may do many different things. The DLLs and code that it touches will be very different when playing a WMV than when playing a DVD, or when ripping a CD, or when listening to a Shoutcast stream, or any of the other things that WMP can do. If we only had one hash for WMP, then the prefetch would only be correct for one such use having incorrect prefetch data would not be a fatal error - it&#39;d just load pages into memory that&#39;d never get used, and then get swapped back out to disk as soon as possible. Still, it&#39;s counterproductive. By specifying a /prefetch:# flag with a different number for each &quot;mode&quot; that WMP can do, each mode gets its own separate hash file, and thus we properly prefetch. (This behavior isn&#39;t specific to WMP - it does the same for any app.) This flag is looked at when we create the first thread in the process, but it is not removed by CreateProcess from the command line, so any app that chokes on unrecognized command line parameters will not work with it. This is why so many people notice that Kazaa and other apps crash or otherwise refuse to start when it&#39;s added. Of course, WMP knows that it may be there, and just silently ignores its existence. I suspect that the &quot;add /prefetch:1 to make rocket go now&quot; urban legend will never die, though.&quot; - Source - Source 2

Cleaning the Prefetch Folder Tweak

Myth - &quot;Deleting the contents of the Prefetch folder improves performance&quot;

Reality - &quot;Every time you delete an application&#39;s Prefetch (.PF) file you will cripple that application&#39;s load time the next time you go to launch it. This can temporarily increase load times by as much as 100%. For one thing, XP will just re-create the Prefetch (.PF) files anyway; secondly, it trims the files if there&#39;s ever more than 128 of them so that it doesn&#39;t needlessly consume space. However you do not regain optimal application load times back until after the second time you launch the same application due to the Prefetch (.PF) file being re-created. Prefetch (.PF) files are not a cache and are not preloaded into memory upon windows startup. They are never even accessed until you launch an application. Only one Prefetch (.PF) file per application is created. There is never ANY reason to delete these files. Cleaning the Prefetch folder is actually a temporary self-inflicted unoptimization. Why you would want to deliberately hurt your PC&#39;s performance I have no idea.&quot; - Source

Warning - Recently CCleaner has added a performance slowing cleaning option, cleaning &quot;Old Prefetch Data&quot;. Cleaning the Prefetch folder is a Myth and actually hurts performance. Do not select this option for cleaning as it will increase application and Windows load times. I have contacted the makers of CCleaner unsuccessfully and have had subsequent topics brought up on their forums locked or deleted. For such a great program to turn a blind eye towards its users is unacceptable. I look forward to the makers of CCleaner to rectify this situation. - Source

EnablePrefetcher Tweak

Myth - &quot;Setting any Value higher then 3 to EnablePrefetcher will improve performance.&quot;

Reality - &quot;The Prefetcher component in Windows XP is part of the Memory Manager, and helps to shorten the amount of time it takes to start Windows and programs. You may want to disable this component for troubleshooting scenarios or in lab environments. The following list describes the different possible values for the EnablePrefetcher key. To disable Prefetch, set the Value to 0.

0 = Disabled
1 = Application launch prefetching enabled
2 = Boot prefetching enabled
3 = Applaunch and Boot enabled (Optimal and Default)

By default the Prefetcher is set to a Value of 3 in Windows XP. Values such as 4, 5, 6 ect... do not exist and are thus useless. Leave this at the default value of 3 which is already optimal for maximum performance.&quot; - Source

EnableSuperfetch Tweak

Myth - &quot;Enabling this improves performance in Windows XP as it does in Windows Vista.&quot;

Reality - &quot;This myth was started when the Inquirer irresponsibly ran a bogus letter without doing any fact checking. Windows internals guru Mark Russinovich said this won&#39;t work, the &quot;Superfetch&quot; string isn&#39;t even in the Windows XP kernel. You can confirm this yourself by checking with the strings.exe utility. This makes it impossible for it to do anything since no &quot;Superfetch&quot; command exists. Windows cannot execute a nonexistent command and will simply ignore it. Anyone who says this works is not only lying but a fool.&quot; - Source

Disabling the Pagefile

Myth - &quot;Disabling the Pagefile improves performance.&quot;

Reality - &quot;You gain no performance improvement by turning off the Pagefile. When certain applications start, they allocate a huge amount of memory (hundreds of megabytes typically set aside in virtual memory) even though they might not use it. If no Pagefile (i.e., virtual memory) is present, a memory-hogging application can quickly use a large chunk of RAM. Even worse, just a few such programs can bring a machine loaded with memory to a halt. Some applications (e.g., Adobe Photoshop) will display warnings on startup if no Pagefile is present.&quot; - Source

&quot;In modern operating systems, including Windows, application programs and many system processes always reference memory using virtual memory addresses which are automatically translated to real (RAM) addresses by the hardware. Only core parts of the operating system kernel bypass this address translation and use real memory addresses directly. All processes (e.g. application executables) running under 32 bit Windows gets virtual memory addresses (a Virtual Address Space) going from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2*32-1 = 4 GB), no matter how much RAM is actually installed on the computer. In the default Windows OS configuration, 2 GB of this virtual address space are designated for each process&#39; private use and the other 2 GB are shared between all processes and the operating system. RAM is a limited resource, whereas virtual memory is, for most practical purposes, unlimited. There can be a large number of processes each with its own 2 GB of private virtual address space. When the memory in use by all the existing processes exceeds the amount of RAM available, the operating system will move pages (4 KB pieces) of one or more virtual address spaces to the computer&#39;s hard disk, thus freeing that RAM frame for other uses. In Windows systems, these &quot;paged out&quot; pages are stored in one or more files called pagefile.sys in the root of a partition. Virtual Memory is always in use, even when the memory required by all running processes does not exceed the amount of RAM installed on the system.&quot; - Source

Disabling System Restore

Myth - &quot;Disabling System Restore improves performance.&quot;

Reality - &quot;System Restore does not cause any noticeable performance impact when monitoring your computer. The creation of a Restore point also is a very fast process and usually takes only a few seconds. Scheduled System Checkpoints (every 24 hours by default) are created only at system idle time to avoid interfering with a computer during use.&quot; - Source

FAT32 is better than NTFS

Myth - &quot;The FAT32 file system is better than NTFS.&quot;

Reality - &quot;NTFS is the better file system with many advantages over FAT32. NTFS features: Built-In Security, Recoverability, Alternate Streams, Custom File Attributes, Compression, Object Permissions, Economical Disk Space Usage using a more Efficient Cluster Size and Fault Tolerance. Windows 2000 and XP come with NTFS version 5 which includes even more advanced features such as: Encryption, Disk Quotas, Sparse Files, Reparse Points, Volume Mount Points. None of which is available with FAT32.&quot; - Comparison Chart

Performance
NTFS is built for speed with impressive disk I/O performance on large volumes (Over 400 MB). NTFS uses a binary tree structure for all disk directories, which reduces the number of times the system has to access the disk to locate files. This system is best for large directories, and NTFS easily outperforms FAT32 in these situations. In addition, NTFS automatically sorts files in a folder on the fly. NTFS gains an edge over FAT32 by using relatively small disk allocation units (cluster sizes) for NTFS volumes. Smaller clusters prevent wasted disk space on volumes, especially those with numerous small files. Because NTFS uses small clusters better and has a more efficient design, its performance doesn&#39;t degrade with large volumes, in contrast to FAT&#39;s. As the number of files and volume size increases NTFS performance is not effected but FAT32 continually gets worse. - Gaming Performance

Reliability
In addition to its extensive memory and application protection features, NTFS is a reliable file system. When storing data to disk, NTFS records file I/O events to a special transaction log. If the system crashes or encounters an interruption, NTFS can use this log to restore the volume and prevent corruption from an abnormal program termination or system shutdown. NTFS doesn&#39;t commit an action to disk until it verifies the successful completion of the action. This precaution helps prevent corruption of an NTFS volume. NTFS also supports hot-fixing disk sectors, where the OS automatically blocks out bad disk sectors and relocates data from these sectors. This housecleaning happens in the background. An application attempting to read or write data on a hot-fixed area will never know the disk had a problem. I only recommend and use NTFS with Windows 2000 and XP.&quot; - Source

L2 Cache Tweak

Alias - SecondLevelDataCache Tweak

Myth - &quot;Adjusting the SecondLevelDataCache Registry value to match your CPU&#39;s L2 Cache size improves performance.&quot;

Reality - &quot;If you do not set this registry value, Windows will use the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) for retrieval of the L2 cache size automatically on boot up. If this fails, a default value of 256KB is used. This is where the myth that XP can only use 256KB of L2 cache comes from. But it&#39;s false. The SecondLevelDataCache is designed as a secondary source of cache size information for computers on which the HAL cannot detect the L2 cache. The HAL is able to retrieve the L2 cache size from any CPU using the set-associative cache design (Pentium II or newer), it&#39;s only the relatively few older processors with direct-mapped L2 caches that the HAL will not recognize. This tweak only applies to older computers (Pentium I or older) with over 64 MB of memory. On these older systems, this tweak can improve performance by about 0.4%. Pentium II and later CPUs are not affected.&quot; - Source

IO Page Lock Limit Tweak

Myth - &quot;Increasing the IO Page Lock Limit will lock more memory for exclusive access by the kernel, improving performance&quot;

Reality - &quot;Indeed, it does do this but only in an RTM Windows 2000 machine. It does absolutely nothing in Windows 2000 Service Pack 1 and up, and absolutely nothing in Windows XP. This makes it effectively useless, since no one in their right minds would be running RTM Windows 2000. The RTM kernel references IoPageLockLimit. The SP1 kernel does not. Neither do any subsequent editions of the kernel; neither does the XP kernel in any of its incarnations.&quot; - Source

IRQ Priority Tweak

Myth - &quot;Adjusting the Priority of IRQs especially IRQ 8 improves system performance.&quot;

Reality - &quot;IRQs don&#39;t even HAVE a concept of &quot;priority&quot; in the NT family; they do have something called &quot;IRQL&quot; (interrupt request level) associated with them. But the interval timer interrupt is already assigned a higher IRQL than any I/O devices, second only to the inter-processor interrupt used in an MP machine. The NT family of OSes don&#39;t even use the real-time clock (IRQ Cool for time keeping in the first place! They use programmable interval timer (8254, on IRQ 0) for driving system time keeping, CPU time accounting, and so on. IRQ 8 is used for profiling, but profiling is almost never turned on except in very rare development environments. Even if it was possible it doesn&#39;t even make sense why adjusting the real-time clock priority would boost performance? The real-time clock is associated with time keeping not CPU frequency. I would not be surprised if this originated in an overclocking forum somewhere. This &quot;tweak&quot; can be found in most XP all-in-one tweaking applications. This is a perfect example of why they are not recommended.&quot; - Source

LargeSystemCache Tweak

Myth - &quot;Enabling this improves workstation performance.&quot;

Reality - &quot;LargeSystemCache determines whether the system maintains a standard size or a large size file system cache, and influences how often the system writes changed pages to disk. Increasing the size of the file system cache generally improves file server performance, but it reduces the physical memory space available to applications and services. Similarly, writing system data less frequently minimizes use of the disk subsystem, but the changed pages occupy memory that might otherwise be used by applications. On workstations this increases paging and causes longer delays whenever you start a new app. Simply put enable this on a file server and disable it on everything else.&quot; - Source

Moving the Pagefile

Continued on next post.......[br][size=1]Posted at: July 18, 2006, 02:17:32 PM[/size][hr]Myth - &quot;Moving the Pagefile to a different partition on the same drive improves performance.&quot;

Reality - &quot;Moving the Pagefile to a different partition on the same physical hard disk drive does not improve performance. Simply using a different partition on the same drive will result in lots more head-seeking activity, as the drive jumps between the Windows and page file partitions. Even though moving the pagefile in this case can have the positive effect of defragmenting it, the loss in I/O performance out weighs any gains. It is better to simply defragment the pagefile using PageDefrag and keep maximum I/O performance by leaving the pagefile where it is with a single drive setup. However you can enhance performance by putting the pagefile on a different partition and on a different physical hard disk drive. That way, Windows can handle multiple I/O requests more quickly. When the pagefile is on the boot partition, Windows must perform disk reading and writing requests on both the system folder and the pagefile. When the pagefile is moved to a different partition and a different physical hard disk drive, there is less competition between reading and writing requests.&quot; - Source

Notes - The only exception to this is if the Windows Operating System is not installed on the first physical partition of the disk. This would not be a default installation nor is it recommended.

NTFS is Fragmentation Free

Myth - &quot;The NTFS File system does not get fragmented and Defragmenters are unnecessary.&quot;

Reality - &quot;Even though NTFS is more resistant to fragmentation than FAT, it can and does still fragment. The reason NTFS is less prone to fragmentation is that it makes intelligent choices about where to store file data on the disk. NTFS reserves space for the expansion of the Master File Table, reducing fragmentation of its structures. In contrast to FAT&#39;s first-come, first-served method, NTFS&#39;s method of writing files minimizes, but does not eliminate, the problem of file fragmentation on NTFS volumes.&quot; - Source

QoS Tweak

Myth - &quot;Disabling QoS will free up the 20% bandwidth reserved by QoS&quot;

Reality - &quot;As in Windows 2000, programs can take advantage of QoS through the QoS APIs in Windows XP. 100% of the network bandwidth is available to be shared by all programs unless a program specifically requests priority bandwidth. This &quot;reserved&quot; bandwidth is still available to other programs unless the requesting program is sending data. By default, programs can reserve up to an aggregate bandwidth of 20% of the underlying link speed on each interface on an end computer. If the program that reserved the bandwidth is not sending sufficient data to use it, the unused part of the reserved bandwidth is available for other data flows on the same host.&quot; - Source

RAM Optimizers/Defragmenters

Myth - &quot;Increasing the amount of available RAM improves performance.&quot;

Reality - &quot;RAM Optimizers have no effect, and at worst, they seriously degrade performance. Although gaining more available memory might seem beneficial, it isn&#39;t. As RAM Optimizers force the available-memory counter up, they force other processes&#39; data and code out of memory. Say that you&#39;re running Word, for example. As the optimizer forces the available-memory counter up, the text of open documents and the program code that was part of Word&#39;s working set before the optimization (and was therefore present in physical memory) must be reread from disk as you continue to edit your document. The act of allocating, then freeing a large amount of virtual memory might, as a conceivable side effect, lead to blocks of contiguous available memory. However, because virtual memory masks the layout of physical memory from processes, processes can&#39;t directly benefit from having virtual memory backed by contiguous physical memory. As processes execute and undergo working-set trimming and growth, their virtual-memory-to-physical-memory mappings will become fragmented despite the availability of contiguous memory.&quot; - Source

Registry Cleaners

Myth - &quot;Registry Cleaners improve performance.&quot;

Reality - &quot;A few hundred kilobytes of unused keys and values causes no noticeable performance impact on system operation. Even if the registry was massively bloated there would be little impact on the performance of anything other than exhaustive searches. Registry Cleaners can fix problems associated with traces of applications left behind due to incomplete uninstalls. So it seems that Registry junk is a Windows fact of life and that Registry cleaners will continue to have a place in the anal-sysadmin&#39;s tool chest, at least until we&#39;re all running .NET applications that store their per-user settings in XML files - and then of course we&#39;ll need XML cleaners.&quot; - Source

Windows 95/98/ME vs XP Reliability

Myth - &quot;Windows 95/98/ME is as reliable as XP&quot; - Comparison Chart - Reliability Video

Reality - &quot;Windows XP is 10-30 times more reliable then Windows 95/98/ME. Windows XP Professional is built on the proven code base of Windows 2000, which features a 32-bit computing architecture, and a fully protected memory model. Windows XP offers several enhancements that make it the most reliable version of Windows yet: Application Compatibility, Compatibility Mode, Improved Device and Hardware Support, Shared DLL Support, Shutdown Event Tracker, Windows Driver Protection, Device Driver Rollback, Windows Installer, Auto Update, Dynamic Update, Windows Update, Shadow Copy Integration with Backup, Last Known Good Configuration, Automated System Recovery, System Restore Enhancements, Error Messaging and Product Support, Online Crash Analysis, &quot; - Source

Microsoft: Windows XP Reliability Study (PDF)
- Windows XP Professional ran over 30 times as long without encountering problems as those running Windows 98 SE.
- None of the Windows XP Professional systems had a single application or operating system failure during the test period.
- None of the Windows 2000 Professional Gold systems had a single application or operating system failure during the test period.

Security Myths



Limited User Accounts

Myth - &quot;Limited User Accounts are a Realistic Security Solution.&quot;

Reality - &quot;On a nonmanaged XP machine today, it isn&#39;t realistic to run without Administrator privileges. Unlike UNIX and UNIX-like systems such as Linux and Apple Computer&#39;s Mac OS X, Windows isn&#39;t very useable with a non-Administrator account, largely because so many applications are ignorant of rights and were written to work only with Administrator-level accounts. This is particularly problematic in a home environment, in which XP Home Edition&#39;s crippled Limited Account type, designed for children and less-technical users, is virtually useless. In Windows XP, the lame Run As option, virtually hidden under a right-click menu that typical users will never know about, is a poor substitute.&quot; - Source

&quot;After you log on to a computer by using a Limited User Account, you may observe one or more of the following behaviors when you try to use a program that is not expressly designed for Windows XP.

- The program does not run.
- The program stops responding (hangs).
- You receive notification of run-time error 7 or run-time error 3446.
- The program does not recognize that a CD-ROM is in the CD-ROM drive.
- The program does not allow you to save files.
- The program does not allow you to open files.
- The program does not allow you to edit files.
- The program displays a blank error message.
- You cannot remove the program.
- You cannot open the Help file.

This behavior can occur because the Limited User Account prevents older programs from performing certain functions. Microsoft lists over 189 applications in this article alone that do not work right on a Limited User Account.&quot; - Source

Hosts File

Myth - &quot;Special AntiSpyware Hosts Files are necessary to prevent Spyware infections.&quot;

Reality - &quot;Hosts Files are a waste of time and false security. Any Malware/Spyware can easily modify the Hosts File at will, even if it is set to Read-only. Frequently Malware/Spyware uses the Hosts File to redirect you Web Browser to other sites. CoolWebSearch hijackers are masters at altering Read-only (&quot;locked down&quot;) Hosts files. They can also redirect Windows to use a Hosts File that has nothing to do with the one you keep updating. The Hosts file is an archaic part of networking setups that was originally meant to be used on a LAN and was the legacy way to look up Domain Names on the ARPANET - DNS History. It tells a PC the fixed numeric address of the internal server(s) so the PC doesn&#39;t have to go looking for them through all possible addresses. It can save time when &quot;discovering&quot; a LAN. I don&#39;t consider 1970&#39;s ARPANET technology useful against modern Malware/Spyware. Special AntiSpyware Hosts Files attempt to associate a known safe, numeric address with the names of sites you want to block. When the user or any process on the PC then tries to access a blocked site, it is instead directed to the safe location. This works as long as the site&#39;s numeric IP address never changes. But IP addresses do change and they&#39;re supposed to be able to. The Web operates via &quot;dynamic&quot; naming, where a human friendly name (www.google.com) is actually an alias for the real address, which is numeric. The numeric address can and will change from time to time as a site or server is moved or reconfigured. People with out-of-date addresses hardwired into their Hosts File will no longer be able to connect to any site whose numeric address has changed. The Hosts entry will permanently point them to a dead location! It&#39;s almost impossible to update a Hosts file frequently enough to guard against all threats and even if you did, you&#39;d probably also run into problems in accidentally blocking good sites that happened to move to new numeric addresses. Large Hosts Files also cause Internet related slowdowns due to DNS Client Server Caching and disabling DNS Client Server Caching is not a solution. KB318803 &quot;The overall performance of the client computer decreases and the network traffic for DNS queries increases if the DNS resolver cache is deactivated.&quot; When cleaning Malware/Spyware from a PC, it is much easier to check a clean Hosts File then one filled with thousands of lines of addresses. Considering how easily a Hosts File can be exploited, redirected and potentially block good sites, it is strongly recommended NOT to waste time using Special Hosts Files. Especially when proper Malware/Spyware protection can be achieved by simply using these steps, all without ever using a Hosts File.&quot; - Source

Spyware, Malware and Virus Security

Myth - &quot;It is impossible or difficult to secure Windows XP from Spyware, Malware or Viruses.&quot;

Reality - &quot;It is very easy to secure Windows XP, simply use Secure XP - A Windows XP Security Guide. To put it bluntly I simply do not get infected with anything. Keep in mind nothing can fully protect you from something you manually install.&quot; - Source

Virus Hoaxes

Myth - &quot;All Email Virus warnings are real.&quot;

Reality - &quot;With the increase in the growth of viruses and Trojan programs, many computer users have turned to the Internet as a fast and easy tool to warn friends and co-workers of these threats. At the same time, there has also been a growth of virus hoax warnings. These warnings often describe fantastical or impossible virus or Trojan program characteristics, but appear to be real and forwarding these hoax warnings to friends and co-workers only perpetuates the problem. If you receive an Email that you suspect is a hoax, do not forward it to anyone and never open the attachments. Check in the Vmyths Hoax Database to confirm it is a hoax and delete the Email. If the Email originated from someone you know, send them an Email explaining the hoax.&quot; - Source

Vulnerabilities

Myth - &quot;Windows has more Security Vulnerabilities than Linux/Unix&quot;

Reality - &quot;Between January 2005 and December 2005 there were 5198 reported vulnerabilities: 812 Windows operating system vulnerabilities; 2328 Unix/Linux operating vulnerabilities; and 2058 Multiple operating system vulnerabilities&quot;</description>

<p>Disabling System Restore</p>
<p>When you’re doing system restores, it may be fast, but it adds more crap on your hard drive. I deleted all m restore points except for the very latest one and the very oldest one with some programs, and I looked at the file size, and it went from 10 gb to 8 gb. I was happy cause then I could backup my HDD on 2 DVDs than 3. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Spyware, Malware and Virus Security</p>
<p>lol this one is funny. It’s very very very hard to secure Windows. It’s possible, but even then it’s hard. To not be able to get spyware you would have to put a lot of limitations of your self such as no gaming (Easy to get hacked), no IE (firefox of course), have to get a firewall, have to have several spyware/adware preventors running in the background, security tweaks, blah blah a lot more. - I had these, configured these properly, and even I got spyware. :eek:</p>
<p>Okay this is so from Microsoft… Microsoft has so many fuckin security vulnerabilities lol. Okay up in till now I was believing some of these, but when you say that Microsoft has more security vulnerabilities than Linux/Unix, that is a fucking lie.</p>
<p>You know why only 812 OS vulnerabilities were only found in Microsoft within a year? It’s because everyone got reported most of the vulnerabilities before that, which Microsoft didn’t do shit about, cause they just have a shit OS.</p>

              <p>Credit to my friend That’sVJ</p>
<p>These are windows tweak that dont work. but most of the tweaking apps have these tweaks. So get ready</p>
<p>Myth - “Windows XP requires a high end PC to install and run”</p>
<p>Reality - “Windows XP can be installed on surprisingly low system requirements contrary to popular opinion. With the average life cycle of a regular PC being roughly 4-6 years, just about any PC being used today can run Windows XP. The following requirements are Microsoft’s “official” minimum system requirements which I have tested to work fine with the exception of only 64 MB of RAM (performance is poor). Increasing your RAM to 128 MB would be the only upgrade I would strongly consider as my absolute minimum Windows XP system requirements.” - Source</p>

Optimization Myths</li>
</ul>
<p>Always Unload DLL Tweak</p>
<p>Myth - “Enabling this frees up more memory and improves performance”</p>
<p>Reality - “Adding this Registry Key in Windows 2000 or XP has no effect since this registry key is no longer supported in Microsoft Windows 2000 or later. The Shell automatically unloads a DLL when its usage count is zero, but only after the DLL has not been used for a period of time. This inactive period might be unacceptably long at times, especially when a Shell extension DLL is being debugged. For operating systems prior to Windows 2000, you can shorten the inactive period by adding this registry key.” - Source - Source 2</p>
<p>/Prefetch:1 Switch Tweak</p>
<p>Myth - “Adding the /Prefetch:1 Switch to the startup path of a program’s shortcut will decrease the program’s startup time.”</p>
<p>Reality - All it does is change your hash number - the OS is doing exactly the same thing it did before, and just saving the prefetch pages to a different file. It does not improve performance in any way. Ryan Myers of Microsoft’s Windows Client Performance Team writes: “The /prefetch:# flag is looked at by the OS when we create the process - however, it has one (and only one) purpose. We add the passed number to the hash. Why? WMP is a multipurpose application and may do many different things. The DLLs and code that it touches will be very different when playing a WMV than when playing a DVD, or when ripping a CD, or when listening to a Shoutcast stream, or any of the other things that WMP can do. If we only had one hash for WMP, then the prefetch would only be correct for one such use having incorrect prefetch data would not be a fatal error - it’d just load pages into memory that’d never get used, and then get swapped back out to disk as soon as possible. Still, it’s counterproductive. By specifying a /prefetch:# flag with a different number for each “mode” that WMP can do, each mode gets its own separate hash file, and thus we properly prefetch. (This behavior isn’t specific to WMP - it does the same for any app.) This flag is looked at when we create the first thread in the process, but it is not removed by CreateProcess from the command line, so any app that chokes on unrecognized command line parameters will not work with it. This is why so many people notice that Kazaa and other apps crash or otherwise refuse to start when it’s added. Of course, WMP knows that it may be there, and just silently ignores its existence. I suspect that the “add /prefetch:1 to make rocket go now” urban legend will never die, though.” - Source - Source 2</p>
<p>Cleaning the Prefetch Folder Tweak</p>
<p>Myth - “Deleting the contents of the Prefetch folder improves performance”</p>
<p>Reality - “Every time you delete an application’s Prefetch (.PF) file you will cripple that application’s load time the next time you go to launch it. This can temporarily increase load times by as much as 100%. For one thing, XP will just re-create the Prefetch (.PF) files anyway; secondly, it trims the files if there’s ever more than 128 of them so that it doesn’t needlessly consume space. However you do not regain optimal application load times back until after the second time you launch the same application due to the Prefetch (.PF) file being re-created. Prefetch (.PF) files are not a cache and are not preloaded into memory upon windows startup. They are never even accessed until you launch an application. Only one Prefetch (.PF) file per application is created. There is never ANY reason to delete these files. Cleaning the Prefetch folder is actually a temporary self-inflicted unoptimization. Why you would want to deliberately hurt your PC’s performance I have no idea.” - Source</p>
<p>Warning - Recently CCleaner has added a performance slowing cleaning option, cleaning “Old Prefetch Data”. Cleaning the Prefetch folder is a Myth and actually hurts performance. Do not select this option for cleaning as it will increase application and Windows load times. I have contacted the makers of CCleaner unsuccessfully and have had subsequent topics brought up on their forums locked or deleted. For such a great program to turn a blind eye towards its users is unacceptable. I look forward to the makers of CCleaner to rectify this situation. - Source</p>
<p>EnablePrefetcher Tweak</p>
<p>Myth - “Setting any Value higher then 3 to EnablePrefetcher will improve performance.”</p>
<p>Reality - "The Prefetcher component in Windows XP is part of the Memory Manager, and helps to shorten the amount of time it takes to start Windows and programs. You may want to disable this component for troubleshooting scenarios or in lab environments. The following list describes the different possible values for the EnablePrefetcher key. To disable Prefetch, set the Value to 0.</p>
<p>0 = Disabled<br>
1 = Application launch prefetching enabled<br>
2 = Boot prefetching enabled<br>
3 = Applaunch and Boot enabled (Optimal and Default)</p>
<p>By default the Prefetcher is set to a Value of 3 in Windows XP. Values such as 4, 5, 6 ect… do not exist and are thus useless. Leave this at the default value of 3 which is already optimal for maximum performance." - Source</p>
<p>EnableSuperfetch Tweak</p>
<p>Myth - “Enabling this improves performance in Windows XP as it does in Windows Vista.”</p>
<p>Reality - “This myth was started when the Inquirer irresponsibly ran a bogus letter without doing any fact checking. Windows internals guru Mark Russinovich said this won’t work, the “Superfetch” string isn’t even in the Windows XP kernel. You can confirm this yourself by checking with the strings.exe utility. This makes it impossible for it to do anything since no “Superfetch” command exists. Windows cannot execute a nonexistent command and will simply ignore it. Anyone who says this works is not only lying but a fool.” - Source</p>
<p>Disabling the Pagefile</p>
<p>Myth - “Disabling the Pagefile improves performance.”</p>
<p>Reality - “You gain no performance improvement by turning off the Pagefile. When certain applications start, they allocate a huge amount of memory (hundreds of megabytes typically set aside in virtual memory) even though they might not use it. If no Pagefile (i.e., virtual memory) is present, a memory-hogging application can quickly use a large chunk of RAM. Even worse, just a few such programs can bring a machine loaded with memory to a halt. Some applications (e.g., Adobe Photoshop) will display warnings on startup if no Pagefile is present.” - Source</p>
<p>“In modern operating systems, including Windows, application programs and many system processes always reference memory using virtual memory addresses which are automatically translated to real (RAM) addresses by the hardware. Only core parts of the operating system kernel bypass this address translation and use real memory addresses directly. All processes (e.g. application executables) running under 32 bit Windows gets virtual memory addresses (a Virtual Address Space) going from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2*32-1 = 4 GB), no matter how much RAM is actually installed on the computer. In the default Windows OS configuration, 2 GB of this virtual address space are designated for each process’ private use and the other 2 GB are shared between all processes and the operating system. RAM is a limited resource, whereas virtual memory is, for most practical purposes, unlimited. There can be a large number of processes each with its own 2 GB of private virtual address space. When the memory in use by all the existing processes exceeds the amount of RAM available, the operating system will move pages (4 KB pieces) of one or more virtual address spaces to the computer’s hard disk, thus freeing that RAM frame for other uses. In Windows systems, these “paged out” pages are stored in one or more files called pagefile.sys in the root of a partition. Virtual Memory is always in use, even when the memory required by all running processes does not exceed the amount of RAM installed on the system.” - Source</p>
<p>Disabling System Restore</p>
<p>Myth - “Disabling System Restore improves performance.”</p>
<p>Reality - “System Restore does not cause any noticeable performance impact when monitoring your computer. The creation of a Restore point also is a very fast process and usually takes only a few seconds. Scheduled System Checkpoints (every 24 hours by default) are created only at system idle time to avoid interfering with a computer during use.” - Source</p>
<p>FAT32 is better than NTFS</p>
<p>Myth - “The FAT32 file system is better than NTFS.”</p>
<p>Reality - “NTFS is the better file system with many advantages over FAT32. NTFS features: Built-In Security, Recoverability, Alternate Streams, Custom File Attributes, Compression, Object Permissions, Economical Disk Space Usage using a more Efficient Cluster Size and Fault Tolerance. Windows 2000 and XP come with NTFS version 5 which includes even more advanced features such as: Encryption, Disk Quotas, Sparse Files, Reparse Points, Volume Mount Points. None of which is available with FAT32.” - Comparison Chart</p>
<p>Performance<br>
NTFS is built for speed with impressive disk I/O performance on large volumes (Over 400 MB). NTFS uses a binary tree structure for all disk directories, which reduces the number of times the system has to access the disk to locate files. This system is best for large directories, and NTFS easily outperforms FAT32 in these situations. In addition, NTFS automatically sorts files in a folder on the fly. NTFS gains an edge over FAT32 by using relatively small disk allocation units (cluster sizes) for NTFS volumes. Smaller clusters prevent wasted disk space on volumes, especially those with numerous small files. Because NTFS uses small clusters better and has a more efficient design, its performance doesn’t degrade with large volumes, in contrast to FAT’s. As the number of files and volume size increases NTFS performance is not effected but FAT32 continually gets worse. - Gaming Performance</p>
<p>Reliability<br>
In addition to its extensive memory and application protection features, NTFS is a reliable file system. When storing data to disk, NTFS records file I/O events to a special transaction log. If the system crashes or encounters an interruption, NTFS can use this log to restore the volume and prevent corruption from an abnormal program termination or system shutdown. NTFS doesn’t commit an action to disk until it verifies the successful completion of the action. This precaution helps prevent corruption of an NTFS volume. NTFS also supports hot-fixing disk sectors, where the OS automatically blocks out bad disk sectors and relocates data from these sectors. This housecleaning happens in the background. An application attempting to read or write data on a hot-fixed area will never know the disk had a problem. I only recommend and use NTFS with Windows 2000 and XP." - Source</p>
<p>L2 Cache Tweak</p>
<p>Alias - SecondLevelDataCache Tweak</p>
<p>Myth - “Adjusting the SecondLevelDataCache Registry value to match your CPU’s L2 Cache size improves performance.”</p>
<p>Reality - “If you do not set this registry value, Windows will use the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) for retrieval of the L2 cache size automatically on boot up. If this fails, a default value of 256KB is used. This is where the myth that XP can only use 256KB of L2 cache comes from. But it’s false. The SecondLevelDataCache is designed as a secondary source of cache size information for computers on which the HAL cannot detect the L2 cache. The HAL is able to retrieve the L2 cache size from any CPU using the set-associative cache design (Pentium II or newer), it’s only the relatively few older processors with direct-mapped L2 caches that the HAL will not recognize. This tweak only applies to older computers (Pentium I or older) with over 64 MB of memory. On these older systems, this tweak can improve performance by about 0.4%. Pentium II and later CPUs are not affected.” - Source</p>
<p>IO Page Lock Limit Tweak</p>
<p>Myth - “Increasing the IO Page Lock Limit will lock more memory for exclusive access by the kernel, improving performance”</p>
<p>Reality - “Indeed, it does do this but only in an RTM Windows 2000 machine. It does absolutely nothing in Windows 2000 Service Pack 1 and up, and absolutely nothing in Windows XP. This makes it effectively useless, since no one in their right minds would be running RTM Windows 2000. The RTM kernel references IoPageLockLimit. The SP1 kernel does not. Neither do any subsequent editions of the kernel; neither does the XP kernel in any of its incarnations.” - Source</p>
<p>IRQ Priority Tweak</p>
<p>Myth - “Adjusting the Priority of IRQs especially IRQ 8 improves system performance.”</p>
<p>Reality - “IRQs don’t even HAVE a concept of “priority” in the NT family; they do have something called “IRQL” (interrupt request level) associated with them. But the interval timer interrupt is already assigned a higher IRQL than any I/O devices, second only to the inter-processor interrupt used in an MP machine. The NT family of OSes don’t even use the real-time clock (IRQ Cool for time keeping in the first place! They use programmable interval timer (8254, on IRQ 0) for driving system time keeping, CPU time accounting, and so on. IRQ 8 is used for profiling, but profiling is almost never turned on except in very rare development environments. Even if it was possible it doesn’t even make sense why adjusting the real-time clock priority would boost performance? The real-time clock is associated with time keeping not CPU frequency. I would not be surprised if this originated in an overclocking forum somewhere. This “tweak” can be found in most XP all-in-one tweaking applications. This is a perfect example of why they are not recommended.” - Source</p>
<p>LargeSystemCache Tweak</p>
<p>Myth - “Enabling this improves workstation performance.”</p>
<p>Reality - “LargeSystemCache determines whether the system maintains a standard size or a large size file system cache, and influences how often the system writes changed pages to disk. Increasing the size of the file system cache generally improves file server performance, but it reduces the physical memory space available to applications and services. Similarly, writing system data less frequently minimizes use of the disk subsystem, but the changed pages occupy memory that might otherwise be used by applications. On workstations this increases paging and causes longer delays whenever you start a new app. Simply put enable this on a file server and disable it on everything else.” - Source</p>
<p>Moving the Pagefile</p>
<p>Continued on next post…[br][size=1]Posted at: July 18, 2006, 02:17:32 PM[/size][hr]Myth - “Moving the Pagefile to a different partition on the same drive improves performance.”</p>
<p>Reality - “Moving the Pagefile to a different partition on the same physical hard disk drive does not improve performance. Simply using a different partition on the same drive will result in lots more head-seeking activity, as the drive jumps between the Windows and page file partitions. Even though moving the pagefile in this case can have the positive effect of defragmenting it, the loss in I/O performance out weighs any gains. It is better to simply defragment the pagefile using PageDefrag and keep maximum I/O performance by leaving the pagefile where it is with a single drive setup. However you can enhance performance by putting the pagefile on a different partition and on a different physical hard disk drive. That way, Windows can handle multiple I/O requests more quickly. When the pagefile is on the boot partition, Windows must perform disk reading and writing requests on both the system folder and the pagefile. When the pagefile is moved to a different partition and a different physical hard disk drive, there is less competition between reading and writing requests.” - Source</p>
<p>Notes - The only exception to this is if the Windows Operating System is not installed on the first physical partition of the disk. This would not be a default installation nor is it recommended.</p>
<p>NTFS is Fragmentation Free</p>
<p>Myth - “The NTFS File system does not get fragmented and Defragmenters are unnecessary.”</p>
<p>Reality - “Even though NTFS is more resistant to fragmentation than FAT, it can and does still fragment. The reason NTFS is less prone to fragmentation is that it makes intelligent choices about where to store file data on the disk. NTFS reserves space for the expansion of the Master File Table, reducing fragmentation of its structures. In contrast to FAT’s first-come, first-served method, NTFS’s method of writing files minimizes, but does not eliminate, the problem of file fragmentation on NTFS volumes.” - Source</p>
<p>QoS Tweak</p>
<p>Myth - “Disabling QoS will free up the 20% bandwidth reserved by QoS”</p>
<p>Reality - “As in Windows 2000, programs can take advantage of QoS through the QoS APIs in Windows XP. 100% of the network bandwidth is available to be shared by all programs unless a program specifically requests priority bandwidth. This “reserved” bandwidth is still available to other programs unless the requesting program is sending data. By default, programs can reserve up to an aggregate bandwidth of 20% of the underlying link speed on each interface on an end computer. If the program that reserved the bandwidth is not sending sufficient data to use it, the unused part of the reserved bandwidth is available for other data flows on the same host.” - Source</p>
<p>RAM Optimizers/Defragmenters</p>
<p>Myth - “Increasing the amount of available RAM improves performance.”</p>
<p>Reality - “RAM Optimizers have no effect, and at worst, they seriously degrade performance. Although gaining more available memory might seem beneficial, it isn’t. As RAM Optimizers force the available-memory counter up, they force other processes’ data and code out of memory. Say that you’re running Word, for example. As the optimizer forces the available-memory counter up, the text of open documents and the program code that was part of Word’s working set before the optimization (and was therefore present in physical memory) must be reread from disk as you continue to edit your document. The act of allocating, then freeing a large amount of virtual memory might, as a conceivable side effect, lead to blocks of contiguous available memory. However, because virtual memory masks the layout of physical memory from processes, processes can’t directly benefit from having virtual memory backed by contiguous physical memory. As processes execute and undergo working-set trimming and growth, their virtual-memory-to-physical-memory mappings will become fragmented despite the availability of contiguous memory.” - Source</p>
<p>Registry Cleaners</p>
<p>Myth - “Registry Cleaners improve performance.”</p>
<p>Reality - “A few hundred kilobytes of unused keys and values causes no noticeable performance impact on system operation. Even if the registry was massively bloated there would be little impact on the performance of anything other than exhaustive searches. Registry Cleaners can fix problems associated with traces of applications left behind due to incomplete uninstalls. So it seems that Registry junk is a Windows fact of life and that Registry cleaners will continue to have a place in the anal-sysadmin’s tool chest, at least until we’re all running .NET applications that store their per-user settings in XML files - and then of course we’ll need XML cleaners.” - Source</p>
<p>Windows 95/98/ME vs XP Reliability</p>
<p>Myth - “Windows 95/98/ME is as reliable as XP” - Comparison Chart - Reliability Video</p>
<p>Reality - "Windows XP is 10-30 times more reliable then Windows 95/98/ME. Windows XP Professional is built on the proven code base of Windows 2000, which features a 32-bit computing architecture, and a fully protected memory model. Windows XP offers several enhancements that make it the most reliable version of Windows yet: Application Compatibility, Compatibility Mode, Improved Device and Hardware Support, Shared DLL Support, Shutdown Event Tracker, Windows Driver Protection, Device Driver Rollback, Windows Installer, Auto Update, Dynamic Update, Windows Update, Shadow Copy Integration with Backup, Last Known Good Configuration, Automated System Recovery, System Restore Enhancements, Error Messaging and Product Support, Online Crash Analysis, " - Source</p>

Security Myths</li>
</ul>
<p>Limited User Accounts</p>
<p>Myth - “Limited User Accounts are a Realistic Security Solution.”</p>
<p>Reality - “On a nonmanaged XP machine today, it isn’t realistic to run without Administrator privileges. Unlike UNIX and UNIX-like systems such as Linux and Apple Computer’s Mac OS X, Windows isn’t very useable with a non-Administrator account, largely because so many applications are ignorant of rights and were written to work only with Administrator-level accounts. This is particularly problematic in a home environment, in which XP Home Edition’s crippled Limited Account type, designed for children and less-technical users, is virtually useless. In Windows XP, the lame Run As option, virtually hidden under a right-click menu that typical users will never know about, is a poor substitute.” - Source</p>
<p>"After you log on to a computer by using a Limited User Account, you may observe one or more of the following behaviors when you try to use a program that is not expressly designed for Windows XP.</p>
<ul>
<li>The program does not run.</li>
<li>The program stops responding (hangs).</li>
<li>You receive notification of run-time error 7 or run-time error 3446.</li>
<li>The program does not recognize that a CD-ROM is in the CD-ROM drive.</li>
<li>The program does not allow you to save files.</li>
<li>The program does not allow you to open files.</li>
<li>The program does not allow you to edit files.</li>
<li>The program displays a blank error message.</li>
<li>You cannot remove the program.</li>
<li>You cannot open the Help file.</li>
</ul>
<p>This behavior can occur because the Limited User Account prevents older programs from performing certain functions. Microsoft lists over 189 applications in this article alone that do not work right on a Limited User Account." - Source</p>
<p>Hosts File</p>
<p>Myth - “Special AntiSpyware Hosts Files are necessary to prevent Spyware infections.”</p>
<p>Reality - “Hosts Files are a waste of time and false security. Any Malware/Spyware can easily modify the Hosts File at will, even if it is set to Read-only. Frequently Malware/Spyware uses the Hosts File to redirect you Web Browser to other sites. CoolWebSearch hijackers are masters at altering Read-only (“locked down”) Hosts files. They can also redirect Windows to use a Hosts File that has nothing to do with the one you keep updating. The Hosts file is an archaic part of networking setups that was originally meant to be used on a LAN and was the legacy way to look up Domain Names on the ARPANET - DNS History. It tells a PC the fixed numeric address of the internal server(s) so the PC doesn’t have to go looking for them through all possible addresses. It can save time when “discovering” a LAN. I don’t consider 1970’s ARPANET technology useful against modern Malware/Spyware. Special AntiSpyware Hosts Files attempt to associate a known safe, numeric address with the names of sites you want to block. When the user or any process on the PC then tries to access a blocked site, it is instead directed to the safe location. This works as long as the site’s numeric IP address never changes. But IP addresses do change and they’re supposed to be able to. The Web operates via “dynamic” naming, where a human friendly name (<a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a>) is actually an alias for the real address, which is numeric. The numeric address can and will change from time to time as a site or server is moved or reconfigured. People with out-of-date addresses hardwired into their Hosts File will no longer be able to connect to any site whose numeric address has changed. The Hosts entry will permanently point them to a dead location! It’s almost impossible to update a Hosts file frequently enough to guard against all threats and even if you did, you’d probably also run into problems in accidentally blocking good sites that happened to move to new numeric addresses. Large Hosts Files also cause Internet related slowdowns due to DNS Client Server Caching and disabling DNS Client Server Caching is not a solution. KB318803 “The overall performance of the client computer decreases and the network traffic for DNS queries increases if the DNS resolver cache is deactivated.” When cleaning Malware/Spyware from a PC, it is much easier to check a clean Hosts File then one filled with thousands of lines of addresses. Considering how easily a Hosts File can be exploited, redirected and potentially block good sites, it is strongly recommended NOT to waste time using Special Hosts Files. Especially when proper Malware/Spyware protection can be achieved by simply using these steps, all without ever using a Hosts File.” - Source</p>
<p>Spyware, Malware and Virus Security</p>
<p>Myth - “It is impossible or difficult to secure Windows XP from Spyware, Malware or Viruses.”</p>
<p>Reality - “It is very easy to secure Windows XP, simply use Secure XP - A Windows XP Security Guide. To put it bluntly I simply do not get infected with anything. Keep in mind nothing can fully protect you from something you manually install.” - Source</p>
<p>Virus Hoaxes</p>
<p>Myth - “All Email Virus warnings are real.”</p>
<p>Reality - “With the increase in the growth of viruses and Trojan programs, many computer users have turned to the Internet as a fast and easy tool to warn friends and co-workers of these threats. At the same time, there has also been a growth of virus hoax warnings. These warnings often describe fantastical or impossible virus or Trojan program characteristics, but appear to be real and forwarding these hoax warnings to friends and co-workers only perpetuates the problem. If you receive an Email that you suspect is a hoax, do not forward it to anyone and never open the attachments. Check in the Vmyths Hoax Database to confirm it is a hoax and delete the Email. If the Email originated from someone you know, send them an Email explaining the hoax.” - Source</p>
<p>Vulnerabilities</p>
<p>Myth - “Windows has more Security Vulnerabilities than Linux/Unix”</p>
<p>Reality - “Between January 2005 and December 2005 there were 5198 reported vulnerabilities: 812 Windows operating system vulnerabilities; 2328 Unix/Linux operating vulnerabilities; and 2058 Multiple operating system vulnerabilities”</p>
