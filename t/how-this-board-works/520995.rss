    <title>How this board works</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-this-board-works/520995</link>
    <description>First of all, congrats on a first edition. You guys did an excellent job. I really look forward to seeing this continue. In order to help with it, I&#39;ve setup this board to hopefully simplify the discussion and channels of communication needed to assemble this thing.

Flame_, being the originator, has full moderator access over the group that can post in this board. You guys should/will have basic moderator privileges in this board (locking and sticking). Feel free to talk to flame_ who whoever else will be involved in the future management of the mopar monthly team.

If you guys don&#39;t already have a google docs setup, I would strongly recommend it. It will allow you all to work on the mopar monthly simultaneously and discuss it in real-time, along with long-term discussion and planning on this forum. It should also make transitioning over to the frontpage blog rather easy and quick.

Thanks and goodluck on future editions!</description>

              <p>Thanks Taharok! Although I think it’s only right for me to say that the first edition was entirely down to Flame_ so full congratulations to him!</p>
<p>(I can finally lock topics… my plan has begun <em>evil face</em>)</p>
