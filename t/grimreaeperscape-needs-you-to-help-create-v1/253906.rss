    <title>GrimReaeperscape needs you to help create v1!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/grimreaeperscape-needs-you-to-help-create-v1/253906</link>
    <description>    Currently I host a fairly popular server named Grimreaperscape, but its currently in its 0.79c beta stage. I need you to help bring it to v1. Anyone know a good source(317) that is kind of like runescape, but with better money making, skilling, and training?  

I dont mean the same graphics i mean the same you know... like the way runescape makes you learn as you go along your journey not how in most sources

you juts click shops or training and you go there and basically get spoon fed everything.


Cheers Happy new year everyone =]</description>
