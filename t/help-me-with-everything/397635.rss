I need someone to help me with my
Webclient. I have a few problems.on
My 317 server on my client the items arnt nulled but on my
Webclient they are. 2nd question how do I make a loader that I know is right for my server? 3rd question my 652 server has been up for one day and suddenly when I tried portfording it said my server was offline and I&#39;m 100% sure it isn&#39;t down. I&#39;ve checked my no-ip is up and everything. I have been using google.com and I need to know how to make my own loader or how to be able to un null some items. Thanks alot for reading this now please help!!!!</description>
