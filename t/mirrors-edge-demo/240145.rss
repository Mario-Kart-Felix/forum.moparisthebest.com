    <title>Mirrors edge demo</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mirrors-edge-demo/240145</link>
    <description>I have said before that i really couldn&#39;t see this game working, well i was wrong - the demo has just been put up on the playstation store (Will be on xbox live tommorow) and i love it!

Gameplay is very nice, fluid and takes a bit of skill to play it properly. There is a few ways of playing it, trying to take the easy way usually takes much longer and can land you into much more trouble but taking ways that will require more skill ends up being the better way (obviously). 

Basically, if you have a ps3 go get the demo now and if you have a 360 get the demo soon as its out, something you really don&#39;t want to miss - i don&#39;t think there are many, if any games out at this time that are like this. 

Its out on PC, PS3 and 360 on november 13/14th.

EDIT: I think i won&#39;t be getting gears 2 on release now, i think i&#39;ll leave it to the end of november/start of december - i want to space my games out so i get the most out of them, with LBP coming out on the 5th here, Gears 2 the 7th and mirrors edge the 14th i might just get LBP and Mirrors edge.

I really don&#39;t know, i&#39;m on my 6th play through now and i&#39;m still loving it, getting better and better each time :)

EDIT2: Pre-ordered, just waiting for my code to unlock more content on the demo! :D</description>

<p>same as <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> in the training just before you do the weapon disarmerments if you split off after you climbed that ramp and do the course again you can go to the barbed wire area thats you cannot access previously in the training. You can get free roam of the course if you wander around before the weapons bit. Also its fun to try and kill the guys at the end just before you jump onto the heli, i killed all four on my third attempt was epic</p>

              <p>I don’t recall them ever marketing it as a game that you could choose your own path. They did in some of the gameplay videos say that you didn’t have to follow the red “Runner vision” things and if you do look at some of the other videos there is a good few other possible paths, just that were obviously not there in the level given in the demo.</p>

              <p>I wouldn’t say amazing. It’s a really fresh, clean game and makes a nice change from all the other games on the market. But the demo didn’t really give me the impression that you could choose your own path. You basically have to go the way the assist thing says and it seems really linear.</p>

              <p>I thought this game would work well its a nice concept<br>
Edit: Now i’ve downloaded it and played it thouroughly, i am extremely pleased with this as a demo, it is the best game i have played in a long time, there is so much freedom there that other games just lack, considering its a linear storyline the expansive options and choices you have are very good. I find the demo more enjoyable with the runner vision turned off because then its up to you to explore every crack and crevise for a way forward. I wish that i could pre-order this game so so much. But  have extremely little cash most of which is going into LBP so this will have to wait a little while im afraid but i must admit this is probably going to be the best(maybe second best depending on LBP) game of the christmas to come. The flow of the whole thing is immense and i find it a challenge to try and make it flow as best as possible.</p>
