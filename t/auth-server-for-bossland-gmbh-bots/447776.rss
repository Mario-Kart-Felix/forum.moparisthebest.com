Bossland GmbH have made bots for various games; WoT, SW:ToR, WoW and D3
As I have no idea of where to even begin cracking their bots like some communities have, I thought I&#39;d try something like this instead. It has worked before, hasn&#39;t it? (I&#39;m looking at you arhax)
So, thanks to de4dot and Reflector, I was able to decompile Honorbuddy and begin working on this.
Funnily enough when I was searching for older versions of Honorbuddy, I found one with someones (working) username and password stored in the properties file and with those could query the real auth server for dataz and shit

Right now probably the only bots that work are Tankleader (WoT, only authorizes with the server and does nothing more) and Demonbuddy (D3, at the moment the only supported game build is 10235 because the memory offsets have to be downloaded from the official auth server each time the game is updated)
I think Honorbuddy (WoW) would be fully functional if I had coded the loading/indexing/whatever of the mesh files for the game

I hope all that madee sense, think I&#39;ll head to bed now, TBAUS.zip contains the full project including source files etc, TBAUS_bin.zip only contains the compiled program and the required offset files

Oh and instructions on modifying the hosts file is located behind the &quot;Instructions&quot; button</description>

so i used it last night and it worked for about 5 minutes. after 5 minutes it would lose connection and give an error that basically said STOP CHEATING LOL and would close the game. my account status is still active, so i’ve not been banned. is this… normal?<br>

But from what I’ve read, I guess it’s best to keep the game in two separate folders, one for the bot and one for your real account, or you could run the bot inside VMWare or something. Some people have also been using proxies but idk if that’s really necessary.<br>
