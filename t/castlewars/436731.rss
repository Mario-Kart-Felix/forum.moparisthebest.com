[/code]
here is the castlewars line of code it is showing an error with: line 467
[code]            Client player = (Client) iterator.next();[/code]
This is the whole method
[code]
   public static void endGame() {
        Iterator iterator = gameRoom.keySet().iterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            Client player = (Client) iterator.next();

            player.sendMessage(&quot;[@red@CASTLE WARS@bla@] Kills: @red@ &quot; + player.cwKills + &quot; @bla@Deaths:@red@ &quot; + player.cwDeaths + &quot;@bla@ Games Played: @red@&quot; + player.cwGames + &quot;@bla@.&quot;);
            player.getPA().createPlayerHints(10, -1);
            player.isDead = false;

            if (scores[0] == scores[1]) {
                player.getItems().addItem(4067, 30);
                player.sendMessage(&quot;Tie game! You gain 30 CastleWars tickets!&quot;);
            } else if (team == 1) {
                if (scores[0] &gt; scores[1]) {
                    player.getItems().addItem(4067, 50);
                    player.sendMessage(&quot;You won the CastleWars Game. You received 50 CastleWars Tickets!&quot;);
                } else if (scores[0] &lt; scores[1]) {
                    player.getItems().addItem(4067, 20);
                    player.sendMessage(&quot;You lost the CastleWars Game. You received 20 CastleWars Tickets!&quot;);
                }
            } else if (team == 2) {
                if (scores[1] &gt; scores[0]) {
                    player.getItems().addItem(4067, 50);
                    player.sendMessage(&quot;You won the CastleWars Game. You received 50 CastleWars Tickets!&quot;);
                } else if (scores[1] &lt; scores[0]) {
                    player.getItems().addItem(4067, 20);
                    player.sendMessage(&quot;You lost the CastleWars Game. You received 20 CastleWars Tickets!&quot;);
                }
            }
        }
        resetGame();
            }
        }
    }
[/code]

This is where the spammed ending castlewars game method is
[code]
public static void resetGame() {
        changeFlagObject(4902, 0);
        changeFlagObject(4903, 1);
        setSaraFlag(0);
        setZammyFlag(0);
        timeRemaining = -1;
        System.out.println(&quot;Ending Castle Wars game.&quot;);
        gameStartTimer = GAME_START_TIMER;
        gameStarted = false;
        gameRoom.clear();
    }

              <p>i would deltede the void and remake a new one that workes with it “public static void resetGame() {” that my suggestion or you could just try this</p>
<p>public static void resetGame() {<br>
changeFlagObject(4902, 0);<br>
changeFlagObject(4903, 1);<br>
setSaraFlag(0);<br>

<p>i think that would work idk im working on delta server</p>
