              <p>[quote=“Kayceee, post:2, topic:328944”]This is either because you have got some sort of Custom Item on your account that the client cannot load so it just kicks you and logs out.<br>
Because you are nulled or because your source has something set so that you can only use a certain client.<br>
I wouldn’t know how to change it so you can use any client because I’ve never done it. But I’m sure there is a guide on how to make your server only useable from one client, so I’d just check that out but do it in reverse.</p>
<p>Hope this helped :|[/quote]</p>
<p>its not nulling from an object cause even with new accs it does this</p>
