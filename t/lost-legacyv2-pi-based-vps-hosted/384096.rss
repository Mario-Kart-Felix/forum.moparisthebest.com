    <description>[center]Hello everyone, my name is Dillon. Owner of Lost-Legacy. I am in need of a few employees.

First off I would like to introduce myself; My name is Dillon Willis, and I have been working with Java, RSPS coding, and all other material involving Runescape. I am currently 17 years old, and this year and next will be the last years of my Runescape career, I will be heading off to college to get a Computer Programming diploma.

I am only looking for a few developers at the moment. 
I need a good coder, I need a few things changed in the server.
I also need a webclient/forums programmer. The server can hold around 600-750 players without anytime type of lagg.

You must have atleast 8+ months of coding to become one of my employees. If you know how to make a webclient then please let me know.
