    <title>Cant connect to server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-connect-to-server/161832</link>
    <description>Well, i have 3 computers in my household and am trying to make a moparscape server out of one of them. i think i did something wrong with the no-ip site. or maybe i m not logging in right, sometimes i can log in but my friends cant. i successfully ran the compiler. then i hit runserver.bat no-ip is running. when moparscape client loads i hit new server ip jiescape.no-ip.biz i type in? then i hit new port, port = 43594, and start server, it says something like port already in use, i just ignore it and hit enter type in my info and change server ip to jiescape.no-ip.biz. i i think the problem is when i made the no-ip host, i didnt put my defualt gateway as my ip address. host type is dns host a and host name is jiescape.no-ip.biz, i start no-ip check it off but it doesnt work

any ideas thanks in advance,
