    <title>Can&#39;t connect to server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-connect-to-server/459466</link>
    <description>Hello, I was not sure if I am posting in the correct area. But I do believe that I have a client problem.
If this proves to be incorrect, then I am sorry for spamming this forum area and will abandon this thread.

But here is what is happening.

I have found a base, managed to do some editting and I wish to see if I am able to bring friends into the server to try out some of the changes that I have made.

I understand that inorder for others to join the game, I need to change the IP settings in the client.java or gui.java for the compiler, to my own.

I assume this is what I am meant to alter.

&lt;blockquote&gt;    public URL getCodeBase()
    {
        if(signlink.mainapp != null)
            return signlink.mainapp.getCodeBase();
        try
        {
                return new URL(&quot;http://my ip in here:&quot; + (43676));
        }&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So I alter is accordingly, compile, but when I try to log into the server.. I recieve &quot;error connecting to server.&quot;

I understand that portforwarding is required if one is using a router, but I am not(at this moment). I have a usb device to get connected, which I am using the IP address from. I know that ip addresses change from time to time. But that should not stop it from connecting at this moment(or so I think).

Can anyone shed any light on this?</description>

<p>Is it possible to add these lines of text in?</p>

<p><code>public static String server =</code> in your client folder client.java or gui.java &amp; change whatever is there to 127.0.0.1 then compile. Also, without a router their is probably no way for your friends to connect unless you try like utorrent or hamachi.</p>
