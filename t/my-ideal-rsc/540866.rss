    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-ideal-rsc/540866</link>
    <description>First off I&#39;ll say this.  You were never suppose to get flats on RSC.


1. 1x exp that never changes unless in wild to maybe 1.2x .

2.  Has an Auction House in Varrock.

3.  Has portals. (Not in wild) 

4.  P2P side of wild is 24/7 P2P Pking. Mage Arena status. 

5.  1IP only auto 5 day ban when caught.

6.  No char parking in wild, when logged sends you to Edgeville.

7.  Can log while running in wild like real RSC.

8. BATCHED EVENTS FOR EVERY SKILL.

<p>I am not, but I see why that confused you.  What we’re doing is emulating runescape classic.  I want people experienced in this process.  It just so happens one of the popular runescape emulators is called rscemulation (aptly named, perhaps).[/quote]Did you ever find someone to help you with your own server? I’d recommend partnering up with larsftw, you can find him on rscr (whenever he checks in). He was offering to pay for the rscr source to start up his own server. He seems willing to get a proper server up, reach out to him.</p>

<p>I am (clearly) new to the community but, as the rest of you, played RSC “back in the day.”  Now I’m an experienced c++/python developer looking for a long term java project and would love to partner up with one or two others who want to make something like what is described in this thread happen.  We have so many examples of success and failure in the RSC scene that one would have to be a fool to not at least recover server maintenance costs.</p>

              <p>Runescape classic was closed after 1 week of RS2 Beta. They closed of registration and buried the game looking to move forward with RS2.</p>
<p>Tbh, I believe if they release RSC like they did 07 - where it is not bottle necked and anyone can register- it would receive close to half the popularity of 07. That would be an estimated 5,000 online. If they have F2P open without the requirement of payment, most likely more. If you’re jagex and you can pull in 3k x $8 or whatever it is, that is 24,000 to their pocket without the need of a development team.</p>
<p>The game does not have to be updated or touched in any way. It’s not like all the players from old school or rs3 are going to be rushing to RSC but still, they have a player base and right now they are not making any money from it. Why not take the cash and open it up? As a company you should look back on what you achieved and recognize it. The players from RSC made that company, give back to the players and let us all be happy.</p>
<p>As for bots, that’s another story.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:8, topic:540866”]When RSC was reopened in 2009 there were over 5,000 players online. The reason it failed is because you had to register within that 2 week time period or whatever. After that you couldn’t make new accounts. RSC usually consists of 3+ accounts with 2 of them being pkers plus a main. Who is going to shell out almost $20 for 3 accounts?</p>
<p>The reason it failed is because they bottle necked it. Don’t feed me that bs.[/quote]</p>
<p>So what it would need is RSC F2P. Going back to my statement of a fudgefest of botters everywhere. Jagex isn’t going to spend any resources on this ancient game to develop bot detection as it would NEVER attract a playerbase again that is actually relevant to Jagex. 5000 people is a fraction of people on their other games.</p>
<p>With 1x rates and F2P opened up PKing might actually come back. But it would be ACers, stake botters and bots running around EVERYWHERE. Just like RSC actually was in late 2005-2006 without any support from Jagex. I think you are all forgetting what happened @ real RSC with 1x rates. No one liked training on those fudgeing rates, 99% of the community botted. That’s what you want to go back to?</p>
<p>Why do you even think RSC was closed? Because it was packed by bots and Jagex didn’t want to spend the time/resources to clean it up and it is probably not worth it for them to do so. They can’t just open up RSC and let it all go to shit again. They know what happens if they reopen it and that’s why they aren’t ever going to do so. Jagex has better things to spend their time on then a nearly 15 year old game with no playerbase left.</p>

<p>I’m tired of the same old colors and faces. Lets make some new sprites for all these different ideas.<br>
They could even be SUB functions so people have even more of a reason to buy subs.</p>

              <p>It is impossible to create something like RSC. The community already knows how to play the game, people rush to get the best equipment possible, buy and sell for huge profits. Rushing to 50 crafting, 85+ smithing, all this ruins the economy because some people become ridiculously rich and others pay the rich to become more rich.</p>
<p>What if there was a server where trading was not allowed for lets say 1 month or maybe longer? Got this idea from RSCR (Shinrael’s journal <a href="http://www.rscrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?id=12001" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rscrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?id=12001</a>). He has not traded anyone or bought any items from shops (well except those needed for skilling) and he has achieved quite a lot.<br>
This would add some oldschool feeling to the server, people would not rush for 40 1 x, instead there would be accounts with stats 30 20 x etc. Same goes with 99 99 99, you cannot sit anymore in wild afking since you have to make your own items aswell.<br>
This would remove the money problem, people would have no use for money since the most expensive item in shops (not counting Champ’s guild) is a2h 6400 gp.<br>
Of course there would have to be some extra additions too like you are not able to drop stackable items or items worth over 20 gp and when you die your stackable items won’t drop. To reduce the chance of bug exploiting.</p>
