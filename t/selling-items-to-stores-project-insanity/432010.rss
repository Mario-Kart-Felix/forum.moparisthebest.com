    <title>Selling Items To Stores [Project Insanity]</title>

    <description>How can I make it so players can sell items to stores, but those items won&#39;t go into the stores stock?

I need step one, which is to enable it so players can sell items to stores, and then step two is to make it so the items that they are selling won&#39;t go into that stores stock.

Thanks,
