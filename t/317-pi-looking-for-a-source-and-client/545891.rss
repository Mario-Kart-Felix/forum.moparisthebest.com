    <title>[317][PI] Looking for a source and client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-pi-looking-for-a-source-and-client/545891</link>
    <description>Hey everyone,

I seem to be a dumbf*** when I say I need a 317 PI source and client since there are so many out there, but I need one with the newer graphics [no 474], not too much unnecessary stuff like customs, torva isn&#39;t needed either. 

I mean a bit like InsidiaX but I heard people complaining about memleaks and such, and I wouldn&#39;t want to start on a base that isn&#39;t good.

If you think you know what I&#39;m talking about please post one here, thanks alot, been looking for a good one for days now.
