    <description>Now I love the game series and can&#39;t wait will 2.5 final mix and kh3 comes out, yet I just heard today that the 3rd one won&#39;t be the last one, yet after watching a time line video..were do they go next?  Well not sure, but after looking at keyblades to model and then going to look for a kh wallpaper I just realized how similar roxas and ventus look.

Now this makes sense, since ventus gave his heart to sora, which I think, and that&#39;s why sora has the keyblade and all of that.  But wouldn&#39;t that idea make &quot;roxas&quot; name...well not his name since he would be consider ventus&#39;s nobody and not soras which gives me the idea is the organizations 13 member really &quot;roxas&quot; or some other person?  Now I only played kh1, kh2, chain of memories(GBA), and birth by sleep and wondering if you guys can clear up my confusion. :)

With idea the game can expand and show the true story of ventus and how I think sora is being used as a type of &quot;pod&quot; keeping ventus alive for some final showdown or major plot twist lol, but im sure im not the first to have looked at this game from a different direction and maybe this quetstion has already been answered</description>

<p>Well for Roxas and Ventus looking near-identical when Roxas is Sora’s nobody, its because Sora is just harboring Vent’s heart until he can awaken. Roxas looks like Vent because it took after his heart, not Sora’s. Also, if you played 358/2 Days you’d see that Sora did have a nobody that actually did resemble him somewhat - Xion. I don’t want to spoil a lot, so I’ll leave it there. Hopefully I cleared it up a bit for you.</p>
