    <description>They&#39;re planning to test another missile that can hit the US. You know what this means... the middle of the pacific ocean better watch its back

clip: 2:17

And for a while we thought Un would westernize NK, guess not. Livin in da shadows



&lt;blockquote&gt;NORTH Korea has poached Michael Jackson&#39;s peace anthem We Are the World to soundtrack a chilling video showing a US city under missile attack.
The bizarre footage, uploaded on the secretive state&#39;s official webpage, comes as Kim Jong-un prepares for an &quot;imminent&quot; nuclear weapon test.
The propaganda movie depicts a smiling lad dreaming of a regime rocket being launched into the air and travelling to America.
The three-and-a-half minute vid then shows a mystery city full of skyscrapers being attacked with multiple explosions, while the Stars and Stripes flag flutters in the background.
Captions on the screen written in Korean say: &quot;Somewhere in the United States, black clouds of smoke are billowing.
 
 
Video:
North Korea release video of attack on America
News
PROPAGANDA movie has been uploaded on the regime&#39;s official website and shows city under fire
&quot;It seems that the nest of wickedness is ablaze with the fire started by itself.&quot;
The video ends with the lad concluding that his dream will &quot;surely come true&quot;.
&quot;Despite all kinds of attempts by imperialists to isolate and crush us... never will anyone be able to stop the people marching toward a final victory,&quot; it said.

Tune ... North Korea video has Jacko song in background
The film has emerged on the day that South Korea warned that a nuclear test by the North &quot;seems to be imminent&quot;.
Ambassador Kim Sook said there are “very busy activities” taking place at North Korea’s nuclear test site “and everybody’s watching”.
We Are the World was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie in 1985 and recorded as a charity single by USA for Africa.
It sold more than 20million copies and topped charts throughout the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

Tell me why I should thank you military. WWII doesn’t count, as Europe would have won the war alone, and you only joined when force into it. WWI doesn’t count as we weren’t really involved. The Napoleon wars doesn’t count since losing against Britain was the best for us.</p>
<p>You don’t clean up other people’s mess, you create it.</p>

True, so when you are starting a unjustified war you are in reality declaring a killing spree. As said before, United States are not innocent since it keep on electing mass-murders. I really hope that Iran doesn’t stop its nuclear program, or else they will be the next target of United States’ war machine.</p>

A nuclear weapon is NOT a doomsday device. North Korea might kill 2-3 million, thats it. US deserve it as a country ([Insert list of wars here]). The problem in the cold war was the amount and yield of the war heads, not simply the technology.</p>

<p>If you were the head of DPRK’s nuclear department, would you waste all you enriched uranium on simple test if your goal was to use it for attack? Since North Korea have quite few nuclear warheads and few missiles to carry them, would US be able to justify total destruction of the country? And what prevents North Korean leaders from launching an attack and then hide in a nuclear bomb-shelter?<br>
(I’m pretty sure they have some sort of tunnel system underneath Pyongyang that leads to some sort of cold war underground facility on the countryside. Or else they are pretty bad bad guys.) [size=8pt](Note: I must never been allowed to become dictator of a country with nuclear weapons.)[/size]</p>
<p>While searching for information about DPRK and Israels nuclear capabilities, I found an interesting chart in this article about range of the nuclear weapon. How it is possible that North Korea has the longest range? As opposed to Israel that barely can reach anything.<br>

<p>They would however beat France in a nuclear war, maybe time to pick an easier target?</p>
<p>To those who worrying about NY: North Korea cannot reach it. And the Floridans in here are even safer.</p>

<p>Niall: Are the any truth to the claim that North Korea might have produced weapons that transfer more of its energy into EMP than normal nuclear bombs, and we have therefore measured a lower yield? If they succeed, will the EMP make anything to damage US’ nuclear capability?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I can’t answer the first question but to the second question: absolutely not. An EMP attack on America may be an issue if the instigator is a military super power, but for anything less than a military super power the damage to the US military forces would be insignificant.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that America has something like 13 active aircraft carriers, compared to most other countries who have as little as 1-2, and that America has deployed nuclear subs. Even if a military super power launched its missiles at America and America couldn’t defend, America still would have the capacity to launch a fuck ton of missiles back, hence the term mutually assured destruction.</p>

<p>Are you comparing NK’s modern nuclear weapons to the ones the US used in WWII?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, the DPRK has less capacity than the US had in WWII. Their 2006 launch was 1 kiloton, their 2009 launch was 10-15 kilotons, the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 12-18 and 18-23 kilotons respectively. Keep in mind the US were testing nuclear weapons with a yield of 15,000 kilotons in 1954 (incidentally this 15,000 kiloton explosion also lead to the biggest accidental nuclear fallout caused by the States) and the USSR was testing nuclear weapons of 50,000 kilotons (was actually going to be a 100,000 kiloton bomb but they scaled back) in 1961, but these countries were nuclear superpowers at the time (and still are) while the DPRK has the least amount of nuclear weapons in a list of any country with nuclear weapons(even countries where those nuclear weapons are undeclared <em>coughisraelcough</em>).</p>
