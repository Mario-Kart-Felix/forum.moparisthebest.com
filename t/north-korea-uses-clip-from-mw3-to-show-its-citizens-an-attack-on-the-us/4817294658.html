<p>Bowser, idk what you have against the United States, but just from your attitude I can tell you are from the UK. Don’t be such an asshole and maybe our country will actually bail you guys out from more wars. Someone has to protect the world and the US is doing that. If you don’t like it, then there’s something wrong with you.</p>

<p>Please read the emboldened words.<br>
Frell, they entered into the war but they were not physically involved in it as no US soldiers were fighting in it.</p>
<p>[quote=“<a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090216033247AAFWjbM" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090216033247AAFWjbM</a>”]Difficult to say and it depends how you define “won”, but it would have probably gone one of 3 ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Russia would have defeated the Germans on the eastern front and invaded all of Germany and France/part of Germany and/or France (due to British and Commonwealth landings. Germany would have been defeated but the Soviet Union would have almost total control over Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Germany would have defeated Russia and made a peace agreement with Britain as Hitler himself displayed admiration of the British and a desire to live alongside the UK in peace (although he hated France).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Germany would have defeated Russia, turned on Britain and eventually invaded. If they dedicated their entire resources to it and managed to secure the English channel then they could have succeeded. The chances were though that the losses the Germans would have encountered would have meant they wouldn’t of tried it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: Just to put right some historical inaccuracies in some posts.</p>
<p>In response to a previous post stating that the British contribution on a worldwide level was rather small, I’d like to know what this comment is based on as it is hugely controversial and, at best, limited.<br>
I don’t have the time or the room to detail my case here, but just included a well known statement below.</p>
<p>Britain provided time, America provided money, Russia provided manpower. Without all three factors the Second World War would have turned out very differently.</p>
<p>In reference to the US involvement in the Second World War, America did not commit any soldiers whatsoever to the War until after Pearl Harbour. It is completely true that they were supplying the allies with equipment and weapons before this point, however, the question only specifies American entry into the war, not involvement.[/quote]</p>
<p>The Battle of Britain prevented a Nazi invasion of Britain, and the hundreds of pilots in the squadrons were made up mainly of Britons but also included Poles, Czechs… and 8 Americans (which is odd, considering that America bailed us out, right?)</p>
<p>On D-Day, there were five invasions. One of which was Canadian, two were American and two were British. The majority of footsoldiers were British and Canadian, the majority of aircraft were from the RAF, the majority of ships used were from the Royal Navy and a lot of the landing craft that were used to land the American footsoldiers were crewed by the Royal Navy. The first to land were also British, taking Pegasus bridge.</p>
<p>So whilst America did supply Europe, to say that we would all be “speaking German”, or “ruled by Hitler” if it wasn’t for you is both idiotic and almost entirely incorrect (because, remember, Spitfires were used in the Battle of Britain, which stopped a German invasion of Britain. The same Spitfire that was designed by R.J. Mitchell, a Briton and ran using a Rolls-Royce Merlin Engine which was created by Britons).</p>

        <p>Ambokile, I have never seen anything reliable say that Germany was planning on becoming allies with Britain. If you can provide me a good source then I may believe it. What I have seen is that without the help of the United States, Europe would have been fucked. You guys couldn’t handle it on your own and needed our help. We couldn’t have handled it on our own either. Who cares?</p>
<p>Why does North Korea even need to have serious weapons? If we feel threatened because a country that we have tensions with is developing major weapons, we should feel threatened and act on it.</p>

You might not know this, but before WWII, German was the most preferred foreign language in Norway. I also had 4.5 years of German in school. And why this idea that Germany would force us to speak German?</p>
<p>There is no other superpower to take the lead. And btw, you are not battling the Soviet Union any more, you are picking on weak countries with no friends.</p>

        <p>When I say ‘speaking German’ it is a metaphor – what I was implying was that Germany would have occupied most of Europe for some time.</p>
<p>China is a world power and they will be the biggest super power in the world eventually. We are only prolonging it for the time being.</p>
<p>I don’t think that America as a whole was ‘the hero’ (every soldier from every country that put his life on the line is a hero though…) but I know that without American money, resources, planning, and manpower there is no way that you would have won. The only countries that <em>might</em> have been able to stay sovereign were England and Russia. There were no other countries that could really fight a prolonged war against the German military.</p>
<p>ps: I know a little bit of German and I plan on mastering it one day. I wouldn’t care if that was the primary language of the world either.</p>

        <p>Britain, America and Russia all had near-equal influence on the outcome of the war but I don’t think that removing a singular one of the three would result in a loss.

Buchanan argues that both world wars were unnecessary and that the British Empire's decision to fight in them was disastrous for the world. One of Buchanan's express purposes is to undermine what he describes as a "Churchill cult" in America's élite and so he focuses particularly how Winston Churchill helped Britain get into wars with Germ  </p>

        <p>Well you have to remember America was supplying the allies with quite a bit shortly before we officially joined. IIRC A US submarine was found in the waters off the coast of Britain and that was what made Hitler order the attack so we’d “mind our business.” But he had plans to invade the US, he just wanted to take care of Europe first.</p>
<p>I think if America hadn’t joined it would have been somewhat of a loss. Not because of the US alone (We didn’t run in and save the world), but because Europe was yet to see the full throttle of the Japanese. We came in after everyone else was already exhausted, which gave a final push to win.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Frell, post:34, topic:481729”]Well you have to remember America was supplying the allies with quite a bit shortly before we officially joined. IIRC A US submarine was found in the waters off the coast of Britain and that was what made Hitler order the attack so we’d “mind our business.” But he had plans to invade the US, he just wanted to take care of Europe first.</p>
<p>I think if America hadn’t joined it would have been somewhat of a loss. Not because of the US alone (It’s not like we ran in and saved the world pfft), but because Europe was yet to see the full throttle of the Japanese.

<p>Apparently that submarine was attacked by Britain but that’s neither here nor there. I agree that it would have bee a loss but there is no evidence at all that Hitler would have successfully taken over the World or even Europe if the USA had not got involved.</p>

<p>if america had not intervened on the european front then the war on the european front would have been a lot more bloody, but it most certainly would not have been lost</p>
<p>it was the polish who first cracked the enigma codes(at least, the codes used by the german army and airforce), it was later that the british cracked the enigma code allowing codes from the navy to be read as well, if it wasn’t for the polish and british breaking the enigma code then d-day would never have happened, or would quite literally have been much more of a blood bath than it was</p>
<p>what a lot of americans seem to forget though that while the war on the <span class="bbcode-b">EUROPEAN</span> front may not have been going so well, the battle on the soviet front was lost to the germans years before d-day, and while I say the war on the european front was going bad, the battle of britain was a turning point in the war and wasn’t aided by the americans</p>

<p>Well of course, I never said that. I said it would have been a partial loss. You may have lost territory here or there and some countries may not have been recovered, and then Hitler would have just fueled up and tried again.</p>
<p>You also couldn’t say Hitler would have been killed either. Maybe, Maybe not. We won’t ever know. If we refused to attack even after Hitler declared war I’m sure he would have had the Japanese come to help in Europe which may have been overwhelming. Most of our work wasn’t even in Europe.</p>

Yea Israel is just as bad, but they won’t do anything because the US could undo everything they’ve done for them. Israel is surrounded by people who hate not only their religion but also their style of government. It makes sense to arm them and back them up IN THEORY, as long as they do not actually act.</p>
<p>The UK is trying to build weapons to threaten us to stop putting sanctions on them<br>
We’re putting sanctions on them because their only target is us</p>
<p>It’s a shame they’re only focused on this.</p>
