    <title>Adding fly command into an item [pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-fly-command-into-an-item-pi/398442</link>
    <description>hey guys, i have a ::God command and i wont to make an item so when you wear it you fly but when you wear it atm you go up in the air as you&#39;d normaly do with the command but when you go back to the ground and don&#39;t fly.

i think it may be because when the command when you wear an item you stop flying as well and since you wear the cape it stops you, if anyone has a better command please post. 

here is my code i added for the cape to make you fly.

[code]
 if(c.wearId == 6959) {
 if (c.playerStandIndex != 1501) {
				c.startAnimation(1500);
				c.playerStandIndex = 1501;
				c.playerTurnIndex = 1851;
				c.playerWalkIndex = 1851;
				c.playerTurn180Index = 1851;
				c.playerTurn90CWIndex = 1501;
				c.playerTurn90CCWIndex = 1501;
				c.playerRunIndex = 1851;
				c.updateRequired = true;
				c.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
                              }
                    }[/code]</description>
