    <title>XBox 360 LIVE NAT setting changed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xbox-360-live-nat-setting-changed/238378</link>
    <description>My NAT was normally moderate and i could do everything fine except connect to a few people, but i could connect to all my friends. It recently started appearing as &#39;Open&#39;, i know this is supposedly good, but not for me. Now none of my friends can connect to me, i cant connect to anyone. Im using a linksys WRT54GS and there is no guide on how to change your NAT back and forth from strict, moderate, and open, just a guide for getting it to open.</description>

              <p>I had the same problem with the Linksys BEFSR41 router, I got a simple $10 router that doesnt have port forwarding or any of that shit and works perfect.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
but on the other hand I’ve always had a problem with Linksys routers with my modem (my modem also has a page you have to portforward even though its 1 port)</p>

              <p>I really dont want to do anything like that at first, because all we changed was the network name, and since i hook my xbox to my laptop to get LIVE that wouldnt effect it unless the laptop doesnt have the updated name, which it does.</p>
