    <description>I was at the bar last night for my buddies 21st birthday party, and needless to say it didn&#39;t end to well. We got a $30 drink special which included domestics, bombs, and mixed drinks for 4 hours, it was pretty much worth it since beers were about $2, bombs are about $3-$4 and mixed are about $4-$5.. So as were getting our drinks the bartender made a couple comments about us not tipping, and honestly we probably gave her about $3 the whole time we were there. She was pretty heavyset and we were all pretty drunk after awhile, so after she made a second comment about us not tipping her I told her to shut her fat ****ing mouth and to do her job. She brings over the manager, he asks me what the problem is, and obviously belligerant I told him that his fat ass waitress was asking for tips, which is something you aren&#39;t supposed to do anyways as a bartender/sever.

SO anywho, she gets mad, I tell the manager his bar is a dump and I wanted my money back for the poor service. We start arguing, a bouncer comes over, and puts his hands on my wrist, so I punched him in the face and there was a fight with like 3 of us and a couple of the bouncers. The Cops come and ask me what happened, I told him the bouncer put his hands on me and I punched him for touching me. He put me in cuffs and ask me where I was from, so I told him West Philadelphia born and raised on the playground where I spent most of my days chilling out, maxing and relaxing all cool and all shooting some b-ball
outside of school when a couple of guys they were up to no good started making trouble in our neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared she said your moving in with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.</description>
