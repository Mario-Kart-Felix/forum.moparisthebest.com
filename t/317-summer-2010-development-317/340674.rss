    <description>Summers here (for most of us), since I got nothing much to do over summer, I decided to get a team together and maybe host a server. If not just make one.

Source: Chaospker v2, based on Delta but coded heavily...

My plans:

Clean the dead codes

Make codes more effecient

Add some nice features

Get rid of customs

LEARN

I&#39;ll add pics later, but to apply please fill this out

[code]
How long have you been coding?

If you have an MSN, what is it?

Do you have a problem with using Delta? If so, what source do you suggest? (NO 459+)

Suggestions -?
[/code]

Thanks guys.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Berky-Scape, post:8, topic:340674”]I am not applying cuz I have no time to, but I have lots of suggestions, there we go:<br>
You can add a jail+prison, which means when someone does something bad, send them to jail. When someone does something more badly, you can send them to prison. Also with a timer ofcourse.<br>
Do not add an specific area with lots of npc’s like, shops, make the people do something to get there.<br>
You can also make it GTA style, with the herbloring skill improved, like changing it to “Smuggle”. I know this is a RSPS server but I played GTA MP, so I have some GTA ideas which are fun to make, like changing Smithing to: Arms Dealing, so you can make weapons for people, which is aggainst the law, so you can make a Police Department, to Arrest you when they see you do (Jail).<br>
You can also use “Dropbox” to edit the server and make, so everyone has the chance to edit the source or unbann people, like seeing logs etc when they have to.<br>
Also Jayden told me, he also would make his Delta version with those things in it:<br>
Combat readded<br>
Fully handwrited Fletching, which he showed me.<br>
Lots of cleaned dead codes, he actuelly brought the server back to life.<br>
Making the name have “Summer” in it isn’t that great because, what will you do when it is winter?<br>
Good luck with the server ;)[/quote]<br>

              <p>Mack, Since this base is Delta your going to get a lot of unexperienced Java scripters applying. If I were you I would check to make sure they know what they are doing. I’m just saying this because I want your development to be successful.  Anyways. Good luck Mackenzie.</p>
