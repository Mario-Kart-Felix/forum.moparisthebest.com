    <title>I can&#39;t seem to make a rsps</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-seem-to-make-a-rsps/407744</link>
    <description>I have a problem, my computer is Windows 7 and every time I try to run the client it fails, sometimes the client runs but the server fails to run.

I would love if someone could help me.
