    <description>I have posted before with little luck. My pk points reset themselves to 0 but i don&#39;t understand the private server coding well enough yet to fix this problem by myself. 
However, you can see my code as i used a tutorial and this is the tutorial used
http://www.runelocus.com/forums/showthread.php?2763-317-Adding-Pk-Points-also-making-a-shop-for-it
What happens?
Well I kill someone, my points go to 1. I log out my points remain at 1, i log back in, and my points are put back to 0. If you see the problem here within this code please tell me as i need this fixed.
-Help Appreciated.</description>
