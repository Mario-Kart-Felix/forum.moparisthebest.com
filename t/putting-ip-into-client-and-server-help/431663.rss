    <title>Putting ip into client and server help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/putting-ip-into-client-and-server-help/431663</link>
    <description>Well it seems like i finally got the portforwarding thing right. I know i am suppose to put an ip into the client and maybe the source. I am using the dragon history source im pretty sure its a PI just modified alot.

I do not know what files to put the ip in and i do not know exactly what ip to use. do i put my no-ip thing? Ex: (rspsname).no-ip.biz

Or do i actually put my external ip in? 

Someone please help me with this =D</description>
