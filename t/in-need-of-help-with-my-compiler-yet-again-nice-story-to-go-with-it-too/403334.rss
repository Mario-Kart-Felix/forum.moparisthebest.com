    <description>This is how it all started...
So last summer I went on vacation to Africa with my Mom and Dad, while we were there we went on an exotic bush-walk, about halfway through our walk I decided to relieve my self on a near by tree, it was all going fine, then I happened to to notice an old temple to the right of me. Being the mighty courageous adventurer I am I set off to see what I could find. It was a magnificent temple that look as though is had been untouched for centuries. I then noticed there was something mounted onto the top of the temple, it was the mostly beautiful diamond I have ever layed my eyes on suddenly I found myself climbing the temple eager to get my hands on it, I ripped that diamond right off its mount and suddenly I heard a deathly screech! I quickly turned around to see a Arch Voodoo Priest gazing at me and chanting a ghastly verse, he then pulled from his pocket a necklace with seemed to be made out of human fingers (I&#39;m not to sure) then he said to me &#39;May the almighty Baron Samedi have no mercy on our soul! be gone from our holy site and may all of your RuneScape Private Server compilers fail!&#39;

So that&#39;s how it all started, and hopefully this is were it will end :\
I&#39;ve been having compiler issues ever since last summer, I get them fixed, then they get them selves broken.

These are the only compiler issues I ever get so if someone could tell me the solutions to them, I will be free from my Voodoo curse.
