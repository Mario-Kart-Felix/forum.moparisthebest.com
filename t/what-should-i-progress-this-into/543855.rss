    <title>What should I progress this into?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-should-i-progress-this-into/543855</link>
    <description>Just built a pretty nifty application, reads bank items from in-game and displays them on the site with images. 
I can switch this to reading inventory items too.

Here is a basic example of just a few items..
http://tinypic.com/r/i71pb7/8

But no need to worry, supports hundreds of items too.
http://tinypic.com/r/2e4jne1/8

[b]Bugs so far[/b]
Runescape likes to do this thing where it stores as you having item id 4152 which is a noted whip, when you really have 4151 (unnoted whip). Currently I have it reading the image as $itemID-1.. Which works fine for the noted items, but not the items that cannot be noted.

Anyways, what should I progress this into? I was thinking of a web-based grand exchange. And also into an administration panel for admins (to check player inventories/banks).

I have all items in 25x25 resolution, and all items in 96x96 resolution.

Forgot to throw in credits.

<p>Because it’s not just as efficient, I made that clear in the last post. If you make one thing to a certain standard, make everything to that standard. This is what’s known as not being an idiot. You work to a certain standard on one aspect of a job, you work to that standard for everything.</p>

<p>++ An efficient way would be to have the bank saved to SQL also, and when a player closes the bank, it checks the current state of the bank, and amends changes (if any) to the SQL version. Honestly, there isn’t really a way that this system can be super efficient, and mass-scaled. This would be perfect for users that are suspected dupers, and you add them onto a watch list. Where if they’re on the watch list, their bank, inventory, stats, etc. Are saved to SQL for moderating.</p>
<p>EDIT: I literally made up the whole watch list thing on the spot, now it’s time to do it. o.O</p>

              <p>One method RSCD used is having the login server able to be queried live. So I could make a socket connection to localhost:xxxx, send a specific string like “bank username”, and it could return a list of their items. This pretty much allowed you to interact with players in real time from the website.</p>

<p>For my part, I was just saying that it’d look better (aesthetics and shit) if you made it look (and scroll) like the bank.</p>
<p>And for Kozs, server sided you would update the SQL database when the player exits the bank, how you will manage that is up to you.</p>

              <p>Just built a pretty nifty application, reads bank items from in-game and displays them on the site with images.<br>
I can switch this to reading inventory items too.</p>
<p>Here is a basic example of just a few items…<br>
<a href="http://tinypic.com/r/i71pb7/8" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://tinypic.com/r/i71pb7/8</a></p>
<p>But no need to worry, supports hundreds of items too.<br>
<a href="http://tinypic.com/r/2e4jne1/8" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://tinypic.com/r/2e4jne1/8</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Bugs so far</span><br>
Runescape likes to do this thing where it stores as you having item id 4152 which is a noted whip, when you really have 4151 (unnoted whip). Currently I have it reading the image as $itemID-1… Which works fine for the noted items, but not the items that cannot be noted.</p>
<p>Anyways, what should I progress this into? I was thinking of a web-based grand exchange. And also into an administration panel for admins (to check player inventories/banks).</p>
<p>I have all items in 25x25 resolution, and all items in 96x96 resolution.</p>
<p>Forgot to throw in credits.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">SK8rDude</span> - Helping me rip the item images from my cache by giving me a method from <span class="bbcode-b">Galkon</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Runescape</span> - Having a simple set up that allowed me to rip the grand-exchange view of the items (in 96x96)</p>
