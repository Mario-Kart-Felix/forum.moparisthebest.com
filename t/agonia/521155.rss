[b]Introduction[/b]

Hello sweet Community.
As in the title, you see the name of the Server i am working on.
I dont got any Developers yet, but would try to give my best to get the best, maturest and loyalest Developers I&#39;ve had.
I am thinking of making this a fully finished Server. I already know that this is going to beat every new Server out there, cause this is NOT a &#39;leech&#39; .
We will bring up our own Ideas, our own things, and do the best from it.
We wont be using an almost finished source, no, we are going to use a clean PI Source with netty.

              <p>You should make it more detailed. Tell people what your plans are with the server, how it’s going to be maintained, if you plan on getting a large community, etc. Showing that you took time and effort into your server development thread really pays off in the long run. You’ll get more people that are interested in it if it looks good, and took time to make.</p>

I like the login screen, but a background would be nice. It’s kind of pointless to show off all the packaging, because there’s really not that many modifications to it. Has there been any recent updates prior to what’s shown above?</p>
