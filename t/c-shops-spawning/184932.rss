    <title>C++, Shops, Spawning</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-shops-spawning/184932</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m new with C++ Coding and I was wondering if this is what you guys code with? because I&#39;m looking for someone that can kind of mentor me in C++, I have a private server of my own but I didnt make the source, I just edited a bit, and I was wondering how these servers where made, and with what compiler (DEV C++, MVSC++, Bolsar,....Exc). Also I wanted to know how to move NPC Shops, and I can&#39;t spawn any 5 Digit items, Like Godswords, 3rd Age, exc,. I have heard that shops are moved by Autospawn.cfg but my autospawn isn&#39;t a notepad file, or one with which i can edit, It&#39;s an internet file. So I can&#39;t edit it. Well this is all I need for now,

Yes, shops are in autospawn but, there might be a cfg folder, depends on the server, anyway but its a cfg file so it should open with notepad, and most servers use item for 5 digit items</p>
