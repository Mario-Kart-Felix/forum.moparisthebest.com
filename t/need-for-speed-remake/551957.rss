They really need to get rid of that arcade driving physics shit. I believe that if they did that, this would be the most popular <span class="bbcode-s">racing </span> ricing game of this generation.<br>
[/quote]<br>
False, the fact that it is an arcade racing game (some titles have even been considered simcade) is why it’s so popular with it’s followers. Sim racing games such as Project Cars, and Assetto Corsa have their own following because of the fact that they are in-depth simulation physics games, NFS Shift and its sequel were considered ‘simcades’ by some, those didn’t do so well because of the mixed feelings towards it. Making the physics realistic would ultimately kill the series and nobody would play it. Sim racers don’t want all that customization and story bullshit, arcade racers don’t want it to be extremely challenging to play it. Think of the border between Arma and Call of Duty. If Call of Duty had realism like Arma, nobody would play it. If Arma was run n’ gun like COD, none of the current players would play it.[/quote]<br>
You are right to some degree. However there’s this another group of people right in between who like customization and realistic driving physics, a good example of game that did this is Forza.</p>

              <p>Looking forward too it. NFS has always had the best customization and largest vehicle counts, been a fan ever since NFS Underground 2. Really glad for PC support, because there aren’t very many games like it available on PC other than the other NFS titles. The Crew was supposed to be able to run with it, but turned out to be shit. Looking forwards to what they do with this title.</p>
