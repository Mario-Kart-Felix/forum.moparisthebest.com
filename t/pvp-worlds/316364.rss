    <description>Okay well on my 525 Server and Client, I figured out how to enable PvP worlds through the client, and you can log in, down the bottom it will have like if you were level 100, it would show what levels you can attack. In this case it has &quot;85 - 116&quot;. The only problem I have is that it doesn&#39;t load the game screen. It stays black with &quot;Loading - Please Wait&quot;.

Interfaces open fine, but I can&#39;t seem to get the actual game window to show. Does anyone have any ideas?</description>
