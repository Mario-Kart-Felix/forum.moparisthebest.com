    <title>Delta NPC Drops? Please Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-npc-drops-please-help/466304</link>
    <description>So I asked this question a few months back but never got a reply  :(

In a delta NPC drops are put into the nocdrops.cfg file which I&#39;m sure everyone knows, but when you put in the last number in a line, (how often something drops) it makes it so it&#39;s the chance of receiving not only that item, but other possible drops as well. It&#39;s hard to explain, but here i&#39;ll try and make some more sense of it:

Here&#39;s an example of possible drops for a Man.

[code=java]//Man
npcdrop = 1     526     1       100
npcdrop = 1     995     500     50
npcdrop = 1     494     1       10
npcdrop = 1     841     1       8
npcdrop = 1     882     50      8
npcdrop = 1     1062    250     1[/code]

There is a 50% chance to receive 500 coins as a drop, but also smaller chances for other items.
It&#39;s possible, yet not as likely, to receive the coins and another item in the same drop, which is what I want to fix.
I want to make it so when you kill an NPC, you can only receive two items, such as bones/ashes, and another item.

Hopefully this makes sense, I think most 508&#39;s work this way but I don&#39;t have an experience with 508&#39;s so not sure.
Help of any kind would be greatly appreciated</description>

              <p>I suggest re-writing the entire system as well. While you’re at it, you should add 5 values.</p>
<p>You could do something such as make Default Drops for the Bones/Ashes + your System of fetching the Drop.</p>
