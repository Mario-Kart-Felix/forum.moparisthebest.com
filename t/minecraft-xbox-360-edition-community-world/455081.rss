    <title>Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition: Community World?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minecraft-xbox-360-edition-community-world/455081</link>
    <description>For the official thread click the link http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,560516.0.html

So as most of you know Minecraft Xbox edition is out and lots of people play it. I have thought of an Idea where we could run our own little Community World for the xbox. I know it will be hard as we&#39;d have no administrators or anything but its worth a shot. We could do like currencies being diamond, iron ingots, and gold ingots. Get your own plot of land and add on later to it. I have a lot of ideas if people would like to give it a go. I am willing to leave my xbox on 24/7 if it gets that popular. Right now I am leveling out an area for a starting area. 

So due to the problem of possible greifers, I am closing this community world to trusted members who are accepted through this application. Fill this application down below. Chassy and I will be communicating with each other about each applicant. Our decision will be PM&#39;d to you by me or Chassy. If you&#39;re accepted, more information will be disclosed to you. 

[code=Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition: Mopar Community World Member Application]
Name:
Age:
Past Contributions to the Mopar Community:
How long have you been registered: 
How can we trust you?: 
Do you agree to follow all rules(soon to be written) and if you are caught breaking any, you will be completely removed from my friends list and not be allowed to join the server:

Thank you for Applying. We will get back to you via PM ASAP.[/code]

The following rules must be followed while playing on the Mopar Community World
1.	No Duping allowed. Any form of duping will not be tolerated and you will be automatically kicked from the world and removed from my friends list.
2.	If friends want to join, they will have to sign into Moparscape and fill out the application that everyone else will have to. No one will be able to join without being on my friends list. Friends of Friends will be turned off but the world will be open to all who have been accepted.
3.	If your application was denied you have 30 days before applying again. If you apply before the 30 days are up, you will automatically be denied and you won’t be able to apply for another 30 days.
4.	By no means will you be allowed to rage/ spam this official thread or spam PM me or Chassy if you were denied. If you were denied, we have our reasons so please respect our choices.
5.	No TNT, Setting fire to peoples’ houses or any other form of griefing will be allowed. If you’re caught then you will automatically be kicked from the world and removed from my friends lists
6.	Depending on the severity of rules broken, all infractions vary. If they are severe enough, you will be added to a list of people who will never again have a chance to join the world again.

[b]If anyone who breaks these rules and who was kicked feels the reason to spam me over XBL with messages, I will block all communications with you and you will have no chance ever of coming back.[/b] 

Again, Only trusted members of the Mopar Community will be allowed to join this world, so if you’re accepted, enjoy the privilege and don’t abuse it!</description>

              <p>For the official thread click the link <a href="http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,560516.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,560516.0.html</a></p>
<p>So as most of you know Minecraft Xbox edition is out and lots of people play it. I have thought of an Idea where we could run our own little Community World for the xbox. I know it will be hard as we’d have no administrators or anything but its worth a shot. We could do like currencies being diamond, iron ingots, and gold ingots. Get your own plot of land and add on later to it. I have a lot of ideas if people would like to give it a go. I am willing to leave my xbox on 24/7 if it gets that popular. Right now I am leveling out an area for a starting area.</p>
<p>So due to the problem of possible greifers, I am closing this community world to trusted members who are accepted through this application. Fill this application down below. Chassy and I will be communicating with each other about each applicant. Our decision will be PM’d to you by me or Chassy. If you’re accepted, more information will be disclosed to you.</p>
<p>[code=Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition: Mopar Community World Member Application]<br>
Name:<br>
Age:<br>
Past Contributions to the Mopar Community:<br>
How long have you been registered:<br>
How can we trust you?:<br>
Do you agree to follow all rules(soon to be written) and if you are caught breaking any, you will be completely removed from my friends list and not be allowed to join the server:</p>
<p>Thank you for Applying. We will get back to you via PM ASAP.[/code]</p>
<p>The following rules must be followed while playing on the Mopar Community World</p>
<ol>
<li>No Duping allowed. Any form of duping will not be tolerated and you will be automatically kicked from the world and removed from my friends list.</li>
<li>If friends want to join, they will have to sign into Moparscape and fill out the application that everyone else will have to. No one will be able to join without being on my friends list. Friends of Friends will be turned off but the world will be open to all who have been accepted.</li>
<li>If your application was denied you have 30 days before applying again. If you apply before the 30 days are up, you will automatically be denied and you won’t be able to apply for another 30 days.</li>
<li>By no means will you be allowed to rage/ spam this official thread or spam PM me or Chassy if you were denied. If you were denied, we have our reasons so please respect our choices.</li>
<li>No TNT, Setting fire to peoples’ houses or any other form of griefing will be allowed. If you’re caught then you will automatically be kicked from the world and removed from my friends lists</li>
<li>Depending on the severity of rules broken, all infractions vary. If they are severe enough, you will be added to a list of people who will never again have a chance to join the world again.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">If anyone who breaks these rules and who was kicked feels the reason to spam me over XBL with messages, I will block all communications with you and you will have no chance ever of coming back.</span></p>
<p>Again, Only trusted members of the Mopar Community will be allowed to join this world, so if you’re accepted, enjoy the privilege and don’t abuse it!</p>
