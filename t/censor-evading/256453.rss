    <title>Censor Evading</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/censor-evading/256453</link>
    <description>I have noticed a lot of people evading the censors lately.  I would just like to warn all of you that from now on evading the censor will result in an instant moderation.  The only exception to this is if you have a good reason to do so.  If a site normally appears as &quot;google&quot; when you post it, do not look for ways to get around that, the site has more than likely been censored for a good reason.  Also, if you see someone evading the censor, please report it.

Edit: Do not test the patience of a moderator. Any exception to this temporary rule will be judged at the discretion of the moderator. Continual ignorance of this rule will result in a ban. The censored websites are not being added to the censor list so that you can evade them. Get with the picture or get out.</description>
