<p>You are so off base on that I don’t know where to begin.</p>
<p>For one, presidents usually do what their advisors tell them to. A woman would do the same as a man if their advisors told them the same thing. We went to war over the suspicion of WMDs, not because we wanted to “OMFG THRS OIL LTS TK IT!!!”.</p>

</aside>
<p>You have no idea what you are talking about.</p>
<p>Bush became president in 2000. The current year is 2007. He won the election for a second term of four years in 2004. Thus his second term is over in 2008 (next year). He can’t run for more then two terms of office (not like he would win with an approval rating of 29-35%).</p>
<p>I prefer Biden and Edwards because they are “straight” talkers.Basically they get right to the point and actually express their opinions in a smart fashion, unlike the other political “robots” out there.</p>
<p>Hillery Clinton is a democrat. George W. Bush is a republican. They can’t run with each other, only against each other (which isn’t possible now since Bush is finishing up his second term).<br>
Even if Hillery were to become president and then decided not to run for a second term, the vice president doesn’t take power. New candidates are chosen and elected from that process.</p>

[/quote] vice prez can take power in the middle of a term[/quote]<br>
A presidential term in the United States of America = four years.</p>
<p>Now it is true that the Vice President can take power in the middle of a presidential term, but only if the acting president is rendered incapable to lead (death, mental illness, hostage situation or many other possibilities).<br>
But you said that Bush would be the Vice President to Hillary, which would never happen unless Bush was to switch political parties and gain a huge approval rating within the next year (extremely unlikely).</p>

Osama isn’t in Iraq…[/quote]The united states did research who was behind 911, and it took several weeks, it wasn’t an immediate attack.<br>
We found out it was alkahda (SP?) which had been lead by Osama bin laden, so we attack AFGHANISTAN. This has nothing to do with Iraq. We invaded Iraq because there was evidence of WMDs. Fortunately there turned out to be none and there was nothing to worry about, but like hypocrite said, </p><blockquote>People would hate Bush if we didn’t go over and they actually DID have weapons.</blockquote>
<p>However, I’m not defending Bush at all, I think he’s a war hungry, corrupt piece of shit, along with everyone involved in the Bush Administration.</p>
