    <title>[TUT]python in depth</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-python-in-depth/2440</link>
    <description>Okai for all of oyu who ahave a hard time understanding java heres a language that has all of the same funcionality and none of the hassle, Python!
here are a few tutorials for you to get started none of hem are scripting related their just good python tutorials to get you started.
first off if u dont already have it grab a copy of activestate python
just google it or look in my other python tut for a link.

now for the tuts: [url=http://honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut/easytut/]http://honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut/easytut/[/url] this is a great tutorial if you just want a quick crash course to get the feel of things
[url=http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html]http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html[/url] this tut here is more for people who want to know alot about python and have some time on their hand although it is a little less understandable
i highly recommend it over the other one

The information inside those tutorials will aid you in the creation of your scripts BUT you will need MODULES to cover the things that you cannot do with python as is (packet monitoring and such)

here is a link to a list of modules it has almost ALL of the modules out their [url=http://docs.python.org/modindex.html]http://docs.python.org/modindex.html[/url]
 so enjoy and i hope that some of us make the switch to python because script production could probably double :) oh and can you guys please tell me if you found this useful or not


edit: i dont now how many of you are on linux probably none but anyways heres a link to a linux python module for monitoring packets
[url=http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy]http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy[/url]

Edit: yay i found you guys a windows version of the packet capturer although you guys will have to figure it out on your own but it shouldnt be to hard[url=http://monkey.org/~dugsong/pypcap/]http://monkey.org/~dugsong/pypcap/[/url]


Edit: j python to java converter can be found here [url=http://www.jython.org]www.jython.org[/url] but your on your own when using it seeing as i havent figured it out all the way myself lol</description>

              <p>okai i will post a link to the convertor in a second but if you dont want to go through the trouble of converting you can also make a python script into a standalone app using py2exe wich could be useful as well</p>

<p>Edit you already posted the link lol jython is the converter <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
