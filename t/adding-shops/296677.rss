    <title>Adding shops :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-shops/296677</link>
    <description>Ok so i found shops.cfg, i can&#39;t seem to access .cfg files so i changed it into a .txt file, i added a shop name tabbed and stuff, but where would i find the shop ingame because there was nothing that said x/y coords?&#39;

Also, how/if i can, can i access cfg files anywaY? or do i not need to convert this txt file back to cfg?

This is what i added
shop = 1	Test						1	1	1	1</description>

WanneShop = 30; //Aubury Magic Shop</p>
<p>Ok lemme rephrase it</p>
<p>I make a shop with<br>
shop = 1	Testrunes					1	1	1	1<br>
in shops .cfg</p>
<p>(Shop id      Name                                       Sell  Buy  Item Amount)</p>
<p>That would mean shop id 1 which i would put as</p>
<p>WanneShop=1; //Testrunes?</p>
<p>If not can you explain,</p>
<p>Also 1 1 1 1 would mean it would?</p>
<p>Sell 1 item        Buy 1 item             Item ID then amount of that item?</p>
