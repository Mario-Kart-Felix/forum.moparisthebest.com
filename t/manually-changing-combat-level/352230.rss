    <title>Manually Changing Combat Level?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/manually-changing-combat-level/352230</link>
    <description>Ok im starting to work on a 525 and being the owner, I want to increase my level beyond the 138 max, and there is no option to manually do that in the &quot;savedgames&quot; folder where u can edit characters. I was wondering is there a way to manually increase my max level? It doesn&#39;t matter if it just looks higher or if i raise my stats above everyone but I want it to be only for me. Please help!</description>
