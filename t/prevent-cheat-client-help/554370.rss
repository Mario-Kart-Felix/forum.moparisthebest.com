<p>Create a UID for your Client (Signlink.java already has the code for it, just change it’s value).<br>
Then in the server, only allow connections from clients with a matching UID.</p>
<p>This is your first <span class="bbcode-u">layer</span> of defense. It’s easy to find the UID, but it will make it so the greater portion of skiddies that use cheat clients unable to connect.</p>
<p>From there, you need to figure out how they managed to give themselves the rights to spawn/etc. Either that, or you need to fix the commands so only staff can use them. A big issue people have had in the past is the ‘changepassword’ command, when left unfiltered, can make it so players can give themselves admin rights. I’d assume this is what that fellow did. You <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> have command logs, see if there’s a really long change password command string by the person “ruining” your server.</p>
