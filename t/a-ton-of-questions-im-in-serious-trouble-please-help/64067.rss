    <title>A ton of questions, im in serious trouble. Please help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-ton-of-questions-im-in-serious-trouble-please-help/64067</link>
    <description>Well here it goes... I downloaded a few sources like pimpscape, testscape, etc. I played them by myself did a little editing and stuff you know, just playing around with it. The one I chose is pimpscape. Then I decided that I would like to host it. So I searched around on here looking for anything that could help me when I came across Mod Taharok guide called [i]Ultimate Server Guide[/i] which can be found at this link: [glow=red,2,300][url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,37596.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,37596.0.html[/url][/glow]. I did all of the steps except this part in chapter 1:

&quot;Now we will need to make the rule for your router, by doing this you need to go into your router. You can do this by going into Internet Explorer (or whatever client you use for the Internet), and then type in the IP address of the router. Now log into the router and go into &quot;advanced&quot; (at top of screen on mine). Then on the sidebar to the left click the &quot;gaming&quot; button (is only left side for me...) Then you need to make a new rule and fill in the blanks with this information&quot;

I could not do that because of My first ploblem. My first problem is that I cannot acess my router firewall through the internet. Now dont say username : admin / password : admin , because I already did that and it did not work so that is my first problem. I spent about 2 days tying to figure that out but I obviously didnt since im asking for help. So I skipped that part and went on. I downloaded everything needed then I skipped chapters 2-5 and went on to the No-ip part and did all of that. Now im at my second problem. I did all of the editing in the compile.bat and runserve.bat. Before that I did enviromental properties thing. Then I opened up my MoparScape 3.2 w/ Aryan. Then I opened the Compiler for pimpscape and it said this exactly:

Note: Stream.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
Press any key to continue . . .

and then when I opened Runserver is said this exactly:

&#39;java&#39; is not recognized as an internal or extrernal command,
operable program or batch file.
Press any key to continue . . .




If anyone at all can help me please do, I would highly appreciate it like no other. This means alot to me..</description>

              <p>Use my Perfect Compiler which can be found all over the forums. Since you are compiling, and since you probably have played RuneScape, you do not need to download anything more when you use my Compiler.</p>
<p>To access your router, open up cmd (command prompt) and type in ‘ipconfig’. Now, the ‘default gateway’ is the IP address of your router. The ‘IP address’ is your computer IP address. After you have come across the login screen for your router, use any variations of the following usernames and passwords:</p>
<p>Username: admin</p>
<p>Username: administrator</p>
<p>Password: 12345</p>
<p>Password: 1234</p>
<p>If it still does not work, try logging in with any of those usernames, but with no password. After you have logged into your router, here is an excellent guide on Port Forwarding (you have to choose your router type before continuing to that specific Port Forwarding tutorial):</p>
