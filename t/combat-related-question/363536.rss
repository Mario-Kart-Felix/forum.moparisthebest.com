    <title>Combat related question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/combat-related-question/363536</link>
    <description>Ok sooo, the other day I thought about a private server i had played back in like 2004-2005, it was called justascape, dude that owned it was meiscooldude I think... Anyways I was fooling around and thought it would be cool to have the combat system just like it was on there. The combat system he had was that every time you clicked ur opponent you would attack them. Sounds very sloppy and un-updated I know, but I just wanted to try it out, could anyone tell me what files I have to edit and maybe how to go about doing it? Any help would be appreciated.</description>
