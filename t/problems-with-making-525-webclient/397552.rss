    <title>Problems with making 525 webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-making-525-webclient/397552</link>
    <description>OK well the subject doesnt tell the whole story.
The whole story is: I got a source and a client..... I got a jar maker and made the client..... 
The problems: As I have seen in the other tuts for 525 they tell me to look in class73 to take out a code for the window frame.... yet I have nothing in it about that or (if im messed up on details) the so called &quot;client ip&quot; is supposed to be in it which it isnt.
I have checked most other places for ip and nothing comes up. Although I have changed the ip in 2 other docs were it is correct but when I compile it seems to work because I have no errors but it still will not work
Also, it tells me in the tut to put my manifest as client2 which I do not have in either my source or my client folder.

If you any other details if I missed please tell me and I will add
Thank you for your time
OH and tell me if in wrong section, I will gladly move it</description>
