              <p>BETA was set to release a few days ago; however, we have run into a few problems that have each taken a few hours to fix. I also encountered a client issue today due to getting my official client and backups mixed up, but it is fixed now.

<p>OT:<br>
Today I worked on Mining while MajorPro had great progress on Farming.</p>
<p>Mining:</p>
<p>[ul][li]If you have more than one pickaxe, it will choose the best pickaxe when mining (if you can wield it).[/li]<br>
[li]You no longer have to equip a pickaxe to mine ores.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Farming:</p>
<p>[ul][li]The only current patch location that is supported is the one located in Catherby. MajorPro will most likely finish up the other locations tomorrow.[/li]<br>
[li]There is a unique timer when planting herbs. Over the process of a set time scale, the herb will increase in size (as on RS) until it has reached the maximum size and is pickable.[/li]<br>
[li]Patches now reset once you have picked the herbs.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I now have a job which means I can’t complete as many updates as I would like; however, I will still try my best to get at least one update posted here everyday. Tomorrow I’m probably going to start working on another skill.</p>
<p>Also, I’m looking for a client and web developer. Once we have gotten those positions filled, we will have a complete team and be ready for the BETA release soon. If you are interested in either position, please, feel free to post.  ;D</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback, but I recently switched to an old school base. The base is still Project Insanity, but I yet to understand how it cannot be different and new with a little effort. The true reason why developers actually choose a base is because they are comfortable with it. Yes, the base might be overused, but you shouldn’t blame the source for the output, but the developer.</p>

<p>No, I blame the base and the developer.</p>

<p>I’m sorry you feel that way, but in all honesty it seems like you have a little to much ignorance, no offense.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have been in the RSPS “business” for over 2 years.  I know what is new and what is not; i’m not being ignorant, i’m just telling you the truth 100%.  The base matters the most because the original authors know where the stability fixes are, and they would know the most efficient way to go about fixing it without messing up anything else since they are the ones who wrote it and know the server in and out.  Personally, I know the fixes and the sources down to each line of code.<br>

              <p>That’s great for you, but from what you are saying, every source is to blame. Why, you may ask? Well its true that the author of that source knows the source itself inside and out and know how to make it as efficient as possible. I did not mean to show any disrespect, but you can’t just blame one base without blaming the others, also.</p>
