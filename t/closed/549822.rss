I’m only giving you advice when I say this, so please take no personal offence. Maybe you should consider the following:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Your layout for this thread is absolutely horrible, which makes it more likely to attract people with bad intentions.[/li]<br>
[li]While it is definitely good to see someone that is willing to aspire as a programmer in RS2 emulation, I can accurately promise this project will be very difficult if you have very little knowledge with the programming language of the source. I would highly recommend that you look into the inner workings of the language itself before trying to launch a project.[/li]<br>
[li]It is very apparent that your grammar is either lacking or you have just failed to put effort into it.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, this is not meant to offend you; however, I would like you to consider it as criticism.[/quote]</p>
