YOU sir are a dip shit, stop posting on here for no reason just to be a asshole because you’re just adding to your shit post count. Yes, I agree server help is for people who got errors AND people who need help finding guides again, hence “SERVER HELP” are you that stupid or just illiterate? Read the description, “Got a tricky problem to solve? Ask your question and someone may be able to resolve it.” This isn’t only for errors.[/quote]No you’re the only dip shit here, why would i need more post count<br>
? i dont give a fucking piglet if i am a junior, a member a senior whatever, and i haven’t said anything offensive yet, your taking the criticsm so fucking rough, its not my problem that you can’t use the search bar properly, a tutorial to use moparscape should be made wait not moparscape, just the fcking search bar so you stop creating stupid topics.</p>
<p>And we’re not flaming, we’re just trying to teach you how to use the website.</p>

This is all considered spam, you aren't following guidelines I don't need help anymore, why post? you're just bumping this thread over and over. Good-bye.
