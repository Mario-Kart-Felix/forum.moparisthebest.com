He killed his best friend so he could get mod because his friend was going to get it or something :s[/quote]</p>
<p>The truth is,</p>
<pre><code>It was just over a year ago. I can still remember that day. Such a cold, sad day. You see, we used to have a moderator named Ownager3. He was a great moderator, and most peoples favorite. He was just recently promoted to global moderator. You see, Ikiliki was also a moderator. They knew each other in real life, and would often hang out and were just generally friends. They were out driving when Ikiliki got into a car accident. Not your typical accident, an extremely critical one. It took place on a bridge and the car flew into the sea below. Ikiliki quickly got out and Ownager3 was dorwning. He could've saved Ownager3, but greed overtook him. He knew if Ownager3 was gone, he would be the favorite. He would be the new global moderator. And so, he fled form the car and ran away, leaving Ownager3 to die.

People becan to notice Ownager3 was not visiting the forum. Ikiliki just told them he was having real-life problems. Until a member here, named Niall, decided to look him up and see if he could get into contact with him. That's when he stumbled across an article detailing the horrendous crash. There it was, Ikiliki and Ownager3's names. Jon, Ownager3's first name, had drowned. Mircaulously, Ikiliki had escaped. The article included an interview where Hank (Ikiliki) had told that he had tried desperately to get Jon out, but failed. Niall confronted Ikiliki, and asked about it. Strangely, Ikiliki cracked. He told Niall the whole story. About how he had placed a forum position before a friend's life. Niall was outraged and banned Ikiliki.

The story is still secret, and this post is against the rules. Niall will most likely ban me for this post, but I feel it's needed.

I believe it was released, as there is a largely popular base called rune-server over there. iirc it had you as an author to one of the classes I was looking at… I guess a lot of people contributed to it or whatever, peterbjornx wrote a embeddable language for it called runescript, graham wrote the combat with some guy named scu11 and everyone over there rages it is the best combat. Also believe it was originally hyperion.</p>
<p>Was phate and/or keven ever a member of MITB/Kaitnieks?[/quote]Phate was, Kevin wasn’t from what I’ve heard. Originally there was an R-S private server, which had basic fletching and I believe only PvM combat or something ridiculous. Then the “Official R-S private server” came out, with devs such as Graham, Peter, Scu, and a couple of others.</p>

<p>Wait I thought the rule was if you use both accounts. If you quit your old account and create a new account then it’s not really account breaking. That’s what I was told o_o</p>

<p>My old account, Paradox, I forgot the password to. That’s why I have this account lmao. I made Paradox back in 2006, but then I used R-S and stuff then eventually came back here as this. Although, anyone who does know me will know me as Ruby and not Paradox. So I don’t believe that this is against the rules seeing as I forgot my stuff for the other account.<br>

Oh so your paradox_ on rune-server  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">  :|[/quote]<br>
Nah, I’m “` Ruby”. I was “Paradox” on R-S too, I quit RSPS for a while to go into serious website development projects, eventually returning around this time two years ago under the name of Ruby, unfortunately Ruby was taken on here and at the time I was still a kid, so I made “Ruby Forums Coder” which is literally the worst name on mopar, lol.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks to Taharok and Frell, I got my name changed.</p>
