<p>I believe it was released, as there is a largely popular base called rune-server over there. iirc it had you as an author to one of the classes I was looking at… I guess a lot of people contributed to it or whatever, peterbjornx wrote a embeddable language for it called runescript, graham wrote the combat with some guy named scu11 and everyone over there rages it is the best combat. Also believe it was originally hyperion.</p>

<p>Was phate and/or keven ever a member of MITB/Kaitnieks?[/quote]Phate was, Kevin wasn’t from what I’ve heard. Originally there was an R-S private server, which had basic fletching and I believe only PvM combat or something ridiculous. Then the “Official R-S private server” came out, with devs such as Graham, Peter, Scu, and a couple of others.</p>

[/quote]<br>
He killed his best friend so he could get mod because his friend was going to get it or something :s[/quote]</p>
<p>The truth is,</p>
<pre><code>It was just over a year ago. I can still remember that day. Such a cold, sad day. You see, we used to have a moderator named Ownager3. He was a great moderator, and most peoples favorite. He was just recently promoted to global moderator. You see, Ikiliki was also a moderator. They knew each other in real life, and would often hang out and were just generally friends. They were out driving when Ikiliki got into a car accident. Not your typical accident, an extremely critical one. It took place on a bridge and the car flew into the sea below. Ikiliki quickly got out and Ownager3 was dorwning. He could've saved Ownager3, but greed overtook him. He knew if Ownager3 was gone, he would be the favorite. He would be the new global moderator. And so, he fled form the car and ran away, leaving Ownager3 to die.

People becan to notice Ownager3 was not visiting the forum. Ikiliki just told them he was having real-life problems. Until a member here, named Niall, decided to look him up and see if he could get into contact with him. That's when he stumbled across an article detailing the horrendous crash. There it was, Ikiliki and Ownager3's names. Jon, Ownager3's first name, had drowned. Mircaulously, Ikiliki had escaped. The article included an interview where Hank (Ikiliki) had told that he had tried desperately to get Jon out, but failed. Niall confronted Ikiliki, and asked about it. Strangely, Ikiliki cracked. He told Niall the whole story. About how he had placed a forum position before a friend's life. Niall was outraged and banned Ikiliki.

The story is still secret, and this post is against the rules. Niall will most likely ban me for this post, but I feel it's needed.

        <p>If anyone is curious, here’s Ikiliki’s retelling of it all. I’m not saying it’s correct, or incorrect. I’m merely posting it for the sake of sharing information. Personally, i don’t really care too much about who leaves or who stays and what communities branch off.</p>
<blockquote>Don't forget; there's a difference between google and MITB. MITB is just a forum, while the google forum is just a simple "extra" addition to the website. Everything started with a forum though, obviously branched off MITB and some others.
<p>I didn’t leave MITB by myself, I was banned by one of the Global Moderators. I still don’t know the exact reason of the ban, but it all started over some IRC drama. Lothy (if I remember the name correctly?) and frank_ told me it had something to do with IRC ban-evading and my skin color. Pretty strange, but I don’t really mind.</p>
<p>I had google before the ban, but I wasn’t really planning on running it any longer. I was just running the site to test someone’s skills and learn some about webdeveloping. After my ban I’ve decided to continue the development though. Everything over here is based off my suggestions to MITB back in the time, he just disliked them, believed nobody would like it and therefore refused developing the things I suggested. He wasn’t the only one, many of these oldskool MITB members agreed with him and told me google would die within a week.</p>
<p>Within a week?! We grew each day, and hey, look at google right now. Traffic-wise we’re the largest RuneScape private server website. According to my personal Google manager (google is one of the Adsense Premium users due to all the traffic) we received more than a double of MITB’s traffic in nov. 2011. Because of all the recent RS updates we’ve dropped some in traffic though, but that applies to any RSPS-related website.<br>
Looks like MITB realizes some of my suggestions were actually good, I just noticed he has added voting to his Server Status Page, something he has always disliked back in the time when I suggested it. This voting/toplist-thing is the main reason why we grew so much.</p>
