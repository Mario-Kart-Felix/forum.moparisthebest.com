    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;127 Hours is the true story of mountain climber Aron Ralston&#39;s remarkable adventure to save himself after a fallen boulder crashes on his arm and traps him in an isolated canyon in Utah. Over the next five days Ralston examines his life and survives the elements to finally discover he has the courage and the wherewithal to extricate himself by any means necessary, scale a 65 foot wall and hike over eight miles before he is finally rescued. Throughout his journey, Ralston recalls friends, lovers, family, and the two hikers he met before his accident. Will they be the last two people he ever had the chance to meet?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I felt really let down by this movie. I think Danny Boyle could of explored the state of his mind in a little more detail and thrilling ways. It was a decent enough movie to watch but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d ever watch it again. Just interested in hearing other peoples opinions on this movie.</description>

<p>You don’t. I haven’t seen it, but I don’t want to see it either. What’s the point of making a whole movie about a guy who basically sits there for 127 hours? A short movie would’ve been nice though. The story can be exiting, as long as it’s told in a max. of 30 minutes.</p>
