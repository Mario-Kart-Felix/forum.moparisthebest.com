    <description>Hey ok well I have tryed the search menu, and couldn&#39;t find many really helpful posts so I was wondering if any of you guys knew how I could get a price to the exact number I want because I noticed many are 162.29288273837 and all that stuff so, if anyone knows a simple way to make something the values they should be for example making a mime mask 5000 instead of coming out at 7534gp.

Ok thanks for any help I get!
