    <title>Can someone make me a very simple burier</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-make-me-a-very-simple-burier/110383</link>
    <description>OK, all i need is a script that i can run when i have a full inventory of bones that will bury them all, you might ask why i don&#39;t use &#39;bone picker and burier&#39; scripts but i have tried many and none of them seem to work for me. Also, i normally like to kill guards and pick up the bones as i go to get my combat levels up aswell.

I know this is a very simple script but i don&#39;t understand scripting and i don&#39;t have a hope in hell of writing my own, so i would really appreciate it if someone would make one for me. :D</description>

              <p>I can’t seem to find that folder, but, i have now learnt how to write scripts (it’s easier than i first thought) so i am working on my own bone burier, i have already created a script that logs you right in from the <a href="http://runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runescape.com</a> main menu (i know it’s simple, but i’m proud of it)  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>If its just for burying bones, edit the DropAll procedure in the SRL folder to drop the items instead, that would probably work.</p>
<p>But whats better is to make a DTM of the bones and tell it to clic kthe DTM and wait, not that confusing heh.  Or just copy and paste a pre-made DTM of a boen from a different script.</p>
