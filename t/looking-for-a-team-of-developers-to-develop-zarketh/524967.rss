Since Zarketh has been up we&#39;ve been swapping sources sources, each time finding it&#39;s [B]utterly[/B] useless. Below are the servers we&#39;ve been through

[B][I]1) [COLOR=#ff9900]Cant remember which it was.. (was released)[/COLOR]
2) [COLOR=#ff6600]Ventrix[/COLOR]
3) [COLOR=#ff3300]Interbellum[/COLOR]
4)[COLOR=#ff0000] Zanaris[/COLOR][/I][/B]


[SIZE=2][FONT=Verdana]I believe that Zarketh will have high potential if i get a coder which knows what he&#39;s doing to code me a custom server to my liking, which is bugless zarketh could have the opportunity, finally to thrive. I have plans to make this one of the biggest servers, so far i&#39;ve re-invested my money back into the server only taking a little for myself, sometimes using the money on useless things, for example paying for work on a released server. Sometimes for things which were necessary like a donation system made by Shaq from Rune-server[/FONT][/SIZE]

[B][SIZE=4][COLOR=&quot;#00FF00&quot;]Some examples of  content wanted[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
[B]Some things which would be in the server i&#39;d like made
i) Realistic bosses, coded with phases, including nex.
ii) Full screen
iii) Stable economy[/B]

[B][COLOR=&quot;#00FF00&quot;][SIZE=3]Payment[/SIZE]
[/COLOR][/B]
[B]You may ask, &quot;What will i get out of this? &quot;
Well, i&#39;ve thought of different methods you might be interested.
i) Payment for the WHOLE job, this means you will code it till it&#39;s ready to be hosted, i understand this isnt a days job.
ii) I will NOT pay per hour.
iii) We can arrange you to become a coder for Zarketh for the future.
iiii) A percentage of donations could come to you.
[/B]

[B][SIZE=3][COLOR=&quot;#00FF00&quot;]Questions

[B]Q)Percentage of donations? You won&#39;t earn alot.
