    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-people-go-on-your-server/91381</link>
    <description>[b]Ok I tried to make it as simple as possible for you guys[/b]  :cool:

[u]First thing&#39;s 1st[/u]

[ul][li]Go to www.no-ip.com and register with them and sign in, Now logg in. [/li]
[li]Now on the left hand side there is a heading called [u]Hosts/Redirect[/u], under that click add.[/li][/ul]


[IMG]http://i176.photobucket.com/albums/w163/xxm00nshinexx/No-ip.jpg[/img]

Ok so once you have clicked add, you shoud end up with this page:

[IMG]http://i176.photobucket.com/albums/w163/xxm00nshinexx/no-ip2.jpg[/img]

Now enter what you want people to put in to access your server. For me i have put &quot;tutscape&quot; Then the box below it as things to put on the end for example &quot;no-ip.info&quot; &amp; &quot;no-ip.org&quot; You can choose any you want. now leave the rest, well thats what i did. Now go down to the bottom and click create host.

After this download the no-ip program, skip this step if you already have it!!!!  there is a tab at the top that says download, click it, find what operating system your on and download it.

Now, when you start it a little no-ip symbol is in your toolbar at the bottom. Double click the icon and you should eng up with this.

[IMG]http://i176.photobucket.com/albums/w163/xxm00nshinexx/no-ip3.jpg[/img]

Now IGNORE THE SPARKLESCAPE.NO-IP.ORG THATS JUST ONE THAT I CREATED FOR MY SERVER!!! (by the way it isnt up yet lol) now click check the box at the side of your i.p that you have created, when you do this it updates it ( i just leave it clicked ) better :cool:
So now to open your server :) then when you go to log on DO NOT USE THE I-P YOU JUST CREATED use the default &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; or you can put &quot;0.0.0.0&quot; or &quot;localhost&quot;  it will not work if you put the i-p you just created, i have no idea why, im just telling you what i have done Hehe.
[b]ONLY OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO GET ON BY USING YOU NO-IP THAT YOU HAVE CREATED!!!!
Post your no-ip on moparscapes serverstatus and there you go, log on to your server (dont use the no-ip to log on, that is just for other people)[/b]
Now wait for people to log in ^_^ hope this as helped some peopel :)</description>
