    <title>Code that keep track of players mob kills, and more</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/code-that-keep-track-of-players-mob-kills-and-more/259287</link>
    <description>I&#39;m wondering if anyone wants to put some time together and make a code that can do this. 
Its not needed but its cool additions. 
Such as seeing ho far you&#39;ve walked over all or how many mobs you&#39;ve killed. 
Another idea is spells casted or arrows shot.

Well, I&#39;m just throwing this idea out there. 
I&#39;d love to have it, but it would be an interesting addition the the forum code snippet section thing.</description>
