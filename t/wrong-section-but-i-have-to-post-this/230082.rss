    <description>Well, Ever since i have started working on 503s (Some of you know bout it , its called ploxage 503: http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,298939.0.html), Jagex has slowly started taking me down.

Step 1 - Deleting Videos Off Youtube....

Here is the AMOUNT Of Videos Left (WE HAD ABOUT 200+)

All i have left is the 503... This might not be looking 2 good :( :blink:

Jagex Is Scared of people with 503&#39;s\508&#39;s, And if they starting paying attention to me so fast.. i think they are starting to find out bout other servers so this could ruin alot of communities like roon server etc.

I know this isnt the right section But i have to get your guys opinions on whats going on..

Like seriously, Jagex has already closed down frugooscape cuz of their 503 webclient so lets hear some opinions
