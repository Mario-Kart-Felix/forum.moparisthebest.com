    <title>Help with Port Forwarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-port-forwarding/477785</link>
    <description>I have port forwarded many times before. But this time I am getting problems. For anyone&#39;s information I have a Linksys WRT110 Router. I have everything entered correctly. But when I go to check the ports or log into my server. It is not online nor are the ports open. If I could please get some assistance. I&#39;ve been going at it all day and to be honest. It is frustrating me to the max. Sorry to ask for such help. But if you could I would much appreciate it. Thank you.

PS. If we need to go on teamviewer. I am willing.</description>
