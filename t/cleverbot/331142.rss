<p>User: Yeah, haha. So how does Cleverbot work…?</p>
<p>Cleverbot: I think it takes and takes and takes, and sometimes relates, and relates and relates.</p>
<p>User: Yeah, that seems plausible. It probably learns new phrases from others’ comments toward it, right?</p>
<p>Cleverbot: You’re saying I’m a computer?</p>
<p>User: Well, I’m guessing you are. :).</p>
<p>Cleverbot: Nope. I’m pretty young.</p>

<p>Cleverbot: Take care.</p>
<p>User: Bye!</p>
<p>Cleverbot: Bye - where are you going?</p>

<p>Cleverbot: What are you studying?</p>
