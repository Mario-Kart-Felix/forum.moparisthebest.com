    <description>ok well everytime i use my crystal bow apparently it takes 5 seconds for it to attack as it does the gfx
i dont want it to do that
i want it to make a perfect arrow drawback
how do i change how the c bow shoots arrows?

as you can see the gfx is getting ready to shoot the arrow but then the gfx keeps repeating the gfx animation so that means there is no arrow in the air its just before the drawback
i dont know how to fix this help please 
thanks</description>
