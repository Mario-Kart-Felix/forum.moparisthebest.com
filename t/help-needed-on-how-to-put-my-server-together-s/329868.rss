              <p>btw you’re not blaccking out your ip address pretty good seeing as i can read it.</p>
<p>as for the client, you don’t use the no-ip for youself, you just use onf of the following:<br>
localhost<br>
127.0.0.1<br>
0.0.0.0<br>
192.100.0.102</p>
<p>well just use those and then try logging in. should work really…</p>
