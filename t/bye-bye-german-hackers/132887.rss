    <title>Bye, Bye German Hackers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bye-bye-german-hackers/132887</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[img]http://www.makezine.com/blog/1082549438_e9c8607304.jpg[/img]
Today in Germany the Hacker Tool Law goes into effect. With the official name of Paragraph 202C it states that it is illegal to possess, use, produce, or distribute a &quot;hacker tool&quot;.

In theory, law enforcement could come and arrest everyone here at Chaos Communications Camp. A group of hackers gathered in solidarity to protest this law. Hackers in Germany have been protesting the making of this law for the past year and are stunned that it passed and has gone into effect.

The term &quot;hacker tool&quot; is left vague. Nmap or other network monitoring system could fall into this category. Software likeKismac, a wifi detection software, closed down today. Phenoelit, a hacker group, also closed down shop and saying goodbye to Germany.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I guess hackers theoretically could just not use &quot;tools&quot; and stick with old school &#39;hacking&#39;.</description>

              <p>Erm, this is fucking stupid. The tools that hackers use are the exact same tools that admins use. For example, nmap - used by sysadmins worldwide, also used to break into systems worldwide. (Also used by Trinity in the Matrix 2… to hack :p)</p>
<p>Next we’ll be banning knives - we won’t be able to cut up our dinner anymore, but at least there might be less stabbings!</p>

Seriously, this law is nothing but an epic failure. It does not stop the crackers, but most likely will kill the white hat scene in Germany.<br>
