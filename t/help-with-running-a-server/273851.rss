    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-running-a-server/273851</link>
    <description>Hello,

 I have been trying to make a server. I got to the part where you run it. I have 1 error.

Error 1: When i click run server it says &quot;Java is not known as an internal or external command&quot;... Please help!

Also, if you know of a good source i can run on mopar, just a basic server source, please tell me the source.


Thanks so much!  :)</description>
