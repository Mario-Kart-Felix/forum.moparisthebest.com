    <title>Who would you rather be President (Choose Anyone)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-would-you-rather-be-president-choose-anyone/455194</link>
    <description>Offer who you&#39;d rather have to be president of the united states government. There&#39;s two rules: 1. Take it at least somewhat seriously. 2. Romney and Obama need to be left out as choices since obv. they are in the elections. This is about people who you&#39;d rather be in the election right now.

Why do you feel this person should be president and what do you think this person would do if president. I will list who i feel are winners in a poll i will post afterwards.

My choice? I feel that Gary Johnson would be a generic choice. I just want a 3rd party candidate I loved the way he ran things in new mexico (i lived in Taos and Roswell while he was governor).</description>

              <p>I have mixed feelings. I’m fine with the video for the same reason I’d be fine with a video against Christians, homosexuals, black people, white people, Europeans etc. being up. I’m fine with the video being up because I’m not one who thinks Muslims should be treated with kiddie gloves. On the other hand there has been some clear tension with some members of the Muslim world in the past decade which makes me think this video is in bad taste and does nothing but to incite violence and riots. That’s not to say I’m against free speech about any topics regarding Muslims, but there’s a clear line between having arguments and criticism against Islam, and films with no clear purpose other than to provoke a group when tensions are already high.</p>
<p>At the end of the day though, riots and protests are already happening and regardless or not if the film is removed, thanks to copycat behaviour I doubt the riots or protests will subside any quicker.</p>

<p>YT  is just trying to score some cheap points here. They cannot claim they stand for freedom of speech, as countless examples in the past shown a less free speech friendly practise.</p>
<p>I don’t know if you guys would agree, but that film should get removed. It is not criticism but slander. You cannot claim that Muslims do not distance itself from the film either. The biggest Muslim organisation in Norway: Islam Net, do oppose any demonstration. Their reasoning is that the film’s intent is trick Muslims into a violent response.</p>
