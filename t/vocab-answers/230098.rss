    <description>My school uses Sadlier-Oxford for a vocabulary book and i came across a site that helped me a lot these past few years. It gives you Version 1996 and 2002, which should be up to date still. they are with me at least, just check you&#39;re book. All of the Levels and units are listed there for you. You can use this for checking purposes or just plain out copying I guess. The site makes it sound like more of a &quot;check and help&quot; reference rather than a cheating one.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[center][size=12pt][b]What is VocabCheck and why is it here?[/b][/size]
The purpose of this website is for students which use Sadlier-Oxford&#39;s line of Vocabulary Workbooks, to be able to check their answers before having them checked at school.
[size=12pt][b]
Why check my answers now if I will check them at school?[/b][/size]
We have found that many students don&#39;t have the opportunity to check their answers at school, then go back home and study.  Some teachers check the answers and then immediately thereafter issue the test.  VocabCheck thinks this practice is unfair to students and inhibits their learning abilities.  By checking your answers before class you have the advantage of knowing your answers are correct.[/center]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hope it helps.

Woah! And then you just read the description under all the links and you could figure it out from there.<br>
If not then just click on one of the links. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
