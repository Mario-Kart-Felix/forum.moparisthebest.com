    <description>I have a completely new source and client in which i&#39;m using this time and i must say, it looks promising. Its a 404 Revision but its very smooth and even my crappy HP 2000 Notebook laptop can run it with ease and I&#39;ve put this thing through hell to say the least. Anyways, i&#39;m going to invest the rest of my free time besides working and keeping my girlfriend off my ass to fixing up home, adding all the teleports, closing off areas or opening them up, fixing bosses, fixing drops and drop rates, xp rates, shops, cities, pk area, wildy, and possibly a secondary home for players who don&#39;t like my Yanille setup because i know its not a preference for some odd reason. I&#39;ve always loved it but its probably because of my Dodian Nostalgia. So, let&#39;s cut to the chase; I need help with 3 things. 1) This PI has some sort of inner-city PK bullshit that i want gone. When youre in varrock, fally, or ardy it skulls you and allows players to pk. I want it to be friendly. 2) My skillcape guy is set as wise old man. If i go up to him with no money in my inventory he stops, drops, and opens up shop like its nothin. If i hve any form of money in my inventory however and i click him, he crashes my client and i need to relog. 3) How do i disable the ability to put money in your pouch? Its bugged to where if i put cash in there, theres no icon to withdraw it back so its lost forever and just disabling the deposit feature would fix it easier. I know i don&#39;t have too many eyes watching this post but for the ones i do, maybe you can help. Thanks  ;D

              <p>Wow that’s a mouthful of text for so very little useful information.<br>
Cool you’re trying to dedicate yourself to rsps, but we really didn’t need (No offence: nor do we care) to know.</p>
<p>For <span class="hashtag">#1</span>) Just go into the inWild() code and delete the if statements for the cities you don’t want to have pk in. Also go in the process() method in client.java and remove the code that adds the attack options as well.</p>
<p>For <span class="hashtag">#2</span>) Your shop is clearly bugged, I’d have to see all the code related to it opening. (Starting in ActionHandler, and the rest being in ShopAssistant)</p>
<p>For <span class="hashtag">#3</span>) Disable the packet server sided. The “Add to pouch” option on coins is set in the client, but only works because the server tells it to do what it does. Just find the code in First/Second item click and remove it.</p>
