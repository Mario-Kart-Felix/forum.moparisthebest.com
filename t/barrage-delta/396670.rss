    <description>How to fix barrage timing &quot;DELTA&quot;

    Hi, i am having some trouble with my barraging atm. During pking player vs player, when i freeze them and far cast i can constantly keep clicking barrage on them. Every time i do my character runs towards them, and my barrage is slow because every time i cast the spell i have to wait 10secs or so before casting again properly.



    Hope i can get help, Ty for your time.</description>
