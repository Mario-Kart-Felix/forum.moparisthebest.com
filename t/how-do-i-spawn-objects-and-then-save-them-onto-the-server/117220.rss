    <title>How Do I Spawn Objects and then save them onto the server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-spawn-objects-and-then-save-them-onto-the-server/117220</link>
    <description>Hi i was wondering how i spawn objects or what the code is to do this.

I know the ID&#39;s but im unsure as to what the command for it is and if i need a code for it.

Then i would also like to know how to save them spawned objects to the server so they will stay there.

P.S this is not ::npc, ::pickup or ::pnpc i want to spawn and save objects like fountains, bookcases etc...

Thanks
