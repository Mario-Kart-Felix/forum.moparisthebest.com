 Franz Joseph I or Francis Joseph I (Franz Joseph Karl; 18 August 1830 – 21 November 1916) was Emperor of Austria along with his wife: Empress Elizabeth of Austria, Queen of Hungary. He was also King of Hungary, King of Bohemia, and monarch of many other states of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, from 2 December 1848 to his death. From 1 May 1850 to 24 August 1866 he was also President of the German Confederation. He was the longest-reigning Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, as well as the th</p>

I don’t like wikipeidia because at the top it has a “edit” botton, so then this means it could be false information, which I don’t want to take from there. The “edit” in wikipeidia is bad because anyone can click on it and edit and whatever they like in there.<br>

<p>They have many many moderators what watch all the edits, so <em>most</em> of the information there is correct.</p>
<p>Answers from this forum won’t be any more correct than ones you get from wikipedia anyway.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Franz Josef was Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s uncle, and the archduke’s assassination was the reason WWI started.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanky you cause now I know why he actually started the war, because my teacher said that he had started the war, but he didnt tell me why he did.</p>
