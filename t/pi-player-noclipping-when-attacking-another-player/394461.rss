    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-player-noclipping-when-attacking-another-player/394461</link>
    <description>hey guys, 
problem: i have been trying for a while to find out how to stop players no clipping through walls, fences &amp; houses when they click &#39;attack player&#39; on the other person behind the house, wall.
i went through alot of files in the source trying to find how to do this &amp; search a number of key words but no result.

example: if i was in wildy not attacking anyone and i clicked over the other side of the fence, it would go around it.
but if &#39;bob&#39; is on the other side of the fence and i click attack bob i will go right through the fence
other worlds he doesn&#39;t stop for nothing.

please help</description>
