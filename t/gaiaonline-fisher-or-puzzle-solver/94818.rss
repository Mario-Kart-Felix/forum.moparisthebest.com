    <description>Alright, puzzle solver [I[may[/I] be impossible. (But I would be VERY impressed if someone pulled it off!

Ok, so I am looking for an autofisher for gaiaonline. I have one and it catches the fish half the time, but it is outdated and doesn&#39;t work as well as it could. I don&#39;t have anything to give you but my gratitude in return.</description>
