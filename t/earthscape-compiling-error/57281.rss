    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/earthscape-compiling-error/57281</link>
    <description>I went To compile earthscape and it wouldn&#39;t work!   I did everything it said... AND IT DID&#39;NT WORK!!! 


On the readme it said:&lt;blockquote&gt;Go to the place where i posted this attachment and download the other
one called .file_store_32 ...it will not work untill you have got that
and placed it in a file called CACHE!

THEN compile all the java files.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So I put .file_store_32 in cache and then went to compile it...
This Message came:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;Compiling...
          The system cannot find the path specified.
           Compiling Completed!
           Press any key to continue&lt;/blockquote&gt;


WHAT IS WRONG WHIT IT PLZ HELP :eek: (soz if i posted this in the wrong place...)</description>
