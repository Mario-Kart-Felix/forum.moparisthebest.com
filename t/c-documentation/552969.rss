    <description>Since I&#39;m working as a student employee at an IT company I now have to document my code. Since this is the first time I have to document code I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m doing it right, I&#39;m not sure whether there are some specific rules to follow or not.

Is this piece of code well-documentated or not? If not, what could I do better?

One method should do one thing.</p>
<p>And what’s up with the error handling? Surely not being able to reach a service endpoint of some kind is exceptional behaviour that warrants not swallowing the exception.</p>

<p>Other than that, I really prefer Javadocs to C#-documentation.

              <p>That’s funny, I experienced the complete opposite in all of the places I worked after graduating. Maybe it’s supposed to be self-documenting…</p>
<p>One thing I would say is that you should try making your comments more concise and think about what another programmer would want to know at that level. For example, instead of “A bool to check if the transmission was successfull. False when flooding or when the Aucxis service is offline.”, maybe just “True if transmission was successful, otherwise false”. If the programmer needs to know this information it’s too much for a bool imo, and should be a more self-documenting return type.</p>
<p>I think naming should also be a bit more consistent? Doesn’t matter here so much, but I think in general it’s good to be more precise especially when you have more complex stuff it’s annoying for other people to work it all out. For example, the function is called “Send” but the comments refer to it as “passing”.</p>
<p>Other than that it seems pretty good - I can understand what the code is doing, and it goes into just the right about of detail… explaining things that aren’t immediately obvious by reading the code, and without going into detail about irrelevant shit that I could just work out myself if I really wanted to.</p>
