    <title>Looking for a partner</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-partner/526586</link>
    <description>So basically, this will sound strange, but I&#39;m looking for someone who can to all the technical work of the server while I deal with the finance and community side of the server so you wouldn&#39;t have to make any financial commitment. I am asking for this because I&#39;m fed up with playing 700+ cache servers which either have no community or a decent set of staff. So yeah, the server will be HD, a bit of a wilderness initiative, but mainly focused on bossing/skilling etc.
I would prefer the server to be a long term one, rather than everybody joins, spends £2 for a phat then leaves, because I&#39;m not in it for the money, I just want to create a good community which people can enjoy playing with
It&#39;s not going to be one of those servers where you can just get 99&#39;s like nothing, but it&#39;s not going to be piss hard either. 
I am looking for someone who is committed, enjoys the game and doesn&#39;t just copy and paste other peoples code. 
Feel free to add me on Skype: Nickldinho if you&#39;re interested :)</description>
