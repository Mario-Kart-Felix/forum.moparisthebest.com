    <title>Error_game_js5connect on 508 Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-game-js5connect-on-508-client/300705</link>
    <description>OK, I know several topics have been posted about this. But none of them helped me. I was following Tony&#39;s guide on how to set up a 508 HD server and I got up to the step where you run the server, when I tried running the server then client and I type in my IP (this usually happens when I type my IP), the client was stuck on &#39;Connecting to update server&#39;. I checked my No-IP and there was this face with red cheeks lol. I also tried portforwarding and I have a wireless router if that changes anything. If you can help me it would be appreciated =D.

Thanks</description>

<p>Don’t post multiple topics about this…<br>
Tony’s tutorial doesn’t work.<br>
It USED to.</p>
