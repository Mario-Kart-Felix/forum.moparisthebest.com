    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/charlie-sheen-aint-got-shit-on-this/392543</link>
    <description>I saw this on reddit the other day, and previously i&#39;ve always hated and despised this guy.

All I can say is, watched this interview and new found respect and appreciation for this guy.
He speaks at a million miles an hour with some profound and intelligent answers to the questions, and unlike Charlie Sheen he doesn&#39;t have to refer to &quot;winning&quot; all the time :P

He&#39;s so eccentric it seems as if he&#39;s coked up for the interview but I&#39;m pretty sure he isn&#39;t.</description>

<p>That quote, taken from youtube, pretty much sums up what my feelings on him were before and after this video.</p>

<p>No, like I said, wasn’t a big fan… but now I’ll certainly consider reading it.</p>
<p>He’s still got a very egotistic personality, but he knows it and I love his comparisons of celebrities as the modern day “prophets” replacing the religious types that people previously idolised. His desire for fame and success is a result of society, and now as a celebrity he hates and despises it, very amusing.</p>
