    <title>Crashing Runescape Server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crashing-runescape-server/64673</link>
    <description>I was thinking, that is it possible to crash Runescapes server/servers with a server crasher (designed for private servers) IF you&#39;d know their IP and port. So I used VisualRoute to find their IP it is 64.37.71.203 although the port is needed also. Don&#39;t know that will this work, will their firewall block it or something else. Try for yourself. If some &quot;mastermind&quot; figures this out, who knows what would happen? :| ServerCrasher is attached ( The creator of the server crasher is rs2crasher ).</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’d be inclined to say that the server was coded in C++, despite what pplsuqbawls will probably try to tell you. I think Andrew/other main coders personally prefer C as a programming language, looking at their code, they use very little Java API, and a lot of binary maths (yes I realise it’s a game and that’s going to happen, but it’s still pretty excessive). Their OOP usage is pretty shithouse, and there are lot of similarities to the way C applications are coded.</p>
<p>Personally I think only the client is made in Java, to make the game easily playable and accessible. I think the server would run smoother/faster using C, giving them far more control over memory allocation etc.</p>
<p>Edit: Ignore everything I said above, it’s all lies.</p>

<p>Creating a whole new scripting language for a game engine? How un-farfetched… ever heard of Unrealscript?<br>
While I am not saying the server isn’t written in Java, it’s perfectly reasonable to assume it is written in C++ also. They do hire C programmers, after all. And ask for C knowledge for their server administrators.</p>

<p>They don’t use Solaris servers, they run Debian. At least, they do for some things, so I don’t see why they wouldn’t for everything.</p>

<p>Want to know how to crash RS servers? First, gather around 1,000-2,000 zombie computers (yes, a botnet) and then have them flood the TCP port of one of RuneScape’s servers. Assuming that the bandwidth power of 1,000-2,000 zombie computers is equal to that of the cluster of servers that runs one RS world, you should be able to knock them out for a good  hour or so. Other types of denial of service attacks could be helpful, but you have to remember these servers running RS are at top-of-the-line datacenters, which most likely employ methods to protect against SYN floods, and other classic denial of service methods.</p>

We use loops and strings and eventually end up in something called ‘spaghetti’ when making our ‘servers’<br>
They don’t use loops, they use different languages as well, if they coded it in java only, it would end up a horrid mess and be hack regularly, just like rsc was before the massive update.<br>
Now I belive they run with 8 or 9 different programming languages to prevent such things because you would have to have a cracker resolve each of these languages at the same time, and nobody in this community has a computer ‘willing enough’ to do something like that.</p>

              <p>I was thinking, that is it possible to crash Runescapes server/servers with a server crasher (designed for private servers) IF you’d know their IP and port. So I used VisualRoute to find their IP it is 64.37.71.203 although the port is needed also. Don’t know that will this work, will their firewall block it or something else. Try for yourself. If some “mastermind” figures this out, who knows what would happen? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> ServerCrasher is attached ( The creator of the server crasher is rs2crasher ).</p>
