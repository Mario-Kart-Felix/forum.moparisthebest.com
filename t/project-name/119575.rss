    <description>So I got this email just now:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi,

  I&#39;m writing you because I have realized that something quite
  unfortunate has happened.

  Yesterday, while I was going through my mail, I saw that there was a
  guy who proposed Cherokee for the &#39;Community Choice Awards&#39;. It was
  a great surprise until a realized of the misunderstanding that was
  going on.

  I started a project named Cherokee a few years ago:

     http://www.cherokee-project.com/archive/

  It&#39;s a web server written from scratch, that is doing quite well
  these days.

  As you can imagine, it has been quite a big surprise to see that you
  chose the same name for one of your projects as well. In fact, when
  this guy that I mentioned before voted for SF.net&#39;s Cherokee, he
  thought he was voting for Cherokee-the-server:

     http://www.cherokee-project.com/archive/2007-June/002234.html

  So, I&#39;m writing you for kindly asking you to give up the SF.net
  project name. The current situation is quite confusing for our users
  (of both projects), so we ought to try to correct it ASAP.

  We would appreciate A LOT if you could change your project name.

  Thanks!!

I responded with:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hello,

I apologize for this little mix-up we have going here.  Before I finally decided on the name cherokee I went to google and searched &quot;cherokee&quot;, &quot;cherokee program&quot;, and &quot;cherokee software&quot; and since no results came up and the name was not taken on sourceforge, I was forced to conclude that no other program had the name.

One good thing about this mix-up is that the confusion should be minor at best, since my program is nothing at all like a webserver.  I hope you understand that I had no intention of stealing your name, again I apologize.  I am glad that the real cherokee is also licensed under the GNU/GPL, it is always a pleasure to talk to an open source software developer.

Since you obviously had the name first, not to mention the fact that your project is currently much better and more widely used than mine, I will of course change the name of my project.  However, before I put in the request at sourceforge to change my name (since you can only request a change once every six months) I will first clear the new name with you.  So as not to confuse the people that use my program I would like to change it as little as possible, so would something like &#39;CherokeeEngine&#39;, &#39;CherokeeFramework&#39;, or &#39;CherokeeBot&#39; be alright with you?

I will put in for the name change as soon as you get back to me, thanks for understanding, and I wish you good luck with your project in the future.

Sincerely,
moparisthebest (Travis)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Should we change the name entirely? (I don&#39;t really want to) Or go with one of my suggestions there in the email if the real cherokee devs agree?</description>

              <p>hmm, that is a prickly situation,<br>
well I’d prefer if it was something like CherokeeEngine, because some people around here know the name, and it would be nice if they didn’t get confused for a bit.</p>
<p>On the other hand, not many people know, so it wouldnt be that much of a loss if it was called the Blight or something like that XD ;p<br>
but please name it something, I dont really like all those private bots that dont have names, then you just refer to them by their writers name, “pplssuqbawls’s bot”, “ollie’s bot”, “semaphore’s bot”, cmon guys, how about some imagination once in a while <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>offtopic: i know you posted 4 days ago, but I’v been away for a week, and I’m catching a plane tomorrow, I’ll be back 2nd of september. And I dont think I’ll be very active in that time, perhaps loggin in every so often.</p>
