    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsc-server-iso-image/354510</link>
    <description>So Vrunk was talking about making an image of a VPS/virtual machine so that people can simply restore the image on their machines and have a fully working RSC server straight out of the box. No images were ever released though as I think he lost motiviation.

Anyway, the point... Would anyone find a download iso, restore in VMWare-insta RSC server useful?</description>

              <p>I’d really appreciate RSCA being easier to run, I mean I think I can handle creating new database entries in MySQL (using Phpmyadmin) but that’s about my limit and about how much effort I’d be bothered putting in to get the game to work <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>So yes, I’d appreciate it a lot if RSCA (and even RSCDv25 for old times sake :)) were somehow put together so I could run them relatively easy and effortless!</p>

<p>I am using virtualbox as the VM atm though, not sure if it’s possible to import a virtualbox machine into VMWare</p>

<p>Statistically? Where are you getting these statistics from?<br>
There is no way you could know such a high percentage of java from the RSCD source code. The source doesn’t cover everything java offers/or it’s full potential. There is so much more to java than what the RSCD source has. It’s <span class="bbcode-u">way off</span>, and you know it. Stop looking for a never-ending, redundant, typical Moparscape argument.</p>
<p>I’m done here.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not giving any statistics, I was simply stating the field I was specifically speaking about, I suggest you learn how to speak English.</p>
<p>He could have added any number of things…  Furthermore, no one can know, until they know all of the unknowns.  You can only guess with a high probability of being correct.</p>
<p>Just to finish this up quickly…  You cannot give a percentage of how much of any language you know.  For example, you don’t say, “I know 73.5% of English.”  You say, “I know English”, “I don’t know English”, or “I know some English”, etc.  The phrases that I used as an example are based on how well you can use the language to communicate.</p>
<p>This can, and is directly applied to any language, even programming languages.  But, instead of communication it would be how well one can make an application/applet; which includes multiple attributes, such as complexity, functionality, stability, etc.</p>
<p>P.S.  The “I’m done here” really means, “I know I’m losing this argument; I’m going to ‘go away’, after I make one last comment, so I can pretend I’ve had last word, making me the winner.”</p>

<p>Because the RSCD source doesn’t use every aspect of java. So when they say they know “60% of java” without ever trying something different than the RSCD code, it’s going to be a completely inaccurate percentage. Do you understand?</p>

</aside>
<p>Like I’ve been saying, their accuracy on that percentage they randomly thought of would be “<span class="bbcode-u">way</span> off” when it comes to java. It would be more accurate if they had said “I know 60% of the RSCD source code”.</p>
<p>What was the point of this, CodeForFame? Lol.</p>

</aside>
<p>No, you’re assuming, you can’t definitely say it’s “<span class="bbcode-u">way</span> off”, you can only assume with the information you have.</p>

<p>Considering they haven’t touched anything but the RSCD source code, and the fact that no one has came forward to correct me. yeah; I can definitely make that assumption.</p>

<p>Because the RSCD source doesn’t use every aspect of java. So when they say they know “60% of java” without ever trying something different than the RSCD code, it’s going to be a completely inaccurate percentage. Do you understand?<br>

<p>If you don’t know what Java contains, you can’t make an accurate judgement of how much they know, because it’s unknown.[/quote]</p>
<p>Like I’ve been saying, their accuracy on that percentage they randomly thought of would be “<span class="bbcode-u">way</span> off” when it comes to java. It would be more accurate if they had said “I know 60% of the RSCD source code”.</p>
<p>What was the point of this, CodeForFame? Lol.</p>
