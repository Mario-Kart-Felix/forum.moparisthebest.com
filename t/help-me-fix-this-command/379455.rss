    <title>Help me fix this command?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-fix-this-command/379455</link>
    <description>ok so i made a halfass command that i need help with

what i am trying to do is add a 1 h our timer (3.6m milisec) so that this command can only be used once per hour

im having trouble getting the timer to work correctly

when i compile i get no errors and the command pops up the window its supposed to but it does not give the gp/pkp/timer meaning you can still use it over and over and the item/pk points never get put on the char file

and if i remove the timer completely from the command the command works perfect giving the items/pk points and bringing up the vote window
however it does not have the timer i need implemented when i remove it ofc

anyways to get to the point can someone please help me fix this command to get it working correctly




[code=java]if (playerCommand.equals(&quot;vote&quot;)) {
            long commandDelay = 3600000; //1 hour
            // loop for stupid stuff
            if (System.currentTimeMillis() - commandDelay &lt; 3600000 ) {
               for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++)
                                        if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
                                                Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
                                                c2.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?action=up&amp;server=tainted-pkz.no-ip.org&quot;, 12000); //actions to do
                        commandDelay = System.currentTimeMillis();
                        c.sendMessage(&quot;You receive 10 pk points and 10m for voting you can do this once every hour.&quot;);
                                                c.pkPoints += 10;
                                                c.getItems().addItem(995, 10000000);
                                        }
                            }
