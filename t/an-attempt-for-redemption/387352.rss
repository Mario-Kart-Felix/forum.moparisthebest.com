    <description>[center][size=18pt][b]An Attempt for Redemption[/b][/size][/center]


Its been bothering me lately, the community I once knew back in 2009 is quickly diminishing (for those of you who will point this out, I forget my password on my old account when I moved houses.) I miss how MoparScape use to be the number one community, as soon as a new version of RuneScape was out we had a updated version of their cache stripped down and ready for users to use on their games in a matter of hours. Now all I see is the same server posted a million times with a different name and virus&#39;s running rampant threw download links. I want to be part of making Moparscape what it use to be, I know almost all of you miss this too (older members). Will anyone out there join me in a small battle to start to motivate the community to work again. We could have contests with prizes for the best server ideas, have more mods on staff to regulate posts and monitor download links and just have more fun with what were doing. Servers now are all for profit and almost always are run for a few weeks then shut down cause the person made enough money. I miss the good old days were servers were up for years, new quests came out weekly along with updates and everyone had fun. Please MoparScape, give us these times back.</description>

<p>I’ll support you, of course.</p>
<p>I think there is a major problem as to the declining activity on moparscape.</p>
<p>Look at R-S and RL.</p>
<p>They have so many boards, ranging from graphics, to runescape showcases, to scripting, etc.</p>
<p>If we had those boards, it would increase the activity, in my opinion</p>

              <p>I used to play a server called “RoonScape” (original ya?) which was on for a very long time. It had click training until you reach 70, thene you’d need to go PvP. Then there’s the manhole, which made it so you can get ecto token drops which can be exchanged for barrows. On a side note, he started off with a pimpscape source (at least I think so because of the dragon armour smithing) and went on to create something actually very good.</p>

              <p>I don’t know much about Java coding, but I wish I did, and I want to learn. I want to make this community diverse so PI’s and Delta’s aren’t the only selection. I want to learn, but I can’t. I try to read tutorials, but they use terms that only people who already know how to code would understand. Basically, I need help to put it in Noob Friendly terms.</p>

<p>Its been bothering me lately, the community I once knew back in 2009 is quickly diminishing (for those of you who will point this out, I forget my password on my old account when I moved houses.) I miss how MoparScape use to be the number one community, as soon as a new version of RuneScape was out we had a updated version of their cache stripped down and ready for users to use on their games in a matter of hours. Now all I see is the same server posted a million times with a different name and virus’s running rampant threw download links. I want to be part of making Moparscape what it use to be, I know almost all of you miss this too (older members). Will anyone out there join me in a small battle to start to motivate the community to work again. We could have contests with prizes for the best server ideas, have more mods on staff to regulate posts and monitor download links and just have more fun with what were doing. Servers now are all for profit and almost always are run for a few weeks then shut down cause the person made enough money. I miss the good old days were servers were up for years, new quests came out weekly along with updates and everyone had fun. Please MoparScape, give us these times back.[/quote]</p>
<p>“Now all I see is the same server posted a million times with a different name and virus’s running rampant threw download links.” - This has always been the case… Nothing has changed since the opening of private servers, people download a source to run and make money… Though this is what private servers have become more of…</p>
<p>“have more mods on staff to regulate posts and monitor download links” - Moderators shouldn’t have to baby sit us, we should be able to take action our self by either reporting a the topic, telling someone on IRC, or contacting a moderator over PM, we shouldn’t have to depend on them to do everything by their self.</p>
<p>“We could have contests with prizes for the best server ideas” - This would be neat…</p>
<p>“I miss the good old days were servers were up for years, new quests came out weekly along with updates and everyone had fun.” - I know very few servers that are up for years and had new quests, updates, etc, etc come out every week…</p>
