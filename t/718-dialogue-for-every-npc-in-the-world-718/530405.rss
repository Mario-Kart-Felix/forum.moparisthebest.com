    <title>[718] Dialogue For Every Npc In The World [718]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-dialogue-for-every-npc-in-the-world-718/530405</link>
    <description>Hey you guys,

I&#39;m working on a development team of about 6 people and am working with Arcik on a new 718/747 framework now.
**This snippet should still work with the Matrix framework, you just have to change a couple of lines of code.

I thought I&#39;d release this simple class for adding (randomized) dialogue to every single NPC in the world. 

This allows the NPC to talk with their proper chat head and name. So it&#39;s pretty neat. 

You can always add more dialogues.


[code=java]package org.aldagrim.game.player.dialogues;

import java.util.Random;

import org.aldagrim.Settings;

public class UniversalDialogue extends Dialogue {

	private static int npcId = -1;
	
	public UniversalDialogue() {
		
	}

	@Override
	public void start() {
		npcId = (Integer) parameters[0];
		Random r = new Random();
		int random = r.nextInt(25); // your case numbers should end at one less than this value
		switch(random) { //add more cases for a larger dialogue-base to choose from.
		case 0:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Dark and difficult times lie ahead, friend...&quot;);
			break;
		case 1:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Soon we will have to face the choice&quot;,
									      &quot;of what is right and what is easy.&quot;);
			break;
		case 2:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;These are dark times, there is no denying...&quot;);
			break;
		case 3:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;The worst is yet to come, young traveler.&quot;);
			break;
		case 4:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;It is our choices, adventurer, that show us&quot;,
										 &quot;what we truly are; far more than our abilities.&quot;);
			break;
		case 5: 
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Death and darkness shall wreak havoc&quot;,
										 &quot;on &quot; + Settings.SERVER_NAME + &quot; once more! Prepare yourself, traveler.&quot;);
			break;
		case 6:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;I&#39;m busy! Go explore the world of &quot; + Settings.SERVER_NAME + &quot;!&quot;);
			break;
		case 7:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Stop wasting time trying to talk to me! I have nothing useful to tell you, traveler.&quot;);
			break;
		case 8:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;What? C&#39;mon, spit it out? Ugh, I don&#39;t have time for this. Be gone!&quot;);
			break;
		case 9:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Go catch a salmon or something. I&#39;m preoccupied.&quot;);
			break;
		case 10:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Excuse me, but if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to be left to my thoughts. Thank you.&quot;);
			break;
		case 11:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Don&#39;t you have some exploring to do?&quot;);
			break;
		case 12:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Please excuse me, traveler, I&#39;m focusing on my thoughts.&quot;);
			break;
		case 13:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Welcome to the world of &quot; + Settings.SERVER_NAME + &quot;!&quot;);
			break;
		case 14:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Greetings, brave adventurer! I hope you enjoy your stay in our village.&quot;);
			break;
		case 15:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, &quot;
										+ &quot;	but just as much to stand up to your friends.&quot;);
			break;
		case 16:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;The things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end,&quot;
											+ &quot; if not always in the way we expect.&quot;);
			break;
		case 17:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;We have all got both light and dark inside us. &quot;
										+ &quot;What matters is the power we choose to act on. &quot;
										+ &quot;That&#39;s who we really are.&quot;);
			break;
		case 18:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Not to be rude or anything, but this isn&#39;t really a great time for me.&quot;);
			break;
		case 19:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;I love magic.&quot;);
			break;
		case 20:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more, believing in yourself.&quot;);
			break;
		case 21:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;To the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.&quot;);
			break;
		case 22:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Its the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.&quot;);
			break;
		case 23:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;Do not pity the dead, traveler. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love.&quot;);
			break;
		case 24:
			sendNPCDialogue(npcId, 9827, &quot;My vision seems to be failing me, are you a boy or a girl?&quot;);
			break;
		default: 
			end();
			break;
		}
	}

	@Override
	public void run(int interfaceId, int componentId) {
		end();
	}

	@Override
	public void finish() {
		
	}
