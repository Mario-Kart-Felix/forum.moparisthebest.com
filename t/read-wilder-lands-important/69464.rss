    <description>I believe everyone is tired of such bullshiting servers, whose you train in dummies, and hit doors for strenght, or even search needles for defence, I&#39;m talking about no-monster, and all around pvp servers( i mean who wants to pk at varrock east bank). I am here to make a proposal to each one of you. Wilder Lands is a server who&#39;s bringing back wilderness, level-zone wilderness, and counts also with perfect combat (ranged working like in rs, magic working like in rs), monsters and specific towns.

TOWNS

In this server, every town is going to be a skill town, meaning each town will have the npc selling supplies for the skill the town is purposed to ( they will be selling at high prices to motivate people to skill ). Meaning falador will no longer be deserted, there will be a npc selling ores near the furnace, and a npc selling pickaxes outside the mining guild. Each town will also have a general store and a standard armour seller (bronze to addy, in some towns bronze to some pieces of rune, to make it more realistic). Another example will be camelot, in which there will be a npc selling logs, bowstrings, fletching equipment and also wc axes. There will be a rare seller isolated from every town, who will be located in the mountain, near falador. There will be also monsters all around the map, for you to kill, and a wilderness.

WILDERNESS

I plan wildy to be level-zoned, meaning players will have the joy to make wildy pures once again, because their pures won&#39;t get pked by max level people , neither can pk low levels at the wilderness. The wildy will be just like rs. There will be also a duel arena fully working, where people can stake secure that they wont get pked, neither have their cash stolen because of duel arena bugs. Wildy and duel arena will rock.

EXP

The experience rate will be 5x the normal runescape experience, the only difference is that monsters will have 5x more life, meaning it will be easier to train, but harder to kill high-leveled monsters. This will give Wilder Lands more challenges, and will make training easier. For non-combat skills the exp will be around 6x, a little bit higher than combat exp multiplier.

Hosting

The server will be 24/7. I will host it in my pc, and I will cool the pc down at mondays 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Brazilian time zine. I have a 4mb internet, who supports around 150 players without lag, and I will count with a server restarter for when the server crash.

This is my idea for wilder lands. Any of you interested? Well enter this network at hamachi:
Wilder Lands W1 to W6, pass wild. 

OR PM ME!

All we need to start the server is a testscape client without monsters, without NPCs or commands. This is all, my nickname at hamachi : Own. See you there!</description>
