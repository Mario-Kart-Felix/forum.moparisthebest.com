          i&#39;m bored and i feel like running a server for a while.
anyways,
    i went on java&#39;s site and got confused,
 i ended up downloading some thing &quot;netbeans&quot; some java thing.. lol
      and whenever i try to comipe the server it says &quot;please install java&quot;
  and i thought i did O_o   i got netbeans from java...
       w/e   if someone can just tell me which one to install,
i&#39;d be pretty happy indeed :]
     oh yea, and about the variables...
