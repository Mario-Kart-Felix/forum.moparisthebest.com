              <p>not sure what your asking but … if you have your server ready to go and everything do these steps</p>
<ol>
<li>click Runserver</li>
<li>Open Mopar</li>
<li>(don’t click start server … that might what you have been doing) just click login the put the user name you wish</li>
<li>have fun on your server</li>
</ol>
<p>if that doesn’t work then try putting your server ip for new server on mopar?</p>
<p>sorry if this didn’t help</p>
