    <title>Looking for a server host</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-server-host/123975</link>
    <description>Due to my computer lags, and my father dose not want me to unblock the port needed, I&#39;m looking for a good 24/7 host that is not currently hosting a server, but has the ideas of how to host one, I need a dedicated person, and they need to know how to make an FTP setup, and the port could possibly be 43594. If you could, leave a message here, or contact me with:

AIM: PloxieScape@aim.com might not need @aim.com.
MSN: Boomk_xd@hotmail.com
I am currently on MSN, so let me know if you can host it for me.

<p>Well, I don’t want to use Hamachi anymore, I have before, it just isn’t my kind of server liking, no one really have gotten on, my Forums direct to my PhPBB Forum.</p>
