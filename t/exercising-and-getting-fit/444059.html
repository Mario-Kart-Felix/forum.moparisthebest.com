        <p>I’m just curious, but has anyone here made it a long-term goal to do so before (Note this isn’t a question, but I want to see some discussion)? I’ve been a lazy poor eater for a long time and I finally decided to do something about it (Not to mention my stomach doesn’t look too attractive right now). It’s been just over a week now with Sunday my only day off exercising and trying to eat right, and I haven’t seen results. Granted, the first week it was more to get into the routine of working out and today was the first day I was really challenged.</p>
<p>I’ve spent some time reading articles on the best eating and exercising patterns. I’ve decided to follow <a href="http://exercise.about.com/cs/exbeginners/l/blimplement.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This Guide</a> with the schedule of the beginner’s workout (except more cardio workouts) but intensity of the intermediate exercises. I currently weigh about 160 lbs and I’d like to be around 140 lbs or more depending on my muscle gain, since I’ll also be working out and not just doing cardio exercise. My goal is to make it happen by August.</p>
<p>So here’s what I’ve gathered in terms of proper eating: Start the day off with a proper breakfast, which includes pretty much what you’d expect - banana, cereal, toast, etc… Eat a small snack somewhere between lunch, which basically includes… snacks - nuts, some form of chips, fruit, etc… For lunch, well, it’s lunch. I haven’t read on recommendations, but it’s pretty obvious what to eat and what to avoid. I guess just look at the nutrition facts of what you’re about to eat. A good dinner is really anything rich in protein, unsaturated fats, fiber, etc… Again, pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t see how people have trouble with dieting. I used to drink multiple cans of pop (or soda for assholes) a day and almost never touch water, but I’ve only drank 2 cans in almost 2 weeks - and there’s my favorite kind readily available at this very moment. Now I drink about 3 water bottles a day and lay off the snacks and I don’t have any trouble. I guess it’s a matter of self control.</p>
<p>Now, the biggest issue I’ve had with exercising is I don’t know when to. I live in Arizona, and it’s summer time, meaning the temperature is usually over 100F from 12PM til dusk. I’m a teenager, so I sleep in late, but that doesn’t matter. I’ve performed all my exercises so far at 4-6PM every day - just after the hottest part. Again, I think it’s a self control and motivation thing. But that’s not at all what I wanted to address. Logically, when you burn calories, your body goes for what it just made, so if you exercise after you just ate, you’re going to feel hungry and not burn any of the fat you have stored - seems pretty wasteful to me. Apparently, it’s best to go exercising at least an hour since you last ate, depending on your metabolism, how much you ate, and what you ate. I think for these reasons, it’s best to go exercising after breakfast. It gets your metabolism going, it’s the only thing you’ve eaten so far, there’s enough time to drink at least a bottle of water and be fully hydrated, and there’s some other reasons that are less significant.</p>
<p>So here’s what I’ve learned and plan on following for the next 2 months in a nutshell:<br>
-Cardio exercise 5 times a week<br>
-Upper body, lower body, and core workouts each once a week. Stretch the other days<br>
-Exercise after breakfast<br>
-Snacks are good, but not in large amounts and more than twice a day. They keep your metabolism going<br>
-A meal with a big protein portion, along with some sort of green vegetable should be had after exercising to properly rebuild muscles<br>
-Get a proper amount of sleep<br>
-Avoid anything other than water, tea, milk, coffee, and anything that wasn’t naturally made sweet<br>
-Fats usually beat carbohydrates - you can read about it on page 2 of the Weight Loss Solutions article I linked below.<br>
-If you’re going for weight loss, weigh yourself in the morning and not throughout the day. Your body has burned up what you ate through the night, so in the morning is when you most likely weigh your true weight. I was 157 lbs early one day and 160 late the next.<br>
-Don’t skip out on exercising and get lazy. Don’t look at what people have, and don’t aim high. Set long-term goals, but bust your ass either way. You’re not going to see an immediate change.</p>

<p>Some people swear by a 6 a.m. jog to get their hearts racing and get them psyched up for the day. Others wouldn't dream of breaking a sweat before noon. But is any certain time of day the best time to exercise?</p>

<p>Now, I’m not at all an expert on any of this stuff, but I sort of wanted to summarize everything I learned not only so it was easier for me to comprehend, but so other people here could learn from it as well. I don’t believe in the fast-acting eat-as-much-as-you-want weight loss and muscle gains. You have to work for things like these, and there’s no such thing anyway. I also don’t believe you need a gym or anything like that to get fit. Look at videos like P90X - doing what the videos show, you can work every single muscle in your body with only using something like a stool or rag occasionally (I was in a fitness class all 3 of my highschool years and we had to do these workouts from time to time).</p>
<p>So uuuh… Yeah, there’s my late-at-night big article thing. Hope it was a good read and maybe inspired some of you looking to get in shape but don’t know where to start.</p>

        <p>I used to be pretty fat (270lbs, ~122.5kg) I’m down to 200lbs, (~90.7 kg) and it was all from my job haha, didn’t really set out to lose weight but manual labor does it to you… I still eat fast food far more than I should (hurr american stereotype fu) I’d say if I’d drop the fast food and drink a lot less soda I could probably drop a few more lbs, but I kinda feel fine at the weight I’m at now.</p>
<p>The biggest thing imo is to try not to look at it as a chore and more like something you just do… If you look at it like “ughh, this sucks I miss eating XXX” or “This sucks, I don’t want to exercise” you’ll eventually give up, like I did many many times before.  The main thing is just to keep at it, you’ll probably actually experience some weight gain (depending on if you’re doing weight lifting or just aerobics) because muscle weighs more than fat, but it’ll eventually start going down once you are burning off the calories.</p>
<p>Depending on the build you actually want (big beefy muscles or slender and tone) I’d go with:<br>
Beefy: Lift weights while you still have the fat on you, the fat will turn to muscle and it’ll be bulkier<br>
Slender: Do more aerobics and drop the weight, then start doing more lifting to increase muscle tone.</p>
<p>Just my random stream of thoughts that spur off in multiple directions.  Good luck, Lin.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, along with my “You’ll probably gain weight before losing it”, for most people that are actually trying to lose weight, it’s recommended that you actually don’t weigh yourself at all because you’ll (most-likely) get discouraged.  The key is to wait and you’ll start feeling a difference with how your clothes fit you.</p>

        <p>The biggest complaint I have is that I am having a very very difficult time getting rid of the rest of my man boobs rofl, they used to be pretty big (I’d say big enough for a training bra rofl).  They’ve actually decreased enough that I don’t care to around with my shirt off (mainly because a lot of people around here knew how big I used to be, so they’re like “oh you’ve lost a lot of weight”) but it’s still big enough that I don’t like it.</p>

        <p>A good way to avoid snacking is turn the lights up really bright. You won’t be as hungry for some reason.</p>
<p>I did try to lose weight 4 years ago. I started running 2 miles in the morning and I played basketball throughout the day. Dropped twenty pounds and was pretty healthy. Then football season ended and I let myself go. Now I’m about 265, I work out 3 days a week in the offseason and eat whatever I want. I’ve put on 50 pounds since last year. All muscle.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Evil_, post:2, topic:444059”]I used to be pretty fat (270lbs, ~122.5kg) I’m down to 200lbs, (~90.7 kg) and it was all from my job haha, didn’t really set out to lose weight but manual labor does it to you… I still eat fast food far more than I should (hurr american stereotype fu) I’d say if I’d drop the fast food and drink a lot less soda I could probably drop a few more lbs, but I kinda feel fine at the weight I’m at now.</p>
<p>The biggest thing imo is to try not to look at it as a chore and more like something you just do… If you look at it like “ughh, this sucks I miss eating XXX” or “This sucks, I don’t want to exercise” you’ll eventually give up, like I did many many times before.  The main thing is just to keep at it, you’ll probably actually experience some weight gain (depending on if you’re doing weight lifting or just aerobics) because muscle weighs more than fat, but it’ll eventually start going down once you are burning off the calories.</p>
<p>Depending on the build you actually want (big beefy muscles or slender and tone) I’d go with:<br>
Beefy: Lift weights while you still have the fat on you, the fat will turn to muscle and it’ll be bulkier<br>
Slender: Do more aerobics and drop the weight, then start doing more lifting to increase muscle tone.</p>
<p>Just my random stream of thoughts that spur off in multiple directions.  Good luck, Lin.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, along with my “You’ll probably gain weight before losing it”, for most people that are actually trying to lose weight, it’s recommended that you actually don’t weigh yourself at all because you’ll (most-likely) get discouraged.  The key is to wait and you’ll start feeling a difference with how your clothes fit you.[/quote]<br>
Your a cutie pie now.</p>

        <p>I suggest you do your runs at the hottest time in the day, it will for one make your body work harder to control its temperature and two you will sweat even more.</p>
<p>Right now I don’t need to really worry about what I eat, or how much I eat. Because I push carts around for 8 hours a day at times. I just need to figure out how I am going to work my left leg as much as my right leg… Right now I can see a pretty obvious difference in size over my right calf compared to my left…</p>

        <p>Last summer I went from 185 to 170 in about 2 months. I didn’t make any serious changes other than exercising (running and lifting) a good amount everyday and eating less. In order to eat less I would eat slower so I would realize I was full and I didn’t have to eat another helping of food. During the school year I kinda got out of the routine and I’m at 180 right now although I did get taller. I’m hoping to drop down to about 170 again this summer.</p>

<p>As long as you continue to drink water or another source of water that can also contain electro lights you should be fine to run for as long as your motivation lets you.</p>
