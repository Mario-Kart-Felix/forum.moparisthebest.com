    <title>I need to make Custom Items! some1 answer!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-to-make-custom-items-some1-answer/274973</link>
    <description>I know I&#39;ve already posted about it, but i got no where.

I need to know how to make custom items for my server.

People only sent me link to forums, which i had to look for myself, and found nothing

so if people know an EXACT forum post which says how to make custom armour/items/capes, etc, and NOT a forum board to make me look around, please if you could inform me that&#39;d be great

Thanks
