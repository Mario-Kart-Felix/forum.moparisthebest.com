    <title>[PI]Need help writing Server&gt;Client packet 218</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-help-writing-server-client-packet-218/553033</link>
    <description>I&#39;m really stumped on this packet because the method in the client that reads the data is only used by this one packet. No other packet, or even other method, uses it.
[url=https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/317-Open-chatbox-interface]Open chatbox interface[/url] - here is the rswiki page on the packet.

Because no other packet uses it, I ended up going into the Stream class of the client to read the method, which is this:
[code=java]
	public int method438() {
		currentOffset += 2;
		int j = ((buffer[currentOffset - 1] &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 8) + (buffer[currentOffset - 2] - 128 &amp; 0xff);
		if(j &gt; 32767)
			j -= 0x10000;
		return j;
	}[/code]

And then I went into the Stream class of the server to find the matching one:
[code=java]
	public int readSignedWordBigEndianA() {
		currentOffset += 2;
		int i = ((buffer[currentOffset - 1] &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 8)
				+ (buffer[currentOffset - 2] - 128 &amp; 0xff);
		if (i &gt; 32767)
			i -= 0x10000;
		return i;
	}[/code]

After that, I found the write method that had the closest name, and what looked like similar data but being sent out:
[code=java]
	public void writeWordBigEndianA(int i) {
		ensureCapacity(2);
		buffer[currentOffset++] = (byte) (i + 128);
		buffer[currentOffset++] = (byte) (i &gt;&gt; 8);
	}[/code]

Which gave me close to the correct results, but not.

I eventually resorted to just trying basically any Stream method that sent data using an int:
[code]writeByteA
writeByteS
writeByteC
writeWordBigEndianA
writeWordA
writeWordBigEndian_dup
writeDWord_v1
writeDWord_v2
writeByte
writeWord
writeWordBigEndian
write3Byte
writeDWord
writeDWordBigEndian
[/code]
All of which did not work (most crashed the client; which was expected.).
2 of them were close, the first one I mentioned and writeWordBigEndian_dup.

I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that I do not have a method that will write the data that it&#39;s asking for. But I&#39;m not familiar enough with I/O to know what the method would be.
My other solution was to edit the client and change what method is reading the int to one that I know, but I wanted to do it &quot;properly&quot;.


What would be the method I need to use for the packet?

Edit:
Here is my Stream class for the [b]Server[/b]: http://pastebin.com/X8nLryyN

And please do not confuse this with the [b]Client[/b] to server packet Report Abuse, this is the one from the server to the client.

One more thing:
The difference between this and packet 164 is this one is walkable.</description>

              <p>[quote=“matzie, post:10, topic:553033”][code]				case 218:<br>
int i8 = inStream.method438();<br>
dialogID = i8;<br>
inputTaken = true;<br>
pktType = -1;<br>
return true;</p>
<p>[/code][/quote]</p>
<p>There seems to be something wrong with setting just dialogID.</p>
<p><code>
						if(inputString.equalsIgnoreCase("::test")) {
							dialogID = 12122;
						}</code><br>
If I set it like this, it does the weird ‘glitch’ similar to what I had been getting when sending the packet.<br>
However, if I use this:</p>
<p><code>						if(inputString.equalsIgnoreCase("::test")) {
							backDialogID = 12122;
						}</code><br>
then it works like it should. I got the variable backDialogueID from packet 164.</p>
<p>Now I’ll have to try editing the packet receive code to use backDialogID instead of dialogID. Then re-test the packet server &gt; client.<br>
I’ll report my findings.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Changing the packet receive code to use backDialogID made it act basically like packet 164 (not walkable chat interface). I think it is due to inputTaken being set to true.</p>
<p>Edit 2:<br>
I got it working ‘more correct’ by adding in another check into the code that was causing the display state to be off. Now I’m having an issue with the interface not activating correctly. The “Click here to continue” text on a level up interface does not highlight when hovered nor does it work when clicked. I’m going to have to look into how backDialogID works more</p>
<p>Edit 3:<br>
I <em>think</em> everything is working now… The text lights up on hover, and works on clicking (But since the server isn’t telling the client to do anything after clicking, the interface stays on screen).</p>
<p>Here is the method I use in the <span class="bbcode-b">Server</span> to send the packet (Eat my naming):</p>
<p><code>
	public void sendWalkableChatOverlay(int interfaceId) {
		if (player == null || player.getOutStream() == null) {
			return;
		}
		synchronized (player) {
			player.getOutStream().createFrame(218);
			player.getOutStream().writeWordBigEndianA(interfaceId);
			player.flushOutStream();
		}
	}</code></p>
<p>And to get it to work “properly” in the client:</p>
<p>Making the interface display when the packet is received instead of the input interface:<br>
Find:</p>
<p><code> else if (dialogID &lt; 0) {
			newBoldFont.drawCenteredString(aString844, 259, 60, 0, -1);
			newBoldFont.drawCenteredString("Click to continue", 259, 80, 128, -1);
		}</code><br>
Replace:</p>
<p><code> else if (aString844 != null &amp;&amp; dialogID &lt; 0) {
			newBoldFont.drawCenteredString(aString844, 259, 60, 0, -1);
			newBoldFont.drawCenteredString("Click to continue", 259, 80, 128, -1);
		}</code><br>
Fixing the interface hovering and display state<br>
Find:</p>
<p><code>
		anInt886 = 0;
		anInt1315 = 0;
		if (super.mouseX &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; super.mouseY &gt; 338 &amp;&amp; super.mouseX &lt; 490 &amp;&amp; super.mouseY &lt; 463) {
			if (backDialogID != -1) {
				buildInterfaceMenu(20, RSInterface.interfaceCache[backDialogID], super.mouseX, 358, super.mouseY, 0);
			} else if (super.mouseY &lt; 463 &amp;&amp; super.mouseX &lt; 490) {
				buildChatAreaMenu(super.mouseY - 338);
			}
		}
		if (backDialogID != -1 &amp;&amp; anInt886 != anInt1039) {
			inputTaken = true;
			anInt1039 = anInt886;
		}
		if (backDialogID != -1 &amp;&amp; anInt1315 != anInt1500) {
			inputTaken = true;
			anInt1500 = anInt1315;
		}</code></p>
<p>Replace:</p>
<p><code>
		anInt886 = 0;
		anInt1315 = 0;
		if (super.mouseX &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; super.mouseY &gt; 338 &amp;&amp; super.mouseX &lt; 490 &amp;&amp; super.mouseY &lt; 463) {
			if (backDialogID != -1 || dialogID != -1) {
				buildInterfaceMenu(20, RSInterface.interfaceCache[backDialogID != -1 ? backDialogID : dialogID], super.mouseX, 358, super.mouseY, 0);
			} else if (super.mouseY &lt; 463 &amp;&amp; super.mouseX &lt; 490) {
				buildChatAreaMenu(super.mouseY - 338);

		}

			inputTaken = true;
			anInt1500 = anInt1315;
		}</code></p>
<p>Fixing interface scrolling when the walkable interface is shown:<br>
Find:</p>
<p><code>
		if (backDialogID == -1) {
			aClass9_1059.scrollPosition = anInt1211 - anInt1089 - 110;
			if (super.mouseX &gt; 478 &amp;&amp; super.mouseX &lt; 580 &amp;&amp; super.mouseY &gt; 342)
				method65(494, 110, super.mouseX - 0, super.mouseY - 348, aClass9_1059, 0, false, anInt1211);
			int i = anInt1211 - 110 - aClass9_1059.scrollPosition;
			if (i &lt; 0)
				i = 0;
			if (i &gt; anInt1211 - 110)
				i = anInt1211 - 110;
			if (anInt1089 != i) {
				anInt1089 = i;
				inputTaken = true;
			}
		}</code></p>
<p>Replace:</p>
<p><code>
		if (backDialogID == -1 &amp;&amp; dialogID == -1) {
			aClass9_1059.scrollPosition = anInt1211 - anInt1089 - 110;
			if (super.mouseX &gt; 478 &amp;&amp; super.mouseX &lt; 580 &amp;&amp; super.mouseY &gt; 342)
				method65(494, 110, super.mouseX - 0, super.mouseY - 348, aClass9_1059, 0, false, anInt1211);
			int i = anInt1211 - 110 - aClass9_1059.scrollPosition;
			if (i &lt; 0)
				i = 0;
			if (i &gt; anInt1211 - 110)
				i = anInt1211 - 110;
			if (anInt1089 != i) {
				anInt1089 = i;
				inputTaken = true;
			}
		}</code></p>
<p>Note:<br>
You probably still have to find a way to reset the interface on logout and when certain packets are sent from server &gt; client (Or even when some client actions are performed).<br>
The above is just making it work “properly”.</p>

<p>I know it’s not wrong… But it’s not “right”.<br>
I put right in quotations because while it works right and will be just fine, it is not right in terms of the original 317 packets.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, did you get the construct map region packet working? I think I have it <span class="bbcode-i">sending</span> correctly, but I don’t know what data is supposed to be sent.<br>
If you had an example of a Palette to send (Using Galkon’s Palette class) that would be amazing. I don’t know if I’m supposed to be setting x y z values in the Palette and then sending that, or what, really.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah but the thing is, I have nothing that sends a little, hence why I’m coming here for help.</p>
<p>I don’t exactly know how to “reverse engineer” this one.</p>
<p>The only thing I could think of to make it work would be a method that would look something like this:</p>
<p><code>        public void writeWordLittleEndianA(int i) {
                ensureCapacity(2);
                buffer[currentOffset++] = (byte) (i + 128);
                buffer[currentOffset++] = (byte) (i &gt;&gt; 8 &amp;&amp; 0xff);
        }</code><br>
And I’m almost guaranteed that won’t work.</p>
<p>Other than that, my only viable solution would be to change the packet to not use the read method and to use another (like change it so it’s reading a big endian, and then send a big endian). It’s something I don’t want to do simply because I want things done “right” but if I must, I must.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’m really stumped on this packet because the method in the client that reads the data is only used by this one packet. No other packet, or even other method, uses it.<br>
<a href="https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/317-Open-chatbox-interface" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Open chatbox interface</a> - here is the rswiki page on the packet.</p>
<p>Because no other packet uses it, I ended up going into the Stream class of the client to read the method, which is this:</p>
<p><code>
	public int method438() {
		currentOffset += 2;
		int j = ((buffer[currentOffset - 1] &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 8) + (buffer[currentOffset - 2] - 128 &amp; 0xff);
		if(j &gt; 32767)
			j -= 0x10000;
		return j;
	}</code></p>
<p>And then I went into the Stream class of the server to find the matching one:</p>
<p><code>
	public int readSignedWordBigEndianA() {
		currentOffset += 2;
		int i = ((buffer[currentOffset - 1] &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 8)
				+ (buffer[currentOffset - 2] - 128 &amp; 0xff);
		if (i &gt; 32767)
			i -= 0x10000;
		return i;
	}</code></p>
<p>After that, I found the write method that had the closest name, and what looked like similar data but being sent out:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public void writeWordBigEndianA(int i) {
		ensureCapacity(2);
		buffer[currentOffset++] = (byte) (i + 128);
		buffer[currentOffset++] = (byte) (i &gt;&gt; 8);
	}[/code]

Which gave me close to the correct results, but not.

I eventually resorted to just trying basically any Stream method that sent data using an int:
[code]writeByteA
writeByteS
writeByteC
writeWordBigEndianA
writeWordA
writeWordBigEndian_dup
writeDWord_v1
writeDWord_v2
writeByte
writeWord
writeWordBigEndian
write3Byte
writeDWord
writeDWordBigEndian</code></pre>
<p>All of which did not work (most crashed the client; which was expected.).<br>
2 of them were close, the first one I mentioned and writeWordBigEndian_dup.</p>
<p>I’ve come to the conclusion that I do not have a method that will write the data that it’s asking for. But I’m not familiar enough with I/O to know what the method would be.<br>
My other solution was to edit the client and change what method is reading the int to one that I know, but I wanted to do it “properly”.</p>
<p>What would be the method I need to use for the packet?</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Here is my Stream class for the <span class="bbcode-b">Server</span>: <a href="http://pastebin.com/X8nLryyN" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pastebin.com/X8nLryyN</a></p>
<p>And please do not confuse this with the <span class="bbcode-b">Client</span> to server packet Report Abuse, this is the one from the server to the client.</p>
<p>One more thing:<br>
The difference between this and packet 164 is this one is walkable.</p>
