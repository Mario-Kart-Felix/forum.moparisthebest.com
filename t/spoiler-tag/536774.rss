<p>It is great that there is a resolved section, however it seems like a lot of in-progress or in-discussion threads are stuck between plenty of denied suggestions. It would be nice if we could get a status update or decision on some of them on the actual thread so that they are bumped to the top of the section and stay relevant.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is why I asked someone to bump those threads that are being dealt with, this way people don’t create multiple threads.</p>
<p>OT: I seriously think an official thread about the current state of the forums is severely needed, as well as what the plans are after the upgrade has been completed. I mean honestly it feels like no one cares about the upkeep of the forums anymore, and we just see a lot of “oh it will be done eventually.” But that is just my opinion and what I feel I am seeing, which may not necessarily be the case.</p>

              <p>I’ve looked at the installation XML for the SMF modifications that are currently available and I don’t see where the issues would come from. The forum is customised but not to a point where it’s an entirely different forum software. For further clarity I’ve asked moparisthebest to go through the manual installation instructions for a spoiler modification (<a href="http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/?mod=195">http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/?mod=195</a>) and he’s said it seems straightforward and shouldn’t be an issue to install out of the box, when we upgrade.</p>

              <p>Why would you write a spoiler plugin though, there are already like 6 that work? No suggestion has been denied because of anything along the lines of the above, that I can confirm after just going through the resolved suggestions and we don’t intentionally ignore anything. If you want to write a plugin to join the other handful then go ahead. There is little point on debating the security of who has access because at the end of the day moparisthebest is unlikely to change it, and even if he did I don’t want it, the current setup is fine and we have methods of communication that get moparisthebest here in exceptionally quick time.</p>
<p>As far as the forum upgrade goes and the developer that is something you would need to talk with moparisthebest about.</p>

              <p>Am I right in presuming that the forum database is also stored on that VM? If so, there would be extra security to gain in that if MITB’s account was compromised (or the forum itself was attacked whilst he was away) then the other administrator with access could make the necessary changes to stop the attack. Having only one member who is able to have access presents issues if that one member is compromised or away.</p>
<p>Also why is that developer not allowing anyone else to help with the forum upgrade? Why is he being kept secret? You’re wrong, by the way, if I was to write a plugin for the current version, it would be suitable for addition to the current version, it would just require an update when the forum is updated. If you have a “don’t improve anything because it will need changing” attitude then I can see why so many suggestions are denied or ignored.</p>

              <p>All the administrators have the same rank, so moparisthebest has the same level of permissions on his account that I have on mine. The difference comes in SSH access to the VM that contains the forum files. Administrators have access to everything a default SMF administrator would except uploading/editing files is disabled by setting them to read only on the server. There is nothing to gain by giving anybody but moparisthebest access to the forum files other than an increased security risk, we’re waiting on a forum upgrade that another developer is making regardless of who has access to what this means even if you wrote the plugin we wouldn’t be able to add it due to waiting on an update (this has been explained like a million times all over the forum as well).</p>

From what I’ve heard when Mopman was still admin his account was hacked and they changed the forum theme code so even that was removed. Administrators merely control the staff and the current boards.

              <p>Nope. Though the only reason it hasn’t been implemented is because of the situation with the forum upgrade. If something is in discussion and hasn’t been updated with a conclusion it’s safe to assume there are technical issues that are restraining the ability to implement it that we can’t put a fix date on.</p>
