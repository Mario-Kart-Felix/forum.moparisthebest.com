So I decided to get a little innovative today and in school I had an Idea... &quot;I want to make a homemade hookah&quot; Lol, basically out of bordom I thought this would be a little fun project to challenge me and see how creative I can get. Some of you may of remembered my guide on the Homemade waterpipe, That guide was a fail because it was filled with dangerous parts that could harm you if ingested (I.E: Tin foil.) This hookah is safe and is actually to my supriise very nice!

Onto the guide!

[b][u]Materials you&#39;ll need[/u][/b]
- [b]Chamber[/b] (This can be anything a plastic bottle, Jar, In my case I used an old easter egg case)
- [b]A hose(s)[/b] (I used some hose I picked up at walmart for bike pumps but you can use anything like garden hose)
- [b]Hot glue gun[/b] (Gorilla glue also works fine since its heat proof but I don&#39;t recommend Super glue) [You can substitue glue out for tape if you want but only electrical or Duct tape
- [b]Stem[/b] (In my case I used a gutted tire pressure gauge but an emptied mechanical pencil/pen works fine also)
- [b]Bowl[/b] (I used a socket that was 7/16 but anything that fits your stem will work doesn&#39;t have to be exact)
- [b]Water[/b] (duh...)
- [b]Screen[/b] (This can be pretty much anything from stopping ashes from entering You can use I used a screen from under a sink faucet you can use steel wool. AVOID TIN FOIL AT ALL COST ONLY USE AS A LAST RESORT


-----------------------------------------------------------
[b]STEP 1: HOLES[/b]

- Depending on what type of chamber, and how many hoses you are using the holes can differ, But you MUST have 2. 1: For the bowl and stem and the other for the hose attachment

- Measure or estimate the width of the Stem and hose and cut out your whole accordingly I used a knife and smoothed out the edges with a razor blade you want to try and get this as accurate as possible so its less glue you must use to seal it. 

- Seal ANY holes that you wont be using, In mine I had 2 tiny holes at the bottom that I sealed with hot glue.
------------------------------------------------------------

[b]STEP 2: ASSEMBLY[/b]

- Take the stem you have and attach it to the bowl (Probably a socket)

- Make sure they fit if they don&#39;t exactly fit thats fine just make it as best as possible 

- Seal the bowl and stem with the hot glue at the base of the socket where they both connect 

- Take your screen and shove it into the bowl or if you&#39;re using steel wool shove it into the stem.

- Place the bowl and stem in the assigned hole and seal around it with glue or tape (Gum will work also but as a last resort) so that the only air that can get threw is via the bowl threw the stem

- Once you seal the bowl and stem take your hose and insert it into the other hole(s) (no pun intended ;)) be careful that you dont melt the hose with the hot glue gun so keep the metal tip away from it gum would actually be safer if you are afraid of it burning a hole threw.

- now add water to it and you are done! Easy as that! 

- MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS SEALED for the best results. 


Enjoy!!!!

<p>Lol, If I want to smoke Tobacco out of a Hookah I go to a Hookah bar, for everything else its Marijuana.

<p>Um, yeah they are. Cops make you take the hookah apart to check for that, genius. Also, if you’ve ever even smoked marijuana, getting resin out of a hookah would mean boiling all the pieces of your hookah. Anf if you have a half decent one, it will be too big to boil.<br>

Since when is boiling water the only method possible for cleaning out marijuana resin?[/quote]This.  They sell commercial cleaning solutions for bongs and pipes, one would assume they’d work in a hookah as well.</p>

<p>Also from doing research it turns out burning plastic can produce hydrogen cyanide which if you read on wikipedia states</p>
<p>A hydrogen cyanide concentration of 300 mg/m3 in air will kill a human within about 10 minutes. It is estimated that hydrogen cyanide at a concentration of 3500 ppm (about 3200 mg/m3) will kill a human in about 1 minute.</p>

<p>There is a difference between going out and buying one to making one. For me I can go out and buy one like I have with Pipes and bongs, that doesn’t stop me from making them…why? Because its fun, interesting to see how far you can go with it. Plus its a great way to stay in shape. Also not everyone will use coals on this, even if they do its still not a wise idea to use tin foil. Why take the risk when you can have something that looks a lot better than wrapping your bowl in tin foil.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why? Tin Foil can be very harmful  to your health while all you do with steel wool is jam it into the stem where its not seen or burned. You put it about 1-2 inches away from the bowl so it doesn’t get too hot. You can also get a screen from your sinks which is what I did in this particular video. It’s not like I’m going to stop you from using steel wool its not like it would hurt me any, just personally I wouldn’t recommend it.</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="6MfRSdwGWU0" data-youtube-title="" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>
<p>So I decided to get a little innovative today and in school I had an Idea… “I want to make a homemade hookah” Lol, basically out of bordom I thought this would be a little fun project to challenge me and see how creative I can get. Some of you may of remembered my guide on the Homemade waterpipe, That guide was a fail because it was filled with dangerous parts that could harm you if ingested (I.E: Tin foil.) This hookah is safe and is actually to my supriise very nice!</p>
<p>Onto the guide!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Materials you’ll need</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Chamber</span> (This can be anything a plastic bottle, Jar, In my case I used an old easter egg case)</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">A hose(s)</span> (I used some hose I picked up at walmart for bike pumps but you can use anything like garden hose)</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Hot glue gun</span> (Gorilla glue also works fine since its heat proof but I don’t recommend Super glue) [You can substitue glue out for tape if you want but only electrical or Duct tape</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Stem</span> (In my case I used a gutted tire pressure gauge but an emptied mechanical pencil/pen works fine also)</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Bowl</span> (I used a socket that was 7/16 but anything that fits your stem will work doesn’t have to be exact)</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Water</span> (duh…)</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Screen</span> (This can be pretty much anything from stopping ashes from entering You can use I used a screen from under a sink faucet you can use steel wool. AVOID TIN FOIL AT ALL COST ONLY USE AS A LAST RESORT</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">STEP 1: HOLES</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Depending on what type of chamber, and how many hoses you are using the holes can differ, But you MUST have 2. 1: For the bowl and stem and the other for the hose attachment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure or estimate the width of the Stem and hose and cut out your whole accordingly I used a knife and smoothed out the edges with a razor blade you want to try and get this as accurate as possible so its less glue you must use to seal it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seal ANY holes that you wont be using, In mine I had 2 tiny holes at the bottom that I sealed with hot glue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">STEP 2: ASSEMBLY</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take the stem you have and attach it to the bowl (Probably a socket)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure they fit if they don’t exactly fit thats fine just make it as best as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seal the bowl and stem with the hot glue at the base of the socket where they both connect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take your screen and shove it into the bowl or if you’re using steel wool shove it into the stem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the bowl and stem in the assigned hole and seal around it with glue or tape (Gum will work also but as a last resort) so that the only air that can get threw is via the bowl threw the stem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you seal the bowl and stem take your hose and insert it into the other hole(s) (no pun intended ;)) be careful that you dont melt the hose with the hot glue gun so keep the metal tip away from it gum would actually be safer if you are afraid of it burning a hole threw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>now add water to it and you are done! Easy as that!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS SEALED for the best results.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!!!</p>
<hr>
<p>Hits smoother than a cucumber (lolwut?). Its fucking boss.</p>
