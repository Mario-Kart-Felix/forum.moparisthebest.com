              <p>[quote=“malimt, post:3, topic:550948”]choose your directory as C:/ or Users.home<br>
I prefer users…[/quote]</p>
<p>Using C:/ nowadays is not great due to an increasing number of Mac users as the years have gone by. Macs don’t have the C:/ directory.</p>
<p>This is why we all should be using “<span class="bbcode-b">user.home</span>” This is used to make your client load a cache from a universal directory, meaning one that will work on <span class="bbcode-b">any</span> operating system.</p>
<p>The OP may have figured this out already, but just incase he hasn’t, In signlink, replace your findcachedir method with this:</p>
<p><code>	public static String findcachedir()
    {
        return System.getProperty("user.home")+"/YOUR CACHE NAME/";
    }</code></p>

              <p>Signlink.java and cachedownloader.java.<br>
Zip and upload your cache files, upload them to dropbox, get the short link for the uploaded cache…<br>
Then, make sure you have the right cache name in signlink and the right directory…<br>
Then, you could either choose your directory as C:/ or Users.home<br>
I prefer users…<br>
Need anymore help, comment.</p>

              <p>The reason why your client won’t run is because your client is trying to find the cache in the directory of where your client is located, you will need to change that in your signlink class to your desired location.<br>
Regarding the .Jar, can you be a little more specific as to what the issue is?</p>
