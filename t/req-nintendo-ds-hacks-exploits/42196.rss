    <title>Req) nintendo ds hacks/exploits</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-nintendo-ds-hacks-exploits/42196</link>
    <description>Recently i payed a mear £50.00 for a second hand nintendo ds lite. I bought this to experiment various hacks/exploits etc. So, i was wondering if anyone allready knows any?
The ds came with one game called &quot;Animal crossin&quot; it&#39;s pretty strange but it&#39;s quite amusing. I would like to know how to connect to the wi-fi. BUT i don&#39;t have a wireless router or a usb connecter to connect to the wi-fi. Is there any other way?
And i would like to know other exploits and hacks if you guys know any.</description>

              <p>i don’t know much about nintendo ds but i know lots about comp, internet, an routers. the ds’s wifi can connect with other ds’s within 75ft. u can play games with each other, against each other, and chat with the pen(writing actual messages) i have no idea if it can get on the internet… but i know psp can. if u don’t own a wireless router/network then u can go someplace that does. Most Starbucks, Sweet Bay Coffee Co., Panera Breads, Airports have wireless networks u can get on. or u could go to an internet cafe’. Also Most hotels have wireless and some libraries in big cities. If its anything like the psp internet setup. u go to network settings then let is scan for nearby wifi networks. then u may have to put in a WEP Or WPA key to access it. Or u can also go to a rich or nice neighborhood and get on stupid rich peoples unprotected wireless internet. i was getting cable interner for free from a neighbor on this comp that way! =P anyways… its not that hard to do. umight google about the ds that almost always helps</p>
