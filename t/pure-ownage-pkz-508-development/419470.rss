    <description>Alright, im starting a new server, Names Pure-Ownage_Pkz, The base im using is the second realse of Z508 From-Z508Z great base thank you, Anyways ill let you in on what im doing, [size=14pt][b]sorry dont have any pictures at the moment dont have time but will sure have them in the next few days![/b][/size]

Features:

-Added Multi Pking (Faladoor Middle)
-Added Coustom Pvp Ranks Starting At 100 ending at 7500 I belives, The only way you get rare items (Phats/Santas/H&#39;weens) 
-Changed Starting Area (Varrock Middle) Also has 2 Guys right beside eachother saying Welcome to Pure-Ownage_Pkz
-Added Vesta/Morrgians/Donater amulet/Donater Cape All this for donaters
-Added Donater Zone
-Changed Bonus&#39;s for a few weapons (They Were over powered)
-Changed spawning no need for money to spawn anymore
-Added a few commands like ::master &amp; ::pure

Thats all that i have added/Fixed so far still have a few plans on what i should do with the source, just dont no how at the moment but im learning still only my second server for 508, even though going from 317 to 508 aint much of a diffrence, but hopefully this goes better then my first 508!
