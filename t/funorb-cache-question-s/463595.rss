    <title>Funorb Cache Question(s)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/funorb-cache-question-s/463595</link>
    <description>Soo, I&#39;m looking at extracting a funorb cache, specifically the Steel Sentinels cache for the time being. Now Mykrominre posted this question a few months back in this same subforum, sinsoul replied, but since then sinsoul has omitted a lot the info that might&#39;ve stopped me asking a question like this back in june time.

What I&#39;ve done so far: Downloaded the &quot;extractor&quot; found in the posts of [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,534508.0.html][u]Here[/u][/url], attempted to run the SS cache through it and ended up failing. (I ran it via eclipse because the folder that the program looks for the cache was set to an RS one, so I just loaded the source, changed the directory it was looking for and ran the program)

So far, I am a complete noob when it comes to Java itself, but I can understand the majority of the code quite easily. (All I&#39;ve written is one tiny little mod for Minecraft in my time, which isn&#39;t *that* useful I&#39;d say)

Sooo, yeah. Maybe a little bit of a point in the right direction please? And I don&#39;t expect to be spoonfed it, but if someone does I won&#39;t be complaining. :P</description>

              <p>Yeah, something of a private server would be nice. I’m pretty much your average noob when it comes to RSPS’s to be honest. (All I’ve had to do with them before is forum moderating on that worldscape dump of a site).</p>
<p>And apologies for the uber long delay in a reply, I sorta forgot about this place for a few weeks cause of how little activity was on it. :S</p>
<p>ADDITION: (Because double posting makes forum nazis angry by the looks of it)<br>
Well after messing around, forgetting about this place, and then remembering it again. I’ve only completed half of what I wanted.</p>
<p>I’ve used a ‘client extractor’ that I found buried on these forums, and it works brilliantly in the sense that it extracts the client’s code, but not the rest of it. Considering that the Steel Sentinels (Lol funorb, I know) cache is 4.87mb uncompressed, and the result from the extractor is only 1.2mb disappoints and slightly confuses me.</p>
<p>So, any help for a newb like me?</p>
