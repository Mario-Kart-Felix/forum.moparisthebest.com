    <title>Itzscape V5 (AKA Lucifer&#39;s Hell Contd)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/itzscape-v5-aka-lucifers-hell-contd/292525</link>
    <description>Hello, I am going to get back into private servers. I&#39;m going to start where I left off at Itzscape V5. This server will be fully SQL integrated. It will be ran off of a dedicated server. If you wish to leave a suggestion please do and I will see about adding it into the server. Please do not apply for a position if you are not fully qualified

Objectives

*Clean out everything that&#39;s not used
*Organize everything
*Make server more efficient at handling large amounts of people.
*If we make a client make our own cache for use with it instead of hard coding the models into it.
*Make this server fully SQL
*Have online logs and information
*Stop Admins and staff from trading, Dueling, Banking, Killing, etc. (To make gameplay fair)





Positions Available

Client Programmers[code]

*Lusfr_
*xx qwertyuiop xx
*`Lewk_
*
*
*
*[/code]

Server Programmers[code]

*Lusfr_
*Pie&#39;
*xx qwertyuiop xx
*`Lewk_
*
*
*[/code]

If you are accepted I will post so on this thread along with your application and it will be the same if you are denied.

9. What do you think is the least important thing to remember in carrying out your duty?

<p>What do you think is the least important thing to remember in carrying out your duty?<br>
Myself. I’ll always take the time to help someone with any problems they may be experiencing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have any experience with Java (If so list)?<br>
I’ve been hosting and coding servers for about 2 years now. I had my own server for about a year<br>
and I’ve been hosting and coding servers for other people as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which do you think is more important: answering questions or moderating the World chat? Why?<br>
I think that moderating the world chat is more important, as other members will probably be able to<br>
answer most questions that anyone may have. If, however, someone is unable to find an answer to a<br>
question I will try to answer it for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there any other information that you would like to add that you feel will further your application?<br>
I haven’t really touched any Runescape clients in a while, so it would probably be better to give me<br>
a position in the Server Development team.<br>

Approved</p>
