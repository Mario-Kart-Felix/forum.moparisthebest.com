    <description>I am currently using deathlypvpzv5 source/client as a base but i have reworked alot of stuff and changed alot of things in it to make it diffrent from everthing else everyone has been doing.

so far i have 2 worlds going at the same time and these are the things im looking into doing but not sure how to achieve them yet.

things to do:

1.upgrade the server from 317 to 718+ without having to redo all the work that i already did. mabey something that auto upgrades a server/client something that injects the already made files into a newer rev blank source/server

2. connect the chats to both worlds so people can yell and itll show up on both and to beable to pm people between worlds.

3. if the first one is impossible to do then the rest of these could be done then

4. a working ge system/player own shops with a right click menu over a person and have it say shop and see what there selling like a regular shop does

5. auto client/cache updater so that people dont have to download the new version of the client when ever i update it.

6. a server restarter that lets people know theres a update and have it auto config and restart it self without me having to close the server and clicking config and running it again.

for incase ppl want to look at it heres it is.
