<p>Lol, no cheating is fair. Get it into perspective, either its all unfair or its all fair. For example, if you are part of this community, you are keeping it alive, and from this community hundreds of people are using scripts and cheating.Thats not fair either, is it?</p>

<p>Most of the level 3s you so arent sweat shoppers, they are infact autoers, but there are a fair amount of sweat shoppers who cut yews (mainly around rimmington)<br>
We have known that there are swear shoppers for a long time, i personally found out about a year ago while a certain mopar party was being held.</p>
<p>So its nothing new really, jagex are just trying to scare people.</p>
