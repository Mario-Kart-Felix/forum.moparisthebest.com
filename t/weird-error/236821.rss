    <title>Weird error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weird-error/236821</link>
    <description>So, it started out small and i though no biggie. on very few accounts, it would say &quot;account already logged in, please wait 60 seconds.&quot; And if it did that, you could never get on the acc again. but it was small. just 2-3 days ago, it started doing it to EVERY SINGLE ACCOUNT. now, no one can get on. at the same time the error occured to every account, I was working on custom weapons. i made a weapon (axe) in a 3d program called blender. then i scripted it, and made it a .obj file so the game would accept it, and added it to the models in my client. then i had to proporly add it in the server. these are the files i edited.

Client.java
item.java
item.cfg
itemhandeler.

thats it. 

5 minutes ago, i deleted all of it. took away the things i added in all the files. still the error. so im wondeering has this happened to ANYONE before? if so, i would gladly accept and educated guess&#39;s.

thanks.</description>

              <p>This has happened to me before.<br>
I added something, compiled and had NO errors.<br>
Yet what I didnt know was that code was blocking my server from starting for a reason. Delete what you added. MAKE SURE YOU DELETED every single thing you added.</p>
