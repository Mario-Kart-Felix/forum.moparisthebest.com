    <title>The server status page</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-server-status-page/220830</link>
    <description>I really don&#39;t know were to post this as i cant post this on moparisthebest.com or w-e and this is related to here so ill post it here.

I&#39;ve been wondering about the rule to &#39;do not abuse the serverstatus page&#39; as this haven&#39;t been obviously enforced. We see alot of Alcazar and that Rune w-e server being posted over and over and i thought we could only add in 1 server? Why hasn&#39;t any admin taken their banhammer and remove all these crappy but relatively good spammy servers off for abusing this rule? Really want to know why...</description>
