    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-sides-with-npcs-and-players/68299</link>
    <description>How Do You Make A NPC Attack Another NPC Or Another Character E.G. Gnomes Vs Humans And When They Attack Other NPCS HOWEVER I Want Them To Only Attack The &#39;Enemy&#39; And Only Attack &#39;Enemy&#39; Players As Im Doing This With Alienment So Zammy Guthix And Sara So If A Sara Walks Past 35 Zammy Supporting NPCS They Will Instantly Attack That Person But Aswell Attack Any NPCS They Might Come Across That Are Not On Its Side Either Contact Me On Hotmail Using My Email Or Post It Here If Its VERY Long. ( PLease Note That If A Zammy Walks Past A Zammy EVEN if its A Player And He/She Is Walking Past A War Hungry Deamon Which Would Pound him/her To Shreds WILL STILL NOT ATTACK HIM/HER For The Reason Of Them Supporting The Deamons God But Really I Want To Make &#39;Sides&#39; In Short.

Yours Thankfully In Advance,
Tythus (^_^)

P.S. Yes I Have Tryed And They Still Dont Seem To Attack?
