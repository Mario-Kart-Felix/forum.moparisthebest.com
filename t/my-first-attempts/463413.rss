    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-attempts/463413</link>
    <description>I downloaded the cs6 trial today and decided to throw my first attempts at gfx.
Here&#39;s what I made, it&#39;s just some basic shit since I&#39;m new to it.

<p>How is that a worthless comment? If you actually follow and read the tutorial and look what happens after everything you do you can learn so much faster.<br>
You guys are all saying ‘dont need to use tutorials’ because you can do it all yourself, TUTORIALS TEACH  YOU.</p>
<p>Anyways, onto the pieces.<br>
Now, I’m sorry if I offend you by my overall cnc, but I’m just being honest.</p>
<p>A piece consists of many things. Composition, atmosphere, lighting, colours, execution, flow, focal, and so much more.<br>
With your work (taking into account the face that you’re just a beginner) is lacking in almost all of these. What reading up on a few tutorials (actually reading, no just following the steps) would have taught you is how to balance your colours. It’s very very important for the aesthetic appeal of your piece. Have a look at:<br>

<p>It’s a tutorial on a simple, yet nice piece. It teaches you all the basic, from lighting to colour balancing.<br>
Also, your contrast in a lot of these really hurts my eyes, as I feel you’ve tinkered with lighting, but not the contrast/colouring.</p>
<p>I could go on, but I’ll leave it there. Your work so far isn’t good, but then it’s not bad either. Just keep up the work, and read up!</p>

It’s just, if you do something by yourself and try things in photoshop its easier to remember it as when you watch something and just do what the video says.<br>

<p>Photoshop is so complex that if you didn’t read up on it you probably would take ten years to figure out all the features. Following a tutorial means reading what it says, seeing what that does and implementing it. EG: I bet this user wouldn’t know that if you added a texture layer on subtract with low opacity you can get some very very nice effects.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>you just experiment, its not that complex lol.[/quote]</p>
<p>experiment all you want, you still won’t be able to learn all the things you could if you read up.</p>
