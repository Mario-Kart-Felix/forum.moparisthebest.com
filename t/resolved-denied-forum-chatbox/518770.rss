    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED] Forum Chatbox</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-forum-chatbox/518770</link>
    <description>I already know I am in the minority of people who will most likely post here and want a chatbox. For some reason people are really against a forum chatbox and I would love to know why. I think it would be a great addition.

Why I think the forums should have a chatbox/shoutbox:
-It allows the users to communicate in a different fashion about nearly anything
-People would remain on the forums for longer periods of time instead of posting and then getting off. They would have another reason to stay on MoparScape
-Some people (such as myself) do not like IRC.

Disadvantages to a chatbox/shoutbox:
-(I need some)



If you think it will take up a lot of space or look trashy, there could be an option to minimize it similar to a section on the forums

If you think the IRC is sufficient, look at the number of the users and guests on the forums compared to the active people in the IRC. The forum chatbox would be much more used and people would spend more time on the site. Also, IRC doesn&#39;t work on my computer for some reason and some of the people in there don&#39;t even post anymore but take time to be complete assholes in IRC.

I&#39;d love to discuss this more so feel free to post your constructive opinions.</description>

<p>The problem with IRC is no new members are ever accepted because of the community that IRC attracts. The one time i logged onto IRC i wasn’t exactly welcomed with open arms, how do you expect newer members to join and fit in with that attitude? A chatbox would allow members to communicate and not be treated differently because they’re “new” to the community. IRC just proves that having a chat system separate to mopar isn’t beneficial, how do you expect to update IRC to fit standards when people are too intimidated to join?</p>

</aside>
<p>The difference between IRC and a chatbox in this situation is time, IRC is merely an already established chatbox. Once you get members, moderators, regulars to the chatbox it will be no different, people will be flamed for asking inane questions that are answered in a dozen places etc. As for IRC being hostile, I won’t lie and say that <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> smells like roses, but in most cases the newer folk that do get flamed are usually people who tend to act with a sense of self-entitlement which just doesn’t belong on IRC. Plenty of new people come and go on <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> without incident, people just don’t hear about those cases because they aren’t there.</p>

<p>the problem with a chatbox that connects to irc is the constant join/part spam that will occur when the users browse the forums</p>

</aside>
<p>Hence why you don’t use an IRC interface that is stupid, I.E., have a chatbox proxy bot that connects to <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> (and <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> alone), or have a browser plugin that keeps the connection alive etc. Most IRC clients worth their weight have an option to hide join/part messages anyway.</p>

Both valid but I suppose you could block outside links in the chatbox to prevent that. No idea about the server issues <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>EDIT: From the number of votes you can tell the number of people who even browse this board. It’s sad that we aren’t seeing any newer members voicing their opinions at all.</p>

<p>In no way is that constructive criticism towards the suggestion at hand.</p>
<p>To the thread: IRC is a very mature and open chatting service that literally anyone is welcome to join. We have a link redirecting to a web applet for the IRC. Anyone can join, and if you at least talk with competence (by this I don’t mean say ‘hello yeah i just ate a doughnut’), then you’ll be able to stay just fine. Have patience as well, IRC isn’t as much of a live chatting service as much as it is you can talk to one person periodically, and then just hang around. When I first joined the IRC channel, I just sat for a bit then just said hello and talked about some cool things in the news. If you have a bit of patience and something to talk about, the IRC is truly a very entertaining program to use when you want to chat. Plus, the <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> channel is quite active, so if you having something to talk about that doesn’t revolve around candy or something like that, then just start talking. If you have a picture of the inside of a computer, then you’ll be able to talk in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> for quite a bit of time. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>EDIT: I’m not against the idea of a chat box as long as I could disable it.</p>

<p>but yeah I don’t know I have been thinking about the chatbox and it just wouldn’t have a “mopar feeling” I don’t think. When I ran that forum it was an okay hit but I don’t think it was as active as people really thought it was going to get.(talking about the chatbox we had)</p>

Close minded comments like this intimidates newer members, how would you feel if you logged onto a chat with older members calling you a “retard”, “moron”, or an “idiot”? I would certainly log off, i wouldn’t stick around for people to make smart, rude and diminishing comments. You can’t inform new members about how member choose to act, the community should be able to accept them. IRC doesn’t allow for that to happen, a chatbox would.[/quote]You won’t get called any of these things or treated “badly” if you show a lick of common sense and don’t act stupidly.</p>

<p>Also, I feel like irc is only used by veteran members. We need more newer, active members on the forums and I really doubt the new members are going to go to irc. Maybe i’m wrong, though.</p>

<p>There are many individuals who come to <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> and <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> and are not called a “retard”, “moron”, or “idiot” and fit in perfectly fine. You make it seem as if only new people are stupid, which is obviously not the case. Only the new people who attempt to display condescending superiority through failed attempts at false elitism and “properness” are the ones who are politely hinted to go somewhere else. But really, you will find degrading remarks in every form of media, so what is IRC to blame? nifty_'s post is not close-minded at all.</p>
