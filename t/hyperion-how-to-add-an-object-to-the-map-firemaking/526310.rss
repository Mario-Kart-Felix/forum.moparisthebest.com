    <title>[Hyperion] How to add an object to the map? (Firemaking)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-how-to-add-an-object-to-the-map-firemaking/526310</link>
    <description>Hey everyone,

I&#39;m currently working on Firemaking, and I got it clipped and everything, the only thing that needs to be done is that once he lights the fire, the fire itself needs to be placed on the ground. How would I do this?

ALSO: how would I make him move 1 step with an animation? So far I only have it that he moves 1 step, but without any animation.

I used this for it:


[code=java]player.setForceWalk(new int[]{1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 5}, false);[/code]
Help is deeply appreciated,

Regards

JavaLearner/Dylan

              <p>[quote=“Kodiak, post:2, topic:526310”]Well I don’t know how your firemaking works so I’m only gonna speak in generalization, but I’m sure you can convert etc.</p>
<p>First off incase I read your problem wrong this should only help you if by your thread you meant when you light a fire, it doesn’t create the ground object data. Anyways moving on:</p>
<p>However hyperion handles item on item, go to that class. Now directly under where it says something along the lines of useItem tinderbox on item logs you want to put something like… “createGroundItem(fire object id)” you get what I mean.</p>
<p>Now I hope that last part helped in the slightest bit or at lit put you on the right track, but for the next part:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">player.setForceWalk(new int[]{1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 5}, false);</code></pre>
<p>Tell me which numbers do what, so I can better help you.[/quote]I suppose that would create an item, not an object. Also, setForceWalk will only allow it to move one space, it has nothing to do with the animation, so I’m kind of asking for maybe another way which I can move with an animation.</p>
