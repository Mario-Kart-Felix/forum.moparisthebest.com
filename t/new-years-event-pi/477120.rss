    <description>I am looking into making a new years event.
Concept of event:
You talk to chef at lumbridge, he tells you to bring him the following:

Manta rays x25 (noted),
Rocktails x10,
Sharks x30 (noted),
and a tinderbox.

after you do so, he will give you access to a mystery box and you get a prize.

I was wondering if someone can help me with this.

Just basic Dialogue which I fail at adding for some weird reason.

Chef: Help, I fell asleep and left the New Years dinner in the oven. It&#39;s Burnt
player: Yeah, of course I can help,   or   No, you burnt it, thats your fault.
Chef:if yes - Thanks so much the foods that were burnt were, 30 sharks, 25 Manta rays and 10 Rocktails.
       if no - Very well, I&#39;m sure Excellion will help me with it.


then the players gets all those stuff gives it to the chef and then the chef returns to him a prize.

that&#39;s basically it.</description>

Not being mean or anything, but you need to learn how to do this if you want to add it into your server instead of asking people on Moparscape to provide you with the codes.<br>
[/quote]Yeah ik  :o</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Firstly, go to dialoguehandler.java and make a case. for example put<br>
Case 999:<br>
sendNpcChat(#) That number is how many lines u want the npc to have so if u want 2 it’ll be like<br>
sendNpcChat2(“LALALA”, “lalalal”);<br>
if you want more change the number to 3 or 4 is max!<br>
Also, after that, you must set the dialogue action and the nextchat<br>
Not gonna explain it all, too much</p>

sendOption2(“Yeah Sure, how can I help?”, “No, I’m not even in the mood.”)</span>[/quote]<br>
This is the part were I am getting stuck at.<br>
How Would I make these options work?</p>
<p>That’s what I have but what do I the cases, any blank case? How will I then make the chef actually speak?[/quote]You make those options work in the actionbuttons, if its winterLove, probably the cases are 9157 and 9158, but im not sure, look at the prints on the prompt</p>
