    <title>Help With Port Forward</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-port-forward/332011</link>
    <description>Hello.. Its about my brothers server again.
I got some problems with Port Forwarding..
We can&#39;t get to the ip adress..
we were going to www.ipchicken.com and got the ip.
and then we pasted it, and setted it into the toolbar..
and it says.
&quot;If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the network.&quot;..

So what do i do?, we turned firewall off already.</description>
