<p>Being a pure, EoC ruined every pure account known to mankind. I absolutely hate runescape after early 2008. All the updates were just stupid, The change of many item models, the stupid “HD” graphics after 474. Maybe I’m biased since old school RuneScape was my childhood game but whatever</p>
<p>Again, respect your opinion regardless</p>

<p>Sure maybe my opinion is better wording, but if it was just an opinion then explain to me why 80% of RuneScape basically quit after 2008? I’ll tell you why, because it was junk. You know something is wrong when there are equal (many occasions more) people playing OSRS than actual RuneScape.</p>
<p>Compare the heyday of RuneScape to maybe 2010 for example. RuneScape reached player peaks of around 250-200k on holidays and weekends. Just 2 years later you would probably see only 170-100k people. Now you pretty much get 40k on actual RuneScape.</p>
<p>The only people who would disagree with me are children who probably started in 2013, people who were trash at PKing, and people who love EoCScape.[/quote]</p>
<p>Just because people quit doesn’t make the game “not fun”. It makes it different, and besides, they retracted their terrible decision which drove their company downhill which was the wilderness update. If they hadn’t done that, the game wouldn’t have lost such a hefty amount of people in such a short time. The change in graphics may have also attributed to this.</p>
<p>Nowadays, people who had played the game in the past refer to it as “Grindscape” as better games have been made to suit their needs, games that get to the fun stuff faster(even MMOs).</p>
<p>I joined the game far before 2007, I still enjoy osrs, I enjoyed it when it was actually 2007, and I enjoy EOC aswell. At first I didn’t like RS3 when it came out, because of the new updates. I do now, because I realized I only hated it because it was not the same, I didn’t want change. But it’s good for what it is.</p>
