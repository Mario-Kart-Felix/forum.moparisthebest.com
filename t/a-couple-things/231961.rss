    <title>A couple things</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-couple-things/231961</link>
    <description>alright well i have a few problems, that im going to research further, and i though i might as well see if any1 can help me here while i search.

ok first and probaly most important. the compiler.
YES i have jdk, and no i dont really have an error. it SAYS it compiles fine, yet NO changes in my client.java file are actually being updated. thing is, i have like a month of coding in the client file, yet none of it is on. so heres where i am confused. yes i have tryed all the compilers i can find, NONE of them have worked. the server used to be hosted on my friends comp, and the compiler didnt work there either. so now i wonder, is it my source? idk, but when i go back to the file the changes and additions i put in are still there. so im pretty desperate for a compiler.

2nd thing pretty small. 
as ive seen in a bunch of servers, they have 30 minute restarts. well i need to know how to make one, or add one. after the half hour mark my computer starts to go into major lagg. and my brother isnt happy. YES i have a life, and im not going to sit home and keep restarting my server. so i need to know if that is possible for a begginer like me. this is something i havent researched yet at all, but if it turns out to be harder then i thought i want some support here :D.

thx all if you know the soultion or some help to EITHER of these. i appreciate it greatly if you reply!</description>

              <p>for your compiler problem… try right clicking your compiler and click edit. you will see the echo off and pause etc. then click file &gt; save as and when you save it as compiler make sure that it says all files under save as type. you will see it under where you change the name of the file you wish to save.</p>
