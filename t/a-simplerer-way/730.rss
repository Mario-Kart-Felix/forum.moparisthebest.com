    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-simplerer-way/730</link>
    <description>ive done a lot of bot programing and i figured it would be the easiest way to ahck rs2. if anyone has ever play yahoo chess(its java) then youll notice you cant hack but you can get auto programs, well i had designed a auto prog that read the string of data and provides with the best possible move. now for rs2 i could make a prog that scan the strands of data then it would move your unit accoringly thus making it auto, then if could create a side script to chenge the returning strings(in the packet) if it is kept the same size then the server would accept it, so for example when you raise a smithing level your packet is aprox 13.3kb(it depends on the level) now if the packet was to be edited so that you would level when your action occurs the related stat was registered as leveling, so it basically mean the prog moves you and mines and you level or it fight and you level or cooks and you level instantly in all catagories of of stats would level you, so basically you would select an option say mining, it would then move you to an open piece of ore and it would mine it, and you would level just like that, it would then move to the next availible(and with preshadowing it would go the the one that is next availibe if none are imidatle availible) and level you again, so you could set it up in a order mine to level 99, cook to level 99 fish to level 99 magic to level 50 or how ever you want to do it, it would carry out the actions in order untill it is done now the only thing youll have to worry about is items

so what do you guys think(please only comments from coders)

im posting this becasue sean told me about your attempts wich i tryed to do for over a year(i kept getting though security but they would update before i could code for an hack)

please excuse my spelling im really tired last night... but im staying up to play moparscape with sean.

let me know what you think</description>

</aside>
<p>It works fine if you intercept in the right place and make sure that you change the packet header to the proper header (and of course the params/arguments to the proper values as well). Keep in mind that the header has been modified by the client. All they use is an array that is populated with various int values. These int values are added to the original packet id. The client and server use the same modifier values so they are in synch. Meaning: the server sends the client packets with the same modification values so the client can subtract off the current index in that array. When the client wants to send something, it adds that value at the current index and increments the index. If you know the value the client used to modify the packet header, you can very easily change that portion of the packet so that the server will accept the incoming packet. That is only to get the server to accept it. That says nothing about how detectable that method is. (It is very unsafe to do that). Really, the only real reason to exploit something like that is for a dupe/item creation method. Outside of that, there is no real use for it in botting terms.</p>
<p>All this in mind, it is not enough to simply <span class="bbcode-i">know</span> what modifier will be next. You have to look at the code and see exactly what the client does when it sends game data via packets. It does not simply send a solo packet signifying some action. All actions are preceded by some important information. (A small amount of research will yield you this information). You not only have to send the packet but you also have to build the “frame” that the server is expecting on each and every single solitary action you could possibly perform. If you do something out of sequence, you will not have that character very long.</p>

              <p>Been said before, but just to make it clear, a rule of thumb is that you can’t do with a packet bot anything that you couldn’t do yourself with only the standard client. (Exploits are the exception but we can just omit these). Also, although it is possible to make a packet or even a proxy bot (I am making a packet bot myself), it is not exactly simple, and you can get an idea of why by reading Krichevskoy post (which is 100% right). Believe it or not, getting through the obstacles he describes, is nonetheless, the easy part (At least for making a full packet bot, not a proxy one).</p>

              <p>A short lesson in RuneScape protocol.<br>
At first glance, you appear to have a link set up like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">client &lt;----&gt; server</code></pre>
<p>and that leads many people to believe that the server uses information from the client in some way. This has led to any number of farfetched schemes that might give you a good screenshot at best.</p>
<p>In reality, the link is more like this<br>
server —&gt; <img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/8800/hump7xh.gif" alt width="" height=""> &lt;— client<br>
The client just takes it. Nothing there but a 3D graphics system and some mouse logging.</p>
<p>Now for the really fun part - the encryption.<br>
RuneScape protocol is partially encrypted. The data is untouched, but the command ID of each packet is scrambled by adding a random number drawn from (iirc) an <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ISAAC</a> generator. This generator uses as its seed a session key which is established in a two part handshake sort of arrangement. The final initialization numbers are transmitted in the same packet as the login data, under asymmetric RSA encryption which we cannot practically crack. There is no known way to determine what the next number will be without the seed.</p>
<blockquote>ISAAC hasn't been broken since it was published 9 years ago. No bias has been detected either. I am offering these prizes in an attempt to get others to try to break it and assure those techniques are published. Apologies for having such a small prize. If you find successful attacks or biases in smaller versions of ISAAC, I'll include them in isaac.html, even though there are no prizes for them. I'm interested in attacks and biases against RC4 as well. Other fast stream ciphers are SEAL and WAKE.</blockquote>
It only works because both client and server are using RNGs running in parallel - they are initialized at the same time and every packet that is encoded on one side must be decoded on the other, so the arrays stay synchronized. If you were to inject packets into the stream without working through the client interface, thus without access to the RNG, the server-side RNG will be misaligned and the resulting linkdeath will make it quite difficult for your bot to function.

look it very simple, every time you move you rs windows will send a packet to the server informing you of what you did and how much xp/your hit for, then the server will respond with what should happen now(ex. iron in inv,congratulaions your mining is now level 15,ect) so if the packet said you just gained 500 xp, you would gain 500 xp, and the server would inform you if that was a level or not<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>but the runescape server is very secure, if you send a packet saying “hey, I got 500xp over here” the server is going to go “wtf, how the hell did you get 500xp, your not even standing next to all those rocks, and you didnt click on them, SCREW YOU HACKER” and then you will get banned ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>okay so fuck the hacking il just make the auto, i know i can do that.</p>

</aside>
<p>No. You do not send the exp gaining packets to the server. You just send things like “I want to mine that rock on x,y”. The server will then check if you have enought levels to do it (server side), it will check if you have got a pickaxe for it (server side). Later it will tell you when the rock turns empty, and add the ore to your backpack and give you your new xp value (server side).</p>

<li>first rune runescape client(donwloadable at runescape site)</li>
<li>then login</li>
<li>now run the program</li>
<li>it will autodetect your client window and move next to it</li>
<li>your can modify the level settings(what level to level to, ex. cooking 99, that would level cooking to 99)</li>
<li>go do something else untill it finishes</li>
</ol>
<p>now here what is happening behind the scenes</p>
<ol>
<li>subset values locate the program</li>
<li>moves to the box inorder to get movement control(allows it to move you and click around)</li>
<li>read the values for your settings, reads map and determines the location nearest you and heads for it</li>
<li>upon attack/action captures packet sent back(to inform server of hit) and changes the code to say enough xp was gained for a level</li>
<li>sends packet and then presses okay on the congrats thing</li>
<li>repeats until all settings have been completed</li>
<li>then commences to do the final value(can be set to mine, cook, fight, anything, so you can collect supplies) and will do that until you stop it</li>

Mmm What? That makes no sense, you can’t edit anything the server controls… EG- XP/Levelling<br>

Or that’s what we know… Maybe he has got something in mind, but I really doubt it will work.</p>
<p>I remember in Kaitnieks there was someone who said he could go to members areas on free servers with his client hack… He got flamed so much and he was about to leave Kaitnieks forums on the same day :P[/quote]That was me and my friend jeff who did that. We got everthing to work but loading new area.</p>

              <blockquote>ive done a lot of bot programing and i figured it would be the easiest way to ahck rs2. if anyone has ever play yahoo chess(its java) then youll notice you cant hack but you can get auto programs, well i had designed a auto prog that read the string of data and provides with the best possible move. now for rs2 i could make a prog that scan the strands of data then it would move your unit accoringly thus making it auto, then if could create a side script to chenge the returning strings(in the packet) if it is kept the same size then the server would accept it, so for example when you raise a smithing level your packet is aprox 13.3kb(it depends on the level) now if the packet was to be edited so that you would level when your action occurs the related stat was registered as leveling, so it basically mean the prog moves you and mines and you level or it fight and you level or cooks and you level instantly in all catagories of of stats would level you, so basically you would select an option say mining, it would then move you to an open piece of ore and it would mine it, and you would level just like that, it would then move to the next availible(and with preshadowing it would go the the one that is next availibe if none are imidatle availible) and level you again, so you could set it up in a order mine to level 99, cook to level 99 fish to level 99 magic to level 50 or how ever you want to do it, it would carry out the actions in order untill it is done now the only thing youll have to worry about is items
<p>so what do you guys think(please only comments from coders)</p>
<p>im posting this becasue sean told me about your attempts wich i tryed to do for over a year(i kept getting though security but they would update before i could code for an hack)</p>
<p>please excuse my spelling im really tired last night… but im staying up to play moparscape with sean.</p>
<p>let me know what you think</p>

<p>Runescape has supreme protection against packet sending and packet editing cheats, for good reason.</p>
<p>Good luck, try making it, tell us how it goes, and then we can say more. Your ideas are too vague.</p>
