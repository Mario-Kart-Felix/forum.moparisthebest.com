<p>Thus some people that do have more advanced java knowledge may find it insulting that you try to extend your understandings beyond what you do, when you argue or try to ‘explain off’ constructive criticism.

<p>Anything else you have to say?</p>
<p>Then sorry to disappoint you. I never knew you two were in a position to have an opinion and say of who and who cannot have a reward for effort. Do some research on the purpose of this specific cup. Travis never said it was for java, he said it was for RSPS a very long time ago. I’m not going to find the post and I’m sure you won’t look anyway.</p>
<p>So here’s an idea, don’t even speak of it anymore. If you’re not going to try be in an empathetic situation where you say that you want to give the cup a go, then the foundation of your argument is cracked.</p>
<p>It’s embarrassing to you. How many people, other than a few of you, actually understand most of the reasons of why you are embarrassed? Barely anyone. So as a suggestion, stop trying so hard to give them a reason.</p>

<p>More or less, I’m in it to learn now. So egos put aside, I don’t really care if you want to call yourself a guru of anything on a forum. I have better occupations in life than to be obsessed with expectations that I obviously don’t meet. So please, continue with your belligerent rants of calling me stupid if it makes you feel better about a situation I really don’t enjoy hearing about when coming on here.</p>
