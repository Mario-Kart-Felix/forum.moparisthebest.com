    <title>*Ice Cube- 1st Degree Burner* -Made By Me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ice-cube-1st-degree-burner-made-by-me/14899</link>
    <description>*disclaimer- I take no responsibility for the actions you take after reading this post and i declare that this is for educational purposes only*

ok here we go

For this little project we will need:

1.) Ice Cubes
2.) Can of Mortons Salt

Many people think of ice, as a beverage cooler and not a deadly weapon, most people think of salt as a topping, harmful only to your arteries, how wrong they are... Ice and salt- bonnie and clyde, the silent killers of your freezer and table... heres how to unleash the pain..

1. Take an ice cube, put in the opposite hand you write with.
2. Take can of salt, put in your primary hand.
3. Pour salt on ice, make sure that it is even all over, DO NOT TOUCH!
4. place on some type of skin, within two seconds it will cause a minor burn, within 60 seconds, the skin will be scarred for life.

Most teens remember this as the chicken type game of salt and ice, it can be used as a deadly weapon, remember. HAVE FUN!

<p>ok here we go</p>
<p>For this little project we will need:</p>
<p>1.) Ice Cubes<br>
2.) Can of Mortons Salt</p>
<p>Many people think of ice, as a beverage cooler and not a deadly weapon, most people think of salt as a topping, harmful only to your arteries, how wrong they are… Ice and salt- bonnie and clyde, the silent killers of your freezer and table… heres how to unleash the pain…</p>
<ol>
<li>Take an ice cube, put in the opposite hand you write with.</li>
<li>Take can of salt, put in your primary hand.</li>
<li>Pour salt on ice, make sure that it is even all over, DO NOT TOUCH!</li>
<li>place on some type of skin, within two seconds it will cause a minor burn, within 60 seconds, the skin will be scarred for life.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most teens remember this as the chicken type game of salt and ice, it can be used as a deadly weapon, remember. HAVE FUN!</p>
