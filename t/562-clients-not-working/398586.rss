    <title>[562] Clients Not Working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-clients-not-working/398586</link>
    <description>Hey. I recently just downloaded GazaaScape, and I&#39;m trying to make a webclient. Whenever I use any client to connect, it just won&#39;t work. I&#39;ve edited the IP to my current IP, 127.0.0.1, and 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.100. None of those work with any other clients I download. But when I use the GazaaScape client, it works great. The only problem is that JARMaker won&#39;t make a webclient with the GazaaScape client for some reason. The .jar file won&#39;t open. I can make webclients with the other clients that I download though.

If I use any other client, I also get this error message.

&lt;blockquote&gt;log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.mina.filter.executor.ExecutorFilter).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It only happens when the other client tries to connect. If I run the server and do nothing, then the error message doesn&#39;t appear. But when I run the client, it gives me that error message.

In the client cmd, I also get the error_game_js5connect message, but I know that it&#39;s because it can&#39;t connect. So no problem with that. Just not sure if that will help anything.

Edit: I&#39;ve also port forwarded.</description>

<p>Go to <a href="http://www.canyouseeme.org/">http://www.canyouseeme.org/</a><br>
Type in your server port in the box<br>
Click “Check”<br>
If at the bottom it says “I cannot see you” then the port isn’t forwarded.</p>
