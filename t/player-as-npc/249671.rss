    <title>Player as NPC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-as-npc/249671</link>
    <description>Ok i had no idea how to go about it so instead of brainstorming i thought id just post a quick topic
My current code turns a player into an npc if they click an action and are wearing a certain item, but, the stay this way until they logout.

I want to change so as soon as they WALK away from where they r standing or remove the item the go back to thier normal selves. I would really prefer to have it so as soon as they walk it cahnges back

Current code = 
[code]       if ((playerEquipment[playerCape] == 2680) || (playerEquipment[playerCape] == 4359)) { //stength untrimmed
			npcId = 1289;
			npcId2 = npcId;
			isNpc = true;
			specGFX(255);
			plrText = &quot;I can bench a lot with my strength!&quot;;
			plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
			updateRequired = true;
			appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
       }[/code][br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 09, 2008, 03:07:38 pm[/size][hr]ok im 1 sec closer,
at the bottom i added

[code]else {
setAnimation(0x35A);
			isNpc = false;
			updateRequired = true;
			appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}
}
[/code]

This just means if the click the action button without the item on they return to normal, does anyone have any ideas on how to get what i need?</description>
