              <p>Thanks for the info. Any other suggestions? Like for example, I spent about a week working with Richscape v2, just to find out when players connect to it my computer crashes. Which is strange since my computer is fairly good. 2GB of RAM and a AMD Athlon X2 4200+ 2.2GHz processor. So suggestions on that?</p>

<blockquote>Here's the 2nd release of my rs2 server framework.
This one supports multiplayer, chat, movement, and map loading. Source is pretty self explanatory.
<p>It’s been tested with &gt;350 players on concurrently with no problems. Feature-wise it’s pretty bare, so you’ll have to add that yourself. I don’t know how rs2 works so I can’t really add anything.</p>
<p>In terms of scalability, this thing wipes the floor with any winterlove based server. Anyone looking to do some real coding should definitely use this base. No more fucking about with client.java and huge switch statements.</p>

<a href="http://evil.gotdns.org/servers/rs2dv.rar" rel="nofollow noopener">http://evil.gotdns.org/servers/rs2dv.rar</a> (Hosted on Evil_'s computer, only works when he’s online, he’s on most of the time)</p>
<p>Included scripts for running + building (linux and windows), a readme, the source, and the required libraries.<br>
Changed 26th Dec:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a few convenience methods.</li>
<li>Added running with ctrl held down in the client (thanks Lothy).</li>
<li>Added range checks for PlayerAppearance.</li>
<li>Added a scripting configuration system, which was more something fun than something actually useful. The example scripts are in etc/<br>
Changed 26th Dec <span class="hashtag">#2:</span>
</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with ctrl + running</li>
<li>Added xstream to the library for persistence, and net.varek.rs2d.io.XMLPersist</li>
</ul>
<p>Again I state: This is not a completed server, just a beautiful framework.</p>

              <p>Well exactly, some sources obviously will be better than others. Which ones are superior? I was using richscape v2 source, since he was finished with his server. But I think it is a faulty source, because my comp crashes when I let people connect, and private servers have never done that to me before.</p>
