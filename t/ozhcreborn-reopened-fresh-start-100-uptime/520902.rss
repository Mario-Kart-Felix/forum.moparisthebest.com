[size=18pt]Welcome to OzhcReborn![/size]

OzhcReborn Forums - [url=http://board.ozhcreborn.com]http://board.ozhcreborn.com[/url]
OzhcReborn Play Now - [url=http://www.ozhcreborn.com/play.php]www.ozhcreborn.com/play.php[/url]

To start off the introduction, we withhold the name &#39;OzhcReborn&#39;. The reason for having &#39;Reborn&#39; in our name is because we are not a &quot;new&quot; server. Ozhc has been around since January of 2011. As many of you know, we started out with the name of OzhcScape. Now we are back in business and ready to succeed in becoming one of the top RSPS. Ozhc wants to be known as one of the best private servers out there, and you can help us achieve that. We have no doubts that this server will become very populated and and well known in the near future. Ozhc is still under the same management as it was in January of 2011; not to be worried, there are many moderator positions to be filled as we grow numerously.

Many thanks to all of the previous members that support us and hopefully will still support us. We would love to see all of our old members join us again on a journey to success. Also, a huge thanks to all of the new members that plan on joining. There will be plentiful opportunities for our members in the future.

OzhcReborn Staff Team

- Shops are spread out throughout buildings in varrock. You can find your necessities in any shop.

- Low level training. This can be for new-comers as rock crabs are one of the easiest monsters to kill in Ozhc.
