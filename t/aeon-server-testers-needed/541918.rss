    <title>Aeon ~ Server testers needed!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/aeon-server-testers-needed/541918</link>
    <description>Hello everyone. Lil_Smoker and I are creating a server called Aeon. During testing it&#39;s going to stay Hamachi. We need 2-3 testers to help test the game. These testers will be rewarded with items and (maybe staff positions). These testers will be given the items they need to test. If you&#39;re interested, please PM me. I don&#39;t have to put screenies. If you don&#39;t want to trust us, don&#39;t download and play. Testers that, ironically, do not test will be ip-banned for as long as the server is in testing mode. In addition, I expect a list of things that need done by next Saturday, 4/12/14. PM me for more info.</description>

              <p>There isn’t a place to post a thread that exclusively pertains to gathering beta testers on the forums, so I’m afraid I’ll have to lock this thread. Feel free to create a server development thread and throw in a little tidbit about gathering beta testers there, though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
