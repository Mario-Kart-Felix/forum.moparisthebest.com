    <description>Edit: This tutorial will be on moparisthebest Graphic tutorials forum now too :D

Ok, I was bored today, and decided to make a tutorial that wasn&#39;t based on anything really related with clients and stuff. Instead, I wanted it to be about a program i know and love called Apophysis. It allows you to create fractals, which are rather amazing images that i suppose are abstract to an extent. Anyways, I haven&#39;t seen anything about them yet here on moparscape forums, so i decided that i even wanted to post a tutorial :) I will supply the download links at the end.

[center]A Basic Tutorial to Apophysis
By Rip4d[/center]

First off, there are two versions of Apophysis, regular and the 3D &quot;Hack&quot;. Both are similar, but each one has something the other doesn&#39;t, like Pokemon games. Now, I will begin the tutorial officially :)

[Step 1 -- Open Apophysis]

When you open Apohysis, a random batch will come up (I think there are 100 the first time you open it, I changed mine to 1 but in all honesty i forget how). The image is different every time, but it won&#39;t matter. You&#39;re going to change it! Here is what it should look like:

Typically they are rather ugly, but they can sometimes look decent :D

[Step 2 -- Using the Flame Editor and Adjustments]

[IMG]http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l214/lionray/ApT2.png[/img]

Simply follow the picture above, and the Flame Editor and Adjustments windows should pop up. (Note, many of the images already have text in them, so there might not be as much regular typing [as i am now] than in most other tutorials)

Now you should have a new Flame. Now simply follow the pictures; they should show you everything :)

[Step 3 -- Rendering (Saving) Your Fractal]

[IMG]http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l214/lionray/ApT13.png[/img]
Yes, I have saved a fractal with a quality of i think 2000 or 4000 that had taken over an hour to fully render. It shouldn&#39;t take up any more space than a lower quality image, it just takes longer to save.

Now that your image is rendered, you will have your finished product! The fractals will have transparent backgrounds, and will typically have a higher quality than while you are editing the flame. The finished product of this flame:

Tadaa! :D

I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and also potentially inspired to make your own fractals :) Good luck, and thanks for reading!

It was pretty easy to put together too. I might actually make one going indepth on the base variations and the different settings you can use. Maybe even a 3D hack one too.</p>
