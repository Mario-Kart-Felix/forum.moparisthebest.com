    <description>Okay, i want to make it so when i use a dye with a white partyhat, i get that colored partyhat.  I saw a tut on how to do this a while back and it was called something like &quot;using one item with another item to give you a certain item&quot;  If anyone can find me a tut or tell me how to do that, ill be very grateful
