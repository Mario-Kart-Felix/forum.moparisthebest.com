    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;BRIDGEPORT, Pa. - One man is dead and another in jail after what police say was an argument over a drinking game that escalated into a fatal shooting.

Investigators in suburban Philadelphia say 24-year-old Joseph Jimenez shot and killed 25-year-old Scott Riley after they started arguing over a game of beer pong at a party Friday night in Bridgeport, about 15 miles outside Philadelphia.

Authorities say the two men began arguing during the party and then met up outside, where Riley mocked Jimenez and challenged him to shoot.

According to a police complaint, Jimenez drew a concealed .40-caliber handgun and fired, striking Riley in the neck. Riley was taken to a hospital, where he died.

Jimenez is being held without bail on first- and third-degree murder charges.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If I know every one had a gun, I would shoot you before robbing you. But without legalizing of gun I could rob you without fear for being shoot and the would not get much damage.</p>
<p>So that can be an other consequence for everybody have a gun on the street.</p>

<p>It’s a bit too late for that in America, most families have a gun there, and I doubt they’ll all give them back. Hopefully they all shoot themselves.</p>

</aside>
<p>…On the playground where I spent most of my days<br>
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool<br>
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school<br>
When a couple of guys said were up in no good<br>
Started making trouble in my neighbourhood<br>
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
And said youre moving with your aunte and uncle in bel-air</p>
<p>I begged and pleaded with her the other day<br>
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way<br>
She gave me a kissin and she gave me my ticket<br>
I put my walkman on and said I might aswell kick it</p>
<p>First class, yo this is bad,<br>
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass<br>
Is this what the people of bel-air livin like,<br>
Hmm this might be alright!</p>
<p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near the<br>
Licensplate said fresh and had a dice in the mirror<br>
If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br>
But I thought now forget it, yo home to bel-air</p>
<p>I pulled up to a house about seven or eight<br>
And I yelled to the cabby yo, home smell you later<br>
Looked at my kingdom I was finally there<br>
To settle my throne as the prince of bel-air</p>
<p>Sorry, just had to do that</p>

<p>Investigators in suburban <span class="bbcode-b">Philadelphia</span> say 24-year-old Joseph Jimenez shot and killed 25-year-old Scott Riley after they started arguing over a game of beer pong at a party Friday night in Bridgeport, about 15 miles outside Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Authorities say the two men began arguing during the party and then met up outside, where Riley mocked Jimenez and challenged him to shoot.</p>
<p>According to a police complaint, Jimenez drew a concealed .40-caliber handgun and fired, striking Riley in the neck. Riley was taken to a hospital, where he died.</p>
<p>Jimenez is being held without bail on first- and third-degree murder charges.[/quote]<br>
