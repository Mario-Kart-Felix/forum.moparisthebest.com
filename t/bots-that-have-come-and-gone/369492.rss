    <title>Bots that have come and gone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bots-that-have-come-and-gone/369492</link>
    <description>Just happened to be thinking about RS bots, descriptions, and what I remember happening to them... Correct / add / comment / nostalgiate etc.

From my knowledge this is the rough chronology:

AutoRune - Had some protocol hax, Jagex made RS send packets which made this type of bot very difficult. (My understanding may be off here, I arrived as Kaitnieks was dying).

SCAR - Color picker, still works. Dumped by Kaitnieks, eventually went to Freddy who made SCAR Divi versions, went from a bunch of crappy includes to SRL which pretty much encompassed them all. Then nobody really cared about SRL anymore. SIMBA released as open replacement for SCAR. (I think DIVI development is still active, not sure). Lots of screwing around with terrible scripts that barely work and trying to find the right color values for colors which are changed on every client load...

Aryan - Java bot, not exactly sure how it worked, but this is basically how I started learning Java. Had some nifty functionality to tell you if Jagex was watching, apparently mass-ban due to sabotage. Cue spinoffs with botnets and such. Many scripts to do pretty much anything.

SBot3 - Pretty sure this was an Aryan spinoff, very vague memory. I also remember some &#39;luke&#39; person at this time.

ARGA - I was here for this but I completely forgot what it was. Maybe this was the name of RSR&#39;s bot?

RS-Resources - Another Java bot, this one used BCEL. Worked pretty well until the community fell to crap. Script variety / bot capability was pretty good.

RSBot - Java bot, also went pretty well until some shit happened to the community (I was absent when it broke apart, someone explain?)

Zetabot - never got out of Beta due to legal threats.

Powerbot - An RSBot ripoff that appears to still be active, community seems to be run by morons though.

Nexus/iBot/whatever - I have no idea, never bothered checking out ruler&#39;s bots. I gather that one is a Java bot and the other is SCAR-like in Java? Also a billion bot names going around with one script. (I know this is out of order, I believe his bots have been on/off for a long period of time).

Also a billion people making their own Java bots except never getting past the Canvas hook. Oh, and some site that sells Mage Training Arena bots or something.

Edit: Original post left unmodified, but here are some contributions:

Powerbot/RSbot:

[ul][li](Addendum) Speljohan: Powerbot == RSBot, they just renamed it to avoid legal troubles with jagex threatening them.[/li][/ul]


SBot3:

[ul][li](Correction) Uriko: sbot3 was made when rs2 was just coming out of beta, how was it an aryan spinoff?[/li][/ul]


Ares:

[ul][li](Addendum) Speljohan: You also missed the very short-lived Ares which Ollie wrote. Shortly after i joined the project and we released  a really really really shitty pay-version.. good times[/li][/ul]</description>

<p>He has been steadily rewriting it as he goes, though. I’m not sure if he ever plans to rewrite the bot entirely (or write a new one), but he does have plans to rework or rewrite quite a bit more of the bot.</p>

<p>RSBuddy is by Jacmob and is distributed through a jar file. Do you mean EpicBot? That’s the only one I can think of that’s distributed in an executable, and I believe it’s developed by qauters.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:12, topic:369492”]ARGA was the work of Taios/Greeny/maybe Ollie among others? Certainly Taios to say the least. Don’t know how far it got.</p>
<p>Nexus/Ibot started out as a colour clicking bot, and now makes use of reflection.</p>
<p>The Aryan sabotage was basically the sending of a negative UID, right? And that was Kamu’s/eXemplar’s doing?</p>
<p>In short, as much as I hate to admit it, SCAR/SRL and Nexus/Ibot have been the only viable long-term bots.<br>
The bottom line is that those two are the only two public bots which have been in it for the long haul.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the go is with SCAR right now, or why Freddy bothers to continue with it (presuming he is – he certainly said that he would despite Simba being in direct competition with him). I’d personally like to see it die out given that Simba is an open source project; Freddy was a tight arse with SCAR’s source.[/quote]</p>
<p>Me, Zappacky, Iamadam :). After the initial release we took it for an entire re-write, and the new version was very stunning, unfortunate we didn’t just release everything at the end for other’s to continue but life got in the way.</p>
<p>If i can dig it up i’ll post it, doubt it will be of much use now but it may help some ideas for the future.</p>
<p>Zappacky started CMU University at the age of 16, Adam got some massive award in australia and went to University, I started A levels and am now at University :).</p>
<p>[quote=“Greeny, post:37, topic:369492”][quote author=Lothy link=topic=465621.msg3405877#msg3405877 date=1290306199]<br>
Okay, so if Greeny/Ollie weren’t involved with developing the bot directly, they were at least involved in the RSR community right? Or has somebody been slipping me crazy pills?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>No, no crazy pills, you’re right.</p>
<p>Hehe incidentally, I’ve just found a google docs document I published about 3 years ago</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>That was when we restructured, so everything there is how RSR ended up if people are interested in the back story.</p>
<p>I was never involved with the bot development of ARGA that was kept between Taios, Zappacky and Iamadam (virtualmaster helped with the Aryan spin-off previous to ARGA) These four made “Macrosoft”. Pplsuqbawlz offered a lot of guidance and help too. He was admin as well prior to the above staff restructuring.</p>
<p>I don’t recall Holic as an admin, but as a moderator although I could be wrong. It would make sense for him to remember the alpha version of ARGA which he described though as that was released to the staff and older users at one point.</p>
<p>The Aryan spin-off had some differences, we had benland100 come over and help us write some “Sbot3 like” mouse movement because if you remember Aryan famously forced actions down the servers throat like a 12" dong. There were others my memory is just lacking.</p>
<p>p00flake once appeared at RSR and Taios made him admin iirc. Messy times :D[/quote]</p>
<p>Ppbsuqbawlz gave some occasionally useful, but very vague tips to us we had to interpret in our own way at times. Never did any coding. Without him however we probably wouldnt have used bytecode or bcel since it was he i believe who pushed us to do so.</p>
<p>Chats with Semephore were always very good! Very interesting person with lots of interesting information and ideas.</p>
<p>Benelands mouse movements were damn sexy!</p>
