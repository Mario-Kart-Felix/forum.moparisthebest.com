Ill say it again. “Most” isn’t good enough when you are weighing it against the reasons for requiring SSL, which are nonexistant for this IRC.</p>
<p>Let’s make a little chart to make it really simple:</p>
<h1>Reasons for SSL for IRC</h1>
<ul>
<li>Can talk about frank_ without being put on a NSA list</li>
<li>Literally nothing else because the IRC server rules already say it doesn’t condone illegal activities</li>
</ul>
<h1>Cons of forcing SSL for IRC</h1>
<ul>
<li>Active people run into annoying issues (already had a couple post here)</li>
<li>People that want to try to use their own clients may not see this thread</li>
<li>Sometimes annoying to set up even for those that can get it to work<br>

<p>I agree with David. If the data or information over the wire is that sensitive, use a secure channel of communication. I also cannot connect and don’t feel like installing the OpenSSL libraries just to get my client to work. Most of the userbase that would use the IRC, besides <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, are now at a loss and probably won’t try and connect at all now after getting an error three to five times in a row.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The only IRC client that I know of that requires a separate OpenSSL install is mIRC and that client is AIDS, sounds like it’s time to switch to a modern client if you really can’t be asked to download and install an executable. And as stated, the non-<span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> userbase mostly connects via web-IRC which has always been TLS-enabled.</p>
<p>Also, if you don’t have the intelligence to comprehend the RFC compliant “Please use TLS (SSL) to connect to this IRC network on port 6697” error then you might have a significant mental handicap. Or alternatively if correcting 1-2 lines of your configuration is too much of a hassle then IRC wasn’t that important to you anyway.</p>

        <p>The network staff agreed on seeing this through and the majority of users either wanted TLS or didn’t care. I believe the intention was to guarantee that the transmission of the chat and account passwords were secure across the entire network. If people want to share logs, record logs, or whatever I don’t care and there’s no way we could enforce such a thing. The point, I think, is to protect against passive on-lookers such as places of work or education, or insecure public networks. Imagine if someone was unfortunate enough to use an e-mail address and password for the IRC account registration which was also used on something like Amazon, or a bank.</p>

<p>I think you’re over complicating the extra step considering moparscapers (who mostly use the web client) don’t have to deal with it and the <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> userbase is only missing about 3 people who mostly idled on bouncers and haven’t updated their configuration yet. Hell, even a group of about 6 people who don’t use <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> or <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> have updated their configurations within 36 hours of the change and are (i presume) happily chatting away in their private channel.</p>

It actually was broken (in concept), having partial TLS makes no sense on a network that only really has one active channel… (ps, setting the channel to +z would require individually kicking all of the non-TLS clients and then setting the channel mode and would probably result in the same discussion). Also, nothing was added… something was removed… with an error message so in a way deprecated <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>People could have already used SSL if they were worried about their work/school sniffing out their connection… enforcing it doesn’t change that at all. The only thing enforcing it for everyone does is make sure that what you say <span class="bbcode-u">publicly</span> can’t be sniffed out on the receiving end of someone elses unsecured client, which I think it’s stupid.</p>

… or in a private message if the other end isn’t TLS.[/quote]so now we’re back to people talking about sensitive information on IRC, lol. I guess that is the one good thing about this change then, you can be sure when private messaging someone that your super secret messages aren’t being sniffed out by a potential security breach on their side in case you weren’t careful enough to check if they were secure before sending sensitive information. Personally I wouldn’t even trust that the current server host doesn’t read it all anyway, but hey.</p>

<p>being completely sarcastic, ssl for our irc is probably one of the most stupid ideas i’ve ever heard of.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>you’re literally the reason why websites in 2015 think it’s okay to not have https :^)</p>
<p>on a serious note, drugs and other very unsavoury topics(legality depending on country) are frequently discussed in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> - we can’t enforce channel-specific ssl unless everyone in the channel is using ssl, ergo unelss we want to alienate people from <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> with no clear reason as to why, being less transparent than not being able to connect to the server without proper ssl support, server-wide enforced ssl is the better option</p>
<p>it’s not even a matter of ‘it’s all public anyway’, wireless connections are inherently insecure to the point where anyone with the wifi password can snoop on plaintext communications with almost zero effort, brute-forcing wifi passwords is almost a trivial affair but I digress, and any network admin will have the capability to snoop on traffic, so someone knowing you’re in the channel or even joining the channel by fluke and realising they know someone isn’t anywhere near as bad as someone snooping on the data (usually illegally, I might add) and finding out that someone else on the network is talking about, or being complacent with people talking about sometimes illegal, sometimes legal but still unsavoury things</p>
<p>it’s EXTREMELY easy to dismiss these ideas as paranoia and issues that aren’t going to affect anyone, and in 99% of cases I’d agree, and go as far as to say <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> not being ssl only isn’t going to affect anyone (and if ssl helps with that, there’s always people we don’t know idling in the channel anyway), but plenty of people in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> connect from work (but not necessarily using work connections), plenty of people in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> connect from countries where frequent discussions may be about things that not everyone will relate to, all it takes is someone snooping on private (but essentially ‘public’) connections to land someone in the shit for it</p>

<p>definitely worth alienating an even larger portion of potential users, A+ change, would change again.</p>

</aside>
<p>as t4 mentioned, 90% of the original people have reconnected, we’re missing maybe 4-5 people in a 40~ channel, and <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> is about as dead as it ever was, of the people that can’t connect it’s a config issue and once we have a proper cert, the barrier to entry is literally using the correct port and accepting ssl - something 99% of clients can do (and that most people who can read and use google can figure out)</p>
<p>the thing with alienating more potential users is that some people just inherently don’t get irc, if you’ve ever been in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> or <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> and had people join, ask something, wait a minute, flame everyone and leave, you’ll know what I mean (I even made a topic about this a few months ago) - this issue isn’t exclusive to mitb, I’ve been in a lot of irc channels recently and it’s a fairly common problem, even in more technical channels where I wouldn’t expect people to act like children</p>
<p>people treat irc like a webchat app and see that there’s 50-100-200 people connected and think that there’s, say, 200 people actively in the chat, because hey, who would ever be afk in a chat app, and if they ask a question and don’t get a response (or worse, they’re ignored), they’re not going to take too kindly to the idea and leave, there’s just a lot of nuance to irc that many people don’t understand ranging from 200 person channels being dead for hours, to 4-6 people in a 40 person channel having 2-3 separate discussions that are moving VERY quickly to the point where it’s impossible to keep up with 2 discussions and god forbid you want to participate in both - we always have these types of situations in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> and it’s very difficult to join in</p>

</aside>
<p>the problem with letting people choose ssl is meaningless as channels can’t enforce ssl only, or use ssl, so long as one person isn’t using ssl, and it leads to a false sense of security when pming someone and ssl isn’t enabled</p>
<p>and it’s easy to talk about <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> as a useless chat, but as I mention we frequently discuss unsavoury topics ranging from drugs to guns and gay marriage, some things that people may have an opinion on in a forum or irc, but not necessarily be keen to the idea of people snooping on and finding out</p>
<p>for what it’s worth, some web filters block lgbt support websites and the like, and certainly have the ability to log instances of it behind the scenes, and in this situation it <em>has</em> landed people in bad situations, and while the average age of people in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> isn’t anywhere near as young as it once was it’s still not a nice thought to have</p>

<p>it’s not always about “if it’s sensitive, do it securely”, things like forum posts and accounts are somewhat anonymous if you use unique usernames and email addresses, despite being public, but all it takes is someone snooping on your connection to remove any sense of anonymity or privacy (with zero transparency as to this)</p>

<p>just putting this out there - my largely non-technical friend who never used irc before I asked him to use irc when msn shut down, using hexchat (with a little help to setup), managed to enable ssl on his own with an extremely simple explanation of how to enable it “go to settings, change port to 6697, enable ssl and allow invalid certificates”</p>
<p>if someone on the forums is at the point where they’ve got an irc client but can’t connect, they can still use the webclient, or better yet, come to this topic and ask for help directly</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:18, topic:553592”]Ill say it again. “Most” isn’t good enough when you are weighing it against the reasons for requiring SSL, which are nonexistant for this IRC.</p>

<li>Can talk about frank_ without being put on a NSA list</li>
<li>Literally nothing else because the IRC server rules already say it doesn’t condone illegal activities[/quote]</li>
</ul>
<p>this is getting to be a long post and I’ve explained some issues above, but for a summary:</p>
<p>-not condoning illegal activities doesn’t preclude discussion about said activities<br>
-discussions, while legal (depending on country), and while public (more on this below), might not be acceptable on work or school computers with firewalls in place<br>
-while public, there is largely an anonymity aspect to everything people do online so long as you’re using unique usernames, and emails where applicable, and while being in the public doesn’t guarantee privacy, there’s some expectation to privacy between separated accounts<br>
-again while public, snooping on traffic (usually illegally) is usually the complete opposite of transparency, and someone who isn’t even taking part in the discussion may have action taken against them depending on school/work/etc policies</p>
<h1>[quote=“Davidi2, post:18, topic:553592”]Cons of forcing SSL for IRC</h1>
<ul>
<li>Active people run into annoying issues (already had a couple post here)</li>
<li>People that want to try to use their own clients may not see this thread</li>
<li>Sometimes annoying to set up even for those that can get it to work[/quote]</li>
</ul>
<p>teething issues for people using their own clients, the webapp is 100% supported and can be used for everyone, and we’re here to help configure private clients</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:21, topic:553592”]&gt; privacy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>public channels<br>
already had option to connect via ssl if you cared about your irc “privacy” in non-public channels<br>
k[/quote]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as mentioned, ssl doesn’t work on channels with people without ssl, and if the person you’re talking to doesn’t use ssl then your connection is plain text, it’s easy to dismiss this as being obvious but it’s not obvious to someone who doesn’t know the technical details</p>
<p>[quote=“sini, post:23, topic:553592”]Why are you getting offended by this, its a valid point. I know I can solve getting on the network, I don’t have much reason to visit it though anymore. But its limiting to the newer members of the community (yes all 5 of them).</p>
<p>If it wasn’t broken before, then why change it? No lets just add this in because why not. Was it needed? No! But you know whatever.[/quote]</p>
<p>if the new members already have an irc client they’re probably acquainted with irc enough to enable ssl, google to enable ssl, or are already using irc because usually the people who have irc clients usually ask if a new community they’re joining has irc</p>
<p>not being broken is subjective, and in this case it’s largely subjective to people who don’t care or aren’t affected by issues that could affect other people</p>

Not at all. You clearly said it was MITB that wanted to do it, I still think it’s a stupid idea, that MITB is wrong, and that it should be reverted. His site though. My issue with you is completely different. Yeah, I don’t think you should be hosting the IRC. Yeah, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if you spy on private channels and conversations. But that’s nothing to do with SSL. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

You’ve got me, my eagerness to force TLS is to lure the mopar userbase into a false sense of security so I can collect important personal information which I can sell to advertisers to make money off the community muhahahahahahahhahaha. i actually use plaintext passwords for the account database so i can sift through them an giggle on a nightly basis heheheheeeee <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> :biggrin:[/quote]</p>
<p>drat, revert the change boys! the best security is none at all, that way you <em>KNOW</em> to use end to end encryption!</p>

        <p>Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t it true that if you use SSL on your end then even if you are in a non-ssl required channel, your connection is still encrypted? Meaning anyone connecting from an outside country or work or whatever need not worry that other people aren’t using SSL as long as they enable it on their end. So then what the worry would be about is someone snooping on someone elses connection. So what can someone get from that? Private chat messages, and then the public channel log with no way to link people to usernames. I’m fairly certain they wouldn’t have your IP address since you’re not P2P, and since it’s not listening on your connection there’s nothing that can be tied to you. Sure, private messages being snooped on could be annoying, but I still don’t believe that it outweighs even the fringe cases like sinisoul’s when there’s so many other human security flaws anyway. Just my opinion.</p>
<p>And while I know you were being facetious:<br>
"you’re literally the reason why websites in 2015 think it’s okay to not have https :^) "</p>
<p>Again there’s a difference between not having https:// and forcing it; sites that deal with sensitive information often enforce it, whereas there are others that allow both in the cases where you are having trouble verifying the certificate so you can use http without SSL if you wish. IIRC we’ve actually run into problems with this site with downtime because of SSL verification problems. It would be pretty silly to not have a SSL option though.</p>

        <p>ssl should be enforced everywhere imo. if there are problems with that then they should be <em>fixed</em> (e.g., your own shit client that you decided to use in the first place). i have no feelings attached to mopar irc (never used it, probably never will) but feel like it’s pure ignorance to argue against compulsory encryption when your only argument is “meh too hard get rid of it lads”.</p>
