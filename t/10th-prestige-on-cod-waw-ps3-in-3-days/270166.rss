    <title>10th prestige on Cod WAW (PS3) in 3 days</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/10th-prestige-on-cod-waw-ps3-in-3-days/270166</link>
    <description>Please tell me if hack/glitch is old. (I only heard about it recently and cannot find any vids) 
This only works on PS3 and you have to be connected via Ethernet.

When you are level 65 go to the prestige menu (Final screen) and sit next to the back of your PlayStation and have your hand near your ethernet cable. Then click (press X) and count to two (resonably fast) and pull out your ethernet cable. When the connection error comes switch off your PS3 from the front and reboot it with COD:WAW inside. You should now have prestiged but still level 65 so you can repeat this until you are 10 prestige.

Hope it works.</description>

<p>Well yeah, pretty much this. I’d like it a little more if guns were actually balanced, distance played a part in damage, and/or overall accuracy, at the minute firing from the hips at 20-30 ft is too random and I’ve died a ton of times this way because they get a headshot(aiming at my groin or whatever), lmgs were tweaked so you can’t spray them through walls and get random headshots, games synced properly etc etc.</p>
<p>I liked the music, and campaign in cod5 more, and not just because I know a film reference <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> , ALTHOUGH the campaign was ridiculously short, a mere 5 hours or so depending on how serious you played, and well, no thought went into balancing multiplayer. I don’t like COD4, because so many little things could have been done to actually make it worth the game of the year award, even just little things could have made it so much better, and I don’t think it deserves the game of the year award because at best, a few features were “good”. The plot was predictable, ending was terrible, and the gameplay is average, albiet tweaked for tards.</p>
<p>EDIT: and since Thug brang KZ2 up, if you’re not a COD fanboy it’s a pretty good game, but headshots are too easy due to the stiff feeling of controls(compared to the smooth controls in cod, even if they do occasionally force-auto aim into a wall because someone ran past).</p>
<p>EDIT2: and back on topic, has anyone tried this glitch yet?</p>

<p>Niall might disagree because he can’t get his head around the pacing of the game, but imo Killzone 2 &gt; CoD4 by a long shot.</p>

This only works on PS3 and you have to be connected via Ethernet.</p>
<p>When you are level 65 go to the prestige menu (Final screen) and sit next to the back of your PlayStation and have your hand near your ethernet cable. Then click (press X) and count to two (resonably fast) and pull out your ethernet cable. When the connection error comes switch off your PS3 from the front and reboot it with COD:WAW inside. You should now have prestiged but still level 65 so you can repeat this until you are 10 prestige.</p>
<p>Hope it works.</p>
