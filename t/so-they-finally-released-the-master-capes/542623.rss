    <title>So they finally released the master capes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-they-finally-released-the-master-capes/542623</link>
    <description>They&#39;re exactly what I thought they would be. They would look like the dungeoneering skillcape, but with the appropriate logo/colors.

</aside>
<p>Between wanderers and rs’s, his have the old skill logo’s, and the colors are a bit different.</p>
<p>Also: All 120 capes have the particle effect like the 120 dungeon cape. The color of the particles is the same color as the skill (So HP = red, etc)</p>

Yours look clean, there’s look HD. lol.<br>
