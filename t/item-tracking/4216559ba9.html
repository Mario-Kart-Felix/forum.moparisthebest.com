<p>First of all, it requires extensive work to change the codebase of all private servers I have seen to date (including my own previously released ones), in order to fully take advantage of what I am advocating. Be it IoC/DI, AOP, Domain Driven Design with their Repositories, Services, Entities (including Aggregates), Value Objects, Factories, Specifications and possibly also Domain Events.</p>
<p>But you should know that, I’m not saying this because it’s the best solution for everything. So you don’t have to do it my way if you don’t want to. I want everyone to make up their mind on their own. And I’m also open to other better solutions for things, as long as they’re taking into account decoupling, separation of concerns and good API design etc.</p>
<p>A Service is stateless and should be used if some operation in an Entity or Value Object is too complex and requires more than itself (well, usually). A simple operation requiring one (or maybe a few) Value Object(s) etc. might be OK to keep inside the Entity or Value Object itself.</p>
<p>But in this case, transactions usually requires that you send data to a database or other storage medium. Since you cannot conceptually add Infrastructure-related parts to the Domain Model, then you need to have a Service for this operation. A Service is usually an interface-type for which you supply an implementation for a specific area. You might have one implementation for an MySQL-database and one implementation for some file type. Now, if you inject via some IoC-container, all you need to do to change from the MySQL-database implementation to the implementation for the file type, is to change a reference (a text-string representing the fully qualified class name) in the XML-document used by the IoC-container - or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Following is an example of a Service:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">//Part of the Domain Model Layer.
public interface SellToShopService {
     void sellToShop(Player player, Item item, Shop shop);
}

//Part of the Infrastructure Layer, where some of the MySQL-implementations are located.
public final class MySQLSellToShopService implements SellToShopService {
     @Override
     public void sellToShop(Player player, Item item, Shop shop) {
          //Actual implementation omitted.
     }
}</code></pre>
<p>I also recommend you buy the book “Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software” by Eric Evans. And Martin Fowlers books are great aswell.</p>

And Martin Fowlers books are great aswell.[/quote]The idea behind the transaction was just to make a ‘trade’ between them (transact seemed like a better name than trade seeing there can be many types of transactions between entities).  If there was an error the entire transaction would fail and throw an error.  It had nothing to do with a database or anything like that.</p>
<p>Though, adding a clear concept of containers would make it so much easier to make transactions between them using a service.</p>
