it had to be said though<br>
[/quote]No it didn’t.</p>
<p>I had said nothing wrong, and whatever they started arguing with me over was purely opinionated.</p>
<p>The only contributions YOU have made to the thread were flame, and I was the first one to answer the question.<br>
[/quote]i believe that the last few pages have just been about how you <span class="bbcode-i">were</span> wrong, because there is an IE variation of CSS.</p>
<p>if you don’t know what you’re talking about, you shouldn’t be posting. if you say something invalid, it’s good that you’re corrected so we actually learn properly and don’t go around remembering peoples bullshit.<br>
[/quote]I know there are differences between the CSS used in IE and other browsers, and the only thing I said was that it’s not called ‘IE CSS’, and that they are the same language. People just assumed that meant that I thought there was no variation, and started arguing about it. Even when I told them that I knew that there were differences but still the same language we just started arguing about the name…<br>
[/quote]And you were completely wrong. Also you came off and said there’s no difference between IE CSS and Opera/Firefox/Chrome/Safari CSS which was wrong. You also implied that Opera, Firefox, Chroma, and Safari have the same CSS, which is wrong as well.[/quote]When did I say that there is no difference? I think that I said the opposite you clueles moron… And I also said that I know about the differences between browsers, and the <span class="bbcode-b">ONLY</span> thing I was arguing about was the label people slap onto it.</p>
<p>I can quote at least 4 posts in this topic that show your cluelessness and stupidity if you want me to.</p>

The reason why I asked about if it was clipped was because you ignored the parenthetical psychology (the context that it is meant for), not for the part following the comma.<br>
A thesaurus lists synonyms, the words aren’t the same.<br>
I understand slang usage of ‘retarded’ is applicable, but the point I meant was that by the definition I provided, it’s not. I don’t really think all of this is necessary - we seem to be agreeing with each other for the most part.</p>

I’m fairly certain that the Oxford English Dictionary is considered a reputable and accurate source for definitions. The one I provided was from the Compact Oxford English Dictionary. And yes, the context of the definition was that it was meant to be applied to people - that was my point. I am fairly certain that I did indeed comprehend the definition - I am not trying to flame, but you seem to be only furthering my point - the definition isn’t applicable to this context.<br>
Did you clip that definition?</p>
<blockquote>retarded [rɪˈtɑːdɪd]
adj
(Psychology) underdeveloped, esp mentally and esp having an IQ of 70 to 85</blockquote>
http://www.thefreedictionary.com/retarded
If not, where did you get that definition from? Are they considered a reputable source?
