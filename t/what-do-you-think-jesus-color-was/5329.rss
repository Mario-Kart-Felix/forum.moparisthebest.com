    <description>What do you think Jesus&#39; color was?

He was a Jew from the Middle East and he was born there cause someone raped Mary or something. I think it was the father Joe, but everyone seems to believe god did it!). 

Beats me, but somehow Mary got pregnant and gave birth to Jesus, who was Jewish and since both his parents were brown with curly, black hair. He&#39;s not going to pop up being white with brown, straight hair. If he did, no one in the Middle East would have listened to him because they had high tensions with the Romans who were mostly white with brown straight hair.

So what do you think? Was he white? Or is the Church in the Vatican brainwashing you once again so you are confortable with your God&#39;s image in your mind. 

Countries such as... Israel, Nigeria, and countries around there, also including India. They show Jesus for what he actually looked like. How did the Indians know what he looked like? Because that&#39;s where Jesus was during the.. &quot;Lost Years&quot;. If you ddin&#39;t know, the church covered that up by naming it that.

About 4 months ago, an ancient text was found under a church stating that Judas didn&#39;t want to betray Jesus, but Jesus actually told him to, so that he could die for our sins. That way in the eyes of god, everyone would be just fine and dandy and no one would go to hell.

About 3 months ago, Rapture Crapture was found out, and in the news it stated that the Antichrist was litterally a fake and was created in the 1920s-1930s by some crack pot who later got fired by the Vatican church. Then the Vatican church decided that it wasn&#39;t as fucked up as they thought it was and so they put it in all the bibles and etc etc etc. 

Well believe it or not, the victors right the history, so the normal belief now in Western (white) culture is that Jesus was an albino christian with brown straight hair who was emaculately conceived by a higher source, was raised in Israel and still white. Then when he was 15 he just left Israel cause he thought it would be a nice road trip and he was lost for 10 years. Then he came back suddenly with an idea for christianity, and was betrayed by Judas, so Jesus died on a cross to free us of our sins. (What a guy)

Who was Jesus really? He was a rebel man. He didn&#39;t say what the church says now. He partied, he had sex, he drank, he smoked weed, he gambled, he swore, he told people to go fuck themselves, and much more that we can&#39;t picture him doing. Can you picture Jesus Gay? Ohhh man that would get you spanked and hit by every nun with a ruler or 2 by 4. 

He was one mother fucking brown with black curly hair jewish rebel who got fucked by the romans, then after all that work of Christianity and love to everyone, the church took over his teachings, changing, and manipulating them. And guess what happened next.

We got a Nazi for our pope.

<p>I think he was just standard middle eastern appearance, from old testament prophesy, we assume he had a beard. Other than that we really have very little idea of his appearence…</p>
<p>But you raise a valid point… it is rather strange how we westernise Him everywhere… It’s certainly not biblical… and perhaps even stems from white supremist / racist influences… strange really.[/quote]<br>
Exactly. Every country represents their own god in a comfortable image. What’s a comfortable image for a mutant with 3 eyes, 4 mouths, and 1 eyebrow? Someone with 3 eyes, 4 mouths, and 1 eyebrow lol.</p>
<p>I mean look at budha. Budha looks oriental in Japan and China and the other oriental countries. But somehow Budha has round eyes and brown skin in other countries.</p>
