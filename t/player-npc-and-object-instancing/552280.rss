    <description>Hello. moparscape I would like to create an instance for players (not for player own houses) I have the instance for players but npcs and objects are still showing to all players. I have played around with both object and npc and could not get it to work.

The player object has a &#39;updateVisisblePlayer&#39; method. Does the npc and object have the same methods if not would someone please redirect me to a tut or supply me with the methods thanks.</description>

              <p>As Sk8 said, just use the playerId * 4 if you’re on the “0” you can scale that to work for other height levels as well, this will give you the “individual player zone” you want.</p>

              <p>Well my intentions were to create an instance for guild zones, I have implemented. But I will attempt your method of handling instances to see if it is what I’m looking for.</p>
<p>So I tried your method and works with npcs great!. Can you lead to me a tut on adding height support for objects thanks again (I will look for a tut to)</p>

              <p>There’s no need to create an “instance” for the player, honestly.<br>
The only time you <em>really</em> need it, is player owned houses.</p>
<p>Just move the player to height + 4. (4 * playerId for more instances)<br>
So if you were on height 0, the other valid heights would be: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, etc…<br>
height 1: 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, etc.<br>
And so on…</p>
