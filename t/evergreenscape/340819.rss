    <description>Hello All,
I am here to advertise a brand new server called EverGreenscape.

Server will be 40x exp rate and will only drop rares when we hit a certain number of people. We do not want to flood server with rares and will only drop to player/rare ratio. We will be hiring staff after a certain amount of time, we are not into just asking friends to do it and then have them abuse it, we want a good fair server that everyone can enjoy.
There will be alot more updates added in next few days but i will be releasing this now for you to enjoy. The exp rate will be dropped to 25x once everyone has settled. Here are a few screenshots and a list of what we have done so far.
Oh yes i nearly forgot we will be adding a new Event arena and sub island which you will be able to earn privilage to go on without paying a single penny. We still need to think of some ways of people earning. We also will be adding a pk island! Game download and website is in my sig!

-Blue Dragons at alter with a spear wall around them.
-Rock of ages with Blue Dragons.
-Shield Mender at back of Edgebank
-Mithrel seeds work
-Can put cannon together now
-Need certain amount of quest points for champions guild
-Admin can promote ingame
-Staff can teleport to towns like ::teleport edgeville
-command ::npctalk makes npctalks
-::wild command says if wild is inactive or active
-Nearly every skill has been editted so multplyer is correct
-Implemented magic pools
- added runecraft codes just need to add to skill menu will be done in next day or so
- added rats to the castle

<p>Can I get details on the server? So I can make a decision if I’m going to play it or not?</p>
<p>exp rate?<br>
pk based? or?<br>

<p>We will be adding in clan system and also we will be adding in new custom quests for other people. We are generally working on everything to try cater everyone. I do not see any reason for you to be rude. You guys can be locking this topic if you want because we have changed name of server and will be making a new topic.</p>
<p>Thank-You</p>
