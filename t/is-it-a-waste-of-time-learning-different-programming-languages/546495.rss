    <title>Is it a waste of time learning different programming languages?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-a-waste-of-time-learning-different-programming-languages/546495</link>
    <description> I was looking around online for jobs. I saw that Java developers wouldn&#39;t earn any less then a C++ programmer. Most jobs hardly require you to know multiple languages but maybe knowledge of SQL and other stuff instead. 

C is a pretty hard language compared to Java. Would it be best to just stick with Java and go into a career as a Java programmer, I didn&#39;t see any differences in pay really. 

Some people may want you to know Python or Ruby alongside Java (obvious reasons) so what do you guys think?</description>

You don’t need to know every method of every class in every API ever made. What you do need to know how to do is put it all together into one place with a smooth flow.

It’s not about memorising it when you have the docs to reference. It’s the approach you take to solves problems. It differs a lot.</p>

Look you barley even know Java. How long do you think it’ll take you to fully understand the language? Yeah transistioning to another language might be easier but it’s hella hard to do so.</p>
<p>Takes time. I have this idea that having 1 strong language would save a lot of time. I’ve been doing Java for around 4 years, I still suck. In a work environment you won’t be able to get people spoon feeding code when you get a problem. I’ve been learning pretty slow since I’ve started but from what I’ve heard it could take around 5 years to actually know a language (it’s just something I heard).</p>
<p>I know a few languages. I could write a couple of program’s sure. I still don’t know the language deep enough to not need google every 5 mins.</p>

imo it’d be a dumb move to just learn one language coz the industry changes too quickly and you can’t really predict which languages will come in useful. at least if you know a handful of languages you know you’re capable of learning others pretty easily.<br>
[/quote]<br>
This is true to some extent, though all I’ve ever really do is know a language at it’s basic form. I’ve never needed to code in something like VB or Pascal. I’ve never even found a proper use for learning LUA (even though some people still do). In fact I feel as if it was a waste of time because I don’t see myself or any job I go for using it.</p>

<p>c might be more difficult to use (than java???) but it is most definitely not more complex than c++… quite literally – c++ is a <em>superset</em> of c.</p>

</aside>
<p>No I wrote C++ by mistake. I’m talking about C ignore the fact I mentioned C++. The point I was making was even though C is more complex, a developers pay wouldn’t change. Just because the language may be harder to use doesn’t mean you’re going to earn more money.</p>

How much do you think the average salary for a C++ programmer is or yours? If it’s any more than £130,000,00 per year then I guess it’s worth going into otherwise just being a noob and doing Java (which is easier) would be so much better because you can get a decent pay from it.</p>

<p>imo it’d be a dumb move to just learn one language coz the industry changes too quickly and you can’t really predict which languages will come in useful. at least if you know a handful of languages you know you’re capable of learning others pretty easily.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is true to some extent, though all I’ve ever really do is know a language at it’s basic form. I’ve never needed to code in something like VB or Pascal. I’ve never even found a proper use for learning LUA (even though some people still do). In fact I feel as if it was a waste of time because I don’t see myself or any job I go for using it.</p>

<p>I was thinking about C but wrote C++ haha. C is pretty difficult if you’re not a good programmer. A big mistake could easily mess up your PC.</p>
<p>Pointers are kinda hard to use too if you’re a rookie. Java is much more safe and easy to pickup. Better syntax too and other cool stuff.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>wat</p>
<p>c might be more difficult to use (than java???) but it is most definitely not more complex than c++… quite literally – c++ is a <em>superset</em> of c.[/quote]<br>
No I wrote C++ by mistake. I’m talking about C ignore the fact I mentioned C++. The point I was making was even though C is more complex, a developers pay wouldn’t change. Just because the language may be harder to use doesn’t mean you’re going to earn more money.</p>

<p>Learning something like Basic would be a waste of time :rolleyes: - The whole idea of going deep into a language puts me off because I don’t know if I’ll actually be using it.</p>
