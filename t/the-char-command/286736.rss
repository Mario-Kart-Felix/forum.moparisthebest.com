    <title>The ::char command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-char-command/286736</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, I&#39;m having problems with ::char command.
I use PwnScape as a source and client, I set up the ::char, I will display the code at the end of this post, I used it the interface pops up with my character. But I can&#39;t change anything.
I click the arrows and nothing happens, but when I close it my character changes. So it isn&#39;t displaying the change and when I try to change the colour it disconnects and then reconnects.
What&#39;s up with this? and if anyone can fix this problem could you include a way to make the Make-over-mage have the ability to do this?
Thank you.

CODE FOR ::CHAR
}
 else if(command.startsWith(&quot;char&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;= 441) {
				showInterface(3559);
			}
else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;frame35&quot;))
{
outStream.createFrameVarSize(35);
outStream.writeByte(10);
outStream.writeByte(10);
outStream.writeByte(10);
outStream.writeByte(10);			
}

I don&#39;t even know what the heck the frame35 is but I got it from another source under the char command, I thought it would make it work Lol.</description>

              <p>Basically you can design your own character while doing this, but i really doubt you will:</p>
<p><code>}
if(command.startsWith("male")){
			pHead = 0 + misc.random(9);
			pBeard = 10 + misc.random(7);
			pTorso = 18 + misc.random(7);
			pArms = 26 + misc.random(6);
			pHands = 33 +misc.random(2);
			pLegs = 36 + misc.random(5);
			pFeet = 42 +misc.random(2);
			pHairC = misc.random(5);
			pTorsoC = misc.random(5);
			pLegsC = misc.random(5);
			pFeetC = misc.random(5);
			pSkinC = misc.random(5);
			playerLook[0] = 0 + misc.random(5);
			playerLook[1] = 0 + misc.random(5);
			playerLook[2] = 0 + misc.random(5);
			playerLook[3] = 0 + misc.random(5);
			playerLook[4] = 0 + misc.random(5);
			playerLook[5] = 0 + misc.random(5);
			apset = true;
			appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
			lookUpdate = true;
pGender = 0;
</code><br>
This makes your ::male randomly change what your character looks like. Like i said you can change say the pskin to = 1 and it will make your character darker.</p>
