Hello Moparians I am creating this thread to put together a team that knows or is willing to know how to use unity 3D, we will develop games for iPhone&#39;s/iPod&#39;s/iPad&#39;s and For PC Users.

Our main idea is to be able to develop shooters as they are popular in modern day society and may produce plenty of income for our team.


Our first project will be compatible for iPhone user&#39;s as it may be easier for income to be produced easier as many people with iDevices do tend to spend money, take doodle jump for instance it was a craze and was selling for $2 if a few thousand people bought this app for $2 imagine the income they have produced.


NOTE: If you are willing to join this team you will not get paid like a normal job. There may not be an income depending on how successful our sales go.


What we are after:

Modeller: Someone who can create models and be able to animate them.
An Idea provider: someone willing from the goodness of their heart to provide ideas, (receive discount on all products).

More will be mentioned throughout the developing of our products.</description>
