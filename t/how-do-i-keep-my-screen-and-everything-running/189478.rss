    <title>How do i keep my screen and everything running?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-keep-my-screen-and-everything-running/189478</link>
    <description>Yeah well, When I&#39;m sleeping after less than a hour my computer automatically shuts down. When it shuts down my autoer stops and I usually have only gained 1k of the ore I&#39;m mining. But when I tape one of my buttons on my keyboard to keep it on it usually works *I only tried this once because I was getting pissed*, Does anyone know a way i can get it to work without taping a piece of the keyboard... I only have 2 keyboards and I don&#39;t wanna ruin this one.

Anyways if theres a manual way to stop this, I need a bit of help, I run on Windows Vista,

Thanks,
-John</description>

<p>I’ll look, it should be there hopefully.</p>
<p>Also i left my computer on 3 hours Stand<br>
by and when I got back there was not one thing done from when I left. But when I got back on it started doing its Job.</p>
<p>Edit: I found it JME I’ll test it later. I set it instead of turning off the screen every 20minutes, and turning off the computer every hour to 1hour screeen and 3hours computer. xD</p>
