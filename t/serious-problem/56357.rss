    <description>[b]This is gone on long enough![/b]
[s][s]It&#39;s making me mad, and Yes, I HAVE everything downloaded![/s][/s]

Ok, I have been playing MoparScape for awhile now, I was first introduced by my friend bla bla. I started playing 00berscape then I became an admin on it. Now when I go to the webclient it says:&quot;Starting up&quot; Then the whole webclient just exits out all by itself.

So then I downloaded the downloadable version of it then [b]BAM[/b] It just happens again. I downloaded [b]EVERYTHING[/b] need to downloaded such as the newest version of java and JDK and did everything needed. It is continuing to happen, even with the downloaded version. [u]What&#39;s the dealio?[/u]

              <p>Maybe you have a firewall blocking it. My firewall ALWAYS asks me if I want to block it when I forget to type /smf on the end of the URL.</p>
<p>Maybe you accidentally hit block? :S</p>
