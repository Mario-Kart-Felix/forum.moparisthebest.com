              <p>It’s well known that James Brown had a… less than perfect… personal life.</p>
<p>However, musically he affected much more than most really imagine, across all genres. It’s a shame. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>Old news is so exciting.</p>
<p>But for you Ron, I’ll pretend it’s new. When I heard he died earlier today, I mumbled something about hammer time and gnarls barkley, but my true feelings are actually much shallower than that. I don’t know enough to comment on what a profound influence James Brown had on the musical community and the R&amp;B scene, so I’ll just assume he really didn’t do much.</p>
<p>So I leave you with this wacked out picture of James Brown, arresting after leaving his house high on PCP after busting down the door of a nearby convention for rich white people, where he demanded to know if any of them had used his toilet, and if so “Wuffo?” (This is a true story)</p>
