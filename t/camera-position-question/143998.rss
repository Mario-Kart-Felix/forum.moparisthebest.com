    <title>Camera Position Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/camera-position-question/143998</link>
    <description>Would there be any way to say, move the camera position once again? I remember a while back someone created a client that allowed for camera movement that worked with regular clients. I was thinking of an idea to move the camera position towards your characters head to allowed for a &quot;first person&quot; view of runescape. By &quot;would there any way&quot; I don&#39;t mean is it possible, I&#39;m wondering if it is able to be accomplished with the current client. I don&#39;t mean a rearrangeable camera, I mean a set position (on your character&#39;s head.)</description>

<p>Why do you think that?[/quote]</p>
<p>Let me rephrase that…</p>
<p>Today you can’t get an undetectable deob by publicly available, pre-programmed means.  In the past all you had to do was download waffendennis’s deob or double click my deob maker.  Certainly it is possible to make an undetectable deob, it is simply not as easy as it used to be.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why do you think that?</p>
<p>It’s fairly trivial to run a deob without any more detectability than any other modified client. It requires a couple changes to the code where the reflection checks are made as well as a deob name mapping but other than that, there are really no other real obstacles to running a deob with no more detection than any other modified client.</p>
<p>I downplayed the term <span class="bbcode-i">mapping</span>. To explain, the mapping must be able to successfully return visibility modifiers on any field/method of the original codebase as well as original field/method names.<br>
The simplest way that I can think of to accomplish this involves using zkm for renaming because it generates a flat-file change log. Parse the change log and you have a perfect mapping of the original -&gt; deob names/visibilities.</p>

              <p>There is no KNOWN way on how to do this, however, I’m sure it would be possible to do. Grab the latest deob, and start looking. If you find it, figure out a way to inject the code you use w/ BCEL. Remember, you only have around a week to find+inject+use until the client is updated and you have to start looking all over again. Unless of course you make an updater <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
