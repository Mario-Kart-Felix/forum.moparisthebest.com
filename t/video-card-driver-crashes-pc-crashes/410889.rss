    <title>Video Card Driver Crashes / PC Crashes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/video-card-driver-crashes-pc-crashes/410889</link>
    <description>Okay so I can&#39;t take it anymore. Here are the specs of the PC I built:

[code]CPU: AMD Phenom X4 955 Processor 3.2GHz (Not overclocked)
Motherboard: ASRock M3A785GXH/128M AM3 AMD 785G HDMI ATX AMD Motherboard
Video Card: Sapphire ATI Radeon HD 5770 1GB 128-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 2.1 x16
Memory: 4GB DDR3 1066
OS: Dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.4(don&#39;t use too much this mainly happens on Windows 7 but I haven&#39;t used Ubuntu enough to have it crash)[/code]
If you need to know anything else just tell me.

I can not for the life of me figure out what is wrong. When I play games that I should clearly be able to play (Minecraft), I crash. My video card driver crashes (which makes some games crash), I get a blue screen saying that it couldn&#39;t get the video card driver to start responding again, or my favorite of all, my computer crashes with no blue screen or anything and just restarts itself. Out of all the games I have installed (GTA SA, Sims 2, Minecraft, Oblivion, Terraria, Portal 2) I can only play Terraria and Portal 2 without crashes from my driver. Also the reason this really started pissing me off is because I was working on making a graph of a parabola in java and I was sitting there just [b]re-sizing the window[/b] and my pc crashed. I&#39;ve updated to the most recent version of my driver, I&#39;ve updated Windows, and I just don&#39;t know what else to do. Should I buy a new card?

Also it should be noted that the graphics card uses a PCI Express 2.1 slot and my mother board only has 2.0, however I have heard that 2.1 is backwards compatible with 2.0 so that shouldn&#39;t be a problem?

So, any ideas?</description>

<p>Sounds about right with that ATI card you have there. Your only choice is to buy a nvidia card as they have drivers that actually work.</p>

<p>This, use nvidia, you get a much better feeling knowing you’re using a graphics card that’s produced by <span class="bbcode-b">nVidia</span> when it crashes than whatever obscure community produced yours!</p>
