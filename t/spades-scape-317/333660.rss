By the look of the pictures you can tell it is from Delta, but I didn&#39;t download Delta-Scape and just code from there like a lot of people do. I took a source that had some upgrades to it.

When I got this server it had tons of nulls, glitches, and plain out.. stupid stuff in it.
You were not able to trade, fight, or drop items.

I first fixed the fighting/trading. That was the easiest part. The coder before me thought it&#39;d be a good idea to make staff member rights 2+ not have the option to trade or fight in the wilderness.

The server was a Paradise add on with Corp Beast. The server also used Bluurrs client along with having Donators.

Things I have done:

Removed ALL CUSTOMS:
Removing the customs has been one of the hardest things to do yet. There is so much crap coded into these servers it is un-real. I have completely cleaned the Item.cfg folder. It is exactly the way it should be. I cleaned the Shops. I cleaned the Npc drops. I am still working on removing all the special attacks for the wep. that were over-wrote with it.

Random event:
I have removed the random event in there and re-done it completely. With help from my friend runefreak10 he helped me make it so when you teleport to the random event, it gets your cords and when you are done with the random event you teleport back.

Slayer:
Slayer was coded in before, there was just that stupid island that had some of the task nps&#39;c there. Firstly, I hated that, it reminded me of the All-Star source. So I spread the Npc&#39;s around so you have to teleport or run around to find your task&#39;s Monster. I didn&#39;t really do much of that. Here is a picture of the help menu I made.

Wilderness:
With the Wilderness, I fixed the skull/Level. When you walked into the wilderness before and walked out the wilderness level and skull would stay there. Now they don&#39;t They go away.
I also added the good old interface that RuneScape used to have before they added the wilderness ditch. The warning that your coming up to the wilderness. If your following somebody you stop following them, if you are running it stops you from running into the wilderness.

Tutorial Island:
I coded in a full Tutorial Island, I have not finished it yet, I will get to it sometime soon, but it had all the features, you can&#39;t go past level 3 on tutorial island and you cannot teleport off. 

Droping Items:
With a BIG help from runefreak10 we were able to re-do the dropping system. Before when I first got this source, when you dropped an item it would just disapear. I messed with it for a couple hours and got it to where when you drop an item, it would appear but nothing would happen, you could see it, but you couldn&#39;t pick it up. runefreak10 helped me to make it so when you drop an item it would appear, you can pick it up, it would appear to other people after time it is there, and after some time it would vanish. Thank you Bill... SO MUCH!

No more Bluurrs:
Getting rid of his client was the best thing ever. His client is very un-reliable(Imo) I didn&#39;t like having it, and the client you see in the pictures was a client made by my friend runefreak10. So, this client has been the main client for the source. I got to say it is awesome. Major Kudo&#39;s to you, Bill!

Login Screen
I just added this today, got this idea, just tired of seeing the random login screens so I made my own. I haven&#39;t seen anything else like this.
[img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9159/newloginscreen.png[/img]

Npc Noclip
I added a Npc Noclip fix, it allows you to mage/range from behind object without being attacked, there is a slight bug I will be working on, but for the most part it works just fine.
[img]http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/8233/noclipfix.png[/img]

A few other things I have added.
Range Follow
Mage Follow
Basic Npc No-Clip fix
Removed Lunar
Removed Quests
Added Click On Commands - http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/9924/menuf.png
Added Kalphite Queen 
Added Chaos Elemental - These 2 were coded in, but they were not spawned and no teleport to them, I just added that.

I made my own Rogues Mini-Game
Working on my own Pixies Mini-Game
Added a few basic commands that were not in
::givemod,admin,owner
::lockxp,unlockxp
::gamble - Takes 50M and gives you a random prize.
::ancient and ::normal
Custom ::players
and ::highscores
Added ::vent (Makes npc&#39;s yell a message) 
Added ::object (spawns an object)
Added ::deleteobj (deletes object)
Added ::showbank/showinv - Working on the commands
Added ::kill

I just added last night, a fix to the npc&#39;s twitching. So they don&#39;t twitch when they stand still. I know after a while they do that sometimes.

I found that there was part of the mage training arena coded in, so I am going to go and finish that, and turn it into a mini-game of some sort. 

I have been working on the following no-clip fix.

I&#39;ll keep updating this post as I go along.

your error occurs because of the client. you must make the client load the skulls from the cache and then add them into the player.java both by declaring it as an int with a value of one, and also by reading a byte from the client.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>How would I do that?[/quote]</p>
<p>open your client.java (client sided)<br>
look for unpacking media<br>
rip the whole section of code from another client, or use your own.</p>
<p>save and compile,</p>
<p>open server<br>
under appendplayerappearance() in  player.java</p>
<p>add</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		playerProps.writeByte(headIconPk);</code></pre>
<p>under</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		playerProps.writeByte(headIcon);</code></pre>
<p>find</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int headIcon</code></pre>
<p>and copy that and paste it right below it, but rename it from headIcon to headIconPk</p>
<p>Congratz you have loaded skulls!</p>
<p>now open your client.java and search for headIcon, and if the case/void it is in deals with attacking a player, change it to headIconPk</p>
<p>This is all hypothetical, sorry, i can’t test it, have no rsps junk on this computer. running Linux atm.<br>
:rolleyes: around 60-80% sure this will work though</p>

<p>Well, I ripped the code and image from another client, got no errors, made sure I got all the code into the couple files, then when I went in-game I attacked the other player and the same icon came above the head.</p>

If you want to know the problem, it is that the skull is arrow/bolt. I have no idea how to fix it. I am not a client person, I’ve messed with it trying to fix it, but I have yet to be successful.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>i think the problem with that is the server, its trying to display the skull as a headicon, or load from the headicons_prayer.dat file in the cache, i think you have to set the headicon to hint or something.[/quote]</p>
<p>I tried doing that, I was not successful</p>
