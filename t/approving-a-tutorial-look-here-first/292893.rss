    <title>Approving a tutorial? Look here first!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/approving-a-tutorial-look-here-first/292893</link>
    <description>Alright, seeing as `Rich and I have just spent the past few hours going through the tutorials section to ensure proper procedure was being used.  The outcome, was that there was a lot of &quot;iffy&quot; topics, of which did not follow the code conventions, but were good tutorials overall.  Yes, we want the good tutorials to be accepted, however we don&#39;t want others learning bad coding habits.  So, from this day forward, you do not accept a topic unless:


[ul][li]It complies with all current rules and guidelines[/li]
[li]There is not already a topic regarding the subject[/li]
[li]It is not copy and paste[/li]
[li]It follows proper Java Code Conventions[/li]
[li]It does not put any user reading it at risk (for example, a portforwarding guide is posted telling a user how to use their modem to portforward without a router, which makes them prone to attacks and such[/li][/ul]


And of course, remember when denying topics to use this BBC format:
[code]Hi,
 
The topic you recently submitted to the tutorial section was declined because (it was/showed):

[ul][li]A copy and paste tutorial[/li]
[li]An unnecessary tutorial (an action that doesn&#39;t require a tutorial to produce)[/li]
[li]You were unable to prove that you understood what you were talking about[/li]
[li]A list of several simple tutorials[/li]
[li]Incompleteness[/li][/ul]

 
We thank you for your tutorial, however we would ask that you next time follow the rules when posting a tutorial so it may be accepted.
