    <description>
Is one of the most powerful things I think.

You can imagine anything. And with such clarity.

I drive down the highway and I imagine giant hammers and balls swinging into cars sending them crashing into things and I have never seen that happen but I can picture it with such detail that I can see their horrified faces and arms being torn and broken and glass that cuts into the cars around them.

I can imagine things that I have no idea what they would actually look like but it seems so real.

If there was any way to use our brains as computers or our imagination to record movies of what we&#39;re seeing or something, the possibilities would be endless.

Discuss: Imagination. Awesome things to imagine. Etc.

Right now, I am imagining Pokemon are real. And I have a pet Marill.</description>

<p>Well now look at your creature, I bet that even if it appears brand new it is just made of old ideas that you have seen and sensed before.

<p>As far as this whole brand new idea goes, the creature could be a collection of things from previous knowledge (what a lot of our sight is based on) but that doesn’t mean it’s not original or not stretching our imagination. We have words to describe almost everything. It’s hard to think of a creature with an aspect we don’t understand, ie a creature that has a 4th dimension or, well it’s hard to say considering we’re talking about ways to describe something that haven’t yet been thought of.</p>
<p>As far as still being imaginative, or even as another rebuttal, I can probably think of a creature no one has thought of before. It’d have an incredibly weird but useless body with a wacky shape. And maybe people as teeth. It still has teeth because we know what they are and it’s paired with a lot of life forms but it’s teeth are a separate living entity besides being joined to the creature.</p>

effectively yes; heat emotions basic sense and nature are all we can perceive really everything else is a blend of these, however a definition of genius that i find most insightful is this</p>
<blockquote>Genius: seeing what everyone else see's but drawing a different conclusion</blockquote>
so perhaps most humans are not able to create whereas a genius can create something entirely different to what ordinary people will

<p>This is only because we have terminology to express ideas that already exist. It’s not impossible to imagine something entirely new, it’s only impossible to discuss it intelligently because there are no words to describe it.</p>

All i remember about it was that as long as you can think of gold, and you can think of a mountain, you have the capability of thinking of a gold mountain. =\ That, and the fact that keeping a log of your dreams for a long period of time will give you good control over a majority of your dreams.</p>

<p>And you don’t even have to be super creative to imagine things.</p>
<p>Imagine your past, bring up memories, or imagine something simple like a street with people on it. Imagine the people and what they are wearing.</p>

<p>Well, when I was about 6 years old I was so impressed by skateboarding that when I was bored in the car, I could see myself out the window  skating along with the car speed, railing ontop of other cars, jumping around etc. It felt so real.</p>
