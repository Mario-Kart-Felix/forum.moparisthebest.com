This is not mine, I&#39;ll be directly quoting how to use this from the person I got it from.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, how this works, is when you start Minecraft, it looks for the version file. I&#39;ve included the version file from the new update, which means when Minecraft sees it, it looks like the game has updated, and doesn&#39;t bother to download and overwrite everything, while the game stays undated.

After downloading - look for your .minecraft folder in Application Data. Unpack the bin.rar file that you download, into your bin folder, there. You&#39;re successfully downgraded.

The server, using hey0&#39;s server wrapper, should have stayed downgraded, so that&#39;s not an issue, am I right?

EDIT: Well, for everyone having issues, it&#39;s because I forgot that I have a few mods you have to accommodate for. =p I forgot I had them all, because they&#39;re useful mods that don&#39;t have an immediate effect on the game (like optimizers, and lighting mods.)

For those of you who download this, follow the guide [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=55700]Here[/url].

I use Better Light, and Better Grass (Don&#39;t worry about the mini-map, I don&#39;t like it. =p) You obviously don&#39;t have to follow the guide for putting files IN the jar, because that&#39;s already done.


Sorry for the inconvenience, but at least you can play. =p&lt;/blockquote&gt;

tl;dr -
Bin folder has 1.1 files with a 1.2 version file so your files won&#39;t update and you can play 1.1 servers until 1.2 gets Bukkit plugins. You will also have to either follow the guide in his post to install a mod which gives better lighting/grass and a mini-map or follow the instructions to uninstall it.</description>
