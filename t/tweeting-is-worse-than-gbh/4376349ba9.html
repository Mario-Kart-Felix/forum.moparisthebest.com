As long as it is constructive criticism I would support it. If you on purpose try to deceive someone, then the government should be allowed censor such speech. How you censor it is another case. With small offences a warning and removal/correction is sufficient, and for media they could risk losing some governmental support with repeated offences (If you have that in US/UK). And for some instances a fine/community service would be necessary.</p>
<p>Prison for this case is ridiculous, if you were to give him a form of sentence and not a fine, I would give him a couple of hours community service. I would only give prison of you profit greatly from misuse of your speech or the consequences by your actions are bad enough. For instance, tricking people to buy bad investments products -&gt; Prison. Causing suicide when you should know better -&gt; Prison.</p>

<p>No. But it isn’t, so whats the problem?</p>
<p>I find that a silly argument. It’s like saying “murdering humans is illegal, but what if I want to kill a deer to eat? WHAT ABOUT THEN?!?!”</p>
<p>Well, you kill the deer to eat. Because a deer isn’t a human. Much like a member of a traditionally stepped upon sector of society is very different to a corporation or government that should be held accountable.</p>

        <p>I should point out again that I do think the sentence was harsh. I agree with Bowser that some sort of community service would be a better idea for things like this, especially if it was relevant to the case, so for example make this guy work with some sort of organisation in his area that deals with race related issues. For the people who just wanted to be assholes, this is enough of a punishment to deter them, and for the people who genuinely have shitty views, perhaps that would give them the opportunity to see the other side.</p>
<p>But changing the law to suit some kind of weird ideal where we all get to say whatever we want as if words have no impact on society seems bad, to me.</p>

        <p>I agree with Mopman. The punishment was too harsh, and as I said, it seems to be a response to a recently discussed topic in this country, online harassment and bullying, about how people shouldn’t be able to get away with harassing and bullying people online because of the effects it has had on people, with kids killing themselves being the driving force behind this whole movement.</p>
<p>I don’t think people should be able to get away with harassing people online, and they should be punished for it. But there needs to be clear guidelines out in the open about where that line is and at what point is it crossed.</p>
<p>There is a reason why, in this country, you won’t see many people complaining about the fact this guy was punished for what he said, more so complaining about how harsh his punishment was. Like Mopman said, we don’t, generally as a population - subscribe to the same ideals you guys do. Freedom of speech should have logical limits, but should be protected where it is constructive and serves a purpose, such as criticism of government, corporations, public services, things that effect us as individuals and as a society. We have something called a democracy over here, you know, where you elect people to make the changes in government for you.</p>
<p>We actually understand how it works and don’t think ours is out to get us all the time, like <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> of you paranoid Americans are, and especially one or two of you who claim so adamantly that you have the best democracy in the world, yet have so little faith in it.  It’s the same on the issue of guns, giving them to regular people is not an idea that many even think about in this country, it’s never discussed because it isn’t something we think we need, thanks to the example of the US ;).</p>
<p>Mindless hatred and insults aren’t constructive and serve only as disruption. Protecting that is illogical and stupid.</p>

<p>[quote=“Greeny, post:32, topic:437634”]Can’t believe you haven’t heard of “wog”, its those dolls they used to sell if you collect tokens on jam jars lol.</p>
<p>They were called Golliwoggs, and were deemed racist sometime when I was a kid. I actually still have one somewhere.</p>

<p>I’ve known of golliwogs dolls and blackface for years, what I was saying is I’ve never heard the term “wog” used before, I always figured it was an insult to Chinese/Asian people</p>

<p>Laws never mean something is OK.  I think laws against ‘racist remarks’ are contrary to the concept of free speech.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think there’s a bit of a misunderstanding here</p>
<p>the laws aren’t against people being racist, if you hold racist views it isn’t against the law (see: bnp and nick griffin), the specific laws I quoted earlier are to prevent racist behaviour directed at individuals, a group of individuals or to incite violence etc, some examples would be going up to a black person in the street and shouting racial slurs against them, shouting racial slurs against a group of people, a crowd of people chanting racial slurs to incite violence/a riot etc etc</p>
<p>as mopman pointed out, stacey wasn’t simply making a broad racist term, he was directing racial slurs against people who replied to him</p>
<p>think of this way, in an ideal situation(that’s another topic), if I were American and I went up to a black person in an American street and started shouting racial slurs at him, the black person would be well within his right to deem my actions as threatening, and should the laws permit he could say, pull a gun on me to prevent any violence, the only difference here is the tweets were made online and not in person</p>
<p>EEEEEEDIT: and finally I do want to make clear again, I think the sentence was waaaaay too harsh, and if it wasn’t for the media/internet blowing this out of proportion he’d have gotten away with community service most likely, but I don’t think anyone ever claimed the media doesn’t blow stuff out of proportion</p>

        <p>I guess my problem with laws against ‘racist’ or ‘hate’ speech is that you have to trust your government and the people who make it up 100% to make the right decision every time as to what constitutes illegal speech.  The danger there is making speech that doesn’t agree with political agendas illegal.  Like a long time ago when saying ‘i hate the king’ would have gotten you killed.  If it wasn’t for certain speech like that, everyone would still be living under a monarchy.  Come to think of it, this may be why british people don’t mind these restrictions on speech, since they don’t mind living with a monarchy. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  (the last sentence only was a joke :))</p>
<p>So, to guard against ideas being squashed via banning some forms of speech, I’d rather people be able to say things others feel are offensive.</p>

        <p>We all vote for those who form the government, so don’t you think that laws like these are a reflection of the morale of a nation? At least in most European countries, the governments and parliaments are a great representation of the public. Most citizens feel related to the party they vote for, because they adhere to ideologies such as Social Democracy, Liberalism, Socialism etc. These political ideologies come with a sense of what is tolerable and what is not. This results in laws, for instance concerning freedom of speech and some exceptions to that freedom.</p>

<p>How much can we trust that the big parties are following their ideologies. The Norwegian Labour Party (Biggest party and in power right now) have gone against the rest of the left-wing parties and the biggest Labour union in a case about labour politics. They are too weak-minded to go against EU’s directives, and leaves their ideology.</p>
<p>So I do not believe that laws do necessarily reflects the population.</p>
