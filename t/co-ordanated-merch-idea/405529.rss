    <title>Co-ordanated merch idea?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/co-ordanated-merch-idea/405529</link>
    <description>Okay.. personally I hate merchers but I have an idea for a good merch profit. Please don&#39;t steal my idea and claim it as your own but feel free to use it..

I used to do this ages ago and I know it didn&#39;t make much of an impact but it did make a profit (did on 3 accounts at one time).

Possible things you can merch in this idea.
Nature runes are a staple rune, constantly needed for alching mainly.
Pure essence is used for the production of most runes in the economy, this is commonly botted by people who are too lazy to do better bots so there is a lot of it in the economy(this should be bought with ALOT of people for even higher success as people who bot Rc buy in big big bulk).
Law runes, a very important rune used for teleporting.
Death runes used in Combat magic spells.
An alching object(no garentee&#39;s of a good turnover and it works slightly differently will be explained).

There is a max buy limit of each, 25k per 4 hours for most of the objects mentioned.
10+ Players buying these at the same time will cause 250k+ at one time of each of these being taken out of the G.E which is quite a lot enough to make an impact. We would give it an hour to let people sweat and start going OMFG0RZ I WANT RUNEZ0RZ FOR MAGE. Before selling it back.

For the alching item this is[b] how it works[/b], after Pure ess is bought (this doesn&#39;t stop many botters much but it does make an impact) and nature runes are bought there is FAR less Nature runes in the G.e. therefore a lot of wannabe mage pro&#39;s go fuck this and sell it for a loss. You can buy them at a cheaper rate and then when everything dumped in people will want to buy something to alch and you&#39;ll be there to happily supply them with the alching object for a higher fee (not too high obviously or they&#39;ll buy something else).

This is not an amazing guide or concept, its pretty simple. Remove a high % of the supply and let the demand rise then dump a lot of it back in. Don&#39;t panic if all of your items don&#39;t sell for the price you were expecting for just keep hold of them. The prices will stabalise as long as not too many people do this then you can resell it at a later date.

Priority of buying :
Nature Runes
Pure essance
Death runes
Law runes
Blood Runes
Alching item
Whatever else..

This is not a guide for mill&#39;s an hour unless you expand what you merch and who you merch with. For example the alch item buying is better of buying on your own but getting your friends to buy from g.e if your max limited.. but the runes is better for more people assuming you don&#39;t buy the whole G.E out.
I&#39;d make about 200/300k just from doing this averaged out per hour per account if your not a choob about it. So meanwhile you can do your normal money making method and have a nice profit per hour ratio.

Feel free to sell small quantities [1k of each item] every hour till the mass dump but it&#39;d work better if everyone noted when everyone was selling those 1k&#39;s. If someone were to purposely be greedy it will affect the profit % ruining it for everyone including the greedy person.

If you would like to do this feel free to do it, if you want me set-up times, more up to date better items drop your RS ign and your budget in the comments and i&#39;ll sort something out.
Common sense is obviously required(along with money).</description>

              <p>[quote=“IlikeArrays, post:10, topic:405529”]You guys need to understand “filtering” items… the real money. If you merch a item with a clan and the item is 1k and the dump price is 1.5k. Two things happen… either right before the dump price the item falls because everyone bails on it, or it works and everyone sells at 1500 and eventually the price of the item will go down even further then where it was initially (1k). It is simple inflation that you have to control.</p>
<p>Filtering is a continuous merch you can never give up on. You pick a item and choose a base price. So lets choose the base price for x item is 1k and the max price you choose would be 1100. You and your members buy the item at 1k and you aim to have the price of item to never go lower than that and you want to buy as much of the item at 1k and you hold it, don’t flip it. Just hold it and continue to take in x item and keep buying at 1k. No higher, no lower. If your working with a clan/team it is absolutely crucial that you trust one another or it won’t work. You choose the first sell price of 1005. Continue to buy at 1k and slowly sell at 1005, then once the base price reaches 1005 you choose the second sell price and continue on filtering the item and as you reach the end you slowly want to pull away (without dumping) and let the price slowly fall back to your initial base price.</p>
<p>Why not buy at 1k and sell at 1.1k? Well lets see… 100k profit…</p>
<p>Filter an item and you can earn…<br>
item limit every 4 hours x difference between base and sell price x amount of times filtered. + Everyone makes money.[/quote]<br>
You pretty much summarized what I mean.<br>
I’m not wanting to ruin people’s times but I would like to aid people with a lessor knowledge of runescape economics (yes it sounds nerdy but its true). I hardly play Rs and if it means that much to the Mopar community I wont do it myself.<br>
I don’t directly hate merchers, I hate there lack of care to the economy.</p>

<p>Yes but its continuous with continuous profit. Instead of merching one item for x amount of money, your doing it over and over again… some items merch faster than others.</p>

This is manipulating, which has always been done, and is the dirtiest and overall most frowned upon method of “merchanting.” Yeah, you’re altering the supply, impacting the demand. Tons of rich people do this with armor and such. Ever hear of Chassy13?<br>

<p>So yeah, thanks for the insight. This actually made me understand how it works a bit more. I’ll never use a team to merch though.</p>

              <p>That would be too many for one time. There would simply be not enough runes in the G.E at a reasonable price for sale. People will not be buying Nature runes or Death Runes at 500gp Etc…<br>
I’d say 10-25 people with 10 mill each is the optimum.<br>
I’m not so much for doing this personally, but this should hopefully make alching items come down in price (not all alching items will be merched and they will be attempted to be sold and wont be bought making the price fall and there is a relationship between nature rune prices and alching item prices so nature runes should logically rise again also this MAY make less people bot Woodcutting as the use of logs will be affected).</p>
<p>This method has been thought out, it CAN be problematic for certain skills that rely on alchers but there mostly botted so it could help…(not sure in all honesty it’d be a risk).<br>
If anything you’d almost be helping the economy.</p>
<p>I’m only doing this to help to be honest. I don’t mind if i’m not incharge.</p>

              <p>Okay… personally I hate merchers but I have an idea for a good merch profit. Please don’t steal my idea and claim it as your own but feel free to use it…</p>
<p>I used to do this ages ago and I know it didn’t make much of an impact but it did make a profit (did on 3 accounts at one time).</p>
<p>Possible things you can merch in this idea.<br>
Nature runes are a staple rune, constantly needed for alching mainly.<br>
Pure essence is used for the production of most runes in the economy, this is commonly botted by people who are too lazy to do better bots so there is a lot of it in the economy(this should be bought with ALOT of people for even higher success as people who bot Rc buy in big big bulk).<br>
Law runes, a very important rune used for teleporting.<br>
Death runes used in Combat magic spells.<br>
An alching object(no garentee’s of a good turnover and it works slightly differently will be explained).</p>
<p>There is a max buy limit of each, 25k per 4 hours for most of the objects mentioned.<br>
10+ Players buying these at the same time will cause 250k+ at one time of each of these being taken out of the G.E which is quite a lot enough to make an impact. We would give it an hour to let people sweat and start going OMFG0RZ I WANT RUNEZ0RZ FOR MAGE. Before selling it back.</p>
<p>For the alching item this is<span class="bbcode-b"> how it works</span>, after Pure ess is bought (this doesn’t stop many botters much but it does make an impact) and nature runes are bought there is FAR less Nature runes in the G.e. therefore a lot of wannabe mage pro’s go fuck this and sell it for a loss. You can buy them at a cheaper rate and then when everything dumped in people will want to buy something to alch and you’ll be there to happily supply them with the alching object for a higher fee (not too high obviously or they’ll buy something else).</p>
<p>This is not an amazing guide or concept, its pretty simple. Remove a high % of the supply and let the demand rise then dump a lot of it back in. Don’t panic if all of your items don’t sell for the price you were expecting for just keep hold of them. The prices will stabalise as long as not too many people do this then you can resell it at a later date.</p>
<p>Priority of buying :<br>
Nature Runes<br>
Pure essance<br>
Death runes<br>
Law runes<br>
Blood Runes<br>
Alching item<br>
Whatever else…</p>
<p>This is not a guide for mill’s an hour unless you expand what you merch and who you merch with. For example the alch item buying is better of buying on your own but getting your friends to buy from g.e if your max limited… but the runes is better for more people assuming you don’t buy the whole G.E out.<br>
I’d make about 200/300k just from doing this averaged out per hour per account if your not a choob about it. So meanwhile you can do your normal money making method and have a nice profit per hour ratio.</p>
<p>Feel free to sell small quantities [1k of each item] every hour till the mass dump but it’d work better if everyone noted when everyone was selling those 1k’s. If someone were to purposely be greedy it will affect the profit % ruining it for everyone including the greedy person.</p>
<p>If you would like to do this feel free to do it, if you want me set-up times, more up to date better items drop your RS ign and your budget in the comments and i’ll sort something out.<br>
Common sense is obviously required(along with money).</p>
