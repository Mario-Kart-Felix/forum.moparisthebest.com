    <description>i have followed several guides and i have been able to add the model and the ints to the class8.

i then was able to go on and type add models and it worked.

im able to see the weapon in the inventory and when i drop it on the ground but when i equip it it shows up as a scroll under my feet

it is in the weapon slot so im not sure why its not working
