    <title>How to make a ranged weapon?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-ranged-weapon/332857</link>
    <description>Ok I&#39;ve finished adding the emotes for the cannon and the stats and everything ... the only problem is now I need to make it into a ranged weapon instead of a melee weapon ...

Does anyone know how to make a hand cannon into a ranged weapon that requires cannonballs for ammo?
thx</description>
