    <title>Really need help with setting up shops &gt;.&lt;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/really-need-help-with-setting-up-shops/342302</link>
    <description>on the server im editing, trading/buying with npc&#39;s doesn&#39;t work, how would i go about setting it up?
EDIT: im editing AtomicScape 562, currently to buy items you have to do command ::buy and click a button to get the set of items that you want, this uses points that you get from pking.

how would i go about setting up shops that use Gp. currently with shopkeepers, if you try and trade with them nothing happens, could someone please help me to set up basic shops, in the past iv only really worked on 317 sources and iv never set up shops before, any help would be awesome.


also, characters are like permanently no-clipped and walk through anything &gt;.&lt; any idea how i could fix that? &gt;.&lt;

any advice or if someone could go through setting this up with me would be great, thanks</description>
