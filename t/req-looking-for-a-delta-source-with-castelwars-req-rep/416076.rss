              <p>Add it youself? it really isnt that hard. <span class="bbcode-s">Just make a new class</span> Oh this is delta isnt it, well it would prolly be handled in client.java, make an INNER class, add a simple method starting and ending the game (erm, system.MISC.timer or something is the timer method, look it up) then making it start, do a check for amount of players, have the people be given items (EG, make sure they are wearing this in slot to play) Etc. Shouldnt take more than maybe 2 hours</p>
