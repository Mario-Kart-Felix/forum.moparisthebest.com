    <title>Hybridscape Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hybridscape-help/46940</link>
    <description>Hi =-) I&#39;ve been toying with different sources, and it seems hybridscape is the most stable. However I only tested hybridscape on the mopar client, I then downloaded the hybridscape beta revision 16. However, whenever someone tries to connect, they get auto-kicked and from then on it says they&#39;re already logged in.

Whenever I tried to log on, the same thing happened. I then created a char file for myself, and I get the error:

&quot;Invalid loginserver requested. Please try using a different world&quot;


Could anyone please help me out a bit with this? Any help would be mucho appreciated ^+^</description>
