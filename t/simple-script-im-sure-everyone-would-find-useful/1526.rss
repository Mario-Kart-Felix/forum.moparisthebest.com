    <title>Simple script im sure everyone would find useful</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-script-im-sure-everyone-would-find-useful/1526</link>
    <description>ok could someone please make a script that starts in varrok (where rune mysteries finishes) then goes to - forgot the place but its a town south west of port sarim and it has a building with a respawning bronze pick-
then to pick up the respawning pick and moving back and forth every minute to avoid logging off (or autologin would be nice) and once the amount of picks have been taken (make it so we can put the amount in the variable), then to walk back up to varrok :)
if someone made this it would be greatly appreciated, i need it because the pickaxe handler doesnt always work so i have 2 or 3 picks per miner when i leave it overnight</description>

<p>But to allow it to work you have to have your pickaxe <span class="bbcode-b">in your inventory</span> - not equipped</p>
