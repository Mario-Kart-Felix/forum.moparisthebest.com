    <description>[B][I]Intro:[/I][/B]
BountyScapePkz was a very popular server about 6 months ago. It had almost 500 players at one point and it was running on a Delta base (Explains the fall of the server itself :D). I went on vacation and i had restricted internet access and the server just died. So when i came back i started Misthalin and left BountyScapePkz i cbf to start it again, just too lazy. Therefore i am in need of one or two people to help me rebuild this, or they can rebuild it themselves and be owner.

[B]Requirements:[/B]

[ul][*]Have worked for a server with 100+ players before
[*]Have good experience
[*]Able to dedicate a lot of time into this
[*]Be a leader
[*]Java programming skills
[*]Creativity
[*]Good communication skills
[*]Interest and dedication to private servers
[*]Understanding how RSPS technology works[/ul]


[B][I]Tasks[/I][/B]

[*]Writing high quality code to run new game content and update existing content

[B]Features:[/B]

[ul][*]Access to your very own dedicated server (Powerful too)
[*]Have your own webhost
[*]View and recieve donations[/ul]
