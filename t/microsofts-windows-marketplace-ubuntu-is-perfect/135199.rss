    <title>Microsoft&#39;s Windows Marketplace: &quot;Ubuntu is perfect!&quot;</title>

This is too funny not to show you. Microsoft has a site for downloads of various software products, not just their own. It&#39;s called Windows Marketplace. Yesterday, for a brief shining moment, you and 10,000 or so other people could and did download Ubuntu Linux from a link on that page -- thank you, Google Cache -- which sent viewers to CNET for the download.

According to that page, Ubuntu is perfect:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Note: This is the desktop version of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is a community developed operating system that is perfect for laptops, desktops, and servers. Whether you use it at home, at school or at work Ubuntu contains all the applications you&#39;ll ever need, from word processing and e-mail applications, to Web server software and programming tools. Ubuntu is and always will be free of charge. You do not pay any licensing fees. You can download, use and share Ubuntu with your friends, family, school or business for absolutely nothing.Version 7.04, named &quot;Feisty Fawn,&quot; adds the Ubuntu Studio, a multimedia editing and production suite, to the distribution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heaven only knows that&#39;s true, simply perfect for laptops, desktops and servers. The part Microsoft got wrong is it says the license is &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;No limitations&quot;. Actually, the GPL does set some limitations, like what you are responsible to do if you redistribute.

So you know I&#39;m not making it up and because Microsoft already removed the page and I know that even in Google cache it isn&#39;t long for this world:

              <p>Nice find lol. Yeah not everyone who works for Microsoft likes to use Microsoft products. My dad’s friend who worked at Microsoft was using Unix at home in 1998 (or '96). He said he hated how Microsoft doesn’t run on a command line anymore and how the command line runs over the Operating System which gives the user less control. I think that was when Win 95 or 98 came. I forget.</p>
<p>Anyway… nice find. Just goes to show that not everyone, even Microsoft employees, like the Microsoft operating system.</p>

              <p>Just think its worth mentioning that Windows Marketplace is for Windows software. It’s fair enough they removed it, since it shouldn’t have been on the site to begin with.</p>
