    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/will-this-work/96356</link>
    <description>  Ok, most people know me for my clients. But i hate servers and i have ben trying to get one done for a while now, will this be an easyer way for npc&#39;s to drop items? Tell me were to add it and if theres a couple things left out.

[code]

  If(NPC(&quot;9&quot;)isDead == true)
      spawnItem(&quot;4633, 1&quot;);
}

[/code]
