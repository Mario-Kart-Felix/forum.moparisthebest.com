<p>^^^ Lol.<br>
And what about these “school shootings” none where I live :S[br][size=1]Posted at: October 21, 2006, 12:27:57 AM[/size][hr]</p><blockquote>TOLEDO – Another high school shooting. Another child dead. People around the nation are asking: How safe are our schools?
<p>And Toledo’s no different.</p>
<p>News 11 looked into this question today, finding that most schools in our area have been taking part in a program over the last year with the help of a $500,000 federal grant.</p>
<p>Security has been much tighter at all of the local schools since the Columbine tragedy back in 1999. But with this program, there’s been a lot more training.</p>
<p>“We actually go into the schools and do what’s called ‘security and vulnerability assessment,’” said Mark Weinerskirch, a security expert at Risk Solutions. “We learn where their weaknesses are at, we learn where their strengths are at and we give them ways to improve and tighten up the security in their schools.”</p>
<p>“You know, there haven’t been that many shootings in schools,” Weimerskirch said. “From 1970, when we started really recording them, to 2005 there were 37. Now that’s not a lot. That shows that schools are a very safe haven for students and teachers, faculty and staff.”</p>
<p>Weimerskirch says hostage situations are rare. But in the post-Columbine world, schools are much more aggressive about security.</p>
<p>In many of the suburban school districts in our area, a $500,000 federal grant has helped develop comprehensive security plans and provide training. The training is for everyone, including teachers, superintendents, administrators, custodians, cafeteria workers and bus drivers, Weimerskirch said.</p>
<p>Springfield Local Schools bars students from carrying backpacks between classes and requires them to wear identification badges and restricts some clothing.</p>
<p>“One of the things we do not allow is hooded sweatshirts. Pocketed hooded sweatshirts are not permitted,” said Kathryn Hott, Springfield assistant superintendent. “Hooded jackets may be worn into the building but must be put into a locker and they’re not able to be put back on until students exit the building.”</p>

<blockquote>Teen facing adult, gang charges in Las Vegas school bus shooting
<p>ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - A teenager accused of shooting at a school bus full of classmates last month will be tried as an adult and will face prison if gang involvement is proved, a prosecutor said.</p>
<p>A court hearing was postponed Thursday for Teren Evans, 17, while charges were upgraded to attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm into a vehicle, plus allegations of gang involvement.</p>
<p>Chief Deputy District Attorney Victoria Villegas said the gang enhancement eliminates probation as a possible sentence, doubles the punishment and ensures Evans will go to prison if convicted. Each of three attempted murder charges carries a maximum possible sentence of 40 years in prison.</p>
<p>No one was wounded in the Sept. 21 shooting. Three bullets hit the back of the bus containing 28 students from Canyon Springs High School and a driver.</p>
<p>Clark County School District police said Evans opened fire after he and another teen got off the bus in the West Las Vegas neighborhood. Police said the shooting resulted form a gang rivalry. No charges were filed against the other teen.</p>
<p>Evans remained jailed Friday on $500,000 bail pending a Dec. 12 preliminary hearing in Las Vegas Justice Court.</p>

<blockquote>A student is believed responsible for firing shots near C.K. McClatchy High School and California Middle School Thursday morning, causing lockdowns at both schools and an intensive manhunt.
<p>The arrest of the 15-year-old sophomore ended a tense morning for parents and students at the schools.</p>
<p>Police say the incident was sparked by an argument the teen had with his girlfriend before school.</p>
<p>A school janitor saw the boy and his girlfriend arguing at about 7:30 a.m. in front of McClatchy, according to Officer Michelle Lazark with the Sacramento Police Department. The girl went to school, but Lazark said the boy “went home to get a weapon.” At about 8:20 the boy then went to the parking lot on the side of the Round Table Pizza two blocks north of McClatchy. While he was showing the handgun to friends, it accidently went off, Lazark said. Nobody was hurt.</p>
<p>Police alerted the schools which immediately locked down their campuses so nobody could go in or out. Within minutes dozens of parents, who’d received text messages from their children, began showing up at the high school.</p>
<p>Hilary Egan, whose daughter is a sophomore at McClatchy High School, was on her way to work when she received her first text message. Through tears she described receiving that first message from her daughter. “She text messaged me that the intruder alarm was going off at her school and they were putting the school in lock down. I asked if it was a test and she said no. I didn’t hear from her for 10 minutes, and when I got to the school there were police cars all around.” Egan said she was “petrified”.</p>
<p>Police quickly found what they belive was the gun used, a .45 caliber handgun, in some bushes at the pizza parlor parking lot. Using dogs and a helicopter, police began an intensive search of the neighborhood surrounding McClatchy High and California Middle School. They also searched the McClatchy campus to make sure the teen, who police said has a “history of behavioral problems,” was not hiding there.</p>
<p>At about 10:30 a.m. the boy was arrested at the light rail station at 19th and Broadway and the lockdown was lifted.</p>
<p>Parents were then allowed to sign releases and take their children home for the day if they wished. Dozens chose to do so. Several students said the teen was apparently jealous and was angry because his girlfriend was talking to another boy.</p>
<p>“Argument turned bad. Got us locked down for no reason,” said Tino Gonzales, another sophomore. “(He) needs help, man.”</p>
<p>“You never know what’s going on in the mind of a teenager,” said Lazark. “I think he was despondent over the initial argument he did have with his girlfriend.”</p>
<p>Lazark said he’ll be booked into Sacramento’s juvenile hall with at least a charge of reckless discharge of a firearm in public. Police are still investigating who owns the semi-automatic handgun which they believe the boy retreived from his family’s house. If the weapon was loaded, unlocked and available to the minor, the gun’s owner could face charges.</p>
<p>“Just the tragedy that our kids are sitting in chemistry class trying to learn and have to be put through this is sad enough, but to think that they’re at risk for physical violence at school is heartbreaking,” said Egan.</p>
</blockquote>[br][size=1]Posted at: October 21, 2006, 12:38:10 AM[/size][hr]<blockquote>NICKEL MINES, PENNSYLVANIA (AP) - A fourth and fifth victims died of their wounds Tuesday from the shootings at an Amish schoolhouse in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  A hospital spokeswoman says the seven-year-old girl died about 4:30 this morning at Penn State Children’s Hospital in Hershey.  The other died at Chrisiana Hospital in Delaware.
<p>Penn State Children’s Hospital spokeswoman Amy Buehler Stranges says the girl’s parents were with her when she was taken off life support. The girl died shortly after.</p>
<p>A six-year-old girl remains in critical condition and a 13-year-old girl is in serious condition at Penn State Children’s. Their names are not being released.</p>
<p>Three girls, ages eight, ten and 12, were flown to The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where a spokeswoman says they underwent surgery but remain in critical condition today.</p>
<p>Charles Carl Roberts IV, apparently spurred by a grudge two decades old, wrote his wife what authorities described as suicide notes, took guns and ammunition and went to a nearby one-room schoolhouse, where he killed several girls, critically injured six more, and took his own life, authorities said.</p>
<p>Roberts, a 32-year-old from nearby Bart Township who was not Amish, did not appear to be targeting the Amish and apparently chose the school because he was bent on killing young girls as a way of “acting out in revenge for something that happened 20 years ago,” said state police Commissioner Jeffrey B. Miller.  “This is a horrendous, horrific incident for the Amish community. They’re solid citizens in the community. They’re good people. They don’t deserve … no one deserves this,” Miller said.</p>
<p>The attack bore similarities to a deadly school shooting last week in Bailey, Colo., but Miller said he believed the Pennsylvania attack was not a copycat crime. “I really believe this was about this individual and what was going on inside his head,” he said.  According to investigators, Roberts dropped his children off at their bus stop, then at about 10 a.m. pulled up at the school, which had about 25 to 30 students ranging in age from six to 13.</p>
<p>Roberts brought with him supplies necessary for a lengthy siege, including three guns, a stun gun, two knives, a pile of wood and a bag with 600 rounds of ammunition, police said. He also had a change of clothing, toilet paper, bolts and hardware and rolls of clear tape.</p>
<p>He released about 15 boys, a pregnant woman and three women with infants, barred the doors with desks and wood and secured them with nails, bolts and flexible plastic ties. He then made the girls line up along a blackboard and tied their feet together.</p>
<p>The teacher and another adult fled to a nearby farmhouse, and authorities were called at about 10:30 a.m. Miller said Roberts apparently called his wife from a cell phone at around 11 a.m., saying he was taking revenge for an old grudge. Miller declined to say what the grudge could have been.  “It seems as though he wanted to attack young, female victims,” Miller said.</p>
<p>Moments later, Roberts told a dispatcher he would open fire on the children if police didn’t back away from the building. Within seconds, troopers heard gunfire, and found his body when they were able to get inside.  From the suicide notes and telephone calls, it was clear Roberts was “angry at life, he was angry at God,” and co-workers said his mood had darkened in recent days, Miller said.</p>
<p>In a statement released to reporters, the gunman’s wife, Marie Roberts, called her husband “loving, supportive and thoughtful.”  “He was an exceptional father,” she said. “He took the kids to soccer practice and games, played ball in the backyard and took our 7-year-old daughter shopping. He never said no when I asked him to change a diaper.”</p>
<p>“Our hearts are broken, our lives are shattered, and we grieve for the innocence and lives that were lost today,” she said. “Above all, please pray for the families who lost children and please pray too for our family and children.”</p>
<p>Neighbors who knew the Roberts’ family said they saw no indications of trouble brewing.  “They’re a fine Christian family. It’s ironic and it’s heartbreaking,” said Lois Fiester, a relative of Roberts who was standing outside the family’s modest tan ranch house.</p>
