              <p>I don’t think a whole new franchise is necessary. I think restarting the entirety of Runescape is though. All accounts should be wiped of their stats, inventory, and bank. Basically OSRS but reverting to right before Dunge was added, make that a minigame and then begin improving on what already exists. RS has a great base imo, but the updates became sloppy, there was no gp going out of the game, and greed overtook everything.</p>

              <p>EoC was an epic failure, and Jagex doesn’t check their damn forums so they had no idea how big of a portion of the community that was utterly against the idea of changing to a button mashing system. But of course their ego is too big and they refused to just drop the content they worked “so hard” on, so they released a shitty reworked system.</p>
<p>Then they go oh guys it’s okay we’ll make it so you get a new (yet worse) version of combat that doesn’t require you to button mash. But of course, to please everyone they add another system “revolution” to amp damage up and make it so players essentially have to click a “special” button. Only to go oh you guys really miss the special bar? Well rather than working to revert back to both an aesthetically pleasing yet original combat style, WE’RE GOING TO RELEASE ANOTHER COMBAT SYSTEM, SO NOW YOU CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT COMBAT MECHANICS. What kind of company does that???</p>
<p>I can pretty much confidently say that unless Jagex takes back their company, rights all the wrongs done to the game, and changes the cost back to a reasonable cost, I am no longer interested in playing Jagex’ version of the game.</p>

              <p>[quote=“casey., post:13, topic:543305”]IMO minus the micro-transactions, it is still a playable and decent game. EOC as a concept is not a bad idea, and if you’ve played it- it is not bad either. The problem is Jagex handling EOC delivery very poorly which drove down the player-base.[/quote]That’s a matter of opinion. I tried EoC and I can’t stand it. They tried to mix an active combat system with an inactive one, and the result didn’t cut it for me. The reason ‘abilities’ work in other games is because they aren’t on the tick system, you can pull off cool combos and have the aoe stuff, etc. EoC just feels… clunky and static to me. Basically the playstyle before EoC was ‘clunky’ as well but it did that very well rather than trying to change to an existing system and not doing it properly. They also overcomplicated everything which is another thing that drove me away. The new content seemed decent but I can’t play because a) eoc, and b) I played for the social aspect as well, and that’s utter shite now</p>

              <p>Since Dungeoneering was released it has pretty much been on a downhill slope. The amount of microtransactions and irresponsible ignorance that Jagex has had through this entire process has just resulted in a cluster fudgeed game. Everything is too easy to get. I mean you can win 200m. So as a noob level 3 I can login, do my first spin and get 200m. I have basically just been given the ability to power up to 70 combat without any monetary issues, 43 pray (even though pray is garbage now), and at least 50 in every other stat.</p>
<p>But the investors knew this the moment they became the majority holders. The plan has always been to pump microtransactions and increase revenue, whilst doing the least amount of work until the game implodes on itself and the economy collapses, players are sick of the microtransactions, and when their revenue no longer is profitable, they move on to the next game. Anyone who didn’t see this is either new to Runescape or is a fool.</p>

But with fewer worlds the players would be forced to play together and it would help revive mini-games.</p>
