    <title>Broken PSP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/broken-psp/224571</link>
    <description>A few days ago I dropped my PSP and the umd slot case casing snapped off, and made the PSP unable to read anything I put in it. I know this falls under accidental damage and the warranty wont cover this, but I was wondering whether anyone has had any experience with Sony (SCEE or SCEA) with a broken PSP or any other product. Will this service cost me? What happens if they are unable to repair the damage?

              <p>Change the firmware fo your PSP to a custom one, then download all the umd games you own and play them from your memory card. That’s what I did when my PSP couldn’t read umd’s anymore.</p>

              <p>My PS3 broke a while back but that was because it had overheated, it being in a stupid place. It was three months outside the warranty but they traded it in anyway and gave me a new one. Maybe it willbe different for accidental damage but just give 'em a ring and see what they say</p>
