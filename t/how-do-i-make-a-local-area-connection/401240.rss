              <p>is the cat5 a crossover cable? if not u need a crossover cable to do this. ive connected my 360 to xbox live via my phone data plan <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> slow and i never played a game on xbox live but ive played pc games on it.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>u go to the already created LAN connection, right click open properties. enable sharing internet through this connection or w/e it says there. thats all i had to do. u can also bridge the WLAN and LAN connections. idk there is a couple ways to do it.</p>
<p>there should be a LAN connection there automatically, if there isnt idk what to say except google the problem. make sure ur computer recognizes the wired NIC u have u may try to uninstall the driver to ur ethernet and have windows automatically install it.</p>
