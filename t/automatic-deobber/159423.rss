Ofcourse you need to understand it, otherwise you can’t even think about making a bot. I’ve been renaming 473 just to learn more about it. It’s just that you need a lot of time to make it perfect. Time is something I don’t have <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>when you install it, go to the directory of the program in the command line interpreter of your platform, and write "ant " where  is one of the ones in the build file (look in the comment of build.xml for the targets)</p>

              <p>[quote=“yakman, post:8, topic:159423”]heres a copy of saevion’s deobfuscator if thats the one you want, i learnt a lot from this, that saevion was good, too bad i never met him <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>i heard this program powered aryan, so i guess after every update, you would run this and rename some by hand or whatever.</p>
<p>so does anyone have an old copy of aryan, I’m not talking about a well renamed deob, but the whole thing, like the script system, the accessor methods thingy, those batch files called “run.bat”, “compile-scripts.bat”, “compile-controllers.bat”, “compile-randoms.bat”, and perhaps some old scripts as well, like a essence miner, yew chopper and stuff.<br>
and what are those controllers?</p>
<p>its funny about the way it walked, i heard it just clicked anywhere and replaced some walking array<br>
and what about the people around at the time, i know about regex, SeanWT, but people who hung around and knew about stuff.<br>
I once heard someone say, “but with aryan, we had much more competant developers than we had today”, so who where they?</p>
<p>in case you haven’t realised, i never used aryan, and im using this chance to ask loads of questions about it  :rolleyes:</p>
<p>heres saevion’s deobfuscator[/quote]<br>
Controllers where script that would run multiple script. Like checking tutIsland, quest if all done, run Essence Miner.<br>
People who developed around then where Taios, Nerice and ‘Impsoft’, there where more, but I was member of their sites (except IMPSoft). Badly enough they both stopped/disapeared. (I saw Nerice once in a while though). There are some people like me, who know enough of the client like they did in the Aryan timeperk. But we just don’t release it.</p>
<p>Here are some Aryan things, I’ve downloaded recently. I lost all my Aryans from that time, because of a hard format <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
