    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-subsections-discussion/345799</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;m going to ask for a civilized discussion on this topic. 

This question has been asked numerous times, with the response of &#39;When they make a good one, we will think about it.&#39; Many of you now know what I am talking about: subsection(s) for different protocols. I don&#39;t mean you need to make a new board for each, but at least a sub-board of server downloads called &#39;508+ Server Downloads&#39; or something. 

The staff response is hardly an adequate retort to this question, because people obviously don&#39;t care if there is a good one made yet, they still download it, and 508+ is getting steadily more and more popular. Unless people are going to start putting [508] or [317] on each of their topic titles, it is rather annoying having to look through each thread to even find the protocol you want to download. 

If someone wants to easily find a 508, they honestly don&#39;t care if the staff thinks &#39;there are no good 508 servers&#39;, they just want to download one. Why can&#39;t there be a subsection for the higher protocols? I would love to hear the real reason from a staff member (if there is one?) and hear everyone else&#39;s thoughts on the matter.</description>

              <p>I think this would be a good idea, However, going back to the Search function.</p>
<p>we all have to admit the Search Function on SMF Forums isn’t exactly the best thing in the world. But if you’ve looked at a vBulletin forum recently you will notice that the search function in that is actually pretty top notch (in my opinion) so really, wouldn’t it be a good idea if MITB and some of the PHP programmers got together and integrated the vB search into smf? Just a suggestion lol.</p>

Not really. Most of the sections aren’t very active, and 508 boards will just make the forum seem kind of dead. The only active section that could really use it is the Downloads section, but it’s pretty easy to get around, especially with the search bar. My vote goes to no.<br>

I agree with Davidi2. The server help is filled with retarded topics that don’t specify which revision they need help on.</p>

<p>Packaging does not relay the creator’s ethics or laziness at all. It simply shows that they took the 2 minutes it takes to add a line of code and create folders. Besides, any person that correctly programs should begin with the basics. But, regarding half of this shit we call RSPS, most are just a simple WinterLove modified for the cache revision they work with.</p>
