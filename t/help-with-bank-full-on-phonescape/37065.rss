    <title>Help with &quot;Bank Full!&quot; On PhoneScape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-bank-full-on-phonescape/37065</link>
    <description>Yes well, when i sell a PHAT to Santa, i get 2147Mill, It says &quot;Bank Full!&quot; When i try to deposit another 2147Mill, after i have already deposited 2147Mill.
I am using PhoneScape, Help would be much appreciated.
I have searched for &quot;Bank Full!&quot; In Client.Java, but their is too many to know which one it is.
Help is greatly appreciated, Thanks.</description>

              <p>you can’t have above 2147m so what you have to do is either keep in your invo or withdraw your 2147m and then re bank it.</p>
