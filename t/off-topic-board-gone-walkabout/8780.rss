    <title>&#39;Off Topic&#39; board gone walkabout?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/off-topic-board-gone-walkabout/8780</link>
    <description>Ok, i was about to send my friend a link to the post &#39;Post a picture of yourself&#39; because i was talking about everyone laughing at the fat kid. I remembered the topic being on the board &#39;Off Topic&#39;, but the boards dissapeared, along with the posts that were on it.

Anyone know what happened to it?</description>
