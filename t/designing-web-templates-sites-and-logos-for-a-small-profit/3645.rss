    <description>[center]hi guys,

        firstly and most inportantly i would just like to say this if this is seen as spam please delete it, i am doing this solely by myself and no other people or communitys will be involved.


[glow=red,2,300]My history of web design -[/glow] i have around 2 years of web design and logo making exp and am offering my services and mine alone to design and built a site for a small price. I will be providing the following services -

Logo - custom made 
frontpage - frontpage to your site
full site - a full website, each page with the same template to the front (may differ if desired)
images - custom images made

and a wide variety more, please either post a query or order or you can pm me. My preffered payment option is paypal but i may accept other payments (e.g. rs2 gp or Egold) 

Before i end this i would just like to make it clear that i would not usally offer my services for money but i kinda need to right know :),

thank you for looking,  and as i said before if this conflicts with any of our rule&#39;s pelase remove this topic.[/center]</description>
