    <title>Looking for RSPS Creator</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-rsps-creator/350348</link>
    <description>Ok.

Well I am somewhat new to the whole RSPS thing, but I was wondering if there is anyone that can create a RSPS for me.

I am asking that someone can create for me an RSPS and then make it into a playable RSPS by anyone.

I personally do not care what source or Client that you use to create it but I do ask that you can make it a fun to play sever. 

Some Features I would Like:
-An Admin/Moderator Area. Only Moderators and Admins can go there by doing Command ::Modarea
-A Donator Area. Only Donators can go here and it will include a shop with some special items such as Wings, Spirit Shields, Dragon Claws, etc. They can use coins here to by items. They get here by typing command ::donated (only works if they are actually a donator.
-Unlimited prayer Set up. I would like the prayer to never run out for people therefore eliminating the need for Prayer Potions.
-The Normal Commands like ::home, ::Shops, etc. As well as ::pure (usable by anyone) ::tank (Usable by Moderator+)
::Master (Usable by Admin+) 
-I would like all the GWD Bosses Armadyl, Saradomin, Bandos, Zamorak all with their normal drops but with the chances of good drops higher, around 75%. If they could be in a somewhat circlular format so you can swap between killing them easily and you don&#39;t have to get kills to attack them. I would also like it so they only use melee attacks and if you pray melee you dont get hit as often. I would also like it if their 3 minions are not there as they are somewhat obsolete seeing as the bosses drop everything.
-I would also like the KBD and Corporal Beast to be like the GWD Bosses. They only hit with Melee and when using the Protect from Melee Prayer you do not get hit as much. Also their normal drops but with a higher percentage of good drops.
-I would like all the skills that are available, and in order to train these skills all you have to do is click the skill you want to train and it brings you to a special place that you can train that skill at.

Any other special features that you think you could add on would be great.

If you can create a working RSPS for me like this. I will make sure that you get all the credit for creating the server.

If the creator is also able to be the hoster for the server for a while until we can get a VPS that would amazing. 

If you can do this for me please post on here or send me a private message.

Thank You,
Skillrs Live.</description>
