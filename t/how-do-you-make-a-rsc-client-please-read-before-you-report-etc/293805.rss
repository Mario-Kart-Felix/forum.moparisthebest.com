    <description>I know this is only for 317, but I don&#39;t know where to put it.

Have you EVER played Silabsoft?

You know they have their own you know client.

Like the cheesy &#39;ALWAYS AHEAD OF THE REST!&#39; Saying?

How do they do it?

IF you think that&#39;s impossible for me, how do you make those things like Loomscape AKA BoxRune???

Well instead of RS2 I want RSC

Is that EVEN Possible?

I mean don&#39;t piss me off with douche or anything.

Reply a tut or a tut link PLEASE!

Pics would be helpful

Don&#39;t know?

How do you make a client like X-Scape Webclient or something.</description>
