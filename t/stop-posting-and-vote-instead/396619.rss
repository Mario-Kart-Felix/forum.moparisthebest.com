    <title>Stop posting and vote instead</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stop-posting-and-vote-instead/396619</link>
    <description>Its my idea to remove the ability to replay on topics in this sections and instead use some sort of voting system .

Posting is very much possible on their forum, sense its more spam/annoying shit talk I think their database should handle it instead.</description>

<p>The UN has deemed about six languages to be international, and most people accept English as being <span class="bbcode-i">the</span> international language; Swedish isn’t one of those six or so, and seeing you’re communicating to an international community, you need effectively to speak in an international language, and stop getting pissed off when they point out that you suck at English, seeing you’re failing to communicate correctly.  It’s not everyone else’s fault that you don’t know an international language well enough to effectively communicate, it’s yours.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the translator generates much more coherent text than you do, so either use it or continue to be ridiculed…  If someone makes fun of you because the translator sucks, then ask them for a better one…</p>
<p>Anyway, I doubt you’ll listen, because you’re autistic (literally)…</p>

<p>Ed your just so fucking retarded I’m going to use a translater for this.<br>
Not entirely true, more than 50% of the network speak English so you must speak English so that everyone can understand what you say. It is absolutely not OK to harass someone because of he can not speak excellent English. if you can understand what he says even if his grammar is not parfekt so let it be</p>

<p>The thing is, I know I suck at Swedish (I only know a few words), which is why I don’t speak it.  If I were to attempt it, I’d obviously be using a translator; which has much better grammar, and spelling than he is using.</p>
<p>The difference is key; I realize I suck at something so I don’t do it, while he doesn’t realize he sucks at something and constantly gets mad when people tell him he sucks at it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I’m speaking the most accepted international language, so I don’t need to learn some language that only a handful of people speak.</p>

<p>I know full well calling someone a retard doesn’t automatically mean they’re mad, but given the situation, you’re mad.  Furthermore, your posts are difficult to read, and you constantly fail to convey your thoughts correctly, and then get mad at everyone else because you’re retarded.  Anyway, you exhibit several low functioning autistic behaviors; you should get that checked out.</p>

I didn’t understand what the fuck were you talking about since the words are in wrong order and your grammar is fucked up.</p>
