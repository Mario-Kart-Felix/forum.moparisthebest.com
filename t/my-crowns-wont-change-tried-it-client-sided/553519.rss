    <title>My crowns won&#39;t change -- tried it client sided</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-crowns-wont-change-tried-it-client-sided/553519</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to change the owner crown on my server (because its an admin crown???  :palm: )
I&#39;ve added it client sided and the image shows up when referenced and everything. But it won&#39;t show up when someone has an owner status and just talks. It only shows up when using ::news command (which i guess is a generic yell.. ) and the only reason it shows up then was because i edited what image it was referencing... so whats the deal here im confused lol.</description>
