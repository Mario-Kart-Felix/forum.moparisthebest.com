              <p>[quote=“Taharok, post:34, topic:422428”]His motives are obvious, but his facts are not. I watched the video for a half an hour. The ideas he was talking about regarding devaluing a currency are actually spot-on. He’s right to suggest the United States governments are significantly in debt, and the only way to pay off this debt is to print more money (well, that’s not exactly true, but that was his argument). In that sense, as the amount of currency increases, it inflates that economy and devalues the currency relative to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>One thing I am uncertain on is the devaluing concept being bad. A strong versus weak currency isn’t a good versus bad scenario. Strong and weak currencies are two opposing states, both with benefits and drawbacks. A weak U.S. dollar means that foreign investments are more expensive, exporting is generally less profitable, and prices in the United States are more expensive (aka, it sucks for us). Nevertheless, the complete opposite happens for other countries. A weak U.S. dollar means other countries can invest easier in U.S. assets, sell products to the United States for more profit, and overall enjoy the cheap U.S. prices. I would say based on that alone, his entire plan is flawed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are more complex cases to look at. Yes, we are printing more money to try and pay off debt, but most of our debt is being paid off with more debt. This isn’t because we are stupid, but because the United States holds one of the core economies in the world. This means when we aren’t doing good, we sell bonds to countries like China, who return the large stockpiles of U.S. dollars they own. It’s a very cyclical and extremely complicated process, but it’s not quite as unsound as he suggests. I won’t deny there is extreme uncertainty in the financial future of the United States, but it’s not something the entire world can escape. Even if he was entirely right in all his reasoning, the world could not afford the United State suddenly dipping into depression.</p>

<p>Just screwing around. People still gnna get owned by Zombies… If you ask me, the only people who will actually survive a zombie apocalypse are those with military experience.
