    <title>How would my computer do hosting a server of 30+?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-my-computer-do-hosting-a-server-of-30/281151</link>
    <description>Heres a pic of my system properties:

I have 257 Gigs free of 270, just if you were wondering.

[IMG]http://i40.tinypic.com/27zm8vs.jpg[/img]

I will be getting more RAM if it can&#39;t hold more than 30 smoothly.. Just tell me what you think?


EDIT: I got a question.. Does it help if I switch to the windows 98/95 theme? Because in this one thread I read that it does, but I want to get that confirmed.

Here are my speeds..

NOTE: I had about 4 internet windows open at the time of the test.</description>

              <p>That’ll do fine, but try sorting out the efficiency of the actual server source before considering your system specs. I can host between 100-200 mixed active and inactive players on an old dedicated server running linux with a single core 2Ghz processor and 1Gb of RAM.</p>

That would hold 30 easily, however, if you have a stable base you could hold in excess of 200 or 300.</p>

don’t be so sure, you never asked about an internet connection he might be running a 512k dial up setup for all you know, so the question remains what internet speed have you got, if you don’t know use <a href="http://speedtest.net" rel="nofollow noopener">speedtest.net</a>[/quote]</p>
<p>K, just uploaded a pic.</p>

<p>For some reason they brand my processor as 3.06GHz when actualty its 3.07GHz when rounded.<br>

<p>As for interent speed, Upload speed is the most important when running a sever.</p>
<p>edit: I have just seen your internet speed and it does not look great but you still should hold a lot of people with a decent source.</p>
