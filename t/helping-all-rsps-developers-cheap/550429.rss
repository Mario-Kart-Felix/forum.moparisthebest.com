    <description>Hey everyone! 
I am here to offer anyone and everyone help with their server from things as simple as getting port forwarded to being as complex as developing an entire server! I will also be selling my source for a pretty cheap price.

I am willing to help out for as cheap as FREE it just depends on what you need done!

I can:

Create Websites.
Create Forums.
Maintain Youtube Channels + Create Promo Videos.
Script Java Server and Client sided.
Code in Custom features on both Server and Client Side.
Create custom working Interfaces for both Server and Client side. 
Trouble shoot just about anything. 
and lastly the most common thing I find myself doing for people is &quot;Port Forwarding&quot; your server. 

I understand that I was pretty broad spoken with this post. I also understand most people would like pictures to determine the chance of using my services but I can go from making you something well done and professional like Ikov or just get you something simple and easy like I have on my beta server. Everything is just determined by the quality in which you want. But I will PROMISE you, if you want it done, I&#39;ll get it done!

Skype me for more information!
