    <title>[New-PI] ItemonObject Packet not working as expected?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-pi-itemonobject-packet-not-working-as-expected/527113</link>
    <description>So this is really weird, and something I&#39;ve never experienced before.
I was trying to add in support for smithing and when I was adding the use item on object (meaning using the bars on the object) it wouldn&#39;t work. Couldn&#39;t figure out why. First, I blamed the case, and then I blamed the interface. Neither were wrong.
So I added debug code:
[code=java]
		if(c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Sk8r&quot;)){
			c.sendMessage(&quot;ItemOnObject: &quot;+objectID+&quot; Item:&quot;+itemId);
		}
[/code]

And this is what prints out..

I used the bronze bar (Item ID: 2349) on 4 objects (a tree, cooking utensils, altar, and something else).
Obviously that isn&#39;t correct. Why is it messing up like this? Lol.</description>
