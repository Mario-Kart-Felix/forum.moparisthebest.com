    <title>Client Background Help [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-background-help-317/525417</link>
    <description>Hello, I changed the client background of my client, renamed it to background (exact name previous one was named), in the place it was - this one was in the client folder, not in the Sprites folder. I tried:


[ul][li]Putting the background in both the client folder and Sprites folder,[/li]
[li]Changing line 43 on Class 30_Sub_2_Sub_1_Sub_1 from ./background.png to /Sprites/background.png[/li][/ul]


Nothing has worked, the client straight away goes onto the error screen and by using Z-File Searcher I have searched the word background with 0 results and image, yet the solution I tried already does not work. I&#39;m not sure what to do. Can anyone help please? Thanks.</description>
