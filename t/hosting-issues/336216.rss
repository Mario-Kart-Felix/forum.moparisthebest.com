    <title>Hosting Issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hosting-issues/336216</link>
    <description>OK, so I have hosting issues at my own house. So my cousin offered to host our P server. OK, his operation system is Windows Vista Home Premium, Service Pack One, which i have no knowledge about(I have Xp). His router is a 2link(I have linksys). I have no idea what I&#39;m doing... I&#39;ve ran and hosted my own server. But can&#39;t understand his computer. If anyone can help by adding my Msn(samtherule@hotmail.com)... Skype(samtherule)... or Email(samtherule@gmail.com). I&#39;ll tell you the teamviewer stuff.
Thanks
-Sam
