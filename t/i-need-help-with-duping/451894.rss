    <title>I need help.... with duping</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-duping/451894</link>
    <description>Hello, my problem is a bad case of dupping. I&#39;m not really sure how I can patch this. So I&#39;ll explain
how it is done, in full detail. Please help me.

This is just what I&#39;ve seen.

First step: One person gets what ever items they want to dupe, (Noted form).
Second Step: The person find another player to help them out to do it.
Third Step: They both go out into the wild and the one with the items skulls on the other.
Fourth Step: Then the other person, (the one not skulled) does about 5 damage, (there level 3&#39;s with 10 hp).
5th Step: Then they both go some where to hide near a monster (in this case dark beast.) 
Sixth Step: The one who did not get a skull logs out.
Seventh Step: Then the one with the items gets killed by the Dark Beast. loosing the items.
8th Step: The one with no skull logs back in, and find the stuff on the ground. and it&#39;s all doubled.

So far All I&#39;ve done is just disable the wild for now, not really sure what to do, someone help me please!

Thank you!</description>
