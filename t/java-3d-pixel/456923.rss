    <title>Java 3D / Pixel?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-3d-pixel/456923</link>
    <description>Okay, well im new to this part of the website first off.

So basically ive been working with java and other languages for a while, been making a few games and so on, 2d and a few pixelated like hell 3d.


Well now im currently working on a rpg in java, figured it would be a good sideproject while im in college. Issue im currently at is getting the pixels of a rotated model without using a gameengine like jme3 or any of the others.


So any idea on how i would go about getting the pixels of the rotated model?</description>
