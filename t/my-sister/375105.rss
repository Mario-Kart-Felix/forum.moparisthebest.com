    <title>My sister</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-sister/375105</link>
    <description>So my mom asked me to head to the store and buy christmas presents and decorations for my 7 year old sister&#39;s christmas celebrations at school. I&#39;ve spent 40 minutes of my life (40 minutes which I had planned to spend sleeping before I head out to training) picking decorations, untangling balloons that were tangled as hell, watching her complain about the store, change her decisions three times at least, then finally settling on a 6 face puzzle that completely sucks balls.

We then proceeded to move out of the store when she tells me &quot;Well it took you long enough!&quot;.
So now you can see how hairy the nuts my life sucks are.</description>
