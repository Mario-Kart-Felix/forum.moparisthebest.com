    <title>[req] List of ALL the ports a private server uses</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-list-of-all-the-ports-a-private-server-uses/1366</link>
    <description>I use a belkin 802.11g wireless router. I have signed up with no-ip. But nobody can connect to my server because my router is blocking people coming in. NOTE: the private server is not on the computer the router is connected to, its connected to my computer upstairs. So, i was wondering if I can have a list of all the ports than can/will be used with my server  :)

NOTE: I am using WhiteScape server source.


Help would be highly appreciated  :cool:</description>
