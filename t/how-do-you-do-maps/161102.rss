    <title>How do you do maps</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-do-maps/161102</link>
    <description>im making a small 2d rpg for a final project, how do you do the background terrain so that when you move the screen stays centered on you? (like runescape)

i had an idea where i set the JFrame size to 200 by 200 and have a huge 5000 by 5000 background image moving behind it but im not sure if that is the most efficient way</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>If you are using sprites, you should have some sort of array for each the columns and each sprite in those columns. When you are painting, use an offset and loop through the arrays until only the screen is covered with the certain section of map. Then, when the character moves, increase or decrease the offset so that the map paints the next or previous columns/rows.</p>
<p>If you are using one large image, then if it is a BufferedImage, you can use BufferedImage.getSubimage() to get the current offset place of where the character is standing. However, I do not recommend that you use one large image, as it will consume more memory and cpu usage as you continually repaint the game.</p>

<p>? something like that :0</p>
<p>and no that is not the most effective way, if you will store the ground sprites (if you are using them) into an array you can do a for loop and ++ or â€“ the sprites coords depending on move</p>
