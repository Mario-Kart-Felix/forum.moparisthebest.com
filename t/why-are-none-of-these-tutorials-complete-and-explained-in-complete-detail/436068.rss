    <title>Why are none of these tutorials complete and explained in complete detail</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-are-none-of-these-tutorials-complete-and-explained-in-complete-detail/436068</link>
    <description>Hi guys look I am completely new to coding, I came here in hopes of finding a complete tutorial on how to make from start to finish inc. server developement-complete, client developement-complete,cache developement-complete also with instructions on how and where to edit all the editable game content.
So far all the guides are incomplete even the ones named complete aren&#39;t full guides there is always something left out where can I find what I am looking for? as I want to make a complete rsps from scratch and want to make the latest version with the best possible graphics, can someone please link me.
To all those who placed a tutorial thats not complete nor explained thouroughly please DON&#39;T bother in future it&#39;s just wasteing ppl&#39;s time and your own.</description>

              <p>Thanks guys I have just finishing off coding a 639 some of the tips I got here were of use but still a little confused on some of it…sorry but I am only just starting to code, and have just finished a 639 to which I only claim no more than 10% credit most of it was done but had 100 errors,npc bugs and some major in game bugs which I cleaned out and there was no clip mode.<br>
The game ran fine for about a week then just stopped loading, any ideas? all I did was delete 1 line of shop sale and saved then compiled, however I deleted line 23 and didnt rename 24 as 23 and 25 as 24 before I cmpliled directly after this I could login but won’t load.<br>
I believe it’s because I didn’t set the shop list in the correct order as nothing else was changed to cause this problem, but how do I access my shop editor as everytime I run it now it will simply not run it will only display the start up screen. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>Well, you don’t want the exact file, as the JDK has updated since update 11. You’ll probably want to go with either the latest release of Java 7 or the most updated Java 6.</p>
