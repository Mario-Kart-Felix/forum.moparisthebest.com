    <title>Need Help Starting Server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-starting-server/162306</link>
    <description>I am tired of looking for servers to join, so i want to make a new server.
just wanted to throw that out to everyone, lol.
but seriously, i need help creating/editing a close-to-perfect runescape server.
i want to partner up with someone who i know will hang with it and work on a new runescape server with me
now, im not like others and just want some good coders to come and code a server with me, 
i want someone/(or people) to commit to this server and work on it till it hits close-to-perfect (no server is perfect)
so with those few sentences being said, im calling out to whoever thinks they can be helpful.
Note: if you dont want to help me, please dont spam this.
PS if this should be in a diff section, im sorry in advance! :|</description>
