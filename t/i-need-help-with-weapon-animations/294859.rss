              <p>Alright ill make this simple for u.</p>
<p>Go into Client.java</p>
<p>Search for this "public int GetStandAnim(int id) " Or something similar to it anyway.</p>
<p>next u should see things like this under it:</p>
<p><code>}
if(id == 746 || id == 667 || id == 35 || id == 2402 || id == 8100) 
{
return 2450;
}</code></p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>The id ==746 is the item that u will effect (the stance of the weapon)<br>
(BTW All of those ID’s are Gs’s in delta bases.)</p>
<p>Now the return 2450 is the thing U have to replace with 1131, the number cocoa gave for the new gs emote.</p>
<p>compile it and ur done, not very hard and if u check the post in cocoas thread u will see this has been posted several times.</p>
