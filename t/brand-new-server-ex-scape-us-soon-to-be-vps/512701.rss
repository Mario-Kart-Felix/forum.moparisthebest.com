    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/brand-new-server-ex-scape-us-soon-to-be-vps/512701</link>
    <description>This is a brand new rsps. The features of this rsps are ridiculous! There is so much to do and even though we are only 4 days online, we have already amassed approximately 30 regular players and we need more! We will be on a vps soon and we are constantly improving the game even more! The GE is currently being worked on, it was up and running, however there was a glitch in the prices (minor) and it has been taken down for review. We are constantly improving the game and we just need more players to come enjoy it with us! This is an eco based server! Please come join us! This rsps is like no other I promise you won&#39;t be disappointed!!

You can switch between old rs look or new rs look! How cool is that? (rhetorical)</description>
