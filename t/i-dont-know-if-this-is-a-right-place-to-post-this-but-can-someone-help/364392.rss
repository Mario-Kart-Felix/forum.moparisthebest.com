    <title>I don&#39;t know if this is a right place to post this, but can someone help?</title>

    <description>I was wondering if anyone knows how I can set up my phone (LG Ally, Android OS, Verizon) so it will let me connect to my computer via wifi.
I want to be able to be far away from my home computer, and then I run an application on my phone and it will let me see what has been typed, downloaded, browsing history, etc. on my computer.
Is there a way to set up my phone to connect to my computer and view these files no matter where I am as long as I have internet on my computer and phone?</description>
