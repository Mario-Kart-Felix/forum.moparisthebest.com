              <p>Look in the client.java in your <span class="bbcode-b">client</span> folder and search for the IP and port. Make sure the IP is 127.0.0.1 (this is localhost) and the port should be 43594 (as it is the most common port for RuneScape private servers).</p>
<p>Then make sure the port is the same on your sever as it is in your client. Download a client and server from the download section (make sure it comes as a package) and then you may have more luck connecting.</p>
<p>You may also have to portforward and set your Environment Variables, aside from download the Java Development Kit to compile your server.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
