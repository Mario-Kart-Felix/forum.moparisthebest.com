    <description>hey so im Wkdpkz. Pretty new to the forums, although i&#39;ve been playing mopar for a while.. Some of you may know me and recognise my name and thats why you visited my forums!!:Pwell to get to the point..
Today i figured out that there was a problem when i tried to go on www.moparisthebest.com.. well i came on here to have a look and i realised that many other people we&#39;re having that very same problem.
The Problem seems to be that when you try to open your client there will be a RED X Now i read through some of the topics and tried to figure out the problem and in the end.. i DID. Now that i had the new JAVA version my client was up and running as normal..
UNTIL
That very same RED X appeared again  :cool:, now i then went onto downloading java again and again.. and even downloaded the client a few times but its still not working!!
occasionally, the ORANGE java box will pop up for around 5 seconds and then the red X will appear again. I would like TO know if someone could help me please as i want to get back to playing asap.

THANKYOU
