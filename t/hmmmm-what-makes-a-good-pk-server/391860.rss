    <title>HMMMM... what makes a good PK server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hmmmm-what-makes-a-good-pk-server/391860</link>
    <description>Okay so it&#39;s final; I have decided to make a PK server.

I&#39;m highly against making normal players spawn though, because if they had this ability then the server wouldn&#39;t be much fun.

I hear fast leveling will draw people&#39;s attention, is this true or fals?

Anyways, just list a few ideas if you can.

Thanks, Mike</description>

              <p>I have a ::master command for Admins and Owners. I actually have played Near-reality, thats what inspired me to make a PK server. Only one problem, I can’t code a pk server myself. I’m going to need some help and lots of time. (both are scarce)</p>
<p>Thanks for your input. I will keep this in mind.</p>
<p>P.S. Do you happen to know Near-Reality’s combat experience rate?</p>

              <p>Some people are attracted to the servers that offer ::master and ::pure commands and if you dont know what those are master gives 99 all skills pure gives the skills off a good pure.  Tbh i dont like either of those commands because it allows players to be equally powerful and not much fun its basically all just luck on who hits highest, but servers such as Near-Reality which is <span class="hashtag">#1</span> on runelocus offer super fast leveling i played it and got 99 strength and attack in like 10 minutes and they have 2000+ players so i would say faster leveling brings in a pretty big crowd, although there non-combat skills take FOREVER to level <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
