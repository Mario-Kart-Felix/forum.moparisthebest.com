    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-message-needs-to-be-removed/358257</link>
    <description>Well it comes to my opinion that 4chan can be good at time and at other times they can destroy people&#39;s lives. Like the current attack on Justin Beiber&#39;s baby video would be a great example of the good they can do.

So if you would like to start a group like 4chan, how would you go about doing it? What would you make the site like? and how would you spam, destroy, and help, on the internet? In my mind 4chan is the dictator of a large portion of the internet, and can go to show how much people can sway the vote so to say.

I post this because of my studies about the site and it&#39;s mysterious creator, and the immense amount of times that the site has come to my attention.</description>

              <p>Well it comes to my opinion that 4chan can be good at time and at other times they can destroy people’s lives. Like the current attack on Justin Beiber’s baby video would be a great example of the good they can do.</p>
<p>So if you would like to start a group like 4chan, how would you go about doing it? What would you make the site like? and how would you spam, destroy, and help, on the internet? In my mind 4chan is the dictator of a large portion of the internet, and can go to show how much people can sway the vote so to say.</p>
<p>I post this because of my studies about the site and it’s mysterious creator, and the immense amount of times that the site has come to my attention.</p>
