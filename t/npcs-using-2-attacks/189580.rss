    <title>Npcs using 2 attacks</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npcs-using-2-attacks/189580</link>
    <description>I was planning on making a new fight cave minigame out of the old torso minigame from project destiny and I have all the fight cave monster emotes. Except the mage attacks for ket-zek and tz-xil or whatever his name is, the one that shoots spikes out of his back. I have the jads 3 attacks but I thought if i could just make the other 2 monsters 2 attacks, it didn&#39;t work. Could anyone help me on how to make an npc use 2 attacks on a player? I&#39;ll send the emotes I am trying to use and the ids

Ket-Zek id [code]2743[/code]

Emotion for his magic attack [code]2647[/code]

Tok-Xil id [code]2739[/code]

Emotion for his range attack [code]2633[/code]

Thanks</description>
