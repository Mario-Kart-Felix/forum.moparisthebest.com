Warrock is a massive professional private server that brings a whole new environment to gaming. 
It comes with diverse quests and gameplay unique to the server,
 a plethora of cities to visit, and countless activities to be enjoyed. 
We strive for perfection in economic balance as PvMers and Pkers alike. 
This isn&#39;t to be considered the average private server where you will get bored within a weeks time. 
Our dedicated developers will be constantly adding new content for your enjoyment. 

We plan to expand the server beyond just teleports and commonly used
 points of interest and will provide detailed content for you to spend hours enjoying;
 as the whole land of Runescape is planned to be used.

- Minigames 100% working (duel arena, pest control, tzhaar fight caves, tzhaar fight pits, ..-
