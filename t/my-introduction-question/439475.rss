    <description>Hello there, my shane is shimpo, you can call me shane though. New to this forum but have been using it on and off for years now.
I play a few rsps servers aswell as runescape, Im looking to create and run my own rsps I have a mass amount of people that would join said rsps if im too make one.    These are players from other servers and real life friends that would join, also alot of people and websites to advertise, Im not so good at making rsps so if anyone wants to help me with this it would be much appericiated.   there will be payment if someone can help me threw the entire process and do it well, also if they want they can co-own the server with myself and any donation rewards will be 50/50.   If i own my own server i can almost be certain it will be successful ( i hope ) if anyone can help me Private message me or email me @ Shane-blue@hotmail.com   
thanks all</description>
