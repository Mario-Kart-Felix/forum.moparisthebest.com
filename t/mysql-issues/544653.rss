    <title>MYSQL Issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mysql-issues/544653</link>
    <description>So I am able to run my server, but it does not open up port 43594. I am suspecting it&#39;s due to dead MySQL&#39;s that are located somewhere in the files. Does anyone know how to remove these? I mean I know you would obviously comment them out, but what exactly do I search for? &quot;MySql&quot; ? Help would be very much appreciated.</description>

Download the tool from the link I gave you. It also has a port checker built into it. It’s a lot better than <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> 's.<br>

<p>Well either way I am not able to connect to it. This is being hosted on a VPS as well. I am 100% sure it has to do with the MySQL. It is the old NR source that was released. I am just not sure how to remove it. :/[/quote]<br>
Like I said.<br>
MySQL runs on port 3306. RSPS runs on 43594 or 5555. MySQL doesn’t block port 43594 unless you for some reason reconfigure it to not be on port 3306 and to be on one of the RSPS’s. And if you did, the RSPS would error in 1 of 2 ways: 1) The server cannot bind to 43594/5555 because MySQL is already bound OR 2) MySQL cannot be bound to 43594/3306 because the RSPS is on it.</p>

It has absolutely NOTHING to do with MySQL or any other form of player serialization. In fact it has nothing to do with the source itself. The VPS is blocking it through the firewall or some other means. If you can’t figure out how to open the port then ask your provider for some assistance.</p>

If the checker cannot see you, possible reasons are:<br>
Firewall blocking it<br>
Anti-malware/anti-virus blocking it<br>
your network ip changed (not the same as your broadcast one) thus the portforward not working anymore<br>
you didn’t activate the port forwarding correctly<br>
you aren’t checking the port is active when the server is running.<br>
another application is running on the port causing it to be “blocked” (Though the server would error saying it couldn’t bind to 43594)<br>
and so much more.</p>

Open the port in your router and your firewall. If you do not know how, google a guide for your router in specific or you can try <a href="http://simpleportforwarding.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this port forwarding tool</a>.<br>
The tool does <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> open the port in any firewall or antivirus, you must do that yourself.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well when I run the server, it listens on port 43594. With this particular source, when I use a port checker, it can not seem to detect port 43594. So I’m guessing it’s the MySQL, which is why I need it to be removed. I just added port 3306 and still no luck:/</p>

              <p>MySQL has nothing to do with port 43594 as it runs on port 3306.<br>
Open the port in your router and your firewall. If you do not know how, google a guide for your router in specific or you can try <a href="http://simpleportforwarding.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this port forwarding tool</a>.<br>
The tool does <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> open the port in any firewall or antivirus, you must do that yourself.</p>

              <p>So I am able to run my server, but it does not open up port 43594. I am suspecting it’s due to dead MySQL’s that are located somewhere in the files. Does anyone know how to remove these? I mean I know you would obviously comment them out, but what exactly do I search for? “MySql” ? Help would be very much appreciated.</p>
