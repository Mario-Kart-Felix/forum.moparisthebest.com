    <description>Hello. 

This tutorial is for anyone who wants to set up a Hyperion server, but doesn&#39;t know how.

[b]Difficulty:[/b] Should be 1/10; if you follow step-by-step.
[b]Requirements:[/b] All you need is Hyperion, a 317 client and Eclipse IDE (you can use other IDE&#39;s, but this is the one I&#39;m going to be using).

[b][size=4][u]Getting The Files We Need[/b]
You&#39;re going to need to download three things:

[b]Hyperion:[/b] http://www.mediafire.com/?wvmwlaj7fw6355a [b]([/b]this is [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=23929]blakeman8192[/url]&#39;s creation[b])[/b]
[b]317 Client:[/b] http://www.mediafire.com/?0wpnhh5mw299pcg [b]([/b]this is [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=24]Miss Silabsoft[/url]&#39;s client[b])[/b]
[b]Eclipse IDE:[/b] http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

[URL=http://img256.imageshack.us/i/eclipse1w.png/][IMG]http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/4449/eclipse1w.png[/img][/URL]

[b][size=4][u]Next Step - Installing and Extracting[/b]
Once you have downloaded the 3 files, you need to install Eclipse and extract Hyperion and the 317 client. 

Just for good measure; select &quot;Extract Here&quot; for Hyperion and &quot;Extract to Silabsoft 317 Client\&quot; for the client, otherwise you&#39;ll have all the files scattered about your Desktop (providing you saved it here).

[b][size=4][u]Setting Up Eclipse[/b]
I have the portable version of Eclipse, so I&#39;ve never actually installed it. The installation should be pretty straight forward. If for any reason there is any difficult steps installing Eclipse for the first time, please submit your problem here, and someone will be happy to help. 

[URL=http://img8.imageshack.us/i/eclip2.png/][IMG]http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/4766/eclip2.png[/img][/URL]

After the splash screen appears, it will load up and display the welcome screen. Simply select close on the tab at the top of your screen to begin.

[URL=http://img688.imageshack.us/i/closeeclip.png/][IMG]http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/2677/closeeclip.png[/img][/URL]

Now, first of all you want to familiarize yourself with Eclipse. Eclipse is an amazingly powerful tool, especially for developing a private server. It can flag up your errors, take you to them and even suggest a soloution! 

It may look daunting the first time you open the application, but it gets easier to navigate after a while.

Click on a &quot;New [b]Java[/b] Project&quot; (you must select the little black arrow):

[URL=http://img813.imageshack.us/i/eclipnew.png/][IMG]http://img813.imageshack.us/img813/2492/eclipnew.png[/img][/URL]

You will be presented with a window with 4 black titled boxes. We are only interested in the first black titled box. Click on the second radio button, because we don&#39;t want to create a server from scratch :P and then select &quot;Browse&quot;:

[URL=http://img137.imageshack.us/i/existeclip.png/][IMG]http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/1363/existeclip.png[/img][/URL]

Navigate to the place where you saved Hyperion; I always save on my Desktop as it is easier to find my recent files (beware, if you move the folder after you have set the directory of the existing source, you may have to browse for the folder again).

It will automatically name the folder for you, but you can call it anything you like, double check it has the directory you want and select &quot;Finish&quot; at the bottom:

[URL=http://img72.imageshack.us/i/finishopen.png/][IMG]http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/9933/finishopen.png[/img][/URL]

So you now have Hyperion uploaded to Eclipse. Before we can run this though, you need to declare a few settings. Pay close attention.




----------
[i]Please note: in this section of the tutorial, I was going to show &quot;Configuring Build Path&quot; and &quot;Adding External JARs&quot;. In the Arithon #474 private server, you had to add two external JARs, but it became apparent to me that the Hyperion folder does not include these, hencefourth I assume that they do not need to be declared.

Once I have verification, I shall edit this out. If they need to be added then I will complete the tutorial from here, explaining the next step. Hope it works, if not, bear with me and I&#39;ll add the pictures in as soon as I can.[/i]
----------




Now we need to set the &quot;Run Configurations&quot;:

[URL=http://img262.imageshack.us/i/runaseclip.png/][IMG]http://img262.imageshack.us/img262/6650/runaseclip.png[/img][/URL]

Double click on &quot;Java Application&quot; and it will create &quot;New Configuration&quot; just under it, we need to declare the Main class for the server to initialize when we want to run it. So click on search:

[URL=http://img23.imageshack.us/i/searchey.png/][IMG]http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/5256/searchey.png[/img][/URL]

Highlight &quot;Sever - org.hyperion&quot; by clicking once on it, and then select &quot;Ok&quot;:

[URL=http://img687.imageshack.us/i/orgeclipse.png/][IMG]http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/7162/orgeclipse.png[/img][/URL]

Finally, we need to set the arguments (like in your tyical Run.bat)

Simply select the &quot;Arguments&quot; tab next to &quot;Main&quot;, and in the &quot;VM arguments&quot; box, type &quot;-Xmx512m&quot; and then select &quot;Apply&quot;:

[URL=http://img502.imageshack.us/i/vme.png/][IMG]http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/8928/vme.png[/img][/URL]

Select &quot;Run&quot;, this should build your workspace automatically (compile) and then initialize your server (Run). It may take 10 - 20 seconds to build and initiate the server. After it has loaded up all the appropriate files, it will finish with &quot;INFO: Ready&quot;. 

You have now successfully ran your Hyperion server for the first time.

[URL=http://img202.imageshack.us/i/ready0.png/][IMG]http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/6223/ready0.png[/img][/URL]

Load up your client (Silabsoft 317 will download the cache first, so be patient) and then login:

[URL=http://img638.imageshack.us/i/therewegon.png/][IMG]http://img638.imageshack.us/img638/6301/therewegon.png[/img][/URL]

[b][size=4][u]Credits[/b]
I&#39;d like to thank:

[b]Miss Silabsoft[/b] for her client;
[b]blakeman8192[/b] and his associates for his beautiful Hyperion;
[b]Scape-JAVA[/b] for telling me to &quot;go for it&quot;.

[i]Lastly, I take pride in my work, so if you spot any information incorrect (spelling, grammar, dead links etc.) then please let me know. I want to keep this mantained to my best ability.

I hope this opens up a few doors for people.[/i]

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Hyperion:</span> <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?wvmwlaj7fw6355a" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mediafire.com/?wvmwlaj7fw6355a</a> <span class="bbcode-b">(</span>this is <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=23929" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">blakeman8192</a>’s creation<span class="bbcode-b">)</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">317 Client:</span> <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?0wpnhh5mw299pcg" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mediafire.com/?0wpnhh5mw299pcg</a> <span class="bbcode-b">(</span>this is <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=24" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Miss Silabsoft</a>’s client<span class="bbcode-b">)</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Eclipse IDE:</span> <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://img256.imageshack.us/i/eclipse1w.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/4449/eclipse1w.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=4][u]Next Step - Installing and Extracting</span><br>
Once you have downloaded the 3 files, you need to install Eclipse and extract Hyperion and the 317 client.</p>
<p>Just for good measure; select “Extract Here” for Hyperion and “Extract to Silabsoft 317 Client” for the client, otherwise you’ll have all the files scattered about your Desktop (providing you saved it here).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=4][u]Setting Up Eclipse</span><br>
I have the portable version of Eclipse, so I’ve never actually installed it. The installation should be pretty straight forward. If for any reason there is any difficult steps installing Eclipse for the first time, please submit your problem here, and someone will be happy to help.</p>
<p><a href="http://img8.imageshack.us/i/eclip2.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/4766/eclip2.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>After the splash screen appears, it will load up and display the welcome screen. Simply select close on the tab at the top of your screen to begin.</p>
<p><a href="http://img688.imageshack.us/i/closeeclip.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/2677/closeeclip.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Now, first of all you want to familiarize yourself with Eclipse. Eclipse is an amazingly powerful tool, especially for developing a private server. It can flag up your errors, take you to them and even suggest a soloution!</p>
<p>It may look daunting the first time you open the application, but it gets easier to navigate after a while.</p>
<p>Click on a “New <span class="bbcode-b">Java</span> Project” (you must select the little black arrow):</p>
<p><a href="http://img813.imageshack.us/i/eclipnew.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img813.imageshack.us/img813/2492/eclipnew.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>You will be presented with a window with 4 black titled boxes. We are only interested in the first black titled box. Click on the second radio button, because we don’t want to create a server from scratch <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> and then select “Browse”:</p>
<p><a href="http://img137.imageshack.us/i/existeclip.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/1363/existeclip.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Navigate to the place where you saved Hyperion; I always save on my Desktop as it is easier to find my recent files (beware, if you move the folder after you have set the directory of the existing source, you may have to browse for the folder again).</p>
<p>It will automatically name the folder for you, but you can call it anything you like, double check it has the directory you want and select “Finish” at the bottom:</p>
<p><a href="http://img72.imageshack.us/i/finishopen.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/9933/finishopen.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>So you now have Hyperion uploaded to Eclipse. Before we can run this though, you need to declare a few settings. Pay close attention.</p>
<hr>
<p>[i]Please note: in this section of the tutorial, I was going to show “Configuring Build Path” and “Adding External JARs”. In the Arithon <span class="hashtag">#474</span> private server, you had to add two external JARs, but it became apparent to me that the Hyperion folder does not include these, hencefourth I assume that they do not need to be declared.</p>
<h2>Once I have verification, I shall edit this out. If they need to be added then I will complete the tutorial from here, explaining the next step. Hope it works, if not, bear with me and I’ll add the pictures in as soon as I can.[/i]</h2>
<p>Now we need to set the “Run Configurations”:</p>
<p><a href="http://img262.imageshack.us/i/runaseclip.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img262.imageshack.us/img262/6650/runaseclip.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Double click on “Java Application” and it will create “New Configuration” just under it, we need to declare the Main class for the server to initialize when we want to run it. So click on search:</p>
<p><a href="http://img23.imageshack.us/i/searchey.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/5256/searchey.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Highlight “Sever - org.hyperion” by clicking once on it, and then select “Ok”:</p>
<p><a href="http://img687.imageshack.us/i/orgeclipse.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/7162/orgeclipse.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Finally, we need to set the arguments (like in your tyical Run.bat)</p>
<p>Simply select the “Arguments” tab next to “Main”, and in the “VM arguments” box, type “-Xmx512m” and then select “Apply”:</p>
<p><a href="http://img502.imageshack.us/i/vme.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/8928/vme.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Select “Run”, this should build your workspace automatically (compile) and then initialize your server (Run). It may take 10 - 20 seconds to build and initiate the server. After it has loaded up all the appropriate files, it will finish with “INFO: Ready”.</p>
<p>You have now successfully ran your Hyperion server for the first time.</p>
<p><a href="http://img202.imageshack.us/i/ready0.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/6223/ready0.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Load up your client (Silabsoft 317 will download the cache first, so be patient) and then login:</p>
<p><a href="http://img638.imageshack.us/i/therewegon.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img638.imageshack.us/img638/6301/therewegon.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=4][u]Credits</span><br>
I’d like to thank:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Miss Silabsoft</span> for her client;<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">blakeman8192</span> and his associates for his beautiful Hyperion;<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Scape-JAVA</span> for telling me to “go for it”.</p>
<p>[i]Lastly, I take pride in my work, so if you spot any information incorrect (spelling, grammar, dead links etc.) then please let me know. I want to keep this mantained to my best ability.</p>
<p>I hope this opens up a few doors for people.[/i]</p>
