    <title>Server source that has SQL?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-source-that-has-sql/218271</link>
    <description>May somebody please point me in the right direction towards a source that has MySQL integrated into it.

I would appreciate it if someone would help me out by giving me a link if possible, or if its an old source the name is fine.

I ahve already tried SQLscape and I am having trouble with it, if i have no other choice, I will figure the SQLscape source again.


Maybe you guys can help me solve the SQLscape server problem:

It connects to the database and everything, but it says the following:
[code]
ERROR LOADING (ItemList) : Illegal operation on empty result set.[/code]


Thankyou very much for helping me guys,
