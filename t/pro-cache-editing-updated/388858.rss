<p>Thats the wrong way to do it, if you do it that way it requires the server to load the textures from the client which creates lag and more problems.

And no I’m not wrong, what I’m doing requires a lot more than adding a texture into the cache, this way you can add textures into an area without over writing the same textures in every other area.

<p>Why the hell would anyone be loading textures from the server? That’s just fucking retarded, and I don’t know of ANY implementation that does this. As for your comment about overwriting textures in every other area, you obviously have no idea what you’re talking about. A simple edit of the flo.dat(floor) file in the cache can do exactly what you’re doing. All you have to do is find the tile that you’re interested in editing, change the texture id of that tile and boom, you’re done. As asshole_rule said</p>

<p>I’m not loading textures from the server, thats what he wanted me to do. Now if your dumbass could read correctly before you post stupid shit maybe you would sound smart. Obviously you have no idea why I made this thread, and I asked how I did I didn’t ask for some dumbass remark telling me its not hard to do. I know its not a hard thing to do, that wasn’t the fucking point. Now if you’d excuse me I’m going to work on my server base and then show my development, maybe then you dumbasses wouldn’t post a dumb reply saying this isn’t hard.[/quote]</p>
<p>rofl zyle said nothing in his post about loading a texture through the server, it is you who needs to read more carefully.</p>
<p>and btw, stuff like this was accomplished 3 or more years ago, so i dont see what the  importance of this is.</p>

<p>Actually you’re wrong. Theres no changing numbers or images involved, this has to do with a lot of different things including colors, shapes, sizes, heights, and a lot more. And the reason I called it “Pro Cache Editing” is because I used “Pro Cache Editor” to edit it.<br>

<p>Actually you’re wrong. If you’re doing all that to change one texture, you’re doing it wrong. The MOST you have to do is add a texture entry into the cache, and then in client do</p>
<p><code>
if(textureId == oldTexture) {
    textureId = newTexture;

<p>and you.</p>
<p>Packing a cache to load the texture is better instead of asking the client to look if this texture is being used, then change it to another texture if it is.</p>
<p>Asshole, your arrogance is what makes other countries portray Americans as stupid. Remove yourself from the gene pool. The meaning of development is developing something that is different from the original product. As far as whether you think its development and going backwards, is simply opinion.</p>
<p>Ontopic: As far as I can tell, you’re creating an original home area. If you’re doing that, make sure to keep things blended well and keep things such as portals or ships (to move players to other islands/areas) close together without having to move far away.</p>

<p>Your false sense of arrogance makes me mad. My point was this isn’t worth a development, a fucking monkey could do this. You’re not hot shit because you can change a texture.</p>

<p>Actually you’re wrong. If you’re doing all that to change one texture, you’re doing it wrong. The MOST you have to do is add a texture entry into the cache, and then in client do</p>

    textureId = newTexture;

<p>Well, I’m trying to update the look of the game, and make more room for players to roam around. The reason why I added the ponds around the bank is so players could have an area to fish in Yanille, the other area is kinda complicating. Plus I am going to regulate the ground height a little bit and make more areas to place objects etc.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>

<p>Are you talking about a custom map from scratch? I was going to build one from scratch on a flat area but I haven’t got a hang of the object editing part yet so its kinda hard to build walls etc. But thanks for the comment!</p>
