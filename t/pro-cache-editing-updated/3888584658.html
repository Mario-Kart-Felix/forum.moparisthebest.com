<p>Thats the wrong way to do it, if you do it that way it requires the server to load the textures from the client which creates lag and more problems. The way I’m doing it makes it so the client loads the textures and no work is required from the server. And no I’m not wrong, what I’m doing requires a lot more than adding a texture into the cache, this way you can add textures into an area without over writing the same textures in every other area. If you knew anything about using the program I’m using you wouldn’t be telling me I’m wrong.</p>

As for your comment about overwriting textures in every other area, you obviously have no idea what you’re talking about. A simple edit of the flo.dat(floor) file in the cache can do exactly what you’re doing. All you have to do is find the tile that you’re interested in editing, change the texture id of that tile and boom, you’re done. As asshole_rule said</p>

<p>And also, you’re using a program to do this. More than likely you have no idea of the inner workings of the cache, nor how it’s read from/written to. This thread would be the equivalent of me typing up a Word document using different fonts/colors etc, and asking the community how I did.</p>

<p>I’m not loading textures from the server, thats what he wanted me to do. Now if your dumbass could read correctly before you post stupid shit maybe you would sound smart. Obviously you have no idea why I made this thread, and I asked how I did I didn’t ask for some dumbass remark telling me its not hard to do. I know its not a hard thing to do, that wasn’t the fucking point. Now if you’d excuse me I’m going to work on my server base and then show my development, maybe then you dumbasses wouldn’t post a dumb reply saying this isn’t hard.<br>

<p>You obviously lack the mental capacity to realize when you’re wrong.</p>
<p>Also, I believe this belongs in the Client Development Section.[/quote]</p>
<p>LOL, you need to get your head checked kid. Also, the client development section only has client help, and client hacking, and last time I posted something like this in client development everyone told me it was the wrong place to post this type of thread. So go fuck yourself.</p>

<p>rofl zyle said nothing in his post about loading a texture through the server, it is you who needs to read more carefully.</p>
<p>and btw, stuff like this was accomplished 3 or more years ago, so i dont see what the  importance of this is.</p>
