    <title>What do you expect from a webshop?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-expect-from-a-webshop/239626</link>
    <description>I like doing business and I want to have my own company when I am older and have more money. But I was thinking, a webshop selling computer parts doesn&#39;t require the owner to have that much money. €3000 to €4000 should be enough to start with. But then I was thinking about the things I expect from a webshop, and made a small list (in order of importance, to me):

1. Be able to return the products without much hassle.
2. Cheap.
3. Fast delivery.
4. Regular updates about the progress of my order.

As you see, that isn&#39;t really a huge list. This mostly comes from the fact that I don&#39;t have much experience buying from webshops, and the experiences I had were all quite positive. So I ask you guys: what do you expect when you buy from a webshop. And please be specific, don&#39;t  say service, but good RMA policy&#39;s etc..

I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll ever start this shop, I&#39;m just making a company plan and maby find a good profit margin to be a competitive company. If it turns out that it will be profitable enough, I&#39;ll probably start it.

So anyways, thanks in advance.</description>
