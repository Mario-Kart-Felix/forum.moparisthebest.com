    <description>Hi,

Im Arthal and I&#39;m new to the community. Im completely new to Java and I need some help. When I go back to school (which is a boarding school) I will not be able to play on private servers but most of my friends there play RS as well and I want to have a private server so we can play.

Ok so I have a server which is a source of Deltascape when they had the home at Fally. I want to know how to make my self an admin account on the server so I can spawn things and make the server more fun for me and my friends. I know how to edit the NPC Drops and all that because there are files in which you just type in the ID and it will make them drop it so thats no problem.

All I want to know is the following: How to manage accounts (make admins, gms, etc), get a few commands for the server because I don&#39;t really know them well and also get some ID&#39;s for Items and NPCs.

Here is the link to the source if you would like it or if it would make it easier for you to help me  :)

Thank you very much for you&#39;re time and hope you can help me ;)</description>
