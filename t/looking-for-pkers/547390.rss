    <title>Looking for PKers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-pkers/547390</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, quick opportunity here.

I am looking for someone who can spice up PKing on a server with a fairly new PKing community so that the Wilderness becomes active, PKing is common, people are wanting to fight, etc. This does include getting PKers towards the server, as we need to build a community. So basicly, I am looking for someone who can bring in a PKing audience and get PvP active. We have plenty of unique features on our PKing server and are expanding every day.

 If you are interested, please message me back or skype me: mabrox97. Thanks!</description>
