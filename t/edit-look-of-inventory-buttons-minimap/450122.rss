    <title>Edit look of inventory buttons &amp; minimap</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/edit-look-of-inventory-buttons-minimap/450122</link>
    <description>I have been researching on the internet for a couple days trying to figure out how to change the inventory screen.  When i say this i mean the buttons the look of the minimap i am just talking about the asthetics of them.  Could someone tell me about how i would go about doing that..  And if this is a hard task or not.  Thank you

I don’t, sorry. I’ve never encountered that problem. You said you were using Delta so download a 317 deob with 377 cache. That has the old gameframe. If you hardcoded any items or sprites just re-add them. That’s all I can say to help.</p>

              <p>Oh I see now. You want to change the look of your gameframe. I’m not sure how to add orbs myself, but there are tutorials on adding orbs. As for the tab sprites find a sprite dump and replace yours.</p>

              <p>If you mean the picture of how it looks then download a program called Toms Cache Editor. After you download that load your client’s cache into it. Then click View/Edit image archives. Then select Media. Then find which sprite you want to edit. After that, export the sprite. Save it as a .png, and then edit it to how you want. The pink (if there is any) is to make that part transparent, so if there is any don’t remove it. After you edit it, import the edited image that HAS to be a .png it should but done. Then click save archive and run your client.</p>
