    <description>Ok, Most servers these days are coming with a World and Region Class. Why are they there? Ever since I implemented that system the same way all the other servers are, I can&#39;t access an areas. For example, tutorial island, any rc altars, etc.

EDIT: Ok I fixed it. In the attempts to search for a specific object loaded onto the map, The System.out.println&#39;s must have slowed down that process and prevented the map region from loading correctly.


I would Still like to know why people made 2 whole new classes, to replace wat was(to the best of my knowledge) working erfectly fine.</description>
