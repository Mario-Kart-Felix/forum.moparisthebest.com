    <title>Looking for a web developer for a currently unnamed project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-web-developer-for-a-currently-unnamed-project/409028</link>
    <description>Hi, I am working on a RSPS with another member of the forums (idk if they wan&#39;t named as of right now) and we&#39;re looking for a web developer.  Now, I don&#39;t want someone to make webclients, set up forums, and stuff like that.  We can do that ourselves.  What we&#39;re looking for is someone competent enough with PHP/MySQL/SMF to be able to write (and possibly maintain) a mod for SMF that includes the following:

[ul][li]Server account creation[/li]
[li]Highscores[/li]
[li]Server administration from the SMF administration panel (ability to edit NPC spawns, item spawns, etc)[/li]
[li]Server moderating from the websites (ability for mods to be able to mute, and ban from the website).[/li][/ul]

We might end up asking you to develop more as the project progresses.

We are looking for people with experience in web development.  We want someone who is able to do this in an efficient and secure way.  If you know very little about web development, please, don&#39;t even bother replying.

Thanks.</description>
