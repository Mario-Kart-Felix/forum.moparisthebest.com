    <title>$Paying$ Need Hi-Quality Lumbridge Castle String Spinner $Paying$</title>

    <description>$$ Paying 3m for the following $$

Uses bank on top and spinning wheel in middle, full anti-random, as anti-ban as possible, as human as possible, makes mistakes but not too often, good mouse movements, takes breaks at random times.  Most importantly fully-working.  Auto responses to players saying part of your name optional.  If you can think to add any more just add it.  Would probably work best in low quality I suppose.

* For this high quality script I will pay 3m geepeez after I get confirmation it is working (how we go about doing that is up to you - a snippet of source-code or a video of it working.)

* After I&#39;ve bought it you provide support if it&#39;s ever broken by graphical updates and the like.  

* If you decide to make it public and free that is fine, but please wait at least 1 or 2 months before releasing it freely.  If you feel like charging for it then release it as soon as you want.  =)

* I agree to never release this script without permission nor charge for it as if it were my own on any forums or privately.

* The source code remains the intellectual property of the owner and I may make no claims of ownership of the code.

* If you need a member&#39;s pin I will provide that for you but pay only 2m - only to the community members at large whom I trust.

* If you&#39;re interested in taking on this task please post here with an estimate of how long it will take you.

Thanks for reading this post and good luck to whomever decides to take this job.</description>
