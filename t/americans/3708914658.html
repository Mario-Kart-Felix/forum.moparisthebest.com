If you look around for long enough, and then compile a list of those with stupid answers, delete all the ones that managed to answer correctly and you‚Äôll get similar results.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt find people to be stupid when I went to America. Now, in general - for some reason, people don‚Äôt seem to be as well traveled as people from Europe, New Zealand and Australia, but they mostly weren‚Äôt stupid people.</p>
<p>I like to poke fun at things like American cars, and other things from American culture, but the American hate on this forum is getting a little extreme, and kind of undermines any debate that starts up with the US being the main topic, which is a shame.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That‚Äôs right.  I‚Äôve often watched stuff like this and have no idea where they find these people, I‚Äôve met stupid people in my life, but never this many or with this level of stupidity.  I half suspect that some of these people are being stupid on purpose, just to get on TV or something.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know about your comment about traveling, it depends on how you look at it.  I would say Americans generally don‚Äôt travel to other countries as much as Europeans, but that‚Äôs probably due to America being HUGE compared to all the tiny countries in Europe.  For example, a few years ago my brother and I went on a road trip to the Grand Canyon and drove 4044 miles in a week, which is 2022 miles one way, you couldn‚Äôt drive that far in England ever without hitting water.  I view Europe‚Äôs nations as similar to America‚Äôs states.  There are 50 of them and I can point them all out on a map, in grade school geography we learned all the countries in Europe too, and I‚Äôm sure I can point out a fair share of them, but certainly not all, and I bet Europeans couldn‚Äôt point out all of our states either.  Doesn‚Äôt make either one of us stupid, we just live in different regions.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll be the first to admit that America and therefore Americans, aren‚Äôt perfect.  But no country or people are, nor have they ever been or ever will be.  America does a lot of stuff right, and a lot of stuff wrong that needs changed, but this is always the case.  I‚Äôm very proud to be an American, proud of my countries history and proud to be free.  I think maybe this feeling is stronger in America than some other countries because we are a relatively new country, our recent ancestors CHOSE to come here, fought for and created this America.  If you live in most of Europe, chances are your family has been there for countless generations, and has chosen to stay there for one reason or another, being more complacent with your government would therefore be in your blood.  Americans don‚Äôt like taxes, and are continually and always suspicious of government and don‚Äôt want government to expand it‚Äôs powers, which I believe is a good way to be.  Taxes and too much government control (including control over religion) are basically the only reason we separated from Britain, so obviously we still disagree on these types of things.</p>
<p>Religion is another difference, most European countries at one point in their history had a state religion.  France Catholics, England Church of England, etc etc.  America was founded on freedom of religion, in fact quite a few founding states of the union were founded simply because they couldn‚Äôt practice their religion in England.  I‚Äôm a practicing Catholic who believes in God, but if you aren‚Äôt I also support that, just as it‚Äôs my right to worship as I see fit, it‚Äôs also yours to worship or not.  Don‚Äôt force your views on me, and I won‚Äôt force mine on you.</p>
<p>Lastly, rights.  Again this is based on how and why America was formed, by people who felt their rights were being trampled on by foreign governments.  We may have a lot of fat people here, but that is because those people CHOOSE to be that way, and our government doesn‚Äôt mandate what we can and can‚Äôt eat (Australia).  From the same freedom a lot of people CHOOSE to be skinny, again, government shouldn‚Äôt intervene.  Some people here choose to play violent video games, or watch movies everyone may not find appropriate, and it‚Äôs not the governments place to tell them they can or can‚Äôt (Australia again).  Some choose to back up the right to defend themselves with the means to defend themselves, guns, and then others choose not to (England, Australia).  Some choose to complain loudly about the government, hold protests, assemblies, and start blogs and forums, that is their right too (China).</p>
<p>To each their own.  That would be a good motto for America.  That was a long post, but it needed to be said, I feel I‚Äôve explained myself fairly well.[/quote]</p>
<p>You know, i love how Europe picks at us because we do everything different (which to them means we aren‚Äôt doing it right, heh). I think they forget that this country was created to be different than the rest. But now people are trying to change it to be more like Europe which starts the whole conservative-liberal debate etc. And is a prime reason American conservatives are seen as idiots and against anything ‚Äògood‚Äô.</p>

<p>Toys in happy meals were banned in San Francisco, you only get the toy if you get fruit and milk etc. McDonalds complained because it should be peoples choice. Are you aware of all the changes McDonalds has done in the past few years? Theyve changed alot of stuff because IIRC the FDA told them they need to get to a certain degree of health by 2015.</p>

<p>To do the bare minimum required of a government.  Provide security (police, army, fire departments etc), and maintain infrastructure (roads, bridges etc).  Maybe I missed a thing or two, but it‚Äôs late and that‚Äôs all that immediately comes to mind.</p>

<p>To do the bare minimum required of a government.  Provide security (police, army, fire departments etc), and maintain infrastructure (roads, bridges etc).  Maybe I missed a thing or two, but it‚Äôs late and that‚Äôs all that immediately comes to mind.[/quote]Ok, infrastructure, got it! But security? Considering your earlier posts about gun control, you provide your own ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù, and the police is just an oppressive force?</p>

<p>Moparisthebest makes a fantastic post, and you come in and say something like that. I really do sometimes wonder if you know the history of your own country Frell.

<p>Your country was founded by free europeans looking for a better world. As MITB said, freedom of religion being one of the aims. So I come to my final point, why do europeans throw the hate and say you do things wrong? Because of what happened. What your country became, instead of what it could have become. It‚Äôs annoying, and it‚Äôs not you or your generations fault but you don‚Äôt do anything to fix it so many hold you just as accountable as previous generations.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want America more like Europe. You‚Äôre the last remaining superpower. I expect you to be the forefront of mankind. The people who should say ‚Äúthe world is wrong‚Äù, and try to change it. Corporate influence over diplomatic discussions ruins that. There‚Äôs my beef (I think you American‚Äôs say).</p>
<p>The thing to understand is, I think my own country does things in a stupid way but we tell ourselves and each other. The British all hate out government anyway, whereas American‚Äôs often show support for theirs, and generally towards anything America is doing (isn‚Äôt there a patriot‚Äôs act or something? I‚Äôm not well read up that). People hate arrogance, people dislike those who feel big about themselves, and America feels big about itself. It‚Äôs your biggest downfall, the inability to accept that you <em>could</em> be wrong (as a nation in general, not as individuals).</p>
<p>Again, I‚Äôm trying to avoid stereotyping or generalising but it‚Äôs incredibly difficult and kind of pointless, because I have nothing against those who don‚Äôt fit the stereotypes. It‚Äôs just those that do that are so goddamned annoying and fuel these Europe hates America flame wars. <em>cough</em> Frell <em>cough</em></p>

Actually agreed with your post, and alot of people here are very arrogant. What i meant by mine, for instance, would be like the healthcare bill. People think the ones against it here just hate to help people etc. Its little stuff like that that keeps the bickering. Basically im saying we were built to be different, so why make comments about how we do everything different? And yes our country does alot of things wrong, but we have never discussed anything other than wars here. And the main problem with that is when people think we go skipping around starting wars everywhere, and of course in reality we aren‚Äôt. Even though it seems like it.</p>

Every citizen has 2 governments pretty much. Our federal government <span class="bbcode-b">should</span> only do 4 things, none which affect any of us directly. But over the years, shit like social security, welfare, etc has stockpiled into our budget. Our state governments are supposed to be doing everything else, but its slowly being flipped around and people are becoming more angry.</p>
