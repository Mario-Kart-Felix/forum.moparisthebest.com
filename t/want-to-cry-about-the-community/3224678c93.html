<p>Continuing on, honestly there was no valid point to lock my topic. It was either a.) because it was flamed to hell by senseless people which can easily be removed or b.) you personally didn’t like the thread because it was “terrible” by your terms. There were no rules being broken in that topic. I never leeched a topic, I never lied about anything, I never started the flame war, nor did I retaliate, I never bull shitted through it without thoroughly explaining it. So technically, it shouldn’t be locked. And the funny thing is, you yet haven’t given me a valid point as to why you locked it in the four hours it’s been locked. You avoided my post on the topic provided above, and you’re failing to understand the reasons for the being of my client because you were probably blinded by all of the bull shit Cocoa brought into my topic. Now, do I seem like that type of person who’s going to make 50 “I hate the staff” topics and drop f bombs everywhere, or do I seem like the type of person who would like to talk it out rationally and maturely, but seems to be deprived of that right because of the avoidance you’re creating?<br>

<p>I Toatally agree and also: All you stupid ass mods who lock topics for fun are ruining this community just because some people Didn’t Like someones work dont mean they have to talk shit about it and  shitty mod has to lock it hmm i wonder what this pic says:</p>

<p>Topics that are bound to end up into childish banter need to be locked before any idiot can derail it.</p>
<p>eg. that “whos gay” thread. It was bound to end up into a pile of shit and imo should have been locked as quickly as possible. People don’t need to publicize their sexuality; this being the internet people are never going to be 100% honest.<br>

<p>Then you have the moparscape staff, who do nothing anymore, just the very few and come on and think this is all so fun and games.</p>
<p>This is starting to be bull shit.</p>
<p>You wonder why MoparScape is getting less popular, it is because of bullshit stuff like this that happens.[/quote]<br>
The reason it was locked it because there is a stickied thread for retarded posts like that. You don’t need to make a new thread for it.</p>

        <p>@ BlacknRaven &amp; runefreak, You should shut up because we’re not flaming and putting you down for no reason -.- . &amp;&amp; you obviously think we’re stuck up because of a number. I guess I’ll have to explain this and jump onto the “rep is just a number” train. What you’re saying is true, yes, but not all people become stuck up because of reputation points. You’re mad because 3 people told you that your client wasn’t all that you thought it was. &lt;&lt; That’s directed at runefreak10<br>
As for BlacknRaven, I don’t know who you are or what your problem is but I’ve definitely never even talked to you, so how can you say that I’m stuck up. Also, @ both of you, insulting moderators is not going to get you anywhere except banned. Which you will then proceed to crying about how you’re sorry etc etc.</p>

<p>Are you fucking retarded or something? Like honesty. When the hell did I bring reputation points into this? Spades was talking about all of that, not me. I didn’t get mad because 3 people didn’t like my topic, I got mad because you were failing to understand the concept of my fucking client and you kept going on about how it was pointless because all I did was remove shit and all I needed to do was get a deob. Like I said, your opinions don’t matter more over anyone else’s, so do you think I went in a room and cried because 3 people decided to make stupid, senseless posts on my topic? Hell no. I tried multiple times to calmly explain to you what the point of it was but you were too busy being all damn high and mighty calling it shit to even stop for a second to read my posts. As for your comment about accusing me of insulting the moderators, you’re just putting shit you want to hear in your own head at this point. When the hell did I directly insult and attack a moderator? That was Spades and Blacknraven, which I don’t even know who the hell he is, but if you think it was me doing it, then supply the post. God damn. You’re part of the whole thing and don’t even know the fucking facts.</p>

@ BlacknRaven &amp; runefreak, You should shut up because we’re not flaming and putting you down for no reason -.- . &amp;&amp; you obviously think we’re stuck up because of a number. I guess I’ll have to explain this and jump onto the “rep is just a number” train. What you’re saying is true, yes, but not all people become stuck up because of reputation points. You’re mad because 3 people told you that your client wasn’t all that you thought it was. &lt;&lt; That’s directed at runefreak10<br>
As for BlacknRaven, I don’t know who you are or what your problem is but I’ve definitely never even talked to you, so how can you say that I’m stuck up. Also, @ both of you, insulting moderators is not going to get you anywhere except banned. Which you will then proceed to crying about how you’re sorry etc etc.<br>

<p>Are you fucking retarded or something? Like honesty. When the hell did I bring reputation points into this? Spades was talking about all of that, not me. I didn’t get mad because 3 people didn’t like my topic, I got mad because you were failing to understand the concept of my fucking client and you kept going on about how it was pointless because all I did was … [/quote]</p>

<p>I was trying to explain to her what she did was corrupt and her reasons for locking my topic were asinine.  I was asking her to explain to me what she meant exactly because she seemed to be failing to understand my topic. After I try explaining it to her why she’s wrong, she goes on and locks the topic and says “use the cry thread to cry plz.” I understand that wasn’t the place to post it, but the idea was to get the point across to her. She seemed to use the lock as a last word sort of thing because she had posted on that topic once before locking it. Anyways, I go to the complaint board as directed and she completely fucking ignores all of my posts there too, but yet she felt compelled enough to reply to a post from back in the beginning of January? The only reason she replied to it was probably to show me that she was reading all of my posts, and basically fucking ignoring them because she knows I’m right. So she directs me to this board, having me figure that we would discuss it on here, then to find out that she is only going to fucking ignore me? No, you don’t do that shit.</p>

The people with 200 rep don’t just magically get it. They do things to help the forum, unlike any of you. I admit, there have been many idiots/faggots with 200 rep.

I’m here to complain about the number of members on this forum that believe once you’ve reached 200 rep, you’re pended to the asshole list.</p>
<p>Since I’ve been here, I’ve been the same user and person. I’ve been a 200 rep member with an incredible amount of dedication to the Help section, and a 200 rep member without dedication to the help section. With that said, I’ve generously went above and beyond expectations concerning RSPS support for other members and held my respect for every member. I’ve never used my reputation to get away with an offense, nor would the moderators allow me to do so. There is no connection with reputation and some form of shield from demerit. Everyone needs to stop putting high-rep members on a pedestal, because in all honesty, you’re the ones that put them there. Half of them, in my point of view, don’t even deserve the rep amount they have anyways. Next time you judge someone based on their rep, get to know them better and maybe you’ll have a change of thought.<br>

Hey dickface, I’m not done. I’m very much aware that was aimed at me. Keep your mouth shut unless you actually know who I am and my actual level of stupidity etc.</p>
