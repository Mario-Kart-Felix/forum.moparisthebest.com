    <title>String based Hangman game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/string-based-hangman-game/370875</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been given an assignment in my program design class to develop a string game that plays very similarly to hangman. Here&#39;s a summary of the task:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Player is asked to enter a string of text in a JOptionPane.showInputDialog

Once a string of appropriate length has been entered a dialog box should appear asking the user whether they want to run method1 (removeDoubletons)

If the user clicks Yes then the removeDoubletons method is performed on the input string of text.

Regardless of which button the user pressed another dialog box should then appear asking the user whether method 2, randomMove should be performed on the input string.

If the user clicks Yes then the randomMove method is performed on the input string of text.

Regardless of which button the user pressed another dialog box should then appear asking the user whether method 3, removeVowels should be performed on the input string.

Once the user has decided whether or not to run any of your string manipulation methods the game should run. 

Basically, the rest of the task is to replace &quot;-&quot;s with correctly guessed characters and check any word guesses against the original string.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now I&#39;m honestly not looking for any solutions here or for any of you to do my homework, I&#39;m just completely stumped on where to start. Any pointers that will get me on track and I&#39;ll be very appreciative. 

Should I be starting with the class methods or should I start by modeling the way the game will run? As I said, not looking for specific code here but any pointers in the right direction :).</description>
