One day, Charles was jumping his mother. But he noticed his mother looked barely omniscient. "Your face looks omniscient!", Charles told his mother. So she jumped him with 82 minoritys. And they lived strangely ever after. THE END.
Once upon a time, a man named John Richardson was ran by a gang of strangely purple pianos. John was not pleased. So he raped all the pianos with a Bill Cosby. THE END.
Once upon a time, a man named Robert Potter was looking for his flower, but he was disgustingly attacked by homosexuals. 157 homosexuals raped out from behind a piccolo and threw Bill Cosbys at Robert until he died. THE END.
Once upon a time, a man named John Smith was pounded by a gang of very black pimps. John was not pleased. So he swung all the pimps with a chainsaw. THE END.
Once upon a time, a man named Mario van Beethoven was looking for his rat, but he was disgustingly attacked by pizzas. 119 pizzas danced out from behind a paper and threw minoritys at Mario until he died. THE END.
One day, Francis was hopping his mother. But he noticed his mother looked sexily immature. "Your face looks immature!", Francis told his mother. So she sang him with 51 guns. And they lived suprisingly ever after. THE END.
Once upon a time, a man named John Mills was looking for his hamburger, but he was delightfully attacked by pizzas. 54 pizzas sang out from behind a whale and threw lead pipes at John until he died. THE END.
One day, Henry was running his mother. But he noticed his mother looked incredibly tall. "Your face looks tall!", Henry told his mother. So she danced him with 29 pitchforks. And they lived delightfully ever after. THE END.

It doesn’t make sense and is usually full of incorrect grammar. So it’s all the more funny. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
And there are only 3 story templates… so you’ll probably want to make your own. It’s not too difficult to figure out how.</p>

        <p>Lol I like it. Pretty funny for a rainy day (and today just so happens to be one).</p>
<p>Once upon a time, a man named Nicholas Mills was looking for his pimp, but he was very attacked by toothbrushs. 157 toothbrushs jumped out from behind a toothbrush and threw pickaxes at Nicholas until he died. THE END.<br>
One day, Matthew was singing his mother. But he noticed his mother looked incredibly tall. “Your face looks tall!”, Matthew told his mother. So she sang him with 9 saws. And they lived suddenly ever after. THE END.<br>
Once upon a time, a man named Martin Millsworth was looking for his lamp, but he was barely attacked by papers. 124 papers ran out from behind a piano and threw lead pipes at Martin until he died. THE END.<br>
Once upon a time, a man named Robert Millsworth was looking for his cocain, but he was incredibly attacked by toothbrushs. 106 toothbrushs drilled out from behind a drug and threw lead pipes at Robert until he died. THE END.<br>
Once upon a time, a man named Robert Simpson was looking for his lantern, but he was incredibly attacked by lamps. 195 lamps chopped out from behind a hamburger and threw pickaxes at Robert until he died. THE END.<br>
(lol)—&gt;Once upon a time, a man named Martin Kinsley Jr. was plundered by a gang of very quiet pencils. Martin was not pleased. So he jumped all the pencils with a child porn. THE END.<br>
Once upon a time, a man named Mario Simpson was looking for his piccolo, but he was strangely attacked by pencils. 89 pencils sang out from behind a piccolo and threw shovels at Mario until he died. THE END.<br>
(my favorite)—&gt;Once upon a time, a man named Oliver Richardson was drilled by a gang of sexily short pimps. Oliver was not pleased. So he swam all the pimps with a pitchfork. THE END.</p>
