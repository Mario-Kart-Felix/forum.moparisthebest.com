One day, Charles was jumping his mother. But he noticed his mother looked barely omniscient. &quot;Your face looks omniscient!&quot;, Charles told his mother. So she jumped him with 82 minoritys. And they lived strangely ever after. THE END.
Once upon a time, a man named John Richardson was ran by a gang of strangely purple pianos. John was not pleased. So he raped all the pianos with a Bill Cosby. THE END.
Once upon a time, a man named Robert Potter was looking for his flower, but he was disgustingly attacked by homosexuals. 157 homosexuals raped out from behind a piccolo and threw Bill Cosbys at Robert until he died. THE END.
Once upon a time, a man named John Smith was pounded by a gang of very black pimps. John was not pleased. So he swung all the pimps with a chainsaw. THE END.

Once upon a time, a man named John Mills was looking for his hamburger, but he was delightfully attacked by pizzas. 54 pizzas sang out from behind a whale and threw lead pipes at John until he died. THE END.
One day, Henry was running his mother. But he noticed his mother looked incredibly tall. &quot;Your face looks tall!&quot;, Henry told his mother. So she danced him with 29 pitchforks. And they lived delightfully ever after. THE END.
Once upon a time, a man named Stephen Richardson was ran by a gang of strangely immature bees. Stephen was not pleased. So he ran all the bees with a minority. THE END.
Once upon a time, a man named Steven Humphrey was looking for his bee, but he was oddly attacked by kangaroos. 46 kangaroos murdered out from behind a toothbrush and threw lead pipes at Steven until he died. THE END.

It doesn&#39;t make sense and is usually full of incorrect grammar. So it&#39;s all the more funny. :D
And there are only 3 story templates... so you&#39;ll probably want to make your own. It&#39;s not too difficult to figure out how.</description>
