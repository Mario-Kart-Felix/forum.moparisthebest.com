    <description>I&#39;m sure plenty of you remember my old Range/Melee pure. Well, I sold that account ages ago for nearly $250. I&#39;ve had this small account though, for awhile I&#39;d suppose, but I had lost interest in the game after losing everything so many times. Well, I realized that I wanted to not only try out the new skills, but I enjoy being a member of the game much more than I enjoy being a non-member. I figured I would ask, is it still worth it to buy membership? Is the newer skill &#39;Summoning&#39; a good one? If I ultimately choose to make myself a member, should I wait and train this account or just go ahead and buy it?

<p>I’m wondering. Seeing as I wont be spending any time out in Bounty Hunter, should I just kind of not stay completly pure? I like being Ranged pure, but it’s so limited. I was thinking about adding another combat skill, but I’m not sure to which one.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ranging is sooooo strong it is not even funny. 10 dragon arrows + dark bow + 90+ ranged = almost unbeatable ranger. Don’t forget to do animal magnetism as well.</p>

              <p>Summoning is a blowout imo. You make pouches with spirit shards, charms, some original item of the creature, and obelisks. You then make attack scrolls using pouches. You drain summoning points when summoning a creature and can only have that creature out for a small amount of time. These creatures only have a few special attacks (which means only a few scrolls to use up) during their time duration. On top of all that, you can only summon in multicombat areas. The summoning creatures have okay effects but the combat ones practically suck. The experience is good. The familiars are a bit of a blowout, but are okay.</p>
<p>It is a bit disappointing to see such hype built up on a skill that is a bit random and abstract compared to what you would think summoning would be like.</p>
<p>Also, the charms you used are monster drops and take a while to get (if you want to get to a decent level).</p>
