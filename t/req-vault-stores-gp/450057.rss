    <title>[REQ] Vault (stores GP)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-vault-stores-gp/450057</link>
    <description>So I was on SS today and I saw that they had implemented an additional button in the bank tab. I am not completely sure of its uses, other than storing over 2147M in your bank.  Anyone know how this could be done? Would it be similarly coded as to Bob is bob&#39;s tutorial on the Money Bag?</description>

<p>all that you really need to do is add a button to the bank interface, have it open the same thing as you would if you did “bank x”, input the amount, and save it as a long instead of an int</p>
<p>also, if you know what you’re doing (as this would take both client and server sided edits) you can convert the amount of items you can have to a long, thus getting rid of the need for a vault</p>
