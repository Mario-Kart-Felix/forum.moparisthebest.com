    <title>Coder needed. (Good coder, and knows what they are doing.)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/coder-needed-good-coder-and-knows-what-they-are-doing/136284</link>
    <description>REWARDS: Having a 90% credit put up on sever, Co-Owner of sever, making a kick a$$ sever, and being drowned in thanks by me. AND BEING LOVED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE SEVER.

REQUIREMENTS: YOU must download a sever that you are best at coding. You need to be skilled in coding,and have little knowloadge of java etc. You must not get fustrated easily and give up, and you need a good attitude.

Add hamachi sever: RamScape pass: 123.

First person who PM&#39;s me is the coder, rest, just wait for an awesome sever :D</description>

<p>You need little or no Java ability to code private servers.</p>
