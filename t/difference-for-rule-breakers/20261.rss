    <title>Difference for rule breakers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/difference-for-rule-breakers/20261</link>
    <description>I was just thinking that why not have different punishments for different rules being broken,
like i was thinking if people talk about rep then they should have points taken from their rep (yes feel free to take rep from me)

And spam = being unable to post + make posts + send pm&#39;s, but they can still use the site.
Multiple spamming from different accounts = ban from the site.

and so on...
just wanted to say that this would actually maybe give mods + admins a job, instead of just clicking the ban button....
meh discuss please!

edit:- sorry may have put this in wrong section.</description>

              <p>Now, this may not make perfect sense and typing is really hard because I’ve had a few too many, but:</p>
<p>There are two different types of laws. You have the letter of the law, and the spirit of the law. The letter of the law is simply the written set of rules and their punishments. The problem with the letter of the law is that if you followed it exactly, then just from poking somebody they could sue you for assaulting them, because the letter of the law states that if you touch them without their consent then you are assaulting them. This rule was not written so that people could go around abusing it by charging people for getting touched at all, etc. That is why we have the spirit of the law.</p>
<p>The spirit of the law is what we really decide on punishments depending on the situation. Basically, it is the un-written set of rules that uses a whole lot of common sense. This way, if you poked someone they could not have you charged for assult, unless you were to cause bodily harm to them. This also lets the judge be a little more flexible on the punishment, depending on what exactly the crime was and how serious the offense was. Hopefully that makes sense.</p>
<p>So, what does that have to do with this? Well basically, if it was made so that every time someone mentioned the word “rep” and had something like 3 points taken away, then in so many situations it would not be fair or right. There should never be a complete set no-matter-what punishment, it should just be looked upon by a mod and let him decide the punishment. If it is worth punishing them, then they will look how serious the offense was and they will take it from there.</p>
<p>Oh yeah I can really tell I’m going into my proffessor stage. Everytime I’m just a little bit drunk I always talk this way. Damn cops got to the party a little earlier then when they normally show up at.</p>
