    <title>A few easy quests for added security</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-easy-quests-for-added-security/2468</link>
    <description>When jagex looks at a lvl 3 with 40 mining, no other skillz and only rune mysteries done they of course get the idea to insta-ban forever. Why not script a few of the reallly easy lumby quests ( sheap shearer and cooks assistant ) to go along with rune mysteries. also on tut island mabey the noober should complete every skill to lvl 3? it would only take about twice as long but will make up in time not having to create countless noobs to replace banees. why i&#39;m asking this here is because i suck at programming, i&#39;m a noob. does anyone think this would help? or just be a waste of time.</description>

              <p>Probably just be a waste of time ay. I dont really think Jagex takes levels and quests into much consideration when banning. They see weird mouse movements\characters trying to eat their own arms --- they ban.</p>
