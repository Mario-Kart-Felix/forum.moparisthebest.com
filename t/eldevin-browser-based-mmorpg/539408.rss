    <title>Eldevin - Browser based MMORPG</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eldevin-browser-based-mmorpg/539408</link>
    <description>Hello! :)

Has anyone tried Eldevin? It is a browser mmorpg just like Runescape and was released recently. 

I have started playing it today, and so far I must say that I really enjoy crafting as it resembles a lot like Runescape and Ashen Empires. Graphics are quite good considering that it runs on browser. There seems to be quite a bit professions and they have been implemented nicely, such as Forestry, Farming and Foraging for example. There is many steps to each profession which is nice, you can&#39;t just throw seed on the ground and boom it grows to a tree. :P You have to prepare the land, put the seed, water it and keep the land healthy (in case of plant diseases), maybe more water and harvest. After that you might use that new ingredient you got by farming to something else, like cooking.

Gameplay Info:[/B]

[I]Eldevin is a browser-based MMORPG featuring a rich storyline and hundreds of quests. The decisions you make carry through to later areas, influencing what encounters you will receive, giving the game a very dynamic feel to its play. The world is large, with dungeons to delve, secrets to discover, and towns to visit. Choose from over 100 different skills, and enjoy a classless leveling system where you can develop however you choose.

Eldevin gives you the option to level your character however you’d like. There are six talent trees with over 200 talents, and over 100 abilities to learn. Craft your own weapons, armor, and items through the extensive crafting system. The world is very large, and you can explore wherever you like. Secrets and dungeons are waiting to be discovered across the land. Combat is real-time, and skill and strategy must be used to take down tougher monsters.

There are six character classes in Eldevin. Unlike many other games, there are no restrictions to equipping items or armor. So if you want your Mage to wield a 2 handed sword, you can. Also there are few restrictions in using talents and abilities. So a Warrior can cast a fireball if he wants to. Although he won&#39;t be as powerful as a Mage casting a fireball, he can still do it. This gives you options regarding your style of gameplay.
The classes

    Warrior: (Melee Damage) Allows you to take down multiple targets.
    Templar: (Tank) This class can draw enemies and take their damage.
    Assassin: (Melee Damage) Mastery of quick damage and damage over time.
    Ranger: (Ranged Damage) Specializes in shooting with bows with powerful abilities.
    Mage: (Spell Damage) Can use powerful magical spells to deal large amounts of damage.
    Prophet: (Healer) Heals your allies with powerful spells.

I have heard people say this is modernized Runescape, however still much different from Runescape. I recommend you try it out if you like crafting in mmorpg and browser mmorpgs :) I&#39;d say it rivals Runescape quite well.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Uncalled, post:8, topic:539408”]Yes. I’ve played for a little bit, have completed a few starter quests, got to a “decent” level (about 7-8, I can’t remember). I must say that I do enjoy their combat system. It seems to be faster-paced than most games, which is enjoyable. However, I can’t say anything for the pvp aspect, I never got the chance to give it a try. So I won’t be able to comment on their balance with the characters, classes, etc. Though, player vs monster seems to be quite easy from what I played. Maybe a bit too easy. Throughout the entire time of killing monsters and doing all my quests, I never once dropped below 98% of my health points. The monsters deal about 2-11 damage per hit (on a mage-type) out of your 300-400 health. And that is if they could even reach me. If they did, they would be dead within the next attack. I wish that it had a difficulty more of that is in WoW. I could also not, for the life of me, find where to buy any more advanced weapons for magic users. Or armor, at that matter. I kind of figured that the leather armor vendor would suffice enough. I also was unable to find where to learn more skills, I figured that they would be quest rewards, as that’s how I attained all my last ‘scrolls’. The animations for everything seems to be a bit choppy as well. I had also received a bit of lag spikes, could be my internet, though it was more frequent than most games I play on. I never got to see much of the melee perspective, but I saw quite a bit of ranged from other users as I was playing. I believe that the attack speed for bows is a bit fast. Maybe too fast, and should be lowered. Though, I never played on it besides for the ranged tutoring in the beginning quests, so I can’t say much for it. However, I think that either the npc’s health should be raised a bit, or the damage and attack speed of certain aspects should be lowered.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s a decent game, I would recommend you to check it out.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hello! Its just the beginning. I have heard that the last dungeons/zones are quite dangerous and even require some strategy to keep you alive. :9</p>
<p>Also at level 7-10 you start to face more dangerous stuff. I have died couple of times due to being too reckless, thinking that I would faceroll them as I did before. :d</p>
<p>Glad you guys like the game! Meet ya there if you plan to play, because I will. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

              <p>Yes. I’ve played for a little bit, have completed a few starter quests, got to a “decent” level (about 7-8, I can’t remember). I must say that I do enjoy their combat system. It seems to be faster-paced than most games, which is enjoyable. However, I can’t say anything for the pvp aspect, I never got the chance to give it a try. So I won’t be able to comment on their balance with the characters, classes, etc. Though, player vs monster seems to be quite easy from what I played. Maybe a bit too easy. Throughout the entire time of killing monsters and doing all my quests, I never once dropped below 98% of my health points. The monsters deal about 2-11 damage per hit (on a mage-type) out of your 300-400 health. And that is if they could even reach me. If they did, they would be dead within the next attack. I wish that it had a difficulty more of that is in WoW. I could also not, for the life of me, find where to buy any more advanced weapons for magic users. Or armor, at that matter. I kind of figured that the leather armor vendor would suffice enough. I also was unable to find where to learn more skills, I figured that they would be quest rewards, as that’s how I attained all my last ‘scrolls’. The animations for everything seems to be a bit choppy as well. I had also received a bit of lag spikes, could be my internet, though it was more frequent than most games I play on. I never got to see much of the melee perspective, but I saw quite a bit of ranged from other users as I was playing. I believe that the attack speed for bows is a bit fast. Maybe too fast, and should be lowered. Though, I never played on it besides for the ranged tutoring in the beginning quests, so I can’t say much for it. However, I think that either the npc’s health should be raised a bit, or the damage and attack speed of certain aspects should be lowered.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s a decent game, I would recommend you to check it out.</p>

              <p>Hello! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Has anyone tried Eldevin? It is a browser mmorpg just like Runescape and was released recently.</p>
<p>I have started playing it today, and so far I must say that I really enjoy crafting as it resembles a lot like Runescape and Ashen Empires. Graphics are quite good considering that it runs on browser. There seems to be quite a bit professions and they have been implemented nicely, such as Forestry, Farming and Foraging for example. There is many steps to each profession which is nice, you can’t just throw seed on the ground and boom it grows to a tree. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> You have to prepare the land, put the seed, water it and keep the land healthy (in case of plant diseases), maybe more water and harvest. After that you might use that new ingredient you got by farming to something else, like cooking.</p>

Gameplay Info:[/B]</p>
<p>[I]Eldevin is a browser-based MMORPG featuring a rich storyline and hundreds of quests. The decisions you make carry through to later areas, influencing what encounters you will receive, giving the game a very dynamic feel to its play. The world is large, with dungeons to delve, secrets to discover, and towns to visit. Choose from over 100 different skills, and enjoy a classless leveling system where you can develop however you choose.</p>
<p>Eldevin gives you the option to level your character however you’d like. There are six talent trees with over 200 talents, and over 100 abilities to learn. Craft your own weapons, armor, and items through the extensive crafting system. The world is very large, and you can explore wherever you like. Secrets and dungeons are waiting to be discovered across the land. Combat is real-time, and skill and strategy must be used to take down tougher monsters.</p>
<p>There are six character classes in Eldevin. Unlike many other games, there are no restrictions to equipping items or armor. So if you want your Mage to wield a 2 handed sword, you can. Also there are few restrictions in using talents and abilities. So a Warrior can cast a fireball if he wants to. Although he won’t be as powerful as a Mage casting a fireball, he can still do it. This gives you options regarding your style of gameplay.<br>
The classes</p>
<pre><code>Warrior: (Melee Damage) Allows you to take down multiple targets.
Templar: (Tank) This class can draw enemies and take their damage.
Assassin: (Melee Damage) Mastery of quick damage and damage over time.
Ranger: (Ranged Damage) Specializes in shooting with bows with powerful abilities.
Mage: (Spell Damage) Can use powerful magical spells to deal large amounts of damage.
Prophet: (Healer) Heals your allies with powerful spells.
</code></pre>

<p>I have heard people say this is modernized Runescape, however still much different from Runescape. I recommend you try it out if you like crafting in mmorpg and browser mmorpgs <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I’d say it rivals Runescape quite well.</p>
