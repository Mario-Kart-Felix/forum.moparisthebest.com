Note- I did not make Camelot-PvP or Project Insanity. I am just using Project-Insanity as a base and re-creating Camelot-PvP with more features making it even funner to play.

[size=14pt]-Intro-[/size]
Im sure almost every one has heard of the source/server called Camelot-PvP or Crazy-PvP right? Well as time went on it slowly started to fall behind other newer sources that were more updated then Camelot-PvP. So I have decided to revive Camelot-PvP and bring it back to the great Pickup and Pk server it was.

[size=14pt]-Quick Facts-[/size]
Server Base- Project-Insanity (Riotscape)
Client Base- Galkon&#39;s Refractored 459 look a like, loading a 474 cache
Server Type- Spawning (Pickup and Pk)

Adding More Soon

[size=14pt]-In Depth Info-[/size]
I will go into depth on some of the features I have listed above.

-Skillcape Emotes-
Since I was going to use this client and server for my current server then decided not to due to glitchs I had already coded in the Skillcape Emotes. So might as well use them here

-Pk Point Shop-
Instead of having the classic Reward Crate that gave you a random Item I have decided to make a Pk-Point Shop letting you choose what you want to buy.

-Duel Arena-
About 1 year ago when i first got into rsps and used Cammy-PvP as my servers base I was always bugged by my players to code in a Duel Arena. So I decied to keep the current Duel Arena To Let People Have a break and have some fun fights.

-Custom Fighting Zones-
Since I was having trouble coding it so you can only fight people 10 above your level or 10 lower your level I decided to just make custom zones that require You to have done the Command to let you In that area. For Example you would have to Do ::tank to go in the tank Area or ::pure to go in the pure area. That way level 126&#39;s can&#39;t come and kill you.

-Custom Multi-PvP Area-
Since I want to use the party room for another area I decided to code in another area right behind the Camelot bank by the Maple Trees For People to  have team fights. I Plan on Making This Area Bigger.

-No Custom Items-
When I coded my Camelot-PvP Source about 1 year ago I had alot of customs... This lead to people quiting because of over powered weapons making me release the source... That was the biggest mistake I have made so now I no longer have any Customs in any of my servers. So no worrying if that guy with the Energy Sword is gonna 1 hit you...

More In-Depth Info Coming Soon

              <p>[center]<img src="http://img697.imageshack.us/img697/6071/cammynoglow.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Note- I did not make Camelot-PvP or Project Insanity. I am just using Project-Insanity as a base and re-creating Camelot-PvP with more features making it even funner to play.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]-Intro-[/size]<br>
Im sure almost every one has heard of the source/server called Camelot-PvP or Crazy-PvP right? Well as time went on it slowly started to fall behind other newer sources that were more updated then Camelot-PvP. So I have decided to revive Camelot-PvP and bring it back to the great Pickup and Pk server it was.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]-Quick Facts-[/size]<br>
Server Base- Project-Insanity (Riotscape)<br>
Client Base- Galkon’s Refractored 459 look a like, loading a 474 cache<br>

<p>Adding More Soon</p>
<p>[size=14pt]-In Depth Info-[/size]<br>
I will go into depth on some of the features I have listed above.</p>
<p>-Skillcape Emotes-<br>
Since I was going to use this client and server for my current server then decided not to due to glitchs I had already coded in the Skillcape Emotes. So might as well use them here</p>
<p>-Pk Point Shop-<br>
Instead of having the classic Reward Crate that gave you a random Item I have decided to make a Pk-Point Shop letting you choose what you want to buy.</p>
<p>-Duel Arena-<br>
About 1 year ago when i first got into rsps and used Cammy-PvP as my servers base I was always bugged by my players to code in a Duel Arena. So I decied to keep the current Duel Arena To Let People Have a break and have some fun fights.</p>
<p>-Custom Fighting Zones-<br>
Since I was having trouble coding it so you can only fight people 10 above your level or 10 lower your level I decided to just make custom zones that require You to have done the Command to let you In that area. For Example you would have to Do ::tank to go in the tank Area or ::pure to go in the pure area. That way level 126’s can’t come and kill you.</p>
<p>-Custom Multi-PvP Area-<br>
Since I want to use the party room for another area I decided to code in another area right behind the Camelot bank by the Maple Trees For People to  have team fights. I Plan on Making This Area Bigger.</p>
<p>-No Custom Items-<br>
When I coded my Camelot-PvP Source about 1 year ago I had alot of customs… This lead to people quiting because of over powered weapons making me release the source… That was the biggest mistake I have made so now I no longer have any Customs in any of my servers. So no worrying if that guy with the Energy Sword is gonna 1 hit you…</p>
<p>More In-Depth Info Coming Soon</p>
