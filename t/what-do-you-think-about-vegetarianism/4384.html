<p>Me:<br>
I am NOT a vegetarian. In fact, vegans tend to annoy me severely. Some kid was walking around my school trying to get everyone to become vegans. He is lucky I’m nice, or I would have beaten the living crap out of him. Of course, I bet someone else already did. Heres the five main types of vegans:</p>
<p>Nazi Vegans: These idiots try to change everyones mind and make all meat eaters go vegan. Then they get mad when they wont. I personally HATE these ones, and feel like slamming them against a wall.</p>
<p>Psuedo (fake) vegans: These just annoy me. They are the ones who say “Oh I don’t eat meat, but I eat chicken (or fish).” I have nothing to say to these ones. Some of them even get mad at peope who eat beef, etc.</p>
<p>Standard Vegans: I have no problem with these ones. They are vegans, but keep to themselves, and don’t get mad at meat eaters. If a meat eaters question them about it, they also put up a good debate, which I also respect.</p>
<p>Obsessive vegans: The ones who are afraid to step on bugs, or afraid to look at an animal funny in the fear of “scaring” it. They are fun to make fun of.</p>
<p>Hide in a corner Vegans: The ones who are vegan, leave people alone and let them eat meat, but if someone questions them about it, they don’t put up a good debate or support their oppinion. These ones are usually just trying to be the “hero”.</p>
<p>Summary:<br>
I am fine with vegans, but I can’t stand the ones who are obsessive, bossy, or cannot support their opinion. I think animals are meant to be eaten, period. I know that sounds harsh, but I include humans in that too. If we get lost in the woods or general wilderness, we will get eaten. If I lived in the woods and a dear is on my lawn, I would pull out a gun and next thing you know I have dinner, a very good one at that. If you ask me, thats fair. They can kill us, so I WILL kill them. Of course, I wouldn’t hunt for sport, I would eat what I kill.</p>

        <p>Being an Albertan, we are known for our Beef.</p>
<p>Personally, I see no point in being vegan. Studies have been done that Meat may cause some problems, but the replacements Vegans use for meat are just as bad. A lot of the food vegans eat include Soy Bean, which were thoguht to be one of the best sources of nutrition until recently.</p>
<p>I read an article in the Newspaper a couple months ago about a study on “Soy Beans,” however the article is not listed on the archives of the newspapers site, so I cannot supoort my argument fully. I forget what it said for the most part, except that it can cause some kind of disease or something.</p>
<p>I will try to find a link to the article, and post it here.</p>

        <p>first of all being a vegetarian should<br>
never be associated with being<br>
a revolutionary or being open-minded.<br>
that’s a dietary choice.<br>
if someone wants to proliferate the<br>
type of ignorance we’re supposed to<br>
be fighting by thinking that,<br>
you’re just fucking yourself.<br>
i don’t go around promoting<br>
beef and pultry shoving it in<br>
people’s faces.<br>
i don’t castigate people for not<br>
eating steak sandwiches;<br>
and i would never diss someone<br>
for being a fucking broccoli-head,<br>
or living off of radishes,<br>
or eating grass or tofu.<br>
i like a lot of vegan cuisine.<br>
but the illogicality of expecting<br>
everyone to adopt their particular<br>
idea of what being healthy is<br>
is just preposterous.<br>
i’ve seen some of you herbivores;<br>
and if you want to argue health,<br>
y’all need to eat some kind of supplement<br>
because some of y’all are so skinny<br>
that it’s disgusting; looking like the<br>
only hip-hop motherfuckers on schindler’s list.<br>
being a malnutrition-ass got nothing to do<br>
with being revolutionary or being on-point.<br>
i’ll be damned if i let somebody else push<br>
their agenda on me. you know i don’t eat pork,<br>
not because i’m a muslim, i just don’t<br>
really like it, but i really will<br>
fuck a bird up. and fish is good<br>
when that shit is fresh. it’s like my nigga<br>
cow from Kaitnieks says if you don’t like<br>
the smell of burning meat, well then get<br>
the fuck off the planet.</p>

<p>just outa intrest if you were on the lawn at the same time as the dear are you saying the dear would kill and eat you?</p>
<p>Personaly i dont care what the vegens or vegitarians do its their life and as long as they dont get me to try and convert im fine with them i even tryed being one for a while and anyone who can do it then well done</p>
<p>PaulT</p>
<p>actualy you cant get away with a rant about bad health as its not true anymore… there are lots of soya products that not ownly are very helthy and has a lot of nutriants for a bean but if you dont like that then its possable to be perfectly healthy just eating plants or non meat products its ownly bad for you if your limeted by allergyes like i was</p>
<p>Finaly</p>
<p>Vegitarians and vegens are diffrent things ( i think ) vegitarians normaly just dont eat meat and eat everyghing else ( some eat fish for some reason… are they less of an animal than a whale? ) but vegens genraly dont eat meat, fish and animal food products (eg. milk, eggs)</p>

        <p>I think you guys got me all wrong, I do not dislike vegetarians/vegans, I just hate the psuedo ones and the ones who try to push me into converting. If they keep to themselves, then they are fine by me.</p>
<p>Faile, I didn’t say a deer would come onto my lawn and kill me and eat me. But if it came on my lawn I would kill and eat it. Heck, I would even come on its “lawn” and kill and eat it.

<p>Ah-men to that!</p>
<p>Some people don’t eat meat because they think hurting animals is wrong, and I just cannot stand that. How did we evlove? There is no way that any of us would be here today if it wasn;t for our ansestors being able to hunt + eat meat. There just would not have been enough food.</p>
<p>People do not realize that killing animals for food, onyl gets rid of the acces population, which will die off anyway.</p>
<p>Imagine it as a bucket. Each spring the tab goes on, and water (animals) are poured into the bucket (Nature.) There are some leaks in the bucket, hence some of the water seeps out (Animals dying from disease, etc…) But the bucket (ecosystem) can only hold so much water, and every year the overflow has to go somewhere. So, instead of causing all the animals starvation, due to lack of food in an enviroment, if we kill off the acces population it does not effect the population of the animal.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is just for hunting, and trapping…</p>
<p>With Cows+Chickens, etc… that we bread just to eat, as long as it isn’t effecting the Enviroment, why is it such a problem??</p>

        <p>We are designed to be meat eaters.  Look at our teeth.  Our eyes are in the fronts of our heads, not on the sides.  We are predators.  If we weren’t meant to eat meat, we wouldn’t have the teeth we have.  We would also have more of a problem digesting it.</p>
<p>But we were also given the ability to think and to show compassion rather than act purely off of instinct (Although in reality, it is instinct that makes us think about things before acting.  And no scientist or study can tell us for sure what animals think/know so I’m just assuming animals are dumb beasts with no thought process as the anti-vegetarian people/scientists assume.)  With that, you can decide on your own if you were to eat meat or not.</p>
