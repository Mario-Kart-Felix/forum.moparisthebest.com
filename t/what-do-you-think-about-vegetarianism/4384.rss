    <title>What do you think about vegetarianism?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-think-about-vegetarianism/4384</link>
    <description>I just want to know who is a vegan, why the are/aren&#39;t, etc. But [i]please[/i] do not let this turn into a flame war.

Me:
I am NOT a vegetarian. In fact, vegans tend to annoy me severely. Some kid was walking around my school trying to get everyone to become vegans. He is lucky I&#39;m nice, or I would have beaten the living crap out of him. Of course, I bet someone else already did. Heres the five main types of vegans:

Nazi Vegans: These idiots try to change everyones mind and make all meat eaters go vegan. Then they get mad when they wont. I personally HATE these ones, and feel like slamming them against a wall.

Psuedo (fake) vegans: These just annoy me. They are the ones who say &quot;Oh I don&#39;t eat meat, but I eat chicken (or fish).&quot; I have nothing to say to these ones. Some of them even get mad at peope who eat beef, etc.

Standard Vegans: I have no problem with these ones. They are vegans, but keep to themselves, and don&#39;t get mad at meat eaters. If a meat eaters question them about it, they also put up a good debate, which I also respect.

Obsessive vegans: The ones who are afraid to step on bugs, or afraid to look at an animal funny in the fear of &quot;scaring&quot; it. They are fun to make fun of.

Hide in a corner Vegans: The ones who are vegan, leave people alone and let them eat meat, but if someone questions them about it, they don&#39;t put up a good debate or support their oppinion. These ones are usually just trying to be the &quot;hero&quot;.

Summary:
I am fine with vegans, but I can&#39;t stand the ones who are obsessive, bossy, or cannot support their opinion. I think animals are meant to be eaten, period. I know that sounds harsh, but I include humans in that too. If we get lost in the woods or general wilderness, we will get eaten. If I lived in the woods and a dear is on my lawn, I would pull out a gun and next thing you know I have dinner, a very good one at that. If you ask me, thats fair. They can kill us, so I WILL kill them. Of course, I wouldn&#39;t hunt for sport, I would eat what I kill.</description>

              <p>We are designed to be meat eaters.  Look at our teeth.  Our eyes are in the fronts of our heads, not on the sides.  We are predators.  If we weren’t meant to eat meat, we wouldn’t have the teeth we have.  We would also have more of a problem digesting it.</p>
<p>But we were also given the ability to think and to show compassion rather than act purely off of instinct (Although in reality, it is instinct that makes us think about things before acting.  And no scientist or study can tell us for sure what animals think/know so I’m just assuming animals are dumb beasts with no thought process as the anti-vegetarian people/scientists assume.)  With that, you can decide on your own if you were to eat meat or not.</p>

<p>Ah-men to that!</p>
<p>Some people don’t eat meat because they think hurting animals is wrong, and I just cannot stand that. How did we evlove? There is no way that any of us would be here today if it wasn;t for our ansestors being able to hunt + eat meat. There just would not have been enough food.</p>
<p>People do not realize that killing animals for food, onyl gets rid of the acces population, which will die off anyway.</p>
<p>Imagine it as a bucket. Each spring the tab goes on, and water (animals) are poured into the bucket (Nature.) There are some leaks in the bucket, hence some of the water seeps out (Animals dying from disease, etc…) But the bucket (ecosystem) can only hold so much water, and every year the overflow has to go somewhere. So, instead of causing all the animals starvation, due to lack of food in an enviroment, if we kill off the acces population it does not effect the population of the animal.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is just for hunting, and trapping…</p>
<p>With Cows+Chickens, etc… that we bread just to eat, as long as it isn’t effecting the Enviroment, why is it such a problem??</p>

<p>Not all vegetarians try to push their beliefs on other people.

              <p>[quote=“Zach1188, post:1, topic:4384”]I just want to know who is a vegan, why the are/aren’t, etc. But <span class="bbcode-i">please</span> do not let this turn into a flame war.</p>
<p>Me:<br>
I am NOT a vegetarian. In fact, vegans tend to annoy me severely. Some kid was walking around my school trying to get everyone to become vegans. He is lucky I’m nice, or I would have beaten the living crap out of him. Of course, I bet someone else already did. Heres the five main types of vegans:</p>
<p>Nazi Vegans: These idiots try to change everyones mind and make all meat eaters go vegan. Then they get mad when they wont. I personally HATE these ones, and feel like slamming them against a wall.</p>
<p>Psuedo (fake) vegans: These just annoy me. They are the ones who say “Oh I don’t eat meat, but I eat chicken (or fish).” I have nothing to say to these ones. Some of them even get mad at peope who eat beef, etc.</p>
<p>Standard Vegans: I have no problem with these ones. They are vegans, but keep to themselves, and don’t get mad at meat eaters. If a meat eaters question them about it, they also put up a good debate, which I also respect.</p>
<p>Obsessive vegans: The ones who are afraid to step on bugs, or afraid to look at an animal funny in the fear of “scaring” it. They are fun to make fun of.</p>
<p>Hide in a corner Vegans: The ones who are vegan, leave people alone and let them eat meat, but if someone questions them about it, they don’t put up a good debate or support their oppinion. These ones are usually just trying to be the “hero”.</p>
<p>Summary:<br>
I am fine with vegans, but I can’t stand the ones who are obsessive, bossy, or cannot support their opinion. I think animals are meant to be eaten, period. I know that sounds harsh, but I include humans in that too. If we get lost in the woods or general wilderness, we will get eaten. If I lived in the woods and a dear is on my lawn, I would pull out a gun and next thing you know I have dinner, a very good one at that. If you ask me, thats fair. They can kill us, so I WILL kill them. Of course, I wouldn’t hunt for sport, I would eat what I kill.[/quote]</p>
<p>just outa intrest if you were on the lawn at the same time as the dear are you saying the dear would kill and eat you?</p>
<p>Personaly i dont care what the vegens or vegitarians do its their life and as long as they dont get me to try and convert im fine with them i even tryed being one for a while and anyone who can do it then well done</p>
<p>PaulT</p>
<p>actualy you cant get away with a rant about bad health as its not true anymore… there are lots of soya products that not ownly are very helthy and has a lot of nutriants for a bean but if you dont like that then its possable to be perfectly healthy just eating plants or non meat products its ownly bad for you if your limeted by allergyes like i was</p>
<p>Finaly</p>
<p>Vegitarians and vegens are diffrent things ( i think ) vegitarians normaly just dont eat meat and eat everyghing else ( some eat fish for some reason… are they less of an animal than a whale? ) but vegens genraly dont eat meat, fish and animal food products (eg. milk, eggs)</p>
