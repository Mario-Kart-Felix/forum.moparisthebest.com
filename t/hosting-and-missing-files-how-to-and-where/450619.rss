    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hosting-and-missing-files-how-to-and-where/450619</link>
    <description>OK hey guys. For some stupid reason, I can&#39;t find what people talk about in the tutorials. I&#39;m using a Project insanity based server. And i can&#39;t figure out to host it V_V I have No-IP, and setup my forwarded ports and whatnot on my router. But I havn&#39;t touched any of the server or client files yet. 

Also. For some reason, I don&#39;t have a Class8.java &gt;.&lt; I am trying to add claws and Korasi&#39;s but :/ i can&#39;t find this one.

Anybody got an answer? I&#39;m relatively new at this. and havn&#39;t done a ton of stuff, barely any at all. So somebody will have to walk me through it. where everything is and whatever specifically U_U</description>

The tutorials you are reading is for delta servers, this is basic knowledge you realy shouldn’t be trying to start your own server of you can’t even find the right tutorials.
