    <title>A Change In The Rules Needed?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-change-in-the-rules-needed/21192</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;m guilty for both of these, but I must protest about myself and others.

[b][u]Leaving Threads[/u][/b]

People seem to be just leaving to see what replies they get on their thread. I know I made a leaving thread and all, and came back within a short period of time, which was unexpected ;). There are lots of them at the moment. An example of this would be a guy called &quot;wall of fir&quot;. He made a leaving thread saying he would be gone for 3 weeks, and then came back a week later to make a thread &quot;my 3 weeks are up&quot;.

Another example would be, forgot his name xD. He made a thread saying &quot;Leaving RuneScape sections&quot; and it said inside, I&#39;m leaving the runescape section to get more involved in SCAR. I mean how the fuck does that even work?

I&#39;m asking that leaving threads be posted and locked. Just so people can make note and not bother about &quot;bumping them&quot;. I also ask that they get permission to make a leaving thread.

For example, a Junior Member would get declined to make one, but a Senior Member with 30+ rep would be allowed to make one. Just a though

[b][u]Advertising[/u][/b]

I, again, an guilty. I posted a advert in the Graphics section with my new forum, but I think advertising needs to be restricted. Maybe the admins granting permission would have to base it on something like:

Forum subject - If it&#39;s something like &quot;RS2 ch33ting&quot; then you would say declined, but if it was something new and original, it would be accepted.

Domain - Maybe only accepting paid domains. E.G .com, .net, .org ect. This might be too strict, as not everyone can afford/get hosting. 

Advertising Thread Content - If it&#39;s something like &quot;looking for 5 admins and 10 G. Mods, first forum member who enter get them&quot; then they wouldn&#39;t be allowed to advertise. Lets face it, any forum that runs like that has no chance in a million years to be successful.

I know some of those &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;guidelines&quot; may seem harsh, but Mopar, your being too soft ;)


Well, thanks for reading xx</description>

All i can say is … I got bullied into Chris posting it .</p>
<p>I’m only joking… again</p>
<p>First off i thought i will just slip out and not tell anyone. Just gradually dissapear. But in the end changed my mind and Chris posted it for me.<br>
Advertising… Yes i have advertised =( But did have permission…</p>
