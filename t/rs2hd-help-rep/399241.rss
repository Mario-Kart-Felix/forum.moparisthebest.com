    <description>Changed the ip in client.java

I have ported correctly
Fire wall is set
No-ip is set
I always run server before i run client
My path/classpath is working fine as well
my jdk is updated
and yea i did fix jdk inside of *run* on both clients and compiler

I even had a 317 running and that client connected just fine, but when i tried using a 562 the client would not connect to my ip, i even had to try turning off windows fire wall completly.  this did not work i have no idea why i cant get this to work, i will rep++ if you can help me i do have team viewer and msn pm me for details</description>
