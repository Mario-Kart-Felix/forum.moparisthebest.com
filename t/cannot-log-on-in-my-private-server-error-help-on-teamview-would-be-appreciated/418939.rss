    <title>Cannot Log on in my private server! ERROR (Help on TEAMVIEW would be appreciated</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cannot-log-on-in-my-private-server-error-help-on-teamview-would-be-appreciated/418939</link>
    <description>Im new to making private servers and i followed a few tutorials that taught me how to portforward and make a no-ip account. I followed the directions, downloaded Project Insanity client and server. After launching the server and then lauchin the client, i patiently waited while it was loading. Once i tried to log on it said &quot;Error Connection to Server&quot;.
  I checked the server and everything &quot;seemed&quot; to be ok(although i wouldnt know anyway). 
Do i have to compile anything or change some files so that the client will properly connect with the server?
Thank you for your help!</description>

Then when i downloaded it and ran it o my other computer, it doesntwork. The client says," Error connecting to server".  Pretty much like the initial problem except on a different computer. can anyone downloadthe client and see if whats wrong?</p>

              <p>[quote=“Clawd, post:1, topic:418939”]Im new to making private servers and i followed a few tutorials that taught me how to portforward and make a no-ip account. I followed the directions, downloaded Project Insanity client and server. After launching the server and then lauchin the client, i patiently waited while it was loading. Once i tried to log on it said “Error Connection to Server”.<br>
I checked the server and everything “seemed” to be ok(although i wouldnt know anyway).<br>
Do i have to compile anything or change some files so that the client will properly connect with the server?<br>
Thank you for your help![/quote]<br>
