    <description>[center][b]Welcome to Classic PK[/b][/center]

Let me start by explaining what exactly I wanna accomplish here.
We all remember when RuneScape 2 first came out, My self I loved it although I mostly played F2P! Anyway All server I&#39;ve seen you start with 500k/m and full food ready to PK. I wanna bring back skilling, low lvl pking etc, etc, But I don&#39;t wanna make it to hard therefor the XP will still be good(Medium)!

This project will hopefully be very good and appreciated my all the members and my self!


My real name is mario syring I am 21 years old and currently not working.
My RuneScape world started 1 month before it switched to RS2 therefor I played more RS2 then RSC, and I loved it I played day out day in.

I need you help to re-create skilling finding bugs adding missing items and much more I will simple update the server (Hardcore coding one week). Then I will remove all users, and Add the most necessary items you need to start.
You will start with money and more now to PK and exploit everything and I will edit it on people wishes!

<p>I was expecting you to be a smart and logical 21-year-old, apparently (and unfortunately) you’re not.
