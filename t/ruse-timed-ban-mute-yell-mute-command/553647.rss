    <title>Ruse - Timed ban/mute/yell mute command!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ruse-timed-ban-mute-yell-mute-command/553647</link>
    <description>Hey,

I want to add a timed ban, mute &amp; yell command to my source (Ruse). I have no idea where to start though.. I found this thread:
[url=http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/tutorials/537344-pi-my-time-based-mute-ban-system.html]http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/tutorials/537344-pi-my-time-based-mute-ban-system.html[/url].

Could anyone help me over Skype/Teamviewer to convert it to fit the Ruse server? That would be awesome..
My skype is: r.sala13

Ofcourse if you don&#39;t want everyone to know your skype you could pm it to me or just add me and i&#39;ll add you back.
Also if you don&#39;t want to add me on Skype at all, any help is fine, that also counts for just helping me via this Thread ;)

I honestly have no idea where to start and how to do it, i&#39;ve tryed finding some existing systems (like the one i gave earlier) but i have absolutely no clue on how to convert it to Ruse..

Please help me :)
Thanks in advance</description>
