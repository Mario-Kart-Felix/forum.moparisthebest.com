    <title>Connection problems</title>

    <description>After portforwarding, I can connect to the server. However, other people cannot. So, I&#39;m wanting some help from you guys.

The client I&#39;m using, if it matters, is the AGS Pking client, with modifications. The IP I used to portforward was my default gateway from typing &quot;ipconfig&quot; in the CMD.

Help is appreciated.</description>
