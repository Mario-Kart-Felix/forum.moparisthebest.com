    <description>Alright, so I&#39;ve got a server I&#39;m working on, everything compile&#39;s fine, but now it&#39;s the hosting. I have found a way around having to portforward and use Hamachi.

I know this method works, because whenever I or my friend (diff comp on diff network) try to connect, we both get &quot;Server Restarted Or Updated, Try Again In A Minute.&quot;

and that message wouldnt show up if it wasnt getting that response from the server I&#39;m hosting.

Any ideas?
