    <title>[637/639] Making npc&#39;s attack all players</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/637-639-making-npcs-attack-all-players/538752</link>
    <description>I have trouble with npc&#39;s in combat with multiple players in my server. The npc&#39;s will only attack one person, and won&#39;t switch between players. If there&#39;s 3 players fighting bandos for example, and player 1 walks into the room first, the minions and bandos all attack player 1. And they don&#39;t ever change and try attacking players 2/3
Ideas on how to fix this are greatly appreciated - thank you all in advance!</description>
