    <description>I was bored didn&#39;t see one of this tutorials, so I thought I&#39;d add it here. I&#39;ll give a brief explanation on the code other than that it&#39;s pretty much Copy and paste.
Also this is my first tut so keep the flame out please

[b][size=10pt]Description[/size][/b]How to add timers to mutes. The timer will only go down if they&#39;re logged on. And brief explanation about the code.
[b][size=10pt]Difficulty[/size][/b] 1/10
[b][size=10pt]Assumed Knowledge[/size][/b] Declaring imports, variables. Copy &amp; Paste
[b][size=10pt]Files Modified[/size][/b] Client.java, Playersave.java, Player.java, Chat.java and Commands.java

First off we&#39;ll be editing the Client.java file

So first of all add this Import to your Client.java
This allows any methods which are in the file &quot;Connection.java&quot; file to be used in your client.java file

[code=java]import server.Connection;[/code]

[code=java]
if(muteTimer2 &lt; 6000){
 muteTimer2-= 0.5;
}[/code]

This is basic stuff, it means if the players muteTimer2 is less than 6000 it will take 0.5 away from their saved muteTimer2

[code=java]
if(muteTimer2 &lt;= 0 ){
Connection.unMuteUser(playerName);
muteTimer2 = 6000;
 }[/code]
Remember when we declared the import? Now we can use the Unmute method which is in the connection.java file. 
If the players muteTimer is  less or equal to 0 then it will unMute them and there muteTimer2 will be reset back to 6000


Now we will be editing the Chat.java file
Add this
[code=java]c.sendMessage(&quot;I Am Muted, I have &quot; + (Math.round(c.muteTimer2*0.0166)+ &quot; Minutes Left before being unmuted&quot;));[/code]

Under [code=java] if (Connection.isMuted(c)){[/code]

 Dont worry I&#39;ll explain it. 

All that line does is send Aamessage to the user, on how much time they have left of being muted. It rounds the Double to one decimal place, and converts the double to minutes so the user knows exactly how long they have until they will be unmuted. That&#39;s the best I can explain it to ya.

You&#39;ll also need this in Commands.java

[code=java]
if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;mute&quot;)) {
              String playerToBan = playerCommand.substring(5);
               for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
              Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[i];
if(Server.playerHandler.players[i] != null) {
if(Server.playerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToBan)) {
Connection.addNameToMuteList(playerToBan);
           c2.sendMessage(&quot;You have been muted by: &quot; + c.playerName);
           c.sendMessage(&quot;You have muted: &quot; + c2.playerName);
           c2.muteTimer2 -= 0.5;
                                               
                                                                                                                    }
                                                       
                                                                }
                                                                           }
                                                         }[/code]
All this does is mute the player yes, but it also takes away 0.5 from the players Timer. If you remember the code we added to the client.java it was

[code=java]if(muteTimer2 &lt; 6000){
muteTimer2 -= 0.5;
}[/code]
 These two commands work together the mute command will take away 0.5 from the players timer and then the code we added into the client will take away 0.5; until it reaches 0 because the timer is now not equal or lower than 6000


Now declare this in player.java

[code=java]public double muteTimer2 = 6000; [/code]

Then add these in playersave.java

[code=java]

characterfile.newLine();
characterfile.write(&quot;mute-timer2 = &quot;, 0, 14);
characterfile.write(Double.toString(p.muteTimer2), 0, Double.toString(p.muteTimer2).length());
characterfile.newLine();[/code]

[code=java]} else if (token.equals(&quot;mute-timer2&quot;)) {
p.muteTimer2 = Double.parseDouble(token2);
[/code]

The [code=java]public double muteTimer2 = 6000;[/code] 
the 6000; is 100 minutes so change the number to what ever default time you want a mute for

Post any errors if you get any I&#39;ll help you.</description>

</aside>
<p>The server is constantly checking if the players timer2 double is lower than 6000 and if it is then it will keep taking 0.5 away from it as long as its lower than 6000… I really can’t explain more than that. I understand what you mean, but I really cant explain it any better.<br>
O yea, I just noticed why you thought I meant higher than 6000, it was a human error I meant lower than in the tutorial it’s fixed now.</p>

<p>Instead of typing “::checkmute”, you should add it so when the player talks it says the amount of time left in the mute. Also, the player could simply afk this overnight to get around a longer mute. You should make 24 hour mutes that save in a file under it’s own name, like ‘24hrmutes.txt’, and after the <span class="bbcode-i">server</span> being online for 24 hours, it will automatically remove the player’s name from that list.

<p>Yea, just edited the tutorial, instead of the command it will send you a message via the chat if you’re muted , when you type.</p>

              <p>[quote=“imsuperman05, post:4, topic:411869”]I’m not understanding the concept… You’re subtracting .5 when you use the command, i get that.  But when it’s equal to 0 then it adds 6000 and unmutes them? Why?  Also, when it’s above 6000 it subtracts 0.5? And, your starting off with 6000?  Why not just start off with 0 and go from there by adding 6000?  It’s making absolutely no sense.  The command looks disgusting.  Explain to me why you added it that way.[/quote] Because the it Unmutes them when the timer is equal or lower than 0 , it then adds 6000 back to the timer, just encase in the future u want to mute them again. Look at the mute command</p>
<p>Did you see</p>
<p>[code=java]<br>
c2.sendMessage("You have been muted by: " + c.playerName);<br>
c.sendMessage("You have muted: " + c2.playerName);</p>
<pre><code>    c2.muteTimer2 -= 0.5;[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>the c2.muteTimer2 is removing 0.5 off of 6000; which will make the next statement which is in client.java true so then the timer is getting used…It’s actually self explantory. You’re removing the 0.5 from the player ur muting. Thust making the if statement in the client.java true. then it will keep removin 0.5 until it’s 0 and when its 0 they will be removed from the muted user files. Then you’re adding 6000 back again. And as its not lower than 6000 the timer wont go down which means they’re not muted… You do this just encase you want to mute them again.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The client.java if stateement</p>
<p><code>if(muteTimer2 &lt; 6000){
muteTime -= 0.5;
}</code></p>
<p>Do you understand now?</p>
<p>And yea, I could of done it that way by adding ++ to the timer instead of taking away and making the double = 0 but I found this way better for myself. It’s also easier to understand tbh…But you need to remember that there’s always going to be more than one way to implement code which does the same thing it is intended to do…</p>
<p>If you prefer it that way be my guest, this tutorial shows you how to work with timers so you should be able to take that and make it the way you want to have it…<br>
I made this tutorial at the top of my head. Meaning I just intended it to work.</p>

muteTimer2 = 6000;
 }</code><br>
Remember when we declared the import? Now we can use the Unmute method which is in the connection.java file.<br>
If the players muteTimer is  less or equal to 0 then it will unMute them and there muteTimer2 will be reset back to 6000</p>
<p>Now we will be editing the Chat.java file<br>
Add this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Under <code> if (Connection.isMuted(c)){</code></p>
<p>Dont worry I’ll explain it.</p>
<p>All that line does is send Aamessage to the user, on how much time they have left of being muted. It rounds the Double to one decimal place, and converts the double to minutes so the user knows exactly how long they have until they will be unmuted. That’s the best I can explain it to ya.</p>
<p>You’ll also need this in Commands.java</p>
<p>[code=java]<br>
if (playerCommand.startsWith(“mute”)) {<br>
String playerToBan = playerCommand.substring(5);<br>
for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {<br>
Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[i];<br>
if(Server.playerHandler.players[i] != null) {<br>
if(Server.playerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToBan)) {<br>
Connection.addNameToMuteList(playerToBan);<br>
c2.sendMessage("You have been muted by: " + c.playerName);<br>
c.sendMessage("You have muted: " + c2.playerName);<br>
c2.muteTimer2 -= 0.5;</p>
<pre><code>                                                                                                                }
                                                   
                                                            }
                                                                       }
                                                     }[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>All this does is mute the player yes, but it also takes away 0.5 from the players Timer. If you remember the code we added to the client.java it was</p>
<p><code>if(muteTimer2 &lt; 6000){
muteTimer2 -= 0.5;
}</code><br>
These two commands work together the mute command will take away 0.5 from the players timer and then the code we added into the client will take away 0.5; until it reaches 0 because the timer is now not equal or lower than 6000</p>
<p>Now declare this in player.java</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Then add these in playersave.java</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
characterfile.newLine();
characterfile.write("mute-timer2 = ", 0, 14);
characterfile.write(Double.toString(p.muteTimer2), 0, Double.toString(p.muteTimer2).length());
characterfile.newLine();[/code]

[code=java]} else if (token.equals("mute-timer2")) {
p.muteTimer2 = Double.parseDouble(token2);</code></pre>
<p>The <code>public double muteTimer2 = 6000;</code><br>
the 6000; is 100 minutes so change the number to what ever default time you want a mute for</p>
<p>Post any errors if you get any I’ll help you.</p>
