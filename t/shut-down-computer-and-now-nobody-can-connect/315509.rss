    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shut-down-computer-and-now-nobody-can-connect/315509</link>
    <description>for some reason i shut my computer down and when i turned it back on no one could connect. ive shut it down before and it worked still and also the server works because im able tog et on so i think it has something to do with the portforwarding. ive gone through and double checked the no ip and the router stuff and i cant figure it out. does anyone know why it would be working one moment then not after a restart?</description>

              <p>Your router IP stays the same your computers IP could change due to the router. go to your network connection, right click your internet connection your using, hit status, then click support, and look for your ip address it will be something like 128.165.3.1 something like that don’t use the default gateway because that is the routers ip.</p>
