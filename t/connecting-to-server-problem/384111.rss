    <title>Connecting to server problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-to-server-problem/384111</link>
    <description>Hey,

I&#39;m running the server on my other computer whilst I go on this computer, they&#39;re both linked to the same router.

I can log on the server if I&#39;m using the computer which is running the server but on this computer it will not let me log on at all,

I&#39;ve tried all IP&#39;s such as:
0.0.0.0,
127.0.0.1,
MY IP,
gravescape.no-ip.org

Is there a way for me to log on the server without being on the same computer which is running the server?

Thanks for your help in advance.</description>
