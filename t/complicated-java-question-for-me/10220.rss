    <title>Complicated java question (for me)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/complicated-java-question-for-me/10220</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know java as well as some of you on this forum but I have no were else to go and I have been trying all day. You know random.misc(1000) for example is a random number pluss 1000 so it&#39;s x + 1000 well how do I say in java to have a range 1-5 and only to pick from that range then add it onto 1000. The reason I want this is so I can have random object spawning but only in a sertain area and not all over the entire map so you can acturly see it spawning the random objects. 

This is the code im trying to do it to::
[code]if(objectID == 1591) { //
sendMessage(&quot;You spawn some fire. How glichy he he.&quot;);
createNewTileObject(3269, 3434, 6818 , 0, 10))
}[/code]

Does anybody know??

I want random 1-5 + 3269 and random 1-5 + 3434 if thats possible thank you?</description>
