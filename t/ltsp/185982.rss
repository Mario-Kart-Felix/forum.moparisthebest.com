    <description>Hello, I would like to set one of these up, but I had a few questions:
1) Would I be able to do it if the server was ran under a virtual machine?
2) Would I be able to do this with the wireless cards on laptops being the workstations?
3) Would I be able to do this if said laptops had damaged hard drives [pretty sure the answer is yes, but just want to verify]?
4) How could I do this?
Sorry If I seem uneducated in the area, but it&#39;s because I am.</description>
