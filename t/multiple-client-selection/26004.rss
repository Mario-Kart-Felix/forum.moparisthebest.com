    <description>It would be so much easier to auto with multiple client select. You could multilog auto and get tons more money(or whatever your doing). please comment on the idea, pros cons.</description>

              <p>i made a script like this -</p>
<p>[CENTER]Multiple Scar Auto miner</p>
<p>this script uses 2 scar windows and 2 scar windows which both share the same mouse, so it does differ to the new ubi bot.<span class="bbcode-u"> Before i go on i would like to explain that this script is in its BETA and will be improved with the help of testers and reports.</span> Alot mroe cna be done with the fucntions ive used and i hope to take full advantage of them as soon as you post feedback. ALOT of hard work went into this script <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> please dont unappreciate it as i can remove it at anytime and cease updating.</p>
<p>[CENTER]Preparation for autoing[/CENTER]</p>
<p>You will need to open two scar windows<br>
then open one official runescape window<br>
know visit my world switcher and open another window <a data-bbcode="true">HERE</a></p>
<p>It is vital that you DO NOT open two official runescape windows but one official and one from my site.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Your screen should know look something like this - </span></p>
<p><a href="http://imageshack.us" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/9089/pic16iv.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>NOTE - remember to open the “sender” script first and the “receiver” script after to allow you to start and stop the sender with ctrl+alt+r and ctrl+alt+s.</p>
<p>Your scar windows should look a bit like this -</p>
<p><a href="http://imageshack.us" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img275.imageshack.us/img275/5778/pic21es.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Know you have completed this simply enter the data needed (usernames and pass and rock types) then click play on the receiver miner, do not worry about it doing anything because it will only do so once the sender has completed its first mining attempt.</p>
<p>Know bring the official runescape client to the front and press ctrl+alt+run <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The reports will be something like this -</p>

<p>The script should set up, get the rock colors then switch clients do the same and mine in a loop.

              <p>Welp… mostly just injecting code to redirect calls to BitBlt [and such] that SCAR calls before its functions. Just injects at runtime so that no one has to patch anything.<br>
That way, itstead of getting the actual contents of the window, it searches whatever I wish.</p>
<p>I had to do that after failing with the SetTargetBitmap or w/e…<br>
It worked technically, but it relied on constant refreshing (which I had a function to set the refresh interval). For for time sensitive operations (like many randoms), this would be bad since it’d require high refresh rates thus making it overkill for the portions of the script that didn’t need it.<br>
So just having it refresh when SCAR made the API calls makes it easier.<br>
However, I don’t think it works perfectly… not to mention it’s useless on RS without a good mouse clicking routine.</p>

              <p>Yeah, RS is a resource whore. So you can usually not handle more than a few instances.</p>

<p>Not only good for getting pixels off covered windows, but also can modify the pixels before they’re checked by SCAR. That required actual editing of SCAR.exe itself… but luckily I got the plugin to do that bit at runtime.<br>
As you can see in the screenshot, it modifys the client to 4-bit color before SCAR searches it. (such things can be good for tolerances)<br>
And it draws the client to the debug window on a loop. That can be used for monitoring all instances you’re autoing on… in case of error. And could be edited to be similar to my RS client preview thumbnails:</p>

              <p>Because you can get banned if you send typing or mouse clicks to the client when the window is not in focus. Because that is not normally possible… and the applet can easily monitor focus events. That’s the major prob.<br>
That’s why impsoft made UBI. But you can technically make a better multi auto method is you can either trick windows into thinking they have focus… or actually forcing multiple windows to have focus at the same time.<br>
I know how to get Windows to give multiple focus, but it has problems that I don’t know how to solve. So I can’t help with that yet.</p>

              <p>Well if you have home sort of cord orginization such as (c1x,c1y) for client 1 x and client 1 y that might help. You could also have each of the runescape client windows maximized so that you could use some comand that would send a specific client to the front(im not so good with scar yet so i dont know what that command is).</p>

              <p>Your screen would like to be 600x800, and instead of just selecting the runescape window, you’d have to select the hole screen, so it would know where to scroll the mouse, it would have to know the location (x,y) on the screen, so wouldn’t it be kinda difficult to make it scroll down to the coords, and, figure out what the coords are.</p>

              <p>Well, if you have big res, like 1600x1200 or more, you can have 4-9 RS clients visible for SCAR. The biggest problem is the mouse pointer. It would be stupid (and very detectable) to make single pointer to jump crazily from client to client…).<br>
Another solution for multiple clients with SCAR is to use VMWare for emulating as many virtual computers on your computer as you can fit in your RAM. The con is - VMWare is not a freeware.</p>

              <p>Yeah, but would be too hard to have multiple window selection and script managing. Best to just use multiple instance of SCAR to control the autoing of each window.<br>
The only difficult part though it figuring out how to process event in the back ground. You’d need to make a better “silently clicking” method than the one SCAR has. Not to mention you’d have to get SCAR to retrieve colors from window in the background… but I already have that done in an old plugin I made. So now I’d just need to make mouse events.</p>

              <p>It would be so much easier to auto with multiple client select. You could multilog auto and get tons more money(or whatever your doing). please comment on the idea, pros cons.</p>
