    <title>New bot: Cherokee</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-bot-cherokee/44797</link>
    <description>I posted this in the CM forums at first to get some more educated responses, eventually I will make a thread in the public sections.  However until then it is posted on sf.net, so don&#39;t feel like you have to keep it a secret.

I ask that you please read the entire post before responding, and sucking up posts like &#39;good job&#39; really aren&#39;t wanted, thanks. ;D

[quote=&quot;readme.txt&quot;]Cherokee is a fully extensible and scriptable automation engine for any and all java applets.
To make it work for your favorite java applet the most you have to do is write is two classes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This bot&#39;s goal is to provide a scripting and input solution for any and all java applets.
It can be used on ANY program that extends java.applet.Applet. I have provided a few examples
on how to run and use the bot including one script, and 3 different applet examples each 
having a unique way of loading the classes.

The bot was written in a way as to make it very flexible, for example there is no restriction
on how the classes are loaded, or even how AccessorMethods works, you can even generate it on
the fly.  Some ideas for an AccessorMethods class include color finding/clicking routines,
heavy duty reflection and/or bcel usage, or even bytecode injected method calls, the 
possibilities are truly endless.

There are 2 important parts to using this bot:

	The Interfaces:
		You must write 2 classes, one implementing the com.cherokee.Setup interface and the 
		other implementing the com.cherokee.AccessorMethods interface, the name of your setup
		class must be included in the conf file which is sent in as the first paramater when
		running the application.

	The conf file:
		The conf file is formated like a java Properties file, and currently has 3 required 
		paramaters which are &quot;getCodeBase&quot;, &quot;getDocumentBase&quot;, &quot;Setup&quot;, look at the example 
		conf files in the ./conf/ folder for more information.
		
There is also a debug mode which can be activated by sending in a second parameter, this will
simply print to the command line some extra information, like the parameters being asked for.

The current examples can be ran with the following commands(replace ; with : in *nix):

java -cp .;./bin/ com.cherokee.Cherokee ./conf/test.conf
java -cp .;./bin/ com.cherokee.Cherokee ./conf/rs2.conf
java -cp .;./bin/ com.cherokee.Cherokee ./conf/rsc.conf


todo:

-Implement an event triggered Scripting system to be ran in the same thread as the main
 application, perhaps triggered to be processed by bytecode injected method calls.
-Perhaps allow more modifiers to be sent with mouse presses, such as ctrl, alt, and shift.
-There are also few various todo:&#39;s scattered around the source code that need attention.

Changelog:

Version 0.1b
First public release. Far from a finished product.[/quote]

You can download this either in a prepackaged .zip form or by checking out from the svn from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/cherokee/

This is as you see a very early beta, and not a finished product.  I ask for any and all suggestions I can get on my structure, implementation, or anything really.  The part that I worked very hard on and tested very thoroughly is the contents of the com.cherokee.event package, with the tester app I wrote I made sure every input was identical to human input, not leaving out the slightest detail, if anyone has suggestions for it, or sees where it could be detectable, please let me know.

When the actual structure of the bot is very solid, I will be working on an updater for RS2. The updater itself will probably be private, so as to be able to control the spread of the bot, but that has not been decided yet.

Lastly, if anyone would like to volunteer their time on either the programming of the bot or updater, I am looking for a dev team, so just volunteer. :)

Thanks a lot, I am looking forward to a lively debate and many good suggestions. ;D</description>

              <p>Still haven’t looked, but it seems like having multiple target Applet classes wouldn’t be too much of a mod - this is, after all, an open source project. A Collection and some loops would take care of it, probably.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/geno">@Geno</a>: if you’re going to say there are flaws with something, try to follow up with specifics. Lack of a feature does not necessarily constitute a flaw.

<p>The reason I made it so broad was for a few reasons, because I could, and so that it never gets to the point of having no use, it can really never be ‘broken’ as long as java applets exist as we know them.</p>
<p>Good point about the bot wording, perhaps something like ‘Automation Engine’ would be more suitable?</p>

<p>While it can’t hurt, something like this that heavily uses interfaces, abstract classes and polymorphism may get a little confusing for a first time java experience. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>In the next few days I will probably write a small AccessorMethods class so that the bot actually works and you can see how by example.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/krichevskoy">@krichevskoy</a>, I implemented your ingenious idea of the script being able to define it’s own mouse path algorithim, and used event creation methods like you suggested as well, see if that suits your needs.</p>
<p>I will still appreciate any feedback, especially on the input system(located in the com.cherokee.event package).</p>

<h2>The code <em>may</em> be used under a lesser license (such as the LGPL) only by<br>

<p>This bot’s goal is to provide a scripting and input solution for any and all java applets.<br>
It can be used on ANY program that extends java.applet.Applet. I have provided a few examples<br>
on how to run and use the bot including one script, and 3 different applet examples each<br>
having a unique way of loading the classes.</p>
<p>The bot was written in a way as to make it very flexible, for example there is no restriction<br>
on how the classes are loaded, or even how AccessorMethods works, you can even generate it on<br>
the fly.  Some ideas for an AccessorMethods class include color finding/clicking routines,<br>
heavy duty reflection and/or bcel usage, or even bytecode injected method calls, the<br>
possibilities are truly endless.</p>
<p>There are 2 important parts to using this bot:</p>
<pre><code>The Interfaces:
	You must write 2 classes, one implementing the com.cherokee.Setup interface and the 
	other implementing the com.cherokee.AccessorMethods interface, the name of your setup
	class must be included in the conf file which is sent in as the first paramater when
	running the application.

The conf file:
	The conf file is formated like a java Properties file, and currently has 3 required 
	paramaters which are "getCodeBase", "getDocumentBase", "Setup", look at the example 
	conf files in the ./conf/ folder for more information.
</code></pre>
<p>There is also a debug mode which can be activated by sending in a second parameter, this will<br>
simply print to the command line some extra information, like the parameters being asked for.</p>
<p>The current examples can be ran with the following commands(replace ; with : in *nix):</p>
<p>java -cp .;./bin/ com.cherokee.Cherokee ./conf/test.conf<br>
java -cp .;./bin/ com.cherokee.Cherokee ./conf/rs2.conf<br>
java -cp .;./bin/ com.cherokee.Cherokee ./conf/rsc.conf</p>
<p>todo:</p>
<p>-Implement an event triggered Scripting system to be ran in the same thread as the main<br>
application, perhaps triggered to be processed by bytecode injected method calls.<br>
-Perhaps allow more modifiers to be sent with mouse presses, such as ctrl, alt, and shift.<br>
-There are also few various todo:'s scattered around the source code that need attention.</p>
<p>Changelog:</p>
<p>Version 0.1b<br>
First public release. Far from a finished product.[/quote]</p>
<p>You can download this either in a prepackaged .zip form or by checking out from the svn from:<br>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cherokee/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://sourceforge.net/projects/cherokee/</a></p>
<p>This is as you see a very early beta, and not a finished product.  I ask for any and all suggestions I can get on my structure, implementation, or anything really.  The part that I worked very hard on and tested very thoroughly is the contents of the com.cherokee.event package, with the tester app I wrote I made sure every input was identical to human input, not leaving out the slightest detail, if anyone has suggestions for it, or sees where it could be detectable, please let me know.</p>
<p>When the actual structure of the bot is very solid, I will be working on an updater for RS2. The updater itself will probably be private, so as to be able to control the spread of the bot, but that has not been decided yet.</p>
<p>Lastly, if anyone would like to volunteer their time on either the programming of the bot or updater, I am looking for a dev team, so just volunteer. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thanks a lot, I am looking forward to a lively debate and many good suggestions. ;D</p>
