    <description>Exiled-Pk is a new 317 server which comes with everything you would want from a normal pserver. This server includes all of the basics such as: All Bosses, All Minigames, Auto Donation, Vote System, Skilling, and most importantly, a good Economy

First of all, can you please explain to me how this server is a 317? Or could anybody explain to me how these servers are allowed to be classified as “317s”?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Easy.</p>
<ol>
<li>They’re using the deobfuscated and renamed RuneScape client that was from revision 317.</li>
<li>They’re using a server that was built around the protocol of the 317 client (see <span class="hashtag">#1</span>)</li>
<li>Just because a person adds new data into the cache, it does not change the protocol.</li>
<li>9/10 times when they add new data into the cache, it’s “converted down” to the 317 format (Newer models and maps and shit have different data that the 317 client never had)</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the servers are typically called a “317 loading X data”. But some people just call it a 317 because it still is one.</p>
<p>And this is one hell of a leech…<br>

<p>Other than that, you say that your server has the basics, but you don’t say what else your server entails which leads me to believe your server is nothing different or unique.<br>
It makes me think this server was leeched, and maybe the name and a few teles were changed, because i’ve seen media like yours on, almost literally, millions of threads.[/quote]</p>
