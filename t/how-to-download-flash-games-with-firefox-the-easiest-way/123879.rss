    <title>How to Download Flash Games with FireFox (THE EASIEST WAY!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-download-flash-games-with-firefox-the-easiest-way/123879</link>
    <description>Ok, i&#39;ve seen two topics already on how to download a flash game, and neither of them have been &quot;easy&quot;, so i&#39;m writing a guide with two ways to get them.


[u][b]FF Page Info Way[/b][/u]

Ok first off, you must be using firefox for this. you might be able to use internet explorer; i wouldn&#39;t know because i haven&#39;t used internet explorer in years. 

Second, lets navigate to our desired game. I am using AddictingGames.com&#39;s Impossible quiz for this example.

ok, after you are on the page of your game, go up to &quot;[u]T[/u]ools&gt;Page Info&quot; in firefox

[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m89/ghostboy195/tools-pageinfo.jpg[/img]

Ok, now that you have Page Info open, navigate over to the Media Tab

[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m89/ghostboy195/pageinfo-mediatab.jpg[/img]

Look through the list until you see something in the type catagory as &quot;Embed&quot;. This is the flash game.

[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m89/ghostboy195/pageinfo-embed.jpg[/img]

Now, highlight it by clicking on it and then look near the bottom of the Page Info Window and you should see a button that says &quot;Save As...

[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m89/ghostboy195/pageinfo-saveasbutton.jpg[/img]

After you have clicked on it, navigate to the place that you want to save your flash game to. i have made a special folder for flashgames, you might want to do the same. Also, you will want to rename the game to the actual name of the game instead of the numbers.

[u][b]Opening and Playing the Game[/b][/u]

Ok, now that you have downloaded the game, you now want to play it right? Well here&#39;s how:


Navigate to the folder that you downloaded your game to. Mine is located in My Documents &gt; Flash Games. Next, you can open it with firefox, or you can open it with an swf opener. i&#39;ll show you how to open it with firefox for simplicities sake: 

Right click on the swf file and click &quot;Open With...&quot;

[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m89/ghostboy195/openwith.jpg[/img]

Now, in the list, scroll down and choose firefox to open it.

[IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m89/ghostboy195/openwithlist.jpg[/img]

Now highlight firefox by clicking on it and then check the box if you always want to use firefox to open it. Then click OK and the game will open in a new tap in firefox! Yay :D you just downloaded a flash game and learned how to use it
