    <title>My IP is messed up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-ip-is-messed-up/252847</link>
    <description>I know what is wrong with my server problem that I have been stumped by for a while, and it is my IP.  I can ping my IP perfectly, while others cant and it seems like it does not exist.  How would I fix this problem?  Just for tests, my IP is 67.191.254.68 for tests, but Im not sure why no one except me can ping it.  If any of you know how you would fix this, please help.  Thanks.</description>

              <p>as u said that ping tests how long for it to connect you ur server why would anyone else want to test how long it takes all they care about is connecting to it nothing else ive never heard of ping before and tbh i dont even think it matters</p>

<p>Hey, I have had similar trouble, and I have tried getting my server to work on 4 different computers, the only thing these computers had in common was my ISP(centurytel). So I figured that was the problem, also centurytel does not block the port I use, I had also assuming it has something to do with my modem, but I tried disabling the firewalls… Didn’t work either, sorry I couldn’t help more, but mainly just posting to tell all those morons to shut up, and that I do not think it’s your IP that is the problem, but perhaps your ISP/Modem.</p>

How did you get yours to finally work?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 27, 2008, 11:23:44 am[/size][hr]Nevermind, I got it working.  At first it was an IP and modem/ISP problem, but after I talked to them it was a port problem so I just used the utorrent method.[/quote]</p>

<p>No, when I first posted this topic it was an IP problem, but after I talked to my ISP it turned into a port problem, so were both wrong at certain times.</p>
