    <description>Hello, i have recently been downloading server&#39;s source&#39;s and client&#39;s from Moparscape. just yesterday i was having a problem running the sources. every time i ran them, they would say. server loading,.....then some other things and then they would say server already in use. i have my own server, 508 Hamachi. i played it everyday and coded everyday. it had to be perfect. well i ran the source to that client to, and same thing. server is already in use. something Ive been working on for 4 months now. just got ruined. so if you can please get back to me on what i need to do and how to do it, that would be great. thanks :D _ lilrockr13</description>

              <p>Have you tried rebooting your computer, or closing any programs that may be using port 43594? there are some applications that use the port such as music players, torrents etc, you can also change the port of the client and server to 5555 (I doubt you wanna do that though :P), as I said a little way up in my post, try rebooting your computer and look for programs that may be using the port 43594.</p>
<p>OR you can try changing your server port to 5555 etc.</p>
