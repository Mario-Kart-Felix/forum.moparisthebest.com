    <description>[u][b]LONG POST ALERT[/b][/u]


Yea to kick it off.. had to get up on Saturday morning after 1 and a half hours sleep to travel down to Birmingham.

Why you may ask?

Well 2 of my mates were in the National final for champions league poker... Its a 2 day tournament with around 300 players.
I went down for a weekend away from work and to support them.

we had a laugh on the way down, Driving past various funny cars including a bright Pink car driven by an old man.. 

[u][b]VIDEO:[/b][/u]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOLJLcOIXSA

(the driver is Stewart the guy with glasses is sweeny and the guy that says &quot;we look like tourists&quot; is Chris. LOL at sweenys chinese impression just before i put the cam to the side)

We stayed on Hagley road (the road that the pope was going through) at a shitty hotel called the Apollo hotel.

Anyway one of my mates got knocked out within 45 minutes AK vs pocket 5&#39;s and the 5&#39;s held.

So we took the car down to Riley&#39;s snooker hall in center of Birmingham.. Played 14 games of UK pool (12 of which i kicked his arse at) and then Chris, who was still in the tournament rang up saying that day 1 had finished and asked us to pick him up.. We found it funny cause everyone else in Rileys was Chinese.. we were playing pool upstairs and this dude was standing on the stairs on the phone and all we heard was &quot;WAAA... WAAA&quot; Was really funny.

Anyway i had downloaded TOMTOM UK-Ireland for my iphone. Yea.. lol it was shit.. we were only about 2 miles away from star city complex where the casino was.. it first said 3 miles.. Then it took us to a completly different place.. we asked a taxi driver where to go and he litterly gave us 5 minutes of instructions and was like.. &quot;Got that?&quot; so we turned round and was like &quot;err yea&quot;
so then i had to get the post code of the net.. entered it in the sat nav.. 4 miles.. next thing we know where on the M6 motorway driving straight past the casino (satnav still said 3 miles) we go into a huge junction and we miss our turning.. the 3 miles turns into 13.5 miles. so what should have taken us about 15 min took us an hour and a half. (all the time.Chris&#39;s Girlfriend was waiting outside the hotel) 

So we get back to the hotel.. and me and the Stewart (the one that was knocked out early) Left chris at the hotel with his girlfriend to get down to business.. We went to a steak house and spent £41 on a meal.. (we was supposed to pay £41.57 but i didn&#39;t have change so we walked out)

Later that night we were in &quot;the figure of eight&quot; which is a whetherspoons bar. Chris and his girlfriend were making out and me and Stu was talking, we were supposed to be joined by chris&#39;s girlfriends mates but they decided not to come.. Me and Stu didn&#39;t really fancy sitting and watching Chris and his girlfriend constantly making out so we stood outside.. 

It was literally like men and motors outside.. withing half an hour there must have been at least £500,000 worth of cars drive past.. BMW M6&#39;s and allsorts.. the highlight of which being a Merc AMG in full chrome. looked sweet.

So we ended up walking back to the hotel.

Next day we get to the casino okay and in time for the kickoff of the second day of the tournament.. 80 players left blinds at 500/1000 and my mates sitting on 10k.. Not good.

I decide to play a £16.50 freeze-out sit n go.. (20 seats and anyone after 20 were put on alternate seats meaning when someone got knocked out they got put in.. this only happened up to the break)

I was doing pretty shit.. got down to 475 chips with the blinds at 100/200 i get to under the gun and i had pocket Q&#39;s.. i go all in.. get called by 2 people.

Flop comes 6 6 6 .. I&#39;m thinking right I&#39;m looking good here ... Turn comes 6.. I&#39;m thinking oh shit.. quads with a Q kicker not looking so good now.. river comes a 10.

Everyone turns over their cards... J10 vs 55 vs my QQ.. so i tripled up to about 1500..

Long story short on that tournament.. i go heads up with a really cute chick.. were about equal.. there&#39;s some raising and re-raising by me and i get just above her.

Next hand i get A8 blinds at 1000/2000 i raise to 4000.. she calls.. the flop comes AA2.. Now this is where i was surprised.. i was like ERR ERR check (couldn&#39;t help shake) and she raised 3000.. i call, Turn comes a 7.. i check and she raised 3000, i call and the river comes a 5.. she immediately bets out of turn 3000, i think for about 10 seconds and announce &quot;re-raise another 9000&quot; she counts her chips and she has exactly 9k left.. &quot;fuck it i call&quot; i turn and say i have the A and she replies &quot;oh shit&quot; she had K5.

I come first and win £150..

I play some 3 card pocket and come off £35 up from £20.. so i took away £55..

i check on my mate who&#39;s still in the national, he somehow made it to the last 2 tables and is now sitting on 220k with 1.4million in play and 20 players.. so he&#39;s not doing so bad.. next thing a guy comes over to me and asks me if i want to play another sit n go.. i say yes.. 

I win that one too and come away with £90.. Total winnings for me was £290 during the day.

Chris ends up coming 6th in the national and wins a 16gb Ipad worth £420


We set off home at 8:30pm on Sunday (after thinking we was gonna be setting off around 2pm) 

Were driving on the motorway, its pretty quiet. Chris is falling asleep.. so i quietly tell Stewart and his mate &quot;Sweeny&quot; when Chris is asleep we should brake hard and everyone shout at once and watch what Chris does... 5 minutes later we do.. Chris&#39;s face was awesome.. Such a fun laugh.

I get home around 11:30pm and fall asleep ready for work Monday afternoon.


Pictures from the weekend:

And finally.. this is what was awaiting us as we left the hotel on sunday morning. All the police awaiting the pope.

There were wayyy more down the road too.

<p>we play all the time lol… last game i had with him we were playing a £2.50 rebuy and you could rebuy as many times as you want for 3 hours and then it stopped… but at the end you could buy an add-on for another £2.50… Total i spent that night was £5…</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">LONG POST ALERT</span></span></p>
<p>Yea to kick it off… had to get up on Saturday morning after 1 and a half hours sleep to travel down to Birmingham.</p>
<p>Why you may ask?</p>
<p>Well 2 of my mates were in the National final for champions league poker… Its a 2 day tournament with around 300 players.<br>
I went down for a weekend away from work and to support them.</p>
<p>we had a laugh on the way down, Driving past various funny cars including a bright Pink car driven by an old man…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">VIDEO:</span></span><br>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="eOLJLcOIXSA" data-youtube-title="" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div></p>
<p>(the driver is Stewart the guy with glasses is sweeny and the guy that says “we look like tourists” is Chris. LOL at sweenys chinese impression just before i put the cam to the side)</p>
<p>We stayed on Hagley road (the road that the pope was going through) at a shitty hotel called the Apollo hotel.</p>
<p>Anyway one of my mates got knocked out within 45 minutes AK vs pocket 5’s and the 5’s held.</p>
<p>So we took the car down to Riley’s snooker hall in center of Birmingham… Played 14 games of UK pool (12 of which i kicked his arse at) and then Chris, who was still in the tournament rang up saying that day 1 had finished and asked us to pick him up… We found it funny cause everyone else in Rileys was Chinese… we were playing pool upstairs and this dude was standing on the stairs on the phone and all we heard was “WAAA… WAAA” Was really funny.</p>
<p>Anyway i had downloaded TOMTOM UK-Ireland for my iphone. Yea… lol it was shit… we were only about 2 miles away from star city complex where the casino was… it first said 3 miles… Then it took us to a completly different place… we asked a taxi driver where to go and he litterly gave us 5 minutes of instructions and was like… “Got that?” so we turned round and was like “err yea”<br>
so then i had to get the post code of the net… entered it in the sat nav… 4 miles… next thing we know where on the M6 motorway driving straight past the casino (satnav still said 3 miles) we go into a huge junction and we miss our turning… the 3 miles turns into 13.5 miles. so what should have taken us about 15 min took us an hour and a half. (all the time.Chris’s Girlfriend was waiting outside the hotel)</p>
<p>So we get back to the hotel… and me and the Stewart (the one that was knocked out early) Left chris at the hotel with his girlfriend to get down to business… We went to a steak house and spent £41 on a meal… (we was supposed to pay £41.57 but i didn’t have change so we walked out)</p>
<p>Later that night we were in “the figure of eight” which is a whetherspoons bar. Chris and his girlfriend were making out and me and Stu was talking, we were supposed to be joined by chris’s girlfriends mates but they decided not to come… Me and Stu didn’t really fancy sitting and watching Chris and his girlfriend constantly making out so we stood outside…</p>
<p>It was literally like men and motors outside… withing half an hour there must have been at least £500,000 worth of cars drive past… BMW M6’s and allsorts… the highlight of which being a Merc AMG in full chrome. looked sweet.</p>
<p>So we ended up walking back to the hotel.</p>
<p>Next day we get to the casino okay and in time for the kickoff of the second day of the tournament… 80 players left blinds at 500/1000 and my mates sitting on 10k… Not good.</p>
<p>I decide to play a £16.50 freeze-out sit n go… (20 seats and anyone after 20 were put on alternate seats meaning when someone got knocked out they got put in… this only happened up to the break)</p>
<p>I was doing pretty shit… got down to 475 chips with the blinds at 100/200 i get to under the gun and i had pocket Q’s… i go all in… get called by 2 people.</p>
<p>Flop comes 6 6 6 … I’m thinking right I’m looking good here … Turn comes 6… I’m thinking oh shit… quads with a Q kicker not looking so good now… river comes a 10.</p>
<p>Everyone turns over their cards… J10 vs 55 vs my QQ… so i tripled up to about 1500…</p>
<p>Long story short on that tournament… i go heads up with a really cute chick… were about equal… there’s some raising and re-raising by me and i get just above her.</p>
<p>Next hand i get A8 blinds at 1000/2000 i raise to 4000… she calls… the flop comes AA2… Now this is where i was surprised… i was like ERR ERR check (couldn’t help shake) and she raised 3000… i call, Turn comes a 7… i check and she raised 3000, i call and the river comes a 5… she immediately bets out of turn 3000, i think for about 10 seconds and announce “re-raise another 9000” she counts her chips and she has exactly 9k left… “fuck it i call” i turn and say i have the A and she replies “oh shit” she had K5.</p>
<p>I come first and win £150…</p>
<p>I play some 3 card pocket and come off £35 up from £20… so i took away £55…</p>
<p>i check on my mate who’s still in the national, he somehow made it to the last 2 tables and is now sitting on 220k with 1.4million in play and 20 players… so he’s not doing so bad… next thing a guy comes over to me and asks me if i want to play another sit n go… i say yes…</p>
<p>I win that one too and come away with £90… Total winnings for me was £290 during the day.</p>
<p>Chris ends up coming 6th in the national and wins a 16gb Ipad worth £420</p>
<p>We set off home at 8:30pm on Sunday (after thinking we was gonna be setting off around 2pm)</p>
<p>Were driving on the motorway, its pretty quiet. Chris is falling asleep… so i quietly tell Stewart and his mate “Sweeny” when Chris is asleep we should brake hard and everyone shout at once and watch what Chris does… 5 minutes later we do… Chris’s face was awesome… Such a fun laugh.</p>
<p>I get home around 11:30pm and fall asleep ready for work Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Pictures from the weekend:</p>
<p>Bright pink car:<br>

<p>And finally… this is what was awaiting us as we left the hotel on sunday morning. All the police awaiting the pope.<br>
