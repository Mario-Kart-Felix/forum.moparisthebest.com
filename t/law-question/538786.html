        <p>So me and two other friends were walking around my neighborhood at maybe 10 in the morning. We had just got done running because we are all on sports teams. Anyways we walked to the neighborhood right next to mine and we were looking at some of the houses. We saw a foreclosed house, and you could tell NOBODY lived there, so all 3 of us went into the backyard just to check it out. A mailman saw us open the gate and go back there and I guess he called the police(It didn’t hit me that he called the cops until after this whole incident). At this point, I knew we were trespassing, but I didn’t really think anything of it, because it was seriously not a big deal at all. We just went back there to look at the pool because it was really dirty. We were back there for about 5 minutes, and when we came back out to the front of the house I saw the mailman in the exact same spot he was when we first went into the backyard. We walked to the sidewalk and he drove away and we all walked away, he didn’t say a word to us the entire time. We walked to a public lake and we were just chilling around the lake. We were at the lake for about 1 minute before we see 3 cop cars pull up and 3 cops come over to talk to us. We were about 50 yards away from the road, right beside the lake and they started walking to us and we made our way towards them. They immediately told us to keep our hands out of our pockets and patted as down. After they were done patting us down they asked us what we were doing and we told them we were just looking around the neighborhood. One of my friends was still really sweaty from when we were running and one of the cops starts trying to make us nervous. He started saying stuff like “OH why are you so sweaty, are you nervous?”, “Were you all smoking weed”, “Where did you throw the blunts(This was kind of jokingly said but idk its skeptical to ask that)”. We told them we had just got done running. Anyway after they asked us a bunch of questions about where we went to school, ect, ect. They asked us for our names and our addresses and they wrote it down. We gave them our correct information and everything being as nice as possible. After that they told us to get up and walked us to their police cars. Once we got their they pulled out papers and made us tell them our address AGAIN, phone number AGAIN, full name AGAIN, and we even had to give them our finger prints. Once we filled out that paper work we were free to go because we didn’t have any drugs or anything illegal on us. All we did was trespass on a foreclosed house.</p>
<p>Anyway… so my question is what was this paperwork he asked us to fill out? Also, will this be on my record or something? I’m 17 years old and I don’t want something so small and stupid to be messing with my future.</p>
<p>Also, the whole encounter was pretty friendly, the cops were nice besides one of them being kind of a douchebag, and all 3 of us were very nice and cooperative with them.</p>

<p>Hmm. That’s weird.</p>
<p>Unless there was some sort of incident involving some type of misconduct somewhere, and they pulled your prints to ensure you weren’t involved with some type of incident where they pulled prints from the scene.</p>
<p>Basically, you should not have consented to anything, unless you were being detained.</p>
<p>The only way they could use that information on you is if the prints match records of some sort of crime committed.</p>
<p>The paperwork they filled out was most likely either a police report, or an incident report.</p>

<p>We’re pretty good kids. The small trespassing was the only thing we did. I’ve also never committed a crime in the past.</p>
<p>It probably was an incident report. Are incident reports no big deal?</p>

</aside>
<p>You’ve got nothing to worry about as long as you have no outstanding warrants or are linked to another crime.</p>
<p>Incident reports have to be filled out ANY time an officer communicates with a pedestrian, wether it be questioning them or citing them.<br>

<p>Alright thanks a lot.</p>
<p>I just thought it was weird that they had to get all 10 fingerprints.[/quote]</p>
<p>Like I said, something probably happened in the neighborhood that they pulled prints off from and they are just comparing your prints to those prints. Do you live in a big(ish) city? If so that’s it. If not, still nothing to worry about otherwise they would have instantly detained you.</p>

No, you have no idea what you are talking about.</p>
<p>The cops were conducting an investigation. To them, they received a call regarding a possible burglary and you fit the description of the potential suspects. When they start talking to you, they are conducting an investigation. At this point they have the right to ask for your info(Many states also have laws they law enforcement can just ask you for an ID for no reason legally…as well without any suspicion of a crime). They are doing this to verify that who you say you are is correct and that you don’t have any upstanding warrants. Since the officers made contact with you, they also have to fill out an incident report with your info and what happened. As for the fingerprints, it is most likely added to a database because the offers didn’t know your intentions with the house. That just means if you commit a crime now and your fingerprints are left behind, your screwed.</p>

<p>An officer is not required to ask for information either without a warrant. You still own the right to say absolutely nothing to them. What will this do? They don’t get jack ---- information from you. Then the investigation becomes purely hearsay.</p>
<p>Guess what? Two years of having several friends in the law enforcement field.</p>
<p>In the state of GA the ONLY time you are required to give any information what so ever is when you are detained/officially under arrest for a reason ( i.e. you may be in a traffic accident they will need your ID and registration) Even then, they are not going to fingerprint you…</p>

That is true if they were just walking down the street. They did break a law though so would be required to hand over their license, if asked for it. Refusal to cooperate with police never really works out to your advantage either, especially if you have nothing to hide. All you will do is make the suspicious. It is this kind of arrogance that makes cops act the way they do. Just because you saw it in a YouTube video doesn’t make it true.<br>
also know Game Warden’s have more rights to search you and your property than the police do. They do not need a warrant to enter land with a no-trespassing sign.</p>
