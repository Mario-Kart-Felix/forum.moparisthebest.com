<p>Do you just always just assume everything? If I thought it was bad then I would just say it’s bad, don’t play it.[/quote]<br>
Not fun = bad because games exist for pleasure? Games are meant to be fun. I do assume things a lot though, considering a post doesn’t tell you enough information a lot of the time &amp; it’s not like a real conversation so I can’t ask without waiting a couple minute (or longer) pause; it’d be stupid not to assume although I am still right and you are still an idiot.</p>

              <p>I don’t like the look of some of the features ingame like the whole tilting sliding thing, environment noises being super loud (I like how cod isn’t realistic…) and so on. Otherwise it looks like a new mw3 so I’ll probably really like it. I won’t like it as much as I do mw3 but I’ll play it rather than mw3 probably purely because of the match making cough and new technology should improve some of the glitchy gameplay.</p>

I just don’t like CoD in general. It’s too mainstream (way too many little kids playing) and it’s horribly managed, the developers barely care about it after they release it besides throwing out pre-made maps for $20. Another thing that bugs me is having sidebar videos on YouTube with titles like “Quick-scope fakey 360 grannyslam 900 u won’t believe it!!!.” I will agree it is fun, I’ve hopped on MW2 a few times with friends for a few games, but I haven’t bought the last two releases and I don’t plan on buying the next ones. MW3 killed the franchise for me and I don’t ever plan on buying another.</p>
<p>When I play XBOX it’s generally campaign games (Bioshock Infinite is an A+ game) or Battlefield 3. I won’t turn this into a BF VS. CoD topic, but one of the reasons I love BF3 is that DICE actually patches and balances. They have many more mechanics to balance than CoD does anyway, but that’s where I stand.<br>

<p>Black Ops 1 Ruined it for me as well. I did buy bo2 and liked it until all the little kids started playing all the time. My heart will always be with Modern Warfare 2 and World at war.</p>

<p>Anyway, the reason people complain about CoD is that people are literally bullied for not playing such games (happened to me many times; I don’t mean beaten up, but definitely victimized). Making fun of the game, as one would, is simply the logical retaliation.</p>

Activision doesn’t develop the games, they just publish them. Also read the bottom of the case <a href="http://b-i.forbesimg.com/johngaudiosi/files/2013/05/Call-of-Duty-Ghosts-1.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, says Infinity Ward.</p>

Why people still babble and whine about people who buy this game is beyond me, it’s been 3 years since the babbling started? Why, just why not, get the love over the fact that people want to use their money for something that you may not, if you don’t like Call of Duty then I will respect that but I would expect vice verse, not some text war mongler preaching to everyone why not to buy the best selling game every year, keyword “best selling.”<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Your last three words make you sound very hypocritical. It’s only best selling because of the millions of prepubescent kids that don’t know what else to play that would make them kool at skool.[/quote]<br>
Well actually myself, I tend to not let anyone at school play Call of Duty with me. No clue where you’re heading with that theory.</p>
