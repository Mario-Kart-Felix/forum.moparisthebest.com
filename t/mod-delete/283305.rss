    <description>I downloaded someones halo energy sword as a .dat. I put it in the model editing software and made a version laying down for a wield model and exported it and made it into a dat as well. I then gziped the files and named them 12050 and 12051(wield model) I put them in my model folder for my client. I then went to class 8 and added this code
[code]if(i == 8001) {
class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;//New option
class8.anInt174 = 12051; //Model ID //
class8.anInt181 = 2000; //zoom increase will make it smaller
class8.anInt190 = 572; //model rotate up+down increase to move doen away from you
class8.anInt198 = 0; //model rotate side ways increase to move right in circle
class8.anInt169 = 25; // model offset increase to move to the right
class8.anInt194 = 1; //model offset increase to move up
class8.anInt165 = 12050;//male wearing
class8.anInt200 = 12050;//female wearing
class8.anInt164 = -1;//Female arms/sleeves
class8.anInt188 = -1;//male arms/sleeves
class8.aBoolean176 = false;//Stackable
class8.aString170 = &quot;Halo Energy Sword&quot;;//Name of the new item
class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;Slash your way through the covenant.. I mean Lesser Demons :D&quot;.getBytes();//examin info[/code]
Idk if thats right  but I put it right after a 3629 numbered one. I dont know if Im supposed to label it higher or not. I just no when I g into my client I added both models and I typed in ::pickup 8000 1. It came up with a small item that is a null and it gives me an error.

I dont know what to do please help me

Oh and in the Dat Making thing I did set the wielded model to 10 and right hand. and for the other i set it to 10 and no anim</description>

              <p>ok for one thing your modelâ€™s are backwards. So your wield model is being set as drop model, and drop model as wield.</p>
