    <title>Habbo Private Server - Port Forwarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/habbo-private-server-port-forwarding/134734</link>
    <description>I have a Habbo Private Server and It works on my computer locally with a local address of 127.0.0.1 and a local router address of 192.168.0.2. I need to set up port forwarding on my router for port 1232 but when I do it, it doesn&#39;t work on other computers. I have put it onto a website but only my computer can use it. Could you please let me know how to overcome this problem and how to set up port forwarding properly on my router. My router is a wired netgear router if that helps. :confused: :confused: :confused:

EDIT: I have tried google, and i have read the manual for the router and it will not work properly and was asking to see if anyone could tell me what to do.</description>
