    <title>Server vs normal computer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-vs-normal-computer/204439</link>
    <description>Hey, I was looking into getting a dedicated computer for runescape autoing (don&#39;t talk about it).  Looked into server mobos and regular mobos, regular are cheaper, but only 1 cpu then.  Would windows server OS make use of say 8 cores (2xquad cores), or do that &quot;assign process to core&quot; thing through task manager?  I read that server mobos are designed so that there are no bottlenecks, everything runs smoothly, but I&#39;ve found this wacko awesome board, the Gigabyte 780g, with the fastest fsb out there, 2600mhz, and I was thinking that would also be a smokin&#39; board to run a AMD quad core, but, because its still a &quot;home&quot; use mobo, would it still bottleneck if it was running at max cpu and ram usage all the time?  Also, servers used are pretty cheap (proportionally), so anyways, rather, cheap-to-build computer out of &quot;home-cost&quot; parts, or a rather expensive server that is known to run cpu intensive programs for prolonged periods of time?  I have enough parts at home to make a rather good server for under $300 if I use home parts, probably above $1000 for server parts.
Anyways, thanks.
EDIT: also, I read up a bit, and I read that the core duo cycles (??) faster than the Pentium D (dual core), the Pentium D is MUCH cheaper and can offer more GHZ/$, but will the duo still do more because it does more faster (just less quantity?), or would it be the Pentium D run more, at worse framerate (doesn&#39;t cycle through fast enough?)</description>

<p>The Q6600 is a quad core, way out core2duo’s league.</p>
<p>Slightly off topic, but I’ve managed to get 10 or so bots running on my laptop, 2GB of ram and a 1.8ghz Amd Turion 64 processor, my desktop has 4GB of ram and a Q6600(not even one of the best core2quad’s) and while I haven’t autoing on runescape on it, I’m sure it can handle more than 20.</p>

<p>Sorry for wrong section, and yes, I know they generally use a different OS, but if you use Windows Server edition, couldn’t you run SCAR or that impsoft bot or whatever?  Also, can you run it in linux?  Also, Xeon cpu’s have a 12 mb cache vs 4, would this affect performance noticeably or what?  And yes, you did answer my question, just I would appreciate if you actually told me why. (although I just noticed P4 FSB speeds are 2/3 that of duo).  Plus, I’m sure there are differences, or everyone would use micro mobos in their servers and not have any problems.</p>

</aside>
<p>For the shit your trying to do, you need ram more than anything. The RuneScape client is a total ram whore, along with a bot it would eat up even more unless the bot removed some of the clients inefficiencies. If you plan to run multiple bots at the same time, then you’re going to want more cores. I’d say 2 bots per core per 512mb of ram. So if you want to run 8 bots, get 4 cores and 4gb of ram.<br>
Most (hopefully all) Java bots can run under Linux, but SCAR is written in Delphi. You could use WINE to run it, but if you’re really serious about botting, just find something that runs natively.</p>
