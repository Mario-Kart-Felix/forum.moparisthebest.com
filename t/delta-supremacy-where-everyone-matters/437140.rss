    <description>[center][b]Introduction:[/b][/center]
[tt]Hello moparscape and welcome to the [b]Supremacy[/b] development thread. I am using Delta as my base. Believe me, if I thought I wouldn&#39;t get anywhere with this development, I wouldn&#39;t be wasting my time. I think with a little hard work and patience, I could make something great out of Delta. Anyways, I started this project back in November of 2011 and I took a break (family problems) but now i&#39;m back, and I am hard at work. I will have updates posted on a daily basis. As of now, I am working on rewriting some of the skills. My main goal is to make Delta as stable as possible. I know this will take alot of work/time, but I am sticking with this project no matter what.[/tt]

[center][b]Future updates/goals:[/b][/center]
[tt]I only have 2 main goals as of now, they consist of rewriting every skill and cleaning out every class file to make this project as stable as possible. I know what you&#39;re thinking, &quot;Delta being stable? haha!&quot; Well, as I have said, I believe I can achieve this as time progresses.[/tt]

[center][b]Skills:[/b][/center]
R[tt]ight now, I have the basic skills, but I am working on rewriting all of them with the correct level requirments, etc.
At this point in time, combat is the most important to me. As most of you know, Delta&#39;s combat system isn&#39;t all that great. My goal is to perfect it. I will post pictures in the near future.[/tt]
