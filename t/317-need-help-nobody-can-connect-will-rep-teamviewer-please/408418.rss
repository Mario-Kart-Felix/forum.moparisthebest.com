    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-need-help-nobody-can-connect-will-rep-teamviewer-please/408418</link>
    <description>Before I rant on my problem.. I will start out by saying TeamViewer is your best bet at helping my in this problem. So please help via that way if possible.

I HAVE FOLLOWED COUNTLESS TUTORIALS IN WHICH NONE WORKED. PEOPLE STILL GET AND ERROR WHEN TRYING TO CONNECT.

Reply on here is available to help!

-Now-

I have ran a server before on my own... it took forever to start up due to the fact that nobody could join although canyouseeme.org said 43594 was opened. I used uTorrent and No-IP&#39;s DUC as a combination to have people connect, once I finally got it. Well, now I have the same problem and can&#39;t remember what I did to fix it. Canyouseeme.org said 43594 was opened (ONLY WHEN uTORRENT IS OPENED), when it was closed uTorrent was also closed. 
What I&#39;m trying to say is that my server wont let anybody on it. Moparscape&#39;s status checker said it was &quot;ONLINE&quot; but I am trying to connect and cannot, even from their webclient on 127.0.0.1. I have the source set up to my No-IP and it was running when I tested it every time. So, I need somebody to help via Teamviewer to show me what I&#39;m doing wrong in startup or setup.. THANKS FOR READING THIS!!!</description>
