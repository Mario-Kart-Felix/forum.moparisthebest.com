        <p>Recently I was looking at the high alch charts that yielded the most profit because I figured I would alch these items for profit.</p>
<p>The highest item was a royal shirt which the ge was selling for 58k and high alch was 60k so I put in 100 offers for 58500 and got 8 by the next morning (today).</p>
<p>Today they are worth 59000 and I figured since my magic on my main was only 5 that I would just sell to get the money back.</p>
<p>I put in individual offers for each at the ge guide price. First one sold for 350k!!! Second one sold for the guide price…Third one sold for 164,000 and the next two were for guide prices. That was like a profit of a half a million in a matter of seconds on accident?</p>
<p>Can anyone explain why this happened? Just rich people not caring how much they spent on items and buying it for outrageous prices due to market shortages?</p>

<p>It’s possible(and I do it often) to buy items overnight for 1-10 gp when their trade price is 400-500, and sell them for the guide price the next day. It’s just because there’s no market for them at certain hours and at others there is.[/quote]</p>
<p>Sweet well I set the remaining ones to 100k and I had to wait 5 hours but I eventually got 100k for both of them. I guess I can just buy items on the high alch list while they are low and then sell them back at 2x 3x the price because many people will be trying to buy for the low price for alching and the people that actually need it are willing to pay more like Miss Silabsoft said…I guess this is the idea behind merching then?</p>
