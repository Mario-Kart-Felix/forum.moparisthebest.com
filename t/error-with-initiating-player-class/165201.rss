    <title>Error With Initiating Player Class</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-with-initiating-player-class/165201</link>
    <description>Okay when I try initiate the Player class in my PacketBuilder class it says that Player is abstract and cannot be instanced.
I was wondering how I cauld assign Player to somthing to stop this or how to get around this so I can initiate Player in
PacketHandler. This is what I mean by initiating:
[code]
Player plr = null;
plr = new Player();
[/code]

If anyone cauld help me with this it would be a life saver because if I don&#39;t initiate Player it will just keep returning NullPointerExceptions.

Thankyou.
