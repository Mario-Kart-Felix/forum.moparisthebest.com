Before I start talking about this amazing network I&#39;ve got to say this: [B]UK RESIDENTS ONLY[/B]
Right, now that&#39;s out of the way I can tell you all about it.

[U][B]What is GiffGaff?[/B][/U]
You&#39;ve probably never heard of it, so you&#39;ll probably be asking that question. It is a mobile phone network. [B]Ran on o2&#39;s signal[/B].

[U][B]Price[/B][/U]
This is probably what will swing you to join.
You&#39;ve got two choices. Goodybags and normal PAYG.

[B][I]The GoodyBags[/I][/B] (and a quick comparison vs big networks)
[URL=http://&quot;http://giffgaff.com/orders/affiliate/mumups&quot;][IMG]http://i43.tinypic.com/6dzte1.png[/img][/URL]
What do you think of that?

[B]UNLIMITED [/B]internet
[B]UNLIMITED[/B] texts &lt;--- £10 a month.
250 MINS

I dont know about you, but that is an amazing deal. (You&#39;re not allowed to tether though)
That beats A [B]LOT[/B] of contracts, and here&#39;s the best thing - you can leave ANYTIME YOU WANT. No contracts, no hassle.

[B][I]Normal Pay As You Go[/I][/B]
[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/e6srhf.png[/img]

20p a day for internet. Lets take a look at Vodafone (which I moved from), WHAT? £2 a day for internet!? You will be getting a much [B]better[/B] deal here at giffgaff than most other networks. I guarantee it.

[B][U]Why is giffgaff so cheap[/U][/B]
You must be thinking there&#39;s a catch here. Well there is, if you can call it one. You see giffgaff keeps costs down by [B]NOT HAVING CALL CENTRES[/B], but lets be honest here, how many of you have actually [B]NEEDED[/B] to call them before? I know I haven&#39;t.

Instead of call centres everything is done online, so if you need any help you can contact the &quot;agents&quot; online, and avoid having your time wasted. It&#39;s a quick and easy process. (No wasting your credit on waiting ages on call centres!)

There is also the support forums, ran by the members. [B]Here is where the &quot;ran by you&quot; slogan comes in[/B] basically if anyone needs help or has a problem they come to the support forums and ask their question. I&#39;m not exaggerating here, ask a question and it is answered almost [B]INSTANTLY[/B] by other members. If they can&#39;t help you, you go to the &quot;agents&quot;.

[B][U]Why do people sit on the forums all day answering questions and such?[/U][/B]
Here&#39;s probably another reason why you might want to join. Quite a big one actually.
Participate in their forums, and chat with other members, help out here and there and they [B]PAY YOU[/B]. Yup. You don&#39;t have to do much, for example last month I earned £10 from them from [B]LIGHT DISCUSSION[/B] and I emphasise the word &quot;[B]LIGHT[/B]&quot;

They Pay you through [B]PayPal[/B], [B]Phone Credit[/B], or it lets you just [B]donate your money to charity[/B]. :)

[IMG]http://i40.tinypic.com/2eo8g2t.png[/img]

I was shocked that I earned £10 last month, I didn&#39;t even do much. They pay you every 6 months I think, so you have time to let the money to accumulate.

[B]REFER ANOTHER MEMBER AND GET £5 TOWARDS PAYBACK[/B] - If you refer lots of members your in the big time haha ;). Lets say your family. maybe 3 people are in your family? that&#39;s [B]£15[/B] towards your chosen charity/Paypal/phone credit.

[B][U]Never heard of this network. Not going to trust it.[/U][/B]
Ok. It&#39;s quite small compared to most. However just to convince you they&#39;re worth it, I&#39;ve been a member for 3 months now and I haven&#39;t had a problem and they&#39;ve been around for a couple of years now.
Also I&#39;m sure a lot of you watch the Big Bang Theory?

Check out who&#39;s sponsoring them now :)

[IMG]http://www.thedrum.co.uk/uploads/drum_basic_article/89403/main_images/giffgaff.png[/img]

[B][U]After You&#39;ve got your Free sim card in the post.[/U][/B]
You have to activate it with £10 credit (sign up with my link and get an extra £5 after activation), give it some time to activate, and then stick it in your phone. Simple-as.

[B]YOU MUST HAVE AN UNLOCKED PHONE OR AN O2 LOCKED PHONE FOR THE SIM CARD TO WORK[/B]
Thought I&#39;d stick that in caps and in bold there, just to make sure you could see it :)

Well I don&#39;t know what else to say, oh yeah, they&#39;re online only - can&#39;t find sim cards in shops and must activate sim card online.
You can buy top up vouchers from newsagents etc like you normally would. Also O2 top up vouchers also work (but dont ring the o2 top up voucher)
If you don&#39;t like top up vouchers just use your credit/debit card online to top up.

Well that&#39;s it I think. Comment If you&#39;ve ordered a sim :), also if you need any help just ask :D
Remember signing up under me gives you an extra £5 credit and me an extra £5 credit too!

Shut down for what?<br>

<p>False advertising, they’ve been claiming unlimited for years[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s not false advertising, lots of “unlimited” internet packages for phones are far from unlimited. Hence my concerns, if it is unlimited though, very good. I’d be interested to know if anyone has exceeded a few gb though.</p>

              <p>Been using this for ages however, we have some issues: if you have your goodybag expire on the end of the month then you’re fucked im afraid as mine does that and the site always breaks for updating goodybags at the end of the every month. The other day was wank when that water pipe burst but not the networks fault, they’re good though and cheap so if you own a handset then go for it</p>

<p>Yeah, I must say it has it’s problems. If you’re going to join id recommend not porting your number, I’ve heard cases of people waiting days without service.</p>
<p>Although the network has been nothing but good for me so far.</p>
<p>Also I find this funny so Im going to say it<br>
Some people actually just use their forums for the money, and use it to pay contracts from other phone networks. Haha, it’s such a flawed system but it’s great for the users <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/above">@above</a> giffgaff is owned by Telefonica and therefore has the same signal and reliability of O2 - second largest network in the UK.<br>
Instead of call centres it’s done online, so there is customer support</p>
<p>Yes, you don’t NEED unlimited Internet and texts, but some people might like being able to watch HD videos and streams etc, and some people might have peace of mind knowing there’s no limit on their texts.</p>
<p>If you feel like you’ve got a better deal at tesco than you should stay there, I just posted this for people who might be seeking a better deal</p>
<p>Internet is unlimited for mobile use only</p>
<p>If you’re in the UK you’ll see giffgaff is sponsoring the big bang theory now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> its pretty cool lol</p>
<p>Also reason it’s cheap is because it’s a virtual mobile network, it hasn’t got call centres so that keeps down costs, and also the network is quite “green” (for example sim packaging is minimal)</p>
<p>Hope I cleared most of it up for you guys</p>

<p>Erm… well, if they weren’t needed they wouldn’t be there, I don’t see how having 0 technical support is a good thing, but OK. (I don’t count the online community because you can get support for anything on forums, that’s not some exclusive thing for GiffGaff).</p>
<p>EDIT: reread, so online “agents” are technical support? So my bad there, but still this just comes across as an advertisement of your referral link. There is <span class="bbcode-b">no</span> way it’s as good as you make it out to be, or it’d cost as much as any other network. Why does the word “bang” indicate they’re sponsored by a TV show  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

Before I start talking about this amazing network I’ve got to say this: <span class="bbcode-b">UK RESIDENTS ONLY</span><br>
Right, now that’s out of the way I can tell you all about it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">What is GiffGaff?</span></span><br>
You’ve probably never heard of it, so you’ll probably be asking that question. It is a mobile phone network. <span class="bbcode-b">Ran on o2’s signal</span>.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Price</span></span><br>
This is probably what will swing you to join.<br>
You’ve got two choices. Goodybags and normal PAYG.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">The GoodyBags</span></span> (and a quick comparison vs big networks)<br>
<a data-bbcode="true"><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/6dzte1.png" alt width="690" height="251"></a><br>
What do you think of that?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">UNLIMITED </span>internet<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">UNLIMITED</span> texts &lt;— £10 a month.<br>
250 MINS</p>
<p>I dont know about you, but that is an amazing deal. (You’re not allowed to tether though)<br>
That beats A <span class="bbcode-b">LOT</span> of contracts, and here’s the best thing - you can leave ANYTIME YOU WANT. No contracts, no hassle.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Normal Pay As You Go</span></span><br>
<img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/e6srhf.png" alt width="582" height="263"></p>
<p>20p a day for internet. Lets take a look at Vodafone (which I moved from), WHAT? £2 a day for internet!? You will be getting a much <span class="bbcode-b">better</span> deal here at giffgaff than most other networks. I guarantee it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Why is giffgaff so cheap</span></span><br>
You must be thinking there’s a catch here. Well there is, if you can call it one. You see giffgaff keeps costs down by <span class="bbcode-b">NOT HAVING CALL CENTRES</span>, but lets be honest here, how many of you have actually <span class="bbcode-b">NEEDED</span> to call them before? I know I haven’t.</p>
<p>Instead of call centres everything is done online, so if you need any help you can contact the “agents” online, and avoid having your time wasted. It’s a quick and easy process. (No wasting your credit on waiting ages on call centres!)</p>
<p>There is also the support forums, ran by the members. <span class="bbcode-b">Here is where the “ran by you” slogan comes in</span> basically if anyone needs help or has a problem they come to the support forums and ask their question. I’m not exaggerating here, ask a question and it is answered almost <span class="bbcode-b">INSTANTLY</span> by other members. If they can’t help you, you go to the “agents”.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Why do people sit on the forums all day answering questions and such?</span></span><br>
Here’s probably another reason why you might want to join. Quite a big one actually.<br>
Participate in their forums, and chat with other members, help out here and there and they <span class="bbcode-b">PAY YOU</span>. Yup. You don’t have to do much, for example last month I earned £10 from them from <span class="bbcode-b">LIGHT DISCUSSION</span> and I emphasise the word “<span class="bbcode-b">LIGHT</span>”</p>
<p>They Pay you through <span class="bbcode-b">PayPal</span>, <span class="bbcode-b">Phone Credit</span>, or it lets you just <span class="bbcode-b">donate your money to charity</span>. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/2eo8g2t.png" alt width="286" height="177"></p>
<p>I was shocked that I earned £10 last month, I didn’t even do much. They pay you every 6 months I think, so you have time to let the money to accumulate.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">REFER ANOTHER MEMBER AND GET £5 TOWARDS PAYBACK</span> - If you refer lots of members your in the big time haha ;). Lets say your family. maybe 3 people are in your family? that’s <span class="bbcode-b">£15</span> towards your chosen charity/Paypal/phone credit.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Never heard of this network. Not going to trust it.</span></span><br>
Ok. It’s quite small compared to most. However just to convince you they’re worth it, I’ve been a member for 3 months now and I haven’t had a problem and they’ve been around for a couple of years now.<br>
Also I’m sure a lot of you watch the Big Bang Theory?</p>
<p>Check out who’s sponsoring them now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><img src="http://www.thedrum.co.uk/uploads/drum_basic_article/89403/main_images/giffgaff.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">After You’ve got your Free sim card in the post.</span></span><br>
You have to activate it with £10 credit (sign up with my link and get an extra £5 after activation), give it some time to activate, and then stick it in your phone. Simple-as.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">YOU MUST HAVE AN UNLOCKED PHONE OR AN O2 LOCKED PHONE FOR THE SIM CARD TO WORK</span><br>
Thought I’d stick that in caps and in bold there, just to make sure you could see it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Well I don’t know what else to say, oh yeah, they’re online only - can’t find sim cards in shops and must activate sim card online.<br>
You can buy top up vouchers from newsagents etc like you normally would. Also O2 top up vouchers also work (but dont ring the o2 top up voucher)<br>
If you don’t like top up vouchers just use your credit/debit card online to top up.</p>
<p>Well that’s it I think. Comment If you’ve ordered a sim :), also if you need any help just ask <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
Remember signing up under me gives you an extra £5 credit and me an extra £5 credit too!</p>
