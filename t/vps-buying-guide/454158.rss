    <description>Guide to the world of a Virtual Private Server (Vps).
Welcome to my guide on how to find a Windows or linux VPS.


Part 1: There are a lot of choices to make before deciding on your VPS. Such as what operating system do you want, how much ram/diskspace, bandwidth and Cpu you will need, Also what how much you are wanting to pay.
First off we are going to talk about the operating system. There are major differences in the two operating systems you have to choose from, now keep in mind that each of these major OS&#39;s come with different versions for you to pick through to suite your needs best. My personal choice is the Windows server 2008 as It is fast, has the feel of a regular computer and is usually more secure. The same is to be said with Windows server 2003. These are the only Windows OP&#39;s I would recommend for a VPS for RsPs. Now on to Linux, Linux comes in many variations and is the #1 free OS in the world. As you have so many choices in this area it can be very confusing as to where to start. For a Linux OS I would recommend centOS.
 If you read below and look at my charts. I will compare the Prices, and the specs of my favorite VPS companies.

Alright here&#39;s a few slides to show some basic information, Then we get you off to the interwebz for some shopping ;D

WILL UPDATE WITH MORE INFORMATION SOON.



My personal opinions on the matters.

I personally have had experience with each of these companies and their products. This is my evaluation of their Customer support, Overall speed, and Help with problems.

Myhosting.com:

Myhosting.com is by far my favorite, They were in relatively inexpensive for the type of VPS I bought,
They set it up within an hour and everything worked great. They even give you a 2 week grace period to either remove your data from the vps, or to pay your next bill. Support was fast and very effective.

Liquidweb.com:

Liquidweb.com was one of the first VPS companies I used. I started out on a linux without their 10$ support package and they still helped me as much as they possibly could. I ended up spending the 10$ and from there on out they set anything up that I asked for. Very fast service, And always a American with very great english.

Vpsland.com:
 
I am not a fan of vpsland, their packages are not good for running a rsps, they offer no customization  as far as in the start. The Customer service is like a bunch of monkeys humping a banana (Something you don&#39;t want to deal with.)</description>

Simply nothing better, those vps’s mentioned earlier for 30$/m aren’t ddos protected. Which makes them worthless. For 28$ a month you get virtually the same specs AND protection from attacks.</p>

<p>WILL UPDATE WITH MORE INFORMATION SOON.</p>
<p>My personal opinions on the matters.</p>
<p>I personally have had experience with each of these companies and their products. This is my evaluation of their Customer support, Overall speed, and Help with problems.</p>
<p><a href="http://Myhosting.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Myhosting.com</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://Myhosting.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Myhosting.com</a> is by far my favorite, They were in relatively inexpensive for the type of VPS I bought,<br>
They set it up within an hour and everything worked great. They even give you a 2 week grace period to either remove your data from the vps, or to pay your next bill. Support was fast and very effective.</p>
<p><a href="http://Liquidweb.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Liquidweb.com</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://Liquidweb.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Liquidweb.com</a> was one of the first VPS companies I used. I started out on a linux without their 10$ support package and they still helped me as much as they possibly could. I ended up spending the 10$ and from there on out they set anything up that I asked for. Very fast service, And always a American with very great english.</p>
<p><a href="http://Vpsland.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Vpsland.com</a>:</p>
<p>I am not a fan of vpsland, their packages are not good for running a rsps, they offer no customization  as far as in the start. The Customer service is like a bunch of monkeys humping a banana (Something you don’t want to deal with.)</p>
