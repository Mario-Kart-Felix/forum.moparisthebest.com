[img]http://i664.photobucket.com/albums/vv9/armadylZeus/Image2-5.png[/img]	BioHazard is a maximum game of four players. After the lobby you are put into the building in Sophanem. The point of the game is to last as long as possible, with waves of monsters coming out of the Grave.  Different monsters spawn from the graves, they walk down the line, and you must kill them to earn Points, Simple. 

       • To do:
○ Lobby
○ Objects
○ Npc Spawning
○ Point System for BioHazard
○ keeping the Monsters in the boundaries
○ more waves
○ More to Add

[hr]

[size=14pt]• Quest; Wealthy Build[/size]

Story line;
.. Will be up shortly, sorry

[img]http://i664.photobucket.com/albums/vv9/armadylZeus/Image4-1.png[/img]
[hr]

[size=14pt]• Spheres[/size]
Spheres are obtainable objects in Recoil Rift, for which if you collect several of the right combination (Look down for list of obtainable spheres) you may trade them in for several more then decent weapons. You can count how many Spheres you have by going to your quest tab, although it is hard to tell spheres apart from each other. Still working on an custom interface for Spheres.

The Servers starting to introduce Spheres for the player to hunt them; (Story line of Spheres)

Spheres are a magical and mysterious forces, there power is trapped within the glass balls.
Your job as an adventurer is to seek out these mysterious orbs. If you collect all of the different Monsters or Demons trapped inside the orbs, you will gain a force beyond anything recognizable to the Recoil Rift. If you&#39;re expecting a Enchanted Sword, or a Mystical Spell, think again. Just be ready to expect the unexpected. Just remember these Demons and Monsters where trapped within the orbs from someone who has tricked them, the one who put them there will not be pleased with you letting them out. 

Obtainable Orbs?
• Spacial
• Dark
• Light
• Earth
• Water
• Air
• Fire
• Electricity
• Love
• Hate
• Torment
• Pestilence
• Greed
• Lust
• Honor

[img]http://i664.photobucket.com/albums/vv9/armadylZeus/Image7-1.png[/img]
I know this doesn&#39;t prove anything, but i just thought i would share with you what the spheres will physically looks like. (Different Colours, Shapes)


[hr]

[size=14pt]• Safari![/size]
The Safari, you will be able to kill monsters, it will be somewhat like a training section. You&#39;ll have the options to talk to a Safari Instructor, he will be able to count your points and send you after short simple tasks, like &quot;Spying&quot; a creature, in the Safari Zone. Once Spotted you must go back to the instructor for your point. You may kill the creature for a [i]rare[/i] object or spot it for Safari Points. 

Safari is still basic, not my first priority ..
Pictures not ready yet,

[hr]
[size=14pt]• Contamination Zone[/size]
I&#39;ve made a Contamination Zone Lumbridge, i felt like it would be cool to have a barren land, nestled by deformed cruel mysterious befouling creatures. I&#39;ve also made it mandatory to visit the Contamination Zone although i have not made it take any hitpoints away if you go out with a mask yet. I&#39;ll be working on this a little more, adding NPC&#39;s making it take away hitpoints and making a little quest to go along with it. Also of course a monster of imagining which will drop a pestilence sphere, don&#39;t know what a sphere is? Please read my earlier statement on them.

[img]http://i664.photobucket.com/albums/vv9/armadylZeus/CONTAMINIATIOTNTIONTITNTO.png[/img]
The equipped mask picture of the the screen has a darker screen to perhaps show or give it more of a desolate feeling.

       • To do:
○ Take away HP
○ Adding NPC Content
○ Collectables to form a misc. object
○ More to come!



[hr]

[size=14pt]• Skills[/size]

Currently removing ALL skills as i don&#39;t feel they are worth keeping as they are very glitched, partially not working, and just a pain. I&#39;ll deal with these close to last, as i would like to add more customized content and monsters, away from Skills..

<p>[size=14pt]• Spheres[/size]<br>
Spheres are obtainable objects in Recoil Rift, for which if you collect several of the right combination (Look down for list of obtainable spheres) you may trade them in for several more then decent weapons. You can count how many Spheres you have by going to your quest tab, although it is hard to tell spheres apart from each other. Still working on an custom interface for Spheres.</p>
<p>The Servers starting to introduce Spheres for the player to hunt them; (Story line of Spheres)</p>
<p>Spheres are a magical and mysterious forces, there power is trapped within the glass balls.<br>
Your job as an adventurer is to seek out these mysterious orbs. If you collect all of the different Monsters or Demons trapped inside the orbs, you will gain a force beyond anything recognizable to the Recoil Rift. If you’re expecting a Enchanted Sword, or a Mystical Spell, think again. Just be ready to expect the unexpected. Just remember these Demons and Monsters where trapped within the orbs from someone who has tricked them, the one who put them there will not be pleased with you letting them out.</p>
<p>Obtainable Orbs?<br>
• Spacial<br>
• Dark<br>
• Light<br>
• Earth<br>
• Water<br>
• Air<br>

I know this doesn’t prove anything, but i just thought i would share with you what the spheres will physically looks like. (Different Colours, Shapes)</p>

<p>[size=14pt]• Safari![/size]<br>
The Safari, you will be able to kill monsters, it will be somewhat like a training section. You’ll have the options to talk to a Safari Instructor, he will be able to count your points and send you after short simple tasks, like “Spying” a creature, in the Safari Zone. Once Spotted you must go back to the instructor for your point. You may kill the creature for a <span class="bbcode-i">rare</span> object or spot it for Safari Points.</p>
<p>Safari is still basic, not my first priority …<br>
Pictures not ready yet,</p>

[size=14pt]• Contamination Zone[/size]<br>
I’ve made a Contamination Zone Lumbridge, i felt like it would be cool to have a barren land, nestled by deformed cruel mysterious befouling creatures. I’ve also made it mandatory to visit the Contamination Zone although i have not made it take any hitpoints away if you go out with a mask yet. I’ll be working on this a little more, adding NPC’s making it take away hitpoints and making a little quest to go along with it. Also of course a monster of imagining which will drop a pestilence sphere, don’t know what a sphere is? Please read my earlier statement on them.</p>

The equipped mask picture of the the screen has a darker screen to perhaps show or give it more of a desolate feeling.</p>
<pre><code>   • To do:
</code></pre>
<p>○ Take away HP<br>
○ Adding NPC Content<br>
○ Collectables to form a misc. object<br>
○ More to come!</p>

<p>[size=14pt]• Skills[/size]</p>
<p>Currently removing ALL skills as i don’t feel they are worth keeping as they are very glitched, partially not working, and just a pain. I’ll deal with these close to last, as i would like to add more customized content and monsters, away from Skills…</p>
