A weekly commentary by Face The Nation Single point Bob Schieffer . Want to know precisely what offended me the most about the shenanigans of Brian Carty, the guy who leaped American airlines? Properly, it was all those i’m sorry he put out after he got caught trying to salt away big bonuses and pensions for himself and also the other airline big-wigs soon after he had convinced send out pilots, flight guests and mechanics to take big cuts in their pay and benefits to prevent bankruptcy. He wasn’t sorry for the purpose he’s done, needless to say. He was just remorseful he got caught, that brought forth seven apologies. Well, Public relations experts and turmoil managers make a living by simply telling business and government leaders inside a crunch to do precisely what Carty did; call any news conference, i am sorry profusely, say you’ve got learned from the encounter and then say you need to move on. No fee, of course, just i am sorry, and most of the time it truely does work. But what I ended up being thinking about as I observed Carty’s numerous mea culpas was how you used to try the same thing when we were kids. "I’m sorry, I’m sorry,In . we’d cry whenever we saw my new mother coming at all of us. “A little late for your,” she’d reply, just before she whacked all of us. Well, happily, the actual American Airlines table, under heavy stress from the Flight Attendants’ Partnership, took my single parent’s approach on this a single and fired Carty. Great for them. But viewing these business scams unfold time after time leaves me wondering. These types of CEOs all seem to be highly educated in the tactics of excusing excessive behavior. But why don’t you consider ethics? Has in which become a foreign language will no longer required? It’s really bad my mother’s no longer around. She may have taught a whole new training course at one of those move on business schools.  <a href="http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccihandbags.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">gucci handbags sale</a></p>
