    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/revision-help-ideas/186786</link>
    <description>Here in the UK, we have as little as 10 weeks left until we face are GCSE exams, and about now is the time to start revising. I personally hate revising. All of it just leaves my brain a day after revision, especially with Maths (and seeing as I am aiming for an unlikely B in maths, that is not good). Next Tuesday, I have enrolled myself on a one day course, in Essex, by a professional to help me with revision and how to keep things in my brain for the exam. The guy doing it has spent 3 years at University studying things like this, and i&#39;m hoping it&#39;s going to help.

I think this would be a good time and place, seeing as we are mostly 13-17 year olds, to post revision tips, ideas, exam stories ect. Give motivational help to those who need it and such. 

I&#39;ll report back with my learnings next week.</description>

              <p>Greeny’s brain storming idea.</p>
<p>I used mind maps for my CATS(Year 7 exams) and often when i get home, even tho this sounds very gay, I would make a mind map about the topic then add to it during/after the lesson.</p>
<p>This could be useful to you as i usually forget shit aswell.</p>

              <p>Well I’m not planning on revising that much at all.</p>
<p>From past experiences with other exams i’ve found it more useful to not waste my time revising and instead spend the time relaxing. Whether this truely works or not, i dont know, but I don’t plan to revise that much for GCSE’S.</p>
<p>I didn’t revise for my mocks and i got all the grades i wanted, if not some even higher.</p>

              <p>My exams start on the 19th of may. I will learn some classes, including history but some classes you just have to know. Like maths, you cant really learn it. I have done my best in normal tests so I can get like a 4 in some of them and still pass.</p>

<p>Real Advice (I don’t do this but I just came up with it :p):<br>
Try brain storming everything you can think about on 1 topic. and just add more and more as you remember more over weeks. (best with A3 paper I guess).<br>
With Maths, do lots of practice papers. Seriously do as many as is physically possible. Only the numbers used for questions actually change, they’re all basically similar year by year (except for the final A* question). Doing 1 practice exam per week for Maths for the next 10 weeks would be the best prep possible IMO.</p>
