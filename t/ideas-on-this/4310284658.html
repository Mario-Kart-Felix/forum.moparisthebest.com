<p>Believe or not I have a notebook of ideas on this because this has been my big project for the last six months. Without getting into major systems we could talk about the general objective? It’s very complex and my current work right now is data collection of all the clients. I studied the clients for hooks the last month and compiled a nice long list of ways to analyze packets and protocols which is my next step after I finish my current scripting project.<br>
[/quote]You missed my question. What would the system do? You’d have to analyze the packets and protocol for anything like this, but I mean quite literally, what would the end product be of your ‘system’? Would it black out those areas, or what?</p>

</aside>
<p>Well the whole objective of this project is to create multi revisional server? The customer would download a little package plugin file and start it up, and that’s it. Also we were working towards creating a very easy to use plugin system and a ‘RSBuddy’ approach to RSPS but that is very far off in the future.<br>
[/quote]… You missed it again. What is the <span class="bbcode-b">end</span> product? What will the PLAYER see? You were saying that you can fix the discrepancies between the revisions, so what would that fix entail?</p>

</aside>
<p>You are oblivious. It’s a server, what do you think they will see? It’s ONE SERVER that runs ONE REVISION but that server can easily CHANGE REVISIONS in a click of the mouse.</p>

<p>I’m in it for the money. Imagine people downloading a castle wars plugin off a plugin repository and it installing into their server without having to worry about moving it to a higher revision. You’d make a ton of money from that repository if you took some of the money from the people selling their plugin.</p>
<p>Hey butt fuck, this is exactly what I was asking advice for about two months ago. Remember?</p>

<p>Well the whole objective of this project is to create multi revisional server? The customer would download a little package plugin file and start it up, and that’s it.

<p>Just have a little revision number tagged onto the content? &gt;690 etc? Obviously plugins geared to support more revisions will make more so content developers will work towards support so that their product is used on many revisions instead of one.</p>
<p>How is that hard to think about?</p>
<p>Don’t be stupid David. The networking for all the clients is the same, the file system changes once in a blue moon, the packet system is still the same and they have a wrapper class for the packet id and size as of earlish RuneTek 4. It’s a company and changing things dramatically takes money and time. Be smart about this.</p>

<p>That’s what the data collection is for. Before the server started up and you knew what revision it was going to run you’d run through the plugins and pull from a server all the required data for the server to function properly. Ex: Npc definitions, landscape data, object definitions.</p>
