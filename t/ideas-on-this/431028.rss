    <title>Ideas, on this</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ideas-on-this/431028</link>
    <description>   Well, my partner and I are creating a server/client, which will handle multiple revisions, and all run off of one server.
We are going to be using Databases, and it will all work coherently. They will share the char files, every data on them (Items on higher revisions won&#39;t load on the lower revisions obviously, but you should get my point). Anyways this is not the question that I have.
   We are trying to decide how to handle the structure. How packet handling, etc will be done. It should be (in his words) &quot;we need a system which is completely based on stuff without any connection to a client..&quot;. In other words no client needed. The system will be using a library to handle most everything, however packet handling and such we are trying to come up with ways to do it. Any advice would be nice, and no dumbass responses.</description>

<p>That’s what the data collection is for. Before the server started up and you knew what revision it was going to run you’d run through the plugins and pull from a server all the required data for the server to function properly. Ex: Npc definitions, landscape data, object definitions.</p>

<p>Believe or not I have a notebook of ideas on this because this has been my big project for the last six months. Without getting into major systems we could talk about the general objective? It’s very complex and my current work right now is data collection of all the clients. I studied the clients for hooks the last month and compiled a nice long list of ways to analyze packets and protocols which is my next step after I finish my current scripting project.<br>

</aside>
<p>Well the whole objective of this project is to create multi revisional server? The customer would download a little package plugin file and start it up, and that’s it. Also we were working towards creating a very easy to use plugin system and a ‘RSBuddy’ approach to RSPS but that is very far off in the future.<br>
[/quote]… You missed it again. What is the <span class="bbcode-b">end</span> product? What will the PLAYER see? You were saying that you can fix the discrepancies between the revisions, so what would that fix entail?</p>

</aside>
<p>You are oblivious. It’s a server, what do you think they will see? It’s ONE SERVER that runs ONE REVISION but that server can easily CHANGE REVISIONS in a click of the mouse.</p>
<p>I don’t care what the player sees I care about what my customer sees.<br>
[/quote]We were talking about the server discrepancies, when a person is playing the game, and how we would handle them. You said your system would handle this… didn’t you?</p>

<p>The topic changed, read and keep up.<br>
[/quote]So you were only replying to the crashing part? Because I was talking about the part before that, like the map differences.

I’m not sure what you would even need ‘hooks’ or ‘massive lists’ for, the protocols are all already out there.</p>

<p>Why the hell would I go out and write a package for every server when I could have a program do it for me?<br>

</aside>
<p>I’m in it for the money. Imagine people downloading a castle wars plugin off a plugin repository and it installing into their server without having to worry about moving it to a higher revision.<br>
[/quote]What about a soul wars plugin? That’s my point, and what zyle was talking about, how would you handle stuff in lower revisions that aren’t in the higher revisions, or vice versa?[/quote]</p>
<p>Just have a little revision number tagged onto the content? &gt;690 etc? Obviously plugins geared to support more revisions will make more so content developers will work towards support so that their product is used on many revisions instead of one.</p>
<p>How is that hard to think about?</p>
<p>Don’t be stupid David. The networking for all the clients is the same, the file system changes once in a blue moon, the packet system is still the same and they have a wrapper class for the packet id and size as of earlish RuneTek 4. It’s a company and changing things dramatically takes money and time. Be smart about this.</p>
