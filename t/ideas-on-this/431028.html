We are trying to decide how to handle the structure. How packet handling, etc will be done. It should be (in his words) “we need a system which is completely based on stuff without any connection to a client…”. In other words no client needed. The system will be using a library to handle most everything, however packet handling and such we are trying to come up with ways to do it. Any advice would be nice, and no dumbass responses.</p>

        <p>I’d be more interested in how you’re going to handle the item and cache discrepancies, which would ruin the point for people on lower revisions.<br>
As for handling the structure, isn’t that painfully obvious? You’ll just need to have an interface that each packethandler/structure extends, and assign a user one of the subclasses based on the logon protocol information when they sign in (like Pure Slay said). Obviously there are a few ways to handle it, you could have XML or something like RSC does for each revision to document each packet, personally I think just having an interface to extend would be easier</p>
<p>[quote=“Pure Slay, post:2, topic:431028”]As for the multi revisional client. Lol don’t waste your time, near impossible. Unless you want to add exceptions for every new thing added in the client for each revision change.[/quote]You could just load a different client/cache based on a user selection, but you’d sacrifice size to do it.</p>

        <p>The main problem, as David stated, would be the discrepancies between revisions. There’s no Grand Exchange on 317 clients. So there would be a lot of people, around an empty part outside of Varrock, with Npcs that can only be sent to players with 508 clients. It would look like everyone was schizophrenic. Trying to send those items/objects/npcs/interfaces to players on the 317 client would crash every time.</p>

<p>I didn’t say you couldn’t. I just said that if one did make a system to handle multiple revisions, it would be very… buggy, in terms of content, due to the differences in revision.</p>

<p>Believe or not I have a notebook of ideas on this because this has been my big project for the last six months. Without getting into major systems we could talk about the general objective? It’s very complex and my current work right now is data collection of all the clients. I studied the clients for hooks the last month and compiled a nice long list of ways to analyze packets and protocols which is my next step after I finish my current scripting project. The general idea is to stand back and try and scope out how you would integrate the systems in all the clients. It’s not too difficult if you understand a ton of client history.</p>
<p>But yes the server should only run one revision.</p>

<p>Well the whole objective of this project is to create multi revisional server? The customer would download a little package plugin file and start it up, and that’s it. Also we were working towards creating a very easy to use plugin system and a ‘RSBuddy’ approach to RSPS but that is very far off in the future.</p>

<p>The main problem, as David stated, would be the discrepancies between revisions. There’s no Grand Exchange on 317 clients. So there would be a lot of people, around an empty part outside of Varrock, with Npcs that can only be sent to players with 508 clients. It would look like everyone was schizophrenic. Trying to send those items/objects/npcs/interfaces to players on the 317 client would crash every time.</p>

<p>Believe or not I have a notebook of ideas on this because this has been my big project for the last six months. Without getting into major systems we could talk about the general objective? It’s very complex and my current work right now is data collection of all the clients. I studied the clients for hooks the last month and compiled a nice long list of ways to analyze packets and protocols which is my next step after I finish my current scripting project.<br>

<p>Well the whole objective of this project is to create multi revisional server? The customer would download a little package plugin file and start it up, and that’s it. Also we were working towards creating a very easy to use plugin system and a ‘RSBuddy’ approach to RSPS but that is very far off in the future.[/quote]… You missed it again. What is the <span class="bbcode-b">end</span> product? What will the PLAYER see? You were saying that you can fix the discrepancies between the revisions, so what would that fix entail?</p>
