    <title>Help! Pc upgrade</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-pc-upgrade/56782</link>
    <description>My 2 year old computer is in need of an upgrade.

Here are the specs:

P4 2.6ghz
512 (256 x 2) MB RAM
Winfast A180B Nvidia geforce4 mx4000 video card
Integrated Audio (=P)
Windows XP Home Service Pack 2

I was thinking along the lines of more memory, since that seems to be what&#39;s bogging me down mainly.  The video card can wait until next Christmas...I think.

Here are the specs of my MoBo (not exact model, but close, it is a VIARAMA U8568 (Pro)/U8668 (Pro)/U8868):

Specs (these mean nothing to me, how about you):

[code]168-pin DIMM Banking  	2 (2 banks of 1)
184-pin DIMM Banking 	           2 (2 banks of 1)
Chipset 	                         VIA ProSavageDDR P4M266
DDR SDRAM Frequencies 	         PC1600 and PC2100
Error Detection Support 	    Non-ECC only
Graphics Support 	              AGP 4X
Max Unbuffered DDR SDRAM 	2048MB
Max Unbuffered SDR SDRAM 	2048MB
Module Types Supported 	Unbuffered only
SDR SDRAM Frequencies 	PC100 and PC133
Supported DRAM Types 	SDR SDRAM and DDR SDRAM
USB Support 	              2.x Compliant[/code]

OR:

Do you have any suggestions for upgrades (RAM, etc?)

EDIT: If I didn&#39;t mention before, I&#39;m on a really, really strict budget, so no $400 upgrades, k?

Thanks in advance,

              <p>I have a ton worse than that, and I’m fine. Is there any reason to upgrade? Why not wait another year until ram and stuff are cheaper? Maybe then there will be some Vista-only programs (maybe not) so you’ll be forced to upgrade both your OS <span class="bbcode-i">and</span> system.</p>
