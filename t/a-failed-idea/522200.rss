    <title>A failed idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-failed-idea/522200</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure where to begin with this. First of all I&#39;m expecting a lot of corrections or maybe even some abuse at my ability to code but either way I&#39;m going to throw it out there. I&#39;ve been trying to get into Java for about 3 weeks now; I woke up about 20 minutes ago and had this incredible idea to create a text responsive Rock paper Scissors. Although half way through coding it I realize i&#39;ve gotten a bit ahead of myself and im at the point of where im confusing myself with my own code. [code]package Rockpaperscissors;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;
class Rockpaperscissors{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner user = new Scanner(System.in);
        Scanner play = new Scanner(System.in);
        Scanner choice = new Scanner(System.in);
        String r = &quot;Rock&quot;;
        String p = &quot;Paper&quot;;
        String s = &quot;Scissors&quot;;
        int rock = 1;
        int paper = 2;
        int scissors = 3;
        String yes = &quot;y&quot;;
        String no = &quot;n&quot;;
        String name;
        String rockCh = &quot;R&quot;;
        String paperCh = &quot;P&quot;;
        String scissorCh = &quot;S&quot;;
        int playerchoice;
        
        System.out.println(&quot;Hey! What&#39;s your name?&quot;);
        name = user.nextLine();
        System.out.println(&quot;Hey there &quot;+name+ &quot; want to play rock paper scissors? (y = yes, n = no)&quot;);
        
        if(play.nextLine().equals(yes)){
            System.out.println(&quot;Use R for rock P for paper or S for Scissors&quot;);
            play.nextLine();
        }else if(play.nextLine().equals(no)){
            if(choice.next().equals(rockCh)){
                playerchoice = 1;
                System.out.println(&quot;You&#39;ve chosen Rock!&quot;);
            }else if(choice.next().equals(paperCh)){
                playerchoice = 2;
                System.out.println(&quot;You&#39;ve chosen Paper!&quot;);
            }else if(choice.next().equals(scissorCh)){
                playerchoice = 3;
                System.out.println(&quot;you&#39;ve chosen Scissors!&quot;);
            }
            
            Random rps = new Random(3);
            if (rps.nextInt() == rock ){
                System.out.println(&quot;The computer chose rock!&quot;);
            }else if(rps.nextInt() == paper){
                System.out.println(&quot;The computer chose paper!&quot;);
                
            }
            
        }
        
        
        
    }
}[/code] 

I know its very messy but i wanted to keep it in one class. I&#39;m also aware i could of used char instead of Strings but I&#39;m not that confident with chars, it kept coming up with some problem when i set the scanner equal to it. Alright so this overall is quite a pointless thread but even though it doesn&#39;t bloody work I&#39;m quite proud of my progress in this from 3 weeks of self tutoring myself aswell as motivating myself to learn this language. So here&#39;s the very ugly attempt of my Rock Paper Scissors game. If you wish to elaborate on it feel free haha it took me about 10 minutes till I realized I&#39;d fucked up somewhere and I couldn&#39;t even make sense of half the stuff I had written. But it&#39;s there. Sooo ye, If you feel the need to post any criticism please don&#39;t because It&#39;s a good way to ruin a beginners expectations aswell as ambitions. Although i welcome any educational feedback :D</description>

              <p>ah thank you very much and yeah i didn’t get round to declaring the choice. The random although was for the computer. The player would choose either rock paper or scissors and the computer would respond at random. But yea thanks, Lin <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
I’ve checked out your game engine and model animation on the developer forums and it’s really impressive.</p>

              <p>Everyone starts out making these sorts of things. My first program was made with my cousin in C++ where you entered your age and it told you how old you’d be in a certain year. The problem I see with your code is I don’t see “choice” declared. I’m assuming it’s supposed to be a Random, but it’s not declared so I can’t tell. Also, since you’re just calling “next”, it could return any unsigned integer, so you might want to see if there’s a next(max) method. If not, use the modulus operator (%) and add 1, so like chance.next() % 3 + 1, since your rps values start at 1.</p>
