    <title>Easy Solution To Multi-PickUp</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/easy-solution-to-multi-pickup/164337</link>
    <description>When you pickup an item from the ground, as you all know, if there are 20 sharks on the spot and you pick up 1, it deletes them all.

So i was thinking.

If you gave each dropped item an ID, in the method which removes the item from the ground, you could make it remove the item drop ID not the actually item ID which deletes them all..

If someone that thinks they can wants to join me to do this, as i already tryed it once but failed miserably, feel free to post your MSN or something.</description>

<p>That part wasn’t necessary, but it will work whether you leave it in there or not.</p>

              <p>I forgot about that but cheers i’ll look into it more.</p>
<p>About this topic, its the “itemID” which is the problem.</p>
<p>It deletes the item from the ground with the “itemID”.</p>
<p>If it deleted the item using the “itemDropID” it would only delete the item with the “itemDropID” of “x”, even if there was 2 sharks, one would have the itemDropID of “1” and the other would be “2” so if you click pickup on one of them, say “x” it wouldn’t delete “x” and “y” unlike the “itemID”, just “x” from the “itemDropID”.</p>
<p>Confusing but hope you understand.</p>

              <p>Or, you could just change how the packets are sent/received between the client and the server. I haven’t looked into it, but the way you are thinking of a solution is much too complicated then it has to be.</p>
<p>If you think about it my way, you can see that when a somebody uses the client and clicks on an item on the ground, it sends a packet to the server to pick it up. Unforunately, winterLove, meant for her server to be somewhat of an emulator. Not the real thing. So not all of the packets have been mastered or discovered fully.</p>
<p>Find the packet that indicates <span class="bbcode-i">pickup item</span>, which after searching I found it was packet 236, and you can see it’s all right there. After searching through an old server of mine, I found:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">			case 236: //pickup item
				int itemY = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
				int itemID = inStream.readUnsignedWord();
				int itemX = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
					if(ItemHandler.itemExists(itemID, itemX, itemY)) 
					if(absX == itemX &amp;&amp; absY == itemY) 
                                             {
						if(itemID == 1042 || itemID == 1044 || itemID == 1046 || itemID == 1048 &amp;&amp; actionTimer == 0)
						{
							actionTimer += 10;
							server.itemHandler.removeItem(itemID, absX, absY, 1);
							server.itemHandler.addItem(itemID, absX + misc.random(1), absY + misc.random(1), 1, playerId, true);
						} else if(itemID != 1042)
                                                {
						int itemAmount = ItemHandler.itemAmount(itemID, itemX, itemY);
						pickUpItem(itemID, itemAmount);
						ItemHandler.removeItem(itemID, itemX, itemY, itemAmount);
						removeGroundItem(itemX, itemY, itemID);
                                                				resetItems(3214);
                                                }
                                }
				break;</code></pre>
<p>May not look like much, but it is. Just focus on the <span class="bbcode-b">ItemHandler.removeItem(itemID, itemX, itemY, itemAmount);</span> method and you should be good. It’s most likely the itemAmount that is the problem, and if not, then something in that method that involves the amount of that item being deleted off the ground is messed up. And if all else fails, then the problem will involve the <span class="bbcode-b">removeGroundItem(itemX, itemY, itemID);</span> method.</p>
<p>There’s a few things to consider and look at. Hope I helped.</p>
