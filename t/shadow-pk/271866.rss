Well...What can i say? Shadow Pk has just been started about a week ago, Haven&#39;t got anything done besides clearing some places of objects, brain storming for ideas, and adding a few cool things. Anyway, This is my first server ever so be kind lol. Anyway, Shadow Pk is not going to be some server you type ::pure and then go theive for like 5 minutes and then pk. Each player on Shadow pking will have to spend time leveling and making cash.(It&#39;s still a lot faster then real RS). Also, A LOT!!! of servers are having problem with dupers, I know a lot of players also hate dupers. I have coded myself , my own ANTI duping. THIS IS NOT A LEECH OF SOMONE ELSE(ALL 100% BY ME).Anyway lets get started!

HOME(I know there is a lot of servers with home as edgeville but I don&#39;t care, This is not one of them servers you see everywhere!

Quite a bit of work is down here, I coded my own bank stash, as you can see, and made a food shop. So if you get low on hp, bank, buy, eat, kick some butt!
