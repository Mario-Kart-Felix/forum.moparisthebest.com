    <title>How do I slow down the projectiles? *Pics!*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-slow-down-the-projectiles-pics/156754</link>
    <description>Hey! I&#39;ve added projectiles to my server and it works!! Woo! But there is one problem... When I shoot the bow, about 3 arrows continuously comes out... (I know its because of the time delay, but I don&#39;t know the int to make it slow down! It&#39;s not PKingDelay =, nor wepdelay =...) Here&#39;s a screenie: (Btw, it also lags my server because of this...)

So yeh, as you can see, it has something to do about the delays... now let me tell you what I added to my client.java,

First, I added this method:

[code]    public void createProjectile(int casterY, int casterX, int offsetY, int offsetX, int angle, int speed, int gfxMoving,
                int startHeight, int endHeight, int MageAttackIndex) {
                outStream.createFrame(85);
                outStream.writeByteC((casterY - (mapRegionY * 8)) - 2);
                outStream.writeByteC((casterX - (mapRegionX * 8)) - 3);
                outStream.createFrame(117);
                outStream.writeByte(angle);                     //Starting place of the projectile
                outStream.writeByte(offsetY);               //Distance between caster and enemy Y
                outStream.writeByte(offsetX);                //Distance between caster and enemy X
                outStream.writeWord(MageAttackIndex);        //The NPC the missle is locked on to
                outStream.writeWord(gfxMoving);             //The moving graphic ID
                outStream.writeByte(startHeight);           //The starting height
                outStream.writeByte(endHeight);             //Destination height
                outStream.writeWord(51);                        //Time the missle is created
                outStream.writeWord(speed);                     //Speed minus the distance making it set
                outStream.writeByte(16);                        //Initial slope
                outStream.writeByte(64);                        //Initial distance from source (in the direction of the missile) //64    
    }[/code]

Which has no problems, but I&#39;m just showing you, then, I added these 2 ints: (Don&#39;t matter where, just out of other codes...)

[code]public int offsetX = 0;
public int offsetY = 0;[/code]

Then under the 2 crystal bow equipments I added this: (This is what the whole code looks like)

[code]boolean UseBow = false;
if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4214)	//Crystal bow
{
 createProjectile(absY, absX, offsetX, offsetY, 50, 107, 249, 43, 42, 0 - AttackingOn);
 PkingDelay = 8;
 wepdelay = 8;
 UseBow = true; 
}[/code]

Now you know what I added... any1 have any ideas on how to slow it down?</description>
