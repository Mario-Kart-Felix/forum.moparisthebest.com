You have caused all other private servers to die, therefore, you are the sole reason as to why rsc is dying.<br>

Also, you write on somewhere that its totally safe to download the client etc etc etc, because some kids are afraid to try out private servers.</p>

<p>Why hasn’t RSCAngel, RSCDaemon, RSCDevil (or any other semi-replica RSC private server) ruined it?</p>
<p>And no, I can’t figure out what I’m missing… Everyone has a different opinion, just because you’re so convinced you know what’s right (which you haven’t actually said) doesn’t mean every other player agrees with you.[/quote]I’m sorry if i offended you but common man you don’t need anyone to tell you what was the most you did enjoy on RSC, it is your own experience not mine not others.</p>
<p>But i can tell you my own <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I did play rsc on an old laptop with 64m of ram, win98 and dial-up connection (you know what that means on wilderness :p) but i it wont stop me to go to castle because i never know what could happen up there. It was so random that i could not get bored of it, i never know who will i fight or what was the stats of the other guy, or what items could have. It was not predictable and it something that rsce lost long ago.</p>

<p>mystic why don’t you ever make a video?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well for one, I’ve never made a video in my life (put multiple clips together) and I don’t even know how lol. Though I’m sure I could easily figure it out, there is one other reason. I have recorded myself pking before on RSCE because for a while people were calling me an acer every time they fought me. The problem is, when I recorded using hypercam (free) it would cause me to lag just a little bit, but enough to have an effect on my pking. I have a bunch of clips, though, some are even pretty leet, if I do say so myself (me getting 3v1d  fucking around in ruby ammy+ rune chain+ gloves and 3hitting ppl) but when I go to upload those clips to youtube it takes fucking AGES and drastically increases my latency as it’s using all my bandwidth (10 mb/s down, 2ish up). So yah…</p>
<p>tl;dr: I cbf making one.</p>

I agree and disagree…</p>
<p>Their stats did them a lot of favours yeah, I was ‘only’ 85hp and would get destroyed by 99hp’s most of the time, but I’ve never seen anyone catch like we used to on RSC, there’s just no need… I’ve PK’d a LOT on private servers and haven’t seen anyone put 20-40 catches together like you’d see on RSC, I remember literally catching people every direction from level 40 wilderness until they ran out of levels at 8 wilderness or whatever lol, that never happened on private servers in my experience</p>
<p>Probably a lot to do with the latency though… No private server has ever been as fast as PK’ing on a London server on RSC, even though internet speeds are 10x faster now.[/quote]</p>
<p>yeh becoz the latency is no where as fast as the jagex servers and the private servers these days r constantly being ddos’d</p>

</aside>
<p>Ive been 1sqd by you many times when i used to play rsce. I want to know, do you find catching fun when there is no delay?</p>
<p>If i think about it, i would prefer 300ms for the fact that it makes catching for me unpredictable. Sometimes i have to click in the direction i think they will run, because if i waiting to see i would be too far behind to make that catch, and when i get lucky and it works…i have the biggest smile.</p>

I was 100% legit until RSC was coming to an end and everyone was moving to RS2. I could see the future (forcing us to quit or play RS2) so just pissed around with google mainly because I was amazed at the programming behind it and idolized Kaitnieks. Kryptix got banned in late 2005 but the reality is, as soon as I started using google for a few PK trips everyone just presumed I must have AC’d the whole time, even when I was legit etc…[/quote]You being legit?<br>

<p>By far the best PKers on RSC were Sue Me and Adx1. As a team they were unstoppable pretty much. It used to be me, Adx1, Sue Me, Zorro Toy and Lord Vid. We’d make a good group. :)[/quote]</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>When adx started MI I pked with all of those people as well (though I was only 82 70 99 with 1 mage on rsc) and my god I must have pked 60 sets when I was in MI.</p>
<p>Also, I (and most good pkers on rsce) would smash the “great” pkers of that time. All they had were the stats and gp to afford casts at a time when a lot of pkers didn’t cast at all.</p>
