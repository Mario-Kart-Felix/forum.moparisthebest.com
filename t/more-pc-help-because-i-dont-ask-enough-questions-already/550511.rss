    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/more-pc-help-because-i-dont-ask-enough-questions-already/550511</link>
    <description>So I bought a used pc &quot;Probably not my best idea&quot; I bought one because my laptop just fried after replacing the hard disk and all that well now this pc is not having any issues but really bad slowness and idk why 

[img]http://i1107.photobucket.com/albums/h381/raylaw1/Screenshot_1_zps7vzvr8vb.png[/img]


The pc has 2gb of ram in it right now. Both good sticks. My problem is it says I only have a 1gb stick in it. Note: &quot;Im Running Windows Vista Home Premium 32 bit&quot; The fan has a really bad and really loud buzzing one of the fins got broke on it. So i put a piece of metal under it to quiet it down a little bit Could that be my problem? Cause i honestly have no idea and i should probably stop buying pc&#39;s from the same person  :palm: But could any of you help me? 

Pc specs:

Intel pentium 4 3.2ghz (HT) Technology
2 gbs of ram &quot;only shows 1&quot; 
150gb solid state drive and a 750gb western digital IDE Hard Disk
1gb Nvidia Geforce 8400 GS 


Oh and i seem to have another problem with a person on the forums was wondering if there was any way to block this

<p>Thanks, and yeah i switched them around and they both work. and </p><blockquote>Did you have to buy this POS computer?</blockquote> Probably shouldn’t have but i was desperate but both ram sticks are fully plugged in. so idk what the problem is I’ve been looking all night
<p>:EDIT: After diggin so long I’m pretty sure its the mother board and since im broke. Im just going to buy a 2gb stick and put it in the working slot. And also the CPU has been runnig at 210 Degrees so and I’m pretty sure that isn’t good. Video card is fine everything else is fine the pc is really fast when you first start it but after using it for about 3 1/2 hours gets a little slow and frustrating but i found a Temporary fix for now until i can buy a new pc that has never been used and next time i see that guy im going to kill him</p>
