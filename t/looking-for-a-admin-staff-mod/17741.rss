    <description>[b]Hey guys,

   If you are looking for a Admin, or a Staff-Mod for your Private Server than you have come to the right place! My name is Andrew, and im 16 years old. I have had past experiance being a Admin/Staff-Mod. I was a Staff-Mod on Icescape until i got promoted. Than the server closed down for some reason. Than I joined a server called Hellzscape and i was a Staff-Mod on it for a few weeks. Its not the Hellzscape that is posted on the advirtisements here, it was another one that used to be on the old moparscape forum. Than i had left to another game and came back to Runescape Private Servers. You can contact me by email; ijlaal92@yahoo.com or just PM me.


Thanks,
