    <title>[PI] Need Help With My Project Insanity Source [PI] Will REP++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-help-with-my-project-insanity-source-pi-will-rep/409618</link>
    <description>I am very very very new to Project Insanity servers. I am used to Delta which is much simpler. I need to know how to setup a server.. As in setting IP&#39;s in client and source. I have tried but cannot find where to change the IP address in the files of the client and source. If someone could show me where to change the IP&#39;s I&#39;ll rep++ and thank. 

Teamviewer would be really nice  

THANKS EVERYONE!</description>

              <p>For ip go to client search for client.java<br>
Press ctrl+f and type “server =”<br>
And change ip like to example:<br>
server = “<a href="http://example.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">example.no-ip.org</a>”<br>
Change it to 127.0.0.1<br>
Compile and run server.<br>
