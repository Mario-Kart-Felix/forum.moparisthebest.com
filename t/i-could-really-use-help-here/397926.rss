    <description>so guys i have discovered a few bugs in my server:
1.there are npcs (kalphite to be exact) that i put in my autospawn.cfg but won&#39;t show they are all near the kalphite queen but only the queen is showing!! anyone know what i do??

2. in the tz tok shop thing when i click an item to check it&#39;s value it says
*item name* currently costs 5 coins
*item name* currently costs 5 tokkul
and when i buy it and i don&#39;t have coins or tokkul in my inventory it says you don&#39;t have enough coins
and when i try to buy when i don&#39;t have tokkul but have coins in my inventory it says you don&#39;t have enough tokkul

3.in pest control when you are killing a portal and another player comes(in another turn) it resets the portals hp!

any help with these would be great :o
PS: i tried to fix the shops bug i deleted the shops id from the *if* that requires coins but it is still giving me the messages
