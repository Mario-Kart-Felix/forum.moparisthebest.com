    <description>i have a server i have put on rs-ps.org but i am fed up with them turning off their client loaders so all you see is a client loading for about... ever... anyways i need a alternative client to HybridPvp V3 if someone can tell me what i should use that would be awesome client needs like torva update items and curses interface all need to corrispond to hybrid pvp because i dont want to change all of that lol it would take months and plus i could no longer use my rs-ps&#39;s client or rspscoding&#39;s clients

recoloring: 
i always was kinda currious about this and no one has answered it yet so... how can you find the color ids exactly not memory and not using color ids from other ints somthing like a color picker? and could you point me to the site its on or the download is on? i will probly find use for it later</description>
