    <title>[Request] Best Jew Board Game Of All Time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-best-jew-board-game-of-all-time/368820</link>
    <description>This is a repost from GD.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A sort of amalgam of Monopoly and Halma, where the objective was to collect as many Jews as you could, and get them off the board. The pieces were little pawns wearing pointed medieval Jewish hats; the players moved them by rolling dice; the child winning was the one whose Jews scurried out, &#39;off to Palestine!&#39; through the gates of a walled city.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The game from Germany, “Juden Raus!” (Jews Out!) depicts the policy of racial hatred that defines the Nazi era. It was designed as a family board game that simulates the start of the persecution against the Jewish people of that era.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;distributed by the firm of Rudolf Fabricius at Bad Neusalza-Spremberg. Two copies of the game are known to exist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
