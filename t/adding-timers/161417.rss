    <title>Adding Timers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-timers/161417</link>
    <description>     How would I add a timer to a server without one.. Could I make it globsl (all items) or is there a easy way to make it timed on it&#39;s own? I can&#39;t figure this out, niether can any tutorial I&#39;v seen lol. I looked on google even.. Lots of timers there :o Not concerning this though. If you got a way to add a timer just get me on msn John_95_07@hotmail.com, or post it in [Code][/.code] Form.

-Thanks,
