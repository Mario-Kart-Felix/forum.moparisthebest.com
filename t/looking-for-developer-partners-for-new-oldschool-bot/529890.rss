              <p>you were already told you can’t post the link.</p>
<p>also, you need to provide some sort of way to explain to the reading users that you (and whoever else is at your community) has any given knowledge on the runescape client, and/or botting methods (hex color interpretation, reflection, actually using the robot, etc)</p>
<p>also, you should post some anti-b&amp; methods, information, or techniques.</p>
<p>currently it seems like you have no idea what you’re doing, and hoping to find people who do.<br>
and I, for one, would never trust any botting community that starts up the way you have.</p>
<p>don’t turn this into vault 2006 remake and not do any work and just promise it.<br>
don’t turn this into any post by driman rune and never attempt any work<br>
don’t turn this into powerbot or some shit to try and steal users accounts</p>
