        <p>Well, as some of you may know, I left for a while. Shortly after my departure, I went away for a while. Now that I’m back, I’m designing and developing again. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that this is straying too far away to call it a R.S.P.S. even though it still has many core elements and aspects that are the same as a R.S.P.S.</p>
<p>I wasn’t going to release these, but I don’t see a valid reason for me not to. So here’s some things for you guys to peruse. I was also unable to post the entirety of this, due to the character limit of 20,000.</p>
<p>[b]It’s sort of like RuneScape meets Arcanum: of Steamworks and Magic Obscura meets D&amp;D.</p>
<p>Here’s some background information so you won’t be confused or wondering when you read certain parts of this:</p>
<blockquote>attack = Assault
strength = Power
defence = Guard
ranged = Archery
prayer = Faith
magic = Thaumaturgy
runecrafting = Ritualism
hitpoints = Health
agility = Grace
herblore = Herblaw
thieving = Pilfering
crafting = Creation
fletching = Bow-Crafting
slayer = Executionist
mining = Prospecting
smithing = Forging
fishing = Trawling
cooking = Culinary
firemaking/Woodcutting = Survival
farming = Agriculture</blockquote>
<blockquote>[u]Negative Attributes:[/u]
- Poison: Inflicts 1-9 Hitpoint damage every 20 seconds. (Green Hitsplat)
<ul>

</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Soul-Corruption: Drains 1-3 Prayer Points and 1 Hitpoint every 2-10 seconds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>Offensive Statistics:
<p>Assault = Attack Bonuses/Chance to hit<br>
Powerful = Strength Bonuses/Max hit<br>
Thaumaturgy = Magic accuracy/Max hit<br>
Archery = Ranged accuracy/max hit</p>
<p>Defensive Statistics:</p>
<p>Assault = Defence against how often you are hit by melee<br>
Archery = Defence against how often you are hit by ranged/Max hit<br>
Guard = Defence aganst enemy max hits and also game-breaker boss attacks<br>
Thaumaturgy = Defence against enemy magic and how often they splash</p>
<p>Balanced Statistics:</p>
<p>Faith = The rate at which your Faith drains<br>
Health = The rate and variation of which negative attributes effect you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, here’s what I’ve been designing in the short time that I’ve been back.</p>
<blockquote>Character Background: Upon creation of a new Character, the Player-Character can choose their Background from a pre-generated list of options. There are quite a lot of choices, many of them are very useful, some of them are more for utility, a few of them are permanent, and a couple may only increase your material wealth. Whatever your choice may be, this is what your Character spent their time doing, or how they lived their life... before the Great War, Collapse, and Awakening of Cynosure.
<p>Backgrounds:</p>
<p>Raised by Monks - You were raised by Monks in a monestary from birth, and spent your childhood learning your purpose. You recieve a permanent bonus to your Faith statistic of 10.</p>
<p>Bookworm - You spent all of the free time you had reading any book which you could get your hands on. You are very well educated, and begin the game with 10 levels in all Skills.</p>
<p>Military Enlistment - When the Great War of Cynosure came about, you signed up to fight for your homeland. You were injured before being assigned to the field (-5 Guard Statistic [DEFENSIVE]), but your training remained intact. All Combat stats are raised to 25.</p>
<p>Son of a Hero - Your Father passed away when you were younger, but before leaving this world, he left you with his tactic of enslaving beasts. You are completely immune to any and all Game-Breaker Special Attacks inflicted by Raid Bosses.</p>
<p>Spoiled Child - Being sheltered as a child and spoiled at every opportunity, you are not as battle-hardened as others (-5 to Thaumaturgy and Archery [DEFENSIVE]), however, your parents left you the family fortune in their will. You begin the game with 50,000 pieces of Gold.</p>
<p>Merlin’s Relative - Not only are you related to Merlin, the great wizard, by blood, but you are also his favorite Nephew/Niece (WILL BE DIALOGUE-DEPENDANT BASED UPON GENDER CHOSEN). You have a permanent + 5 bonus to Thaumaturgy.</p>
<p>Sickly Childhood - You become sick easily and had a weak immune system as a child. You are stricken with a permanent weakness to negative attributes (poison, burn, drench, fatigue, soul-corruption. These effects will always have their maximum effect), however you studied combat and watched local tournaments whilst you were sick. You have a permanent bonus of +5 to all Offensive Statistics.</p>
<p>Raised by Vampires - As a child, you strayed off into the wilderness, eventually finding shelter in a remote cave. You awoke the next morning to find yourself captured by Vampires. Seeing that you were young and could be trained for their uses, they spared your life in exchange for your life-long dedication to them. Once the Great War occured, however, they were enslaved into Dungeons with the rest of the beasts. You still remain a friend to the Vampiric Race, and any/all Vampires encountered in-game will never be aggressive towards you. Some Vampires will even have unique dialogue for you.</p>
<p>Family of Creators - You grew up in a family where everyone was very skilled in the Creation Skill. You gain 40 levels in the Creation Skill, but due to their odd ways and controversial of creating, you may never join the Creationist Guild. You gain one unique Creation Recipe which no others know.</p>
<p>Warrior Guild Upbringing - As an oprhan, you were adopted by The Warrior Guild. You begin the game with +1 to all Offensive and Defensive Statistics. However, your hardended nature brings about a -5 Disposition to all N.P.C. you encounter.</p>
<p>Heroic Bloodline - Your parents were both heroes of reknown. You begin the game with 2 Quests of your choosing automatically completed. This does not include Master-Quests or Quest-Lines. Many N.P.C. also have unique and varied dialogue in regards as to this Background.</p>
<p>Knight of the Round Table - After you came of age, you become an honorary member of the Round Table. You focused all of your energy on combat, but your use of magic suffered. You have a decreased resistance to magic as a result (-5% resistance permanent). You begin the game with level 40 in all combat stats except for magic.</p>
<p>Abusive Childhood - You grew up in a shack on the outskirts of Ragnarork, which is the poorest and most crime-ridden city in Cynosure. To make matters worse, both of your parents beat you daily. Once you came of age, you ran away without notice and never looked back. As a result of the beatings, you have a +25% increase to your Health statistic. This makes negative status effects much less effective when used against you. You also learned to defend yourself, and begin the game with 25 levels in Guard. However, due to running away without any training or knowledge in proffessions, you found yourself without a job, and had to take loans from the banks. You begin the game with a debt of 100,000 Gold Pieces to all of the banks in Cynosure. You are unable to purchase property or invest until all of these debts are paid in full.</p>
<p>Forge Worker - Before The Great War took place, you held a job as a forge worker. You know your way around the smelting furnaces and anvils. You begin the game with 30 levels in your Forging and Prospecting skills.</p>
<p>Chef - You were once a reknown chef, famous for creative and inventive cooking. You begin the game with 40 levels in your Culinary skill, have a 10% decreased chance to burn any food, and learn one high-tier (level 100) Culinary recipe which no others may learn. The recipe produces the most expensive pie in Cynosure, and may not be traded with other players.</p>

        <p>I’ve made many attempts to create my own video game. The amount of work needed to put into it is absolutely overwhelming.
