    <title>SilabSoft Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/silabsoft-client/409979</link>
    <description>Hello MoparScape. I post today with the problem of the SilabSoft downloadable client not working. Yes yes, I realise that this is an old subject, but for me, the SilabSoft client worked the best and achieved everything that I wanted. I&#39;ve tried alternative clients, but I&#39;ve really found nothing that matches what I personally need. Recently, I&#39;ve got back in to RSPS, but have found that upon opening the run.bat reading:

[code]java -Xmx512m -jar SilabClient.jar 0 0 highmem members 0
pause[/code]

The client simply does not open; instead returning exactly what was written with no apparent errors:

[code]C:\folder destinations&gt;java -Xmx512m -jar SilabClient.jar 0 0 highmem members 0
C:\folder destinations&gt;pause
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]

I have not edited anything in the jar or the bat since the last time that it worked and the jar is most definitely called &quot;SilabClient&quot;. I&#39;ve got the .silabclient_store_32 folder in C:\, so I&#39;m really unsure as to what the problem could be; I&#39;ve already worn out Google and so would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks in advance!</description>

<p>Heh, I was hoping that it wouldn’t have to get down to being as tedious as that, but I guess it’s the only way. Thanks for your help and taking the time to reply! :﻿)</p>

Ah yes, I probably should have mentioned; I have the latest version of JRE and JDK, and have set my the classpath. I can run other clients fine - this is the only one that has been causing me problems, which is a hassle since it’s the one I need. Any other suggestions?</p>
