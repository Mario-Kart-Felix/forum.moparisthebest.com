    <description>Hey peoplz, this won&#39;t make anyone spend a lot of time making a new one. It&#39;s an old one i can&#39;t find. It was a miner banker for Fally. You could send it to mine at the mines just above rimmington where there is iron, copper, clay and gold. You could get it to mine iron and bank it! Does anyone remember or even still have the script. If you do PLEASE POST!</description>
