    <title>ChaCha</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chacha/141639</link>
    <description>There was a thread on Chacha.com a while back and it was possibly the funniest thread, ever. Anyways I remembered about it the other day and Ive been screwing off on it for a while. 

For those that dont know, chacha.com is like a search engine but with real people searching for your stuff. So you can ask for really stupid or funny things for them to search and have fun with the guides. They made you have to register now to search with a guide, though. But its still really entertaining.

Ill start off with some Ive done while on my search for the meaning of life.
