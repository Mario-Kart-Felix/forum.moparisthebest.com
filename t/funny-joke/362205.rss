    <description>Runescape&#39;s Economy. 

Anyway sorry for the one-liner onto the real thread. Runescape&#39;s economy reminds me of a combination of the monopoly-ridden industrialism-fueled economy of the United States pre-great depression and a socialist economy similar to that of the Soviet Unions right before its collapse 

Why you ask? 

Put simply, Jagex thought it would be a good idea to take the two worst economies and combine them to create one super terrible economy. 

It&#39;s super regulated in some areas, but loosely regulated in others. The result is a crappy economy where no ones happy except for like the top 0.5% of the population that have over a few hundred mill. 

Jagex puts these regulations on the economy that cap economic growth such as, limits in how much items you can buy, and periods of time you have to wait between transaction. 

They also feel the need to jump in randomly and ***** around with the economy resulting in inflation and the Gold Piece dropping, i.e. Statuettes, Climbing boots. 

Then at the same time they allow merch clans to dominate the market, creating monopolies on items, regulating prices on their whim, not in the common consumer&#39;s interest, like how a market should be. 

tl;dr version: Runescape, your economy should be used as an example of the &quot;bad economy scenario&quot; in economics 101 or finance. KTHXBAI</description>
