Hello Can anyone help me with this:
Listen if I have in client files a folder called sprites and inside the file i got some pictures Example:
STATICONS 17.png thats mean i should maybe have this in The client.java or something ?
i mean i want to make an image called LOGINBOX.png and then add the picture to my login box at start How can i do (it its interface?) AND I USE (DELTA 317)atleast i think its delta 
idont have itemdef and stuff (src folders i dont have so i think its delta).

another Example :
what to do with the sprites if i want to add umm Bank.png and then i want it to take part in my server because in my server i dont have bank.png or something so how does its load the picture of the bank? thats what i am asking.
