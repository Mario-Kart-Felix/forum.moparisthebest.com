    <title>Hosting a 562 Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hosting-a-562-client/393110</link>
    <description>Hello, I was just about to host my 562 client, I had made my hosts and downloaded the no-ip duc, changed the client ip to my host ip, ran the server, then the client and it gets stuck (means its offline). Please someone help me. Do I have to portforward to make it work?</description>
