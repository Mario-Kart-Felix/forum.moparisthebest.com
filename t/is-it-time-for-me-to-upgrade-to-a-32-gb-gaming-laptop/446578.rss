    <description>Is it time for me to upgrade to a 32 GB gaming laptop?

About 2 weeks ago I noticed that my current netbook (1gb ram, 1.6ghz N450 dual core) suddenly slowed down. It now struggles to play videos on youtube and CPU 1 is always at 100 % load, even when no programs are open.

I&#39;m getting pissed off at this. Does anyone know some magical fix for this (Ubuntu 11.10)?

Also, would you recommend I get a 32gb ram , i7 gaming laptop? My logic is that even though I will only rarely use it for games, it should be future proofed for at least the next 7-8 years if it needs to be.</description>

Have you ran or looked at anything to try and figure out what is causing the slowdown (‘top’ from the command line is a good starting point).</p>
<p>If I assume the screenshot you posted does something like ‘top’, then judging by the 0% CPU use, yet the high system load, my guess is it is probably a IO bound problem, probably when writing/reading from the hard disk.

Oops. You need alot of RAM to work at a huge res in photoshop, got those mixed up.</p>

<p>not sure but there is very little demand for more than 8gb of ram. XBox’s only have 512mb of ram, so even 4gb on a pc is a godsend to developers. But the next consoles will have 4gb of ram</p>

              <p>Is it time for me to upgrade to a 32 GB gaming laptop?</p>
<p>About 2 weeks ago I noticed that my current netbook (1gb ram, 1.6ghz N450 dual core) suddenly slowed down. It now struggles to play videos on youtube and CPU 1 is always at 100 % load, even when no programs are open.</p>
<p>I’m getting pissed off at this. Does anyone know some magical fix for this (Ubuntu 11.10)?</p>
<p>Also, would you recommend I get a 32gb ram , i7 gaming laptop? My logic is that even though I will only rarely use it for games, it should be future proofed for at least the next 7-8 years if it needs to be.</p>
