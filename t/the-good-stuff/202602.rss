    <description>Yeah, drugs... etc.

What drugs are you into/looking forward to trying?

I myself have recently become emo over a dumb bitch of a girl, and shall now turn to drugs for an answer even though I know it won&#39;t help.
[size=5pt]OK, minus the emo part but the girl is a dumb bitch.[/size]

Anyway, PERSONALLY... I&#39;m looking forward to trying Salvia. Nothing else. I&#39;ve tried weed and oxy cotton. Weed sucks. Oxy cotton I might try again.

I&#39;ve heard many things about salvia, ranging from good to horrible. What are your views on this legal drug?


Whatever, I&#39;m stupid for being ambitious. JME I heard you&#39;re fucked. Give me your insights NOW!</description>

Uhm… In Canada I believe you need to be 19 to buy it… :S</p>
<p>Isn’t it that, the salvia trip weakens after each time you have it?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Nope. It’s completely unregulated. You need to be 19 to buy tobacco, not salvia.</p>
<p>As for tolerance, both of you are wrong <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Salvia isn’t just any drug <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Salvia actually has reverse tolerance. The more you smoke, the LESS you need and the stronger effects you will get. Usually it’ll take a few tries until you even get a good effect.[/quote]What the hell, seriously? That’s nuts.</p>
<p>I need to like, print out some legal shit from wikipedia if they try n stop me from buying it in Canada then n be all like BITCH SAY WAT</p>

<p>Nope. It’s completely unregulated. You need to be 19 to buy tobacco, not salvia.</p>
<p>As for tolerance, both of you are wrong <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Salvia isn’t just any drug <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Salvia actually has reverse tolerance. The more you smoke, the LESS you need and the stronger effects you will get. Usually it’ll take a few tries until you even get a good effect.</p>

<p>Your body will develop a tolerance to any drug you take often enough. If you’re talking about doing it once a month it shouldn’t make much of a difference at all.</p>

<p>Oh, you should have quoted pault because I thought you were talking about Uriko. I was like, where da fuck is he getting this from.</p>
<p>Well love is a pretty lousy drug then, lol. Costs a shitload of money and it doesn’t get you high. Maybe the occasional orgasm though.</p>

OxyContin? Sorry, I refer it to the street name to sound cool.</p>
<p>edit: jme kthx. I was gonna read up on it some more… I was actually gonna buy some 40x extract today for $10. Lol. I was lookin’ at the pipe’s n he was like y’wanna buy? And I looked at the salvia n was like what about this?</p>
<p>He’s like are you legal age? n I changed the topic right away… TBH all I have to say is ‘yes, but I forgot my ID at home’. Anyway I’m looking forward to trying it ;o</p>
<p>btw jme, you use a bong for it or a pipe? Which gives you the best hit;o[/quote]</p>
<p>I use a bong, but personally I don’t fill it up with water because things can get messy on salvia hehe. Also there is no legal age for salvia, it’s completely uncontrolled. Some stores may choose not to sell it though.</p>
<p>[quote=“PaulT, post:14, topic:202602”]A bong is better for salvia. A gravity bong (google it if you don’t know how to make it, it’s easy) is best.</p>
<p>Salvia is scary. At 20x I’ve had trips that lasted several years in a few minutes. It can have a big impact on the way you think and your way of life, even a long time after your trip. It isn’t always fun, in fact for me it often isn’t. Just make sure you’re sitting down.</p>

<p>That sounds awefully strong for 20x. I’ve done many massive 40x hits now, and I haven’t quite tripped for years, but usually it feels like I’ve been fucked for eternity. Like if I’m tripping out in some other reality, all my past memories are simply being in that reality and the REAL reality has never existed and I know nothing about it. [quote=“nohope, post:15, topic:202602”]Love is the only drug (As you said it was a drug) That I would do.[/quote]</p>
<p>Love isn’t a drug, and he never said it was. No idea what you are talking about. In my opinion you should do yourself a favor (and us) and stay out of the drug topics.</p>

<p>All I can really say is reading everything you can find on salvia in the erowid vaults. There is probably a really good FAQ to read on it.</p>
