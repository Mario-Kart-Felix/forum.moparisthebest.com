    <title>New Java Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-java-question/443097</link>
    <description>Hello,
Since a few days i was wondering why you see strange symbols when opening a file in my scrapbook.
Once i&#39;ve found the reason i started to try opening files in Java. Also known as: &#39;Java Web Start Launcher&#39;.
But the problem is the second, once i&#39;m trying to open a file i get the second error: &#39;Unable to launch the application.&#39;.
In this area i have 2 options; Details or cancel.. And once i&#39;m clicking on Details i can see all the information what is in the file i&#39;m trying to open. Including 2 more tabs which are &#39;Exception&#39; and &#39;Wrapped Exception&#39;.
Any idea&#39;s how to fix this?
Greetings,
