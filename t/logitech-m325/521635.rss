I recently bought this mouse as my old corded one was starting to give me some issues...

I find the mouse &quot;moderately sensitive which is a good thing. It only took a few moments to get adjusted to the new sensitivity. I am not too fond of the material on it and the mouse is somewhat &quot;small&quot; but I do have large hands as well.

The left click is very very silent while the right click does have a noise with it. 

The wheel function...is well amazing.  I am able to scroll an entire page in mere seconds with it very sensitive/powerful wheel scroll. You can hold down the mouse wheel and go left and right. You can &quot;click the wheel to the right/left to go either back a page or go forward a page&quot; I like that function a lot as well as I do a lot of generic surfing where the back button is used on forums etc.

I got the mouse for like $5 on a &quot;half a day sale&quot; which is really nice. I would suggest this mouse to any mouse enthusiast..may not be the greatest for gaming but for general purposes it&#39;s an excellent choice.

Other thoughts: It has a special feature where you can &quot;turn on/off&quot; the battery that is in it (AA). I don&#39;t know if this is a &quot;new&quot; or &quot;unique&quot; feature as this is my first real mouse purchase but it seems like a really cool thing.

I would give this 4/5 stars.</description>

<p>[/quote]Wow really? Me too! Which Best Buy? Maybe we can wait together?[/quote]no need to be sarcastic. It was a review purely for those who wanted a cheap mouse that actually worked decent.  :rolleyes:</p>
