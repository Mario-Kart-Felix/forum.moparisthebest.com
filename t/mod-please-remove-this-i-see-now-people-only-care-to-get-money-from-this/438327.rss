Additional information: I have a desktop PC sitting next to me that works perfectly, has just received a clean installation of windows XP, and basically all this PC would be doing is hosting your server. It can host 24/7 around the clock. Hold plenty of players. It will be very stable. It has nearly 100 mb/s up+down speeds. I’ve been looking for a server to host because I want to put it to good use and I don’t use it for anything.<br>
Also, I would be a beta tester and a loyal player <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Not trying to offend or do any of that content but, I need to tell you few steps that will make your server successful or get it in a big fame.</p>
<p>Ok, first of all, players will actually look at four points.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General Unqiueness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friendly community?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have just see you said “help you host”, do you mean manual hosting? Because manual hosting can hold upto 30 players maximumly and I see you use a lot of engine load &amp; memory usage. And your using project insanity which is really bad for stability.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of the server is 0% I can’t see anything unique, if you see what I mean, 1 LITTLE proof would be the home. You could of realized edge is very overused and not is actually unique at all, and the home organization seems :Fp: also I suggest you use newer shop interface,tabs, and use finally 508 maps which is really good looking. Also you need to have something wow to interact and hype your players.</p>
<p>Ah yes, you will need a friendly community because I see allways in most of the servers out there general competition Between donators and normal players I see you have allmost put a lot of features for donators, but it’s over limited. I understand you, more features = more donators, but always remmember normal players are the ones made you money.</p>
<p>Economy which is the worst I see. In a shop I see partyhats? bunny ears? Torva? Claws? Masks? Santa hats? You need to improve that also the drop rates will play a big role. And also set prices… You need to work on that.</p>
<p>This is not all, I will continue it when I’m on computer I’m on iPad haha.</p>
<p>I’m going to take a journey on all server projects and support &amp; help them as possible.</p>
<p>Peace out bro, support.[/quote]<br>
Ok 1, all servers(unless there some rich guy) usualy start out on manual hosting. 2 the shop that u say with phats is a custom point shop look at the subtitles in pictures and the points are hard to get. 3 the donators get barrelchest and super donators get frost dragons. thats not that much. 4 the home is a base it will be changed the community is deciding on one.5 the uniqueness-First off this is my first Project ever. Second- im going for Awarness before uniquness. my objective is to make a server that the community creates. Not some server that a person makes hoping that he will get cash. I want the community to know that im aware of there ideas. But sire thanks for your Umm “suggestions” but i dont care what you say unless your apart of my community. Im new to this. I run of the players itself. This Isnt my Server. this is my communitys server. They determine wether it gets big or not. But one thing i learned since starting this project. UNIQUENESS DOES NOT MATTER! the only thing that matters is the quality of the server. it dosent have to have 508+ maps or gameframes. All it needs Is entertainment and fun for its players. This isnt your server so why do you care? Ive meet people who Point out errors and actually help me and tell me how to fix them. But if your not going to help fix them then dont even post the errors. Let me Find them myself and fix them. But onething in a server that is important is a loyal community which i have and partners to help you with the server. Also another thing about uniqueness. I belive my server is unique. Why because i created IT! and also if all you look at in servers is Uniqueness then you are Very “shallow”. True and Loyal Players look FOR QUALITY! you dont have to support my server i really dont care. The Only opinion that counts is my communities. Not Yours unless i belive it counts. Thanks for the suggestions but if all u look for uniqueness in a server your not very loyal at all. Loyal players look at Quality not uniqueness. they want a server that is diffrent in quality not looks. THEY WANT A SEVER THATS FUN AND ENTERTAINING! uniquness is very low on my importance list. and one last thing! I DONT FUCKING CARE HOW MANY PLAYERS I HAVE ALL I WANT IS LOYAL PLAYERS! i dont care if its 1,30,or even 50 as long as there loyal im happy. If all you look for is quanity of quality then you my friend are “shallow”. im done thanks to moparscape for having no character amount. Also to Whattehp406, i know that.</p>

<p>Economy which is the worst I see. In a shop I see partyhats? bunny ears? Torva? Claws? Masks? Santa hats? You need to improve that also the drop rates will play a big role. And also set prices… You need to work on that.</p>
<p>This is not all, I will continue it when I’m on computer I’m on iPad haha.</p>
<p>I’m going to take a journey on all server projects and support &amp; help them as possible.</p>
<p>Peace out bro, support.</p>

Also A note to the player save the the server automatically saves the players progress every 30 seconds to a minute or before they log out. The save button is now bassically usless i no longer need it but thanks for reminding me to remove it. Also yes i know i suck at spelling when im coding.

So thank you for noticing those glitches for me. I hoped i explanied them the best i could for you.

<p>Well You kinda put me  down there.

<p>I’m not trying to put you down, every project has flaws, that’s inevitable. All in all, I don’t see progress being made in the RSPS scene, the few projects I used to have faith in have all been disbanded and any successful servers are corrupted by money now-a-days. Thanks for clearing up that pepper points thing, that makes sense, I love the idea behind those, you’re actually incorporating your passions and your players, I support that.</p>
