    <title>CacheDownloading Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cachedownloading-issue/553450</link>
    <description>Alright, so I&#39;m using the Ruse source, yes i know everyone is now, but im actually going to make something out of it not just leech it lol. But anyways, I followed Swiffys little snippet on how to change the cachedownloading over to my webhost but when I delete my cache and let it attempt to download, it completely downloads but then stops on &quot;requesting title screen&quot; and does the count downs.. I can&#39;t figure out why? I&#39;m pretty sure its all on my webhost just like he has it and the links are changed but idk any help?</description>
