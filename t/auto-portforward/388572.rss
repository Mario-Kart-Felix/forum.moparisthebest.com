    <title>Auto PortForward</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/auto-portforward/388572</link>
    <description>So I was reading this Auto Portforward tool (http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,442058.0.html) and I got everything to work except the server.java settings. If anyone can help me with this I would gladly appreciate it. I have a PI / Lost Legacy source.

[b]What I did:[/b]

Searched [code]public static void main(String[] args)[/code] and nothing came up.
I saw to the left of the picture below that it said he was on line 33 so I pressed ctrl+g and typed 33 and nothing happened.
My run and compilers are running fine.</description>
