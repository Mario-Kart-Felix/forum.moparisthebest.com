    <title>How do rs coordanates work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-rs-coordanates-work/6933</link>
    <description>im working on a memory reader for runescape, and i need some info about how runescape coordantes work. i was hoping those who used to use auto rune (before my rs cheating began unfortunately) would be able to help me. currently, i have found the values that increase / decrease as you move your character back and forth. aka, ive found the coordantes. but they only work in certain areas, when i leave the area, they stop working, and i have to search for the values again. i have a suspicion that runescape coordantes are done in areas, so each area has its own set of coordanates. when you log in, you are told what area you are in and the location within that area. is this correct, or does runescape have a global coordanate system.</description>

              <p>Dead, I’m trying to learn that too. What I’m pretty sure of at this moment, is with some scripting in a certain area you can say something like ::pos and it’ll tell you the coordinates…I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help, but I’m new to all this. Good luck anyways. And LOL at your grandpa’s signature. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>I’m pretty sure runescape stores something like bigX &amp; bigY as the coordinates of the loaded area &amp; then only has little x &amp; y which are relative to the bigX &amp; bigY, although I’m pretty sure bigX &amp; bigY don’t even have to be available client-side. Basically when you move then only the coordinates relative to the loaded area change.</p>

<p>In a way, you’re right. There’s the base x and y variables that tell the coordinates of the south-west corner of the loaded region. Then each object has an x and y variable for it’s position in that loaded area.</p>

you probably experienced moving into a different game area, i do not know why it changed.</p>
<p>but runescape has coordinates for all there items and npcs etc.</p>
<p>im 80% sure it is on a big scale</p>
