    <title>The science of questions... (and how this board works)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-science-of-questions-and-how-this-board-works/450237</link>
    <description>I adopted a board on an old forum of mine very similar to this. A few people have asked me to bring it back and I figured it would be a nice addition to MoparScape.

The logistics of this board are straightforward. If you have some complex or puzzling concept in physics, chemistry, philosophy, or anything you can fit &quot;theory&quot; into, post it here. Beware that we have high expectations for the types of posts in this board, so be sure you at least make some effort to be intelligible if you want to participate in discussion.

Any questions about this board can be messaged to me or posted as replies to this sticky. Thanks. :)</description>
