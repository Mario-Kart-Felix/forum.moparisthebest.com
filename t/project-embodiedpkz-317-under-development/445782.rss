<p>First time ever writing a thread/post like this in the first place, I want a community for my server before its up. so people can help me make decisions when i post a poll up on the forums like ‘What should be the home? lumbridge, varrock, edge, other’ But you guys can’t respect anything that other people do and always flame on other peoples stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, fuck us, we have an opinion like normal human beings.<br>
Plus no one really wants to sit around on some forums waiting for the next stupid poll just so they can wait days for the results.<br>
And I still stand by what I said, just do research beforehand that’s from fairly up-to-date sources and you’ll do fine.</p>
