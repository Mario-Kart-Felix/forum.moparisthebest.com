    <description>Ok,

     I used to play this game a long time ago, and decided that since I&#39;m bored, I&#39;ll start again. If you don&#39;t play, goto Kingsofchaos.com and register.

Now, here&#39;s what this post is for, post your unique links. It&#39;s a system. We post our unique links, and we all click on them for each other, getting us all more untrained soldiers. I&#39;ll add them to the list as you post. Even if you don&#39;t play, clicking on these would be appreciated.

The List.

<p>My friend showed me it when I used to play, and forgot the name, that’s what I modeled this off of. Do you remember the link?</p>

              <p>Oh my God, I used to waste so much time on this.  I’d do it before school, after school, during school, in the middle of the night.  I had to go on every 5 hours or so to buy like a trebuchet (?) or some defense item, so I’d have no cash and no one would want ot attack me.  Oh God what a waste of time.</p>
<p>My friend was less than 100 ranked defense, and I was close behind him.  I had a good couple thousand soldiers.</p>
<p>Buzzy, do you use Wildfire?  I used to do that until my fingers hurt.</p>
