First of all, I am a Muslim, so I know what goes around in my country, thank you very much. Have you even read the Quran? Have you done any research in an attempt to understand Islam more clearly? Unless you have, which you obviously haven’t, then all your arguments are invalid and based on assumptions.<br>

This is an example of how Muslims are treated in other countries. How fair do you find that? Saying all Muslims are bad because they could be terrorists is like saying all Americans are bad because they are the first people to use a nuclear bomb in war! It doesn’t make any sense, does it?</p>

He spent that on hiding his birth-certificate, not Osama. Much much more money was spent in finding Osama in just bombs alone (not nuclear or anything of the such, but airstrike tiny ones).</p>

<p>Ok first of all, about the muslims, they are in no fucking way peacful people, they tend to kill others for their own good, somewhere someone said that fathers need to do this stuff to be able to feed their families, well pure bool shit. They kill eachother, they kill their wives, they marry multiple women, how the fuck does that work anyway? I mean seriously, stay in your fucking country and nuke yourselves as much as you want and America shoudln’t be giving a shit about muslims unless they get attacked, but you have to fight fire with fire so I guess that’s they only reason why America should attack them muslims. Not to help them. Also, about the Russians, they are almost the same as Armenians, we’ve fought together in the past and we were both from the sovjet, so, in my point of view, Russia, will help, but only if they knew there was big danger for a massacre. (For example nukes.) Also, don’t forget the Russians aren’t the most people with quantity but they are the most quality people (in weaponary point of view). I mean who knows what nukes they have in their hands atm. And that usama dude, he’s really fucked up, that account is created in 2007, I hope he’s sad because he’s leader is dead. And I hope that they ripped his balls off.</p>

</aside>
<p>Are you going against what you said then? As I see it, you’re telling Americans to fucking attack Muslims, and you’re telling people that all Muslims are shit and should be murdered. You then went against what you said by admitting that yes, in fact good muslims do exist. You are either a hypocrite of the worst kind or just a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Also, please quote me complaining about Muslims being treated unfairly. Trust me, I live in Egypt. We’ve had the same president for 30 years, driving our country to fucking shit. I know what discrimination means.</p>
<p>Let me take your post through part by part:</p>
<blockquote>Ok first of all, about the muslims, they are in no fucking way peacful people, they tend to kill others for their own good, somewhere someone said that fathers need to do this stuff to be able to feed their families, well pure bool shit.

Where the fuck have you heard fathers need to kill sons to feed their families? Whoever told you that must be very retarded or very smart by manipulating you into believing islam is a religion which condones killing sons. What the hell does marrying multiple women have to do with being peaceful? You clearly haven't even read about the subject, because you're assuming marrying multiple women is connected to being peaceful.
<blockquote>I mean seriously, stay in your fucking country and nuke yourselves as much as you want and America shoudln't be giving a shit about muslims unless they get attacked, but you have to fight fire with fire so I guess that's they only reason why America should attack them muslims.

YES BECAUSE THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE!
You do realize that the Iraq invasion was based on pure bullshit? The claims that Saddan had nuclear weapons. Not only was there was no proof pertaining that fact, a scientist from the inside actually said that they had not found any nuclear weaponry in Iraq. You then proceeded to quote a list of terror organizations, because obviously thinking that that list reflects every fucking Muslim found on earth. /sarcasm
<blockquote>Also, about the Russians, they are almost the same as Armenians, we've fought together in the past and we were both from the sovjet, so, in my point of view, Russia, will help, but only if they knew there was big danger for a massacre.

Are you actually saying Russia will help USA if the USA is in danger of dying? Also, nuclear weaponry is seldom used in wars and assuming that having a nuke means that it will be used in a war is just dumb.

What the fuck does account creation date have to do with anything? Moparisthebest was the first guy who got on the forums, does that mean he's fucked up? You also hope that they ripped Ossamas balls off, which really reflects your extremely rational way of thinking and providing facts as backup for your arguments.

<p>Ok first of all, about the muslims, they are in no fucking way peacful people, they tend to kill others for their own good, somewhere someone said that fathers need to do this stuff to be able to feed their families, well pure bool shit. They kill eachother, they kill their wives, they marry multiple women, how the fuck does that work anyway? I mean seriously, stay in your fucking country and nuke yourselves as much as you want and America shoudln’t be giving a shit about muslims unless they get attacked, but you have to fight fire with fire so I guess that’s they only reason why America should attack them muslims. Not to help them. Also, about the Russians, they are almost the same as Armenians, we’ve fought together in the past and we were both from the sovjet, so, in my point of view, Russia, will help, but only if they knew there was big danger for a massacre.

This is an example of how Muslims are treated in other countries. How fair do you find that?

<p>I’m saying that yes there are in fact good muslims, but most of them are not.</p>
<p>Also, I never said to kill all muslims, I stated that Americans should not give a shit about them and not spend thousands of soldiers attacking muslims. I said that the only reason to attack them is when America gets attacked by muslims (nuke’s etc. etc.). Also I stated that muslims can bomb themselves as much as they want, just don’t bomb other countries.</p>

You are just as ignorant as any terrorist. Terrorists are not people who fight for their country. Have you even read the Quran? The Quran and the Prophet clearly speak about such things.
<p>Saying Israel shouldn’t exist is a stupid statement. They have the right to exist just as anybody else does. If the middle east had been any stronger, we would have been able to fight them off in 1948, 1976 and so on. They won lots of these wars, and the only one Egypt “won” wasn’t actually won. We only took 15 km of Sinai back. When I heard that number, I actually laughed irl.</p>
<p>Saying Israel and USA are the worst countries in the world is dumb as well. Look at them - they follow the principles stated in the Quran. Are they bad for doing that? No. We are bad for not being able to follow these principles, and people should be ashamed of having westerners who don’t believe in god follow the principles that should be the foundations of Islam.</p>

<p>So apparently, the jews are those innocent citizens who came in and wanted a place to live, but we didn’t want them so we just shot them.</p>
<p>I am not blaming you on thinking like that. Me and my teacher were discussing this problem a few days ago. The Israelians always make it look like the Muslims are the ones who start problems. The jews have this motto which they teach their children: “From the Euphrates to the Nile”. This means that they believe their land extends from the Euphrates to the river Nile. Apparently, all that land actually belongs to them. But where did the Egyptians go? Where did all the lands in between go? They are supposedly going back to their original land which was ruled over by Solomon ages ago. Is this really a reason to take over land?<br>
These are the official borders Israel should follow: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements</a><br>
In another war, the actually extended their borders to cover all of Palestine and also cover Sinai and a part of Syria. YES I CAN SEE THAT THEY ARE VERY OBVIOUSLY FOLLOWING RESOLUTIONS SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS</p>
<p>Now, I am not saying that they shouldn’t have the right to live. But saying that Jews are being discriminated by hostile Muslims every where is very dumb. You also say that Muslims are very unpeaceful, when our president actually initiated the peace pact which still stands between Egypt and Israel.</p>
<p>another edit: Also, funny you should be mentioning Iraq. Read a few posts before, I state how the USA has invaded Iraq for no reason at all.</p>
