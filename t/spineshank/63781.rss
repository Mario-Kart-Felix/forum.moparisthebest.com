              <p>I’ve never heard of them. I will have to check them out. What kind of music do they produce. Like compare it to another band. I just got this off <a href="http://wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow noopener">wikipedia.org</a></p>
<p>Spineshank is a four-piece nu metal/industrial metal music group from Los Angeles, California, USA. The current status of the band which is still nameless as they have decided to no longer go by the Spineshank moniker is working on a new album. It has been announced that the remaining members of the band had found a replacement for former vocalist Jonny Santos in Brandon Espinoza.</p>
