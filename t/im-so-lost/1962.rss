                          I have tried to look at forums and understand what I need to do with mopar revolution so I can auto. I am lost on if I need to get scar or does mopar have its own autoing. I dont understand if I have to download scar or will that work with mopar and right now im confussing my self so Im just going to do a short Q &amp; A if possible 
 
                          1) Does scar work with mopar revolution or does it work on its onw
                          2) What all do I need to have mopar an autoer if it will even auto
                          3) How do I run scripts on mopar (if possible)
                          4) {retorical} why am I such a noob
