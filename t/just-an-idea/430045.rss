    <description>would it be possible to make my rsps have a first person view. like a first person shooter but with a sword and shield. or would i have to make a completely new type of source and client? i think it would be a good idea if you could use arrow keys to move and pvp would require more skill rather than luck of hits. if anybody knows how i could do this. or if there is some sort of first person source and client that i could add the runescape maps to.
As i said just an idea.
