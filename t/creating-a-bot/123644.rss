    <title>Creating a bot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-bot/123644</link>
    <description>Hey im pretty much new to java .. ive read a few tuts and watched sean greasleys Tuts ... but i cant help but wondering ... how do you make a bot scriptable and give it commands that you can use to create scripts which the bot will recognise ? im not asking to be spoon fed or anything but just to be pointed in the right direction of what methods i need to use to eventually make my own bot :) i kinda wanna make a bot along the lines of ares since i like the speed .. but something along the lines of ibot pro would be cool too .. which ever would be easiest since im not exactly a java expert. 
Thanks alot :) Pez</description>

i am always open to new things, i admit my knowledge of the client is probably nothing when compared to that of semaphone, or even yourself. but if someone were to ask about something that i knew how it worked, i would give them enough information to ask more questions or find the solution themself, granted of course that they were willing to learn. but thats just my attitude, it cannot be helped if people wish to ‘whore’ information.<br>
[/quote]<br>
well frank we dont expect you to know the client better then those who code the client.  However frank we expect big things out of you.</p>

<p>I’m not going to reply and tell you simply because its easy enough to open a deob and look at some of the new things. Ollie i think has spotted some aswell. I’ve spent a lot of time over the past few days looking at these and have been up quite late each night.</p>

That will work…and it is ridiculously easy.<br>
Just remember to check the other get methods such as getDeclaredMethod and so on…<br>
A check by the client will only work for a few updates before someone releases some code that hacks the classes on the fly…then everyone will copy it and that will be that.</p>

<p>The tricky thing to do would be to make the check serverside and vary the number of methods in each version. It could still be spoofed, but it would add an extra step to updating.</p>
