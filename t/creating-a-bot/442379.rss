    <title>Creating a bot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-bot/442379</link>
    <description>Would anyone with experience in java want to team up with me in creating a bot for a 2006 runescape private server? It&#39;s emulating the good times, back in the day where you used to rush home from school to play with your friends, as in no extra gold, no extra experience and so fourth. I&#39;m pretty stoked about this server because I remember the good times of my childhood where I played this beautiful game with my friends  :D.</description>

<p>Alternatively you could use SIMBA, the SCAR replacement and just write colour clicking scripts. As private servers have no rules about botting or detection techniques you are not limited to how basic your script can be nor how inaccurate it is.

<p>All the resources you need should be somewhere around these forums, if you opt to try Simba, the SRL forums are another great resource of information.[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh well, I am pretty sure that botters will be banned here. They are emulating the servers as they were, and botting will not be acceptable. I do however still have no clue as to even get started writing a script, and I don’t know the first thing about programming  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

<p>That is sorta the idea, not quite, but sorta  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> - the problem though is that I have no experience in java programming, and every time i try to read up about it I get stuck after 5 mins and can’t concentrate about it, I can’t grasp the ideas.</p>

<p>Haha, I completely understand and respect your opinion  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> - back in the day, no, I did not bot. This time around I would like to not spend all of my time skilling. I cannot fully explain my logic to you, because my logic isn’t logical. I want to enjoy the game and play it, but I also want to bot.  :rolleyes:</p>
