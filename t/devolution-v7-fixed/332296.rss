    <title>Devolution v7 fixed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/devolution-v7-fixed/332296</link>
    <description>hello i have played and created a few servers (most of them small only like 10-15 active members) and i&#39;ve never gone big. ive noticed a horribly enormous amount of delta based servers and want to change that. i am fixing bugs and the combat system of devolution v7. (any one who has developed a devolution v7 knows what i mean). i&#39;m going to release the source once its completley noob proof. and ill keep all the good stuff for the actual programmers. (like ancients and full agility, ect.) i dont post these sort of things because i know what happens when i do, i get flamed for some reason... ha ha.

any who to the point... 

im making this post to ask any one who has played with or programmed devolution v7 to offer bugs that need to be fixed. i have a list of what i have or plan to fix so please try not to post what is already on the list tyvm =).


[ul]things that need to be fixed:
- combat system: im fixing the player vs. players problem with drops and graphics, along with the graphics problems vs. npc. they seem to not have a blocking animation in it.
- npc combat system: well the npc have a lot of bugs that i will fix. such as they will face the player when fighting and if the player dies or teleports or runs away, the npc will return to his origional position and will attack the next person to attack it, and wont randomly run away slowly. that was really annoying to me =p.
- fixing all magic: all magics will work (normal magics), from tele block to all the weakening spells. plus the god spells will be added. and all the stun spells will work (except ancients, i want that to be for programmers who know what they are doing and are not lazy, same with lunar spells). ill make it so you can toggle the teleports to cost runes or not. ill make sure all staffs can auto cast and need runes and make it so all the element staffs make it so they don&#39;t cost runes in the element they are made.
- npc clipping: ill make it so npc&#39;s wont walk through walls and put it in config to show you how you can make the npc not walk through stuff.
- barrows minigame: well this is a given... so i will make it better then most delta sources. just like runescapes =). cause its a given ha ha.[/ul]


if you know any more bugs please post them, or maybe just recommend something i should add. tyvm.
