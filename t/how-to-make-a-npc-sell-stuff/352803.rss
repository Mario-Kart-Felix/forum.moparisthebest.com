              <p>i sounded kinda dumb when i posted this, i was very sleepy.</p>
<p>what i meant to say was…</p>
<p>i am trying to add a new store. I have tried spawning different npc’s to sell things. But when i try that they already are shops. Anyways, i made a temporary solution by finding a non-important npc and making him sell what i want.</p>
<p>If someone can anwser me that would be great, Also have another question how do i change prices, on shops. everything is only 1gp.</p>

              <p>Try adding the Items id’s to the shop then compile.<br>
You probably forgot to add the one’s you want him to sell you.</p>
