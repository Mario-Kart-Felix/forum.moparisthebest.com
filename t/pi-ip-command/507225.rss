    <title>[PI] IP command?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-ip-command/507225</link>
    <description>I need to make a command that tells the user their ip, but I can only figure out how to tell the player the servers ip.
This is reallyy simple so I feel like a moron for asking, but for some reason I can&#39;t figure it out. I know how to make a getip command eg. ::getip [username], but that&#39;s to retrieve another users IP address.
All I need the command to do is to tell the player their own IP address. (For testing purposes)

Eg:
[code]
if(playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;ip&quot;){
    String ip = playersIpAddress; //playersIpAddress would be replaced by whatever method you use to retrieve the players ip...
    c.sendMessage(&quot;Your IP Address Is: &quot; + ip;
}
[/code]

Yes, I&#39;ve tried Google, for about an hour I researched this but I couldn&#39;t find anything that wasn&#39;t over-complicated xD
Just found a bunch of tutorials that aren&#39;t exactly what I need.

Thanks! Sorry if this question seems kind of newbish but I needed some help. :P

Edit:

Okay, now all I need to know is where the connectedFrom method is held. I can&#39;t find it. :\</description>

Wow I missed that one. Didn’t realize they removed it.<br>
And I know about connectedFrom, I tried at that for a while aswell but how would I put that into code? I looked around all over my source for some examples but couldn’t find anything. If you know which class the connectedFrom method held in, I could probably figure the rest out. Thanks. (:[/quote]</p>
