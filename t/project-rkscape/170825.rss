    <description>Well, me and my friend (Tramposch) have decided to start a server our selves. This is going to be completely done ourselves, programmed in C++ and integrated into our website (http://www.rkworld.info).

We dont have much in the way of plans. First we gotta build the base. That should probably take about 2 months. Then we have to build off of that by adding extra features and what not. Then the client, which will most likely be the hardest part, and that will probably take about 2 months if we work really hard.  So this will be about a 5 month project. Maybe less if it goes easier than i expect, but i think its going to be around 5 months.

Basically, we wanted to do this because we were sick of the crappy servers programmed in java that had 2 changes made from the original source. And, eventhough we have been off the scene for a while, we still care about the community. So we decided to make a whole new one. The project will be closed source until it is complete. And after that, we may only release the server as open source. This will be a nice change to the community. We just have to figure everything out in how it will run, be built, and all that. 

We dont really need help, but if you are an experience C++ programmer, we could use your help with the client (we wanna do the server ourselves). Help with the client would be appreciated. Or if you have suggestions on how to make it, run it, or whatver, that would be sweet as well. We havent ever created a game in C++ so we arent so sure how it will go. But i will post with updates regularly.</description>
