    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-dragon-claws-only-hit-twice-pi/368578</link>
    <description>I added dragon claws to my server and the spec works perfectly except for one problem.. when I attack an npc or a player it only hits 2 times.. it doesn&#39;t even have 2 other 0&#39;s it just only hits 2 numbers. Does anyone know how to fix this? I think this is server sided.. If not please move it to the client help section. I need help badly so please help Thank you</description>
