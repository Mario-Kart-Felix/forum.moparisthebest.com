No, the OP wants his stuff reviewed and contribution so why wouldn’t it be good to work agile? It blatantly looks like hes started working on 1 thing then stopped half way to work on something else.</p>

The geography part of the code wasn’t meant to be pushed because it was unfinished. There isn’t anything else in this project that is currently unfinished; everything will eventually be refractored and modified later on based on how I want my new functionality, but I’m still writing based on what I feel is best. If my knowledge isn’t good enough for this kind of task, then I’m going to increase it as I go.</p>
<p>David, based on what I’ve seen from you, it seems like you’re very experienced. So, I would really like some input on this. Instead of telling me it’s shit or not worth my time, I’d rather want to see a post from you saying what I REALLY need help on or what is pointless, or what needs added. I really listen to people who are more knowledgeable on this subject.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I know this might be asking too much from people on here, but I actually do like it when someone tells me what I’m doing wrong ONLY if they give an explanation to why it is wrong or how I can fix it. So, please give as many suggestions and feedback as possible because I actually feed on that shit</span></p>

        <p>Ok Ill spend a few minutes to make some notes.</p>
<p>ConfigSection seems like a poorly construed idea. Its purpose is not clear, and I feel like any of its actual purposes are better served other ways. Simple String-&gt;(String/Int/Boolean) pairs can be done in java.util.Properties, JSON, etc and more complex types should really be saved different ways. Creating a new ADT for it seems very over-engineered.</p>
<p>The extension module concept is not something anyone would use. The only time you would be trying to add extensions (in the same language) through file loading like you are doing without just including them in the project is when you have a launched project that other people cannot modify. If someone is working on a RSPS source, why would they use an external library to add other external code rather than just add the other code?</p>
<p>The way you’ve designed your static container handlers is again, over-engineered. It is better to just have flags for the function of a container that can be changed any time, and check those flags in an add/remove method.</p>
<p>You should look into how area.add(shape) works, because Im pretty sure it wouldnt function the way you want it to. (could be wrong on this one)</p>

Creating a new ADT for it seems very over-engineered.</p>
<p>The extension module concept is not something anyone would use. The only time you would be trying to add extensions (in the same language) through file loading like you are doing without just including them in the project is when you have a launched project that other people cannot modify. If someone is working on a RSPS source, why would they use an external library to add other external code rather than just add the other code?</p>
<p>The way you’ve designed your static container handlers is again, over-engineered. It is better to just have flags for the function of a container that can be changed any time, and check those flags in an add/remove method.</p>
<p>You should look into how area.add(shape) works, because Im pretty sure it wouldnt function the way you want it to. (could be wrong on this one)[/quote]<br>
The point in creating the ConfigSection class was to parse YML and write YML to and from a Map class so that all the data based on YML is readable by key and value.</p>
<p>The extension module’s purpose is so that you can have multiple projects, such as a PK server and maybe Economy server going on at the same time and allows for code not to effect the core project, because if that happens and you decide you want to re-write your ginormous system you just wrote around the project, you will have to find each of those classes throughout your core project and replace them. The extension module helps with that because it separates features that can have intentions of being re-written or removed to make it easy.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you had a server completely based around zombie survival and you’ve changed nearly every class around just to fit this type of server. If you wanted to change the entire server from a zombie survival to just a basic RuneScape emulation while still keeping your core components and utility classes, you will have to go through and change nearly every file to accomplish that. With the extensions, you can just remove the zombie survival modules and replace it with the RuneScape emulation modules and the task is done.</p>
<p>Now, the ContainerHandler class was written just as you suggested to me, but I figured that certain things or events might have to take place based on different containers. So, I changed it up.</p>
<p>You’re very right about the area system I had just started on. As I go through and test my implementations, I will fix whatever bug I find.</p>
<p>I really like that you’ve mentioned me over-engineering things. I do believe that categorizing things and making code readable is great, but I guess overloading on my code is a bit pointless. I’m actually grateful that you’ve told me all of this because I really need insight on what I’m doing. I can’t learn the way I want to if I’m being told I’m shit if I don’t know what it is that makes it that way.</p>
