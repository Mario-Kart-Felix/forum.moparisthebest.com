    <title>RSPS Library</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-library/554989</link>
    <description>The idea of this &quot;RSPS Library&quot; is to simplify the core and content creation of private servers as well as make it easy. and I started on this hoping that I could one day see multiple programmers using this API for their servers. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t believe I can do this alone. I would really like other programmer&#39;s help in getting opinions and suggestions over this entire source. I would like it if everything didn&#39;t think I&#39;ve gotten my hopes up on this and would really like some motivation from encouragement.

I realize I don&#39;t have much for commenting, but I can go back and do that as I go. Any way, why not just have a look at some of the things being worked on?

<p>ConfigSection seems like a poorly construed idea. Its purpose is not clear, and I feel like any of its actual purposes are better served other ways. Simple String-&gt;(String/Int/Boolean) pairs can be done in java.util.Properties, JSON, etc and more complex types should really be saved different ways. Creating a new ADT for it seems very over-engineered.</p>
<p>The extension module concept is not something anyone would use. The only time you would be trying to add extensions (in the same language) through file loading like you are doing without just including them in the project is when you have a launched project that other people cannot modify. If someone is working on a RSPS source, why would they use an external library to add other external code rather than just add the other code?</p>
<p>The way you’ve designed your static container handlers is again, over-engineered. It is better to just have flags for the function of a container that can be changed any time, and check those flags in an add/remove method.</p>
<p>You should look into how area.add(shape) works, because Im pretty sure it wouldnt function the way you want it to. (could be wrong on this one)[/quote]<br>
The point in creating the ConfigSection class was to parse YML and write YML to and from a Map class so that all the data based on YML is readable by key and value.</p>
<p>The extension module’s purpose is so that you can have multiple projects, such as a PK server and maybe Economy server going on at the same time and allows for code not to effect the core project, because if that happens and you decide you want to re-write your ginormous system you just wrote around the project, you will have to find each of those classes throughout your core project and replace them. The extension module helps with that because it separates features that can have intentions of being re-written or removed to make it easy.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you had a server completely based around zombie survival and you’ve changed nearly every class around just to fit this type of server. If you wanted to change the entire server from a zombie survival to just a basic RuneScape emulation while still keeping your core components and utility classes, you will have to go through and change nearly every file to accomplish that. With the extensions, you can just remove the zombie survival modules and replace it with the RuneScape emulation modules and the task is done.</p>
<p>Now, the ContainerHandler class was written just as you suggested to me, but I figured that certain things or events might have to take place based on different containers. So, I changed it up.</p>
<p>You’re very right about the area system I had just started on. As I go through and test my implementations, I will fix whatever bug I find.</p>
<p>I really like that you’ve mentioned me over-engineering things. I do believe that categorizing things and making code readable is great, but I guess overloading on my code is a bit pointless. I’m actually grateful that you’ve told me all of this because I really need insight on what I’m doing. I can’t learn the way I want to if I’m being told I’m shit if I don’t know what it is that makes it that way.</p>

The geography part of the code wasn’t meant to be pushed because it was unfinished. There isn’t anything else in this project that is currently unfinished; everything will eventually be refractored and modified later on based on how I want my new functionality, but I’m still writing based on what I feel is best. If my knowledge isn’t good enough for this kind of task, then I’m going to increase it as I go.</p>
<p>David, based on what I’ve seen from you, it seems like you’re very experienced. So, I would really like some input on this. Instead of telling me it’s shit or not worth my time, I’d rather want to see a post from you saying what I REALLY need help on or what is pointless, or what needs added. I really listen to people who are more knowledgeable on this subject.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I know this might be asking too much from people on here, but I actually do like it when someone tells me what I’m doing wrong ONLY if they give an explanation to why it is wrong or how I can fix it. So, please give as many suggestions and feedback as possible because I actually feed on that shit</span></p>

Development does not seem structured and it does not seem like you’re putting a lot of effort into making this good. Split tasks and take your time with each part. Perfect each section before continuing.</p>

As much as I can agree that it may <span class="bbcode-b">seem</span> that way, what if I write this and end up having a couple of programmers releasing sources with my library used for referencing? I know it wont be much, but I believe it would be pretty neat. I’m still doing this just for fun and it’s not the only project I’m focusing on at all.</p>
<p>Currently, this is all you need to do to for the handshake to get to the point of login. Whether you disagree with the design or not, it is still very short code and does just fine for stability. It also supports multiple revisions ;). So doesn’t is seem like an interesting concept? If anyone doesn’t like the code I have written, then I would love it if they told me what they think is wrong or suggested a different approach.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class ServerTest {

Why is it you never explain the redundancy you find in my code? I’m more than glad to change my code based on reasonable opinions.</p>
<p>I haven’t documented the code enough for someone to understand, but what exactly do you think I wrote that class for? I wrote it for things like an EntityList that Graham had written a long time ago, and anything that has an index. This is probably the fastest way for a list to be searched or modified that I know of.</p>

<p>the microsystems of an rsps are usually based on one another. developpers cant swap one part of their code out without it undermining all the rest of the system.<br>
this means they have to pick between your content framework or their own. I have yet to see people use an external lib for an rsps other than for networking and parsing data to/from files</p>

              <p>Wow! Really amazing. But, as I’m a newbie on RSPS development, sorry for this questions.</p>
<p>Can we use this like a API?<br>
Can we full compile into a single .jar and use it on my IDE?<br>
Once running, this representates a <span class="bbcode-i">server</span> that a <span class="bbcode-i">client</span> uses to work?<br>
Looking for your library we able to start creating scripts of a skill, for example?<br>
For the scripts tests can we use any <span class="bbcode-i">compatible</span>* client? *If yes, what’s the version expected to this code?</p>
<p>Currently I’m getting some knowledge about these concepts. Thank for support in advance! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Alright, so certain things have been revised.</p>
<p>So, explaining the <span class="bbcode-b">Module System</span>:</p>
<p>[left][i]Modules are jarred projects loaded by the ModuleLoader class. They are to separate certain features from the core project so we do not implement classes that will be unwanted or changed in the future. They are not meant for specific creation of certain things. Modules are literally just class files loaded into the VM from a jar and are not Scripts.</p>
<p>For example, if I implement a combat system inside of the core project, I will most likely write around the core project’s files, which I don’t want. If I separate the system to a Module, then it will not effect the core and I can disconnect it from the module loader if I wish to remove or change the combat system to something entirely new.</p>
<p>This is aside from a script or content system, but can definitely help with it.[/i][/left]</p>
<p>Also, it has nothing to do with the <span class="bbcode-b">Event System</span> (<span class="mention">@lare69</span>). I had just noticed you were referring to that. Basically, we can program on multiple different projects using the core project as a referenced library, package all of those separate projects into multiple jars, and load them into the server if need be. If we had a collection of modules that are meant purely for a pk server and we wanted a pure pk server, then we would package all of the pk modules inside of the modules folder, remove all of the previous modules, and wallah! We have a pk server, but we still have our previous economy server modules waiting if we want to use them later.<br>
[/quote]<br>
that makes a lot more sense. i was under the impression otherwise because of the documentation (in it, you refer to the modules as plugins) so you should probably rewrite it to make it a bit easier to understand[/quote]<br>
Every once in a while I’m going to scan through the source and document every undocumented piece of code. I’m really glad you took the time to give me opinion over things by the way <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I have removed the Action system and I will write a synchronized system. I have re-written the Tickable system only slightly and it’s not on the 600ms timing because I don’t necessarily believe we have to emulate that part.</p>
