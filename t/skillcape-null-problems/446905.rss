    <title>Skillcape null problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skillcape-null-problems/446905</link>
    <description>So i&#39;ve been trying to use guardian(dodian remake base) and everything seemed good enough to the point where i can fix it to the way i like it. But i ran across a huge problem....the skillcapes come up as nulls. I&#39;ve found a client that has skillcapes: [URL=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,407110.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,407110.0.html[/URL]

But they still come up as nulls....so Does this mean it&#39;s server side? I found them in my item config as the correct id and don&#39;t know where to go from there, if anyone can help that&#39;d be great</description>
