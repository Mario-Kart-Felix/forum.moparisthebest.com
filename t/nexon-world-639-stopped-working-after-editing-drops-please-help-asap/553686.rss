    <description>I&#39;ve spent a massive amount of hours editing files &amp; I think I may have now messed up badly? I don&#39;t know any techy terms &amp; such but whenever I try to Run.bat now it won&#39;t load &amp; when I try to run drop editor now to change drops back it won&#39;t open either (It&#39;s worked hundreds of times before, though this last time I had changed a lot of drop tables, including the Rare Drop table?). SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME &lt;3  ;-; !!!</description>
