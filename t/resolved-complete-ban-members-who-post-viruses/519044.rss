    <title>[RESOLVED - COMPLETE] Ban members who post viruses!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-complete-ban-members-who-post-viruses/519044</link>
    <description>I think we should just ban members that post viruses and other crap because as a leecher myself I would like to be able to leech a server in peace without having a pro hacker make me pay for his amazing source by keylogging and taking the money from paypal or taking my runescape account alongside stealing other information. 

Just making it a safer place :)</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>If someone is posting malicious content beyond a reasonable doubt, they should be banned permanently from the sight. This is in the recommended guidelines for moderators with ban powers. Nevertheless, there are multiple levels of banning. If someone posts 2-3 topics with potentially malicious content, I usually will mute them at 100% and see if they come back in 2 weeks to do it again. If they do, they will be banned completely from the site. This isn’t the required behavior of the moderators, but it is what I do personally. Do what you see fit, as long as the member does not have access here anymore. It’s pretty obvious that if a member is trying to hurt other members, they shouldn’t be here anymore. I see no reason not to ban them from this site.</p>
<p>This is what  we have always done and it’s what we’ll continue to do.</p>

<p>Yeah, this. I banned him a while ago. It depends on the situation really, I’d +70 a member that is well-known and usually doesn’t act in that way(if there’s a possibility that his account was compromised) however I would ban a member that is new to the forums and only joined with malicious intent.</p>
<p>I disagree with you if you think that every member should be banned for posting malicious content, it is dependent on the situation and the moderators discretion.</p>

If you provide examples then it’ll be sorted out. Another problem is someone will see that and not report it, if you don’t report it we more than likely won’t see it and ultimately nothing will be done.</p>

<p>Got an example?</p>
<p>Because right now everyone who posts them is banned for life. Mods are not doing their job if they are just locking it.</p>
