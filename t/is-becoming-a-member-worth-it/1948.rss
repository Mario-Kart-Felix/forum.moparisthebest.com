    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-becoming-a-member-worth-it/1948</link>
    <description>Well just like the question says, I&#39;ve been pondering this for a while now because its damned tempting for a main.

Leave comments as to why you think it is/isnt worth it :D.

              <p>The only place I know of is Reinet.  I’d have to buy it for you though, since they aren’t letting anyone else join right now.</p>
<p>What happens is, someone gets a pin by calling a 1 800 number and the number charges so much toward your phone bill, and they give you a pin.  You go to RS and type in the pin and you get a month of membership.</p>
<p>On the forum the seller gives his pin to a middle man, the buyer gives the money to the middle man, then he tells you the pin, then gives the money to the seller.</p>
<p>Right now some guy is giving unlimited membership for 6 mil.  I don’t know if I’d go for that or not, though.  He’s a vet and used to be the admin of the place, and alot of people are swearing by him, but I’d be a bit weary of it.</p>
<p>Most of the pins are 1.2 to 1.4mil each.[br][size=1]Posted at: April 28, 2006, 12:30:57 am[/size][hr]Oh sorry, this is how it works:</p>
<p>Buying a PBP PIN <span class="hashtag">#:</span></p>
<p>[1] - Get a seller!<br>
[2] - GET A MM! It takes a while to get everything set up, so after you find a PBP seller, find a MM.<br>
[3] - Once you, the seller, and the MM are all in the same MSN conversation, give the MM the Cash/Item(s)/Character(s) that you are trading for the PIN.<br>
[4] - After that you tell the MM the character’s username and password you want to get p2p on.<br>
[5] - Then the MM gets The Country, The Phone # &amp; The PIN # from the seller.<br>
[6] - Now the MM logs on your character &amp; makes it p2p. If everything works, he gives the Cash/Item(s)/Character(s) to the seller.</p>

              <p>being a member is total worth it, there is this cool plave called the fight cave, u can fight over and over each time u die u lose nothing and spawn outside, so u can level like hell using it, then you can use the tokkul they give u for choas runes at the rune store. also the member quest reward you so much better, and silk sells at 60gp each!!! plus you get to make your own arrows, and you can law run for free law runes… wow being a member is AWSOME</p>
<p>oh and that not all you can do</p>
