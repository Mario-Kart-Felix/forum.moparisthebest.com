    <title>Photoshop User Survey</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/photoshop-user-survey/82435</link>
    <description>I&#39;m just creating a quick survey before I do anything with Spiced-FX. 

Question 1. Would you use a big graphics resource site? Brushes, Renders, C4Ds, Stocks ect. 1,000+

Question 2. If &#39;Yes&#39; to above, what would you like to see on this site?

Question 3. Would you prefer to have a forum, or not to have a forum?

Question 4. Do you have any other suggestions?</description>

              <p>I would want recources, but not loads of crap ones mixed with good ones, maybe like on gamerenders…If there is somone new to rendering and has started making packs his/her packs would go into the - Normal Render Packs - And if an Awsome renderer was making packs, and it was good, it would go into the - Good render Packs -.</p>
<p>I would want a forum, so if you had recources you could comment on them and maybe post sigs that they had made with them, and maybe give pointers on how to render better, add effets at the end and so on.</p>
<p>If it was graphics based i wouldn’t have the Programing section, i’d want it all graphics, and be trying to get different people into GFX, different sections for different people, like, <em>Spiced-Fx Starter</em> at the beggining, and when your improving, and have got got better they would go to the next section, <em>Regular at the Joint</em>…And in the end they would become <em>Spiced-Fx Legend</em> and that would take so many improvments until there so ownage…And maybe a test of every section, or a vote, to see who would go up. Say if it was Kaza vs Mr.chris to go up, we would both make a gallery of our 5 best sigs from that section and see who deserves to up, and other people could vote.</p>
