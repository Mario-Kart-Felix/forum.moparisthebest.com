    <title>Appreciate help with choosing a CMS/Portal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/appreciate-help-with-choosing-a-cms-portal/72970</link>
    <description>I am in need of a flexible CMS/Portal software which will be used for a fairly large number of websites. Above all, it needs to be well coded (I will most likely be heavily modifying it), as flexible as possible &quot;out of the box&quot;, easy to theme, and not too expensive (free is always good, but if not cheap, like I said a fairly large number of websites). I would also like to steer clear of anything that uses absurd resources. Any suggestions?</description>
