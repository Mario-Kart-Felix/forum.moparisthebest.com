    <title>Free Working, Custom Sprites, Webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/free-working-custom-sprites-webclient/264027</link>
    <description>Right now I am working on a virsion for low detail, so if some people just can&#39;t handle the 15mb cache, I will make it around 6-8mb. Soon to be released.

Updating Download Link - http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?ihnjoyynzht

Client Update December 22nd 2008

Added Saradomin, Bandos, Zamorak, and Armadyl Godbows
Updating cache downloading.
Made the client better.
Anti massing.
Added Skillcape, 3rd age, bandos, and armadyl models into the cache. I will NOT release my methods on how to do that.



Please note, this is the ONLY webclient that actually works with custom sprites. It took me a while to make it, so please don&#39;t leach. If you don&#39;t trust me, go to (removed preview link) (updated) to see that it will download the cache (with the percentage) and then load up. After the cache is done downloading you have to reload the page.


FLAME ME AND I WILL REMOVE THIS SO QUICK, IT WILL MAKE YOUR BALLS SPIN.

(pictures will be updated at some other point.)
Downloads:

http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?ihnjoyynzht (UPDATED!)

So... Why am I doing this? Because I have been working on this for a long time, and finally got it to work. I have also seen many people asking for a webclient to put on their site, so I decided to help. If you want me to host it, I will. Just add my msn: hatatama666@hotmail.com.

Well that&#39;s it. All you have to do to the client is edit the IP and jar and sign it. The jarsigner can be found here: http://www.mediafire.com/?fuhhqzja5j3

If you add me on MSN and you need support, I will help you to the best of my ability. If you did not post on here, I will NOT help you. So post before adding me.

Also, as the first &quot;real&quot; &quot;silab&quot; webclient that actually works, that was posted on here, it would be nice to get this stickied  


Oh by the way, there is one other surprise for you. They have ALL silab items.
