    <title>Help with making a client, got so far and then i get this</title>

Well basically I never got this error before while executing my .jar file. Until I started including cache files and class files into my .jar

Maybe I am not supposed to add the client.class file? or client.java file?

Because normally I was just able to make &quot;client&quot; the main class, but now its not working. Whats wrong?</description>
