    <description>So this guy named James Lee stages a save-the-planet protest at the Discovery Channel headquarters, but is arrested and put on 6-month probation for disorderly conduct. Apparently he was paying homeless people to start up conflicts in the area. Then, on September 1st, 2010 he goes to the Discovery channel headquarters armed with two firearms with an IED strapped to his chest and takes the employees as hostages. But before he could cause any real harm, he got his head blown off by a sniper.

Anyway the reason I made this thread was because I found the website where he listed his demands/manifesto.

It&#39;s honestly nonsense, I find it funny that he&#39;s protesting against Discovery channel which is more likely to be aligned with his ideology compared with a right-wing conservative show

<p>This is a more reasonable explanation.</p>
<p>“He got his head blown off by a sniper”</p>
<p>That sounds like a rumor in kindergarten…</p>
