    <title>Can someone help me with portforwarding issues please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-help-me-with-portforwarding-issues-please/368507</link>
    <description>I have 2 computers, my laptop and my old computer that I used to use to run servers or bot on.

When I portforward on my laptop, it works great. The port is open, etc. But when I try to portforward on my old computer, the ports won&#39;t open. I am asking for someone to help me out please.

If you can help please reply ASAP.</description>
