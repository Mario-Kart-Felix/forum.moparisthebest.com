    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-think-i-got-it-do-you-agree/22970</link>
    <description>Ok earlier I posted a topic asking what was wrong with this,

[img]http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/2619/deathartilleryissuehelpty8.png[/img]

It kept getting the java.lang.OutOfMemory error when ever I started the server and one person joined, well i added ALOT of things to the server..

So I tried another source and..IT WAS FINE!!

So i think the problem is that I have to much stuff on my server, do you think im right?</description>

              <p>No, its how your compiling it</p>
<p>You probably have something like</p>
<p>Java -Xm521x -cp.;./SERVERDIRECTORY/</p>
<p>See the -Xm512x ? Thats a cap on the amount of memory you let the server use.</p>
<p>Make it something like -Xm2048x or remove it entirely.</p>
