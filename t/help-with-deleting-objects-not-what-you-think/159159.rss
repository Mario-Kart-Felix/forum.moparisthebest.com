    <description>Hi, im th3h1tm4n, ryan, dont care wat u call me. Erm... i normaly stick with clients so im not to good with servers... I have added a few models onto my client and i want to create an area using them. I know how to add global objects but first i want to delete all existing global objects within a certain area. There is about 900 squares in the area that need deleteing. I was wondering if anyone had a code to delete in a range of cordinates.. or if someone had a command to delete them like ::deleteobjects coordX coodY.

These are the cordinates and i need everything within the square to be deleted..

delete everything from coords

x = 2501 to 2535
y = 3355 to 3388


thank you :)[br][size=1]Posted on: November 18, 2007, 03:07:57 PM[/size][hr]anyone?</description>
