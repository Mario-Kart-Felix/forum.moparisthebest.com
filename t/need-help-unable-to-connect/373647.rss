    <title>Need help unable to connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-unable-to-connect/373647</link>
    <description>Alright, i might seem like a noob, but i&#39;m not ^^ Alright, so, heres my problem.
I have my ip set up and everything, yeah. i know how to portforward and everything.
i took a break from rsps for a long time. ive had my own server for about 2 years.
Yeah, I know i know.
Alright, so.. whenever i try to connect to my exactly IP, on the client, it waits about 2 seconds and says error connecting to server.
as in like, really fast, not so it waits about 30 seconds then says it.
So, i try logging in with my ip, 127.0.0.1 instead, and it works. so it has nothing to do with the client not working with the server.
No idea why it wont let me connect, its just wierd because its error connecting to server every 1 second XD this has been happening for awhile now, ive never had this problem.
So, i tried using the Uneditted client of this same client, and it didnt work.
Please help me.</description>
