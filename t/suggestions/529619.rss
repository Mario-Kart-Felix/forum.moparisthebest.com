    <description>Hey guys.

Since my mum and dad want me to get a job, I came up with the idea to just do computer services for people that aren&#39;t that handy with computers. I&#39;m not like a complete computer freak or something but I know what I&#39;m doing and I just enjoy doing it. Oh well, getting a little off-topic, here&#39;s my concern: 

I know my way around websites and programming them decently, I just need idea&#39;s to make my website look professional yet attracting. I plan on using Bootstrap to do that (I prefer Bootstrap above any other framework). It doesn&#39;t has to be like the best website, I just want it to look decent, professional and function well.

Please feel free to post any suggestions! I will keep this thread updated.

Thanks!</description>

<p>What kind of services are you offering? Is it local, remote or both? Do you have any ideas as for colors? A little more detail please:)</p>

<p>I’m doing local. I might move on to both later, but not yet. I’m thinking of light, fresh colors. I plan on using white and green :).</p>
