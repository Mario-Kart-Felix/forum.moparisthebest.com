    <description>I have left, came back, multiple times for around three years now and I have not went into one certain language to learn throughout the whole time. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to learn, because I do. 
I would appreciate everyone&#39;s opinion on THEIR favorite language they have learned/worked with before and the most decided by all of you, I will dedicate myself into learning to my full extent. I am now 16, and have been interested in programming since around 10. I really want to go to college and study in CS. This will help me in the long run, thanks in advance to this community.</description>

<p>Java is a great starting language.  Simple to grasp, verbose structure (comparable to written English, if you will).  Then I’d move onto Ruby because it’s fuckin’ gr8.</p>

<p>I like that. I’d kill to avoid C++! When you think about it: if you take out pointers, structs, unions and a few other keywords, Java’s basic procedural structure is identical to C.</p>
<p>I had a pure java module, I’m doing a mainly java, tad of C module now and I believe I shall be using scheme for my next programming module. I’m echoing what’s been said but first start of with a language like C/C#/Java but also dip into and be familiar with a few others. Stuff like lisp, ruby, python are all nice to play around as it’s a completely different style to the aforementioned languages.</p>

<p>Hmm, my first unit was Java which was also an introduction to professional programming practice. Next programming unit is C/C++.</p>
<p>Java would be my recommendation, that or C.</p>
