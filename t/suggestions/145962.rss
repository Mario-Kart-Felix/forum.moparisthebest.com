    <description>Dunno if these have been asked before, but I&#39;ll give it a shot.


First..
I think we should expand the programming section, maybe into sub-sections as Visual basics, c++, etc.
It gets someone annoying when I&#39;m trying to learn something, and it goes from language to language, and so on.
It might work out for people wishing to learn a specific thing.

Second..
Theres a board here called &quot;RS Private Servers&quot;
One topic that re-directs to moparisthebest.com
I think it should be at the top of the forum(for the people who don&#39;t want it, hide it)
That way they will be re-directed, and(hopefully) will stay off these forums, or completely removed.


Well, my ideas.</description>

How about the board is hidden when your a “member”? So after you have posted a decent a amount, you know where your going and staying. Like the post count member.<br>
[/quote]<br>
That is also a good idea and easy to do.  Consider it done.[/quote]<br>
Glad i could help :).</p>

              <p>First:<br>
If you look in the general programming section, you will still see topics that haven’t been posted in since September 11th, and they look to be all uniformly distributed between Delphi, C++, and VB.  That means the section isn’t very active as is with at least 3 languages in it, so it is not nearly active enough to be split off into different sections right?</p>
<p>Second:<br>
I never really thought about it and just left the board where it was before the move, but it could work and so I will try it, thanks. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>For the second:</p>
<p>When I was admin on kait’s, i recommended a forum layout change for this reason (only it was aryan at the time) and kait said have at it.  He wanted me to leave the general at the topc because he wanted it to be the catchall of the stupid posts so I did.  It worked quite well, I had to move much less threads than before.</p>
<p>For the first:</p>
<p>By sorting these out, there would be about 10 threads in some sections.  So how it is now should be perfectly fine, as long as whoever started the thread says what language it is in the subject.</p>
