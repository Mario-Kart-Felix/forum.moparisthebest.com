    <description>SUPER STOKED TO SEE THIS!!!!

*https://twitter.com/xH2Os/status/494905687390957570* Is that okay? If not please remove :P It contains a blog link in the twitter post. Wasn&#39;t sure if the twitter post was okay. It is from Alex Waters who is an avid Bitcoin Advocate. He also has been featured on Bloomberg and other news websites.

Not sure if promoting people like him is considered publicizing. If it is Idk what else to do. :( Didn&#39;t wanna junk my first thread though. I do chalk this up to an EPIC fail though. :P

What do you guys think?

I thought this was worthy of a first post here on Mopar. :)

Other then that, I am deathmaul although I have many names. Hope to have an enjoyable stay here on the forums. Used to love the RSPS servers and thinking about getting back into Runescape as well.

Good luck to you all in your adventures. :)</description>

<p>Yes, I am planning on staying. How is this advertising though? It isn’t linked to anything but a website… Or is linking not allowed?</p>
