    <description>Hey, i upgraded to the 728 cache.

Everything is good, except for the donator/extreme donator crowns.

In the 723 cache they were there, now they are not.

So i downloaded the sprites editor from Steven from RS

And i opened my 728 cache and went to the image 1455 (friend told me)

And i saw 7 models, 2 of them were jagex crown + mod crown.

So i clicked on &#39;&#39;add new sprite&#39;&#39;

and added a new sprite, but the spirte (donator crown) was 2 times bigger then the jagex crown, so maybe thats the problem?

I clicked on, pack to cache and he packed.

And i compiled my server and runned it, but still no crowns.

Anyone has a idea?

And if you know where to get a donator crown, extreme donator crown, please let me now.</description>
