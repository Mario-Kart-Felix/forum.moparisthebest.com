    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creat-a-rsps-server/389766</link>
    <description>i have tried making a server myself a few times but it just will not launch for me so i am going to pay a coder to create me a server, i want it to be the old 317 server like bak in the day but with d claws + spec, also with a lil tut on how to create new items + how to edit items alrdy there, an anti spam mod, a working ban system, pk points, all skills working normaly (just the normal skills no new things like summoning), a world chat and a donater rank for ppl who donate (also with a green crown nxt to there name in chat). all admin commands working (also would like to know how to assign/remove the commands of the diff ranks), i would really like it to be anti spawn/dupe, all tele in wildi disabled unless out of combat XD hate telers lol. plz email me on ryanwbadcock@gmail.com, pm me or comment on this, you can suggest a price if it is reasonable. also when the server is finishd could i plz get lil tutz on how to edit all diff things in the game, i just dont really hav the time to learn coding atm but really want a server that works properly and that i could build on =D tyvm for any1 that is interested

i am australian so any1 in aus who can do it you can contact me on or my email listed above

also i forgot to add i would really like a custom client and the server name would be Viciouz Wishez</description>
