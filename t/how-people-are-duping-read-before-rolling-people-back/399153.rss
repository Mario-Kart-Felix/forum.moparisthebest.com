    <title>How people are duping - read before rolling people back</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-people-are-duping-read-before-rolling-people-back/399153</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sure this is rather obvious, but we need a way to counter-act it.

Player A (duper) places some blocks they want to dupe (probably diamond)
They create a new account, and destroy those blocks, as well as some others so that they get reported for griefing. They put the diamond blocks in a password chest so that they are saved
Then then get rolled back, and the blocks they destroyed are there again, but the blocks in the chest are there as well. You now have duped. They get back on Player A account and take the blocks from the chest, and mine the rolled-back blocks again.

I don&#39;t see how we can counter act this without checking IPs before rolling back. Any suggestions?</description>

<p>That’s right, but you can certainly find a big supply of it in your mine and do the same thing, can you not?</p>
<p>edit:<br>
I want to post these publicly as well, so people know not to build in unprotected areas with diamond blocks or similar.</p>

<p>EDIT: I’ve thought of something if you removed the password chest option this wouldn’t be a problem at all and people could use /lwc -c private <a class="mention" href="/u/playername">@playername</a> instead. Also the only people who would really use password chest are people who change accounts a lot e.g ban evaders.</p>

<p>But I still think it should log changes, because that way we can still find griefers. Just not rollback-able.</p>
