hey guys i have vista and i was having so much problems running and compiling server/clients etc.... if anyone is having this trouble just want to help you out. first check if you have a program files (x86) cuz if you do most likely your jdk and stuff will go here no to original program files cuz some reason vista has a lock on program files (did for me) even though im using admin account.

~variable name~------------- ~~~value~~~
CLASSPATH------------------CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_13\bin;%CLASSPATH%;
PATH------------------------C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_13\bin

If that doesnt work just add the same thing to top section and bottom section and change the jdk1.6.0_13 change the 13 to the version u have my advice just go download newest one its easiest way but you can just change to your current version (found in add or remove programs in my computer fastest way) then in you compiler put this



@echo off
Title Compiler
&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_13\bin\javac.exe&quot; *.java
pause 



once again change the 13 to what ever you put in the path and class path in system variables or leave it like that if you took my advice and downloaded newest one.

then try compiling and running it should work but if no ill paste whats in my run also

@ECHO OFF
color 07
echo Ythehellscape server client!
echo I really have no clue who made this but i edited it &quot; ythehell &quot; lol
JAVA -Xmx500m EGUI


dont mind what it says lol just paste it (~~~only if yours doesnt work~~~)

Thats about it folks i really hope it works its not fair that people cant have fun because vista is being stupid please reply telling me if its good or bad or horrible or great.

Please guys please post if you have problems understanding or still doesnt work after this we might get it to work

HOPE IT HELPED!!!!</description>
