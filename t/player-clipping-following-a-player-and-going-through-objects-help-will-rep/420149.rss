    <title>Player Clipping! (Following a player and going through objects) HELP! Will Rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-clipping-following-a-player-and-going-through-objects-help-will-rep/420149</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve looked many places and can&#39;t seem to find a tutorial that can fix my problem.

I need to fix my server (but I heard the problem was client sided?) so players can&#39;t follow each other and walk through objects like walls etc.

If someone could help me out on this it would be tremendously appreciated and you will receive a rep++ in return and added into the ::credit command on my server.
