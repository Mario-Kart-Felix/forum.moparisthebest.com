    <description>So I downloaded houlahscape and finally got it to work..
I noticed soome strange things with private servers... Not a lot of stuff works..
I see that you cannot talk to NPC&#39;s and I wasnt sure where to add my own npc chatting stuff...
Some of the models were partially warped for me, I guess there must have been some corruption while decompiling or something..
I could create npc&#39;s while connected as admin, but when I attempted to attack the black dragon I had spawned, the client had a java.lang error... I could attack the black dragon which the server had spawned with no troubles.
A lot of NPC&#39;s were missing.. I take it that someone manually added the NPC&#39;s I could see in lumbridge, because some of them would not walk.. The walking part wasn&#39;t set up properly for them I think..

Well since I&#39;m new to this whole server thing, it would be nice if someone could kindly explain or confirm those few things..</description>

              <p>Krazy_Meerkat, it’s not like these are all “Bugs” or something; a the homebrew servers are built from the skeleton of a server outward. Everything in the game has to be coded in. So if somethings messed up or not there, it means the programmer who coded it couldn’t get it to work.</p>

              <p>I noticed in houlahscape, the walking was set wrong for the goblins… It had 0 then all the range stuff… The range stuff should be before that 0, then 0 for static or 1 for walking.<br>
I never bothered with aubury because I didnt think he would work. Banking works very well <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Also, the running part was a bit messed up, you could run but it didn’t check whether run was on or off if you were already moving. And it didn’t know if you were running when you logged in.<br>
I did find some of the autospawn stuff… Thanks for the help <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>To set walking position, look in autospawn.cfg.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to get it to work, but no matter how much I use the range things, they will not walk.</p>
