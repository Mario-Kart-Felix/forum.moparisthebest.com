    <description>If I look around, I just see everyone using, no, leeching PI servers. I&#39;ve tried like 5 servers which were on the top list of private servers. All leeches of Project Insanity. I myself tried out Project Insanity, and it was just horrible. I mean, 1. It&#39;s just bugged a lot. 2. That&#39;s just a already made server. What can you possibly change?

What do you think about this?

(If anybody wants to make private server, a good one like those of 3-4 years ago, I&#39;m in.)</description>

<p>Yeah but there’s a difference between using a released download and actual leeching (claiming you made it when infact all you have done is change the name).</p>
<p>People want to be a part of this community so badly that they feel the only way they will be accepted is to have 200 rep. The quickest way for rep is the downloads section so they release something as soon as possible, denying the original owner of any credit, therefore gaining all the respect.</p>
<p>The only thing is it’s a failure everytime because we can spot leechers a mile off.</p>

              <p>Project Insanity attracts such a crowd because of the features that are already included. It doesn’t take much work to get the source running and players into it. The problem has been around since DeltaScape was released. You can practically see that those sources took over, just check the Server Help/Download sections.</p>
<p>As Jagex keeps moving on, so does RSPS. Not much we can do about it, but the old servers will definitely be the most fun.</p>
