    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jar-error-please-help/524579</link>
    <description>Ik i posted about this earlier but this is different problem with a different client, so i made it a jar then ran but its saying 

&quot;error_game_js5connect&quot;

now i believe that is because something with the cache but it runs fine without the jar, it works fine with the .bat file of it idk why its saying error the client also is stuck at checking for updates 1%</description>
