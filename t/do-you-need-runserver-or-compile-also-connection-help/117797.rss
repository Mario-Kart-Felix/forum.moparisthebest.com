    <title>Do you need runserver or compile? also connection help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-you-need-runserver-or-compile-also-connection-help/117797</link>
    <description>Ok i tryed to get my port to go through, i even had good moparscape coders use remote access and try to make my computer work on a no-ip. Ive done everything portforward, and everything, but when i would see if the port 43594 would work on my ip or w/e it thing would say connection timed out? Then also i had someone say that people cannot connect to your server if you use compile.. he said just straight up open runserver and then people can connect? But when i try to open my runserver it opens really fast and then closes. Ive been using the compiler and hit r to runserver but he said no one can connect like that?

-- WTF is going on and happening?</description>
