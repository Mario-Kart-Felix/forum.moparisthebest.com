    <title>New at scripting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-at-scripting/7072</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, I&#39;m new at scripting and I was trying to write a script that will right click in one place, then left click in another, and i was hoping that someone could help me out with some of the errors I have been having. I have looked at other scripts and used various techniques, as well as the manual included with Scar. Here is my current script. Please note that I have limited understanding of most of these things.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[scar]
program New;
var x,y: integer;
const Item = 1000;
Procedure SellItem;
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(700+random(25),359+random(25));
ClickMouse((700+random(25),359+random(25),false);
Sleep(200+random(20));
MoveMouseSmooth(686+random(30),449+random(10));
ClickMouse(686+random(30),449+random(10),true);
Item-10
end;
repeat
seller;
until
Item &lt;= 0
end.
[/scar]&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>DON’T use this on RuneScape <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> (at least not with main character!), as there is detectable command(<em>Cough</em>ClickMouse<em>Cough</em> ;)).</p>
<p>I spaced it for you… So you can easily check where you made mistakes. (Like you never started the ‘main loop’ at the end of script, now there is the begin which was needed.)</p>
<p>If it’s not what you tryed… We could check it out better…</p>
<p>AAAAND here is a little bit(just a little) better version of it (still easily readable):</p>
<p>[scar]program New;</p>
<p>var<br>
item, x, y: integer;</p>
<p>procedure SellItem;<br>
begin<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(700 + random(25), 359 + random(25));<br>
Wait(5+random(10));<br>
GetMousePos(x,y);<br>
HoldMouse(x, y, false);<br>
Wait(15+random(20));<br>
ReleaseMouse(x, y, false);<br>
Wait(200 + random(20));<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(686 + random(30), 449 + random(10));<br>
Wait(5+random(10));<br>
GetMousePos(x, y);<br>
HoldMouse(x, y, true);<br>
Wait(15+random(20));<br>
ReleaseMouse(x, y, true);<br>
Item := Item - 10<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin<br>
ActivateClient;<br>
Wait(1000);<br>
Item:=1000;<br>
repeat<br>
sellItem;<br>
until (Item &lt;= 0);<br>
end.[/scar]</p>
<p>Fixing YOUR script(progress :P):</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">â€¢</span> = Add.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">â€¢</span> = Delete.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">â€¢</span> = Don’t do nothing to these. (These will be ‘fixed’ ;)).<br>

ClickMouse(686+random(30),449+random(10)x,y,true); //Same thing here, than with false click. Wouldn’t click to the position where it moved the mouse to. This time there is not unneeded ( tho.<br>
Item:=Item-10 //Added the needed mark there &amp; Item which was needed, so now it recognizes what it is everytime before there will be -10… :]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">end;</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">begin</span> //Added the begin here (WHICH WAS NEEDED, to start the mainloop.)<br>
ActivateClient; //Good to be here… Activates the TARGETTED client! Remove the line if its unneeded.<br>
Sleep(1000); //A bit wait after activating the client… So it will wait a second and then start ‘selling’.<br>
Item:=1000 //So this is which with you will start the ‘Item’ with. Now its same as in const. (It does the job ;])<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">repeat</span><br>
seller SellItem; //Your procedures name is SellItem, not seller. So fixed.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">until</span><br>
Item &lt;= 0<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">end.</span></p>
<p>Hopefully I helped at all… Lol <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> (took some time to make the ‘progress’ there…)</p>
<p>BTW, in your script there might be a bit too much random with coordinates (where mouse moves to)… Perhaps. I can’t be sure though, if you really meant to have em that random…</p>
<p>Ps. You did a good job with it, as it’s a start for you… There was couple major errors(which happen to almost all of us, when we start(ed) scripting at first), that’s all. Keep em coming…</p>
