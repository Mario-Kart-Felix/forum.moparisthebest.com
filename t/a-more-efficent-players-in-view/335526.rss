Our player is always @ 0,0

Him being able to see 15 x1 15 y1 16 x2 16 y2 as what reines wanted.

So watching players inside zones would be more efficient then watches the entire landscape.


So... lets go into our players view.

This is the default.

[code]
	public List&lt;Player&gt; getPlayersInView() {
		List&lt;Player&gt; players = new ArrayList&lt;Player&gt;();
		ActiveTile[][] viewArea = getViewedArea(15, 15, 16, 16);
		for (int x = 0; x &lt; viewArea.length; x++)
			for (int y = 0; y &lt; viewArea[x].length; y++) {
				ActiveTile t = viewArea[x][y];
				if (t != null) {
					List&lt;Player&gt; temp = t.getPlayers();
					if (temp != null) {
						players.addAll(temp);
					}
				}
			}
		return players;
	}
[/code]

Now lets put them into Sectors or &quot;Zones&quot;

[code]
	public List&lt;Player&gt; getPlayersSectorA() {
		List&lt;Player&gt; players = new ArrayList&lt;Player&gt;();
		ActiveTile[][] viewArea = getViewedArea(15, 0, 0, 16);
		for (int x = 0; x &lt; viewArea.length; x++)
			for (int y = 0; y &lt; viewArea[x].length; y++) {
				ActiveTile t = viewArea[x][y];
				if (t != null) {
					List&lt;Player&gt; temp = t.getPlayers();
					if (temp != null) {
						players.addAll(temp);
					}
				}
			}
		return players;
	}

	public List&lt;Player&gt; getPlayersSectorB() {
		List&lt;Player&gt; players = new ArrayList&lt;Player&gt;();
		ActiveTile[][] viewArea = getViewedArea(0, 0, 16, 16);
		for (int x = 0; x &lt; viewArea.length; x++)
			for (int y = 0; y &lt; viewArea[x].length; y++) {
				ActiveTile t = viewArea[x][y];
				if (t != null) {
					List&lt;Player&gt; temp = t.getPlayers();
					if (temp != null) {
						players.addAll(temp);
					}
				}
			}
		return players;
	}

	public List&lt;Player&gt; getPlayersSectorC() {
		List&lt;Player&gt; players = new ArrayList&lt;Player&gt;();
		ActiveTile[][] viewArea = getViewedArea(0, 15, 16, 0);
		for (int x = 0; x &lt; viewArea.length; x++)
			for (int y = 0; y &lt; viewArea[x].length; y++) {
				ActiveTile t = viewArea[x][y];
				if (t != null) {
					List&lt;Player&gt; temp = t.getPlayers();
					if (temp != null) {
						players.addAll(temp);
					}
				}
			}
		return players;
	}

	public List&lt;Player&gt; getPlayersSectorD() {
		List&lt;Player&gt; players = new ArrayList&lt;Player&gt;();
		ActiveTile[][] viewArea = getViewedArea(15, 15, 0, 0);
		for (int x = 0; x &lt; viewArea.length; x++)
			for (int y = 0; y &lt; viewArea[x].length; y++) {
				ActiveTile t = viewArea[x][y];
				if (t != null) {
					List&lt;Player&gt; temp = t.getPlayers();
					if (temp != null) {
						players.addAll(temp);
					}
				}
			}
		return players;
	}
[/code]

Now that we made our &quot;ZONES&quot; lets make it so that they actually mean something instead of updating every second like RSCDV25 did... Which was really shitty and in efficient.

So lets look @ that code.

[code]
	public void updateViewedPlayers() {
		List&lt;Player&gt; playersInView = viewArea.getPlayersInView();
		for (Player p : playersInView) {
			if (p.getIndex() != getIndex() &amp;&amp; p.loggedIn()) {
				this.informOfPlayer(p);
				p.informOfPlayer(this);
			}
		}
[/code]

This did what reines first implemented just looked all around for every player and didnt look for them as needed to see if they needed to be updated.

If you dont believe me add this code...

[code]

	public void updateViewedPlayers() {
		List&lt;Player&gt; playersInView = viewArea.getPlayersInView();
		for (Player p : playersInView) {
			if (p.getIndex() != getIndex() &amp;&amp; p.loggedIn()) {
				this.informOfPlayer(p);
				p.informOfPlayer(this);
                           System.out.println(p.getUsername() + &quot; is being updated&quot;);
			}
		}

[/code]

It will update about every second. Why waste memory for no reason lets update them every time they walk.

[code]
	public void updateViewedPlayers() {
//Sector A
		List&lt;Player&gt; playersInViewA = viewArea.getPlayersSectorA();
		for (Player p : playersInViewA) {
			if (p.getIndex() != getIndex() &amp;&amp; p.loggedIn() &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - p.getLastMoved() &lt; 1000) {
System.out.println(p.getUsername() + &quot; walked inside + &quot; this.getUsername() + &quot;&#39;s sector A&quot;);
				this.informOfPlayer(p);
				p.informOfPlayer(this);
			}
		}
//Sector B
		List&lt;Player&gt; playersInViewB = viewArea.getPlayersSectorB();
		for (Player p : playersInViewB) {
			if (p.getIndex() != getIndex() &amp;&amp; p.loggedIn() &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - p.getLastMoved() &lt; 1000) {
System.out.println(p.getUsername() + &quot; walked inside + &quot; this.getUsername() + &quot;&#39;s sector B&quot;);
				this.informOfPlayer(p);
				p.informOfPlayer(this);
			}
		}
//Sector C
		List&lt;Player&gt; playersInViewC = viewArea.getPlayersSectorC();
		for (Player p : playersInViewC) {
			if (p.getIndex() != getIndex() &amp;&amp; p.loggedIn() &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - p.getLastMoved() &lt; 1000) {
System.out.println(p.getUsername() + &quot; walked inside + &quot; this.getUsername() + &quot;&#39;s sector C&quot;);
				this.informOfPlayer(p);
				p.informOfPlayer(this);
			}
		}
//Sector D
		List&lt;Player&gt; playersInViewD = viewArea.getPlayersSectorD();
		for (Player p : playersInViewD) {
			if (p.getIndex() != getIndex() &amp;&amp; p.loggedIn() &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - p.getLastMoved() &lt; 1000) {
System.out.println(p.getUsername() + &quot; walked inside + &quot; this.getUsername() + &quot;&#39;s sector D&quot;);
				this.informOfPlayer(p);
				p.informOfPlayer(this);
			}
		}
	}

[/code]

Hope you learned something.

And no this isn&#39;t a fix to handle 500 people in one area this is a start there is alot more to add which i have done.

<p>Now let’s compare the number of boolean comparisons per one iteration here<br>
for each player within 15x16:</p>
<p>Is the subject player the same one we’re updating?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No? Get the next player<br>
Yes?<br>
Is the player logged in?<br>
No? Get the next player<br>
Yes? Call the routine org.rscdaemon.model.Player.informOfPlayer(Player)<br>
–Inside call<br>
Does our entity list already contain this player?<br>
No? return<br>
Yes? is the player currently being removed from our entity list?<br>
No? return<br>
Yes? is the player within our viewing range (they should be, otherwise we wouldn’t be in this call in the first place if they weren’t within 15x16, so is this comparison necessary?)<br>
No? return<br>
Yes? Add the player to our watched players entity list<br>
return to calling routine and grab the next player</p>

<p>Without any benchmark testing, who’s to say, but in my opinion all we would be accomplishing here would most likely not even result in a millisecond gain in execution speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to make the system more efficient, I would suggest an event-driven implementation rather than one ran on a cycle.  What I mean by this, is updating the proper collections as the incoming packets from the clients dictate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player logging in: get this players view area and update it<br>
Player moving: get this players view area and update position to players who already have this entity in view, and all to players who do not.<br>
Player equips item: get this players view area and update worn items</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure you get the idea, however with such a simple system and the low amount of data (~30 bytes) to transfer, you would likely not notice a difference yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One final note - what’s with all of this internal tension between everyone?  This is a development board.  Drama stays out.</p>

Actually what he’s trying to achieve is rather important. Updating all NPCs and Players every loop is a resource hog (especially if you have to walk NPCs). It’s simply not needed.</p>
<p>Say you have 4500 NPCs on your server. And one person. 4500 npcs all over the map are getting updated / moved around. Why? Bigger processing time INSIDE LOOPS exponentially increases your resource uses / overall speed of the system.[/quote]<br>
I’m not saying you’re wrong but I just spawned 5,000 KBD’s and the CPU didn’t move up from 2%. It didn’t change what-so-ever. Plus, how often does that happen? Never unless you’re being a twat messing about. It’s proven to work just fine with the normal amount of NPC’s over the map.</p>
<p><img src="http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/2690/screenshot9u.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Anyway, I’m not saying you’re wrong, and I agree with any optimization wherever possible but saying it’s important isn’t necessarily true…</p>

<p>Sorry, next time someone posts something I will say “Nice <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> keep it up.” even though I don’t agree with it.</p>

<p>It’s not like this will make much difference until someone has a need to have 500+ players in an area.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually RSCD will disconnect clients at around 50-60 players in one area if they leave the area and come back (being summoned or going down stairs and then back up) or around 90-120 if they just walk into the pack. We actually had a ban on having drop parties for months as people would host a drop party, 80-120+ would turn up and everyone would disconnect. When GaWdZ ran RSCEmulation we had a drop party with 30-40 online and if you went downstairs and back up you would disconnect.[/quote]</p>
<p>because of…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		for (Player p : newPlayers) {
			byte[] offsets = DataConversions.getMobPositionOffsets(p
					.getLocation(), playerToUpdate.getLocation());
			packet.addBits(p.getIndex(), 16);
			packet.addBits(offsets[0], 5);
			packet.addBits(offsets[1], 5);
			packet.addBits(p.getSprite(), 4);
			packet.addBits(0, 1);
		}
System.out.println("The packet length is " + packet.Length());
		return packet.toPacket();
	}</code></pre>
<p>When you go into a new area it doesnt care how many bytes it sends or how many people are there.<br>
It simply says fuck it send it all @ once.</p>

<p>The packet sending is every 600ms by the way, and it’s only sent 150 times, with a very very small amount of data in each packet</p>

<p>as you can see, it’s using bits, this is the updatePlayerPosition packet, for all known players in a players view, it won’t add extra data unless the players were leaving view, have moved or their appearance has changed, or it’s a new player coming into view.</p>
<p>did you even look through stuff to see what it does?</p>

</aside>
<p>um I’m achieving less resources being used.</p>
<p>Read my thread.</p>
<p>The regular Player update updates all players for no fucking reason.</p>
<p>This updates a player when they move in each sector.</p>
<p>Resources…</p>
<p>Say there is 150 people in 1 area…</p>
<p>it updates 150 people 150 times each 60 miliseconds for no reason?</p>
<p>so thats’s 22,500 times. which makes you dc…</p>
<p>This will update the player and tell all 149 people they need this player updated.</p>
<p>So that would be 150 vs 22,500?</p>
<p>Anyways goodnight.</p>
