    <title>[RS2++] New server base (In Development)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs2-new-server-base-in-development/341634</link>
    <description>Currently I&#39;m developing a new server base in response to Mopars [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,345848.0.html]Paying for private servers and more[/url] thread.

Server core is coded in C++.
Supports scripting in LUA. All packet&#39;s and a few other things will be handled strictly through scripting.

The server is currently being developed to support 317 but is being developed in such a way that it will be able to switch which client protocol is handled without causing any big problems.

Current Progress:
Handles Login. (So impressive right?!)

More complete information and pictures will come soon.

SVN: https://rs2plusplus.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rs2plusplus
All code on the SVN is subject to change. Alot of it is placeholder until the scripting engine is 100% integrated. It by no means reflects the final product as this is early development code.

Removed embedded image, far too big. Follow the link to see.

<p>I know select is being used incorrectly. Already stated that.<br>
And what do you think luabind uses some magical C++ lua api? no it uses the lua c api.<br>
The speed of the scripting is debatable and if I find that it is slow under load then obviously it would be changed.<br>
I agree the encoder abstraction is poor its temporary.<br>
Sure did isaac isn’t even being used anyway.</p>
<p>This code is extremely young more of a poc for myself than anything. Your arguments are fairly invalid. As I have said it is by no means final code.</p>
