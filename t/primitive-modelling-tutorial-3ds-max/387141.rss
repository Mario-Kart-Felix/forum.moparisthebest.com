    <title>Primitive Modelling Tutorial ! 3ds MAX</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/primitive-modelling-tutorial-3ds-max/387141</link>
    <description>OK, Well I&#39;m  making this tutorial because i see a lot of Meta work and sometimes, we just need move on.... This Tutorial Assumes you have little knowledge of Modeling ( its easier to allow everyone to understand you make one this way)

Contents:

[ol][li]Setting up the Work Space[/li]
[li]Creating you first primitive box[/li]
[li]Begin to Shape it into something more[/li]
[li]Sword is born[/li][/ol]


Part I - Setting up the workspace.

So lets begin!.

first off, your going to want to open up 3ds max. (if you don&#39;t have 3ds max GOOGLE Is your best friend for finding it.). We shall begin by setting up the workspace. The default  workspace is usable, But there are many options to choose from.

If you chose to use the default view port layout then skip this Section.

now lets open up the area to change out view port layout.

to do this you need to go to. View -&gt; View port configuration.

After that you&#39;ll want to hit the tab&#39;s within there to go to layout.
[IMG]http://i56.tinypic.com/2n9l5cm.png[/img]

From there your going to want to chose the layout you prefer, In my case i use the trio setup. With this you can also customize it a bit more, When you chose the style you like, you can then change the way each view port faces by simply clicking on them once.
[IMG]http://i56.tinypic.com/6jikww.png[/img]

now that you have that setup, click apply, OK and we can begin.( Short side note: view port not big enough to see everything, Toggle in and out of each port view by pressing Alt - W)

Part II - creating a primitive box.

lets begin by creating the Primitive box! Since this section isn&#39;t very big ill also cover a lot of key&#39;s buttons and where to find them.

once you&#39;re in the view-port you wish to work in, I use Perspective you&#39;ll want to begin by going to the right of your screen  and finding the object type panel.
[IMG]http://i55.tinypic.com/200305t.png[/img]

now that you&#39;ve clicked on &#39;Box&#39; your wanna go into your view port and click and move to get the base of the box, Then raise it by moving the mouse again.
[IMG]http://i54.tinypic.com/2le4b2o.png[/img]

but its see through!? yes i know! lets begin by fixing that. to fix it you will want to hit f3 which will bring it out into a solid box.. But now the boxes outline is missing! You&#39;re going to wanna hit f4 which will bring the wire-frame back out into the model. But that&#39;s not all Lets take it 1 step further! go ahead and hit &#39;7&#39; Which will bring up your poly count and bingo you can now check your poly limit.

this is what you should have so far!
[IMG]http://i56.tinypic.com/2mx06f6.png[/img]

I&#39;d like to point out that small box, With the really mini house on the Right hand corner, you can use the house to reset the view in your view-port (only works for Perspective and Orth view). you can also press through the faces on the box to change views, or click and drags for your own custom movement.

clicking in your scroll wheel and moving your mouse allows your to pan through your view-port, while scrolling your wheel will zoom in and out of it.

Spend some time with all these things before you go further so it allows you to get a feel for the way 3ds max works

Part III: Begin to Shape it into something more

Ok the first thing we need to do is change our Model into an Editable Poly. to do this we can either go &#39;Right click&#39; -&gt; convert to -&gt; Editable poly. Or you can go to the modify tab, and right click your model -&gt; editable poly.
[IMG]http://i55.tinypic.com/ilvhgk.png[/img]

now that you have your box in a editable state lets re size it so we can start on the hilt. to achieve this we need to go to the use the Re size and uniform tool, to get that you can either press &#39;r&#39; to shortcut to it, Or you can go to the top panel and press the button to select it.
[IMG]http://i53.tinypic.com/rm69nm.png[/img]

your going to want to re size it so that its around the size of your handle.  now lets begin to create our Handle!.

lets begin by Extruding and kinda making a bumpy handle if you wish. to be able to do this while you have your model selected your going to want to press &#39;4&#39; if your in the modify tab. or you can go into your modify tab scroll down until you find the selection panel and press on the red box. once you have the selected go ahead and select the top face of your model. now back in the modify panel your going to want to go down and find the edit polygons section where you can then chose to Extrude, i recommend pressing the small box next to the Extrude option as it allows your to set a size you which to extract every time you press it.
[IMG]http://i55.tinypic.com/29z64np.png[/img]

now that you have it Extruded you&#39;ll noticed your model has grew, go ahead now if you wish to keep a squared handle then just Adjust the handle to make it to the size you want, to do this use the select and move tool which can be located 2 buttons to the left of the re size button, or by hitting &#39;W&#39;, now that we have a handle lets go ahead and Create some form of a hilt. 

This is what i have so far.
[IMG]http://i52.tinypic.com/durra.png[/img]

in this tutorial we wont make anything extreme so I&#39;ve gone ahead and just selected to Side&#39;s of the handle at the top like this : 
[IMG]http://i52.tinypic.com/55idzn.png[/img]
now that you&#39;ve selected the 2 sides go ahead and extrude them a bit, after you have done that use the re size tool to make them a bit smaller, where going to make some horns. also use the Rotate tool by pressing &#39;e&#39; or selecting it next to the Re-size button, to rotate your models faces. and keep repeating to you have some form of horns

this is what i have so far:
[IMG]http://i53.tinypic.com/286ty4i.png[/img]

now we have the top part of our hilt done lets do the bottom, in this tutorial where just gonna make it bulge out select the face at the bottom of your model and Extrude it out, then use the re size tool to Make it larger then the handle, Repeat this again but use the Re size tool to bring it back in again, like this:
[IMG]http://i54.tinypic.com/am2l45.png[/img]

(side note: if you plan to use &#39;Extrude&#39; or any of the other options in the panel can be done by pressing the semi-colon button &#39;;&#39; it repeats the last action done.

now lets begin to make the blade, go ahead and select the top face of the model hit the &#39;inset&#39; button next to the Extrude button which allows you to make a new face within the face. once you&#39;ve done that, Press &#39;1&#39; to select vertex&#39;s and realign the lines to make the base of the blade, like this:
[IMG]http://i52.tinypic.com/2o29w.png[/img]

go ahead and  extrude that up to make a blade, Then re size it to make the blade become towards a point, But dont do it all the way, re size it to about 1/2 the size of the blade and then extrude again and then make the tip of the blade like so:
[IMG]http://i56.tinypic.com/2ypl0lv.png[/img]

And there we have it, Your first sword in 3ds max. I&#39;ve only used to basic&#39;s in this tutorial there is a lot more options in this program you can use, And i may cover them in a later tutorial. this sword have been done a lot better but i know you will all do better, and i rushed it as I&#39;ve spent ages on this tutorial on and off a few hours at max, Anyway enjoy

finished sword:

4 = 1<br>
5. Okay there’s another<br>
6. Okay there’s 3.</p>
<p>For a free program meta isn’t bad AT ALL. Sorry for taking so long to post, was in the hospital and stuff. I have no need for a more sophisticated program than meta. And if I do, I just import it into 3DS Max and do my work there for a bit. Meta is too user friendly for me. As a standalone, yes it sucks pretty bad. I do my UV Mapping in 3DS Max and my rendering in a environment.</p>

              <p>OK, Well I’m  making this tutorial because i see a lot of Meta work and sometimes, we just need move on… This Tutorial Assumes you have little knowledge of Modeling ( its easier to allow everyone to understand you make one this way)</p>
<p>Contents:</p>
<p>[ol][li]Setting up the Work Space[/li]<br>
[li]Creating you first primitive box[/li]<br>
[li]Begin to Shape it into something more[/li]<br>
[li]Sword is born[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>Part I - Setting up the workspace.</p>
<p>So lets begin!.</p>
<p>first off, your going to want to open up 3ds max. (if you don’t have 3ds max GOOGLE Is your best friend for finding it.). We shall begin by setting up the workspace. The default  workspace is usable, But there are many options to choose from.</p>
<p>If you chose to use the default view port layout then skip this Section.</p>
<p>now lets open up the area to change out view port layout.</p>
<p>to do this you need to go to. View -&gt; View port configuration.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i52.tinypic.com/25gzb15.png" title="25gzb15.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i52.tinypic.com/25gzb15.png" alt width="258" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">25gzb15.png</span><span class="informations">316×611</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>After that you’ll want to hit the tab’s within there to go to layout.<br>
<img src="http://i56.tinypic.com/2n9l5cm.png" alt width="583" height="53"></p>
<p>From there your going to want to chose the layout you prefer, In my case i use the trio setup. With this you can also customize it a bit more, When you chose the style you like, you can then change the way each view port faces by simply clicking on them once.<br>
<img src="http://i56.tinypic.com/6jikww.png" alt width="140" height="120"></p>
<p>now that you have that setup, click apply, OK and we can begin.( Short side note: view port not big enough to see everything, Toggle in and out of each port view by pressing Alt - W)</p>
<p>Part II - creating a primitive box.</p>
<p>lets begin by creating the Primitive box! Since this section isn’t very big ill also cover a lot of key’s buttons and where to find them.</p>
<p>once you’re in the view-port you wish to work in, I use Perspective you’ll want to begin by going to the right of your screen  and finding the object type panel.<br>
<img src="http://i55.tinypic.com/200305t.png" alt width="178" height="212"></p>
<p>now that you’ve clicked on ‘Box’ your wanna go into your view port and click and move to get the base of the box, Then raise it by moving the mouse again.<br>
<img src="http://i54.tinypic.com/2le4b2o.png" alt width="365" height="236"></p>
<p>but its see through!? yes i know! lets begin by fixing that. to fix it you will want to hit f3 which will bring it out into a solid box… But now the boxes outline is missing! You’re going to wanna hit f4 which will bring the wire-frame back out into the model. But that’s not all Lets take it 1 step further! go ahead and hit ‘7’ Which will bring up your poly count and bingo you can now check your poly limit.</p>
<p>this is what you should have so far!<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i56.tinypic.com/2mx06f6.png" title="2mx06f6.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i56.tinypic.com/2mx06f6.png" alt width="690" height="190"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">2mx06f6.png</span><span class="informations">1420×393</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>I’d like to point out that small box, With the really mini house on the Right hand corner, you can use the house to reset the view in your view-port (only works for Perspective and Orth view). you can also press through the faces on the box to change views, or click and drags for your own custom movement.</p>
<p>clicking in your scroll wheel and moving your mouse allows your to pan through your view-port, while scrolling your wheel will zoom in and out of it.</p>
<p>Spend some time with all these things before you go further so it allows you to get a feel for the way 3ds max works</p>
<p>Part III: Begin to Shape it into something more</p>
<p>Ok the first thing we need to do is change our Model into an Editable Poly. to do this we can either go ‘Right click’ -&gt; convert to -&gt; Editable poly. Or you can go to the modify tab, and right click your model -&gt; editable poly.<br>
<img src="http://i55.tinypic.com/ilvhgk.png" alt width="183" height="476"></p>
<p>now that you have your box in a editable state lets re size it so we can start on the hilt. to achieve this we need to go to the use the Re size and uniform tool, to get that you can either press ‘r’ to shortcut to it, Or you can go to the top panel and press the button to select it.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i53.tinypic.com/rm69nm.png" title="rm69nm.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i53.tinypic.com/rm69nm.png" alt width="690" height="24"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">rm69nm.png</span><span class="informations">1236×43</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>your going to want to re size it so that its around the size of your handle.  now lets begin to create our Handle!.</p>
<p>lets begin by Extruding and kinda making a bumpy handle if you wish. to be able to do this while you have your model selected your going to want to press ‘4’ if your in the modify tab. or you can go into your modify tab scroll down until you find the selection panel and press on the red box. once you have the selected go ahead and select the top face of your model. now back in the modify panel your going to want to go down and find the edit polygons section where you can then chose to Extrude, i recommend pressing the small box next to the Extrude option as it allows your to set a size you which to extract every time you press it.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i55.tinypic.com/29z64np.png" title="29z64np.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i55.tinypic.com/29z64np.png" alt width="179" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">29z64np.png</span><span class="informations">179×724</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>now that you have it Extruded you’ll noticed your model has grew, go ahead now if you wish to keep a squared handle then just Adjust the handle to make it to the size you want, to do this use the select and move tool which can be located 2 buttons to the left of the re size button, or by hitting ‘W’, now that we have a handle lets go ahead and Create some form of a hilt.</p>
<p>This is what i have so far.<br>
<img src="http://i52.tinypic.com/durra.png" alt width="140" height="120"></p>
<p>in this tutorial we wont make anything extreme so I’ve gone ahead and just selected to Side’s of the handle at the top like this :<br>
<img src="http://i52.tinypic.com/55idzn.png" alt width="140" height="120"><br>
now that you’ve selected the 2 sides go ahead and extrude them a bit, after you have done that use the re size tool to make them a bit smaller, where going to make some horns. also use the Rotate tool by pressing ‘e’ or selecting it next to the Re-size button, to rotate your models faces. and keep repeating to you have some form of horns</p>
<p>this is what i have so far:<br>
<img src="http://i53.tinypic.com/286ty4i.png" alt width="618" height="321"></p>
<p>now we have the top part of our hilt done lets do the bottom, in this tutorial where just gonna make it bulge out select the face at the bottom of your model and Extrude it out, then use the re size tool to Make it larger then the handle, Repeat this again but use the Re size tool to bring it back in again, like this:<br>
<img src="http://i54.tinypic.com/am2l45.png" alt width="140" height="120"></p>
<p>(side note: if you plan to use ‘Extrude’ or any of the other options in the panel can be done by pressing the semi-colon button ‘;’ it repeats the last action done.</p>
<p>now lets begin to make the blade, go ahead and select the top face of the model hit the ‘inset’ button next to the Extrude button which allows you to make a new face within the face. once you’ve done that, Press ‘1’ to select vertex’s and realign the lines to make the base of the blade, like this:<br>
<img src="http://i52.tinypic.com/2o29w.png" alt width="470" height="291"></p>
<p>go ahead and  extrude that up to make a blade, Then re size it to make the blade become towards a point, But dont do it all the way, re size it to about 1/2 the size of the blade and then extrude again and then make the tip of the blade like so:<br>
<img src="http://i56.tinypic.com/2ypl0lv.png" alt width="140" height="120"></p>
<p>And there we have it, Your first sword in 3ds max. I’ve only used to basic’s in this tutorial there is a lot more options in this program you can use, And i may cover them in a later tutorial. this sword have been done a lot better but i know you will all do better, and i rushed it as I’ve spent ages on this tutorial on and off a few hours at max, Anyway enjoy</p>
<p>finished sword:<br>

<p>thanks for reading, Strangle.</p>
