    <title>A New Private Server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-new-private-server/228076</link>
    <description>Hey Mopar Community,

I recently agreed to create a server with someone, but i feel he doesn&#39;t want it as much as i do, so i have created this thread to find someone who will team up with me and make a GOOD server.

I don&#39;t like anything like Czar, or traditional pk server Etc. I like original things. No portals everywhere and npcs shouting &quot;OMG OWNER IS ONLINE&quot;. I don&#39;t like any of that. 
I was thinking we could probably use Richscape V2, a Dodian 6 base.

If you would like to team up with me please post with the form i applied to the bottom of the thread. I would love it if you were up for purchasing a domain for the server. I can install SMF probably, since we can&#39;t get Vbulletin because it is alot of money, but if you can purchase a domain i can install forums and Create a Webclient too.

So basically, all i want is someone who will not drive off this idea in a few weeks. I want someone who is dedicated to the server and at least knows some things.

[code=javascript]
Name:
MSN Address:
Experience in programming:
Able to purchase a domain:
Web Design Experience (NOT NEEDED):
Extra Information:
[/code]

I look forward to your &quot;Applications&quot;.

Thank you all.</description>
