    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-project-serversoft-recruiting-508/364821</link>
    <description>Hello, this is the project of the [b]ServerSoft Development Team[/b]. Although our Development Team is [b][u]Not[/b] in place of advertisement on this website, it is still rapidly growing 

fast.


Some features on of our Base:


[ul][li]A Mapdata Class Base which makes it more unlikley for you to glitch in a Missing Mapdata region.[/li]
[li]Anti SYI, and Anti Flooding. If we had a Vps, the Server would be Vitally impossible to crash with a Server Crasher.[/li]
[li]Excellent Skilling Base, for each unique skill. Some skills are still under development, though.[/li]
[li]100% Realistic Construction like real RuneScape. All rooms buildable, objects buildable, etc.[/li]
[li]100% Anti-Lag (Only chance of you getting lag may be the cause of your own computer).[/li]
[li]A backup Saving System, which automatically saves 3 backup character-types.[/li]
[li]A new Grand Exchange, Absolutley NO ERRORS, and excacly like REAL RUNESCAPE.[/li][/ul]



And much, more!


We have been with ServerSoft for 3 years, however during those first 2 years, we were in 317. But during our past failures, we have learned from our mistakes, and decided to put our skills to 
our max. We have more features, but for some, we cannot take pictures of, but instead you must view the contents for yourself. 


Here are some pictures of our Server Developments:

Grand Exchange:

Construction:

[img]http://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/14/71/90/64/aaa10.png[/img]

Those were the only available pictures that we had in our database. Those pictures were taken of our Source, however the persons, or should I say PERSON who took them is no longer apart of 
development team, with one last request of his/her name being concealed. 


Application Form:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Age:

About you?
Something to proove your experience or knowledge, and why you should be apart of this team.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Either post, or PM. Thank-you, and we will notify you as soon as possible. THANK YOU.</description>

<p>So you just assume that just because some server has some features that I do, that I just automatically followed their tutorial? Yes, you are an idiot. And, if you to see the inside of the code, it would look nothing like ours. You don’t even know the features my Construction has to offer.</p>

<p>There are no tutorials for the Consutrction skill unless you download Bulby’s 508, and completley leech off it. And even if you do that, it still won’t look like the one in the picture. And plus, the only actual servers with this, are 317, and is would be extremley difficult to leech a code like that. Grand Exchange I will admit, you do see on alot of servers, but all of ServerSoft’s work on created <span class="bbcode-b">Entirley</span> by those who are in association with ServerSoft. If not, credits will be posted for that person.</p>
