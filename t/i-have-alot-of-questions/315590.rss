    <title>I have alot of questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-alot-of-questions/315590</link>
    <description>  ok, so earlier i only played a dif server,
 and iwas friends with the owner and i looked stuff up over here so i cud help some times,
       anyways, the server closed...R.I.P.
  and now i&#39;m gonna probably make my own server with some friends,
i&#39;m gonna be the hoster and coder, so i need a little help,

1.once i have no-ip., i picked what i&#39;ll base my servre off of, now how do i make it so that when i log into my ip, it goesinto the server i want? i mean, where do i code in thefiles, what ip i&#39;m using,    idk if i asked it right, but if u understandthnpls reply.

2.is it possible to add another rank? i meani asked this beffore but didnt really get an answer. becuase right now there is 0-3, player,mod,admin,owner.
        and i wanted to make it so there is : player,donater,mod,admin,owner.  just so donaers could get crowns, or maybe just make therank for close friends.

3.how do i make a donation thing? lol. i mean,i have a paypal acc, now what? i post the info on my forums, and then how do i know who donated? how do i make sure that the real donater gets the rank?

4.what do u guys recomend? should i host a 317 or 508, people always tell me that 508s suck, their bugged, they lagg. i personnally wanted to host a 508, but i heard that 317s are easierto code n&#39; all.


i have more questions that i will ask/post later on, and thank you for our cooperation  :)</description>

              <p>im not answering on all but one number 4.</p>
<p>317 is definetly the best to code and host becuz its less laggy and more stabile than a 508 witch has alot off glitches and lags and are more unstabile</p>
