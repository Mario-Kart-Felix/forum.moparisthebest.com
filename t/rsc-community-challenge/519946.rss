    <title>RSC Community Challenge?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsc-community-challenge/519946</link>
    <description>So the community challenges in the general programming section get popular from time to time and I notice a few people around the board are attempting to create their own servers and interested in learning Java. This is up for discussion but maybe we can have a weekly community challenge. All entries must be turned in by Sunday standard time and a new challenge gets posted every Monday? Challenges can range from custom items to code efficiency.
