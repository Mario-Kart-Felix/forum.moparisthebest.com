    <description>Welcome To Sour&#39;s Help Thread.

I&#39;m SourSoul, Welcome To My Help Thread. Earlier This Year There Was A Mass Deletion By Mod Taharok. During Looking Through The Forum, I&#39;ve Seen Stupid, Idiotic Short Questions In Threads That Could Cause Another Mass Deletion. I&#39;ve Been Wondering What I Could Do To Help The Forum To Avoid Another Mass Deletion. I Came Up With A Thread That Can Help You With All Your Questions On Private Servers. I&#39;m Giving You A 90% Chance That I Can Answer Your Questions.

If You Are UnLucky And That 10% Has Been Giving To You, You Might Be In Luck. I&#39;m Lucking For Some More Helpers To Help Me With This Thread.
