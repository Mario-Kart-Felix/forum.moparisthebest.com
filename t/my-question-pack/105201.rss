    <title>My question pack :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-question-pack/105201</link>
    <description>1: How do I make it so that an animation goes the right way if I attack a person?

E.g. I use a bow. A glowing arrow shoots out, but it always point south. So when I shoot somebody that&#39;s north of me, the arrow goes backwards. How do I make it so that the arrow always goes towards the person?

2: How do I make it when I attack somebody, the GFX appears on my character?

E.g. I have special attacks. I use Dragon Longsword and I use it&#39;s special. The animation appears on the other character at a wierd angle. The animation doesn&#39;t appear on my Dragon Longsword; it appears on the other character. How can I solve it? Picture -

3: OK, I&#39;ve been to really good servers like ZdiddyScape and Trail To Hell2. Whenever I mass click on a training object on their server, it doesn&#39;t lag, meaning that while mass clicking, I click on somewhere else and in an instant my character goes there. When I mass click on a training object in my server, it lags. I try to click somewhere else and my character won&#39;t move for a long time. And when I click on an NPC once, to attack it, I click on the food and there&#39;s like a few second delay in eating it. Same with trying to move somewhere else when I want to run from an NPC. Does anybody have a code to make it anti-lag, just like those servers that I tried out?

4: Guys, I tried changing the required levels for items... I made a new character to test train on my server. I have like 38 attack and I can equip a D Hally what the fuck? And When I try to equip a D2h, it says I need 60 defence? Please, someone help!</description>

              <p>okay, some private servers have that. (for number 4) try and look around in that part. then go down to where it says defence (or just CTRL + F then type in dragon, then continue until you find Dragon halberd or something like that, then change that [under defence] to 0 or whatever you want it to be) if that doesn’t work i have no clue. For number 1 i don’t really know, but if the gfx doesn’t look like it works, then go to where ever you have the special part (or you combat part where it says like: <code>} else if (p.equipment[3] == 11698 &amp;&amp; p.specialAmount &gt;= 75) { // Saradomin godsword.
                        hitDamage = Misc.random(
                                (int) (maxMeleeHit(p) * 1.13));
                        p.usingSpecial = false;
                        p.specialAmount -= 75;
                        p.requestAnim(7071, 0);
                        p.requestGFX(1220, 0);</code><br>
make sure it says<code>p.requestGFX(GFXID, 0);</code></p>
<p>That’s all i really know, but i want to know how to add in a custom special…</p>

<p>Sorry mate… But if you want that kind of speed you’ll need to learn how to code your server properly to make it anti-lag or no lagg at all.</p>

<p>I did your answer to 1, 2 and 4. I did that tutorial. When I click on something, the arrow only appears once. stilgfx doesn’t see to work when I use the special. I did number 4, but it says I need 60 def when I edited it in the int attack one.</p>
