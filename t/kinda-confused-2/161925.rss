    <description>Okay, i&#39;m having a bit of trouble..  

[code]
public void playerGfx(int id, int delay) {
mask100var1 = id;
mask100var2 = delay;
mask100update = true;
updateRequired = true;
}
[/code]

Now, i&#39;m trying to move on from that, making it so, i can use like int id, int delay, int X, int Y, int height, int time... I&#39;ve got this...

[code]
public void playerGfx9(int id, int delay, int Y, int X, int height, int time) {
mask100var1 = id;
mask100var2 = delay;
mask100update = true;
updateRequired = true;
outStream.createFrame(85);
outStream.writeByteC(Y - (mapRegionY * 8));
outStream.writeByteC(X - (mapRegionX * 8));
outStream.createFrame(4);
outStream.writeByte(0);//Tiles away (X &gt;&gt; 4 + Y &amp; 7)
outStream.writeByte(height);//height of the spell above it&#39;s basic place, i think it&#39;s written in pixels 100 pixels higher
outStream.writeWord(time);//Time before casting the graphic
}
[/code]

All that i&#39;ve done is took some things from create projectile n stuff like that. And added it into the method playerGfx..

I&#39;m trying to make it so, this (facing gfx) has height, and i can control whether its on myself, or enemyX, enemyY..

Okay my question.. When i use this, why does it lag me out?.. Just disconnects me, and i get this in client..
Error: T2 - 4,85,71 - 6,3232,9312 - 0,100,0,0,-18,29,
Error: T2 - 4,85,71 - 6,2993,3616 - 0,100,0,0,-88,9,

Zilchuary, or how every you spell it, told me that my server couldn&#39;t handle the GFX models of the client.

^^ Noticing the facing GFX 252. Using method... 
[code]
public void playerGfx(int id, int delay) {
mask100var1 = id;
mask100var2 = delay;
mask100update = true;
updateRequired = true;
}
[/code]

So that works no problems..

So it&#39;s got to be something to do with this part of the code..

[code]
outStream.writeByteC(Y - (mapRegionY * 8));
outStream.writeByteC(X - (mapRegionX * 8));
outStream.createFrame(4);
outStream.writeByte(0);//Tiles away (X &gt;&gt; 4 + Y &amp; 7)
outStream.writeByte(height);//height of the spell above it&#39;s basic place, i think it&#39;s written in pixels 100 pixels higher
outStream.writeWord(time);//Time before casting the graphic
[/code]

I&#39;m not really sure what part it is, if someone could point it out, would be great :D.. OOOO i missed something out.. It had this in it...
[code]
outStream.writeWord(id);
[/code]

That worked, didn&#39;t log me out or anything, but the gfx wasn&#39;t facing.. It had 1 facing gfx, which was at the set height. And the outStream.writeWord(id); was always facing south, but the height worked. So i took it out, and i keep getting disconnected every time i try to spec someone.

Could someone please help? Many thanks..</description>
