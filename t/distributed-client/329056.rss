              <p>well, before sending it to him i suggest archiving it in either .zip or .rar format. Which I still dont know how someone could get a blank folder… anywho. Secondly, you need to change 0.0.0.0 to the ip adress that the server is running from. The ip 0.0.0.0 its localhosting (i think? i’ve always used 127.0.0.1 for localhosting.) like i said, just change the ip in the distributable client to the ip adress of the computer running the server, and all should work out great.</p>
