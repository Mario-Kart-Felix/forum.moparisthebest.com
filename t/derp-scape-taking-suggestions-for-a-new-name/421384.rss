Forums: Still in progress I will add them soon.[/font]

[center]Project:
I recently just started coding PI&#39;s about 2 months ago which was around the time I started coding again in general. I didn&#39;t think I would actually wanna release a server but as I worked on it I really felt that I could possibly make and release a good enough server for people to play on. I hope to get players when I do release but if I don&#39;t then I don&#39;t what can I do about it? I am still learning alot about coding PI base servers and I don&#39;t plan to have a release real soon but I do plan to have a release. So I hope that you guys can give me some ideas and help me out along the way and wish me luck!(: Thanks guys!


Server Information:
-Economy Is getting cleaned up to perfect
-Donator Island is very unique and has lots to do
-There are certain areas for donors only
-Very good pking with working SOL and things like that
-Working curses
-Has pk shops and slayer point shop
-Almost all skills are 100% Herblore, Farming and Firemaking are the only three that I know aren&#39;t
-Npc&#39;s drop items such as: Godswords, Bandos armor, Arma armor etc...
-There is also Summoning and Hunter, Summoning needs some work but nothing much
-Working teletabs
-Frost Dragons with good drops
-Full brimhaven and taverly dungeons
-Perfect teleport GFX
-Custom skill ( Pking ) Thanks to InsidiaX
-Really nice skilling spot but it may be changed I don&#39;t know yet


Note:
I will be adding more to this thread don&#39;t worry(:
I am taking name suggestions for server(:
The server has some bugs that need worked out
If anyone wants to be a developer just PM me and tell me what you can do to help(:
Interfaces are really basic most servers have them from what Ive seen
I will add more things to this thread soon, I just wanted to get the thread started
Pictures will be added soon too so don&#39;t worry or freak out about pictures lol
Like I said a few times I AM AND WILL TAKE ANY IDEAS YOU HAVE(:
Well that&#39;s all for now but I will add more to this thread soon! Thanks Everyone!
