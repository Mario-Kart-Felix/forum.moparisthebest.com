<p>Hmm, only use the extra 0 if your source is programmed for that, if its not then you either only need a 0 for a 5 digit ID or you don’t need 0 at all.</p>
<p>To change the “greeting” just search whatever it currently is in client.java.<br>
It would be something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sendMessage("Your current greeting here");</code></pre>
<p>Change ONLY whats inside the quotations.</p>

              <p>ok, to change your message open your client.java and search for “Welcome to…” and then to do the command search for “pickup” and if its there check the end of the code to see if it has “&amp;&amp; playerRites …” remove that and now every one can spawn items.</p>
