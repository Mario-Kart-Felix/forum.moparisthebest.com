    <title>Set Default Program/Open With... Does not work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/set-default-program-open-with-does-not-work/416880</link>
    <description>After a fuckton of googling, searching, and tweaking, Windows still will not allow me to change the default program for ANY file type.  I try to make uTorrent my main .torrent application, press OK, close, and it&#39;s still fucking set as Opera.  I try to set Windows Preview or w.e to default for opening pictures, but it opens Photoshop every time.  I try to make VLC my default video player, but it opens WMP every time.

Out of all my computers, this is the only one that does it.  I never had this problem before, and I don&#39;t recall performing any actions that could even be close to making windows do this.  Haven&#39;t changed any settings at all, but it worked before.</description>

<p>HcoJustin forgot the Applications folder, but it’s still a fucking pain doing this for every damn application.</p>
