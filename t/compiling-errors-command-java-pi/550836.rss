    <title>Compiling errors - command.java [pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compiling-errors-command-java-pi/550836</link>
    <description>Okay guys i have coded on lots or pi bases before but normally just by following guides and not really understanding the codes i was writing/editing. Now i am on a project using hybrid pvp source and client trying to clean it out and rewrite a lot of coding (expecially the skills) and that way i will have a better understanding of these codes and how they work.

That out of the way what i am working on now is because there was a lot of commands that i found useless or unwanted i started deleting some and i ended up with tons of compiling errors (i probably deleted a bracket or something i shouldnt have) so then i desided i wanted to completely clear the commands and rewrite the way i wanted so that it was organised with no unwanted codes/ commands.

I deleted everything except for the little top part and compiled with no issue.
[code]package server.model.players.packets;

import server.Config;
import server.Connection;
import server.Server;
import server.model.players.Client;
import server.model.players.PacketType;
import server.model.players.PlayerHandler;
import server.util.Misc;
import server.world.WorldMap;[/code]


Then i started trying to write simple command codes and compile (::master, ::pure, ::items, ::home) and i keep getting errors even when i think that it seems perfect :/ 

here is an example of trying to start with pure as my first code
[code]package server.model.players.packets;

import server.Config;
import server.Connection;
import server.Server;
import server.model.players.Client;
import server.model.players.PacketType;
import server.model.players.PlayerHandler;
import server.util.Misc;
import server.world.WorldMap;




if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;pure&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 0) {
                        c.getPA().addSkillXP(14000000, 0);
                        c.getPA().addSkillXP(0, 1);
                        c.getPA().addSkillXP(14000000, 2);
                        c.getPA().addSkillXP(14000000, 3);
                        c.getPA().addSkillXP(14000000, 4);
                        c.getPA().addSkillXP(136594, 5);
                        c.getPA().addSkillXP(14000000, 6);
                }[/code]

error

8 errors
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]

I didnt just try one thing and give up either.
I tried adding a } bracket before the pure code
Itried adding a } before and after the code
tried { before and } after the code and switched them
Also tried doing ::home,::pickup,::master, and multiple arragements of brackets just like i tried with pure and i couldnt figure it out  :palm:  :confused:

I think if i get help to figure out how to get one command code compiling and working then i can use that to figure out what i was doing wrong with all of the rest.

Any help would be highly appreciated.
Thanks!</description>

"  symbol:   variable playerCommand"</p>
<p>If you look in your Commands.java, no where did you declare the variable “playerCommand”.</p>
<p>Create a <span class="bbcode-b">String</span> variable named “playerCommand” within the method “processPacket”.</p>
<p>That will solve the compiler error.</p>
<p>You then need to make it so the playerCommand string is the value of whatever the player had typed into the command, so you want to set it to:</p>
<p><code>
playerCommand = c.getInStream().readString();</code></p>
<p>because the inStream is the InputStream that is being read from the client, and you’re reading the <span class="bbcode-u">String</span> the player sent.</p>
<p>If some of these terms don’t make sense, or if what I said doesn’t make sense to you, it’s because you lack knowledge of the Java language. And, as I said before, you should look at the tutorials on Oracles website.</p>

I recommend you read the tutorials on their website, and fool around with some example code (They also provide plenty of that) as you do them, so you can gain a deeper understanding.</p>

tried { before and } after the code and switched them<br>
Also tried doing ::home,::pickup,::master, and multiple arragements of brackets just like i tried with pure and i couldnt figure it out  :palm:  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>I think if i get help to figure out how to get one command code compiling and working then i can use that to figure out what i was doing wrong with all of the rest.</p>
<p>Any help would be highly appreciated.<br>
Thanks!</p>
