[anchor=intro][b][size=20pt]Introduction[/size][/b][/anchor]
Yes, yes, yes, I know. Spleen15 making another lame project topic that&#39;s just going to fail and die out after one day, right? WRONG! I have more motivation with me now than ever before, so I am going to carry this bad boy out. Let me tell you that RuneAmp is not going to be your average server, if it was, I wouldn&#39;t waste my time posting this. But I am going to be a pioneer, the first of my class, I may start a whole private server revolution, who knows. The idea for RuneAmp was born one day when I thought to myself: [i]Why is it that every single private server is based on combat and PKing? Why can&#39;t people who like to skill just craft and smith happily without worrying about their attack or strength level? [/i] I couldn&#39;t think of a good answer for this, so I took it into my own hands and decided to change it. I wasn&#39;t sure it was worth my while though, so I took my idea to the streets. I asked the community if I should spend my time making a RuneScape look-alike, or if I should make a skiller&#39;s haven, somewhere where combat wasn&#39;t an issue, hell, combat wasn&#39;t even included in the programming. The responses were overwhelming and almost unanimous. The people also wanted change. So here I am now, putting my life on hold for 2+ months to try and be the first to present a 100% combat free server.

              <p>You would need some real Java skills to do this. And if you want anything good you would need to start a server from scratch, like I’m doing. And if you want website interaction, MySQL would probably be the easiest way for that. Also, you would need to write a basic LoginServer if you wanted more then one World. It needs to keep track of all the players online and make sure no one is on more then one World. Heres an example:<br>
<a href="http://allgofree.redirectme.net/rs/worldselect/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://allgofree.redirectme.net/rs/worldselect/</a></p>
<p>Start learning Java IO with ByteStreams <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
And don’t forget the buffer. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>No offense, but I’m laughing to a point that it’s pretty painful right now. You have enough inspiration for this? I’ll give a liberal estimate: you’ll get about 25% through and give up, realizing it’s all futile anyway because the revolution you envision is simply too much work and you are too unlearned for it. Seriously. There’s no way you’ll write your own cache (which, by the way, would either involve creating a complex format or learning the existing one), learn enough to interact with SQL through an applet, and create a good network IO library. It’s far too much work, and would require a large team or skilled, unemployed developer, not a single scrawny brat with a bit of gumption and too much imagination. If you don’t believe me, prove me wrong. I guarantee you won’t.</p>

</aside>
<p>I never said I was writing my own cache.</p>
<p>And I never said I was going to start a revolution. I said I could. About half of the people here are bandwagoners, they just jump on the next best thing. PK Isle came out and everyone went from _____Scape to ______ Isle. Silab released some items now every other post pertains to it. I’m just saying it’s a possibility.</p>
