              <p>Age: 15<br>
Location: Australia<br>
Do you have experiences with being a staff member?<br>
Yes, I have been Administrator on some popular minecraft servers, I also am a moderator on two Dark RP Garry’s Mod servers.<br>
What would you do in a situation where one person may be lying and one person may not be?<br>
I would write down their point of view of what happened then If people where around I would write down their side of the story, then I would believe the person with the most amount of evidence. If no one was around I would give them both a warning.<br>
Would you say you are good with people?<br>
I’m a friendly guy who loves getting involved with events and helping people out, so yes I would say i’m good with people.<br>
Admin or mod?<br>
I don’t mind, whatever you deem I should get.<br>
Would you say you are dedicated?<br>
Yes, I’m extremely dedicated to being staff.<br>
How will you commit to this project?<br>
I will commit my assistance with the community when the server get’s released.</p>
