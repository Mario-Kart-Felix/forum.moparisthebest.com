    <title>Can NEVER connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-never-connect/54199</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been able to play MoparScape exactly 3 times. I have been able to play on other people&#39;s servers like twice. Every other time is says &quot;Error connecting to server.Must be down. Click cancel and then start server to make your own&quot; ya ya... Well even if I start my own it wont work. What pisses me off is I can use the server once, then it logs me off when I&#39;m playing and I can&#39;t log back in! Help me.. I&#39;ve been &#39;trying&#39; to use MoparScape and I&#39;ve looked into it for a few months, and I know I just signed up for the forums but what ever &gt;_&lt; What do I have to do. I&#39;ve tried everything reasonable, but I can play it sometimes, and not at other times, so help my out :(</description>
