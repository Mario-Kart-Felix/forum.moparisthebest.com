Welcome to Real PvP

As your journey into true Pking begins, before we go any deeper lets talk buisness.
I&#39;m currently looking for the following

Client Programmer - Will keep client models/ background up to date.

Server Programmer - Will program server, and co own server.

Webmaster - Will maintain website, and update.

Gfx Artist - Will provide us with special Gfx&#39;s including Banners and background.

Owner ( Me ) - Will program the server and client, will also help with website, I also have some experience in Gfx&#39;s.

Before you consider yourself worthy of being any of those please take into mind I&#39;m very serious with this server and I&#39;ve
already started coding and my goal is to take this server to having 100+ members daily. We will also be releasing Beta&#39;s as we progress
towards finish the server, please note this server will never EVER be released. 

Application

Name;

Email;

Experience;

Postition(s);

Past Work;

Proof;

Timezone;

We will keep in contact over Msn and we can use dropbox so we can all code at once, if you do not know what DropBox is
It&#39;s basically a website where I upload file(s) and I invite you to them. We will than on basically share those file(s) and
we can edit at the same time directly from the dropbox folder. Edits I complete will also edit on yours automatically. This server
Will be on VPS, 

Things about the server looking to accomplish

Flawless Combat

Fixed Dupes

Clickable Commands in quest Tab

Castle Wars ( Optional )

Full Vesta, Morrigans, Ancient, Statius, &amp; Chaotics

As we speak I&#39;m currently programming the server so far this has been finished

- Shops

- Kbd

- Some Quest Tab Commands

- 80% Flawless Combat

- Pk Point System

- Titles depending on the amount of kills

- In Game hiscores

- Small Tutorial

- Many other things

Note: We will release some pictures as we near the ending, this will take no longer than 3 - 4 days programming basically before thanksgiving
everything will be completed (hopefully), Note this is a heavily modified Delta, 317 Server + Custom Client ( Not Bluurs or Corbies )
