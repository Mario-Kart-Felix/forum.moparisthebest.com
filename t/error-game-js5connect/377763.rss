    <description>Hello, I have expireance with runescape private servers in the past, but recently I have gotten back into working with these servers, also recently (and this has never happened before) I have been getting this error message on the client promp that says &#39;error_game_js5connect&#39;, also at the same time the loading screen freezes at &#39;loading title screen - 0%&#39;. Again, I have had expireance with Runescape private servers before but I am still pretty new at it. Lastly, and this may not be related, but when I try to login to a server via Moparscape.org, I can&#39;t log in and I get this message that says, &quot;Unexpected Server Response Please Try Using A Different World&quot;. I am using a 614 source. cache 614, and QROOT Client-Source. I have googled and looked up the same error and this site and youtube but I havn&#39;t been able to find anything that has solved the problem, please help!  :confused:</description>
