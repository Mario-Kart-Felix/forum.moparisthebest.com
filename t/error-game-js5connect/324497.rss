    <description>Basically i have a client with 9/10 times i get the above error. however when my friends use the same client to connect to the server they encounter no problems. I was told to open client.java client sided and change the ip to 127.0.0.1 this had no affect and i still had the problem. I was then told to change the ip to 0.0.0.0 this made the client work however it has now stopped working. any ideas?</description>
