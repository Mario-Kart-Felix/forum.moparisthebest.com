    <title>Thursday was crazy o.O</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thursday-was-crazy-o-o/172644</link>
    <description>There was a tornado Thursday, and out of all the places, it hit our school. We were all ducked down in our classrooms and the power went out, followed by a bunch of loud sounds. Then a teacher came to the door of our classroom and said &quot;Get everyone out of this side of the school, we&#39;ve got a gas leak.&quot; They yelled &quot;Everybody get out!&quot; and everyone was running out of the classroom into the main hall. They made us all duck in the main hall and wait for things to calm down. They made us move again because the chemistry lab was basically destroyed and chemical fumes were making people pass out (about 5-10 people passed out). One of my friends also went into shock and was taken away in a wheel chair. They finally started to evacuate people by the bus they rode. Mine was one of the first buses to be called, so I went out of the school to get on. I spotted my mom as I was on the bus. I got off the bus and my she was panicking. She told me about how she ran through some cops trying to stop her to get to the school. Her car was parked far away so we had to walk through the school parking lot, so we got to see most of the damage. Our building traits building had a bus crushed and on top of it, and the building was in ruins. Our gym collapsed. Another bus looked like somebody grabbed it by both ends and twisted it up. My friend, Eric, came to find his Firebird was under a bus. Most of the cars in the parking lot had their windows busted out. There were a few cars in the field that got thrown from the parking lot. As we walked down the road we saw houses missing walls and people gathering their stuff. Power poles were down everywhere, I&#39;m amazed I have power and internet right now. We came back to see how it was today and they wouldn&#39;t let us near it really, but there was several helicopters flying around it. Our school was the main spot that the tornado hit, which was ironic because no one expected our school to actually get hit.

Here&#39;s a vid of the damage:

And here&#39;s some news articles:

              <p>Well, my friend was the only person to be sent to the hospital from my school, the one that went into shock. 2 people died from car crashes due to the tornado, but no one really got hurt directly. No one from our school died. 11 people were hospitalized, one from my school. We are lucky, it could have been a lot worse</p>

Her car was parked far away so we had to walk through the school parking lot, so we got to see most of the damage. Our building traits building had a bus crushed and on top of it, and the building was in ruins. Our gym collapsed. Another bus looked like somebody grabbed it by both ends and twisted it up. My friend, Eric, came to find his Firebird was under a bus. Most of the cars in the parking lot had their windows busted out. There were a few cars in the field that got thrown from the parking lot. As we walked down the road we saw houses missing walls and people gathering their stuff. Power poles were down everywhere, I’m amazed I have power and internet right now. We came back to see how it was today and they wouldn’t let us near it really, but there was several helicopters flying around it. Our school was the main spot that the tornado hit, which was ironic because no one expected our school to actually get hit.</p>
<p>Here’s a vid of the damage:<br>
