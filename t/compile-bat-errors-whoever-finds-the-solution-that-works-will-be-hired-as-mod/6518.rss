    <description>Hello guys. I am making a server, I have done everything, then when i go to use compile.bat it says &quot;The system cannot find the path specified. Press any key to continue...&quot; Does anyone have a solution to this? And I set up the paths,


P.S: If you help me, and the solution works, I will hire you as gold mod on my server when I get it up and running. If I am not online just post and wait, or pm me.   ;)</description>

<p>Make sure your paths are 1.5.0_07, not _06. The tutorials say to set as 06, but if you get the newest java you need to set as _07. Make sure you do this in path, classpath aswell as compile.bat.</p>
