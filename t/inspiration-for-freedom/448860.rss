<p>About the OWS, the protest was peaceful. If you can make rules to prevent effective demonstrations then you are a fascist state.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:50, topic:448860”]xryz:<br>
No one is unbiased. The media has their own agenda, and without media on your side you won’t get the message out.<br>
Do you think there really is a peaceful solution? Wouldn’t that you plan only lead to some focus on the issue before it vanish again?</p>
<p>Let me quote something from one of the communist parties in Norway (translated) about the capital power.<br>
“They don’t want to give away their power out of free will. Because of that we need a revolution. Every other way are failing. The peaceful way leads to a case where they who want change, become a part of the system they want to abolish. They would become a part of the rulers, and get themselves an interest of keeping/protecting the system. Because of that revolution is the only way.”</p>
<p>So if we forget the peaceful “Change campaign” idea you have, and realize that you can’t get anything changed in the democratic system. How many other things can we do? The peaceful protest of OWS was shut down. Learn from the rebels in Libya and Syria, and get sympathy from the west. If you are lucky you might get help from NATO :D.[/quote]<br>
you may not be able to find people fully unbiased but the amount of bias a person has largely varies. the media does have their own agenda yes. The media would be a huge ally but thats only if they saw it in their agenda would it help. If its an organization that some people believe in its values and ideas then the awareness will be there as long as the organization, the amount of aware people would be the problem. Internet campaigns through youtube commercials would definitely help spread the word. plus if you recieved aid from larger companies and organizations that would help fond the campaigns.</p>
<p>that quote can apply to most if not all systems of government</p>
<p>OWS had sometimes when it wasnt fully peaceful. and camping inside cities like they did is against the law i thought. its their consititutional right to peaceful assembly but I don’t see where it gives you the right to live on someone elses land without their permission; the public streets may not be private property but most places ik you cant loiter, but idk what the punishments are if you loiter. ik that in some places in the US that homeless people get thrown in jail for being out on the streets :(. also in some instances people there had no idea why they were even there, the only reason they were there is their boss was paying them to be there and say stuff.</p>
<p>Idk if nato would even help. nato is made up of a lot of countries but without the US military NATO wouldnt stand much of a chance either. not to sound nationalistic but im pretty sure the US has the strongest military in every aspect; Air force, Navy, Marines, Army, and Elite forces(navy seals, green beret, force recon, army rangers), just look at how much the US spends on defense, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures</a> there is a reason why it should be. We spend 4 times the amount the next country does. sure china may have a larger military but 1: 20% of the worlds population lives in china, thats ~5 times the populations of the US; 2: our soldiers are probably superiorly trained in comparison; 3: we have much better military technology than any other nation and with our budget there would be something seriously wrong if we didnt.</p>
<p>also above all of that you are forgetting that fighting would be on our homeland, so we would have the home advantage and I may not personally know how well fortified the US is but I hear we are pretty good on home defense.</p>

<p>What? No, everyone can leave the US. Not in NK.<br>

I was not referring to being able to leave there. It was about the housing condition.</p>
<p>But back to the travel issue:<br>
Taking economy into account, does every homeless man in US have the ability to travel to Mexico or Canada if they wanted to?[/quote]<br>
if they tried hard enough, sure. that includes hitching rides but i depends if mexico or canada will allow them in, they only would need a passport if they wanted back in the US easily.</p>
<p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:38, topic:448860”]Who are going to put out this campaigns, and who do you think would send those?</p>
<p>If you want freedom in US you need to get a bunch of people with firearms and going all Arab spring on the government/corporations.[/quote]</p>
<p>non-profit organizations that is unbiased and works towards a common good for everyone. I dont understand the who would send part what are you meaning? If you had a bunch of people with firearms going arab spring(b/c the bill of right only allows peacefully rallies) then the national guard will be called in on them and they will all probably be charged with treason or something to trying to overthrow the government (even though in US government I remember something about if the majority of the nation was against the direction the government was taking they have the right of revolution).</p>
<p>it has been done once b4 im pretty sure back during or sometime after the vietnam war veterans protested in washington D.C. and they were met with the national guard. (I don’t recall if it was the Vietnam vets or some other vets but i remember some protest happening in DC some years ago way b4 i was born happening like that from my US history class but it has be like 4 years since then and my memory isnt that good.)</p>
<p>but anyways any militia the citizens of the US was able to form would be smashed like a bug b/c there would be no way they could stand a chance against such a powerful military that we have. It would literally be suicide and all be in vain, but maybe not completely it may wake some people up but then again the media would make it look bad for the militia and not the government.</p>

Just a small difference in not having the money to leave and not having the ability to leave because getting caught results in death, and even if you get past the most guarded border in the world, you will still likely be blown up by the largest mine field in the world.</p>
