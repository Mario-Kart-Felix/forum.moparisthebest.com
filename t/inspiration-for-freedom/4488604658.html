<p>Did you see how many people cried at kim jong ils funereal?  It probably is true, there is no real reason to fake it and ive heard about that story for a long time. Its more of exposing their ridiculous human rights rather than making fun of communism. You CAN have communism and a normal human rights system.  North Koreans are told they’re the leaders in education, technology, military etc around the world, and that they have the best quality of living and that just isn’t right.</p>
<p>They don’t talk about North Korea much here other than every now and again about them attempting to obtain nukes.</p>

What? You really think america is like that? We have commercials that show a list of countries leading in science and technology, and America is <span class="hashtag">#19</span> or something. The commercials are trying to tell America to help their youth “build a better foundation” so we can catch up.</p>
<p>We aren’t told were the leaders in military, redneck idiots just think that. As far as Navy technology goes we probably are, but thats it and only because the constitution says to give 1/4 of the federal budget to defense.</p>
<p>Middle class+ has a normal quality of living, and probably better than some of the UK (someone else made a comment about how much land around an American house that is owned by the house owner) and theres obviously no room in the UK for houses like that.</p>

        <p>If you have that from Amnesty International you should know that they are bias and have been caught spreading a distorted truth about DPRK. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9L74NSUEew&amp;hd=1" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9L74NSUEew&amp;hd=1</a><br>
If you want to argue about how trustworthy the UN is, feel free to.</p>
<p>Don’t you start every morning at US schools praising your own country like it was holy?<br>
Both US and DPRK tries to manipulate their people, I will say it is hypocrisy to point out the country as a bunch of nut jobs. And the question is, how much is true, how much is just a nice story, and how much is made up stories by the media.</p>
<p>The big problems in DPRK is not political evil, but due to ineffective agriculture. According to UNICEF many the problems lies in Western sanctions. The west are using the political situation to avoid helping them. It costs $198 million each year to help them with food.</p>
<p>And before you mention the big army, would you too build up a big army if United States wanted to attack you?</p>

You mean we put our hand on our heart and say the pledge of allegiance? Which some schools dont even do anymore… and you aren’t required to do it either… We don’t fucking bow down and drink from the holy fountain because our principle was born in the heavens.</p>
<p>I don’t know the whole deal with North Korea, just the problems its giving neighboring countries that are our allies and whatever.</p>
<p>In the US you can say “Fuck Obama” on TV or radio or in a magazine, and nothing happens. In NK youll be put in a camp.</p>
<p>The <span class="bbcode-b">US</span> doesn’t try and manipulate their people per say, the <span class="bbcode-b">media</span> does. The more whacked out the story the more viewers they get. More viewers = more money.</p>

<blockquote>Man, I'll try to go easy here but you really need to stop acting like a little kid. As a marxist you kinda make us look bad. I mean, you are defending North Korea! The same deformed workers state who﻿ imprisons their people for things as small as not "loving the Dear Leader". The same country who creates such a cult of personality around its leaders that they are compared to gods. No, this is not communism, This is a totalitarian dictatorship that only supports the political elite.</blockquote>

        <p>Yes, you shouldn’t defend anyone who get accused of doing horrible things. If I accuse Bush for war crimes, are you a bad person if you defend his acts? He is not trying to justify their acts, but prove that things aren’t as bad a people pretend they are. And you have more real choices in the North-Korean election than the US election. Four parties plus independents, all represented in the Parliament.</p>

<p>again I am cherrypicking situations but I am trying to make a point, you may be free to do these things but actions have consequences and those consequences may negate the freedom to do that action in the first place</p>
<p>an analogy I want to make is that your country has freedom from religion(which I absolutely love by the way, being from an officially christian country), however you are not FREE to pick your religion if you want to have a political career, during the 2008 presidential elections obama was accused of being an atheist, and he was also accused of being a muslim, do you really think a presidential candidate is free from religion when their religious beliefs will be attacked? this is a serious double standard and is very rarely addressed, by any country it affects and not just the us</p>
<p>ps, I was going to post a quote by president obama where he says america’s military is the best, but after reviewing the quote I got caught out on some damn fine creative writing,</p>
<blockquote>America’s military is the best that it’s ever been. We saw that most recently in the skill and precision of our brave forces who helped the Libyan people finally break free from the grip of Moammar Qaddafi</blockquote>
<p>of course he could have said ‘america’s military is at its peak’ but I think that wording was intentional</p>

<p>hence the “for all intents and purposes” to make a point, you’re not allowed to camp on private ground either where it would cause the owners distress (e.g., apple tree farm where harvesting the fruit would cause the owner distress)</p>
<p>I’m saying this from the perspective of a uk citizen where unless permission is sought you cannot camp in the wild at all, and receiving permission is extremely unlikely</p>
<p>you can camp in national parks in the states for up to 2 weeks or a month in remote areas but again you need permission, although from what I’m told permission is much easier to obtain</p>
<p>&amp; speaking of scandinavian prices, I had a £7/$10 burger at a fast food place in sweden and that price was about normal at all the fast food places we went to, but of course entry level jobs pay much more than in other countries which negates the cost difference (speljohan is making 3x after tax/costs what I would make before tax/costs if I got a full time job right now)</p>

<p>ox random xi: So Oxi, what do you believe is the core of the problem? And what do you believe in?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I believe the problem is the people. the ppl compromise the government and the ppl arent educated. the ppl don’t care. if they have the illusion of being free then the majority will be happy. sure lots of ppl feel like they arent free enough. Ppl seriously need to wake up and stop living in the world of just them. ppl need to become truly aware of how life is and stop conforming so that they are “Normal”.  (* I feel like i have more to say about problems of the civilians of a nation but atm im tired and need to sleep to i can hold a thought; even though i probably wont be able to for a bit.*)</p>
<p>A government should work for its ppl but is ppl should work for their government. not meaning the government provides everything for the ppl so the ppl dont have to do anything like some believe(welfare abusers; ik their are many in america that need it but there are also just as many that abuse it). The government is supposed to protect its ppl not just from outside forces but from the inside as well. meaning keeping its streets as close to crime free as possible. this is the basic idea for the foundation of the united states.</p>
<p>[quote=“ox random xi, post:12, topic:448860”][quote author=Bowser jr link=topic=551754.msg4042715#msg4042715 date=1341793503]<br>
Oxi, thank you. Who controls the Government in your opinion? And think again if you will say that government is the core problem. If you have changed your mind, please tell us what the real problem is.</p>
<p>The cliché is to believe in “Freedom”, who openly opposes freedom?<br>
[/quote]<br>
government oppresses freedom. Not openly, but they do.<br>
Corrupt people control the government.<br>
The day where man can rule himself is a day I’d love to live in but I see it no-where near sadly.[/quote]</p>
<p>you would not like to live in 100% freedom b/c there would be no one to stop your neighbor from making you their slave. for real think of living in federal prison except there are no guards there to protect you from what others will do to you also imagine this across the entire country in which you live so there are no safe zones anywhere and everyone is assumed out to get you. sure you could form gangs and stuff but in doing so you defeat the purpose of “total” freedom b/c now you have an allegiance to this gang you are now in.</p>
<p>I believe a “widely mixed government system”; federal, totalitarian, dictatorship/oligarchy(im guessing more closer to a republic parliament) with a communist/mixed economy (ik all the forementioned is confusing and may not make much sense but im probably just not explaining it correctly; this system of government will have checks and balances that keep the ones in power from being tyrants)would be a good way off ruling a country. ppl would disagree ik and understand why but in theory if well planned out and executed without corruption would operate efficiently and effectively for a long time. Most ppl would disagree with how i believe government should be but i guarantee that if they lived in the government that i have imagined im my head. then everyone would be asking themselves why wasnt this the first government ever and why did is take over 3000 years to put in to practice. but tbh what i have in mind probably couldnt work in the current state of the world but would be closer to being possible in 50-100 years.</p>
<p>geez i type way too much sorry.</p>
<p>I just hope the US gets more support politically and nationally for the <a href="http://www.fairtax.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fairtax.org/</a>. I feel like it is a good system and the US would benefit from a system such as it.</p>

<p>THAT is actually an issue. Because while you are NOT required to stand (by law) some teachers and principles get a bit too cocky and try and make you do it, and when you don’t they can end up sending you out of class. It really depends. Some teachers force you to do it. Some teachers will say “you don’t have to do it, but please don’t talk during it.” Others will ask them to at least just stand, which probably runs along the same lines of not wearing hats during class (blatantly disrespectful, some students do it just for attention).  In the end it just isn’t fair. Teachers were forced to take down pictures of McCain in their classroom while others weren’t told to take down their Obama posters.  Its stupid.</p>
<p>By law you don’t have to. But try sitting during it in Texas/Alabama and then try again in New York. MUCH different results.</p>

<p>Ik its people. its just quicker to type ppl. sorry if it bothers you its not like “1m 7y91ng 1ik3 d15”(sorry for that also)…</p>
<p>thats the first time ive heard of a “strawman” so i searched it up. I guess i could see the strawman thing but from how i interperated him; it sounded as if he wanted the freedom to do as he pleased and also allow everyone else. when you say freedom as in the pure ideal of freedom; freedom as i described is what comes to mind. I wasnt trying to misrepresentation of an his position. thats just how i understood him i was simply trying to show him where his logic failed if that was his logic.</p>
<p>I would say you must awaken the people in a series of well planned “campaigns”(i feel like that isnt the best word choice but its close enough) that target individual age groups. the Adolescence have power in influencing others older and younger, but we will also have to work on young adults through young elderly(50-60)(may actually have to split this group up in to sub groups b/c of different interests and are different in many ways) b/c that age group actually have the power to change the government if they are motivated enough. If we get enough people to care we can change the world in a positive way if we work together, but if we keep just going in our own separate direction then society as a whole will only degrade and way of life will get worse.</p>

I was not referring to being able to leave there. It was about the housing condition.</p>
<p>But back to the travel issue:<br>
Taking economy into account, does every homeless man in US have the ability to travel to Mexico or Canada if they wanted to?</p>
