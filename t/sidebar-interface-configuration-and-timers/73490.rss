    <title>!Sidebar/Interface configuration! And, Timers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sidebar-interface-configuration-and-timers/73490</link>
    <description>1.
Anybody know how to configure certain parts of a sidebar/interface? (Ex: What the sidebar/interface says) 

I know its something like sendquest, than what you want it to say, than the spots id number, but:

1. I dont know how correct this is

2. I don&#39;t which id numbers are for what interface/sidebar and for what spot.

Thx

(Oh, and PS, what does &quot;sendquest&quot; even mean or do?)


2.
Anyone know how to at a &quot;wait&quot; function, like in SCAR scripts? For example, in my TuT about noclippers, I have made it so when someone uses noclip, it makes them say something embarresing. But, I can&#39;t make them say more then 1 thing, or it will only say the last line of phrase. I know this is kinda confusing so i&#39;ll show an example:

Without a &quot;wait&quot; function:

[code]pSay(I like fat men)
pSay(Im just a noob, kill me)
pSay(Im gay)[/code]

But all the player says is &quot;Im gay&quot; Because the computer tries to make him say it all at the same time, so, something like:

[code]
pSay(I like fat men)
wait(500)
pSay(Im just a noob, kill me)
wait(500)
pSay(Im gay)
[/code]

So he&#39;ll wait 1/2 a second between sayings.
