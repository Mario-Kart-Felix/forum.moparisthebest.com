<p>Just out of curiosity, in rsc what does PId have to do with “catching”.

</aside>
<p>If I remember correctly - for some reason the players running both North and East were always catchable, no matter the PID. It was when people started running South and West that the PID had to be lower than the other person. Southeast and Northwest were THE most difficult to catch (it was impossible to catch from 2 squares away). Northeast and Southwest you could catch from 2 squares away.</p>

<p>RSCD based servers processed events based on the order the event (packet) was received, which makes a lot more sense. That means the foo’ who clicks first, plays first.</p>

<p>I do believe RSCDaemon v25 counts up also, although I might be mistaken. Although he’s right and I’m 100% sure on the fact that player-ID or “server-index”, however you wish to call it, it doesn’t matter for the player.</p>
<p>On RSC the lower your ID the “better” you were. All commands/packets were handled in the order of player ID, but on RSCD they’re handled in the order they come, so in other words - first come first serve.</p>
