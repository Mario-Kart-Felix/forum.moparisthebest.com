3. Then Log In Normaly Once Logged In Press SCAR And Run The Script. Right After You Run The Script Click On Runescape Again 
And Begin Playing Normally. 

4. Just Walk Around And Watch SCAR Do All The Hard Typing For You. Enjoy =)


&lt;----Summary----&gt;
Of all the versions made you can see what happened to them and witch is the newest versions that you can get.  

V.1: This was a very basic AutoTalker it was my first script. I wouldn&#39;t go expecting much becuase it was pretty basic with not any &quot;cool&quot; features.

V.2: This was another version of the series that was pretty much more like an update. This was my second script. I said to myself that the first one was to boring with just one sentence over and over, so I made this one. V.2 allows multiple words to be typed and used. This was named Multi Word

V.3: This AutoTalker has a very strange history. When I released V.2 I thought that it was a big deal but then people including me had doubts on its usefullness. It basically went through each letter you typed and would go in order over and over. This was a slight different than V.1 but it still didnt offer much protection. Thats were V.3 comes in. V.3 was a third script of mine that I had added random typing. SCAR would automatically choose between all of your sentences. This was named B.P for Better Protection.

V.3.2: This script was not much of a new version but more of an update of V.3. Because of this it was named to V.3.2 (There is no V.3.1 because the original is the 1) since it was an update. It just gave a countdown procedure. This remand the same as V.3 B.P.

V.4: V.4 was taken and rewriten to have added Anit-Randoms! Now you can be at a famous selling spot and just have SCAR declaring your text and just incase some random person would come to you and speak V.4 will deal with them and keep on going. V.4 has also been added with a feature that stops the procedure if your not logged into Runescape. Think about it this way if your not logged in it wont go typing all your edited text in things like Browsers that your in or even SCAR if your still on that. V.4 has been named New G.G for New Game Generation.

V.5: New!: V.5 has been added with new features! V.5 Includes Anti-Ban, a new step up for the LevExidus series. It now has the control to AutoLogin your player if not already logged in. It has now been added with new and improved Anti-Randoms!
It now has FindFastRandoms and some other randoms that would keep you in a tough situation. It has randoms including FindMime and more! V.5 was anme F.I.V.E for Formatted Inbetween Venom Entity! Just a long word saying that it was made with a lot of things going on around it, but still being made.(Think about being bitten by a snake and having to keep walking through the moantains with its venom inside you)

<p>&lt;----Summary----&gt;<br>
Of all the versions made you can see what happened to them and witch is the newest versions that you can get.</p>
<p>V.1: This was a very basic AutoTalker it was my first script. I wouldn’t go expecting much becuase it was pretty basic with not any “cool” features.</p>
<p>V.2: This was another version of the series that was pretty much more like an update. This was my second script. I said to myself that the first one was to boring with just one sentence over and over, so I made this one. V.2 allows multiple words to be typed and used. This was named Multi Word</p>
<p>V.3: This AutoTalker has a very strange history. When I released V.2 I thought that it was a big deal but then people including me had doubts on its usefullness. It basically went through each letter you typed and would go in order over and over. This was a slight different than V.1 but it still didnt offer much protection. Thats were V.3 comes in. V.3 was a third script of mine that I had added random typing. SCAR would automatically choose between all of your sentences. This was named B.P for Better Protection.</p>
<p>V.3.2: This script was not much of a new version but more of an update of V.3. Because of this it was named to V.3.2 (There is no V.3.1 because the original is the 1) since it was an update. It just gave a countdown procedure. This remand the same as V.3 B.P.</p>
<p>V.4: V.4 was taken and rewriten to have added Anit-Randoms! Now you can be at a famous selling spot and just have SCAR declaring your text and just incase some random person would come to you and speak V.4 will deal with them and keep on going. V.4 has also been added with a feature that stops the procedure if your not logged into Runescape. Think about it this way if your not logged in it wont go typing all your edited text in things like Browsers that your in or even SCAR if your still on that. V.4 has been named New G.G for New Game Generation.</p>
<p>V.5: New!: V.5 has been added with new features! V.5 Includes Anti-Ban, a new step up for the LevExidus series. It now has the control to AutoLogin your player if not already logged in. It has now been added with new and improved Anti-Randoms!<br>
It now has FindFastRandoms and some other randoms that would keep you in a tough situation. It has randoms including FindMime and more! V.5 was anme F.I.V.E for Formatted Inbetween Venom Entity! Just a long word saying that it was made with a lot of things going on around it, but still being made.(Think about being bitten by a snake and having to keep walking through the moantains with its venom inside you)</p>
