    <title>Python version and IDEs?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/python-version-and-ides/420177</link>
    <description>It&#39;s been awhile since I wrote much python code, and then it was generally just small projects for school involving a handful of files and I wrote them in a text editor like Kate, and it was python 2.5 I believe.  Now I plan on writing what will probably become a rather large project, and am wondering two things.

1. what version of python I should use and why? (2.x or 3.x)
2. Any good python IDEs?  I&#39;ve heard about Eric and Eclipse+PyDev.

Thanks if you can help me any.</description>

              <p>Ya, like Yume said, too many projects using 2.X<br>
So I use 2.7 though I often use <strong>future</strong> imports for some 3.0 functionality I like. Like the division of 3.0, I like it turning 2 / 3 into 0.6667 instead of an integer 0, then I don’t have to type cast everything into float or w/e. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>The problem is that it’s not just that simple. There are many backwards-incompatibilities in 3.x that makes compiling 2.x modules in 3.x more difficult, or else they all would have been compiled by now.</p>

<p>PyDev is one of the java ide plugins for Python IIRC.</p>
<p>TL;DR of 2.7 is sped up io module, tiling in tk, automatic field numbering and no futher dev.</p>

<p>I’d stick with at the latest 2.7 for the version and for the IDE I’ve always rolled SPE.</p>

I’m afraid I can’t help you much as I’m not a Python guy, but I’m curious what you expect to gain from an IDE that you’re not getting from your standard editor.</p>
<p>Not out to start a war, everyone already knows I’m pretty anti-IDE, just genuinely wondering what you feel you’re missing.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Good question.  A few things would be nice.</p>
<ol>
<li>Auto-completion: Kate has this, and it’s nice, but of course it doesn’t know anything about python, different classes, or different files, so it won’t fill in everything that it could like a python IDE could.</li>
<li>ctrl+click to go to class, field, or method clicked on.  I don’t know how to quite explain this, do you know what I mean?<br>
Ie, I’m in class A, I call a method from class B there, called foo, like so:  bee = new b; bee.foo(something), I want to know what .foo does, so I can hold ctrl and click on it and it takes me there.  Much better than searching through source code for it.  It’s pretty standard in Java IDEs.</li>
<li>Lastly, things I could probably script in an editor like kate, like compile and run buttons.  Maybe git integration?  I don’t know, sometimes that more gets in the way than just doing it from the command line.</li>
</ol>
<p>You don’t use any of those for ruby?  Also, I guess I could use ruby for this project, if I have to learn some new stuff for python 3 then maybe I will.  Meh.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Use 2.6, most people still use it. 3 doesn’t have gui stuff ported yet (as of last year?) and has slightly different object construction - I don’t think they changed much. I used gedit/pydev for eclipse.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, 2.6, that was it.  I don’t need any GUI stuff, it’s going to do a lot of parsing of web pages and storing that data in a database like mysql, so any front-end I use will be web based.  So based on that should I go ahead and use 3?[/quote]<br>
I don’t recall eclipse having auto-completion (or it did, but it was inconsistent) . gedit on the other hand has none. I’ve sort of gotten used to not having auto completion since I started learning c++</p>
