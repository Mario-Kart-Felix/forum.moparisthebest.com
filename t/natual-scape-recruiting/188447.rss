    <description>Natural-scape was a very popular server. One day it got deleted and every1 went crazy. The server was very close to the real RS. We have our own website and the website is under construction. Although it is somewhat done i need help in the website. I am posting here because i need people with java + php + mysql experience. one of the many things i need is how to make the username and password registered in the site work for the server, and you are not able to make new ones by just typing anything. 

Web designers with server experience!
