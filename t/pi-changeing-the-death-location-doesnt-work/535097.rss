    <title>[PI] Changeing the death location doesnt work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-changeing-the-death-location-doesnt-work/535097</link>
    <description>So, i tryed to find the exact coordinated where i die, and i recorded them, i ended up with x=2408, y=5087.
I try and locate that positing in the files, and i find teles to jad, since that location is the jad cave...
I found like, 3 segments of code that use this coordinate, i wanna know which one is the death coordinate so i can change it, heres the code
[code]public void resetTzhaar() {
//c.jadCave = false;
		c.waveId = -1;
		c.tzhaarToKill = 1;
		c.tzhaarKilled = -1;	
		c.getPA().movePlayer(2408,5087,0);
	}
[/code]
[code]public void enterCaves() {
		//c.getPA().movePlayer(2413,5117, c.playerId * 4);
				c.getPA().movePlayer(2408,5087, c.playerId * 4);
				//c.jadEvent();
		c.sendMessage(&quot;He will spawn in few seconds, pot up / pray!&quot;);
		c.sendMessage(&quot;To exit, run north and enter the cave!&quot;);
		c.waveId = 0;
		c.tzhaarToKill = -1;
		c.tzhaarKilled = -1;
		//Server.fightCaves.spawnNextWave(c);
		c.jadSpawn();
	}
	[/code]
[code]
				public void enterNewCaves() {
				if(!c.getItems().playerHasItem(6570, 1)) {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;You don&#39;t have a FireCape in you&#39;re inventory to sacrifice!&quot;);
				c.getPA().closeAllWindows();
				return;
				} else {
		//c.getPA().movePlayer(2413,5117, c.playerId * 4);
				c.getPA().movePlayer(2408,5087, c.playerId * 4);
				//c.jadEvent();
		c.sendMessage(&quot;Waves will spawn in few seconds, pot up / pray!&quot;);
		c.sendMessage(&quot;To exit, run north and enter the cave!&quot;);
		c.sendMessage(&quot;IF YOU RELOG YOU WILL HAVE TO RE-DO EVERY WAVE!&quot;);
		c.getItems().deleteItem(6570, 1);
		c.hasFollower = -1;
		c.waveId = 0;
		c.sendMessage(&quot;NOTE: You CAN loose you&#39;re items sometimes!&quot;);
		//Server.fightCaves.spawnNextWave(c);
		c.HardWaveSpawn();
	}[/code]
Maybe there is something else that needs fixing to change the death location? Please help! And thanks for reading this!</description>

              <p>So, i tryed to find the exact coordinated where i die, and i recorded them, i ended up with x=2408, y=5087.<br>
I try and locate that positing in the files, and i find teles to jad, since that location is the jad cave…<br>
I found like, 3 segments of code that use this coordinate, i wanna know which one is the death coordinate so i can change it, heres the code</p>
<p><code>public void resetTzhaar() {
//c.jadCave = false;
		c.waveId = -1;
		c.tzhaarToKill = 1;
		c.tzhaarKilled = -1;	
		c.getPA().movePlayer(2408,5087,0);
	}
</code></p>
<p><code>public void enterCaves() {
		//c.getPA().movePlayer(2413,5117, c.playerId * 4);
				c.getPA().movePlayer(2408,5087, c.playerId * 4);
				//c.jadEvent();
		c.sendMessage("He will spawn in few seconds, pot up / pray!");
		c.sendMessage("To exit, run north and enter the cave!");
		c.waveId = 0;
		c.tzhaarToKill = -1;
		c.tzhaarKilled = -1;
		//Server.fightCaves.spawnNextWave(c);
		c.jadSpawn();
	}
	</code></p>
<p><code>
				public void enterNewCaves() {
				if(!c.getItems().playerHasItem(6570, 1)) {
				c.sendMessage("You don't have a FireCape in you're inventory to sacrifice!");
				c.getPA().closeAllWindows();
				return;
				} else {
		//c.getPA().movePlayer(2413,5117, c.playerId * 4);
				c.getPA().movePlayer(2408,5087, c.playerId * 4);
				//c.jadEvent();
		c.sendMessage("Waves will spawn in few seconds, pot up / pray!");
		c.sendMessage("To exit, run north and enter the cave!");
		c.sendMessage("IF YOU RELOG YOU WILL HAVE TO RE-DO EVERY WAVE!");
		c.getItems().deleteItem(6570, 1);
		c.hasFollower = -1;
		c.waveId = 0;
		c.sendMessage("NOTE: You CAN loose you're items sometimes!");
		//Server.fightCaves.spawnNextWave(c);
		c.HardWaveSpawn();
	}</code><br>
Maybe there is something else that needs fixing to change the death location? Please help! And thanks for reading this!</p>
