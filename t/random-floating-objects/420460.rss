    <title>Random floating objects?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/random-floating-objects/420460</link>
    <description>I finally got my private server online and everything, but now in some places, there are random floating dragon chainbodies, horned cyclops heads, and other random objects. Also, the gates look really weird, some are replaced with random objects, and the gates open really weird as well.

Is this a common problem? Is there a way to fix this? What&#39;s wrong?

P.M me for more details.</description>
