    <title>Car troubles-- &#39;91 grand prix</title>

    <description>I figure not many/anyone on this forum is a mechanic, but it&#39;s worth a try anyway (especially if someone knows one).

My 1991 Pontiac Grand Prix is having some issues lately. It was sitting in our garage for a few years, and then my dad fixed it up and gave it to me (he was a mechanic some 20 years ago). The car has a delay in accelerating, terrible brakes, and would spontaneously die at stops.

It just took a turn for the worse (after putting a mere ~5,500 miles on it). When I was driving it the other night, it was shaking when accelerating around 35mph. I drove it back to my house and let it warm up. Going around a corner next to my house the car completely died. My dad spent about 10 hours this week going through and changing a ton of stuff. He cleared the fuel filter, redid the ignition system, and fixed two vacuum leaks. The problem still happens.

Here&#39;s a bit more in-depth: when the car is in park, it makes a very subtle tapping sound toward the back of the car, but doesn&#39;t really shake. When the car is in drive, it whirs and sounds as though it&#39;s skipping RPMs. It throttles low and high RPMs, even when not moving. It shakes no matter what speed it&#39;s at, and the acceleration is very hesitant. Before this problem, the car would hesitate a bit when accelerating from 0, but now it hesitates even if I hold down the pedal.

Google wasn&#39;t much of a help, but it seems like it could be the crank shaft censor. Nevertheless, I&#39;d rather have this problem fixed by my dad rather than having to take it into a shop to get it fixed (being a college student, I don&#39;t exactly have a lot of money to through around). If anyone has strong mechanical knowledge or knows someone that does/that has had this problem, any help at all would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:2, topic:425191”]It could be any number of problems.  The whirring towards the back sounds like it could be the fuel pump, and that would explain the acceleration problems.  Is the check engine light on?  If so, you can get a diagnostic code from the computer that might point you in the direction of what is wrong.</p>
<p>Honestly though, depending on what the problem is, and how much a fuel pump is, it might be cheaper to take it to a mechanic to get it diagnosed rather than just replace things (if the pump is $15, go for it, if it’s $300 though?).[/quote]</p>
<p>The check engine light isn’t on. My dad says he’s simply running out of equipment to try and diagnose it. The car is pretty old, so I dunno. I might just have to take it to a mechanic and face the music.</p>
