    <title>Router hassle, BT Home Hub 4</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/router-hassle-bt-home-hub-4/552646</link>
    <description>This is a UK router, I have had this for a short while now and when it comes to port forwarding this router is horrible.

Has anyone ever dealt with this particular router before when messing with ports? Even called up my ISP and they are useless  :palm:.</description>

              <p>Thanks for that detailed post bengina.</p>
<p>I have covered all of these steps, and connections were still not coming through. I found a video on YouTube after a vast search and I think I have it sorted.</p>
<p>I’ll see if I can accept incoming connections, as my ports say they are open…</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

              <p>The BT Home Hub has an in-built firewall and can handle game and application sharing/port forwarding for gaming.<br>
To set up these features:<br>
Open the BT Home Hub Manager by typing <a href="http://192.168.1.254" rel="nofollow noopener">http://192.168.1.254</a> into your browser<br>
You’ll be prompted to enter your password. If you haven’t changed it previously you’ll find it on the Hub Settings Card that you pull out from the top of the Hub<br>
Enter your password and click OK<br>
Click Continue to Advanced Settings<br>
Click Firewall in the menu<br>
Check to see if the game/application is listed in the Game or application drop down. If it’s not there then you’ll need to read the other instructions below…</p>
<p>What to do if the game/application is not listed</p>
<p>Create a new game or an application by clicking Manage games and applications from within the Port forwarding screen then follow these steps. You must know the details of your port forward at this stage.<br>
Enter a name for the game or application<br>
To create a variant of a game or application that is already defined select Yes next to Copy an existing game/application then select the game/application in the list<br>
To add a new game/application select No next to Copy an existing game/application<br>
Enter Protocol &gt; Port range &gt; Translate to as appropriate for the rule you are adding<br>
Click Add.<br>
If there are multiple protocols/ranges for this rule repeat steps 4 and 5 as appropriate<br>
Click Apply<br>
Go back to Port forwarding<br>
Select the name chosen in step 1 in the ‘LH Game/Application’ box and in ‘RH Device’ box<br>
Select User defined IP address and then manually enter IP addres<br>
Select Add then Apply…</p>

<p>the bt hub has gotten worse with each version, and even v1 was a colossal piece of shit. if this is just adsl, go on amazon and buy a normal adsl2+ modem router for £30 and save yourself the hassle. obviously before buying any specific model, download the manuals and make sure it can do what you want it to do…</p>

</aside>
<p>Thanks for the reply. When I contacted BT they wanted £30 just to look into it, so I told them I pay enough per month for my Phone/Broadband and TV package without being ripped off even more.<br>
I have previously had this router port forwarded but it was a while back and I can’t even remember how I managed to get it done.</p>
<p>Yes, these home hubs are utter garbage but I didn’t really want to buy another router when I know it can be done, just needed to know how again.</p>
