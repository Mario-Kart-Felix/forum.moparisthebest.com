    <description>Ok ive been struggling with this one for awhile. I want to have bank tabs and the newer bank look.. i tried the tutorial for it and all that good stuff but the problem with my bank is that in the cache it has the newer bank sprites but yet it shows the older bank.. i dont understand why its showing the older bank if it has the newer bank sprites in the cache.. how would i change it to the newer bank look so i can start adding tabs??
BTW im using the TrisidiaX Final Release as my base...</description>

              <p>Just because you have an image doesn’t mean it’s being used… To put it simply.</p>
<p>Look in the RSInterface.java of your client to see if there’s any method that uses the sprites you mentioned.</p>
<p>And then if there is, look to see if that method is being used when the client loads (So search to see if there’s a second result of the method name)</p>
