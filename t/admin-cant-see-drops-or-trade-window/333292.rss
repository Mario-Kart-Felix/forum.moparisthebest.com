    <title>Admin can&#39;t see drops or trade window?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/admin-cant-see-drops-or-trade-window/333292</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;ve recently promoted one of my mods to a global moderator so he can ipban, and ipmute. One problem, he cannot trade anyone, or see any drops from any monsters. I tried every way I could possibly think to fix this. I searched every playerrights ==2, and every playerrights &gt;=2.

I can&#39;t seem to find a solution, can anyone help? Thanks!</description>
