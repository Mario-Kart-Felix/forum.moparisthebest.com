    <description>Well i wanted to request 2 things..

#1. NPC following if a play attacked and ran but if player ran for a certain amount of tiles the npc following and attacking would reset until re-attacked....And while the npc is followed if some1 else attacks the npc while its following a player the npc would direct its attention 2 the player that just attacking.

#2. A very good clan system. This clan system would have commands as follows :

::createclan *Clan Name* (Creates a clan)
::deleteclan (Deletes that clan you own)
::addmember *Member Name* (Would send a teleother interface to the selected plaything asking to join the *Clan Name* if they click yes they join if no they dont. ONLY WORKS FOR LEADER)
::removemember *Member Name* (This would only work for leader but it would remove the selected member name from the clan.)
::clanlist (Would list all the members in your clan)
::setclanhome (This is only for the leader but it will set the current Position of the leader to the ::clanhome teleport command.)
::clanhome (Teleports you to the set clan home..Will NOT work while in combat.) 
::clanbank (Dunno if this will be possible but if a player is in a clan and they type ::clanbank it would open a seperate bank that ALL clan members can see. I dont think it would work but id be happy with it.)
::clanchat *MESSAGE HERE* (This would send the message in the command to only the people in the clan including yourself.)

Thanks if you could do this...ADD MY MSN manbearpig101@hotmail.com</description>

              <p>Thats a lot to request. I would highly suggest coding it on your own, then you will have all the rights.<br>
If you really want it, you will code it your self.</p>
