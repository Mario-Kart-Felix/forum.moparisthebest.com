    <title>LegendScape Comes to an End?!?!?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/legendscape-comes-to-an-end/108032</link>
    <description>[hr]
 	Systems have crashed at the office of LegendScape Corporation. The crash has left our system disabled. There is a high-risk chance that the years of work that went into the source of LegendScape will all be deleted. There were no backups made. The cause of the crash has been located to a Windows Update Error. This error is the annoying mandatory pop-up you see that says restart now, or restart later and when you click restart later it pops up in 4 seconds.
 	We will try and salvage all that we can by tomorrow night. The System will be sent back to the original creator in hopes that they can bring it back and save the game we know as legendscape. If by chance LegendScape is unable to recover the source. LegendScape will discontinue the Private server portion of our business.
 	We are sorry to have informed you of this information. LegendScape will [b]not[/b] by any means halt any other department of the business. The Error was caused by negligence on the part of the programmers for windows update compatibility. Appropriate actions will be taken if any conceivable damage has been done to the system. LegendScape is well prepared to take the matter as far as the head of the department deems necessary.
	Again, all other departments of LegendScape will remain open and operational. All questions and queries should be directed toward the head of the department at either Administrator@legendscape.net or Jarrett.Wilson@legendscape.net. Please remember that the fault of the system was not caused by an attack nor was it an intentional closing. LegendScape Security is working on the matter.

              <p>Excuse my low level user. E-mail and or call microsoft up personaly and ask them for their reccords and they will back us up. Second of all it is unwise to speak with such lack of knowledge as you have. Because the cause of this error was faulted by windows compatibility issues. Again I ask you no I urge you to call microsoft up and ask for the reccords in person so that they can verbaly tell you what I have already done. As for other conserns please contact administrators or high ranked staff officials for the information you wish.</p>
<p>My task is not to respond personaly to that of stupid statements of blunt stupidity. So I will leave and have legendscape himself decide wether to respond or not.</p>
<p>Moderators and Administrators if a poster/user requests the IP of this login please give it out with my permision. This IP can be compared to that of LegendScape’s Himself. That will prove matters.</p>
<p>goodbye.</p>

              <p>Uh huh.  Yeah.  Sure.  It’s easy to put a link to Microsoft and say you are partnered with them.  Its also easy to steal a chemical company’s stock quote and call it your own.<br>
Don’t lie about being a corporation just because you and some friends you found on MSN decided to be.  Also, I’m pretty sure Microsoft wouldn’t affiliate with somebody that’s only been around a few months (According to your websites history).</p>
<p>Prove me wrong and I will change my opinion, but right now, I hold the same as before.</p>
<p>Besides, the Windows update thing happens to a lot of people with XP.  Either change what is crashing your comp or just admit that its nothing…</p>

              <p>no apperently you know very little of the situation. That was not the case and it isnt that easy. LegendScape holds more data then your computers can hold therefor saving them is harder then usual standards. and yes it is Corporation <a href="http://LegendScape.net" rel="nofollow noopener">LegendScape.net</a> also check with microsoft We are partnered with them. They can send you the information to back us up.</p>
