<p>Rather have a PKing server to play on once in awhile honestly. Was surprised to come back after quitting RS for a few years to find hardly any servers up anymore lol. Wish I could get my old StorkPK server up just for fun lol</p>

<p>Why do you keep posting shit that I helped anyone from codexrsc? Who are you anyways?<br>
I have never once helped them do anything at codex. I have already admitted I spawned items at rscr, who gives a fudge, the server was going downhill anyways. I was the only active one there for the last 3 months before it shutdown. Had the other staff stayed active, that server may still have been up and I wouldn’t have done what I did.[/quote]I spoke to rodgerwilco about this on multiple occasions and he seems to be of the belief that codexrsc hasn’t changed anything, and that it’s operated by a bunch of out-of-touch idiots. I think you’re being pretty bold admitting that you spawned items on rscr though… it had a flourishing economy and you kids went and ruined it by spawning everything. You could have at least been subtle about it?! I don’t think you can justify that sort of behaviour at all.</p>
