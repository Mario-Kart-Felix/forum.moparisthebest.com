    <title>What is your preferred forum software?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-your-preferred-forum-software/480504</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to start up a forum, I&#39;ve been working on images mostly, and some content, but I was wondering, what forum software do you prefer and why?

Me personally, I prefer SMF because it is what I&#39;m used to, I tried one other one (Phpbb?), and I didn&#39;t really get it, I might try it again though.</description>

              <p>PHPmyBB is something I’ve used a lot in the past. I haven’t used SMF much but it seems really good.<br>
Free software wise those two are the best that I know off. I’m not sure about paid, vB is good but confusing allegedly though.</p>

              <p>I prefer SMF as I can edit the PHP code to have multiple forums run on a split database if chose. Even went as far as having shared groups with separate permissions per forum lol.</p>

              <p>SMF is unmatched by any other forum software in my opinion, it has a bad past of glitches and bugs etc but the majority of them were wiped in the 2.0 installation and the other known bugs have been ironed out since then. People think that just because SMF is free vB and IPB must be better softwares, no. They are more noob-friendly but if you know basic PHP you can do anything either of those softwares do and often faster. SMF also offers the SSI, something that is unmatched by any other forum software.</p>

<p>That is true. And as far as I know, SMF is one of the most popular ones, so it has a lot of mods that you can add to it.</p>
