    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/netwealth-in-yell/551869</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been searching for quite some time for a 667 method that makes it so that when you yell, along with your name, it displays your net wealth. In this method it has things that calculate your inventory value, bank value, and gear value, etc, and place it in your yell. Does anyone have this method? Let me know, really need it.</description>

It helps if you provide something for us to work with…</p>
<p>I can tell you how to make a tree “infinite”. But without seeing the code, you’re going to read what I say and wonder where to begin.</p>
<p>It’d really depend on your code.<br>
I assume your woodcutting system has a method where you cut the tree and it uses a client object as a argument.<br>
You’d first add a method that returns a boolean into player.java, checking if the player is in the area of the custom trees (Alternatively you could check the tree’s coords against the same method, but having an x and y argument instead of none, and the method would probably not have to be in Player.java).<br>
Then in your woodcutting method, in the code that removes the tree (It’ll be like createObject or removeObject or something similar) add an if statement <span class="bbcode-b">around</span> it. The if statement will be checking if the method you created above is FALSE. if it is false, then go ahead and delete the tree… If it’s true, they’re in the zone, so keep the tree.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>tldr: remove the line that deletes the object or creates the stump  :D[/quote]<br>
No, because he only wants the trees in that zone to do it…<br>
Now if he wanted it globally, then yes, it’d be easier to just comment out the line.</p>

              <p>For the second problem you have. Sometimes to solve problems I have is to check out other code.<br>
So lets say you have a normal tree look for something in your files that makes it come back so then you can add it to your custom code you have added. If you don’t understand PM me or reply here.</p>

              <p>Well I’ll just look into myself then. Can you guys help me with one other problem? So there are these trees in the skilling zone I created, and once you chop them down they’re gone for a long ass time. How can I make it so the tree never dissapears and you can always cut it.</p>
