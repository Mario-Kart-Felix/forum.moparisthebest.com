    <title>Getting frame input</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-frame-input/447698</link>
    <description>I&#39;m making a cooking class and I want it to have the original frame that says &quot;shrimp&quot; and when you right click it, it says &quot;cook 1, cook 5, cook x, cook all&quot;. I have the frame there and it displays correctly, however it does nothing when I click an option. Does anyone know how to get the input from the click? For example, if the user clicks &quot;cook 5&quot;, then it would return the integer 5. I should have no problem making it cook 5, I just need to know how to get the input in the first place.
Thanks.
