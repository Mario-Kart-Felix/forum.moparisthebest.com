    <title>Forums Upgrade?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/forums-upgrade/33145</link>
    <description>For the admins that never knew yet, SMF v1.1 has been fully released. I just saw this forums is using SMF 1.1 RC2, while RC3 was out months ago. Also, I had no idea where to post this because there is no offtopic section. Every section has to do with Runescape.</description>
