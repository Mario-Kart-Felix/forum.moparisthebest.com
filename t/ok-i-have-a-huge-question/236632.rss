    <title>Ok i have a huge question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ok-i-have-a-huge-question/236632</link>
    <description>Ok so i wasnt sure what forum this should be in but i thought this would be the most relevant forum :P

ok to my point. I&#39;m starting up a new server ( not gna say the name ) and well im a basic java coder and well i need someone to do the client side of the server. i have tried but well it&#39;s too complicated for me i dont know how to add models etc. 

so is anyone up for the challenge? btw i dont have a hoster yet so if you can also help with that if not i may have someone to host.

ok so heres a list of realy what i need:

1. Be able to add items + specials
2. a good knowledge of clients
and some other stuff i cannot think off  

there is one other person helping with the server but a the moment he is busy and like me he cannot code client :P lol

cheers

i make this relevant by saying &quot;im askin for help with my client :P&quot;[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 14, 2008, 01:07:15 pm[/size][hr]bump :S</description>

<p>just go to downloads section and download galkons client… and then search a tut on how to edit it…</p>
<p>why would someone make a client for someone else when they could be working on one for themselves??</p>
