    <description>Hey guys! is there any way for me to convert a client to Java 6? I am running Java 6 because I only have macs in my house and i would like to play on server but all the clients are in Java 7. I get the unsupported major minor version 51 50 error. I know this means i need to update my java but my mac is currently only 10.6.8 when Java 7 requires 10.7, which i am upgrading to within a month because i need to purchase the upgrade for 20$. Sorry if my Grammar/spelling is bad im very tired.</description>

              <p>So if you right click your compiler then click edit, change your java to whatever you want to use.<br>
I hope this is what you were asking</p>
