    <title>Looking for 1 content and 1 web developer [F2P Remake]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-1-content-and-1-web-developer-f2p-remake/470487</link>
    <description>The source is a F2P (free-to-play) remake. I haven&#39;t done any work to it since the last release and don&#39;t intend to until the development team is full. We already have a client developer. The source is a Delta, that&#39;s not changing. Don&#39;t apply if you&#39;re not okay with that. 

The latest release can be found here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,587965.0.html

[b]Web Developer Requirements[/b]
-Must have an understanding of HTML and possibly a basic understanding of JavaScript and CSS.
-Must be able to show work to prove your experience.
-Must be fairly respected on any RSPS community.
-Must have skype.

[b]Content Developer Requirements[/b]
-Must have an understanding of Java.
-Must be able to show work to prove your experience.
-Must be fairly respected on any RSPS community.
-Must have skype.

Both applicants must speak and type good English. Whether it&#39;s your first language or not is irrelevant. You must have a good sense of responsibility, be a team-player and adequately meet deadlines. Nobody likes a buzz kill, a good sense of humour wouldn&#39;t hurt :)

[b]Application:[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Position:
Experience:
Why should I choose you?:
Additional Information:
Skype:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]Good luck![/b]</description>
