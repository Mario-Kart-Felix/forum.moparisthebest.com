(It goes slower then this, I increased it for the example)

I hope people enjoy this source, it&#39;s pretty much PI but based entirely on PK&#39;ing and a pvp world. There is a distinct artifact system. I&#39;m pretty sure every one of you can rip some of my shit from this source.

No claws.
No ancient curses.
474 lookalike.

There may be some errors in the cmd 

Flame away, haters.[/i]
