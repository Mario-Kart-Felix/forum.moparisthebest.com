    <title>Player updating problem [solved]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-updating-problem-solved/546420</link>
    <description>I had an error when logging in into the game.
I narrowed the error down to here:

[code=java]
if((i &amp; 4) != 0)
		{
			player.textSpoken = stream.readString();[/code]

Which is obviously the &quot;forced chat&quot; state update for the player.
It throws an array out of bounds on the text spoken.

The weird part, why I don&#39;t know how to solve this, is that I&#39;m not sending a &quot;forced chat update&quot; to the client.

Does anybody have an idea how this can happen and how to solve it?
Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>I’ve narrowed down the error even further,<br>
my appearance update (send by the server) sends as bitmask -1<br>
experimenting around there atm</p>
<p>edit:<br>
This prints out as -1, is it supposed to do that?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">bitMask |= 0x10;</code></pre>
<p>Edit:<br>
I had put the default as -1 instead of 0.<br>
Leaving this in case somebody else is that stupid and needs help.</p>

<p>Clearly the string terminator is not being found (maybe it’s written in a different string format or something).</p>
