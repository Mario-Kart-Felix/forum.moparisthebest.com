    <description>I&#39;m a fairly wealthy player, my total assets probably add up to around 150-200m. I made it all through sniping and item-flipping, possibly the best way to make money through the grand exchange if you have limited resources. 

I&#39;m looking to start a merchanting clan, now I&#39;m going to be honest [b]all merchanting clans[/b] are Ponzi schemes, I was a general in one for a while, then even I got kicked out when the owner made his share and left.

I&#39;m looking for a few partners with assets about 50m+ and have medium-high experience in price fluctuation/manipulation. 

3-4 partners would be best, everyone would get an equal cut of the pie (except for myself of course) (share) of the virtual company, everyone would have an equal responsibility to advertise to the general public.

This is the opportunity of a lifetime, let&#39;s take advantage of Runescape&#39;s close to laissez-faire economy and it&#39;s loose regulations, and reap the virtual gold of the commonwealth. 

You may say &quot;TheUnforgiven&quot; but doesn&#39;t Runescape have like laws that prevent price manipulation, such as a certain quantity of items you can buy in a certain time period?

Yes, but it&#39;s easily exploited, because in real life the government can control the acts of a company as a whole, but Jagex can&#39;t in Runescape, because we&#39;re not an official enterprise just a loosely banded group of entrepreneurs that all invest in one item( or stock)

I won&#39;t post anymore information about the clan or even the runescape chat ingame.

But if you would like to apply to be a partner fill out this application:

Total Net Wealth:
Total Investment Potiential: 
Experience in Price Fluctuation/Manipulation in a virtual economy:
MSN:

After filling this out I will send you a pm with an invite to become a partner or even join the clan.
Remember, there are only 3-4 partner positions, and possibly a few corporate executive positions.

 &quot;Make it Rain&quot;

The Unforgiven.</description>
