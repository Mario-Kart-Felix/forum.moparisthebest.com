    <title>Physical Gay Features</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/physical-gay-features/154142</link>
    <description>Hey,

     I thought this was pretty interesting. There is a study that says that there are four subtle physical aspects of someone that leans them towards the more homosexual or heterosexual side. I think I believe this, I am gay, and I exhibit 3 out of four of these.

[url=http://nymag.com/news/features/33520/]Here&#39;s the link[/url], but for those who cba to check the 7 pages, I summarized it.

1.) Gay men are more likely to have counterclockwise hair whorls in the back of their heads. I partly agree with this. I don&#39;t have this and I know a few other gay men who don&#39;t. I think the more feminine gay men have this.

2.) Gay men and lesbians are more likely to have wide fingerprints. I haven&#39;t really checked my gay friends, but I do, so I guess I can&#39;t say this is completely wrong.

3.) Gay men are more likely to have ring fingers longer than their index fingers. I am a firm believer in this, because ever since I was a kid, I noticed this as one of the little differences between me and all the other little boys, and after I read this, I asked my friends to check, and almost all of their ring fingers are also longer.

4.) Gay men and lesbians are more likely to be either be ambidextrous, or left handed. Say what you will of this, I personally am ambidextrous.

That&#39;s about it. I exhibit 3/4 of these and I am gay, so I guess it&#39;s true, what do you guys think?</description>

              <p>Alright, I just read everything. Please let this be the last off-topic post, as I made this as just another post as a little fun thing you could look at yourself and say hey, I’m straight, but I exhibit 3 out of 4 gay physical features.</p>
<p>I’m gay. I’ve known I was gay since I could remember. My mother knew I was gay, she told me that when I came out. Mopar, you are right, I could choose not to have sex with men. I could choose to act straight, and there wouldn’t be anyone thinking different of me. But, there’s something your not bringing into factor. I’m gay because I like men, and don’t like women. You can’t decide whether or not you want to enjoy being a homosexual, because it’s like deciding whether or not you like a certain kind of food that you never get used to. No, I’m not straight, last year, I lost my virginity to a girl last year in early March, let’s just say… I didn’t enjoy it.</p>

              <blockquote>I don't believe that, I think it is a choice they make.  No one is born gay, obviously that is not the way nature intended things to work, and therefore nature would never produce something that worked like that.  The purpose of any living being is to reproduce and propagate, since gay people do not do this, it is impossible for someone to be born gay.</blockquote>
<p>Nobody is born gay but that does not mean it is a choice. Do you choose where and how you are raised and by whom? Human beings are only made of the genetic material they have inherited and the experiences they have had, so if a preteen decides he’s gay, he hasn’t really had the chance to choose the life experiences which define him.</p>
<p>“The purpose of any living being is reproduce and propagate.”</p>
<p>Living things don’t have a simple purpose. Physics and metaphysics are not white and black, there is no good or evil or right or wrong that can be proven empirically, and no purpose to an object other than which is defined by the observer. Human purpose, of action fulfilling thought, is the individual. At first all reality is formless, and then human intellect observes and labels, gives names to raw image-thought. On top of pure sense, there is abstract, hypothetical thought. Most animals cannot think about what they have not sensed or are not sensing at an instant. The ability to imagine and dream and hope, more than just fucking, defines the purpose of human beings.</p>

<p>Theres some, trying to find one on the openly gay one, I know I saw it somewhere.[br][size=1]Posted on: October 25, 2007, 10:39:33 PM[/size][hr]For openly gay, IE, they’re banning in California (I think) and South Florida (really good chance)<br>
[center]<img src="http://www.moparisthebest.org/smf/Themes/default/images/warnwarn.gif" alt width="" height=""> Rule 5[/center][/quote]</p>
<p>How you might not have realized but San Francisco. Hello? doesn’t everyone know that?</p>
<p>anecdote: At summer camp I was messing around with my t shirt and i had rolled it into a ball girl style. ( as a joke) my counselor turned around and said: are you sure you aren’t from San Francisco?</p>
<p>So there is pretty much no chance of banning gayness, but gay marriage is banned here ( in CA)</p>

Murder, rape, etc is wrong, yes. But you can’t compare them to Homosexuality.<br>
You can change it, but only by heavy influence… And even so, people should just live life not worrying about what is the right thing by society. The sun’s gonna burn up eventually anyway and the world will be fucked, if not by a comet or global warming, why care about other people when there is so much more to be worrying about.</p>
<p>About the choice thing, you’re saying you could turn gay right now?</p>

<p>You should respect everyone, but also there is the issue over whether being gay is right or not.  It is a choice that anyone can decide either way on, but society disallows certain choices, like the choice to murder someone for example, so should people be allowed to be gay?  That is a choice as well I guess.[/quote]<br>
It’s not a choice you can change, like legit (I think) said, you don’t just wake up and say “Hey, i’ll be gay.”</p>
<p>People should be allowed to be whoever they want, you can’t extinct Homosexuality.<br>
It is not wrong, at all. People only see it as wrong due to the negative thoughts influenced upon them by others. If we had a world where everyone respected everyone there would be no “Homosexuality is wrong” bullshit.</p>
<p>The whole “god made adam and eve, not adam and steve” stuff is just crap. If god, the creator of everyone and everything allowed the possibility of Homosexuality then why is it wrong?</p>
<p>I don’t know if you think it’s wrong, I’m just saying.</p>

<p>You should respect everyone, but also there is the issue over whether being gay is right or not.  It is a choice that anyone can decide either way on, but society disallows certain choices, like the choice to murder someone for example, so should people be allowed to be gay?  That is a choice as well I guess.</p>

A lot of countries today are banning being openly gay. I’m straight but I’ve learned to respect everyone no matter what. And yea, people aren’t born gay, it’s not an infectious disease, nor is it a disorder, it’s a choice. Deal with it.</p>

<p>Is it impossible for nature to cause mutations that end up in something that disadvantages the individual?  The basis of natural selection is that some individuals get sacrified by having genes that affect their fitness/reproductive ability.  Some people are born infertile, is this not along the same lines as being born gay?  Also, I cannot imagine anybody in the world simply making the decision to be gay.  I could not just wake up and say to myself, I think I’ll go against the norm and shove my dick up male assholes instead of female pussy where it belongs.  No, I think some people either are born with the natural inclination for males, or they develop it through some traumatic process.</p>
<p>EDIT:  And what’s with everyone coming out of the closet all of a sudden?</p>

No one is born gay, obviously that is not the way nature intended things to work, and therefore nature would never produce something that worked like that.  The purpose of any living being is to reproduce and propagate, since gay people do not do this, it is impossible for someone to be born gay.</p>
