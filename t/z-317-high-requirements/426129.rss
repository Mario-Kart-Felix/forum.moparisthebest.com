Was more refering to blakescape as you said you would start out with it. And why not save the hassle of cleaning 900kb of code and just use something more OOP like hyperion or apollo. Shards revolution is actually pretty nice, just dont see why you are fooling around with blakescape.</p>

<p>The whole reason why they want personal information is for communication purposes. I can agree to that, its important. Hell if one of my employees vanished I want to know what is going on, so communication other than Forums, MSN, or IRC is important. Phones are not directly linked to here and if I want your phone number, then I will request for it. Like I said, especially if we are working together or you are working for me.</p>

Posting on Moparscape is weird in my mind as well. This forum has good developers, yes, but scouting the forum instead of posting would have been an easier. Most of the good people, don’t usually associate themselves with a forum anymore. Sure they come by, but they most likely won’t post here. They might come to you, or you come to them. With the amount of expectations, which aren’t hard to meet at all, you will see people who will set you back in the future applying.</p>
