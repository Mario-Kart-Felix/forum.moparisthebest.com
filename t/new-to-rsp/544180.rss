    <description>Hello guys,
I thought about hosting a RS server. Well, this is my very first time into PRSs So I have very small knowledge about how everything works
I tried to take a look at some RS files yesterday, I logged in etc.
I was into Tibia OTS developing tho. IDK if anyone have heard about tibia before. Which is totally different. 2D gaming.
Coding via LUA and C+/++ PHP etc.
So I need someone to guide me somehow.
I have a lot of questions haha, Cuz this seems very different!
If it&#39;s fine with anyone to add on skype so I can ask etc?
bec the tutorials etc are very bad written and doesn&#39;t include basics things u know

Skype: Amir.Amoore</description>
