    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-an-experienced-coder-developer/529186</link>
    <description>Hello guys, I am 1827, Some of you may know who i am and most of you wont, I started coding RSPS about 3 1/2 years ago and the projects that i have worked on before i thought were actually pretty good for someone who hasn&#39;t been in the coding world that long. I have also been a Co-Owner/Developer for several big name servers, If you are looking for an Experienced Developer for Either Client/Source or both. I Mainly work with 317&#39;s/ 508&#39;s. If you are interested in my help, There will be no payment that i ask, This is simply Trying to get back into coding and Hopefully running/Co running Something in the future. If you are interested Please Email me at- Mod-dean@hotmail.com. Or post back On this thread and we can talk. 

Best Regards,

1827.</description>
