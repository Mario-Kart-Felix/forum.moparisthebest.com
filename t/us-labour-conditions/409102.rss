<p>Not saying that its easy, but I could definitely make 20 hours at 9 dollars work without help from my parents. Currently my monthly housing is $220 dollars to rent a room in a house and this gives me access to shower/toliet, washer/dryer, and a shared kitchen. Now 20<em>9</em>4 is $720 a month without taxes so I can easily make rent. I bike to school during good weather and take public transportation during bad weather, this saves me alot of money so theres not much spent getting to work and school. The rest is basically for food and other emergency expenditures. Its easy to budget and make the best use of your money. Its the people that think they can just swipe their nice plastic credit card and buy whatever they want are the ones who cant make it, if you only buy necessities you can at least make ends meet. Now I don’t have to do this because my parents are paying for everything so my paycheck is just going into my savings account and cycled through two paypal accounts and a credit card to increase my score. How this works Paypal Account 1 &gt; Donate to Paypal Account 2 using credit card (pay credit card with checking account&gt;Paypal Account 2 transfer money to savings account &gt; savings account transfer to checking account. Easy way to increase credit score by cycling money through paypal accounts ( I usually cycle about a fourth of my credit card limit each month).<br>
[/quote]Credit cards are evil, i don’t see the addiction americans seem to have to them. I’d never ever buy something on credit.[/quote]<br>
Idiots here use credit cards because it allows them to buy anything they want even if they will never have the money to pay for it. The credit card companies love to drag the susceptible American into using the card by offering no interest for X amount of months then after those months are up they attack that debt which usually in the thousands with interest rates around 20% compounded monthly. This is why America is fucked up, people living beyond their means and debt up to their fucking necks that they will never get out of. I never used a credit card to avoid the temptation of buying something I cant pay for, I would always use a debit card to pull it directly from my bank but I knew once I got out of college and got a real job I would need a house and that would require having a good credit score to get good interest rates on a loan, so thats why I took out a credit card.</p>
<p>Basically a credit score is a score that tells how well you can avoid to buy every fucking thing in sight.</p>

<p>Btw, I probably don’t even agree myself that it should be 90%. Nor should tax be eliminated for lower and middle class.</p>
<p>But when you consider the top 1% have more money then the bottom 95% combined, maybe we could look to them for some more tax money. Also it’s not just the CEO who gets rich in a big company, the shareholders too. Lets tax more from their dividends.</p>
<p>In my opinion, americans should be revolting. They should get their money back from the wall street giants that screwed them all over.</p>

<p>Basically personal gain HAS to be in the equation. What we need is to seal all the loop holes to make sure money is getting where it needs to go, instead of bribing lawmakers to place secret loopholes in the laws that corporations can take advantage of. I think everyone in government right now should get a raise, and to coincide with that have their spending/income monitored completely to make sure there are no acts of corruption. Becoming a part of the government should be like becoming a monk, you should sacrifice for the good of the people.</p>

The businessmen try to recruit General Smedley Butler, promising him an army of 500,000, unlimited financial backing and generous media spin control.

You don’t destroy rich people by making them pay more taxes. How much does people pay in taxes in US?<br>
The numbers I found was 10%-35% that sounds way too low for everyone.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>My tax bracket is 22% @ California minimum wage of $8/hr… Should be A LOT lower if I’m at the bare minimum, but its not :s[/quote]<br>
You could remove the taxes from the poorest and it wouldn’t affect the budget too much. But if the labour conditions were good, it would be necessary.</p>
<p>mwiebelhaus: You said it yourself, if your taxes was higher, you would pay your employees less. So if you care so much about your own income, why don’t lower their income already? Why don’t just outsource the jobs so you get some more money in your big money bag.</p>
<p>How to prevent outsourcing? Easy, make it illegal. Force American companies in some sectors to use American workers. Or set a minimum wage of what American companies in some sectors must pay their workers, even if they work in India.</p>
<p>The Western world has become more and more an Oligarchy, why don’t we do anything to stop it?</p>
