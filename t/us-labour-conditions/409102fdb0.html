Not saying that its easy, but I could definitely make 20 hours at 9 dollars work without help from my parents. Currently my monthly housing is $220 dollars to rent a room in a house and this gives me access to shower/toliet, washer/dryer, and a shared kitchen. Now 20<em>9</em>4 is $720 a month without taxes so I can easily make rent. I bike to school during good weather and take public transportation during bad weather, this saves me alot of money so theres not much spent getting to work and school. The rest is basically for food and other emergency expenditures. Its easy to budget and make the best use of your money. Its the people that think they can just swipe their nice plastic credit card and buy whatever they want are the ones who cant make it, if you only buy necessities you can at least make ends meet. Now I don’t have to do this because my parents are paying for everything so my paycheck is just going into my savings account and cycled through two paypal accounts and a credit card to increase my score. How this works Paypal Account 1 &gt; Donate to Paypal Account 2 using credit card (pay credit card with checking account&gt;Paypal Account 2 transfer money to savings account &gt; savings account transfer to checking account. Easy way to increase credit score by cycling money through paypal accounts ( I usually cycle about a fourth of my credit card limit each month).</p>

<p>Oh on a side note I walked into a store at the mall a couple days ago, applied for a job, next day they call and i setup an interview, they interview me, next day they call me and hire me. This is my first job ever…they are paying me 9$/hr and Im working in a clothing store checking people out and folding clothes…and im working 20 hour weeks while being a freshman in college…damn i tell you its really hard to get a job in this country.</p>

<p>What state? I was looking in California for almost 6 months before I actually got one.</p>

<p>Omaha, Nebraska. We have job surpluses here and many restruants are short staffed.</p>

<p>9 dollars an hour 20 hour weeks isn’t enough to survive though. That isn’t enough for a place to live, food to eat, clothes to wear, adequate recreation… If you were a single mom, you’d be paying 9 dollars an hour for a baby sitter while you go to work.</p>
<p>Single people can make means to live. But you have to feel for the families effected by the reccession.</p>
<p>I spent 8 months looking for a job with no luck. Had many interviews but no luck. There were too many skilled people out of work that I had to compete against. But you keep looking hard and it pays off. Now with no experience I’ve got a career, benefits, pension…  most important I enjoy my job a lot.</p>

<p>Not saying that its easy, but I could definitely make 20 hours at 9 dollars work without help from my parents. Currently my monthly housing is $220 dollars to rent a room in a house and this gives me access to shower/toliet, washer/dryer, and a shared kitchen. Now 20<em>9</em>4 is $720 a month without taxes so I can easily make rent. I bike to school during good weather and take public transportation during bad weather, this saves me alot of money so theres not much spent getting to work and school. The rest is basically for food and other emergency expenditures. Its easy to budget and make the best use of your money. Its the people that think they can just swipe their nice plastic credit card and buy whatever they want are the ones who cant make it, if you only buy necessities you can at least make ends meet. Now I don’t have to do this because my parents are paying for everything so my paycheck is just going into my savings account and cycled through two paypal accounts and a credit card to increase my score. How this works Paypal Account 1 &gt; Donate to Paypal Account 2 using credit card (pay credit card with checking account&gt;Paypal Account 2 transfer money to savings account &gt; savings account transfer to checking account. Easy way to increase credit score by cycling money through paypal accounts ( I usually cycle about a fourth of my credit card limit each month).<br>
[/quote]Credit cards are evil, i don’t see the addiction americans seem to have to them. I’d never ever buy something on credit.[/quote]<br>
Idiots here use credit cards because it allows them to buy anything they want even if they will never have the money to pay for it. The credit card companies love to drag the susceptible American into using the card by offering no interest for X amount of months then after those months are up they attack that debt which usually in the thousands with interest rates around 20% compounded monthly. This is why America is fucked up, people living beyond their means and debt up to their fucking necks that they will never get out of. I never used a credit card to avoid the temptation of buying something I cant pay for, I would always use a debit card to pull it directly from my bank but I knew once I got out of college and got a real job I would need a house and that would require having a good credit score to get good interest rates on a loan, so thats why I took out a credit card.</p>
<p>Basically a credit score is a score that tells how well you can avoid to buy every fucking thing in sight.</p>
