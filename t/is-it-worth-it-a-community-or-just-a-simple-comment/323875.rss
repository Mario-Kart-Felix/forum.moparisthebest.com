    <description>[~ANNOUNCEMENT~] If not in right section please move to the right section.

It has come to my attention that there is alot of what could we call it.  Unneeded comments, unecessary perhaps? Examples Below.  You may probably think this is not a necessary thread,but this is important to me, and maybe other members.  So please do not flame. As I was saying.  Maybe as a whole community we can stop the comments or flaming or simply just get the ones who do it one by one.  If by some reason you dont believe me look below for proof.  Thank you for reading.
