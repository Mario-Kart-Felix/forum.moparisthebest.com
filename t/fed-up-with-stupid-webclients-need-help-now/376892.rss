    <description>Ok im fucking fed up now ive tried for 2 days straight hours and hours trying to get a poxy webclient to work and it doesnt!

Ive signed it all and done, the client work when i open up client.jar so ive done it right!

but when I put it on html and then on the internet it doesnt loads i get many different errors at deifferent times

1. cannot find client.class (bullshit)
2. Connection error (also bullshit)

Its mucked up.

As well as that no one helps you or replies of these forums its pointless.</description>
