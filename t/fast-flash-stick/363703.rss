    <title>Fast flash stick?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fast-flash-stick/363703</link>
    <description>So for my web authoring module at uni we need to set up xampp on a usb flash drive. The teacher told us we all need to buy the fastest one we could find. I thought I&#39;d stick with my current one. Turns out the best speeds I can get is about 3mb/s which seems pretty poor considering when I tried to delete a 200mb file it gave me an estimated time of 40 minutes. When I looked around some retail websites (ebuyer/scan/novatech) I could only see the speeds advertised at something like 300mb/s read and write which seems a bit much.

So how can I find a stick that doesn&#39;t suck?</description>

<p>Yah but all the websites I was looking at weren’t giving me read/write speeds that sounded plausible (something like 200mb write or something). I went with this one in the end:</p>

Turns out the best speeds I can get is about 3mb/s which seems pretty poor considering when I tried to delete a 200mb file it gave me an estimated time of 40 minutes. When I looked around some retail websites (ebuyer/scan/novatech) I could only see the speeds advertised at something like 300mb/s read and write which seems a bit much.</p>
<p>So how can I find a stick that doesn’t suck?</p>
