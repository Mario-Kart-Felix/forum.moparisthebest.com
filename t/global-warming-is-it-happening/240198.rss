    <title>Global Warming - Is it happening?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/global-warming-is-it-happening/240198</link>
    <description>This is probably the biggest of all problems in the world.  There are so many things going on in the world going on right now to prove it, however some people still are are unconvinced.  There are numerous problems that will start to make themselves more clear and easy to see as we near the year 2050.  Some of these problems will involve:


[ul][li]Glaciers all around the world melting[/li]
[li]Storm #&#39;s increase[/li]
[li]3-5 degree warming[/li]
[li]Raise of Co2 levels[/li][/ul]


These are only some of the problems that will occur.  These changes are so obvious at this present moment, that if you can&#39;t see them, you&#39;re either stupid, or lying.  This is the problem with politicians.  For example, Stephen Harper (current president of Canada), says we should stay on course with what we are doing, as the Earth is just going through changes, it has before, and it&#39;s just nature at it&#39;s best.  This is simply impossible.  I believe this theory is best proved wrong by this picture.  It shows Co2 levels and temperature over the last 650 000 years.  Notice how they plot the same course?  Harper believes that the Earth is just going through it&#39;s normal change; up and down every few hundred years.  This is not the case on this particular occasion.  The Co2 of today is shown as the yellow dot on the chart, which is much higher then it should be, and higher then it ever has been.  The highest Co2 record was passed in the 1970&#39;s, but still did not plummet.  This was the first sign of global warming.

The number of storms, and severity of storms has gone up.  In 2004, the number of tornadoes that touched down in the United States was 1717, which is insanely high.  Additionally, we&#39;re all aware of the hurricanes that took place around this time period (dennis, katrina, etc) which was another sign of global warming occurring.  This is caused by ocean warming.

Glaciers around the world are melting due to the warming that is occurring.  The water from the glacier&#39;s don&#39;t just disappear.  The glacier&#39;s are retreating at an alarming rate, which is causing the ocean levels to go up, due to the amount of water these glaciers produce.  For places that are at sea level, or already below sea level (such as New Orleans) are in serious trouble.  40% of the marshlands in the United States are located in Louisiana.  These marshlands are quickly disappearing, at the alarming rate of 100 acres/day.  This is a serious problem, and this is not the only place in danger.  15 of the world&#39;s largest cities are on coastlines, which could leave millions of people homeless, and could move the coastline in several km.

This 3-5 degree warming may not seem like a lot, but just think about it a different way.  If you live in a place where the temperature range isn&#39;t that large, then you are looking at a serious increase in temperature.  For example, if you have a city where the temperature range is 10 degrees - 30 degrees, your temperature range is 20.  If you increase your temperatures by 3-5 degrees, you have increased your temperature by 15-25% increase.  That&#39;s quite a lot, and for places like Florida, it could even be more then that.  Additionally, for every 1 degree increase in temperature, you must increase the rainfall by 10% to accommodate for proper plant/crop growth, or anything like that.  This mainly affects places where lots of crops are grown, because this could severely impact food production, and leave people starving. 

So, is it happening?</description>
