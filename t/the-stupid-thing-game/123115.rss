    <title>The &#39;Stupid Thing&#39; Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-stupid-thing-game/123115</link>
    <description>Hello,
inspired by the work of the First Version of Runescape in a batch file by LeScape Pk,
I made this text based game too.It&#39;s something like his version but of course different.

Don&#39;t look at the code, it spoils the fun.

[b]Step 1 : [/b]Make a batch file

[b]Step 2 : [/b]Copy this code into it

echo Jagex Ltd had done with the game, he was shocked. Jagex had developed an 
echo entire new game with the idea, RuneScape Classic! Le was shocked
echo by the huge success, and was mad for selling the idea; but once the 
echo RuneScape we all Know and love came out, RuneScape 2, Le was furious with  
echo himself for selling the first version of RuneScape developed by Le Ltd. 
echo Le had put so much work into it, only to find it could have been a huge 
echo success with a little developement, and he could have been making millions  
echo of dollars with all the the $5 paying addicts. Le was so furious, that
echo he set off to overcome Jagex Ltd and make a new RuneScape, a better

echo is a male pretending to be a female, so watch out. Also, females can 
echo be very dangerous, known to have hit 90's with the lengendary bitch 
echo slap. They can also suck you dry quicker than a noob in Lumbridge 
echo when you're wearing full dragon. Your secondary goals are to avoid said 
echo noobs, as they will stick to you like a bad germ, and to become the 
echo strongest in the game, making wise choices and actually playing the game. 
echo Good luck.

echo gold as you can from the pockets of males. Males will be warned of females,

echo suspicious of you. Your secondary goals are to look as "prettifull" and
echo "seksi" as you possibly can, and buy items for their looks instead
echo of their bonuses. Good luck.
