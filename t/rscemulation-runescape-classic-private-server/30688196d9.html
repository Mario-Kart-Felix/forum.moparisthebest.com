        <p>[quote=‚ÄúKryptix, post:771, topic:307209‚Äù]If I could be bothered I‚Äôd go through 18 months of IRC/MSN chat logs to find all the messages from Research saying not to worry and so on. If he wanted them it wouldn‚Äôt have taken him over a year to ask. Instead he saw an opportunity to try and make me look bad and went with it; he doesn‚Äôt even play and has no interest in the subscription. If I had anything to hide I simply wouldn‚Äôt have responded to him. If you frequent RSCEmulation‚Äôs forum you will have seen him post numerous times speaking negatively about the server and flaming me whenever possible, he‚Äôs only doing this to try and harm myself/RSCEmulation so let him have his fun. The fact is that he <span class="bbcode-b">donated</span> prior to subscriptions being released, as a good will gesture I offered him a (single) subscription when they were released but as you can see this is the first time it‚Äôs been mentioned (over a year later) and as I said above he‚Äôs only doing this to create drama. He knew I would say no, in fact he wanted me to say no and I played right into his hands by doing so.</p>

<p>If by killed RSC you mean run a reliable, secure and stable RSC private server for the last year and a half then yeah I guess you‚Äôre right. I find it amusing that someone who has regularly released infected clients and ran countless servers that shut down out of the blue leaving players with no choice but to start all over again on another server or quit RSC entirely due to loosing faith in the private server scene claims I killed RSC.</p>

<p>Please lets at least get our information straight. If you gave two shits about anything but the money being generated from your server you could take a quick look and see that my IP is logged in quite frequently and I play a lot. Our IRC chat logs prove that you knew what you said way back then so I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôd need to go through logs to find what you said? Also, despite the fact that I can‚Äôt prove it I was told that when a price was figured out for subs I would be given as many as $40 would pay for, not one. Like I‚Äôve said before people can believe who they want but I haven‚Äôt come here to start a flame war, just to have people see that you truly don‚Äôt give a fuck about anything but the money.</p>
<p>Edit: As for making you look bad, yeah that is obviously what I‚Äôm trying to do as you‚Äôre now jewing me out of subs which I was told I‚Äôd be given. However, I don‚Äôt need to succeed in making you look bad because with the way things are going you‚Äôll give plenty of other people the same opportunity.</p>
<p>By the way, reading the second part of your post not necessarily directed towards me has prompted this response. You wouldn‚Äôt get near the amount of shit you do now if you didn‚Äôt let so many people down. Yeah you have the longest running most popular RSC private server out there(because of player count), great! But you‚Äôve let it slip so far from where you started aside from the increase in players, I‚Äôm talking about the dedication. I remember when RSCE was first released and you said ALL of the money donated would go towards the server and you wouldn‚Äôt profit from it. Obviously with the amount of money subs generate now its acceptable that you would make money as this does (or did) take up your time. The reason people hate you is because now that you make the money and have the people who will sit there and pay you no matter what happens with the server you simply don‚Äôt give a fuck about it. How long were people not getting their subs for yet I‚Äôm sure there was no delay in their payment to you? How many polls have happened that have sat there with stacked results but changes haven‚Äôt been implemented? It takes people forever to reach you, you don‚Äôt appreciate those who got the server to where they are, and its all about the money which has given you ample opportunity to ‚Äúhave a life‚Äù. If you recall you used to sit here and engage in an internet war with people here quite often.</p>

<p>You can at least admit that you were wrong about me not playing. Am I willing to deal with not having the subs? Sure, not gonna lose sleep over it. Tbh I‚Äôm actually happier to see that you‚Äôre more active on the forums and in-game and wanting to see what peoples opinions are on updates.</p>

If I could be bothered I‚Äôd go through 18 months of IRC/MSN chat logs to find all the messages from Research saying not to worry and so on. If he wanted them it wouldn‚Äôt have taken him over a year to ask. Instead he saw an opportunity to try and make me look bad and went with it; he doesn‚Äôt even play and has no interest in the subscription. If I had anything to hide I simply wouldn‚Äôt have responded to him. If you frequent RSCEmulation‚Äôs forum you will have seen him post numerous times speaking negatively about the server and flaming me whenever possible, he‚Äôs only doing this to try and harm myself/RSCEmulation so let him have his fun. The fact is that he <span class="bbcode-b">donated</span> prior to subscriptions being released, as a good will gesture I offered him a (single) subscription when they were released but as you can see this is the first time it‚Äôs been mentioned (over a year later) and as I said above he‚Äôs only doing this to create drama. He knew I would say no, in fact he wanted me to say no and I played right into his hands by doing so.</p>

<p>Please lets at least get our information straight. If you gave two shits about anything but the money being generated from your server you could take a quick look and see that my IP is logged in quite frequently and I play a lot. Our IRC chat logs prove that you knew what you said way back then so I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôd need to go through logs to find what you said? Also, despite the fact that I can‚Äôt prove it I was told that when a price was figured out for subs I would be given as many as $40 would pay for, not one. Like I‚Äôve said before people can believe who they want but I haven‚Äôt come here to start a flame war, just to have people see that you truly don‚Äôt give a fuck about anything but the money.</p>
<p>Edit: As for making you look bad, yeah that is obviously what I‚Äôm trying to do as you‚Äôre now jewing me out of subs which I was told I‚Äôd be given. However, I don‚Äôt need to succeed in making you look bad because with the way things are going you‚Äôll give plenty of other people the same opportunity.</p>
<p>By the way, reading the second part of your post not necessarily directed towards me has prompted this response. You wouldn‚Äôt get near the amount of shit you do now if you didn‚Äôt let so many people down. Yeah you have the longest running most popular RSC private server out there(because of player count), great! But you‚Äôve let it slip so far from where you started aside from the increase in players, I‚Äôm talking about the dedication. I remember when RSCE was first released and you said ALL of the money donated would go towards the server and you wouldn‚Äôt profit from it. Obviously with the amount of money subs generate now its acceptable that you would make money as this does (or did) take up your time. The reason people hate you is because now that you make the money and have the people who will sit there and pay you no matter what happens with the server you simply don‚Äôt give a fuck about it. How long were people not getting their subs for yet I‚Äôm sure there was no delay in their payment to you? How many polls have happened that have sat there with stacked results but changes haven‚Äôt been implemented? It takes people forever to reach you, you don‚Äôt appreciate those who got the server to where they are, and its all about the money which has given you ample opportunity to ‚Äúhave a life‚Äù. If you recall you used to sit here and engage in an internet war with people here quite often.</p>
