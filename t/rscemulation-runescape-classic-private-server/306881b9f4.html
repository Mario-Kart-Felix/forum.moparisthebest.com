Once you’ve been around as long as I have you’ll realize that happiness from things like religion and love is only temporary, and is quickly turned into misery.[/quote]Your constant air of omnipotence is extremely aggravating.

<p>Also, it’s not just my ‘thoughts and experiences’.  I’ve spent a considerable amount of time making observations, comparing my observations to others, reading up on it, analyzing the ‘data’, and putting the pieces together.  Everything points to happiness coming from within, and being secure with your situation in life.  Could I be wrong?  Sure, but I’ve seen absolutely nothing to support that, and an overwhelming amount of ‘evidence’ that contradicts happiness coming from things like religion.</p>

        <p>Again you stamp your view onto something else, what you think is unhappy could be perfectly happy to someone else. It’s up to the person to decide, <span class="bbcode-u">not you</span>. I understand a feeling of control and complete understanding is what keeps <span class="bbcode-i">you</span> happy, but could you try to tone it down a bit when you’re trying to convince someone else <span class="bbcode-i">they</span> aren’t happy? It’s depressing.</p>
<p>EDIT - And I agree with Pompano. You read into human emotion like it’s straightforward, mundane, and easy to comprehend for each person. It isn’t, which is why psychology is such an intensive profession. You need to learn everyone personally before you can make the type of conclusions you do.</p>

You are a Mr know it all and I honestly feel sorry for you because it sounds like you have a very sad and lonely life.[/quote]I don’t think I’m better than everyone…  There are several people that I will readily admit are better than me at certain things.  For example, super_ is a far better programmer than I am, Kryptix is far better at front-end web design than I am, etc.  It’s you that think I am a ‘know it all’, not me.</p>
<p>Also, why would I frequent a place where I have the same opinion as everyone else?  That would make for a discussion-less, and boring place.  In addition, it wouldn’t provoke thought, be remotely beneficial, or promote personal growth.</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:1628, topic:306881”]Again you stamp your view onto something else, what you think is unhappy could be perfectly happy to someone else. It’s up to the person to decide, <span class="bbcode-u">not you</span>. I understand a feeling of control and complete understanding is what keeps <span class="bbcode-i">you</span> happy, but could you try to tone it down a bit when you’re trying to convince someone else <span class="bbcode-i">they</span> aren’t happy? It’s depressing.</p>
<p>EDIT - And I agree with Pompano. You read into human emotion like it’s straightforward, mundane, and easy to comprehend for each person. It isn’t, which is why psychology is such an intensive profession. You need to learn everyone personally before you can make the type of conclusions you do.[/quote]You’re right, there is absolutely no way I can know if someone who looks and is miserable when you actually talk to them is actually miserable, especially seeing they’re trying to hide it…  You obviously haven’t had much experience with this sort of thing.  Maybe you should get some more practice before you make naive statements based on your own inabilities.</p>
<p>It is straightforward when you’ve actually had practice…  It’s not hard to spot someone who is miserable when you look right at their face and talk to them about anything important to them.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wish you the best in learning how to ‘read’ people, interpret/recognize paralanguage, and figuring out where happiness comes from.</p>

        <p>Your arrogance is intoxicating. Assuming that everyone communicates or expresses the same feelings with their body language or language is just… stupid, for lack of a better term. Sure, there are some sure-fire ways to determine certain things. But determine the cause of someones unhappiness, or to assume for sure they are unhappy (“I’m always this way”) is outrageous because it’s relative to each person just what happiness is.</p>
<p>I’m done with this argument. And, though you probably could already tell, I’m happy about that! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Wouldn’t religion be the root of all evil? Religion is after all the leading cause of murder. Not to mention corruption, ambition, and anti homosexuality. [/quote]<br>

<p>[quote]With todays standard of life you own a piece of paper with a few doodles on it and a nice number it allows you to purchase something in return that will make you happy.

It also can counter and be the opposite way, keeping people from being happy.[/quote] Your are mistaking happiness with pleasure but i don’t blame you, it is the effects of the consumerism culture.</p>

<blockquote>Help everyone in need and staying away from bad stuff.</blockquote> Really contradicting statement so I won't even bother with that one.
<blockquote>Your are mistaking happiness with pleasure but i don't blame you, it is the effects of the consumerism culture.</blockquote>
No, there is no mistake between happiness and pleasure as I wrote about the [i]ability[/i] to be happy based on pleasure (as you say). Which I was not thinking about the pleasure side at all but instead including it. More of a supporting argument. 
<blockquote>I know this... the island where i live is owned by the USA and also i can see how the young keep killing each other when dealing with drug traffic, trying to get the happiness you talk about (having lost the dignity and self respect that work gives). </blockquote>
<p>drug traffic is a totally different subject in its own. Everybody knows the risk involved in it and everybody has the choice to choose whether to participate.</p>
<p>Please come up with some valid arguments and support.</p>
<p>Since your so into religion… do you think “god” is a male or female?</p>

<p>It is pretty sad how you think you are better than everyone on this forum. You are the one sitting at your computer arguing constantly with everyone on here. I honestly do not understand why you enjoy chatting on this forum if you continue to disagree with everyone’s opinion. You are a Mr know it all and I honestly feel sorry for you because it sounds like you have a very sad and lonely life.<br>
[/quote]I don’t think I’m better than everyone…  There are several people that I will readily admit are better than me at certain things.  For example, super_ is a far better programmer than I am, Kryptix is far better at front-end web design than I am, etc.  It’s you that think I am a ‘know it all’, not me.<br>
[/quote]lol simmer down, obviously a knowitall wouldnt admit they are a knowitall<br>
[/quote]Or they’re actually intelligent enough to recognize what their strengths and weaknesses are, and just play to their strengths.</p>

<p>and by playing these strengths they expose their weakness of interpersonal communication and thus have no friends. sit[/quote]Wrong again.</p>
