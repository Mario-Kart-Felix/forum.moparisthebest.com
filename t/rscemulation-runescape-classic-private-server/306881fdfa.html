</aside>
<p>No…I was further proving your point. We already established that Luke is a hypocrite blah blah blah Matt did the same shit himself, but why do you think he wants to keep his players? He wants money. They both do. You were a pawn, it really doesn’t matter which side you take, or who’s more of a bad guy, the end of the day, they both want more people on their servers to generate their income. It’s called seeing the bigger picture in all this.</p>

        <p>I don’t want to be personally pleased as a player Luke, I want you to be unbiased as an admin. Also I’m prepared to post screenshots of my inability to access your game and forums as its really funny that as soon as I saw you online on mopar I was able to access your forums, interesting coincidence. I seriously almost fell on the floor laughing as I read your post and noticed I was unbanned. My ISP takes time to update? Funny how earlier today prior to me being unable to access your forums and game I was ABLE to get on the forums AFTER you switched the server seeing as I read the post under News &amp; Announcements about Being on the New Server.</p>
<p>Ah about your reasoning for having secureport possibly flag me for something, I have spam refreshed a topic on RSCE before and I was banned from accessing the site… for 30 seconds. Today I did nothing of the sort and out of the blue I was unable to access the site or game.</p>
<p>I was not picked the same way your new staff were, I played for a least 2 weeks and I was on EVERY SINGLE DAY for many hours during the day, in fact re-reading the forums after I was picked about your picking new staff topic I stumbled upon the fact that the main reason I was picked was my ability to be extremely active. You needed me and I was the most qualified person at the time, plenty of qualified people have apped since then and yet you pick the people you knew from other servers who as far as I know, never apped at all. Do they even have accounts they play on?</p>
<p>About me asking for my mod powers back, I never did so seriously. I was jokingly asking for mod the entire time up until the one night I told you that I was going to quit again, I didn’t give you all of the reasons but you raged at me because you thought I’d quit due to losing 3m in a stake to matt, talked on about how you were so happy that you chose not to give me mod back.</p>
<p>I never stated you were in this for the money, I stated that you broke a rule that YOU made and were so adamant on keeping upheld as far as I was aware.</p>
<p>Again, I am not in the slightest suprised that you did this, anything to defend yourself and keep your image untarnished in the eyes of your players who you so desperately do not want to lose.</p>
<p>And finally, why did you fail to address the fact that you took down Matts server on the first night it was up, and the whole bowtech situation?</p>
<p>Anyways Luke if you’re going to try and defend yourself this time I’ll just post the pics and be done with it, I don’t want to argue I just want people to see that you’re turning out to be no better of an admin then Matt previously was.</p>
<p>And again, I never wanted to become involved in any of this RSC P server drama but seeing you act so victimized and appalled by accusations of bringing Matt’s server down and then finally me being IP’d just pushed me over the edge.</p>
<p>Edit Again: I’m suprised I forgot to mention the 5 screenshots of people being racist in mage bank (which the same people have also done in say) in which despite them disobeying the CLEARLY LAYED OUT RULES nothing was done.</p>

        <blockquote>Regarding Project P2P, in all honesty, I couldn't care less. I had fun whilst I played Project P2P. It was nice being able to train to any stats I wanted in next to no time, and I can see the appeal but Matt has ruined that for hundreds and thousands of people. Logan (123Jal) messaged me on MSN last night telling me a few home truths about Matt and how he currently runs Project P2P, which I found quite funny. Matt gave him all the supplies needed for 99 Smithing so he'd play, as well as ALLOWING him to auto. One of the moderators (Jesse) caught him, but Matt told him to let Logan go. Of course, it's not up to me how Matt chooses to run Project P2P but it makes sense how he's gained a lot of players back. The same was offered to a few other people I have on my list (as well as play RSCEmulation). I'm sure you're already aware, but a large percentage of the RSC community will be persuaded by items and stats, hence why all these random PK servers manage to convince lots of people across.</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don’t let him auto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I gave him 99 smithing because he re-joined PP2P. he brought in a few people for me, so I gave him it. I only did it for like another person and that was it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn your facts before you start talking bullshit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>–</p>
<p>EDIT - By the way, Don’t even bring up PP2P Luke, you’ve done enough to it, making up bullshit stories, trying to get people to come up to me and make me say shit so you can get me banned on Mopar. You say I am bad, You should take a look at yourself.</p>

<p>lol, My favourite part about this whole sentence, is… that’s a lie. Remember when you tried to make up a bullshit story in my thread, about me DDoSing you or whatever? Well Vivek showed me a picture you showed him, you diddling around in secure port.</p>
<p>I thought you didn’t know how it works?</p>

        <p>My quoting skills fail horribly, R is me L is luke <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>R: I don’t want to be personally pleased as a player Luke, I want you to be unbiased as an admin. Also I’m prepared to post screenshots of my inability to access your game and forums as its really funny that as soon as I saw you online on mopar I was able to access your forums, interesting coincidence. I seriously almost fell on the floor laughing as I read your post and noticed I was unbanned. My ISP takes time to update? Funny how earlier today prior to me being unable to access your forums and game I was ABLE to get on the forums AFTER you switched the server seeing as I read the post under News &amp; Announcements about Being on the New Server.</p>
<p>L: Well, on my familys life Research, you were NOT banned. As I said in my post, if SecurePort flagged you it could take an hour for it to expire. Staminus don’t reveal much about SecurePort so I’m not entirely sure how it works, but I have a rough idea. Believe me, if I ban someone I have a good reason for doing so.</p>
<p>R: Luke, you aren’t a dumb guy, and I trust you don’t take me for one. Why would you visibly ban me with no good reason? Its easy enough to go and IP me through the system so I still can’t play, I’m well aware that my accounts function but if I can’t get on your website or game I doubt that matters. You apparently ignored the part of my post where I stated that I was able to access the forums after your server change but then a few hours later, and for more than an hour, up until you read my post on mopar incidentally I wasn’t able to access the forums or server.</p>
<p>R: Ah about your reasoning for having secureport possibly flag me for something, I have spam refreshed a topic on RSCE before and I was banned from accessing the site… for 30 seconds. Today I did nothing of the sort and out of the blue I was unable to access the site or game.<br>
That wasn’t SecurePort. The HTTP block was a Apache mod that we removed when we purchased SecurePort.</p>
<p>L: I honestly don’t know why you weren’t able to access the IP address, but you were not manually banned. Do you really think I’d block your IP address but leave your forum account as well as your in-game characters active and un-banned? We’ve had a few people having DNS issues.</p>
<p>R: Please explain to me how I was unbanned if you claim I was “never banned”. Again refer to my above post for your response on the DNS issues.</p>
<p>R: I was not picked the same way your new staff were, I played for a least 2 weeks and I was on EVERY SINGLE DAY for many hours during the day, in fact re-reading the forums after I was picked about your picking new staff topic I stumbled upon the fact that the main reason I was picked was my ability to be extremely active. You needed me and I was the most qualified person at the time, plenty of qualified people have apped since then and yet you pick the people you knew from other servers who as far as I know, never apped at all. Do they even have accounts they play on?</p>
<p>L: I’m not sure who exactly you’re talking about, but if you read the above post you’ll find a user complaining that I moderate people I don’t actually know. The only person who’s a moderator that I knew before RSCEmulation is Mod Tina. She moved over to RSCEmulation bringing 20+ friends with her, showed a lot of dedication and like yourself, was extremely active. It made sense, and I have no regrets – she’s a fantastic moderator. I’ve just looked through the staff list and there’s NO-ONE on there (except Mod Tina) that I knew before RSCEmulation. Not even our new administrator, Zilent.</p>
<p>R: By admitting that you didn’t know them prior to RSCE there is absolutely no reason you should’ve modded any of them, stating this would mean you have clearly no experience with that person whatsoever and you’re giving them some type of power over your server, I will give you the fact that none of them have abused or done a bad job but it was still the wrong way to pick mods.</p>
<p>R: About me asking for my mod powers back, I never did so seriously. I was jokingly asking for mod the entire time up until the one night I told you that I was going to quit again, I didn’t give you all of the reasons but you raged at me because you thought I’d quit due to losing 3m in a stake to matt, talked on about how you were so happy that you chose not to give me mod back.</p>
<p>L: That’s very easy to say now, but I distinctly remember you asking me more than once. You ever changed your Ventrilo comment to “Luke mode me!” (or something along those lines). I have no-idea why you’re denying it now… It’s nothing bad. You said yourself the only reason you decided to post this is because you <span class="bbcode-i">thought</span> you were banned. If you did read through the thread I posted regarding the new server you would have seen that I too had DNS issues and I couldn’t get in-game for a few hours after the switch.</p>
<p>R: I’m not saying that now because I’m angry, I’m saying it because it was the truth. If you had noticed what I did towards the end of my playing on RSCE I was not a very helpful person and in fact I enjoyed getting a rise out of people in ::say. I will admit that during the day before I had quit was the ONE time I was serious about getting mod back, all the others were actually jokes.</p>
<p>R: I never stated you were in this for the money, I stated that you broke a rule that YOU made and were so adamant on keeping upheld as far as I was aware.</p>
<p>L: …and I haven’t. As I said, I turn down sooo many offers every-single-day. He didn’t expect anything in return what-so-ever, and it was actually a few days later I offered him the Party Hat as it suddenly ticked that without him RSCEmulation probably wouldn’t even be online. You should know this all too well. You donated 40$, did you get any items in return? No. I’d love to reward players who donate but unfortunately we’ve all seen how economies turn out when that happens which is why I’ve taken a different approach.</p>
<p>R: It makes no sense to give him a hat when he agreed to donate for nothing other than a subscription. I find it extremely hard to believe that after not wanting to ruin the economy whatsoever AFTER he donated to you, you CHOSE to give him a hat.</p>
<p>R: Again, I am not in the slightest suprised that you did this, anything to defend yourself and keep your image untarnished in the eyes of your players who you so desperately do not want to lose.</p>
<p>L: I’ve got nothing to hide, I’ve just explained everything I can. Of course I don’t want to loose players, I’ve put a LOT of time, effort and money into this project and I don’t want to let the players down. A server without players isn’t much fun at all.[/quote]</p>
<p>R: This is pretty much over and done with people can choose who they want to believe.</p>
<p>R: And finally, why did you fail to address the fact that you took down Matts server on the first night it was up, and the whole bowtech situation?</p>
<p>L: Did you read my post? I said I could defend myself all night but I said I’d reply to a few points. Anyway, originally when the exploit came to light (to Matt anyway), Vivek showed me the screenshot and that’s the first I knew of Project P2P being took down. It came to my attention pretty quickly who was doing this, and as I’ve been IP banned from the start of Project P2P I haven’t been able to keep up with Matt’s progress. I have to admit, I found it all pretty humorous when people were pasting me posts that Matt had written, but I’m certainly not the one taking it down.</p>
<p>Regarding Bowtech, a few people have spoken to me about him but they have no proof. It’s merely being suspicious of him. I’m not going to ban someone because you <span class="bbcode-i">think</span> he’s autoing. We’re very close to releasing our new client which will include lots of new detection methods, including the ability to remotely lock a players keyboard and mouse to see if they’re actually controlling the character them self. We will also be able to check the players internal IP, as well as their MAC address so we can be 100% positive that they’re actually the same person. If I can’t prove that someone is breaking a rule I won’t ban them, no matter how many people moan and complain. We’re doing our best to detect rule breakers and ban many every-single-day.</p>
<p>R: This is the reason I posted again and the reason that I know you’ll do anything to keep your reputation, I wish to god I had saved the MSN logs of you admitting to me that you were the one bringing p2p down because now I regret not having the proof.</p>
<p>As for the whole bowtech issue, yeah I want him banned for autoing but was I asking you to look into it because I personally wanted him banned? No. Shark told me he caught him autoing twice, this wasn’t people being suspicious this was him being caught BY A MOD. He was flagged and banned by nut for being on a modified client and you told me he showed you what caused that to happen but you never went any further into it. He is now unbanned and happily playing, I’d say 3 times was enough to not allow him to come back with no consequences but a 2 hour temp ban.</p>
<p>R: Anyways Luke if you’re going to try and defend yourself this time I’ll just post the pics and be done with it, I don’t want to argue I just want people to see that you’re turning out to be no better of an admin then Matt previously was.</p>
<p>L: Who wouldn’t defend their self? You know full well I run RSCEmulation well, hence why you’ve been one of our longest players. You’ve obviously got upset about a few things but that will happen on any server, believe me on that one. I do my utmost to keep everyone happy whilst still enforcing rules. It’s not easy.</p>
<p>R: I guess you would defend yourself seeing as its just my word vs. yours, however, many of the RSCE players know me very well and should believe that I have no reason to make any of this up and I’m only posting it because it needs to be said.</p>
<p>R: And again, I never wanted to become involved in any of this RSC P server drama but seeing you act so victimized and appalled by accusations of bringing Matt’s server down and then finally me being IP’d just pushed me over the edge.</p>
<p>L: As I said, I haven’t banned you. I didn’t ban you. No-one has banned you. If you had taken the time to proxy you would have seen that your account was still perfectly accessible, un-touched and un-banned.</p>
<p>R: Again, refer to my above post. Why ban me with no good reason and make yourself look like you’re running this server with your emotions for banning me because I sided with Matt? You could easily just IP me and before I even read your post I was chatting with Matt on MSN and I told him exactly what you’d say, guess what? I was right. As for me now being able to access the site, hell I’d do the same if I was you, I wouldn’t want people looking at me in such a negative light for banning one of my previously most dedicated players for having an opinion that I didn’t like.</p>
<p>R: Edit Again: I’m suprised I forgot to mention the 5 screenshots of people being racist in mage bank (which the same people have also done in say) in which despite them disobeying the CLEARLY LAYED OUT RULES nothing was done.</p>
<p>L: Maybe you don’t notice things being done, but if a moderator sees anything overly abusive or racist they will receive a temporarily Global Chat mute. If it continues they will have the privilege taken away completely. It’s not easy monitoring 100-190 online players at once, but I genuinely try my best and I genuinely want the best for the server and its players.</p>
<p>R: They had done it in global before and continued to be able to chat. Of course it isn’t easy to monitor this many people, care to know what is? Reading my Report Players post on the forums which you are on constantly with 5 screenshots showing them all being racist.</p>
<p>That was fun.</p>

Naw I’m not stupid, been using my server for more then a year and a half, I think I know what secureport is. You didn’t get what I was saying exactly… You basically said you had no control over it. I was basically showing that you could have banned research through that, yet your denying it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Wrong again. I cannot ban or block through SecurePort. I cannot see IP’s that are banned or blocked. I cannot see why they were banned or blocked, and I cannot remove banned or blocked IP’s. The screenshot above is actually pretty embarrassing, but someone at Staminus pasted in the IP that was attacking us, thinking it’d block the IP. He actually pasted it into the ‘Block Country’ text box which you can use to block entire countries. I’m sure even you can make sense of the above screenshot.</p>
<p>So yes, Matt, you are stupid.</p>
<p>Once again, feel free to clarify what I’ve just said with anyone who has used SecurePort before.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not really Luke, I rather not go into a debate about secureport, it’s rather annoying and stupid since I don’t use the program.</p>
<p>I had to edit my post because I misunderstood the issue between you and research until I actually read it all. (which is up above)</p>
<p>Anyways, I’ve got better things to do. I told you I wouldn’t go into your little business crap, and here I am going in it. Good luck. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Oh and uh, if you care to still you know… try to prove that I was ddosing your server, go right ahead… <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,403369.140.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,403369.140.html</a></p>

Naw I’m not stupid, been using my server for more then a year and a half, I think I know what secureport is. You didn’t get what I was saying exactly… You basically said you had no control over it. I was basically showing that you could have banned research through that, yet your denying it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Wrong again. I cannot ban or block through SecurePort. I cannot see IP’s that are banned or blocked. I cannot see why they were banned or blocked, and I cannot remove banned or blocked IP’s. The screenshot above is actually pretty embarrassing, but someone at Staminus pasted in the IP that was attacking us, thinking it’d block the IP. He actually pasted it into the ‘Block Country’ text box which you can use to block entire countries. I’m sure even you can make sense of the above screenshot.</p>
<p>So yes, Matt, you are stupid.</p>
<p>Once again, feel free to clarify what I’ve just said with anyone who has used SecurePort before.[/quote]</p>
<p>You can block a IP at Secureport level, it just takes a little bit ingenuity.</p>

Maybe at the level, but not through SecurePort, right? Well, that’s what I’ve been told anyway. I’ve been speaking with John and Toro a lot and they said it’s not currently possible to block individual IP’s through SecurePort. Are they wrong?[/quote]</p>

<p>You say your busy with other people. Funny shit bro, gawdz was standing there fully active watching them flame me because they think it’s funny to call black people “nig*ers”. I was obviously bothered since Gawdz was there and did nothing. Also, if I re-call, you weren’t busy at the time and were informed and nothing happened. Tbh, I hear some things should be happening to certain people. Sources told me. Keeping my mouth shut, what goes around comes around.</p>
<p>And whatever happens, I’m not involved in any scams, private server drama, etc. I just play for fun.[/quote]</p>

<li>No Overly-Abusive or Racist Remarks<br>
Many people find racist jokes/remarks and abusive religious jokes/remarks to be funny or acceptable. This community is built and will grow on the foundation that we are respectful and accepting of every player, regardless of their background. That is why there will be absolutely no racist or overly-abusive remarks allowed. Any of these remarks made towards another player will result in a temporary mute. If it is between two people flaming each other and both are being abusive neither person will be favored, you will both be muted. If you are a repeat offender and have been muted on several occasions already it may lead to a ban. Simply put these overly-abusive comments hurt and will not be taken lightly on RSCEmulation.</li>
</ol>
<p>What was that gawdz? Also you clearly didn’t read my post as it is completely acceptable that you cannot see everything that goes on in chat, but when I post 5 screenshots of racism on the forums, I’m pretty sure its not hard to find.</p>

        <p>[quote=“xa0sluke, post:62, topic:307209”]It’s a difficult rule. If someone is joking around and says “lol u nig”, what are you supposed to do? If you banned and muted for every single offence there wouldn’t be many people on ANY server.</p>
<p>I tend to step in when it starts becoming overly-abusive, “rofl u fucking nigger cunt, go suck ur mums fat arse jew” (etc)</p>
<p>Enforcing rules is incredibly difficult. People moan for you to enforce them, and then when they’re enforced the people involved moan. It’s impossible to do anything right in their eyes. I try my best, but I’ve learnt just to trust my judgement and do what I think is best because there’s no-way in hell anyone can please everyone.[/quote]</p>
<p>Honestly this makes me think you never looked at the screenshots, if I do recall one of the lines was “you fucking retarded nigger” or something close, I was basically posting again because gawdz stated it wasn’t a rule when your forums show clear as day that it is. Funny thing is I also warned them I was taking screenshots and going to post if they continued to spam racism, what did they do? The other 4 screenies can answer that question.</p>
<p>Also you aren’t enforcing rules to please people Luke, you are enforcing them because they are the rules that EVERYONE must abide by. Just because the people who broke the rules don’t like them or are going to complain about it when they break them doesn’t mean you should second guess punishing them.</p>
