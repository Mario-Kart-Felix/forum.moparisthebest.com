I for once agree with CodeForFame here.</p>
<p>Out of respect for Kryptix and because he did not leave any instructions on what to do with this in the event of his death (who would…?), I’m locking this thread.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Since when did we base our actions on rumours?  Did you contact Pyru to verify any of this? Why does he have to contact me, get on team-viewer and show me the Staminus client portal, SSH into the actual box that runs RSCE and ontop of that show me the source files for the server?[/quote]What? I said nothing about Pyru having access to the server, I personally couldn’t care less if he does or not. Read my post in the other thread you deleted (<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,549353.0.html">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,549353.0.html</a>) if you want an explanation (where I even agree that Pyru is the owner)</p>
<p>@ Pyru - Can you make your own advertisement? I still want this topic locked out of respect for Kryptix.</p>

<p>[<a href="http://quote=RSCEmulation.net" rel="nofollow noopener">quote=RSCEmulation.net</a>]Just an update to those who are skeptical on the future of the server. I wanna re-assure you, that RSCEmulation is going no-where, we’re here to stay!  Hosting has been taken care of, thanks to the donations received by Miles and Dayle, along with the subscription purchases by the community. You can continue to do your part, by using ::vote (in-game), purchasing subscriptions and most importantly, playing. Thank you all for continuing to keep RSCEmulation the biggest and longest running Runescape Classic private server ever.</p>
<p>I am also offering a limited time offer, if you purchase 10 subscriptions, you’ll get a free party hat. Not to be confused, it’s the subscription cards, or the party hat. Now, don’t get a head of yourselves, the party hat won’t be “spawned”, but will be taken from a character, that had been previously banned for 2 weeks or more. This means no new items will be introduced in to the economy, I will not be spawning anything. That being said, you cannot request / suggest another kind of rare you want, you’ll get to choose from what party hats are available. As well as purchasing the 10 subscription cards, I’ll also top off your account with 30 days extra subscription time. Now if you don’t care to get a party hat, I will also offer a free subscription card to anyone that purchases 3 or more at a time. Keep in mind this is a limited time offer, so as soon as supplies run out, the offer will no longer stand. The funds raised, will go towards the server, as always.</p>
<p>A side note: I am working on updates, and have been since taking over. Thus far, I have kept the community informed on any changes and updates that occur, I will continue to do so. If you do purchase subscriptions, make sure to PM me via the forums, with your PayPal transaction ID.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

Way to monetize the game…  I feel like this is just a ploy to milk it before it gets dumped at the end of the month.</p>
<p>I’m guessing that Pyru doesn’t have access to the Staminus account or the current source, so he’s going to grab as much money as he can.</p>
<p>Also, Luke would not approve of this.</p>
<p>BTW I love how I post this same thing on the forums, and it gets deleted instantly.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Exactly.[/quote]</p>
<p>I removed your posts, due to you demeaning me and the server / community. You know nothing about me, or future plans with RSCEmulation, yet you come to the the community, demanding that I show you video proof of my access. Who are you to me? A nobody. I really didn’t / don’t care what you think of me, but you telling people, that I don’t have access to the dedi / hosting, that I’m monetizing RSCEmulation, to get funds and then abandon it, just because I won’t show you a video, proving myself, is just plain and out-right ridiculous and really shows a lot about your character.</p>
<p>As for monetizing RSCEmulation, That’s another BS post by CFF. Comes to RSCEmulation’s forums, saying that I’ve stuck ads all over the site (clearly he was mistaking) as I had actually removed the ads from the front of the site, but didn’t remove them from the forums. What he had assumed once again, were my ads, were actually still the ads Luke had put up, linked to Lukes Google AdSense, that I hadn’t removed yet (and still haven’t).</p>
<p>For the post selling rares back in to the economy, to help fund the server. Well, if you think that’s wrong, that’s your opinion. Luke himself offered a similar deal, to the community a little while back. I am not spawning or introducing anything new in to the economy, just trying to raise a little funds by offering the community an alternative option to subscribing. You can say Luke would have never agreed to that, but that’s where you’ll be wrong again CFF - as Luke DID do the exact same thing in the past. Just because you didn’t see a post, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.</p>

<p>When i see Pyru post, It’s like reading one of Lukes posts, The way he puts things across, He seems very intelligent. It’s like there in the same frame of mind. I have all faith in Pyru keeping RSCE alive.</p>

              <p>Zilent confirmed he will still work on it, but i’d expect it to take a lot longer.  Didnt realize how good of friends zilent+kryptix were so i’d assume zilent will just slowly ease back into it.  Wonder if theres any other devs that are trusted enough to help him…</p>

<p>So who is Pyru? Kryptix never gave anyone access. So how all of a sudden after his death he got access? Starting to think it’s faked somehow, I would think Zilent would be the person whom he would give access to it. Not some random who was an old Admin back in 2009.<br>
[/quote]That “random” was one of Luke’s friends and designed the RSCEmulation site a while back. Zilent never wanted anything to do with administrating RSCEmulation.<br>
[/quote]I could have sworn Luke said on multiple occasions that he was the only one with access, especially after what happened with Sarah.</p>
<p>That being said, I’m curious as to how he got access to everything…[/quote]Pyru was always an admin. I think he just disabled it for a while.</p>

It is kinda weird huh Code…</p>
<p>Isn’t Zilent MIA also?<br>
[/quote]Zilent is normally ‘MIA’.  He also does not visit this site anymore (the reasoning has been given on numerous occasions), and he normally keeps to himself.[/quote]After telling Zilent about Luke, he stopped going on MSN.</p>
