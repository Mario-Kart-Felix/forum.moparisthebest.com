<p>And without lowering the cost of subscribing to only cover keeping the server online and maintaining it, you are rolling in the dough. You would be making just as much as a 2nd FULL TIME JOB or, at the very least part time wages. Its as simple as that.</p>
<p>I dunno… maybe in the beggining u started out as honest and wanting to provide a good server for other runescape fans. But then over time, you realized just how much you could milk your players, slowing dropping the rates…and changing from mainly a server with focus on pking to just the right amount of grinding to keep ur money cows hooked. no point in denying it, the updates yourve released are proof enough.</p>
<p>We all know this, and most of us quit already. The players left are from angel…which is just the right type of cow u like, and the others, well…advertising on rs2 youtube videos and fucked up shit like that secured your place as the top server, free to milk as much as you want.</p>
<p>Funny thing is the players you used to cater to were ppl who had a passion for runescape, not classic, not rs2… im talking about old skool runescape… ppl who 10+ years later decided to replay thier childhood memories and would use google to find YOU.</p>
<p>Sad thing is those who know your two faces have tried and tried again to open a server that had your goals before you were corrupted, but have no chance when you have monopoly and control thier future.</p>

<p>What i meant here was the ppl who buy 10+ subs with real money and trade for ingame money, you can just as easily give stat reduction/namechange/whatever else you give now for using up a sub as a reward for eg: voting thru multiple links found on your website, each vote gives 1 point and a stat reduction would equal say 10.

<p>You presume I’m ‘rolling in the dough’ but we’ve only been profiting for around the 6 month mark. We didn’t even release subscriptions for the first 4-5 months and I was paying the majority of the server cost myself. Why shouldn’t I take the profit if it’s available? If RSCEmulation drops in player count and we once again go back into making a loss every month have a wild guess who will be coughing up to keep it afloat.</p>

</aside>
<p>uh huh, and how much in total was the shitty package u were on for the first 4-5 months, in the 6 months you have been taking the profits, you would have payed yourself back by now…and then some. You wont ever have to cover server hosting fees with money from ur pockets again…yourve seen to it that ur player base are the rs2/angel addicts that wont ever stop playing. Stop bullshitting and lower the cost of subs you leech.</p>

<p>You’re a twat mate, I implemented poison yesterday which pretty much everyone hates, I do these updates because I want to get it as close to RSC as possible. When we had fast XP rates it felt nothing like RSC so they were slowly lowered over time but even now they’re twice as fast as RSCA’s XP rates so why does our XP rates mean I’m milking the players? I’ve never seen you mention it on RSCA’s thread, why is that?</p>

</aside>
<p>So you added something to the game that many of ur players dont like…are they going to quit over it? no i dont think so… meanwhile you keep adding little shit like that, making it as close to the grindfest the real runescape was and in the end…guess whose sitting pretty.</p>
<p>Low xp rates are just a part of what your doing to milk your players. You are slowly molding this server into the goddam massive grindfest the real runescape used to be…slowly slowly changing aspects and adding more ‘benefits’ for subs over time, so that ur players are non the wiser. Dam…who am i kidding…yourve already passed that phase of ur plan…us old skool fans are already gone, you dont even have to hide ur intentions anymore…ur rs2 faglings love that shit…add a new slayer quest and theyll fucking worship you.</p>

<p>What’s the problem in that? Within a minute of searching ‘RuneScape Classic’ they can be in-game in the most developed and advanced RSC private server ever which also happens to be the biggest. I don’t get what you’re saying? If I was a player that sounds perfect to me.</p>

<p>“IF” you were a player, oh thats right you run ur server like a buisness dont you.</p>
<p>I found your server just after christmas, when i got it in my head i wanted to play runescape again…it didnt matter that the advertising you had back then was virtually non existant, i found you…and other diehard runescape fans found you too. If you had of kept it like that, your entire player base would of been made of old skool rsc fans. It would of been a server just for us ran by sum1 like us. But since you went out of ur way advertising on rs2 videos and fucked up shit like that, the old fans got shoved outa the way by rs2 kids who outnumber us a million times over and other grindfest lovers who want different things from a server then we do. That theres the problem…</p>

<p>Just because you think I’m corrupted doesn’t mean I actually am but you’re entitled to your opinion. I don’t get how I control their future either, if players want to go and play their server they’re more than welcome to. When a new server opens people do go and try it out but most of the time they realize it would take months of development to get anywhere near RSCEmulation so decide to stick with us which is fair enough…</p>

</aside>
<p>Banning direct links or server names is fair enuff but banning moparscape forums from showing up in ur forums or ingame is a form of control…its not a direct link to another server…just gives ur players awareness about what other servers are out there. Not everyone is interested in a “developed” replica of the grindfest we used to have to go through, why dont u let these ppl who feel the same way out of ur cellar. But this isnt what i meant here…i meant you and the ppl you pay to ddos other servers as soon as they become a threat…does RSC-LIVE ring a bell?</p>

<p>The same as it is now… We purchased the dedicated server and instantly got taken offline so had no choice but to buy SecurePort for the full price.

</aside>
<p>yes…but it has everything to do with you, this thread is a disscussion of this server.If you feel like you dont want to show your players where thier money is actually going or thereby showing just how much u pocket then thats ur problem.<br>
Since you dont want to share…im ganna have a stab at it…feel free to correct me if im wrong.<br>
First 4-5 months…i dont know say $300= $1500 out of ur pocket.<br>
6 months of being on secure port full price…$500-600?=$3600<br>
6 months of profiting thru subs while being on secure port like you claim, i know you made $4000 a couple months ago so lets call it 2 grand a month to cover the first few months if there wasnt much profit…so well call it $120,000.</p>
<p>$120,000-$3600-$1500= ballpark figure of around 110 grand of profit.</p>

<p>You’re criticising me for making my server closer to RSC? Are you serious? RSC is the game most of us played and loved for years, why wouldn’t I want it to be as close to that as possible? I can understand why some people prefer PK servers or servers with 50x XP but I certainly don’t and clearly maturity of the players don’t either as RSCA and RSCE have done so well…</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes the game we played and loved for years, i certainly dont remember enjoying…looking forward to or being exciting about grinding.</p>

<p>I do say so, clearly this must be the case as the majority if not all of the players that were with u from the beginning have left after you merged angel players over and started recruiting rs2 kids and started to notice the changes. If there are any of us left on ur server, they are a extremly small minority and clearly have no say of any outcomes that affect the server that belonged to us at one stage…</p>

<p>If they don’t want to play they don’t have to. They’re more than capable of clicking the X button and typing ‘runescape classic private server’ into Google which reveals all sorts of top lists and even links to this section. The funny thing is I encourage people constantly to vote and by doing so they end up staring at other RuneScape private servers which completely goes against your entire argument.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For starters…the top 100 or wateva website the links take you to is filled with rs2 servers. Bravo for letting players try n search for another classic server when there are very few and are vastly outnumbered by rs2 adverts. This is to my knowledge…the only site or section of a site that actually lists runescape classic servers  and runescape classic servers only. If u claim as u say they can easily find an informitive and up to date listing of current RSC servers through search engines, then why not make it even easier and post a link to this website on ur forums. Then youll know for sure your players are sticking with you because they like what this server has to offer and not because your cellar is dark.</p>
<p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:417, topic:307209”]Another random fact you’ve made up on the spot I guess. RSC-Live was never a threat, it was run by a guy who wanted his own RSCEmulation. The only good thing about it was the website Swo0osh made, in-game it was a unstable edit of RSCD that was down more than it was up. Their online count was completely faked, Swo0osh made a little script to register tons of account names and then ICodeForFame made Chris a bot to automatically log them all in. When they peaked at 76 players online I was told they actually had 29 players online.</p>
<p>Regardless of that, it’s amusing how you mention RSC-Live when it was the most obvious ‘make money quick’ schemes in recent RSC times, within 2 days of going live their had subscriptions up, encouraging players to purchase them, stealing RSCEmulation’s subscription vendor/card idea, etc. After all of that Chris shut it down and ran with the money as he got bored and his player count dropped. Instead of criticising him you decide to criticise me for apparently taking money despite spending months and months on this project. For example, there’s currently a bug with items being destroyed and I’ve been up all night trying to figure it out (it’s currently 7am GMT) so in all honesty I would argue that I (and anyone else who spends the amount of time I do) deserves a bit of income for investing the time we have but of course you will argue it because you dislike me. It’s absolutely fine for Reines, KO9, Chris, xEnt, Peeter and whoever else charged for subscriptions however, right? :)[/quote]</p>
<p>The very moment RSC-Live went online…it was on a staminus package that came outa his pocket and it wasnt cheap…he could not have even come close to recooping his losses let alone gain any profit like u claim when i know for a fact that only a handful of ppl paid for a subscription.<br>
RSC-Live was doing very well b4 the item wipe, which after ppl started to loose interest plus the fact that sum1 kept ddosing thier server. In the end only a few ppl who truly wished it to succeed stayed…but it died shortly after. Yes, they had subs and his server wasnt as ‘developed’ as urs, but pking there fucking owned…his combat forumla was attack oriented, 50 atck hitting 40 def both no pray hit one third of the times which is a hell of alot better then what ur shitty formula was. Who the fuck cares if you could still shoot thru walls n buildings or there were some bugs that stil had to be addressed…none of that concerned us because it was a pking server regardless of what chris actually thought.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:418, topic:307209”][quote author=OldSkoolRSC]yes…but it has everything to do with you, this thread is a disscussion of this server.If you feel like you dont want to show your players where thier money is actually going or thereby showing just how much u pocket then thats ur problem.<br>
Since you dont want to share…im ganna have a stab at it…feel free to correct me if im wrong.<br>
First 4-5 months…i dont know say $300= $1500 out of ur pocket.<br>
6 months of being on secure port full price…$500-600?=$3600<br>
6 months of profiting thru subs while being on secure port like you claim, i know you made $4000 a couple months ago so lets call it 2 grand a month to cover the first few months if there wasnt much profit…so well call it $120,000.</p>
<p>$120,000-$3600-$1500= ballpark figure of around 110 grand of profit.[/quote]<br>
As I said we’ve been on SecurePort since day one. I also have no idea how you ‘know’ we made $4,000 in a month as only I would know that. If you think we’ve profited anywhere near to 6 figures you’re out of your mind. Several months in a row I was investing £600 a month on advertisement campaigns such as Google AdWords and Microsoft Advertising (Bing) but stopped as it was a waste of money. It generated next to no traffic and I regret it. By no means am I denying it’s profited in the last few months but the figures you’re coming up with out of no where are a long way off. If it was making that sort of money I’d be handing my notice and dedicate all my time towards it but unfortunately that’s not the case.</p>

<p>As I said, our advertisement schemes are exactly the same now as they were when we started. We haven’t just decided to recruit RS2 players, we’ve always posted advertisements on RS2 websites as believe it or not a lot of people do remember RSC. RSC is a 10 year old game and it’s getting older by the day, if we only allowed people to play that actually played RSC the scene would be dying a lot quicker than it already is.</p>

<p>True, but seeing how in this scenario only classic players populated the server, updates and changes would of been for us so they would of been wanted, giving wateva lifespan you think it would of taken for the scene to die, a truly enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>Yes…did u read what i wrote? 30 genuine players free of ur reign n over on live pking was a more enjoyable experience then my entire time with emulation. I remember telling my mates ingame on ur server about live, and i also remember ppl spreading the rumour that rsc-live contained viruses…thats a pretty good reason for ur cows not to take the chance and why live didnt get much more players then that considering emulation was pretty much the biggest server at the time…and thats where his players would be coming from.</p>

You justified RSC-Live as being decent but it was obvious from the start that he was only interested in the money as the first updates he did was copying RSCEmulation’s subscription system. Anyway, where’s Chris gone now? It was such a good server and so well run, why did he up and leave with the donations?</p>

<p>I was a blind cow playing on ur server during the time of these server owners openining thiers, it was only recently my eyes were opened on how to search for current rsc servers. If i had any experience with those ppls servers and they looked like they were leeching on thier players then ofcourse i would of said something.</p>
<p>It was obvious from the start that he paid quite a bit to host the server from the get go so it would survive, to my knowlege he paid 1 month for staminus and during the 1st month set up subs to help recoop his losses. At the end of the 1st month was when his server was dieing and he didnt see the point in forking out another months server costing fees so he just quit. I hardly see him making off with the donations when i know for a fact only a small handful actually paid for a subscription, he charged 10 bucks at the time for a month so what…$50 bucks ish he got back. wow.</p>
