<p>I remove every post by b0nethugs I see no matter the topic, title, or content. For reasons I will tell you in PM if you insist (if you don’t already know). The reason is perfectly valid as well.[/quote]I don’t see why people want to silence TX, there are quite a few people that I would rather be silenced before him.  The only time his posts should be deleted is if they’re linking to something he controls because of his tendencies to infect people (a website he owns, a download link for something he’s made, etc.).  Also, there are numerous topics that he’s made that went on for days; I know you saw them because you’re online 24/7 and have replied to threads below his.  Why don’t you actually consider posts rather than just writing them off?  That’s the kind of crap that I’m talking about with preferential treatment (it’s on the other side of the coin, but it’s still not right).  I don’t recall off the top of my head who all has been banned, but that’s not even the major issue…  It’s the posts that are constantly being deleted whenever they have any shred of evidence.</p>
<p>How is it invalid?  It was evidence of you giving him preferential treatment, and you deleted it.  It’s preferential because he should have been punished for posting a mislead link, seeing you acknowledged it as such.  If anyone else had done that they’d be punished straight away, and the topic would be locked.</p>
<p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:960, topic:307209”]b0nethugs is T<span class="bbcode-b"></span>_X. He’s banned so his posts are removed…</p>
<p>And what he posted was idiotic. The <a href="http://www.rscemulation.net/old" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">URL he posted</a> was RSCEmulation’s old website that was in use for over a year. The ‘fake player count’ was the real player count, exactly as it’s shown in-game… I’ll happily go on TeamViewer and show people me directly querying the database to show how many players are online if it makes you happy.[/quote]There are many people that are banned that don’t have their posts removed…</p>
<p>If it was idiotic then why was it deleted and not used to make a mockery of him?</p>
<p>Also, you and I both know that adding a modifier to the online count is primitive and going to get you caught.  Don’t try and act as if you didn’t learn that from the numerous times it happened to other people.  Also, don’t forget that we’ve had numerous conversations on the topic in vent, including how to do it properly and how you’ve done it…</p>

If a post has malicious intents, you generally want to hide it because people might not get the context, or ignore any remainder posts and see said post as the truth.<br>
Therefore you sometimes just have to remove a post.</p>

And I do not find topics the same way as you do; I don’t even look at boards. I just use the ‘unread replies’ and ‘unread posts’ buttons, as well as reports. I don’t spend all my time searching for his posts either. So no, I did not see his posts and ‘not delete them’. If you were correct, and I did only delete the posts that incriminated Kryptix, then that would count as favoritism, yes. As for actually looking into his posts, I don’t have the time or trust to look into ANYTHING TX says. He has even FAKED evidence and sent it to me to try and get Kryptix banned, so I’m not ever listening to him again.</p>

b0nethugs is T<span class="bbcode-b"></span>_X. He’s banned so his posts are removed…</p>
<p>And what he posted was idiotic. The <a href="http://www.rscemulation.net/old" data-bbcode="true">URL he posted</a> was RSCEmulation’s old website that was in use for over a year. The ‘fake player count’ was the real player count, exactly as it’s shown in-game… I’ll happily go on TeamViewer and show people me directly querying the database to show how many players are online if it makes you happy.<br>
[/quote]There are many people that are banned that don’t have their posts removed…</p>
<p>If it was idiotic then why was it deleted and not used to make a mockery of him?[/quote]If people are evading, point us to it and we can reban them and/or delete their posts. If they aren’t, well, they wouldn’t be banned anyway. The only reason I don’t just ban TX is because he never stops evading, it’s easier to just delete his posts than have to discover a new account each time.</p>
<p>And I just told you, content doesn’t matter when I delete his posts, I’m not going to keep it there for ‘mockery’.</p>

<p>He’s banned, and thus should not be allowed to post. Simple as that. Read below for more in that. And I do not find topics the same way as you do; I don’t even look at boards. I just use the ‘unread replies’ and ‘unread posts’ buttons, as well as reports. I don’t spend all my time searching for his posts either. So no, I did not see his posts and ‘not delete them’. If you were correct, and I did only delete the posts that incriminated Kryptix, then that would count as favoritism, yes. As for actually looking into his posts, I don’t have the time or trust to look into ANYTHING TX says. He has even FAKED evidence and sent it to me to try and get Kryptix banned, so I’m not ever listening to him again.</p>

<p>It’s not just TX’s posts that you delete, and I never said you <span class="bbcode-i">only</span> delete posts that incriminate Kryptix.  I’ve made posts in this thread providing evidence over the years only to have them deleted.[/quote]The amount of threads there is pretty high, I don’t usually look at the ‘author’ part, and only look at thread titles that catch my attention. I did see his ‘model’ threads on there today and deleted both of them though.</p>
<p>The latest ones have only been TX and replies to his posts. Other than that I’ve deleted general flame, but I haven’t deleted anything with ‘evidence’ in it. I haven’t been a mod for ‘years’ either, and I don’t remember deleting any of your posts from this topic. I thought this was about me being ‘favoring’, not the general deletion of posts in the thread. I’m guessing they were considered spam or flame, you’d be better off private messaging a moderator proof instead, that stuff isn’t supposed to be public.</p>
<p>[quote=“CodeForFame, post:1569, topic:306881”]Snoopy is pointed out every single time, and it takes weeks/months for him to be banned, and is banned because he’s infecting people, again.[/quote]That’s not me though… I’ve had one person reported to <span class="bbcode-u">me</span> for being ‘snoopy’, but I didn’t get enough evidence to ban him. I’m guessing that probably means I favorite snoopy too, huh?</p>
<p>[quote=“CodeForFame, post:1569, topic:306881”]It will deter him from posting, which makes your job easier.[/quote]To be honest, knowing TX, I kinda doubt it.</p>

I disagree entirely.[/quote]</p>
<p>CodeForFame is right. Given you have a solid base without performance flaws, you’re having to write content that <span class="bbcode-b">could</span> kill your server if not implemented properly, which in most cases are not, especially if you have no testing agenda. Bugs and exploits are more commonly found after it’s been written, and even then there’s no guarantee you’re in the clear. Either way, no one here has the capacity to accomplish such things, even those who claim to be as gifted as they say.</p>
