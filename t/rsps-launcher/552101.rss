    <title>Rsps Launcher?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-launcher/552101</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
I&#39;m pretty new to making a rsps, I have at this moment a revision 718
I have in my client file Run Client and in the source World 1 to launch the server
Now is my question how do i put this online? Like I made a .jar of my Run client, but do players need the World 1 Launcher too?

Also another question how do I put a rsps online? I have tried anything!
Thank you for helping me out!</description>

              <p>Your explanation of your problem is a bit hard to understand, you should see a .bat file located in your server files and it should be called “run” or “runeserver” or something similar. make sure you leave that running and then just run the client and see if you can log in.</p>
