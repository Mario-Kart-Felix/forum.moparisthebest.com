    <title>Rsps Launcher?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-launcher/552102</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
I&#39;m pretty new to making a rsps, I have at this moment a revision 718
I have in my client file Run Client and in the source World 1 to launch the server
Now is my question how do i put this online? Like I made a .jar of my Run client, but do players need the World 1 Launcher too?

Also another question how do I put a rsps online? I have tried anything!
Thank you for helping me out!</description>

You need to several things to put a server online.<br>
A host/ip - <a href="http://www.no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.no-ip.com</a> (Example: AragornScape.no-ip.biz)<br>
Portforwarding : You need to make sure the port 43594 is open on your router’s administrator settings. (Dependent on your router type)<br>
Client and Source: You need to make sure your source is listening on port 43594, and make sure your client is connection to the right IP and port, (Example: AragornScape.no-ip.biz)<br>
If all of that is done correctly, you should be all good.<br>

<p>I have made a <a href="http://no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a></p>
<p>If I go to my settings.java there is public static final String SERVER_IP = “37.187.26.229”;<br>
Do I put my <a href="http://no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a> in it? Or what Ip else?[/quote]</p>
<p>Put your NO-IP domain in there. Also make sure you have the DUC Client downloaded and the host selected in the client.</p>

The players should only need the client to get on your server. Assuming it’s portforwarded and etc.<br>
