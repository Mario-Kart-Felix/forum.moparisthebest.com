<p>What do you mean by you can help with “Javascript” programming on a “718” base? Javascript is a web language, it has nothing to do with what revision the RSPS is based on.[/quote]</p>
<p>Loll. This is over two months old. I have already built the team and it is strictly closed to other developers.</p>

<p>You’re not giving a basic overview, you’ve literally put an image and told people you’re not telling anyone about it but they should get involved. Is this how you plan on leading a project? If you want people who are dedicated to you and what you do then you need to motivate them to get involved. Is it a paid job, is it for free? What level of dedication do you need? Is it an RSPS, is it for something else?[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes I am…<br>
I don’t need people dedicating themselfs to me, but rather their work, and their job.<br>
Yes of course, they are all paid-positions. It is an RSPS. It’s a 718.</p>
