    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-rsps-wont-work/487156</link>
    <description>I have tried time after time after time for literally over 24 hours trying to get it to work. I have it portforwarded. The port is open. I have the no-ip set up. DUC Downloaded and running. My server won&#39;t connect to the server and the internet won&#39;t bring up the website. It either says: &quot;Oops! Google chrome cannot connect to &quot;D3adscape.no-ip.org&quot;&quot; or it will say &quot;Page was interrupted&quot;. I have my server.java in my source set to my no-ip. My client.java set to my no-ip. and my static and in my client.java is 127.0.0.1. My gui is also set to 127.0.0.1. I have a D-link DIR 655 wireless router. What the heck do i do!?!?!?!?!?</description>
