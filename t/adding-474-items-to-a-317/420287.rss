    <title>Adding 474 items to a 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-474-items-to-a-317/420287</link>
    <description>Me and a friend decided we were going to remake 2007 runescape, around july 24th when piety was released. So we wanted the items to match it, since piety is in the 459 revision area, we wanted to add the 474 items... We haven&#39;t been able to find the items anywhere for download and we would appreciate it if someone could help us out? Maybe find a tut somewhere and post the link, or even just give us a download. 

Thanks - Benjamin</description>
