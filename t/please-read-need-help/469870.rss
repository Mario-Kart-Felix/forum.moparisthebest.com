    <description>I really want to start a server but don&#39;t know much about java, was wondering if I could get like a mentor type person, and/or a descent base to start on that isn&#39;t complete shit. Because I downloaded an original 317 PI and I couldn&#39;t add models.. If you would help me please post a link below to a client/source/cache and if you want to be my mentor I&#39;m 16 chill and like programming but cant do the good stuff &lt;/3 so help is nice. I would like to use Team Viewer/Skype/Raid call or some other means of communication..

<p>If you’re looking for a Programmer to “take you under their wing”, then you’ll probably need to bring something to the table. If you’re a fast learner, patient, and mature, then that’s usually enough for someone to be motivated to mentor you. You basically want to stand out as much as possible and contribute. If a Veteran sees your potential or motivation, then they’ll be much more likely to help you <span class="bbcode-b">and continue to offer you their assistance</span>.</p>
<p>Protips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As a beginner <span class="bbcode-b">ALWAYS</span> spend at LEAST 1 Month of working with your Base before you create a Release Thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be respectful and friendly. This is an immature community, and often people who display these character traits go farther than others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use the Search feature and Search Engines before creating a Server Help Topic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s your answer to wanting to create a RuneScape Private Server:</p>

<p>EDIT: Which type of Base did you have in mind? What do you mean by “one that isn’t complete shit”? Do you mean one which follows the Java Language correctly and fluently?</p>
