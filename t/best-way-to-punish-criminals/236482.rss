    <title>Best way to punish criminals?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-way-to-punish-criminals/236482</link>
    <description>Imagine a serial killer. One that doesn&#39;t care if he kills a 90 year old aids patient or a 2 year old. He gets caught, and (if American) is sentenced to death. Everybody happy, including the killer because he won&#39;t have any pain. Or not? Don&#39;t you think he gets away with it too easy? My solution: Torture!

You might think: what a fucktard, we don&#39;t do that anymore. It&#39;s way too cruel. But don&#39;t you think they deserve to feel pain too? A few weeks in a punishment camp and a killer will feel sorry. After a good torture session, put him to work in a labour camp. That way he has a use, and can pay back the costs he made when he was in jail. 

&quot;You can&#39;t treat a human as an animal&quot;, some people say. But don&#39;t you think a serial killer thinks about that when he is doing his thing? 

A terrorist. Their goal is to kill as many infidels as possible, and then die so they go to paradise. Won&#39;t he feel fucked up if he doesn&#39;t die?

No one should get Tortured or killed, and by killing a person that have killed another will also bring US down to their level.<br>

<p>Like I said, in some cases torturing isn’t right. But some people deserve it. And for those who don’t deserve it, but still are fucked up should be put in a labour camp, and with that I don’t mean making registration plates.</p>

<p>The best would be from an ‘Outer Limits’ I saw once, they had a computer to hook people up to to make them dream what the computer said.  So murderers were killed the same way they killed, over and over and over again, with all the pain and everything, just to wake up the next day and relive the experience over again.  The judge would sentence them to so many hundred deaths.  That would be excellent.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you call that easy too just die, you should know how it is in Norway.<br>
You can max get 21 years if you kill anyone, and most of the time you get less.<br>
And there is 4 times more murder in US than in Norway.<br>
And the prisons are better than in US.</p>
<p>So there is no connection between Death penatly and number of murder.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Sentenced to life here means 20 years in prison, and usually shorter if you behave well.<br>
But still, if they change prisons to be much tougher, by having forced labour and all that, it’d still be better than the death penalty.<br>
Also, they need to bring back the life-long sentence.[/quote]<br>
Netherland you come from?<br>
I compared it to American laws, not european.</p>
<p>It look like American punishment is about revenge, arent the US you can get more than 100 years in prison, or more than one Death Sentence?</p>
<p>I’am thinking just punishment is wrong, it should be easier to start a new life after prison.<br>
If a man/woman, get out of prison, and are not able to get a job or money, its very easy to get crimminal again, self if the punishment is bad.</p>
