    <title>[PI] Summoning Familiar Damage Counter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-summoning-familiar-damage-counter/396911</link>
    <description>Okay so im currently working on summoniong for my PI source and all is going well so far but im stuck on getting the damage by the npc to be counted as the players damage, so when the familiar does more damage to the opponent than the player the npc gets the drop meaning if fighting a player the opponent can run back and pick their stuff up, so i was wondering if anybody had any ideas on where to start? :)

thanks
