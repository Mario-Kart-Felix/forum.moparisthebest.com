    <description>[tt]In This tutorial you&#39;ll learn how to successfully add opening and closing doors to your private server!

[b]Source Tested[/b]: Delta
[b]Difficulty[/b]: Depends on the person.
[b]Files Edited[/b]: doors.cfg
----
[u][b]Intro[/b][/u]
Adding doors, is really simple actually. Although i was confused when i first tried to figure it out, its REALLY easy to do once you understand what does what.

[u][b]Common Setup[/b][/u]
So most &#39;door.cfg&#39; files look like this inside:

[code]door = 2726	3368	1533	-2	-3	-3	1	0[/code]

[size=8pt][b]First Two Columns[/b]: X and Y Axis&#39;s
[b]Third Column[/b]:The Direction the door is facing when open
[b]Fourth Column[/b]: The direction the door faces when closed
[b]Fifth Column[/b]: The state the door will be in before being opened or closed (Recommended to be the same as the closed direction)
[b]Sixth Column[/b]: always 1 (as far as i am concerned, i never changed it)
[b]Seventh Column[/b]: the height of the door.[/size]

[u][b]Explanation[/b][/u]
If you were to take all possible options for placement of the door,and put it in one square, it would look like this:

[IMG]http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn231/xSynysterFenceX/d00rs.png[/img]

[i]Key (I included a compus for better direction)[/i]--
[b]Purple[/b] = North
[b]Blue[/b] = South
[b]Red[/b] = East
[b]Yellow[/b] = West

Now your probably thinking, &quot;[i][b]okay why would you have Purple as north and blue as south, when they should clearly be switched around?[/b][/i]&quot; (blue being north and purple being south)

Well i have 2 good ideas on why that is:

1.Well i never really found out a straight answer, but here is my logic. Every time your character seems to log out or d.c, it always seems to [b]come back facing south[/b]. So my thinking is, since its default stance is to face south, then if you ignored the original rules of direction, [i]and replaced the real idea of the character facing south and pretend that the compus is actually facing north, it will be as if the door is spawning in front of them[/i].
--Which is why i think for some reason south = north as far as looks go.

2. Also, if you set the direction of the door as [b][i]SOUTH when closed[/i][/b] it opens towards the southern direction even though the door is in the northern part of the square, although [b][i]west and east are ALMOST never mixed up like this;depends on your situation[/i][/b], it seems that setting the door to [i][b]south will make the door OPEN towards the south, and setting it to North will make it OPEN towards north[/b][/i].

(Idea 2 seems more logical to me, probably made both more complicated then the needed to be, but a detailed explanation is a good one :D!)

[u][b]Over Head View Practice[/b][/u]
Lets tryout our idea with this overhead view i created.

[IMG]http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn231/xSynysterFenceX/rooomy.png[/img]

with the view of the map now (assuming your compus is facing north)
__[b]N[/b]__
[b]W[/b]__[b]E[/b]
__[b]S[/b]__
Before we start the examples, here is a key just a reminder of the direction codes:
-----
0= [b]WEST[/b] | -1 = [b]NORTH[/b] | -2 = [b]EAST[/b] | -3 = [b]SOUTH[/b]

[size=8pt][b]First Two Columns[/b]: X and Y Axis&#39;s
[b]Third Column[/b]:The Direction the door is facing when open
[b]Fourth Column[/b]: The direction the door faces when closed
[b]Fifth Column[/b]: The state the door will be in before being opened or closed (Recommended to be the same as the closed direction)
[b]Sixth Column[/b]: always 1 (as far as i am concerned, i never changed it)
[b]Seventh Column[/b]: the height of the door.[/size]
-----
We can add in the proper line of code to make the doors work:

[code]South:
door = ####	####	####	-2	-1	-1	1	0
//South door will open to the right because we set it to open to the east and close to the south
//It&#39;s also important to notice that its opening outward because we have it set on north

West:
door = ####	####	####	-2	-3	-3	1	0
//North door will open to the left because we set it to open on the east and close to the north
//It&#39;s also important to notice that its opening outward because we have it set on south

West:
door = ####	####	####	-1	0	0	1	0
//West door will open to the right because we set it to open to the north and close to the west
//It&#39;s also important to notice that its opening outward because we have it set on west instead of east

East:
door = ####	####	####	-1	-2	-2	1	0
//East door will open to the left because we set it to open to the north and close to the east
//It&#39;s also important to notice that its opening outward because we have it set on east instead of west[/code]

Now there is some &quot;[i]Technicalities[/i]&quot; in all of this, because depending on which way your facing, it can look like the door is either opening out or coming in.
---The best way to solve this is to compare the door swings to the house your working on, if the door goes in it opens inward, if it goes out, it opens outwards...simple.

Also, i obviously used no item id or coordinates, you have to make sure you get the correct id&#39;s of the doors your trying to open and the coords!
--I also took the liberty to take a screen shot of some doors and their ids for the pplz

[IMG]http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn231/xSynysterFenceX/Untitled-4-9.png[/img]

I know its barely even scratching the surface, but those are really basic doors

for a full object list (No pics) look [url=http://&quot;http://rspscodes.synthasite.com/object-codes.php&quot;]here[/url]

[u][b]End[/b][/u]
That&#39;s all there is to it! If you follow this tutorial (if i succeeded in explaining everything) you will be able to make almost every door in your Pserver open and close without flaw!

If you have any questions, please post them here i will try my best to answer them all. Also notify me if you notice any mistakes, thanx! :D

              <p>[tt]In This tutorial you’ll learn how to successfully add opening and closing doors to your private server!</p>
<h2>
<span class="bbcode-b">Source Tested</span>: Delta<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Difficulty</span>: Depends on the person.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Files Edited</span>: doors.cfg</h2>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Intro</span></span><br>
Adding doors, is really simple actually. Although i was confused when i first tried to figure it out, its REALLY easy to do once you understand what does what.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Common Setup</span></span><br>
So most ‘door.cfg’ files look like this inside:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">door = 2726	3368	1533	-2	-3	-3	1	0</code></pre>
<p>[size=8pt]<span class="bbcode-b">First Two Columns</span>: X and Y Axis’s<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Third Column</span>:The Direction the door is facing when open<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Fourth Column</span>: The direction the door faces when closed<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Fifth Column</span>: The state the door will be in before being opened or closed (Recommended to be the same as the closed direction)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Sixth Column</span>: always 1 (as far as i am concerned, i never changed it)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Seventh Column</span>: the height of the door.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Explanation</span></span><br>
If you were to take all possible options for placement of the door,and put it in one square, it would look like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn231/xSynysterFenceX/d00rs.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Key (I included a compus for better direction)</span>–<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Purple</span> = North<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Blue</span> = South<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Red</span> = East<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Yellow</span> = West</p>
<p>Now your probably thinking, “<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">okay why would you have Purple as north and blue as south, when they should clearly be switched around?</span></span>” (blue being north and purple being south)</p>
<p>Well i have 2 good ideas on why that is:</p>
<p>1.Well i never really found out a straight answer, but here is my logic. Every time your character seems to log out or d.c, it always seems to <span class="bbcode-b">come back facing south</span>. So my thinking is, since its default stance is to face south, then if you ignored the original rules of direction, <span class="bbcode-i">and replaced the real idea of the character facing south and pretend that the compus is actually facing north, it will be as if the door is spawning in front of them</span>.<br>
–Which is why i think for some reason south = north as far as looks go.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Also, if you set the direction of the door as <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">SOUTH when closed</span></span> it opens towards the southern direction even though the door is in the northern part of the square, although <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">west and east are ALMOST never mixed up like this;depends on your situation</span></span>, it seems that setting the door to <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">south will make the door OPEN towards the south, and setting it to North will make it OPEN towards north</span></span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Idea 2 seems more logical to me, probably made both more complicated then the needed to be, but a detailed explanation is a good one :D!)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Over Head View Practice</span></span><br>
Lets tryout our idea with this overhead view i created.</p>
<p><img src="http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn231/xSynysterFenceX/rooomy.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<h2>with the view of the map now (assuming your compus is facing north)<br>
<strong><span class="bbcode-b">N</span></strong><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">W</span>__<span class="bbcode-b">E</span><br>
<strong><span class="bbcode-b">S</span></strong><br>
Before we start the examples, here is a key just a reminder of the direction codes:</h2>
<p>0= <span class="bbcode-b">WEST</span> | -1 = <span class="bbcode-b">NORTH</span> | -2 = <span class="bbcode-b">EAST</span> | -3 = <span class="bbcode-b">SOUTH</span></p>
<h2>[size=8pt]<span class="bbcode-b">First Two Columns</span>: X and Y Axis’s<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Third Column</span>:The Direction the door is facing when open<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Fourth Column</span>: The direction the door faces when closed<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Fifth Column</span>: The state the door will be in before being opened or closed (Recommended to be the same as the closed direction)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Sixth Column</span>: always 1 (as far as i am concerned, i never changed it)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Seventh Column</span>: the height of the door.[/size]</h2>
<p>We can add in the proper line of code to make the doors work:</p>
<p>[code]South:<br>
door = ####	####	####	-2	-1	-1	1	0<br>
//South door will open to the right because we set it to open to the east and close to the south<br>
//It’s also important to notice that its opening outward because we have it set on north</p>
<p>West:<br>
door = ####	####	####	-2	-3	-3	1	0<br>
//North door will open to the left because we set it to open on the east and close to the north<br>
//It’s also important to notice that its opening outward because we have it set on south</p>
<p>West:<br>
door = ####	####	####	-1	0	0	1	0<br>
//West door will open to the right because we set it to open to the north and close to the west<br>
//It’s also important to notice that its opening outward because we have it set on west instead of east</p>
<p>East:<br>
door = ####	####	####	-1	-2	-2	1	0<br>
//East door will open to the left because we set it to open to the north and close to the east<br>
//It’s also important to notice that its opening outward because we have it set on east instead of west[/code]</p>
<p>Now there is some “<span class="bbcode-i">Technicalities</span>” in all of this, because depending on which way your facing, it can look like the door is either opening out or coming in.<br>
—The best way to solve this is to compare the door swings to the house your working on, if the door goes in it opens inward, if it goes out, it opens outwards…simple.</p>
<p>Also, i obviously used no item id or coordinates, you have to make sure you get the correct id’s of the doors your trying to open and the coords!<br>
–I also took the liberty to take a screen shot of some doors and their ids for the pplz</p>
<p><img src="http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn231/xSynysterFenceX/Untitled-4-9.png" alt width="385" height="398"></p>
<p>I know its barely even scratching the surface, but those are really basic doors</p>
<p>for a full object list (No pics) look <a data-bbcode="true">here</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">End</span></span><br>
That’s all there is to it! If you follow this tutorial (if i succeeded in explaining everything) you will be able to make almost every door in your Pserver open and close without flaw!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please post them here i will try my best to answer them all. Also notify me if you notice any mistakes, thanx! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
