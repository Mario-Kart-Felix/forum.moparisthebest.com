Hello I&#39;m using the Zdiddy Reloaded (ZDR) source, and the name of the server is [i]Demon Realm[/i]. This source is very well known and I&#39;m currently coding and editing, along with that I need a dedicated hoster that has had experience before. Please know that you must have some kind of fast computer along with internet. You will get Co-Owner on the server, I&#39;m looking for someone to host the longest they can (meaning &quot;dedicated&quot;). Another thing is plaese be familiar with posting server on moparscape status page and getting it online and all that. Please reply if interested in hosting the server, it&#39;s much appreciated if you can get back a soon as possible.

-thanks [i]Ryan1322[/i] / btw my in-game name on server is Venileo.

[b]Note:[/b][i]Server Ip Name And Port will be discussed after the job is filled.[/i]</description>

              <p>[quote=“MasterHelper, post:4, topic:201270”]Dedicated Host: A dedicated hosting service, dedicated server, or managed hosting service is a type of Internet hosting where the client leases an entire server not shared with anyone. This is more flexible than shared hosting, as organizations have full control over the server(s), including choice of operating system, hardware, etc. Server administration can usually be provided by the hosting company as an add-on service. In some cases a dedicated server can offer less overhead and a larger return on investment. Dedicated servers are most often housed in data centers, similar to colocation facilities, providing redundant power sources and HVAC systems. In contrast to colocation, the server hardware is owned by the provider and in some cases they will provide support for your operating system or applications.</p>
<p>This pretty much means that the internet can host it for you 24/7 with a very big price.</p>
<p>Hosting via Source/.bat: In MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows, a batch file is a text file containing a series of commands intended to be executed by the command interpreter. When a batch file is run, the shell program (usually <a href="http://COMMAND.COM" rel="nofollow noopener">COMMAND.COM</a> or cmd.exe) reads the file and executes its commands, normally line-by-line. Batch files are useful for running a sequence of executables automatically and are often used by system administrators to automate tedious processes.</p>
<p>Although a batch file is analogous to a shell script in Unix-like operating systems the limited syntax and commands means that they are less suited for general-purpose programming. These limitations lead to the widespread use of “enhancement” commands such as those in the Norton Utilities and later the replacement shell 4DOS in the DOS era.</p>
<p>DOS batch files have the filename extension .BAT. Batch files for other environments may have different extensions, e.g. .CMD in Windows NT and OS/2, or .BTM in 4DOS and related shells. There is no difference between the .BAT and .CMD extensions when the file is directly executed. However, when a shortcut is used to launch them, .BAT files run commands using the 16-bit <a href="http://COMMAND.COM" rel="nofollow noopener">COMMAND.COM</a> command processor whereas if the extension is .CMD, the batch commands are run using the 32-bit Windows NT cmd.exe with all command extensions enabled. Also, the Windows 9x family only recognizes the .BAT extension.</p>
<p>This pretty much means with your source, you can run it with the enviornmental variables set up correctly and with port forwarding. runserver.bat is the common name.</p>
