    <description>I remember hearing alot of commotion about how stupid the people who jumped out of the buildings were...

If i were in there, i might as well have done the same thing. Burning is one of the most painful ways to be killed... Falling to impact is probably one of the least.</description>

Eh… random factual thought… Could a parachute open fast enough to make any difference for you at all while just jumping from the TT’s?<br>

<p>A wide area parachute like BASE jumpers use could easily, although BASE jumping does take some skill, so you’d probably have to train all the people too :D[/quote]</p>
<p>Haha. That’s funny. Everyone in the TT’s would know how to base jump. That’s badass.</p>

If there was no hope to get down the stairs then I would wait it out, and maybe try to ride a sturdy part of the tower down, probably get to the top floor if possible so not much fell on me. if all else fails, when it begins to collapse, i jump out a window.</p>

i dont think i’d jump if I look down and I dont see anything but clouds im pretty sure i won’t survive it and probbly die from a heart attack before i hit the ground and since I want to live I’d try to run into the fire sure it will hurt but then again I could just roll around and extinguish the flames I might get a few burns but thats why you gotta run fast not to take as much damage to your body.</p>
<p>But yah if there is nothing u could do like all exits blocked or the only way out has been destoryed so its only me or the window… I would say I’d wait it out and see what happens next does the building collapse or not? rather wait and find out what happens ^^. Dying is the easy way out.[/quote]</p>
<p>We aren’t talking a few lousy flames. We are taking thousands of pounds of jet fuel burning. Your body would dissolve just being near it.</p>

Thats true, but other things also affect it. 2 747’s crashing into the biggest towers in the middle of New York is a little more dramatic and interesting to watch on the news than a hurricane in New Orleans.<br>

<p>They weren’t 747’s. Sorry.[/quote]</p>

<p>Yea my post was a little off. But the main reason it was on the news was that the levees broke when they were told they could withstand more.</p>
