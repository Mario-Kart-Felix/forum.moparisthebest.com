    <title>Help With my Webclient please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-my-webclient-please/348472</link>
    <description>Ok, My webclient keeps trying to connect to localhost, (127.0.0.1) but when I&#39;m telling it to connect to my IP.  This only happens with my webclient.  Either cause it&#39;s jarred or it&#39;s a webclient I don&#39;t know.  I have No-IP open, my server&#39;s run.bat is open.  Variables set.  Port forwarded correctly:

I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s doing this I&#39;m new to webclients so if I could please have some help I will be very grateful.

I think the soulution might be is to make the client read the IP it should connect to from client.class since it&#39;s the main class.  Right now it looks in gui.class  Am I correct?  But how do I do this?</description>
