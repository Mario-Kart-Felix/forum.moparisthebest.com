          <blockquote>
              <p>Use <a href="http://dropbox.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://dropbox.com/</a> which allows you to update the server while he’s offline. It will directly update it to his dropbox folder (providing you both download dropbox and connect.)</p>
<p>After you finish updating you can use <a href="http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/</a>.</p>
<p>So let me explain.</p>
<p>If both of you have dropbox it allows both of you to work on the same folder. Every time a file is changed, it updates it for both parties. So say you want to change the speed of the abyssal whip. You save.</p>
<p>Now, if your hoster has <a href="http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/</a> correctly installed and working properly, all you will have to do is compile. What Jrebel does is automatically loads class files to be read by the JVM without having to restart the server.</p>
<p>Not only will you be able to update the server from different locations with your friend, but you’ll be able to update the server without restarting it.</p>
