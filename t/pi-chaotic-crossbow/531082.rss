    <title>[PI] chaotic crossbow</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-chaotic-crossbow/531082</link>
    <description>I have been adding a fully working chaotic crossbow(with the bolt specs n stuff). But the crossbow never hits anything higher than a 20. May i ask why is that? The range bonus are added, i&#39;ve made it so it would be like rune c&#39;bow but rune c&#39;bow still hits higher.</description>
