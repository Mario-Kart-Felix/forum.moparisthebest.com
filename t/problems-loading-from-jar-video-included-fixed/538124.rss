As you can see in the video when I run the client using the IDE it runs perfectly(lol) and loads but after its been jarred
it doesnt seem to be able to load something(cache packed title i believe). 


i have no clue as i believe my paths are correct because the client loads in the first place and i dont understand the gibberish in the client mostly

EDIT: basically im a moron and commented something out i shouldnt have in the main method. the IDE ran the client fine using the init() method i believe. however everything else ran the main(string..) method with the commented out stuff. i need to learn about applets :P</description>
