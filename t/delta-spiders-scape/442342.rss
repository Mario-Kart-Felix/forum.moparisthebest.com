[center][b]Introduction:[/b][/center]

Hello Moparscape. I was recently browsing through my old desktop and I came across a very old Project I was working on 2 years or so ago called Spiders-Scape. Seeing as it was started 2 years ago, you could imagine, nothing was done. Anyways, I think I may continue this. I now have both the source and the client on my current desktop. So, I began (today) by deleting all of the original delta-scape&#39;s skills, considering they are horrid. As of now, I began working on skill handlers. I haven&#39;t progressed much today, but I plan on continuing this, and eventually, completing it. I understand Delta is almost dead, but after I found this, it brought back so many good memories.

[center][b]Content:[/b][/center]

As of right now, this is pretty bare and nothing to be proud of. Right now, the only skills [remotely] started is prayer and magic. I finished the bone burrying for prayer, and still working on magic. The client class is currently 20k+ lines. Before I began adding more content, I must clean out the classes a bit since delta is an un-stable piece of dump. Oh, and I added quick-chat, for skills, because at the moment, I am too lazy to add the actual skill menu&#39;s, well, it&#39;s not just that, I CBA to look up all of those id&#39;s. I have also added a basic music system, it will be improved on as time progresses. I wrote a basic tutorial island, however, I wasn&#39;t happy with it. Before I even think about creating another tut island, I must complete my &#39;main goals.&#39;

[b]Note:[/b] I might release this within the next few days, considering I must complete my studies before I can continue this project. Yes, there will be about 3 versions of this project.
