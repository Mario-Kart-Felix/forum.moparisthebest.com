<p>Yes, i think it is just the gazzascape client, like i said; other clients connect and load up into game properly but then they will go weird and it will make my character no clip across the map… Thats why i cant use any other client, its something to do with the gazza client</p>

<p>&amp; It is a 562, I have everything setup correct, and i have changed the ip in the client and applet_sub1.java to the ip address.<br>
I can connect using localhost with the gazzascape client on my vps computer, but when i try too connect using the gazzascape client on MY computer, it just dont load up, but then if i try using khanz it works…</p>
