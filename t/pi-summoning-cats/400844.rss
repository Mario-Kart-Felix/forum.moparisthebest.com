    <description>ok so on my prroject insanity server, i set up a summoning base that has nothing on it but cats..it works perfectly until u drop the cat, then the cat turns around and attacks you, ive already been told to remove the NPC&#39;s from the agressive method, but the thing is, their not listed in that method..so they should have no reason to be aggressive..anyone have a fix for this?</description>
