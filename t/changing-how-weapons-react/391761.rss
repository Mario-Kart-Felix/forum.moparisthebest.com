    <title>Changing how weapons react</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-how-weapons-react/391761</link>
    <description>I downloaded Decimation-X, which I believe someone said was a delta source, to use as a beginning source to my private server. The source has custom items in it, including a dragon bow. I have been trying to get the dragon bow to work, but it only trains melee stats. I have gone into anything I could think of where it might be to find what to change, client.java, weaponhandler.cfg, itemhandler.java, etc, and found everywhere that the Magic Bow is to try and make this bow work. I got it to have the animations and the attack styles (accurate, rapid, long range), but it isnt considered a bow, doesnt use arrows and doesnt increase range. Anyone know how to help? Thanks :)</description>
