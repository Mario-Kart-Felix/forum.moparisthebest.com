    <title>Getting a guitar soon though. Need your opinions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-a-guitar-soon-though-need-your-opinions/408907</link>
    <description>I&#39;m getting a guitar soon pretty soon. But i&#39;m on an extremely tight budget because my parents can&#39;t afford one, so I don&#39;t have much to work with. I have $120 to spend. What do you guys recommend for beginners? Acoustic or electric? Also what brands would you suggest, I want a quality built guitar, something that&#39;ll last me a couple years or until I can afford a much better one.

I had my eye on a basic Fender if I decide to go electric.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Eh Pretty Easy, post:5, topic:408907”]Get an acoustic, because there’s no way $120 will be enough for both an amp and a guitar. I’ve had my acoustic for a bit over two years now, and I bought it used so all in all it should be around 4-5 years old, assuming I remember the details the seller told me correctly.</p>

<p>I really like it and the sound is rich as long as you have good quality strings.[/quote]<br>
I paid about $150 for an amp and guitar once.  They both sit in my closet gathering dust because they’re absolutely terrible and no one will buy them.</p>
<p>If you’re only able to spend $120, but an acoustic.  If you can, put that money away and save for a decent electric guitar and amp.  I have an Epiphone Les Paul, and a Fender Mustang amp, both are great and about $500 together iirc.</p>

<p>Schecter guitar’s are amazing. I own the C-1 Standard and it’s one of the best guitar’s I have ever played, and it was only $550! It’s better than a Standard Strat in my opinion, but an American Start or Tele beat’s it. I want the 35th Anniversary C-1. :[</p>

              <p>Yeah, with $120 you’re not going to be able to find a gutiar AND an amp. Although, Fender has this begginger package that is around $200 and it’s what I started out with. It’s pretty good honestly. For $200 anyways. You get a small Fender Squire SP-10 and a Fender Squire SE, along with a guitar strap, case, cable, and a tuner.</p>

<p>Or you could look at just the guitar which is $120 but you will need to find an amp to stick it into, of course:<br>

              <p>Get an acoustic, because there’s no way $120 will be enough for both an amp and a guitar. I’ve had my acoustic for a bit over two years now, and I bought it used so all in all it should be around 4-5 years old, assuming I remember the details the seller told me correctly.</p>

<p>I really like it and the sound is rich as long as you have good quality strings.</p>

It’s perfect for beginners that wish to experiment with a variety of styles and it really is dirt cheap.</p>

              <p>I’m getting a guitar soon pretty soon. But i’m on an extremely tight budget because my parents can’t afford one, so I don’t have much to work with. I have $120 to spend. What do you guys recommend for beginners? Acoustic or electric? Also what brands would you suggest, I want a quality built guitar, something that’ll last me a couple years or until I can afford a much better one.</p>
<p>I had my eye on a basic Fender if I decide to go electric.</p>
