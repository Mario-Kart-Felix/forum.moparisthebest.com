    <title>Minigame text above heads problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minigame-text-above-heads-problem/182192</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve created a minigame like castlewars where people can fight against the opposing team for pk points. My problem is that I want people to see which person is on which team by placing a txt4 above each of the players heads that you can see. This is because when you kill someone on the other team you get their stuff and can wear their team armor to disguise yourself.
I think I&#39;m on the right track, but when I put my code in in [b]public void process[/b] it messed up my server. I am trying to find a possible solution.

Here is my method:
[code]
public void showTeam()
{	
		
		int numonline = PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount();
		int i = 0;
		for(i = 0; i &lt; numonline; i++)
		{
			if(PlayerHandler.players[i].godTeam == 0)
			{
				PlayerHandler.players[i].txt4 = &quot;Saradomin&quot;;
				PlayerHandler.players[i].string4UpdateRequired = true;
			}
			else
			{
				PlayerHandler.players[i].txt4 = &quot;Zamorak&quot;;
				PlayerHandler.players[i].string4UpdateRequired = true;
			}
		}
	
}
[/code]

Here is what I put in public void process()
[code]
if(teamPK()) //is the player in the team minigame
     showTeam();
[/code]

What should i do?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 17, 2008, 01:55:08 PM[/size][hr]anybody?</description>
