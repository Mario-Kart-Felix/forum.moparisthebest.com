    <title>.bat... able to rename files?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bat-able-to-rename-files/102801</link>
    <description>hi is a .bat able to rename files? like *.java to *.bat? cuz it will be easier to find something you dont know where it is because the windows find engine finds stuff into .bat files and not into .java files, if it is possible maybe i could get the code for it?
thanks.
