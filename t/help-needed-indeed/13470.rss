    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Setting up the Server[/b]
First off we need to Download Java Development Kit(JDK) it can be found At this link: http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/download.html Find JDK 5.0 on that page and press download then scroll down and press Accept then scroll down and Download the Offline Installer. Next, Run the offline installer. click next all through the installation. Now we have JDK installed so we need to move onto Downloading a server. In my previous tutorial revisions i have stuck with NixScape but i think it Might be time for a change as NixScape runs on VERY old coding and is VERY unstable So i would suggest downloading Project 16 which can be found at Http://p16.dodian.com and was coded by Wolf using WhiteScape. Ok we have a server, We have JDK, We have No-IP, now we need a client so if you already have a client your good to go. but if not you can get MoparScape V. 3.0 @ http://moparisthebest.com/moparscape.html Ok. that sums up this part of the tutorial next is Setting up your Firewall.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where do I put the source I downloaded? In the moparscape map or where?</description>
