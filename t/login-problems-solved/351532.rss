    <title>Login problems *SOLVED*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/login-problems-solved/351532</link>
    <description>I have downloaded and installed Moparscape, and I had to make a few changes to the .bat file so it would run on windows 7 X64 bit. Here is my current .bat file.
[code]@echo off
cd &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\MoparScape&quot;
title Running Bot
&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe&quot; -noverify -Xmx500m -cp .;./MoparScape.jar; Bot 0
::param 0 for highmem, 1 for lowmem, another 0 to make the song not startup
[/code]

Now, I run it as administrator, and it successfully downloads the cache
I click &quot;Start server&quot; and then I login to a random username and password like it told me to do.
And here is the error I get.

So I tried using a different name, and got the same error.

Here is the console from the time that I opened moparscape to the time that I tried to login.
