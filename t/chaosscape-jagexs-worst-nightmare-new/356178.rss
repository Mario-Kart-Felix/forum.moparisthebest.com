    <description>[center][b]Welcome to the new ChaosScape development, here&#39;s the original, outdated version- Credits to I Vain I for original:[/b][/center]

[quote=&quot;I Vain I&quot;][img]http://chaosscape.net/images/media/development.png[/img][center]Welcome to the ChaosScape 317 project development thread.
Our team consists of many wonderful coders, helpers, and assistants, all of which do a wonderful job.

Though, our project doesn&#39;t just consist of a RuneScape Private Server.
We have the whole package.
[b]If you wish to join this development team, you may apply here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,444626.0.html[/b]

We have will be releasing our server, under the GPL licensing to the public, allowing this server to be more widely used, to allow many more coders to adapt to the better coding conventions and methods.
[/center]
So far what our site has:

[ul][li]Standard 317 source[/li]
[li]MySQL-integrated 317 source[/li]
[li]TeamSpeak server[/li]
[li]Extremely similar RuneScape-styled forums[/li]
[li]Very complex website-Grand Exchange system. (Not completely finished, though will be soon)[/li][/ul]

Grand Exchange(:

The Grand Exchange is being hand-typed by me, I Vain I, and was made using RuneScape&#39;s 2010 CSS with the 2007-2008 Website template.

The images do not show, as they haven&#39;t been dumped into the database yet; though, this will be working shortly.

The template is nearly finished, and each &#39;part&#39; is handled in a different file.
For instance, all searching for items/scanning/reading the database is handled in search.php.

All of the methods pertaining to the rising of item prices, is all handled in rise.php.

It&#39;s a very detailed coding, and the server side methods will be fixed soon (will add a supply/demand system to the server and change the item price to a static integer, to be able to change itself).

Also, working on the algorithm to find the rise/fall percentages, store up to 180 days of the item&#39;s last price changes, and a graphing method.




Will add more information on this project later, as I must get back to the Grand Exchange. :)[/quote]
