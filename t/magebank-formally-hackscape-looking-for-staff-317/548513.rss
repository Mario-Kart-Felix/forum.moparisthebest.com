[CENTER]Who we are[/CENTER]
[CENTER]We started off as a small server back in 2008 known as HackScape. It was booming we had over 500 players active playing at once. Even though we had an auto-restarter set every 60 minutes :fp:  
After years of playing and having fun things went on and people moved on. We&#39;ve been up and down for a while but our main problem was we never really advertised and now we&#39;re here to make a change.

[CENTER]Every server has the same thing... They always post the same kinda thread. Well I&#39;m gonna keep this short and sweet and only put tell you about our best features! :)[/CENTER]
