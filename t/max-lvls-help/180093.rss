    <title>Max lvls help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/max-lvls-help/180093</link>
    <description>ok, im going to explain this as best as i can... when your training or w\e and you reach all your combat stats to the max lvl like 99 and your combat lvl would be 126..

and you could set it so that all your stats can go to 100 and that would be the new max lvl (100)..  get it? ok well.

i need to make it so that all my lvls stay 99 exept hp i want it to go up to lvl 100. 
Note: i don&#39;t want a command to just give me 100 hp or go in and set it to like 100\99 o.0..

i want the new max lvl to go to 100 only for hp while keeping other stats maxed at 99.. does anyone know how to do this?</description>
