<p>If your not here to help, then don’t post.</p>
<p>Look for a shop in the server, then find the name of the shop. Let’s say the name of the shop was ‘Skilling supplies’. Search for Skilling_supplies in your server and you’ll find something. You might find a list of shops in a .cfg file, maybe it’s not a .cfg file.</p>
<p>Add a new shop at the end of the list, but not the direct bottom. Right before the [EOF] or whatever it says in the [ ]s.<br>
Copy the shop above it and paste it where I said to. Change the ID from whatever it is to 96. Now back to the ‘Skilling supplies’ shop. Look for the NPCs ID that you clicked on to open the shop, then search for it in your source. Find where it says something that contains ‘openshop’, or ‘shop’ and add the NPC you want to click to make your new shop open. Let’s say you want the NPC’s ID to be 399. Copy the code for the ‘Skilling supplies’ shop and paste it under the skilling supplies shop (where you click the npc to open the shop). Change the npc id to 399 and the shopID to 96. Compile and run. Log in game and spawn the NPC 399 and it should open the shop you made.</p>

<p>Thank you so much <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>But there are no shops in the server, I’m making this from a halfway cleaned source <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>

<p>Oh by making shops you meant really creating the shops.</p>
<p>Download a pali76 source with shops and rip them. I can see you don’t know how but you want to know how. You want to make it yourself but you can’t so you came to mopar, so we recommend downloading it which you might not want to do because you’ll feel like you didn’t make it yourself. This topic means you didn’t want to make it yourself because you don’t know how. Don’t hate me for this, we both know it’s true. Best thing to do is download one that has it and rip it, as I’ve said above.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alright lol thank you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
