    <description>alright well i wanna start my own rsps, and i needed someone that can code because im still learning and i cant code that well so i need someone that can, the person will need to do most of the coding and i will make him my partner 50/50.  I have experiences with how a private server should be runned i was apart of a team before just not coding wise and now i would like to start my own.
