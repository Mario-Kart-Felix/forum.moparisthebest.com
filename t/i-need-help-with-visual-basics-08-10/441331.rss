    <title>I need help with Visual Basics 08/10</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-visual-basics-08-10/441331</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to make visual basic color bot beacause I want to do something by myself. So it&#39;s little &quot;stupid&quot; to ask help if I want to do something just by me. But I have to get started so I want to make the cursor moves on the object/npc. I need codes to find color in my screen and put cursor on it.

Please help  :rolleyes:</description>

              <p>I did a similar project when I was really young and failed miserably. It is definitely not easy to make a good colour bot (hell, even ‘good’ ones suck hard). I would recommend trying something else.</p>
