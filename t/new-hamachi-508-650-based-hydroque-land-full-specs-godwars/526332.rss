    <description>[font=courier]Welcome to my server page here on Moparscape![/font]

Just to say I am not a 24/7 server but my uptime is like 12/7.

This is under development by me as we speak and is super playable.
This server revolves around PKing, PvNPC, Minigames (A lot work), and Bossing.

Totally nice Owner and has a few people playing.
Full specs are included and very much good animations. (Barely any bug)

Full godwars dungeons

Hamachis: (Reserve only one slot)

CodyRSPS_3
CodyRSPS_4
CodyRSPS_5

Passwords: 123  :|

Totally active and is changing!

Credits to Paul for his source... A lot of bug fixes towards me.

All potions work.
Some armor needs tweaked to original strength.

Downloadable Client. (I have added .bat files for jre6-jre7 on 32 bit and 64 bit)

Client has World Map and Item List installed!

Server is waiting! Come be a pseudo part of my community!
