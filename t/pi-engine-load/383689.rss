    <title>[PI] Engine load?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-engine-load/383689</link>
    <description>okay so this is my first rsps and im new to java (been learning as i go for a month or so :P)
im using sagi x evolution as a base and have made quite a lot of changes however i recently noticed the engine load with about 11 players on is at 20% this is while on a vps too, im not totally sure what the engine load actually is i know that the higher it is the more lagg there will be however im not totally sure of what factors effect it, if someone could explain this to me and possibly show me how i can fix this i would be extremely greatful

thanks :)

<p>You don’t know what you’re talking about. Custom items have no effect on a servers performance.</p>

              <p>yeah i know its really high cause i used exion’s source(which sagi x evolution is based on) before and it was 0.3% with one player on but with this its 2% which is a rather dramatic increase lol</p>
<p>there are quite a few customs like artefacts, pvp armours, chaotics, claws, sol and other stuff, however the only stuff i dont really want out of those is the artefacts lol,</p>
<p>would that effect it much?</p>
