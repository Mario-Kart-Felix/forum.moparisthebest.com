    <title>So I&#39;m looking to buy a camera</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-im-looking-to-buy-a-camera/347268</link>
    <description>I&#39;m in need of assistance for buying a digital camera for some interior design photography and close up graphics work.
I&#39;ve been looking at some of the Sony range and that seems pretty good, but really I&#39;m just looking for some recommendations.


I&#39;m looking to spend £150 or below really. (about $230)


Any advice or recommendations are appreciated. :)</description>

              <p>Yeah, I mainly use a 35-80mm for reversing(actually mounted to the camera rather than on another lens), even on say f4 80mm offers quite a nice DOF with focusing from a few inches to a good 20 ft, reduce zoom down to 70 or 60 for more magnification, less dof and all that good stuff.</p>

<p>Yesssssssssssssss, but sensor size &gt; lens quality(pro £3k fukken pieces of metal and glass yo) &gt; pixel density &gt; light conditions &gt; mold in lens &gt; megapickles  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>You should only need more than 6mp when you’re printing bigger than a4(ideally 9 or 12mb at least for a3), 6mp will be absolutely fine for web work but resizing anything &gt;5mp down to 640x480 and any camera will look almost professional. iPhone, anyone? My dslr shoots 12.1 but I’m always quite comfortable cropping large portions of a picture out resulting in 6mp pictures, resized down quite a bit in some cases. I keep full sized copies but I rarely upload 6 megabyte pictures for a few obvious reasons.</p>
<p>On a compact though, you’ll really have to read a few reviews at the very least and look at a lot of sample images if you’re really concerned about quality. One thing not to get caught up on is how bright the pictures look, house interiors are actually MUCH darker than they look in real life, so ideally you want a camera good in low light off the bat, and this usually means getting a good camera with a lower mp count(not quite sure they make these yet… lol)</p>
<p>[quote=“SomethingToHide, post:10, topic:347268”]Megapixels has VERY little to do with image quality.</p>
<p>Sony is paired with Zeiss, who makes SICK ASS lenses.[/quote]</p>
<p>Sick ass but expensive lenses. Wouldn’t mind having an 85mm f1.4 for free though.  ;D :o</p>

<p>On a Point and Shoot camera, it’s kind of hard to know. You can’t follow reviews because the people buying them don’t really know what a good picture is or what to look for. Like the old ass person who reviews an HDTV saying it’s the most beautiful thing ever. =/</p>

<p>Not really worth it, DSLRS are a huge step from P&amp;S but the low end ones(talking sub entry level) will still be terrible for low light unless using a nice and fast prime, plus it costs quite a bit more and all that.</p>

<p>Manual controls should be a must to an extent. You want to be able to control at the least either the aperture or the shutter. Controlling both would be awesome but a little daunting to the new photographer. Features like an awesome flash and face detection and direct printing capabilities aren’t needed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I wouldn’t say it’s a must, aperture and shutter priority is nice and my old compact/bridge style camera has full pasm modes which is cool, but even on the m mode the camera still wanted to decide to do something different in very dark conditions than what I asked it very nicely mind you, to do.</p>

<p>The lens quality in P&amp;S cameras isn’t anything spectacular. Only meant for what it’s called, pointing and shooting. Meant for people like tourists or friends who take impulse pictures like crazy. Unless you get an expensive manual P&amp;S and use a tripod, you won’t be amazed. And noise is one of the biggest problems of the little cameras. Not only cause of bad image quality and inaccurate representations, but for compositing you have to match the noise also.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Lenses are funny though, I mean I picked up a 300mm f4.5 Nikkor-h procued from 1969-72 for something silly like $100, it gave stunning results back then and even today considerably better results over any consumer zoom and probably better than some prosumer zooms purely because of the price, nikon produced a Nikon AI ED and ED-IF version 2-3 years later with much better optics that didn’t sell for much more but you’re talking about 30 year old lens that produces excellent results(full manual mind you, unless you have a higher end nikon or any pentax/other type camera with in body metering) for $130. Might seem a lot but today’s equivalent is $5,800 or so, give or take. Sure you get f2.8 over f4.5(or 4 I think for the ED versions), vr swm etc and vastly superior optics but even the older equivalents from the 80s and 90s still go for more than $1,300 used.</p>
<p>Similarly all the old minolta etc lenses are still fantastic price/optics wise and beat any new lenses by miles.</p>

<p>The lens on there probably isn’t a macro lens. It won’t be like a P&amp;S where you have one lens which goes from wide to semi zoomed and also does macro shots. You’d need a good macro lens for macro shots. Can’t tell you much about Canon lenses, but I know the “plastic fantastic” macro lens I use is also made in the Canon mount.</p>
<p>Cosina 100mm macro. Build quality is awful, but the optics are incredible. Thus, cheap lens with really good pictures.</p>
<p>It’s also rebranded, so there are other "plastic fantastic"s under a different brand name but same optics. Look into it.</p>

<p>If you don’t have the money to spend it might be worth it to save up. Even though the kit lens on the lower A series DSLRs is sub par to many, many more lenses, it is tons better than any P&amp;S I can think of.</p>
<p>Sony isn’t even one of the more expensive brands either, especially when you take into account the lens and cheap lens lineup.</p>

<p>Thank you, that was very helpful, although, just looked at the pricing of that A100 on eBay, and even the ones in used condition are in excess of £200, and considering I’ve just left school, off to college next, and have no job, that’s quite a lot.</p>
<p>I think I may just stick with something similar to that Sony camera mentioned by Tabbykiller, I mean, can there honestly be that much difference in quality between the two?</p>

<p>Yeaah I know, I was bored a couple of nights back so I went through about 60 pages of the graphics section (before you even started and you were asking nooby questions :P), and just looked at all your work, and all of SomethingToHide’s, found some nice photography and a bit of compositing, inspired me to do a bit with my room.</p>

<p>Just who I wanted, you do a bit of compositing (exactly what I’ll be using it for) and photography right?<br>

<p>Ah, I guess it’s not worth the extra what is it, approx 600 pixels difference between 10 and 14.<br>
So, what lenses to get? :rolleyes:</p>
