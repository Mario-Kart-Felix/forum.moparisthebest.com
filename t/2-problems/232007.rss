    <description>im re posting this, because i have a trail but im stuck, the current proble  now is that he said to make sure i save as &quot;all files&quot; i switched it, but it makes a new document this this time. so do i keep it there, or is something wrong. heres the repost on the problem.

ok first and probaly most important. the compiler.
YES i have jdk, and no i dont really have an error. it SAYS it compiles fine, yet NO changes in my client.java file are actually being updated. thing is, i have like a month of coding in the client file, yet none of it is on. so heres where i am confused. yes i have tryed all the compilers i can find, NONE of them have worked. the server used to be hosted on my friends comp, and the compiler didnt work there either. so now i wonder, is it my source? idk, but when i go back to the file the changes and additions i put in are still there. so im pretty desperate for a compiler.

2nd thing pretty small.
as ive seen in a bunch of servers, they have 30 minute restarts. well i need to know how to make one, or add one. after the half hour mark my computer starts to go into major lagg. and my brother isnt happy. YES i have a life, and im not going to sit home and keep restarting my server. so i need to know if that is possible for a begginer like me. this is something i havent researched yet at all, but if it turns out to be harder then i thought i want some support here Big Grin.

thx all if you know the soultion or some help to EITHER of these. i appreciate it greatly if you reply!</description>
