    <description>How do I move a Shop that is currently at the skill area to a new skill area I&#39;m making. I&#39;m using Allstar-Scape Source V2. I&#39;m changing everything in it to fit my needs, but I&#39;m a bit new to the autospawn.cfg file. I never bothered to mess with it. Thank you very much!</description>
