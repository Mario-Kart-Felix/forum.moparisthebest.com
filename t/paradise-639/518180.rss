We have tons of shops spread all over the world of Paradise.
We also have alot of creatures and special items listed below.


WE HAVE:
Chaotic Weapons! 
Spirit Shields!
Dragon Claws!
Armadyl Godsword!
Vesta and Statius!
Torva and Void!
Partyhats, Santa Hats, H&#39;weens! 


Our players goal in Paradise is to become the #1 best of the server.
Well, in that case we have the following skills below!

WE HAVE:
Woodcutting!
Thieving!
Crafting!
Mining!
Smithing!
Cooking!
Fishing!
And More!


We also have herblore which is the rarest and hardest skill in our economy.

WE HAVE:
Overloads!
All extremes make-able!
Normal potions make-able!


We also have tons of bosses to face!

WE HAVE:
All godwars bosses!
Corporal Beast!
Nex!
Barrows brothers!
And more!

ALL skills other than Dungeoneering work in Paradise and can be trained the exact same way as on RS. 
The EXP rate is easier than RS but low enough to keep the game fun, challenging AND rewarding!

___________________________________________________________

Had enough yet? Wait.. theres more!

For the server we like to encourage competition; we host frequent events to get the community involved in activities. 
Our players consider it their second home! 
This community is very different from ones found on other servers because we have hardworking staff members that are active around the clock. 
The staff members here are dedicated as well as trustworthy. 
The staff members are not the only ones that decide what changes are going to be made, the community plays a large part in decisions concerning the server frequent polls on the forums help everyone voice their opinion fairly! 
If you feel this server is for you then come join us here at Paradise, we&#39;ll be waiting!
