    <title>Missing Time and Skill-Was Hoping Someone Could Code This For Me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/missing-time-and-skill-was-hoping-someone-could-code-this-for-me/125495</link>
    <description>Synopsis of what I&#39;m looking for:
I have basic script to perform a repetitive task in a game called ConquerOnline2.0 thus far and it works fine. This would have to be done using procedure&#39;s i assume? I&#39;m  in need of it to shut off after (insert adjustable time here) then click:
(677, 757,True);
wait(1500);
(625, 450,True);
wait(1500);
(530, 410,True);
________________________
i know it needs done using procedures but I&#39;ve a lot to do this week and was hoping someone could code for me then post back  :) I&#39;d appreciate it if not i suppose i can do it myself later  :D was hoping to train skills while away and be able to shutoff.
Thanks in Advance

program ConquerOnlineTornadoLeveler;
Var x,y : Integer;
Begin
Repeat
X:=510
Y:=350
if (findcolorspiral(x, y, 189,50, 70,980, 640)) then
Clickmouse(x+5, y+10, False);
Wait(550);
ClearDebug; //optional
Until(False);
End.</description>

              <p>well, you could make a command prompt to shut off your computer entirely, which could help in certain situations.</p>
<p>I could also make a small procedure to click start then shutdown as well (Assuming you are running Windows XP).</p>
<p>[code]program ConquerOnlineTornadoLeveler;<br>
{.include SRL\SRL.SCAR}<br>
Var<br>
Leveltime : Integer;<br>
Const<br>
TimeToStop = 10;  //Time to run the script IN SECONDS<br>
{  ^important^  }</p>
<p>Procedure Finish;<br>
begin<br>
Wait(500);<br>
Mouse(677, 757,1,1,True);<br>
wait(1500);<br>
Mouse(625, 450,1,1,True);<br>
wait(1500);<br>
Mouse(530, 410,1,1,True);<br>
end;</p>
<p>Begin<br>
SetUpSRL;<br>
MarkTime(leveltime);<br>
Repeat<br>
if (findcolorspiral(x, y, 189,50, 70,980, 640)) then<br>
Mouse(x+5,y+10,1,1,False);<br>
Wait(550);<br>
ClearDebug; //optional<br>
Until(TimeFromMark(leveltime) &gt; (TimeToStop*1000));<br>
WriteLn('Leveled your tornado for ’ + Inttostr(TimeToStop) +‘Seconds’);<br>
Finish;<br>
End.[/code]</p>
<p>That should do it for you.  Let me know if you need any other adjustments.<br>
Note that I set up the Constants for SECONDS, not milliseconds, so its a little more user friendly.<br>
Also, you have the mouse set to right click, then it does nothing else except repeat right clicking that color until the time is up.</p>
