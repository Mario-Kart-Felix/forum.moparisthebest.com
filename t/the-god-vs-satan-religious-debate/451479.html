<p>Purpose of this thread: there’s just a few points I want to clear up which I can’t do so in the previous thread for obvious reasons.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "Pink Phat", 
&gt;God is more of a peaceful character, who created the world.</blockquote>
<p>If we’re talking about god of the bible here, god has killed millions more people than satan has. Satan killed 11 people, god killed millions directly or indirectly. Let’s not forget the bible tells tales of god flooding the whole earth to start fresh (and look where that got us).</p>
<p>But by all accounts in the bible god is not peaceful, take the story of the tower of babel for instance, a united man all speaking one language attempted to build a tower that would reach the heavens, god not wanted any of this gave different groups different languages so they could no longer cooperate. Whether or not you interpret this literally or not, it says something about gods character, he would rather divide (and conqueror) man rather than have man cooperate.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "heatrn11", 
&gt;because you obviously don't understand the difference between God the father, God the son, and God the Holy spirit.</blockquote>
<p>Would now be a good time to remind you that other people who read and follow the bible don’t believe in the son or holy spirit? There’s several thousand sects of christianity because people who read and follow the bible can’t make up how the bible should be interpreted. Divine word of god? Then why can’t the followers decide on what should be and what shouldn’t be followed.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "heatrn11", 
&gt;God loves, God wants everyone to come with him to heaven, and he gives everyone a choice to pick heaven or hell.</blockquote>
<p>It’s not a choice though, is it? Do as I say or face eternal damnation of unimaginable agony. That’s like a rapist telling his victim “don’t fight or I will stab you”. I won’t even bring up the idea of free will, either.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "heatrn11", 
&gt;To tell you the reason why God hasn't proven himself to Earth, is that, God has actually revealed himself in the past.</blockquote>
<p>But he hasn’t. The bible is not proof that god has proven himself, the bible is the claim that requires the proof. The bible claims god flooded the earth and had 2 of every species of animal on one boat, this is demonstrably false on nearly every point. The bible claims that Jesus was born in nazareth, it has been shown through excavations that there is not and has never been a city on the site where nazareth is claimed to be. The bible claims plagues in Egypt (and was the bane of my childhood religious classes, seeing that I was interested in Egypt and knew that these claims were nothing more than fictional stories despite being 6), again this is demonstrably false as no evidence or historical records exist barring one book. There’s dozens of other things in the bible that are contradictory or have been proven false, the only claims in the bible that can’t be proven false are claims that can’t be proven as well, such as the entity of god. A flying spaghetti monster or the pink unicorn or even a dragon in a garage all share the same properties as god, they cannot be proven and they cannot be proven. Just because you cannot disprove gods existence does not make the idea credible.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "heatrn11", 
&gt;For a future question 'Who created God if God created everything?'. Simple answer God wasn't created he always was, always is and always will be.</blockquote>
<p>Pure speculation on your part. To quote Carl Sagan, “In many cultures it is customary to answer that God created the universe out of nothing. But this is mere temporizing. If we wish courageously to pursue the question, we must, of course ask next where God comes from? And if we decide this to be unanswerable, why not save a step and conclude that the universe has always existed?”.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "heatrn11", 
&gt;Example, Hitler killed thousands of jews, what he did was wrong, but in his mind set he believe it to be right.</blockquote>
<p>Hitler also said he believed he was doing gods work. Because of the nature of the statement, you really can’t say that he wasn’t.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "heatrn11", 
&gt;So if the kitten was sick and the kitten was dieing, you'd be happy and I'd be in a state of depression.</blockquote>
<p>Any sane human being who feels empathy wouldn’t feel happy at the suffering of another. This isn’t what you said but it is relevant, some very influential christians have publicly stated that the only reason they do not kill people is because the bible tells them it is wrong. I find such a position saddening, I do not need a creator of a universe personally telling me what is right and wrong, and I do not need threat of punishment to refrain from doing bad things. I feel empathy therefore I do not attempt to place another person in a position of suffering.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "heatrn11", 
&gt;You can't try and criticize God if you Know close to nothing about his exists or how he thinks.</blockquote>
<p>But we have the bible that states what god has done and we can criticise those actions. We can prove that a lot of claims in the bible are demonstrably wrong but it doesn’t change the fact that the bible claims that this is how god acts. The bible claims he would rather flood the whole earth and kill all its inhabitants rather than attempt to fix the problems. The bible tells us that because a woman (who had no knowledge of right or wrong, I might add) who ate from a tree, god decided that all humans born are born into sin and must repent. I find the act of blaming people for actions that they were not responsible for and could not have possibility prevented absolutely morally corrupt.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "heatrn11", 
&gt;Only an intelligent designer or creator rather, could put the universe together and make every single particle work with each other.</blockquote>
<p>If you’re going down the “intelligent design” route, could you perhaps explain some problems with the “intelligent design”? Such as humans having a near useless appendix which can burst requiring people to have them surgically removed. Such as people having wisdom teeth that serve no current purpose, which cause people unnecessary pain and also require the person to have them surgically removed.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "heatrn11", 
&gt;Can i ask you a question? How was the universe formed?</blockquote>
<p>Well, we start with the big bang, where space-time expanded from an infinitely dense and hot point. Just kidding. This is a trick question, whether or not we know how the universe came to be is irrelevant. Scientists and people who do not believe in a religion do not generally claim to know how the universe came to be, and from a naturalistic standpoint we may never have the means to know. But as I said, it’s irrelevant, as you yourself cannot claim to know how the universe came to be other than pure speculation that god did it, and in which case I want to refer you to the Carl Sagan quote I posted earlier.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "Pink Phat", 
&gt;From an atheist point of view, Satan wll obviously win.</blockquote>
<p>From an atheist point of view, god and satan are made up constructs found within a book and do not exist. However it’s obvious that satan would win! Hail satan!</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "Loveandpower", 
&gt;If a person who does not believe in God states they believe in Satan then they are not a real atheist.</blockquote>
<p>The definition of an atheist is one who is not a theist. The phrase “all babies are atheists” comes about because babies have no knowledge of religion and therefore do not believe it therefore are not theists, so they are atheists.</p>
<p>Minor nitpick but I feel the distinction has to be made when we’re dealing with people some of whom are under the impression that atheism is a religion.</p>

<p>I can see where your coming from but I still look at it in the sense that the classification <span class="bbcode-b">itself</span> about what an atheist believes in. Most people who say they do not believe in heaven claim to be atheist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there is no faith, how can they say they believe in Satan then?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>if someone believes in satan then by definition they are not an atheist</p>
<p>atheism is the lack of belief in a theism, theism is the belief in a diety, a diety is generally defined as a supernatural entity with superhuman powers</p>
<p>angels fit the definition of dieties and according to the bible satan/the devil/lucifer is a fallen angel hence a diety and believing in satan is belief in a diety which is theism which isn’t atheism</p>
<p>EDIT: of course there is such a thing as “atheistic satanism” in which the person does not necessarily believe in any deities or supernatural elements and merely follows the ritualisms and traditions but I don’t think it fits in to this argument, when someone claims to be a satanist and/or worship the devil they usually believe in it when it isn’t intended to be taken seriously</p>

<p>If we’re talking about god of the bible here, god has killed millions more people than satan has. Satan killed 11 people, god killed millions directly or indirectly. Let’s not forget the bible tells tales of god flooding the whole earth to start fresh (and look where that got us).</p>
<p>But by all accounts in the bible god is not peaceful, take the story of the tower of babel for instance, a united man all speaking one language attempted to build a tower that would reach the heavens, god not wanted any of this gave different groups different languages so they could no longer cooperate. Whether or not you interpret this literally or not, it says something about gods character, he would rather divide (and conqueror) man rather than have man cooperate.</p>

<p>Any sane human being who feels empathy wouldn’t feel happy at the suffering of another. This isn’t what you said but it is relevant, some very influential christians have publicly stated that the only reason they do not kill people is because the bible tells them it is wrong. I find such a position saddening, I do not need a creator of a universe personally telling me what is right and wrong, and I do not need threat of punishment to refrain from doing bad things. I feel empathy therefore I do not attempt to place another person in a position of suffering.</p>
<p>[quote]Quote from “heatrn11”,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only an intelligent designer or creator rather, could put the universe together and make every single particle work with each other.[/quote]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re going down the “intelligent design” route, could you perhaps explain some problems with the “intelligent design”? Such as humans having a near useless appendix which can burst requiring people to have them surgically removed. Such as people having wisdom teeth that serve no current purpose, which cause people unnecessary pain and also require the person to have them surgically removed.[/quote]</p>
<p>So you are stating that Satan killed eleven people? I am very interested in where your statistics come from. Due to the fact that sin as a whole is represented by Satan and his followers, factors of death such as murder (the biggest one) account for Satan’s ‘kills’ IF your extent is inferring that the flood is God’s ‘fault’ (it’s not, and like I previously stated, there was a completely reasonable choice, Noah was ridiculed for it). God doesn’t ‘threaten’ people; most atheists incorrectly interpret his actions.</p>
<p>I have no idea how the separation of the ToB relates to ‘cooperation’ or a lack thereof.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that you are pretty much judging Christians by a select few; either you misinterpreted what the influential ‘Christians’ said (note the quotation marks), or they weren’t genuine Christians at all (think WBC and Ronnie James Dio.) Your murder theory is ridiculous and even if murder were not part of the ten commandments, it would still come into account with Jesus’s golden rule. I don’t see why you are labeling Christians as not ‘empathetic’. I don’t think there is any difference between the amount of empathetic Christians and empathetic atheists.</p>
<p>Does every organ have to specifically serve a purpose? Humans were not created perfectly, so I do not see how they have to be perfect.</p>

<p>I disagree, you see, it was god who damned humans to original sin and while satan may be the implement, god is ultimately responsible for the damnation of the human race</p>
<p>I want to elaborate something, god kicked humans out of the garden of eden because eve ate the forbidden fruit, however god never gave adam and eve the knowledge of right and wrong, good and bad so while god forbid eve from eating from the tree she wouldn’t have known it was wrong to do so in the first place</p>
<p>of course all this is ignoring the fact that god is responsible for humans committing sinful acts in the first place but that’s a whole mess of semantics which isn’t really what we are discussing</p>

</aside>
<p>like I hinted to, it was a divide and conqueror tactic from god hinting that he isn’t necessarily peaceful, since all humans spoke the same language before building the tower of babel and had to co-operate to do so, god took away their means to do so by removing their common language</p>
<p>I didn’t bring it up the first time but one could attribute gods actions to remove humans single common language as being directly responsible from all the resulting implications of that action, people may not have had wars over land and language if we all spoke the same language and shared the same land, and my reasoning for thinking this is that the bible tells that building the tower of babel was only possible because of the shared language and humans cooperated to do so, people at war generally don’t co-operate with each other</p>

<p>that right there friend is the no true scotsman fallacy</p>
<p>the wbc are christians just like lutheranism are christians, they both follow and believe in the bible and the only difference is they interpret different parts differently, and since there is evidently no “true” way to interpret the bible, anyone who interprets the bible however they like and believes in the biblical god and jesus can be called a christian</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have no idea what you are referring to</p>
<p>if you are referring to the “murder theory” as what you said before about satan being the representation of sin then allow me to give an analogy and then maybe some context would be provided</p>
<p>you say that god flooding the earth doesn’t mean god directly killed the people as satan is the representation of sin and therefore satan is responsible for the killings, what would you say then if someone kills another person with a gun? you could argue from your logic that the person didn’t kill the person but the gun killed the person, and going even further you could argue the person didn’t kill the person but it was satan as satan is a representation of sin and killing a person is a sin</p>
<p>however I quoted the floods as it is something everyone is familiar with and even people who are not familiar with christianity will know the tale, there are other verses in the bible which may have been more relevant to quote, and I’ll list one now</p>
<p>Genesis 38, New International Version (NIV), Judah and Tamar</p>
<p>38 At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah. 2 There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and made love to her; 3 she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er. 4 She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan. 5 She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him. 6 Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 7 But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the Lord’s sight; so the Lord put him to death. 8 Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother.” 9 But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother. 10 What he did was wicked in the Lord’s sight; so the Lord put him to death also.</p>
<p>as you can see here, god viewed er as wicked and put him to death, and when onan refused to oblige the request of judah to impregnate his dead brothers wife and chose to waste his seed instead, god viewed this as wicked and put onan to death as well</p>
<p>the context of the quote may be debatable however god killed er as he viewed him as wicked, and killed onan for refusing to raise a child with his dead brothers wife, is satan responsible for this?</p>

<p>my bad for not providing full context of the quote, heatrn11 stated that someone who hated a cat may be happy at the sight of his death and that he would be depressed about it, I responded stating every human who isn’t a psychopath can feel empathy, of course the purpose of this thread was so I could get heatrn11 to elaborate on what he means so I may be hitting and missing but the point is I am not stating that christians cannot feel empathy</p>
<p>the sentence or two after what I posted wasn’t necessarily directed to anyone but I felt it was relevant to what I posted, and I made sure that I didn’t generalise at all hence the “<span class="bbcode-b">some </span>very influential christians” descriptor, I am not saying all christians feel the same way I am simply stating that I feel the fact that some (and a very small minority at that) do is saddening to me</p>

<p>I never brought up the issue of humans being perfect, merely that we are not intelligently designed, we can be intelligently designed and not be perfect</p>
<p>as an analogy imagine having a computer that has a heater fitted, the heater is a negative impact on the computer that serves no purpose for the heater, but if one were to remove the heater one could describe it as an intelligent design choice and it doesn’t necessarily mean that the computer is now perfect</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I do not believe god exists however what I think when I picture god is as described in the bible which is largely contradictory</p>
<p>I see that many christians believe that god is an ultimate source of good and happiness but at the same time I see that the all powerful all knowing inventor of everything created evil to begin with, and more specifically in the bible I see god punishing people for being wicked by killing them</p>
<p>ideas such as morals and ethics are human constructs, there is not and cannot be such a thing as absolute or universal morals even if they come from god, and as such based on my own morals and ethics I view some acts god does as stated in the bible to be morally and ethically wrong while other acts may be considered kind, but I view such inconsistent behaviour as very disturbing, akin to a crazed gunman who may kill one person but reward another person with riches and happiness</p>

<p>Niall, in all means it sounds like you are just being as defensive as you can to persuade your side more. It’s pretty clear you don’t believe in the bible so why do you care?</p>

</aside>
<p>well, regarding the religious debate, I’m not trying to convert people as it were if that’s what your getting at, but I do care about attempting to give people a better perspective on things if they’re open to it</p>
<p>regarding the same-sex marriage debate, I consider same-sex marriage a civil right so long as marriage provides legal rights that no other status provides, while a civil partnership that provides all the legal rights marriage will do it’s still a huge discrimination against same-sex couples with absolutely no logical reasoning why, if a church wants to prohibit marrying two people of the same sex that’s their business but for the government to prohibit it is outrageous especially when there are churches open to the idea of allowing same-sex marriages</p>
<p>of course I only started this thread as I said because I don’t fully understand what heatrn11 is getting at and obviously can’t ask him in the other thread, personal curiosity is the only reason</p>

<p>well, you’ve yet to reply to any of my arguments in the previous thread without sidestepping them, you could start there I guess <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>and a quick edit, I’m not particularly tied to ‘my side’, I’ve learned a hell of a lot from being exposed to opposite viewpoints or even viewpoints I am indifferent to and have changed my position a few times because of it, while I’m not particularly religious I do find some religious discussions on these forums to be quite educational</p>

That's where you're wrong though.  I remember learning that God told Adam and Eve to specifically not to eat from the tree of knowledge.

<p>yes but the knowledge of knowing that what she was doing was wrong wasn’t gained until she ate the fruit in the first place</p>
<p>she was told not to eat from the tree but wouldn’t have known that going against gods wishes was wrong, merely that it would be going against gods wishes</p>
<p>of course the garden of eden was a pointless exercise since god knew what was going to happen beforehand, I don’t view the garden of eden as gods divine test of humans, god created man in his image and man is inherently created imperfect and I find the garden of eden an extremely poor excuse to ignore the sins god commits because god is perfect and humans are the ones who created sin</p>

        <p>I would like to debate a few of your points, and don’t take anything said personally (as it’s a debate).</p>
<blockquote>Quote from Niall
If you're going down the "intelligent design" route, could you perhaps explain some problems with the "intelligent design"? Such as humans having a near useless appendix which can burst requiring people to have them surgically removed. Such as people having wisdom teeth that serve no current purpose, which cause people unnecessary pain and also require the person to have them surgically removed.</blockquote>Evolution. It is speculated among evolutionary researchers that over time humans have evolved, and it is proven. Humans have changed over time, and there are fossils of giant fossils, as with dwarven-like fossils. It's speculated that over time the cranium became smaller and wisdom teeth weren't needed. The appendix HAS been proven to have a use - which is that it creates endocrine cells which help with peptide hormones and other various chemicals. It's also considered a safe-house for bacteria essential for digestion in the stomach.
<blockquote>Quote from Niall
The bible claims that Jesus was born in nazareth, it has been shown through excavations that there is not and has never been a city on the site where nazareth is claimed to be.</blockquote>It is speculated that there was no city called Nazareth DURING biblical time periods. Nazareth was started around the 70 CE period (around the time of the First Jewish War). Artifacts have proven it's existence. 
<blockquote>Quote from Niall
The bible claims plagues in Egypt (and was the bane of my childhood religious classes, seeing that I was interested in Egypt and knew that these claims were nothing more than fictional stories despite being 6), again this is demonstrably false as no evidence or historical records exist barring one book.</blockquote>It has been proven that Egypt did experience plagues during the said biblical time period. Archaeologists do believe that the mythical ten plagues occurred in the ancient city of Pi-Ramses and they have uncovered evidence that leaves questions, as to why an entire capital just vanished? Stalagmites in caves have shown weather changes during the period, it is known that the Ramses environment was a warm, wet climate and had a dramatic shift to an incredible drought. 
<blockquote>Quote from Niall
I want to elaborate something, god kicked humans out of the garden of eden because eve ate the forbidden fruit, however god never gave adam and eve the knowledge of right and wrong, good and bad so while god forbid eve from eating from the tree she wouldn't have known it was wrong to do so in the first place</blockquote>I just read over Genesis 1-3 directly from the bible. The bible never said that when Adam or Eve were created that they had no knowledge of right or wrong, but had no knowledge of good or evil.
<p>My information has been gathered from various reliable sites, personal knowledge, research, and the bible. Some of your questions can be answered by research. I look forward to a well sought response.</p>

        <p>I think the title should be changed honestly… you  can’t  just  say  God and  Satan and when  there are several deities out there. That’s like making this specific ally a fight against believers of the christian faith vs nonbelievers. While keeping other religions out.</p>

        <p>I made the thread to see if people actually knew the difference between both of them, let me reply to this in the fastest way possible hmmmm.</p>
<blockquote>Quote from "Niall", 
&gt;It's not a choice though, is it? Do as I say or face eternal damnation of unimaginable agony. That's like a rapist telling his victim "don't fight or I will stab you". I won't even bring up the idea of free will, either.</blockquote>
The reasons for human beings being here on the Earth in the first place was to worship him, so he created both Adam and eve the first human beings according to the Bible. Now Adam and eve were specifically told by God that they could eat from any tree in the Garden, but not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge and good an evil(If they hadn't eaten from the tree we wouldn't have our knowledge but there wouldn't be death either). But Eve was persuaded by a snake, AKA Satan to eat of the fruit. She ate the fruit, gave some to her husband Adam.
[font=arial black]So what am i trying to clarify?[/font]
What I am trying to say is that God gave them a choice, he knew the outcome, he knew every single detail, but yet he still gave them a choice.If that's not love then I don't know what is...... Maybe it's a father dieing for his family from a home intruder, a son pushing a mother out of the way of a incoming car. Maybe even a family putting a sick dog to rest. 
<p>Not think in your head just this once, that God is real. Wouldn’t you think the death of the millions of humans that he himself created pains him, wouldn’t he hate to let his own ‘children’ go to hell and suffer eternal damnation of unimaginable agony. But God only makes one decision, he never changes his mind, he’s still the same God from the beginning of time, time doesn’t effect him.</p>
<p>We’ll never understand this mainly because we’re mere human beings, we lack the intelligence to comprehend God, we barley understand him, and yet we always defile him. Man will keep trying to understand God with no prevail, they’ll keep trying to get ‘physical’ evidence that he exists, to no prevail. But the evidence is right in your face, ‘ya’ know, but I guess you don’t :S.</p>
<p>[font=arial]I’ll get back to you ‘None believers XD’ when I have the mental capability to(Because I stayed up all night on Black ops o.O) until then it’s sleepy time.[/font]</p>
<p>oh yeah one more thing, I don’t have enough [font=arial black]faith[/font] to be an atheist, because to believe that something was created from nothing just requires A LOT of it.</p>
