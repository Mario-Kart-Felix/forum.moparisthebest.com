        <blockquote>If we're talking about god of the bible here, god has killed millions more people than satan has. Satan killed 11 people, god killed millions directly or indirectly. Let's not forget the bible tells tales of god flooding the whole earth to start fresh (and look where that got us).</blockquote>
<p>Everything happens for a reason. I and nobody else knows God’s plans. We do know, according to the Bible, that the world was an evil place. People were committing sins left and right. God warned the people through Noah that they would die. Anyone who wanted to come onto the ark could, God gave an option and people used their own free will not to listen.</p>
<p>The story of Noah could be interpreted as a version 1.0 of the Rapture. God is giving people an option to either accept Jesus Christ and live eternal life or suffer eternal torture in the Lake of Fire.</p>
<blockquote>But by all accounts in the bible god is not peaceful, take the story of the tower of babel for instance, a united man all speaking one language attempted to build a tower that would reach the heavens, god not wanted any of this gave different groups different languages so they could no longer cooperate. Whether or not you interpret this literally or not, it says something about gods character, he would rather divide (and conqueror) man rather than have man cooperate.</blockquote>
<p>You are correct in say God is not peaceful. God sent the Israelites to wipe out entire nations of people.</p>
<p>I disagree when you say God “divided and conquered” man. In verse 5 and 6 of Genesis 11 we read that God recognized they could do anything as one. I do not know God’s plan but I would like to speculate; God realized if man learned they could do anything as one, they would put themselves on a pedestal equal with God. God knows the heart of man, we read in Jeremiah 17:9 that, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?”. God knows that man is proud and boastful. Once Man proclaimed they were equal with God, God would have to destroy him. God didn’t want this, instead he chose to give each man a separate tongue.</p>
<blockquote>Would now be a good time to remind you that other people who read and follow the bible don't believe in the son or holy spirit? There's several thousand sects of christianity because people who read and follow the bible can't make up how the bible should be interpreted. Divine word of god? Then why can't the followers decide on what should be and what shouldn't be followed.</blockquote>
<p>If you follow the Bible then you must believe in Jesus Christ (the son). That is a fact, otherwise you are not a Christian. When Christ was baptized by John the Baptist what happened? God came down in the form of a dove and said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</p>
<p>In John 4 23-24 Jesus says, “But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” KJV</p>
<blockquote>It's not a choice though, is it? Do as I say or face eternal damnation of unimaginable agony. That's like a rapist telling his victim "don't fight or I will stab you". I won't even bring up the idea of free will, either.</blockquote>
<p>It is a choice. God gave us free will to decide what we want. Why did he give us free will, why not just make robots? God only knows. We read in Matthew 7 13 and 14, Jesus says, “Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.”</p>
<p>The Father works in all of our hearts. He gives every single man, woman, and child an option to accept eternal life and many reject him.</p>
<blockquote>The bible claims that Jesus was born in nazareth, it has been shown through excavations that there is not and has never been a city on the site where nazareth is claimed to be.</blockquote>
<p>Jesus was born in Bethlehem but I’m sure that was an honest mistake on your part.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>God hasn’t shown himself to people because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. I think I’ll just quote the whole of Hebrews 11;</p>
<blockquote>Now faith is [the] substantiating of things hoped for, [the] conviction of things not seen.
<p>2 For in [the power of] this the elders have obtained testimony.</p>
<p>3 By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by [the] word of God, so that that which is seen should not take its origin from things which appear.</p>
<p>4 By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained testimony of being righteous, God bearing testimony to his gifts, and by it, having died, he yet speaks.</p>
<p>5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before [his] translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God.</p>
<p>6 But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]. For he that draws near to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them who seek him out.</p>
<p>7 By faith, Noah, oracularly warned concerning things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which [is] according to faith.</p>
<p>8 By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance, and went out, not knowing where he was going.</p>
<p>9 By faith he sojourned as a stranger in the land of promise as a foreign country, having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with [him] of the same promise;</p>
<p>10 for he waited for the city which has foundations, of which God is [the] artificer and constructor.</p>
<p>11 By faith also Sarah herself received strength for [the] conception of seed, and [that] beyond a seasonable age; since she counted him faithful who promised.</p>
<p>12 Wherefore also there have been born of one, and that of one become dead, even as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the countless sand which [is] by the sea shore.</p>
<p>13 All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar off and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.</p>
<p>14 For they who say such things shew clearly that they seek [their] country.</p>
<p>15 And if they had called to mind that from whence they went out, they had had opportunity to have returned;</p>
<p>16 but now they seek a better, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he has prepared for them a city.</p>
<p>17 By faith Abraham, [when] tried, offered up Isaac, and he who had received to himself the promises offered up his only begotten [son],</p>
<p>18 as to whom it had been said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:</p>
<p>19 counting that God [was] able to raise [him] even from among [the] dead, whence also he received him in a figure.</p>
<p>20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</p>
<p>21 By faith Jacob [when] dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped on the top of his staff.</p>
<p>22 By faith Joseph [when] dying called to mind the going forth of the sons of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.</p>
<p>23 By faith Moses, being born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child beautiful; and they did not fear the injunction of the king.</p>
<p>24 By faith Moses, when he had become great, refused to be called son of Pharaoh’s daughter;</p>
<p>25 choosing rather to suffer affliction along with the people of God than to have [the] temporary pleasure of sin;</p>
<p>26 esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he had respect to the recompense.</p>
<p>27 By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he persevered, as seeing him who is invisible.</p>
<p>28 By faith he celebrated the passover and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.</p>
<p>29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as through dry land; of which the Egyptians having made trial were swallowed up.</p>
<p>30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encircled for seven days.</p>
<p>31 By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with the unbelieving, having received the spies in peace.</p>
<p>32 And what more do I say? For the time would fail me telling of Gideon, and Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah, and David and Samuel, and of the prophets:</p>
<p>33 who by faith overcame kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped lions’ mouths,</p>
<p>34 quenched [the] power of fire, escaped [the] edge of the sword, became strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, made [the] armies of strangers give way.</p>
<p>35 Women received their dead again by resurrection; and others were tortured, not having accepted deliverance, that they might get a better resurrection;</p>
<p>36 and others underwent trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, and of bonds and imprisonment.</p>
<p>37 They were stoned, were sawn asunder, were tempted, died by the death of the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, afflicted, evil treated,</p>
<p>38 (of whom the world was not worthy,) wandering in deserts and mountains, and [in] dens and caverns of the earth.</p>
<p>39 And these all, having obtained witness through faith, did not receive the promise,</p>
<p>40 God having foreseen some better thing for us, that they should not be made perfect without us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of those people went by faith. They didn’t need to see works.</p>
<p>There will come a day when people will accept a man for performing great works: making statues come to life, make fire come down from heaven, etc. People will be amazed and worship him. That man will be the AntiChrist</p>
<blockquote>Pure speculation on your part. To quote Carl Sagan, "In many cultures it is customary to answer that God created the universe out of nothing. But this is mere temporizing. If we wish courageously to pursue the question, we must, of course ask next where God comes from? And if we decide this to be unanswerable, why not save a step and conclude that the universe has always existed?".</blockquote>
<p>Just to quote the Bible on this one;</p>
<blockquote>n the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
<p>2 The same was in the beginning with God.</p>
<p>3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>
</blockquote><br>
Edit: Had to change the last quote up a little bit.
<p>I enjoy these conversations Niall.</p>

<p>Apparently being A god gives him the rights over our life because he created us, although I’m not religious.<br>
If god did create man he gave up all rights on us after we began to reproduce &amp; spread, though we kill millions<br>
of animals - not arguing that fact just pointing it out</p>

<p>[quote=“the elve age, post:17, topic:451479”][quote]Quote from Niall<br>
If you’re going down the “intelligent design” route, could you perhaps explain some problems with the “intelligent design”? Such as humans having a near useless appendix which can burst requiring people to have them surgically removed. Such as people having wisdom teeth that serve no current purpose, which cause people unnecessary pain and also require the person to have them surgically removed.<br>
[/quote]Evolution.[/quote]</p>
<p>I am fully aware that wisdom teeth and the appendix both have previously had a use, but not necessarily as having a modern use. I am also aware that the appendix may have a modern use.</p>
<p>The argument that I was trying to get at is that it isn’t necessarily intelligent to have such examples as wisdom teeth or an appendix, the wisdom teeth currently serve no purpose and many people are required to have them removed, the appendix can be removed without problems, and while very rare it has been known for people to be born without an appendix. The Intelligent Design theory argues that rather than means such as natural selection, an intelligent design proponent is required, hence slapping an Intelligent Design label on evolution does not many any sense, evolution explains the appendix and wisdom teeth while Intelligent Design cannot.</p>
<p>For the record I am not denying evolution, I consider wisdom teeth and the appendix as two of many examples of evolution, I do not consider them examples of Intelligent Design and I do not consider evolution as a catalyst of Intelligent Design.</p>

The bible claims that Jesus was born in nazareth, it has been shown through excavations that there is not and has never been a city on the site where nazareth is claimed to be.[/quote]It is speculated that there was no city called Nazareth DURING biblical time periods. Nazareth was started around the 70 CE period (around the time of the First Jewish War). Artifacts have proven it’s existence.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s contrary to what I heard, that the artefacts found on the supposed site of nazareth suggest the site was unlikely to be a city.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want to revisit this, I’m not particularly in the mood or capable of digging up sources right now.</p>

The bible claims plagues in Egypt (and was the bane of my childhood religious classes, seeing that I was interested in Egypt and knew that these claims were nothing more than fictional stories despite being 6), again this is demonstrably false as no evidence or historical records exist barring one book. [/quote]It has been proven that Egypt did experience plagues during the said biblical time period. Archaeologists do believe that the mythical ten plagues occurred in the ancient city of Pi-Ramses and they have uncovered evidence that leaves questions, as to why an entire capital just vanished? Stalagmites in caves have shown weather changes during the period, it is known that the Ramses environment was a warm, wet climate and had a dramatic shift to an incredible drought.[/quote]</p>
<p>I was under the impression that the only evidence archaeologists have found that would “support” the plagues of the bible was an example of how a chain of natural events could explain all the plagues of the bible. I was unaware that this was being proposed as what actually had happened. Again, please let me know if you want to revisit this as I am unable to dig up sources to clarify anything right now.</p>
<p>One thing I want to add however, the context of my original statement was that not everything the bible states is true or has been proven, the other example that I listed (which you neglected to reply to) was that of a global flood. There is no scientific consensus at all that a global flood ever occurred, there is no evidence to suggest that a global flood ever occurred, there is even evidence against a global flood occurring.</p>

<p>Not think in your head just this once, that God is real. Wouldn’t you think the death of the millions of humans that he himself created pains him, wouldn’t he hate to let his own ‘children’ go to hell and suffer eternal damnation of unimaginable agony. But God only makes one decision, he never changes his mind, he’s still the same God from the beginning of time, time doesn’t effect him.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I always thought that if god were real he would have to receive some sick and twisted jollies from sending people to hell. One issue I have is that there doesn’t need to be a hell, god could have dropped the whole hell thing and instantly would have been 100 times less evil for doing so, despite being responsible for some sicked up things.</p>
<p>Let me put hell into some perspective, if you do commit a crime in a finite world (earth), you will be punished for an infinite amount of time. You will never, ever stop being punished for this crime. Not only that, the punishment won’t be bad, it won’t be really bad, the punishment you will receive cannot ever be worse. So, for committing a crime you will be punished in the absolute worse way ever for all of eternity. There will never be a time you will not stopped being punished. Worse of all, the crime can be as bad as denying the existence of god.</p>
<p>So, when you say god is all loving I disagree. I say god is all evil for allowing hell to exist. God can remove hell and still leave us on this sick sad world and would merely be a bit of an asshole, instead we’re faced with hell which I think makes god evil.</p>

</aside>
<p>Being an atheist requires absolutely no faith at all. The only requirement of being an atheist, despite popular opinion, is that you do not believe in a god or gods. One could argue that you are in fact an atheist of the Muslim interpretation of the abrahamic god, or of the Jewish interpretation. You’re definitely an atheist of the hindu gods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, “because to believe that something was created from nothing just requires A LOT of it.” is a strawman argument. The big bang theory does not claim that we were created from nothing. It’s a gross misinterpretation of the theory, which I have explained before and do not wish to explain again when I know it won’t be read. If you want to know more though, please press 1.

<p>That’s not free will though. The problem with such a thing as free will is that knowing that you have free will means you do not have free will. Did they use their free will to not be flooded?

<p>[quote]But by all accounts in the bible god is not peaceful, take the story of the tower of babel for instance, a united man all speaking one language attempted to build a tower that would reach the heavens, god not wanted any of this gave different groups different languages so they could no longer cooperate. Whether or not you interpret this literally or not, it says something about gods character, he would rather divide (and conqueror) man rather than have man cooperate. </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You are correct in say God is not peaceful. God sent the Israelites to wipe out entire nations of people.</p>
<p>I disagree when you say God “divided and conquered” man. In verse 5 and 6 of Genesis 11 we read that God recognized they could do anything as one. I do not know God’s plan but I would like to speculate; God realized if man learned they could do anything as one, they would put themselves on a pedestal equal with God. God knows the heart of man, we read in Jeremiah 17:9 that, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?”. God knows that man is proud and boastful. Once Man proclaimed they were equal with God, God would have to destroy him. God didn’t want this, instead he chose to give each man a separate tongue.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not quite sure what there is to disagree on, perhaps you can elaborate it. Humans under a common language cooperated to build a tower to the heavens, god divided them by separating them to the corners of the earth and giving them a separate tongue so they could no longer cooperate, effectively conquering their plans.</p>
<p>But the whole story is hypothetical, one of my favourite quotes often attributed to Yuri Gagarin, - “I see no God up here”. We’ve flown to the top of the clouds. We’ve exited Earth’s atmosphere into space. We’ve stepped foot on the moon. We’ve sent probes to Mars. We’ve had man made objects (nearly) exit the solar system. If there is a god, he doesn’t exist within our universe.</p>

Then why can’t the followers decide on what should be and what shouldn’t be followed. </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you follow the Bible then you must believe in Jesus Christ (the son). That is a fact, otherwise you are not a Christian. When Christ was baptized by John the Baptist what happened? God came down in the form of a dove and said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</p>
<p>In John 4 23-24 Jesus says, “But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” KJV[/quote]</p>
<p>Arguably at least but that isn’t what I said. A definition of a christian is one who believes in the bible and follows the teachings of christ, and as such I consider anyone who believes in the christian god and follows the teachings of christ to be a christian, they don’t necessarily have to believe in jesus or that he existed.</p>
<p>The point I was getting at is that there are several thousand sects of christianity because they believe different things. You can be a christian and not believe in heaven or hell, you can be a christian and believe in heaven and hell. You can be a christian and not follow the 10 commandments, you can be a christian and not believe in angels etc. Christianity is merely a label that simplifies things, anyone remember the catholic-protestant war? If you guys went back to being catholics or protestants or whatever sect you belong to then there would be no unifying belief anymore.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It is a choice. God gave us free will to decide what we want. Why did he give us free will, why not just make robots? God only knows. We read in Matthew 7 13 and 14, Jesus says, “Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.”</p>
<p>The Father works in all of our hearts. He gives every single man, woman, and child an option to accept eternal life and many reject him.[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s really not a choice though, is it? Choose between eternal happiness or eternal hellfire, either way you will live in the afterlife for all eternity. What if someone doesn’t want to live in all eternity? They have no choice in the matter, no free will regarding that.</p>
<p>It’s semantics but I feel it’s important, it’s not free will if you’re being forced to pick between either outcome when other options are available.</p>
