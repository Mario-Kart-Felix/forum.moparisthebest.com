    <title>Adding points?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-points/218533</link>
    <description>Well i&#39;m trying to add my own version of castle wars, but there is one problem, i&#39;m not sure how to add points when you kill a player from the other team.  These are the ints for the points.
[code]public int Zamorakp = 0;
public int Saradominp = 0;[/code]

And this is under case 73:
[code]else if(plz.team == team &amp;&amp; incwars() == true &amp;&amp; team == 0)
{
sendMessage(&quot;Zamorak does not want you attacking your own players!&quot;);
}
else if(plz.team == team &amp;&amp; incwars() == true &amp;&amp; team == 1)
{
sendMessage(&quot;Saradomin does not want you attacking your own players!&quot;);
}[/code]
So it knows that you can&#39;t attack your own players.  This works in game, but this is only attacking other players, not actually killing them. 

Please help.</description>
