    <title>Server Connection error after set up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-connection-error-after-set-up/279466</link>
    <description>Okay I have done everything in my power to make sure I am not looking for help for no reason.
I have followed many guides to insure I have an understanding of how to get my Private server live but it just isn&#39;t working. 

I can connect only with &quot;Localhost&quot; and not my &quot;No-ip&quot;, it gives me an error which is &quot;Error Connecting to Server&quot;. Now like I said I can login when I change the ip of the client to &quot;Localhost&quot; but not to &quot;no-ip.biz&quot; (I didn&#39;t post my no-ip address for a reason).

I have also gown through my router settings and have added open ports for &quot;43594&quot; but seems to still NOT work! I am becoming frustrated due to the lack of help but hope someone will see this and be able to direct me in the right direction.
My no-ip application is ON also and I have the little simle face with the blushes. I have checked the box so its on and running.

In no-ip I have put my current ip address thats what I was suppose to do right? lol

Thanks to those who read this and attempt to help me out!</description>

<p>The reason you cant connect from your server ip is because you are the host, everyone else could connect if you port forwarded right, but you always have to use the 0.0.0.0, other players use the no-ip.</p>
