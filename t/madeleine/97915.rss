<p>So the person who actually took Madeleine is not responsible at all but it is all the parents fault? Yes, of course…<br>

<p>And yes ofcourse the person who took her is responsible i didnt think he wanted the answer that blaitently :)[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t think it is anyones place to tell them they are responsible for the loss of their little daughter. They probably have sat up every night thinking that to themselves and I don’t think they need people talking about how they are bad parents and all this shit. They have lost their daughter and that is the consequence of them leaving her alone.</p>
