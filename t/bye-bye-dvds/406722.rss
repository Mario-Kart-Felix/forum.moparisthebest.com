I&#39;m curious also how this will affect the distribution of Linux... almost all distributions use ISOs. There is Wubi (Ubuntu on Windows EXE installer), USB, Netboot, but I don&#39;t know of anything else besides those that can get Linux installed.</description>

<p>I questioned what point you were raising in quite a few of my replies. Again, you’re blaming me for discussing business now? You went into detail with that. I made a comment early on which you decided to take head on like I was trying to debate something. Like you said yourself - it was never an argument - only you treated it that way  ;D</p>
<p>This topic is about DVDs and how they might be on the way out, on a broader scale it’s about optical media and broader yet storage media, which broadens further still to technology, advancements in technology leading to the the removal of older technology from our daily lives. I wouldn’t constitute anything here as off-topic, as most of it actually makes for an interesting read IMO.</p>
<p>And just so you know I will always reply and address any point no matter how irrelevant even if only to point out it’s irrelevancy but more to try and educate the individual. Of course what’s relevant and what is not is rather subjective. Which is why if we wanted we could argue about this into next year. I think my last post concluded this discussion though.</p>

              <p>I stopped reading past; </p><blockquote>I’m discussing business and profit because it is a fundamental part of manufacturing.</blockquote> on this occasion because if you didn’t realise what I posed was hypothetical you’re being abundantly stupid now. If it’s assumed it’s hypothetical, please never make me cringe like that again. It’s an insult to both of us.
<p>EDIT: Read it because I am that courteous, again you make some fine points based around current business models and profit. Still single minded, I don’t deny any of what you say in relation to the current corporate status of the world, but your failure to think outside of the scope of our current world situation means you are the wrong person for this debate and I suggest you withdraw before embarrassing yourself with more irrelevant business knowledge that I’m already well aware of.</p>
<p>So I’ll address the main points:<br>
“I’m saying it is more of what they would lose if they’d release it now.”<br>
Precisely, in interest of profit, my point was this is tragic, and how awesome it would be if this wasn’t the case. How do you not understand that?</p>
<p>“people would just stop publicly showing their technology and patenting it.” In this world? No, they’d just sell the idea to someone else who can use it. They wouldn’t withhold it as that’s what they already do - except the patent protects it. If nothing is there to protect it then they aren’t going to risk shelving it while someone else can steal the idea. Bare in mind any employee who worked on it could switch employer and utilise it elsewhere if they had an idea for it.</p>
<p>“Perfect dream worlds” Do you know what democracy is striving for? Do you understand the developments we’ve made as a race in the name of hypothetical dream worlds? Are you mocking me for that? Give me a break. If you think we’ve peaked as society you are one naive individual. If the human race is too survive at all I think you’ll find corporatism will be gone in a few centuries, otherwise by that time we’ll have all killed ourselves for the imaginary money people like you seem to value so much.</p>
<p>Also, in case you hadn’t noticed, the article in OP is completely hypothetical.</p>

              <p>I’m discussing business and profit because it is a fundamental part of manufacturing. Unless you’re sat here making hypothetical dream worlds up where a business doesn’t need profit and everyone lives happily together sharing their technology, what you’re saying makes no sense at all. You complained about them holding it back to purposely profit later on, implying they do have something to gain from not releasing it now. I’m saying it is more of what they would lose if they’d release it now. You brought up profit, I replied to that.</p>
<blockquote>If they didn't care about profit they'd release it, or do you not see that? Do you not see the repercussions?.. If it's shelved there's no reason for pioneering research into newer technology - sure there is some - but there'd be a lot more if the bar was constantly being raised.</blockquote>
<p>A technology doesn’t have to be released into mass production for that. The research has been done, that can be built upon afterwards in other products if a business doesn’t see the need to take a loss and mass produce it for a market that doesn’t want it.</p>
<p>But again, unless you’re living in a perfect dream world, few companies would do that, they put money into research and development in order to later make a profit on it their products. If they had to force a product out into a market that wasn’t ready for it, or just didn’t want it, they’d be losing money on that. Then they wouldn’t continue throwing mass amounts of money into R&amp;D and then the bar wouldn’t be any higher than before, and in fact, it would probably make companies more cautious about their R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Competition raises the bar for new technology. Technology in a consumer or professional product that makes profit, it what makes other companies put research into makes products better than theirs, and also release <span class="bbcode-b">relevant</span> technologies, which HVD isn’t. So i’d argue that no, Lothy’s suggestion wouldn’t be best for the industry, now, I also don’t like how the patent system works at the moment either, but releasing people’s patents after a certain amount of time of inactivity (if they never did anything with them) wouldn’t be the answer either, people would just stop publicly showing their technology and patenting it.</p>

<p>I’ve never skim read any post. Clearly you do because once again you’re discussing business and profit. You’re so single minded it’s hilarious. Just stop trying to argue man your original post was irrelevant, because you think releasing something when demand isn’t there isn’t related to profit. If they didn’t care about profit they’d release it, or do you not see that? Do you not see the repercussions?.. If it’s shelved there’s no reason for pioneering research into newer technology - sure there is some - but there’d be a lot more if the bar was constantly being raised.</p>
<p>You mentioned the “business” market being “tiny”, again business and profit, the market size shouldn’t matter. If Lothy’s suggestion was implemented the businesses would still cope. If you’re going to continue to reply to my posts at least read and understand them first, I’ll even happily explain them to you just PM me on IRC or something. Making more posts about businesses protecting their profit when my original post was about how tragic it is that all they care about is profit is completely stupid.</p>
<p>All this because of a passive comment as well. Someone’s got a tiff.</p>

<p>The business market for this sort of stuff is very small, few would opt for using optical media for backups today, and the personal market for that use would be tiny. It isn’t worth massive manufacturing processes being put into place, building equipment to accept it and getting it out there.

Also, further showing the demand for high capacity optical discs isn’t there, Pioneer had the plans to develop <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/12/02/pioneer-shows-off-16-layer-400gb-blu-ray-disc-affirms-compatibi/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">400GB blu-ray discs</a> but given how it has gone completely quiet, one can only suspect they also realised there was no demand for it too.</p>

              <p>It isn’t just them trying to profit from it. It is companies knowing that there isn’t a market for it yet. By 2007 Blu-ray had been pretty much confirmed as the industry standard, significant investment had already been put into it and it was already out there.</p>
<p>Them bringing it out now, or then would have seen it flop. No one would have wanted to re-invest in anything like that, and Blu-ray is easily surpassing the needs of the industry now, HVD would be overkill. Now, I know the only use for optical media isn’t movies, but it is what pushes the adoption of them, it is what all these technology companies invest in manufacturing for.</p>
<p>By the time they’re out, optical media won’t be anywhere near as popular as it is now. Regardless of if you like the idea or not, it’ll all be downloaded or streamed.</p>

<p>The Holographic Versatile Disc (HVD) is an optical disc technology developed between April 2004 and mid-2008 that can store up to several terabytes of data on an optical disc 10 cm or 12 cm in diameter. The reduced radius reduces cost and materials used. It employs a technique known as collinear holography, whereby a green and red laser beam are collimated in a single beam. The green laser reads data encoded as laser interference fringes from a holographic layer near the top of the disc. A red la...</p>

Maybe we need to change patent laws so that something must actually be sold for the patent to remain in play; otherwise, the patent becomes open source. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
If something isn’t being mass-produced within two years of patent submission, the patent is released to someone else (or everybody) and they can run with it. Nothing would ever be put on ice again, imo.</p>

<p>In regards to most of the articles points they’re very true for us tech savvy lot but the rest of the world don’t understand that shit. Streaming and digital downloads has only just taken off in the past couple of years and I know of more than one university that asks for coursework specifically on disc. It’s like the floppy disk, they might be old and outdated now but we all have a few still lying around.</p>
