    <description>[b][size=12pt]Spawn Village[/size][/b]

As many of you may already know, spawn was once a horrific place to log in to. The place had been ruined by grief, new players creating shacks and then leaving and general lack of interest in the upkeep of it. Over the past few weeks, Kickingjamie and myself (aswell as contributions from others) have been working on making the spawn area a hospitable place to enter Moparcraft.

The land has been tidied up, grief has been fixed, gratuitous amounts of torches have been laid, plots have been set and base buildings have been constructed. However we feel it&#39;s time to turn this into a community effort. We are inviting every active member who has an aptitude for building to participate in making the current sparse area of spawn into a well kept village for all to enjoy. We are looking for your top creativity in this and there will be prizes for the best builds aswell as places for the members who contribute the most.

If you wish dedicate some time to build your own house in the town then feel free to post on this thread or contact myself or kickingjamie and we will be more than happy to provide a space for you to begin.

[b][size=12pt]Nether Hub[/size][/b]

When it comes down to it, the Nether is an extremely dangerous place to travel. With the constant threat of being fired at by ghasts, falling into lava with all your belongings or being swamped by mobs of pigmen it makes for an unpleasant journey from A to B. To combat this issue we have created a nether hub. Located in the ceiling of the nether it is a safe place for you to travel carelessly through the wilderness with ease.

This is also a way to connect the server together. With a central place for all members to come together it makes visiting others much more simple. At the spawn area you will notice a portal as soon as you exit the main spawn building. Upon entering the portal you will be taken to the central hub with four corridors leading from the main room. These four corridors are lined with areas you can build your own personal tunnel to your home.

If you wish to link your portal to the central hub, it is slightly different to the normal method of making a portal but is still quite simple. Take the coordinates of the portal you have in the overworld (x and z) and divide those by eight.

[i]Example:[/i]

Overworld coordinates: x:400 z:800
Nether coordinates: x:50 z:100

After you have done this, allocate yourself a tunnel in a corridor that is closest to the coordinates you have calculated and yourself a tunnel (feel free to be creative in your designing of this). Once you have reached those coordinates, build a nether portal and it will link to your original one. If at any point you have a trouble with this, contact myself or Jamie and we will be more than happy to help you link your portal.

[b][size=12pt]Spleef Arena[/size][/b]

Lastly, a spleef arena has been constructed in the spawn area. We plan to hold regular tournaments within it and of course the winner of these will recieve the spleef badge on their forum profile. This arena is also open for public use, however use with caution. The staff will come back every so often to rollback the snow therefore resetting the arena however if you use it and there isnt anyone around to reset the snow, then you will have to be patient until a staff member can visit.

[b]Please note this is a dangerous game, when you fall through, you die in lava. So do not enter the arena with any items you may consider valuable.[/b]

To begin a spleef game, set your spawn at the beds provided and walk through with only a shovel in hand. A spectator will close the door and pull the beginning lever which will set off a sequence of lights. When the last light flicks on the game begins and the last man standing emerges victorious. More information on tournaments and the like will be posted in the future.

Have fun!</description>
