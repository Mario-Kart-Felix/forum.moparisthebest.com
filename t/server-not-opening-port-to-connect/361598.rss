    <title>Server Not Opening Port To Connect</title>

    <description>Hey guys, it&#39;s a move ahead on my last topic.

I&#39;ve been looking at the ports and whatnot, now if the server is using port 43594, and it&#39;s closed, something&#39;s going wrong right?

I&#39;m not sure where it would be, but my run.bat file looks a little different from the other ones I&#39;ve seen ...

[code]
@echo off
title Server
tskill java /a
java -cp .;./bin; server.Server
[/code]

Can you guys check it? This is the only thing stopping me going LIVE! I have had a server on this network before, same router and everything, not RS though. But it required a port forward.

Thanks Guys

NOTE: Sometimes when I run it, if java.exe is not in the processes list of Task Manager, it will say:

[code]
Could not find process: java
Starting Relentless Redemption on 0.0.0.0:2222
[/code]

Surely it shouldn&#39;t say 0.0.0.0?</description>
