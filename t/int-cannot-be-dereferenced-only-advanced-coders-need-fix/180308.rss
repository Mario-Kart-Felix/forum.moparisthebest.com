    <title>Int cannot be dereferenced - only advanced coders! - need fix!</title>

    <description>Ok, 

So i need when playerX with id 1 has attacked playerY with id 2
and then in process it needs to check if playerY is still drunk or something else

so i need something like this
in attack case: test == plz.playerId
then in process it needs to check if the attacked player is drunk
if(timer == 0 &amp;&amp; test.stilldrunk) {
blalbla
}

so if the playerX attacks the playerY.
Then playerX stops attacking and then it needs to check if playerY is drunken

it gives me errors because it cannot be :
&quot;int cannot be dereferenced&quot;

is there a way to fix it?

[b]i knew this already:
From what it looks, you have &#39;test&#39; declared as an int (primitive type) and you can&#39;t dereference it with the . so that would be the problem[/b]

but idk how to fix it, that&#39;s the problem =(
[b]to what i need to change &quot;test&quot; theN?[/b]
[b]I NEED A FIX!!!!!!![/b]

i&#39;ve tried this:
client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[test];
with test = plz.playerId
then i changed test.stillDrunk to p.stillDrunk
i&#39;ve this but it gives no error but when i log in my client freezes
it gives me nullpointerexception????


thanks in advance
