During the first 18 years there&#39;s no evolution because the 700 people start with age=0.
Initially I wanted to make a program to simulate how overpopulation works but I got this result xD
It seems to grind to a halt at around 200-300 years.</description>

<p>Funny thing is that a big percentage of children that are born is due to underage pregnancy.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What we call underage now, was normal back a couple hundred years ago. The only reason we call it underage now is because thats what we are told all our lives. Its Parents telling us this so that we, as their children (even though Im 21), don’t have kids before we are out of school. Most of the time, if you have a child while your in High School or earlier then you will endup dropping out to get a job to be able to pay for said child to have diapers and things.</p>

<p>This actually sparked in my mind. Now I wanna create a formula for it. Oh my god… I wanna go to a new project now  :D[/quote]<br>
There’s no formula for it, the only way that a random number doesnt seem plausable is if you introduce age, body shape, their diet, diseases, war, etc etc.</p>

<p>I introduced HIV into the system in a very poor manor, no honesty or common courtesy for people with HIV, they just went about their normal day lol. Turns out the rate at which people ‘breed’ was much slower than I thought, and when you start with 6000 people, even though over 5k of them ended up with HIV (placed a &lt; instead of &gt;), it quickly died down to only 4-5 infections per year. Also made it (even though idk if its true) so that babies whos parents both had HIV would be born with it.<br>
Really didn’t take long for it to dwindle down to 1-2 infections at most per year (the number included babies born with it). To add a real population simulator would require a rather large amount of code, probably 10k-15k lines just to get everything in their correctly, because with War, you need countries, obviously a person in America cant breed with someone who is currently in China, all in all it would probably slow the process down alot. Would need a job for everyone (maybe?) for the recourse production and such. Just to much time to spend on a silly project IMO.<br>

Hence why I kept it simple xD The HIV system seems interesting O.O<br>
Wars require groups which require opinions and then you could have these opinions clash with eachother which would result in a war…<br>

Here is a little bit of the output. As you can see it still starts out with an amazingly high amount of HIV infected people, but they still don’t breed much for some reason. Nothing that I changed in the code to make that happen, just happens to be how your breeding system turned out to effect with people who have HIV.</p>

[/quote]<br>
How would I do that? :o<br>
Add a system that produces a set amount of food and provid that to the population?[/quote]<br>
Problem would be your food productivity would need to increase as the population does, otherwise your population will reach a peak point and come to a sudden hault.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m gonna let the posted code run for a few days and see how things turn out lol.</p>

Try it out and set the child limit to 7. You’ll see that it grows MUCH faster than it should xD<br>
40 - 50 is when the menopauze starts to kick in. So I decided to keep it low. Also, if I’d set it to 50 the growth would be more exponential.<br>
I’m +/- trying to make it how the world grows.</p>
