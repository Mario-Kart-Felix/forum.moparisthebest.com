    <description>I&#39;m using Whitescape source and when I tried to save it doesn&#39;t have my characters name in a text file it saves it in a .dat file and when I went into client.java and tinkered around with the &quot;load game&quot; void I added the folder that was necessary and it still didn&#39;t work can someone write me a tutorial or help me with this because I&#39;m getting pissed off and I really just wanna finish the rest of my server&#39;s things but that is the one thing that is stopping me. -.-
