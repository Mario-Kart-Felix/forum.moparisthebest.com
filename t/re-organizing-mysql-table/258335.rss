    <title>Re-organizing MySQL Table</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/re-organizing-mysql-table/258335</link>
    <description>[code]I was just wondering if there was a way to re-organize the contents of a MySQL Table. I know that you can have it displayed in a certain order by doing

[code]
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY name ASC
[/code]

as an example, if the table contained rows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;James
Alicia
Michael
Robert&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and i did that, it would spit out

[quote]
Alicia
James
Michael
Robert
[/code]

But is there a way to ALTER the table, so that the new order, becomes the default order? I am planning on using this in order for NpcDialogues for my server, in case you&#39;re wondering.</description>
