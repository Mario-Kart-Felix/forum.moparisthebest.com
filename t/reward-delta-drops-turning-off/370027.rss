    <title>[REWARD] [Delta] Drops turning off</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reward-delta-drops-turning-off/370027</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been having this problem for a while. I think I&#39;ve found the file which the problem is occurring. It may be in ItemHandler.class but I&#39;m not sure.

Every few hours the drops turn off. As in, you can&#39;t pickup items and when you drop an item, it disappears. 

I&#39;ve tried to get help with this before, but no one attempted to. I&#39;m willing to reward someone cash via PayPal for help that will patch this problem.

Thanks.</description>
