    <title>... And down goes Fagex.net</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/and-down-goes-fagex-net/22469</link>
    <description>Fagex has now become [URL=http://www.kwickfix.org/]Kwickfix[/URL]

[Quote=SeaSlash]I know you are all wondering whats going on. Well i&#39;ll tell you what has been happening in the past few days. It all started when Prodigy payed me 55M to update his website. I told him I would start after my Mid terms, essays and presentations I had due that week. He agreed and everything was going fine.

I was then approached by Stan. He asked me what I was going to do now that I had sold fagex. I told him I was not sure since I was busy then I remembered that I had an old domain called kwickfix and we could maby do something with it. He sayed he would host me so I thought I would make a sharez/warez/hacking forum.

I then go on fagex, once STAN installed the forum ask the fagex members for their help. Now im guessing Prod did not like that and de-admin&#39;s me then banned me. We then talked it over, we where both sorry for what we did and he unbanned me. Everything was cool then fagex was &quot;hacked&quot;. I get back and I was banned. I asked Prod why and he sayed it was Blue who asked to leave me banned.

Now for those who dont know.. here is the dirt on BlueFlames. Have you ever wondered why he always has rs2 GP? Well here is why... (He did not want you guys to know this, thats why I was banned) He hack&#39;s IPB boards, extract&#39;s their hash&#39;s and gets there email/password. He then gets there paypal accounts and scams people on sythe and ebay. He then sells it to you at a cheap price and never runs out.

Im sorry but I could not watch this happen and took back fagex. For those who say &quot;OMG you scammed, Prod paye for it.&quot; Umm actually he did not. He scammed JukuG and then gave me what he scammed for it.

So.. whats going to happen to fagex? Fagex is dead. It will be redirected to kwickfix for the rest of its life. If you dont like that, simple move on to blizzind.com. For those who want to stay, you are more than welcome to share our warez/sharez and hacking tools.

Thats all for now. I know some of you wont be happy but eh? Thats life.[/Quote]

Looks like it is gone for good.  So long Fagex.net.</description>

I didn’t like the fact that he was denying to be SeaSlash. He joined my forums under the name SeaSlash, the IP’s matched him on <a href="http://fagex.net" rel="nofollow noopener">fagex.net</a>, and he gave the same introduction on my forums(Steph, 17, firefighter…). And it was long before he bought fagex that he joined my forums so that’s pretty evident. Yet he still denied it for the longest time.</p>

              <p>Thats right, because eventually the person who bought it will run it into the dirt because they dont know what do. I say if you start something, and everyone gets involved in it, dont sell it. It just ruins everything you worked for. Like Mopar, dont ever sell your domains or site, please <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>Fagex has now become <a href="http://www.kwickfix.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Kwickfix</a></p>
<p>[Quote=SeaSlash]I know you are all wondering whats going on. Well i’ll tell you what has been happening in the past few days. It all started when Prodigy payed me 55M to update his website. I told him I would start after my Mid terms, essays and presentations I had due that week. He agreed and everything was going fine.</p>
<p>I was then approached by Stan. He asked me what I was going to do now that I had sold fagex. I told him I was not sure since I was busy then I remembered that I had an old domain called kwickfix and we could maby do something with it. He sayed he would host me so I thought I would make a sharez/warez/hacking forum.</p>
<p>I then go on fagex, once STAN installed the forum ask the fagex members for their help. Now im guessing Prod did not like that and de-admin’s me then banned me. We then talked it over, we where both sorry for what we did and he unbanned me. Everything was cool then fagex was “hacked”. I get back and I was banned. I asked Prod why and he sayed it was Blue who asked to leave me banned.</p>
<p>Now for those who dont know… here is the dirt on BlueFlames. Have you ever wondered why he always has rs2 GP? Well here is why… (He did not want you guys to know this, thats why I was banned) He hack’s IPB boards, extract’s their hash’s and gets there email/password. He then gets there paypal accounts and scams people on sythe and ebay. He then sells it to you at a cheap price and never runs out.</p>
<p>Im sorry but I could not watch this happen and took back fagex. For those who say “OMG you scammed, Prod paye for it.” Umm actually he did not. He scammed JukuG and then gave me what he scammed for it.</p>
<p>So… whats going to happen to fagex? Fagex is dead. It will be redirected to kwickfix for the rest of its life. If you dont like that, simple move on to <a href="http://blizzind.com" rel="nofollow noopener">blizzind.com</a>. For those who want to stay, you are more than welcome to share our warez/sharez and hacking tools.</p>
<p>Thats all for now. I know some of you wont be happy but eh? Thats life.[/Quote]</p>
<p>Looks like it is gone for good.  So long <a href="http://Fagex.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Fagex.net</a>.</p>
