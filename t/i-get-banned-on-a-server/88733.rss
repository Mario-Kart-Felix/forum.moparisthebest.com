    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-get-banned-on-a-server/88733</link>
    <description> :mad: I was playing willowscape.no-ip.org and i liked it so i decided to by a admin. I then went to owner and asked and payed 400k RS money. I then became a admin and i didnt no any of the admins rules for that server. I spawned many items like phats and dragon. I thought it would be fun to ahve a drop party not noing phats were forbidden in that server. so i got about 15 peopele to the bank. I then dropped many phats and barrows armopur and everyone was impressed. after, the owner came on and banned me. i started a new account and he said phats were forbidden i didnt have a clue and in most servers phats are allowd. No one told me that phats were banned in that server so the owner didnt give a krud about me and banned me. i loved that server and my best account which took a few weeks of hard time playing is all gone. what do i do? i really dont care about that server anymore so if u could ban it or try to get me unbanned from the server. thank you

Server IP: willowscape.no-ip.org
My admin name (that got banned): purple mage
Owner that banned me: str 0utloud

              <p>Wow man this person has no clue about moparscape in general… The only reason people should become admins are to BACK UP THE RULES. How can you do that when you don’t know the rules yourself… Pretty lame I think.</p>
