    <title>[VB6] Eliteclient 1.13 Source Code</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vb6-eliteclient-1-13-source-code/22040</link>
    <description>Yep, I have decided to release it as it has been about 4 months since I have touched it. :P

It is not too badly outdated, because I updated several things for you. 
Things that need to be fixed or updated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Autologout
World loading
The separate stat lookup page&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The world loading I have somewhat fixed. A few worlds need to be added and it should work great. (note: for worlds above 126 you might have to do some extra coding to fix)

Autologout just needs a change of colors. The statlookup panel on the main page is working. Amazingly, the bank pin enterer has managed to work the whole time. :)

NOTE: IF YOU USE ANY OF THIS, PLEASE GIVE ME CREDIT. :)

Just a warning- The code isn&#39;t very organized and is very nubby in some places. ;)

I will release a better bank pin enterer sometime as the coding in the one in here is shit. ;)</description>
