    <title>SethScape Age-ing System [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sethscape-age-ing-system-508/393185</link>
    <description>hello fellow rspsidians, im here to explain to you about an age-ing system im currently developing.

HOW IT WORKS:

the system uses booleans and static&#39;s and timer&#39;s to progress runescape real - time age-ing.

WHAT IT DOES:

In SethScape you create an account as soon as you log in it will create your profile with an age of 1 years old, and starts a real - time runescape environment. real - time meaning its counting the minutes you play to subsequently add to your age. 1 day is 1 year in SethScape . as you get older you become stronger, at 18 you will be able to purchase beer, high requirement weapons, join the army and increased strength and wisdom. as you get older to mid 30 - 50s your hair starts to get whiter but depending on how you live and what you eat, you can keep young looking. from 60 - 80 is the time you should start considering retirement, in relaxing sitting down and drinking good ol&#39; ginger i mean your old at this point decreased stability, sleepier , less strength and running requisitees. and sooner or later death... the average life for a sethscape player is 80 years old but as i mentioned it depends how you live and what you eat on sethscape, you will be able to live longer. the oldest age achievable so far is 120 years old. those who are at 120 years old are the finest and wisest but weakest players out there. you must praise your elders in remorse for they are old . when you are 120 years old you will be a god amongst men. Now if you die you will be bound to the 4th dimension to of which you are with other dead sethscapians. you will have to spend a couple of years depending on how well you do and maybe if your lucky you can get a ticket out of the 4th dimension back to the reality of sethscape. 

PROGRESS: 60% Complete

NOTES: got the base finished just need to finish the extras and add some more booleans to the ages 50 - 120

Comments are appreciated as ive spent a couple months already developing this i will add pictures soon.

HERES A CODE THAT TELLS YOU WHEN YOU&#39;VE AGED.

public boolean Age()
p.age = &gt; 1;
p.frames.sendMessage(p, &quot; you have aged a year, you are now &quot; + p.age + &quot; years old. &quot;);
p.frames.sendMessage(p, &quot; Remember to eat proper food to grow big and strong! &quot;);
}
}

The reason i didnt use intergers is because i found it creates improper functions, as booleans creates a more stable aging process.</description>

              <p>Hello, sorry for not replying to any of you guys, but after reading most comments ive actually decided to redo my methods as creating a more stable age-ing system, there project is now 80% complete, theres still some things im having a bit trouble with heres a list of troubles:</p>
<p>Proper food = good health<br>
Ages 110-120. (when it comes to this age it becomes glitched.)</p>
<p>thanks guys replys are welcome.</p>

[/quote]bool = 1 bit but making an arrayfull of them multiples this enormously, so having age up to 100- for say: 100 bits<br>
one integer = 32 bits and can intake 2147m values plus is more easy to use[/quote]</p>
<p>Exactly. A boolean can only be true or false. If you use an int, you’d probably do something like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void someMethod(int i) {
    if (i == 0) {// false
        doSomthing();
    }
    else if (i == 1) {
        doSomethingElse();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>What if the user enters any other number between 1 or 0? Nothing will happen. As you said, an integer can have approximately 4 billion values. What if you only need 2? You’re using 32 bits instead of 1.</p>
<p>Don’t be an idiot. If it’s a “true/false” type of value, use a boolean. It’s what they’re there for.</p>
<p>But, since he’s trying to use booleans for age, he should be flogged because age is a number.</p>
<p>Also: Would the age be based on the total time they’ve played/logged in, or days since they made the account?</p>

Using integers to return was can easily be returned by booleans isn’t smart. Why would you even want 49 booleans in the first place?</p>

              <p>hello fellow rspsidians, im here to explain to you about an age-ing system im currently developing.</p>
<p>HOW IT WORKS:</p>
<p>the system uses booleans and static’s and timer’s to progress runescape real - time age-ing.</p>
<p>WHAT IT DOES:</p>
<p>In SethScape you create an account as soon as you log in it will create your profile with an age of 1 years old, and starts a real - time runescape environment. real - time meaning its counting the minutes you play to subsequently add to your age. 1 day is 1 year in SethScape . as you get older you become stronger, at 18 you will be able to purchase beer, high requirement weapons, join the army and increased strength and wisdom. as you get older to mid 30 - 50s your hair starts to get whiter but depending on how you live and what you eat, you can keep young looking. from 60 - 80 is the time you should start considering retirement, in relaxing sitting down and drinking good ol’ ginger i mean your old at this point decreased stability, sleepier , less strength and running requisitees. and sooner or later death… the average life for a sethscape player is 80 years old but as i mentioned it depends how you live and what you eat on sethscape, you will be able to live longer. the oldest age achievable so far is 120 years old. those who are at 120 years old are the finest and wisest but weakest players out there. you must praise your elders in remorse for they are old . when you are 120 years old you will be a god amongst men. Now if you die you will be bound to the 4th dimension to of which you are with other dead sethscapians. you will have to spend a couple of years depending on how well you do and maybe if your lucky you can get a ticket out of the 4th dimension back to the reality of sethscape.</p>
<p>PROGRESS: 60% Complete</p>
<p>NOTES: got the base finished just need to finish the extras and add some more booleans to the ages 50 - 120</p>
<p>Comments are appreciated as ive spent a couple months already developing this i will add pictures soon.</p>
<p>HERES A CODE THAT TELLS YOU WHEN YOU’VE AGED.</p>
<p>public boolean Age()<br>
p.age = &gt; 1;<br>
p.frames.sendMessage(p, " you have aged a year, you are now " + p.age + " years old. ");<br>
p.frames.sendMessage(p, " Remember to eat proper food to grow big and strong! ");<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>The reason i didnt use intergers is because i found it creates improper functions, as booleans creates a more stable aging process.</p>
