    <title>Why having a Queen is better than a President</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-having-a-queen-is-better-than-a-president/101740</link>
    <description>George Bush is visiting the Queen of England.  
 
He asks her, &quot;Your Majesty, how do you run such an efficient government? Are there any tips you can give me?&quot;  
 
&quot;Well&quot;, says the Queen, &quot; the most important thing is to  surround yourself with intelligent people.&quot;  
 
Bush frowns. &quot;How do I know the people around me are really intelligent?&quot;  
 
The Queen takes a sip of tea. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s easy. You just ask them to answer an intellingent riddle. The Queen pushes a button on her intercom. &quot;Please send the Prime Minister in here, would you?&quot;   Tony Blair walks into the room.
 
&quot;Your Majesty.....&quot;  
 
The Queen smiles. &quot;Answer me this, please. Tony. Your mother and father have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?&quot;  
 
Without pausing a moment, Blair answers. &quot;That would be me!&quot;
 
&quot;Yes! Very good!&quot; says the Queen.  
 
Back at the White House, Bush calls in his Vice President, thingy Cheney.  
 
&quot;thingy, answer this for me. Your mother and your father have a child. It&#39;s not your brother and it&#39;s not your sister. Who it is?&quot;  
 
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; says the Vice President. &quot;Let me get back to you on that one.&quot; thingy goes to his advisors and asks every one, but none can give him an answer.
 
Finally, he ends up in the men&#39;s room and recognises Colin Powell&#39;s shoes in the next stall.  
 
thingy shouts, &quot;Colin! Can you answer this for me!
 
Your  mother and father have a child and it&#39;s not your brother or your sister. Who it is?&quot;  
 
Colin Powell yells back, &quot;It&#39;s me!&quot;  
 
thingy Cheney smiles, &quot;Thanks!&quot;  
 
Cheney goes back to the Oval Office and asks to speak with the President.
 
&quot;Say, I did some research and I have  the answer to that riddle, It&#39;s Colin Powell!&quot;  
 
Bush gets up, stomps over to thingy Cheney and angrily yells into his face, &quot;No, you idiot! It&#39;s Tony Blair!&quot;</description>
