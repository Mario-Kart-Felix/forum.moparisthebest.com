    <title>Player teleport through Npc dialogue problem [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-teleport-through-npc-dialogue-problem-508/433793</link>
    <description>Hello,
Ive been having trouble finding out how to get a player teleport to a location through talking to an npc. I want the player to teleport to the Servers Home area when he/she clicks on the option when in dialogue with the npc. I no its possible already in my server because in my server base BloodScape Bulby the npc Duradel as an option in his dialogue when you talk to him to teleport you to the Slayer zone. But when i looked through the code i was unable to find out how to replicate the code that made this happen. I did a full search through all my Java Files to find out how this was happening and all i could find was this[code]}

if(SlayerCaveTimer &gt; 0) SlayerCaveTimer -= 1;
if(SlayerCaveTimer == 0)
{
SlayerCaveTimer -= 1;
setCoords(2757, 3487, 0);
frames.removeShownInterface(this);
}[/code] 
I changed the coords and it changed where you teleported when you talked to the npc.
PS. i couldnt find any NPCDialogue.java within the files, its seems that Slayer was coded into ActionButtons.java
Npcoption1.Java, Npcoption3.java and player.java

Extra Info
Im new to coding and maybe this isnt a good source for me to start coding in, Id appreciate any links to a better source to start or a Guide to help me with this problem.
Thanks,
zader

PS:I might not be able to respond to any replies till tomorrow if more clarification is needed.
going to repost in 3 days if no replies.</description>
