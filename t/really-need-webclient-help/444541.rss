    <title>Really Need Webclient Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/really-need-webclient-help/444541</link>
    <description>Please I need help. I downloaded the Project Insanity source and client. I have followed all of the jarring tutorials and my .jar file wont even open. There is a client.class in there. And when I upload the .jar file to webs I dont know what the custom html is so I leeched one off of the internet. I have followed all the guides and whenever I put in the leeched html that I have edited it will just say error cannot find client.class but it is clearly in there. I didnt do any zipping or unzipping because I dont know how. But can anyone help or point me in the direction to get help.</description>
