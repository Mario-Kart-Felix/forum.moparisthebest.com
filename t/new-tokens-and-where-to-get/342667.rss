    <title>New tokens and where to get?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-tokens-and-where-to-get/342667</link>
    <description>I recently created a new shop on my server with tokens as a currency (because people were saying money is hard to make), but I&#39;m not sure how I should make them obtainable. I&#39;m going to make some NPCs drop them, but i figured it would be boring to just do that. I thought maybe a mini-game. Any ideas?

Thankyou in advance.</description>
