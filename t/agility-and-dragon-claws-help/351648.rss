    <title>Agility and dragon claws help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/agility-and-dragon-claws-help/351648</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m running a 317 and noticed there wasn&#39;t an agility course. does anybody know where i can get object id&#39;s for it or anything easier i could do?
Also, when i use dragon claws spec, its hitting only 2 times. Can someone help me making it hit 4? 

I have tried finding the agility object id&#39;s, but cant and i have no idea where to start when it comes to the dragon claws. Thanks</description>
