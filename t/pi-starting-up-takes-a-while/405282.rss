    <title>PI - Starting up takes a while</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-starting-up-takes-a-while/405282</link>
    <description>My PI server usually starts up in 5 seconds, and it still does. It will say online, listening with port 5555 but then when people can&#39;t connect for about 2 minutes. It does this after every restart. How can I fix this? I haven&#39;t recently added anything, but I was about to add castle wars.</description>
