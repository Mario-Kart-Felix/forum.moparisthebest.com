    <title>Does server need a tree farm?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-server-need-a-tree-farm/555108</link>
    <description>Not sure if anybody will remember a tree farm that I used to have back when there were 3 worlds all locked within 1000x1000. I had an oak tree farm with around 300 trees. I let anybody come for wood and even had a chest for free wood or sapplings. Only requirement was that if you cut something down you had to plant something back. I always make a tree farm within any settlement that I start (currently a man-made cave). Before I get too much going I figure I would like to know if there is a need for this kind of farm again. Back then since there was a limited land it was very useful.

PS: I am a theif of 2 full stacks of carrots, shears, and one stone axe. Just putting it out there.</description>
