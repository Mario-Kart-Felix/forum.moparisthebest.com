              <p>Can you give us some more information about your server? It’d help us provide relevant information to you.</p>
<p>Basically, this is how you want to do it:</p>
<p>When the NPC dies, there’s a method of some form that handles the item drops. Inside that method, you want to check if the player has a slayer task. If they do, check if the NPC killed is equal to that of their slayer task. If it is, use a random method (or similar) to generate the chance of the player getting a casket drop.  Check if that value generated is greater than or equal to a number you pick (Like player has a 1-100 chance, they need to roll a 98 or higher to get it, leaving only about a 3% chance). Again, if it is, then you drop the casket and send any message if wanted.<br>
Then underneath that you can handle the regular drops, if you want the player to still have access to those.</p>
<p>It wasn’t very specific because I don’t know what you’re working with.</p>
