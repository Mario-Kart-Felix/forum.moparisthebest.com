    <title>[req] Problem with dragon Claws and other errors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-problem-with-dragon-claws-and-other-errors/278363</link>
    <description>In my server Dclaws is automatically set for 60 def so i had no choice to change it to 1 def by changing dragon armour to 1def
Why?
Because My server sees it as a Dragon Defence armour
What do i need help with?
I need some help on how to make dclaws 1def without making all dragon items 1def
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And another thing, why do my models get messed up like 
i put anchor models which wasn&#39;t a .DAT file but it was a .File and anchors code into class8.java
then complied then saw my void top model got messed up it was invisible all you could see is a toy horsey on Ur self.
I think that i need to convert the .FILE to a .DAT Or its cuz of the silab model which got put into the Delta.



Thanks a lot.</description>
