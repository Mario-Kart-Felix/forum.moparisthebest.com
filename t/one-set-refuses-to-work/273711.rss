    <title>One set refuses to work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/one-set-refuses-to-work/273711</link>
    <description>Okay...Got most of my castle wars stairs up and running but...ONE of these freaking sets WILL NOT WORK. I made a command that teleports me where the stairs should to make sure it&#39;s reachable even...Yeah...Works....But...The stairs refuse to work, no matter what I try...

[code]	if (absX == 2425 &amp;&amp; absY == 3077) { //lower level
	  heightLevel += 1;
	  teleportToX = 2426;
	  teleportToY = 3074;
		}[/code]

&quot;case 4417&quot; is above that, along with a few more stairs that work with that code. And objectX objectY (Which I tried as well, failed. Took it out, still failed) It&#39;s the highest set of stairs in castle wars....Any help...Please?</description>
