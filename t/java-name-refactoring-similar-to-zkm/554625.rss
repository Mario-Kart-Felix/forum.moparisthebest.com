    <title>Java name refactoring - Similar to ZKM?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-name-refactoring-similar-to-zkm/554625</link>
    <description>Hi, was wondering - before I attempt to reinvent the wheel - whether there is anything that works how the ZKM unobfuscate method used to work? I.e. I input a jar file and it renames all fields/methods/classes and dumps the new jar? (Used to rename to aClass anInt aString etc.)

I would like to rename a jar that has been obfuscated with ProGuard (I think). I can&#39;t even extract the jar because the names are not valid on a windows OS. Aswell as that they use java keywords as class/method/field names.

I can obviously write something using ASM/BCEL, just wondered if there was something similar knocking around. I have tried searching but there is so much old crap to sift through it&#39;s quite difficult.

I tried using an old version of ZKM and the unobfuscate command but it fails. Some kind of class cast exception?</description>

              <p>Hi, yes I think there is. I’m not too concerned though as I have no major plans with the jar. I am not really going to be decompiling so the flow obfuscation is not such an issue for me.</p>

              <p>IIRC theres a pretty heavy flow obfuscation which is the bulk of the obfusication.</p>
