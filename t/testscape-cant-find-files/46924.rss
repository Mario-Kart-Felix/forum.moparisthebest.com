    <title>Testscape can&#39;t find files</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/testscape-cant-find-files/46924</link>
    <description>I have testscape, and I copied the stuff to the HybridScape folder (emptied first obviously) and then I ran the server to try it out, and I got this:

[code]npc.cfg: file not found.
npcdrops.cfg: file not found.
autospawn.cfg: file not found.
autospawn2.cfg: file not found.[/code]

I made sure all those files were in the location the java files were looking but it still does that.

I know it&#39;s a n00b question but I&#39;m just starting out and I&#39;m sure you felt the same way when you first started out.</description>
