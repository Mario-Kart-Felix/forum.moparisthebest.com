    <title>[PI] Changing the Items that the NPCs Wear</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-changing-the-items-that-the-npcs-wear/440866</link>
    <description>Is there a code that i can put in for the NPC so like E.g. A Archer wears a Magic Shortbow or Dark Bow, Besides a Standard Long/Shortbow? It&#39;s the same with the Armor/Armour as well Is there a code for that as well??

This is a request so if this needs to go to the Models help or what ever it is then please can a mod move it.

Also I am not going to do Modelling so the NPCs do wear it.</description>
