    <title>Changing the IP the client connects to?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-ip-the-client-connects-to/240684</link>
    <description>I have recently been messing around with the RuneScape client because I am trying to find hooks by using System.out.println. I have been looking in on how to do this and was pleased to find out that I needed to download the RuneScape client and change the IP it connects to.

My first attempt at changing the IP was by using the hosts file making localhost connect to 168.75.183.66 (world 37). However this did not work so I had to try a different way. I decided to try and use JBE to change the IP. So I found the method which the IP was in (this is in the client class) and changed it. However when I clicked save method I got some errors.

[img]http://i38.tinypic.com/2zf6av6.png[/img]

[code]
Error: Instruction requires an argument of type byte at line 10, instruction &quot;bipush&quot;
Error: Instruction requires an argument of type byte at line 72, instruction &quot;bipush&quot;
Error: Instruction requires an argument of type byte at line 97, instruction &quot;bipush&quot;
Error: Instruction requires an argument of type byte at line 102, instruction &quot;bipush&quot;
Error: Instruction requires an argument of type byte at line 131, instruction &quot;bipush&quot;
Error: Instruction requires an argument of type byte at line 173, instruction &quot;bipush&quot;
[/code]

I am now stumped for ideas so any help would be much appreciated.</description>

              <p>in assembler,</p>
<p>it looks as follows</p>
<pre><code>      CMP R0, R1 ; compare value in register zero, with the value in register one
      BNE jump
      ; do here what you want
</code></pre>
<p>jump  ; do after jump</p>
<p>personally, i think explaining it in terms of assembler is easier to understand,</p>
<p>in java code, that would look like</p>
<p>if(a == b) {<br>
//do here what you want<br>
}<br>
//jump</p>
<p>now when java is compiled into bytecode, the previous code block would look something like</p>
<p>1: aload_0<br>
2: aload_1<br>
3: ifeq <span class="hashtag">#4</span><br>
4: iconst_0<br>
5: goto <span class="hashtag">#7</span><br>
6:<br>
7: nop<br>
8:<br>
9:<br>
10: nop</p>
<p>which, optimised, would look something like</p>
<p>1: aload_0<br>
2: aload_1<br>
3: ifne <span class="hashtag">#5</span><br>
4:<br>
5: nop</p>
<p>so really, what im saying is, you can make the branch instruction what you want it to be <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>im high, i dont know what im saying</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>The problem is because you are still using the “old school” method of connecting a client.</p>
<p>As you can see in your JBE view (in the screenshot you have in your post), there is a “ldc 50000” and an ldc “40000”.  These values must both be edited to allow it to connect to the proper port.</p>
<p>Here are some basic instructions which <em>should</em> work:</p>
<p>Currently, that part of your client deobbed would look like this:</p>
<p><code>Class12_Sub26_Sub39.serverUrl = "127.0.0.1";
Class102.anInt1733 = 50000 + Class64.worldID;
Class12_Sub26_Sub32.anInt4482 = 40000 + Class64.worldID;</code></p>
<p>And we want to make it look like this:</p>
<p><code>Class12_Sub26_Sub39.serverUrl = "world53.runescape.com";
Class102.anInt1733 = 443;
Class12_Sub26_Sub32.anInt4482 = 43594;</code></p>
<p>So first, find the “127.0.0.1” and simply replace the push with “<a href="http://world53.runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">world53.runescape.com</a>”.  There is no need to use an IP like you have been.</p>
<p>Next, go to the “ldc 50000” instruction.</p>
<p>There are two important instructions here.  One is “getstatic vk/H I” which gets the vk.H field (aka Class64.worldID;) and the instruction “iadd” which adds the two values together.</p>
<p>So here is our code for the 50000 part:</p>
<p><code>getstatic vk/H I
ldc 50000
iadd</code></p>
<p>Now simply change it to:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ldc 443</code></pre>
<p>And we are done one of them!</p>
<p>Now go down past the “ldc <a href="http://world53.runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">world53.runescape.com</a>” instruction to find the “ldc 40000” instruction.</p>
<p><code>getstatic vk/H I
ldc 40000
iadd</code></p>
<p>Now change it to look like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ldc 43594</code></pre>
<p>And your done.  This should work.</p>
<p>By removing the two instructions, we are able to push the value without adding them, which is where your client crashed.</p>

              <p>[quote=“BAsh, post:2, topic:240684”]Basically JBE was not extensively tested and cannot load and save files that use integer constant in the range of 128 to 256.</p>
<p>When the file is loaded the instruction that loads 150 (for example) is output it is in a different format to when it is saved to a class file. Its got to do with 256 being the same as -1 as it wraps around. It is printed on the screen as a negative number but when it is saved it expected the negative number so it fails.</p>
<p>Its been a long time since I attempted to use it so I can’t remember the precise issue (sipush or bipush or both?) or even whether a negative or large number is printed on the screen.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to fix this issue. Fix JBE, its open source. Make a program to replace the large integers with two smaller ones and an addition or simply change it to an LDC instruction. Use another bytecode editor. Make a program to do what you would have done with the editor.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I tried replacing the problematic lines to LDC which did allow me to save the method but didn’t allow me to run the client. I also tried changing the problematic lines to sipush which also allowed me to save the method but broke the client. Secondly I tried using Cafebabe but that didn’t allow me to change the IP string into a custom string (it would only allow me to change it into strings that were already in that method). Your other suggestions seem a bit out of my league in coding, I’m just a beginner :).</p>

              <p>I have recently been messing around with the RuneScape client because I am trying to find hooks by using System.out.println. I have been looking in on how to do this and was pleased to find out that I needed to download the RuneScape client and change the IP it connects to.</p>
<p>My first attempt at changing the IP was by using the hosts file making localhost connect to 168.75.183.66 (world 37). However this did not work so I had to try a different way. I decided to try and use JBE to change the IP. So I found the method which the IP was in (this is in the client class) and changed it. However when I clicked save method I got some errors.</p>

<p>I am now stumped for ideas so any help would be much appreciated.</p>
