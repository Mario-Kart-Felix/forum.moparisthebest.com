    <title>writePlayers();</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/writeplayers/86656</link>
    <description>Ok, my server at first did not have at the top saying the amount of total players online, the name of the server, etc.

so i made the public void under the implement.

and i put this
writePlayers();

under the boolean process.

now i get the problem that it blinks repeatedly, and its really annoying, i tried to add it to the boolean like so:
[code]	public boolean process() { writePlayers();		// is being called regularily every 500ms
[/code]

but it didn&#39;t work, anyone can help me please?</description>

              <p>i’ve tried many different methods.</p>
<p>tried these:</p>
<p><code>	public boolean process() { writePlayers();		// is being called regularily every 500ms

<p><code>	public boolean process() {		// is being called regularily every 500ms
writePlayers();

<p><code>public boolean process() {		// is being called regularily every 500ms
writePlayers();
writePlayers();
writePlayers();
writePlayers();
</code></p>
<p>the last one just made it blink faster =/. do i add ints above the PBP? and yes i have the void public void writePlayers()</p>

<p>Make sure you have the void writePlayers() { then add this under PBP…</p>
<p><code>public boolean process() {//Is being called reg. 500 ms
writePlayers();</code></p>
<p>Like so.</p>
