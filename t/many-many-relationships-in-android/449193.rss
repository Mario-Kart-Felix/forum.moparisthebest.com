    <title>Many-Many Relationships in Android</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/many-many-relationships-in-android/449193</link>
    <description>I&#39;m working on a project that involves many-many relationships between object. My only problem is determining the best way to model them.

A little background on the project, it&#39;s going to be a kind of specialized knowledge base, namely the ingredients and potions in Skyrim.

Each ingredient can be part of 4 potions, and each potion has 4 possible ingredients that can make it.

I would like it to be as loosely coupled as possible, but if it boils down do it I&#39;ll make each Potion/Ingredient it&#39;s own class.

The simplest way I could see is to create a couple of tables for the ingredients and potions using a SQLite database on the phone.

For those of you that have worked with the Android API, what are your opinions on how to approach this?</description>

</aside>
<p>That was my initial idea. But then I figured it would be nice to search either (searching for an ingredient brings up the potions, searching for the potion name brings up the ingredients).</p>
<p>This would make it a bit awkward when looking up the “data” portions (ingredient enums). To look up the potions from the ingredients, it would probably look something like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for (Potion p : potionList) {
    if (p.getIngredients().contains(searchQuery)) {
        results.add(p);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>EDIT: I now see why I’ve been having difficulty. I’ve been trying to be too broad, as well as too narrow at the same time.</p>
<p>I think what I’ll do instead is create more of a wikipedia-type app, so that I can add pages, and add the content there.</p>
