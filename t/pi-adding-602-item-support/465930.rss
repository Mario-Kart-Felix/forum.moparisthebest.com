    <title>[PI] Adding 602 item support</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-602-item-support/465930</link>
    <description>I took the original PI source and am making a PK/Spawn server, which is going well but I just need to add 602 item support, and I&#39;ve tried everything... I know a server that has all the 474 data and such with 602 item support but I don&#39;t know how he did it, anyone?</description>
