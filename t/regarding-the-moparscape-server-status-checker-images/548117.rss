    <title>Regarding the MoparScape Server Status Checker Images</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/regarding-the-moparscape-server-status-checker-images/548117</link>
    <description>I recently registered my server on the MoparScape toplist, and I was given the link to my server status checker image. The server was on at the time, and for a while, whenever I checked the status image it said &quot;Unregistered&quot; instead of &quot;Online&quot; or &quot;Offline&quot;. I waited a while and eventually the image stated that the server was online.

At this point I thought &quot;Good, it&#39;s working&quot;, so I turned my server off for a while. Now that I&#39;ve come back to my computer, I decided I&#39;d check on my server status image. It&#39;s now saying that my server IP (delevationscape.zapto.org) is now &quot;Unregistered&quot; again, even though I registered it earlier and it worked.

As a result of this, I decided to re-upload my server to the MoparScape toplist and it now still says &quot;Unregistered&quot;.

Does this mean that every time I turn my server off, it will unregister itself from the toplist? I thought the idea of the status checker was to check whether the server was online or not and display an appropriate &quot;Online&quot; or &quot;Offline&quot; image.

What&#39;s going on with this?</description>

Says online.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, you need to wait like an hour for your server to be “Registered” the first time. And if your server is offline more than it is online it will remove it from the list and you will need to re-add it.</p>
<p>I think if your server is under 40% it removes it from the list.</p>
<p>So say your server was registered, that is now 100% uptime, and you leave for 2 hour it would drop to something like 33% uptime, which is under the 40% and removing it from the status page.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, it showed the image as “Online” then because that was after I re-uploaded it.</p>
<p>So basically what you’re saying is that my server needs to be online for long periods of time in order for it to stay registered on the server status page.[/quote]<br>
Yes. It is a way to clear dead servers from the list.</p>
