DiversityX is a pk/Economy based server.
There will be many updates along the way to make the server the best that it can possiably be!
DiversityX is in the Beta stage at the moment while I find and fix all the remaining bugs left.
I will be making daily and weekly updates depending on the importance of them!
I am currently working on a forums page! That will be updated as soon as possible!
Here is the link to the downloadable client for now!!!
