    <title>Need help with my Project Insanity base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-project-insanity-base/380252</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a Projet insanity base, [Lost legacy to be exact]
I&#39;m trying to open a shop, a donator shop. I have the shop spawned in the spawn-config, I have the shop in npc2.py, I have the shop in the shops.cfg file, and the npc is showing up and everything, its just when I click trade, the trade window is not popping up.
Is there something I&#39;m missing?

Help please? :D</description>
