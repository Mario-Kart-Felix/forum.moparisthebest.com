Their client is based off of that. You’re not going to be able to download and expect the same client.<br>

I would like the client to have the graphics and npcs that are similar to near reailty…thats all[/quote]<br>
Then download theirs and rip stuff from it.  It would take a long long time though considering how heavily it was edited and customized.</p>
