    <title>My first script</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-script/69478</link>
    <description>This script simply finds the client, I just made it all complicated.
Its my first one. I plan on getting really good with SCAR, I know java really well, so this was easy for me. It kinda looks formatted like java, so if it looks weird to you SCAR scripters out there, realize its my style of scripting with SCAR. Basically all it does is the &quot;ActivateClient&quot; procedure once, using an integer; then it clears the debug, I&#39;ve set it up so it could be a long script, by making a procedure called &quot;c&quot; to clear debug, so I dont have to write ClearDebug every time, and I can just use &quot;c;&quot;, Then I made it use the Writeln method to say that the client has been found.
Thanks for the amazing tut, Driger. I wish someone made a tut for Java like that, I had to learn Java the hard way.
I hope I can get good, I guess I can think of this mini-script as a solid foundation for a huge script.
Please post and tell me what I could to to get better, thanks :)[br][size=1]Posted on: March 20, 2007, 09:09:35 PM[/size][hr]Heres the code if you guys don&#39;t want to download:

I think I’m gona make a script that empties the recycle bin or something. Just gotta start small and master the small things because you can’t make big things without using small stuff. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
As for now, I don’t understand how the colors and stuff work.[/quote]<br>
Emptying the recycle bin is actually quite simple.<br>
The only stuff you need to know is:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">MoveMouse<br>
ClickMouse<br>
FindBitmap<br>
If…Then<br>
Procedures</span>.</p>
<p>That is really all you need to know to make a script that can empty the recycle bin.</p>
<p>Good Luck with scripting,<br>
