    <title>About GFX cards</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/about-gfx-cards/423110</link>
    <description>Well, I recently bought a ASUS Radeon HD 6670, but since it&#39;s AMD, the drivers are really bad and many problems occur, like screen splitting, right to left left to right etc. 
Oh well but I&#39;m gonna return it soon and I was thinking about a slightly more powerful card, I was thinking about GTX 560, but I noticed that cheaper cards have same memory and same clocks too..So what exactly makes it more expensive? And what would be the cheapest and best version of it?</description>

Well, I recently bought a ASUS Radeon HD 6670, but since it’s AMD, the drivers are really bad and many problems occur, like screen splitting, right to left left to right etc.<br>
Oh well but I’m gonna return it soon and I was thinking about a slightly more powerful card, I was thinking about GTX 560, but I noticed that cheaper cards have same memory and same clocks too…So what exactly makes it more expensive? And what would be the cheapest and best version of it?<br>

<p>I have that exact same card, and have no problems with it on linux, windows 7, or xp. The monitor could be offsetting the image form the card, and could be causing the problems[/quote]<br>
I lowered the clocks 20mhz(from default 800, 1000) and now it’s working fine, though I want more power still, I wish this card could be overclocked.</p>

              <p>I had an ATi card a while back, it kept screwing out. But that is probably because it must have overheated at some point in it’s life. So I just swapped back to my 8600GT - slightly lower performance, but greater reliability than that particular ATi (x1800 Sapphire I think?) card.</p>

I’m not a fanboy , the first AMD card I bought and its fucked up, makes me think that all of them are bullshit. And I did google the issue, and its within the bullshit drivers from AMD, and unfixable by myself.</p>
