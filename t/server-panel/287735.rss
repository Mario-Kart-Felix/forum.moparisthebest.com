    <description>Alright, dont be a noob and tell me to read the tut because of what the title says. I have created my own, used the tut. I like the tuts better because its self-updating. But it will not stay up. Same as if i created myn. Is there a way to make it STAY without puting it into a method format to make it repeatedly called, and make u be able to do nothing.</description>
