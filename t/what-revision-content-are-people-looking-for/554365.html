        <p>Frankly it just seems like whatever lets them feed their ego the easiest. I’ve been trying to get back into private servers on and off for months on end and the community ruins it for me every time.<br>
It’s never “Hey, let’s do whatever seems like fun at the moment and just have a good time,” it’s always “You don’t wanna DM or divine stake me? Fucking scared little bitch afraid to lose your pixels L0L.” At least until they lose all of their items where they just call everyone cunts and quit.<br>
I can’t just hop on a server and have a good time talking to people anymore, but maybe that has more to do with me changed as compared to the community.</p>
<p>Make it a 317 loading shitty 600+ models, that way whenever you try to implement anything other than a new way of gambling, people can just tell you not to waste time on fixing small or graphical bugs.</p>
