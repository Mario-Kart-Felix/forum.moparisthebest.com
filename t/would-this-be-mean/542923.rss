    <description>So a girl is sitting in subway, her and her friend are eating and she calls her work and says &quot;I&#39;m going to be late had to go get formula for my baby&quot;. Then after hanging up told her friend it is so easy to be late for work. So I leave and call her work *Wendy&#39;s* and tell them what she was really doing and said when I returned she was on the phone very upset telling her friend she doesn&#39;t work now ._.</description>

Enough of this 12 year old snitches get stitches crap, if you want to make a living, earn it. If you want a day off with a friend, earn it. Honesty is the best policy.</p>

Yeah I dont know her situation I think she was more upset because she was caught in a lie more then anything but as David stated if they did fire her from just what I said she clearly has had to have done more stuff then just this.</p>
<p>Again I dont know if she got fired or not.</p>

The only thing I would add is that a job like Wendy’s (or any fast food place) is a good place to be to make mistakes. If you learn to have a bad worth ethic at a starter job it’s going to haunt you later. Better to learn now. Also important to note that it’s not krackkid’s fault she got caught, if she has a tendency to lie and goof off she will get caught anyway eventually. And if she did get fired I will assume she has been caught before.</p>

<p>Just from my stand point I think you were being a douche but as I said you were technically not in the wrong but realistically regardless of what she did, it does seem like she cared about that job. I think wendy’s is a fast food place (?) so I can’t blame her for not wanting to go back to work when she was enjoying spending time with a friend.</p>
<p>I know this is fairly silly thing to say but in regards to things like this (assuming they aren’t major), mind your own business. You don’t know other peoples, you don’t know the negative impact you can cause by doing things like that.</p>

That think this kind of behavior should be accept, was it my place i would say sort of I have ate there before and saying she has served food that has hit the floor is kind of ridiculous.</p>

<p>My opinion is that this entire topic is you being an attention seeking brat, like most of your other posts of late. My opinion, like many others, is that you went out of your way to negatively affect the life of someone you didn’t know. Who on earth are you to judge whether or not they “deserve” their job? For all you know, they’ve worked late the past 5 nights and took a day off to finally get some rest. It is <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> your place to do that to someone else. Of course, you know that, otherwise you wouldn’t have posted this topic.</p>
