<p>So users talk about Darwinism, moderators talk about enforcing removal of children due to parents work ethics… but any discussion of the Nazis results in a +30 (moderation?)</p>
<p>No, sir, the moderators are perfect with their discretion. It definitely keeps the site fair.</p>

        <p>This post isn’t for starting a debate about how different threads are handled. All I was asking is would this be considered mean.

<p>My opinion is that this entire topic is you being an attention seeking brat, like most of your other posts of late. My opinion, like many others, is that you went out of your way to negatively affect the life of someone you didn’t know. Who on earth are you to judge whether or not they “deserve” their job? For all you know, they’ve worked late the past 5 nights and took a day off to finally get some rest. It is <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> your place to do that to someone else. Of course, you know that, otherwise you wouldn’t have posted this topic.</p>

<p>Maybe she’s getting paid for the hours she works. So she wouldn’t get paid if she didn’t turn up however she had to tell a lie so that there would be somebody to cover her shift while she was “busy”?</p>
<p>So you got her fired. She must have a kid ofc, otherwise her employer wouldn’t have believed her. Now she can’t afford to support her baby since she lost her job. Baby gets taken. Life gets ruined. Life’s over.</p>

        <p>Ashi there is no saying if she was fired or not. She might of not lost her job who knows, but you getting upset leads me to believe you’ve never had a job in which you had to pick up the slack of another or you are the type of person that is untrustworthy and unreliable. That think this kind of behavior should be accept, was it my place i would say sort of I have ate there before and saying she has served food that has hit the floor is kind of ridiculous.</p>

Or she is struggling too much with her child and needs a break.<br>
[/quote]So seems soooooo stressed. Laughing and bragging to a friend about lying to her boss to get out of work. Protip: if you have a child, just tell the truth and tell your boss you need a break.<br>

<p>Fast food bosses are, after all, known for how reasonable they are! After all, it’s not like they punish workers solely based on a phone call from a complete stranger, is it?[/quote]I too can take extreme examples and use them to justify making poor choices. The boss was okay with her being late to pick up baby formula, he seems like a real dick. He was being nice to her because of her situation and she takes advantage of it? Yea, this is definitely an unreasonable boss, not an unreasonable employee.</p>

You don’t know other peoples, you don’t know the negative impact you can cause by doing things like that.[/quote]I can agree with most of this post. The only thing I would add is that a job like Wendy’s (or any fast food place) is a good place to be to make mistakes. If you learn to have a bad worth ethic at a starter job it’s going to haunt you later. Better to learn now. Also important to note that it’s not krackkid’s fault she got caught, if she has a tendency to lie and goof off she will get caught anyway eventually. And if she did get fired I will assume she has been caught before.</p>
