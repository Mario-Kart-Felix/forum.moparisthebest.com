    <title>When an npc dies</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/when-an-npc-dies/58745</link>
    <description>i am working on a minigame where you are basically doing survival.. i dont want people to use the bank half way through so i need to get it so that who ever kills the npc gets teleported to the next place.

so far all ive done is added drops and when you do something with the drop you get teleported but they can just go bank then come back and the battles will be easy.  :(

does anyone know how i can do it? and what file is it in?</description>
