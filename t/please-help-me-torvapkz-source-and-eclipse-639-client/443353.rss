    <title>Please Help me! TorvaPkz Source and Eclipse 639 client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-me-torvapkz-source-and-eclipse-639-client/443353</link>
    <description>Hello everyone.
Well, I have been having issues lately with trying to find the ip. Can someone please help me? I searched for 127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/localhost and there is nothing. There isn&#39;t any tutorial that helps. Can someone do that and please show me how to jar it. I feel Lazy. 

Have TeamViewer
Skype:ali.abid331

Rep+++

                                           

(ps its my first time using a 600+)



*Edit:I found the ip on client but on server its not there. I dont see a client.java or server.java or gui.java. Im a beginner coder too. When I send client to my friend it doensn&#39;t work too to prove it. I want to jar it and possibly make a webclient. For the client if you want to see why it doesnt work. This is the download link: http://uppit.com/4vep2o1n94bb/Eclipse_639.rar. Don&#39;t extract to Desktop! Lots of Files!
I put it on torvapkz.no-ip.org. The client only works on my computer. I dont know why. I portforwarded and made an exception in firewall. Please help me!</description>
