    <title>Updates effecting SCAR?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/updates-effecting-scar/124520</link>
    <description>The updates that were made on the 17th, will that interfere with SCAR? Plus, the new random that is out, SRL Dev team will be busy lately as i just caught him and it is more advanced than the SCAR users think.

Concerns,
