    <description>Hi i was wondering how i spawn objects or what the code is to do this.

I know the ID&#39;s but im unsure as to what the command for it is and if i need a code for it.

Then i would also like to know how to save them spawned objects to the server so they will stay there.

P.S this is not ::npc, ::pickup or ::pnpc i want to spawn and save objects like fountains, bookcases etc...

Thanks

              <p>search makeglobalobject. copy the method, edit the first 2 numbers are the coords, the 3rd is object id. change object id to whatever you want, and coords to where you want it to be. the 4th is the face, edit to change what it is facing.</p>
