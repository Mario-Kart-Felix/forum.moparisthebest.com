    <title>Asking a question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/asking-a-question/234960</link>
    <description>I am posting this here, as i could not find a spot for this and since it is about asking Question i thought i should post it here.


Please Tell me if i should move this to another spot, It is not a tutorial.. Kinda :p



Asking a question is not as simple as asking for some codes or how do i do this..
There are a few things you should ALWAYS do before u start asking questions.

1, Use the search Bar!

So many people ask questions that have been asked a hundred Times and it gets realy annoying.
If you ask a question that has already been answered, you are most likely to get flamed or Maybe even Warned!

so Before you ask a question always, and i mean always use the search bar, i mean.. It is what its for :p


2, search around..
if you search for something but can find anything, you should try scrolling around in other threads that might have answers to your problem in a different Format. Example?
if i need help adding Real veng emote.
this is what i would do.


1, Search for &quot;Real Veng Emote&quot;
if i cant find anything i would go to step 2.

2, i would look in other threads, maybe there could be a tutorial that is called &quot;Adding emotes&quot; and in it, it could have the 
veng emote.
but if i still cant find anything, Step 3 should work.


3, Make a help thread. 
Easy, but complicated at the same time..

Asking a question is simple as typing words, but what words should you type?
Well the first thing you should do is introduce your problem.
Don’t just say 
[code]need veng mote plox[/code]
your not going to go anywere :l

But instead say something like
[code]Hello, and i am just looking for a Veng emote.[/code]

Simple ey?



But it might help even more if you put your reason. Example

[code]Hello, and i am just looking for a Veng emote
for my server, i think it would be a nice thing to add to my client.[/code]

So now if you read this. you should no how to ask a question with out getting flamed, spammed, or Warned!

Thankz
