    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/flappy-fowl-my-fangame-remake-of-flappy-bird/539944</link>
    <description>Hey Moparscapers, 

I made a clone of the Flappy Bird game since the [B]original got removed[/B] by its owner and cannot be downloaded anymore. I aimed to make Flappy Fowl [B]as similar to the original as possible[/B].

If any1 has an Android device, you can download it here: 

[url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thingymagic.FlappyFowl&amp;hl=en]https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thingymagic.FlappyFowl&amp;hl=en[/url]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/PSsJIOa.png?1[/img]

Please post your opinions of the game and any suggestions here into this thread and [B]I&#39;ll reply to every suggestion[/B]. Or if you think it&#39;s good enough already, you can rate it on the Android market.

Also feel free to share it with your friends - this is hot topic currently and I&#39;d greatly appreciate any publicity you could give me.

Thanks. :)</description>

Well surely the entire point of app signing is to stop people doing just that? I’ve never actually tried so I’m not sure, but I’d expect non-jailbroken devices to verify the certificate of an app before running it.</p>
<p>Obviously if something’s on the app store and someone uploads it, then yeah you can transfer that to your device and it’ll work fine because the certs are valid.<br>
[/quote]the code is signed with the developer’s certificate.<br>
if the certificate expires, whether the app is still in the store or not, the app will still be able to be ran/installed</p>
<p>as long as the app does not try to pull files from a non local database (such as pulling updates from a website/etc - mostly used in games) the app will be able to be installed at any time, on any device, as long as the codebase is up to par with the current OS</p>
<p>if you have the ipa for an app, you can install it any number of times to any device as long as it’s compatible with the iOS at hand.[/quote]</p>
<p>Google Play requires applications to be signed until 2033 (possibly 2034 now).</p>

<p>You can still install flappy bird on android if you can get the apk or if your iphone is jail broken.<br>
[/quote]you don’t need to have it jailbroken. you can down the ipa online and move it to your phone via iTunes<br>

Can’t programs like iFunBox install apps to the iOS? I don’t know if it requires the jailbreak, but it’s what I use to extract/replace files on my iDevice that’s jailbroken.</p>

Would you remove your game if people where addicted to it? Especially when there was already a lot of remakes of the game.[/quote]<br>
Read the damn internet then… and yes I would if I was in the right state of mind… And remakes? The game just came out and JUST starting getting popular… any remakes were made immediately after it was closed down…<br>
But, then again, if you don’t believe me… then I don’t give a fvck lol… I told you the answer so live with it and move on.</p>
