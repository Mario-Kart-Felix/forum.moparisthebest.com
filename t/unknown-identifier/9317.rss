    <description>Hi.

I havn&#39;t got a script fully working yet. I keep getting various errors, but ones really stumped me.

Line 157: [Error] (9166:4): Unknown identifier &#39;NewChatMsg&#39; in script C:\Program Files\SCAR 2.03\includes\SRL\SRL\skill\WoodCutting.scar

The line can be any line. And it not just &#39;NewChatMsg&#39; it can be &#39;processpicture&#39; aswell. Also not just WoodCutting.scar so far I&#39;ve seen AntiRandoms.scar and another I can&#39;t remember.

Any help would be appreciated and thanks for you time.</description>

<p>I looked through the all folders and back again yet no folder. So I ran a search and found the folder you speak off in the SRL folder as you said. The folder won’t show anywhere but in my search index. The PLACE IN PLUGINS FOLDER is completly empty too.</p>
<p>I put it in plugins anyway and the problem still remained.</p>

              <p>When you install SRL, did you ever think of looking at the files and folders?  Inside those folders is a PLACE IN PLUGINS FOLDER folder.  This folder gave you direct instructions… to place all those files into the SCAR 2.03 &gt; Plugins directory.  Do this.  ProcessPicture is then fixed.  As, most likely, is your other problem.</p>
