    <title>Server Problem ( Please Look )</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-problem-please-look/481186</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I downloaded a server from here and was going to use it for me and my brother to play on. I need some help because i&#39;ve been trying to fix this for a long time and was never able to.

( All credits to the original owner of the client-source. )

The source and client I used was - ( TrisidiaX V3 Client ) ( TrisidiaX V3 Source )

Now, I made everything right. Here is what I did:

1) Downloaded
2) Changed run.bat of source to jre7
3) Ran the server ( worked )
4) Logged in ( worked )
5) Logged out

After doing all this I knew I did everything correctly for me to log on. After logging on I when to client.java and changed the ip to what I had. My no-ip. So when I typed my ip in and then compiled it I started the server again.
But this time it was saying: Using the ip of: ( My IP )
Then I portforwarded my ip and it worked.
But this one problem came up when my brother tried logging in. We&#39;ve tried moparscape client and me making my own client but both failed. So when my brother typed everything in and tried logging in it logged him in than logged him right back off in a second. I saw my source cmd and it said he logged on and then deregistered. Please someone help me with this. If you need any more info I will answer it.</description>

<p>Well, the first time he was using moparscape client. It logged in than out. Next I created a webclient on <a href="http://rsps.org" rel="nofollow noopener">rsps.org</a> and it was appearing ( online ) so he tried that and the same error.</p>

<p>Well. The moparscape client won’t work for trisidia what so ever, seeing as it has a custom cache. and the mopar client doesn’t. I’ve never tried <a href="http://rsps.org" rel="nofollow noopener">rsps.org</a>’s. But I assume it’s still a cache error.<br>
From what I hear <a href="http://www.rswebclients.com/index2.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rswebclients.com/index2.php</a> works.<br>
Though, I suggest you get your own client working (the one that came with the download of the server)</p>
