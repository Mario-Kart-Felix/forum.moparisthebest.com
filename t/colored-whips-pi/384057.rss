    <description>Ok, so i have the whip model id, but when i wear it in the game, its curls up in my hand. I dont know if you know that i mean by that, but like in rs when you run with a whip, it curls up in your hand. I want it to dangle down like other whips. heres my id:


&lt;blockquote&gt;case 15441:
         itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
         itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
         itemDef.originalModelColors = new int[1];
         itemDef.modifiedModelColors = new int[1];
         itemDef.originalModelColors[0] = 8128;
         itemDef.modifiedModelColors[0] = 944;
         itemDef.modelID = 5412;
         itemDef.anInt165 = 5409;
         itemDef.anInt200 = 5409;
         itemDef.modelZoom = 840;
         itemDef.modelRotationY = 280;
         itemDef.modelRotationX = 0;
         itemDef.modelOffset1 = -2;
         itemDef.modelOffset2 = 0;
         itemDef.name = &quot;Abyssal Whip (Green)&quot;;
         itemDef.description = &quot;An abyssal whip colored green.&quot;.getBytes();
         break;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
