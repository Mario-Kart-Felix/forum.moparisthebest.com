    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/corruptionx-source-combat-problem-any-solutions-for-this/358648</link>
    <description>Guys I downloaded Corruptionx Source because it was based on the Caleum source.
So my problem is that I cant attack any NPC. I know this is an error on the source its self but how can I fix this?
Many other people have this problem too and the problem is only in this source. :|

The orginial corruptionx server its self has fixed this issue! :(
Guys I want this source this source very badly so dont tell me to change the source. Because this is the only source that I could find thats based on the caleum source and other sources suck. So please help  :D</description>
