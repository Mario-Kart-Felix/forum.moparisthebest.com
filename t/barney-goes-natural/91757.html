        <blockquote>BARNEY DOES BREAKFAST AND CHARGED WITH MURDER 
<p>Washington June 25, 1993 (PETER FUNK PRESS)</p>
<pre><code>  Barney the dinosaur, star of the children's television show
</code></pre>
<p>Barney, went berserk this morning during his show and ate three of<br>
his child co-stars.</p>
<pre><code>  The mayhem occurred in the Pretend Room while Barney and his
</code></pre>
<p>co-stars sang the song “Shoo Fly Don’t Bother Me.” In the second<br>
verse, Barney stopped singing and muttered that he had not eaten<br>
breakfast. He started staring at the children. Drops of saliva<br>
dripped from his mouth. His stomach growled. His eyes widened and<br>
pupils dilated much like someone on the third week of a radical<br>
diet of designer water and raw grass, who stumbles upon a<br>
cheesecake in a bakery window. Just as the children finished the<br>
song, Barney started to shiver. Suddenly, he just grabbed the<br>
children and one by one dropped them down his mouth like<br>
appetizers.</p>
<pre><code>  A fourth child only escaped because Barney ate the third child
</code></pre>
<p>too fast, and he bent over choking for several minutes, allowing<br>
the child to run away. Barney nearly passed out, but a fortuitous<br>
belch cleared the obstruction. He then stood erect, complained of<br>
a severe thirst, and asked for a double gin and tonic.</p>
<pre><code>  This all seemed very ironic, since Barney had just given a ten
</code></pre>
<p>minute lesson, demonstrating to children how to chew one’s food<br>
properly to prevent choking. The lesson even included a rhyming<br>
song with lyrics instructing children on the proper technique of<br>
the Heimlich maneuver. Following it, Barney gave a ten minute plea<br>
for responsible drinking among kindergartners.</p>
<pre><code>  Before Barney finished his gin and tonic, the police arrived
</code></pre>
<p>and arrested him on three counts of first degree murder, one count<br>
of attempted murder, and a misdemeanor charge of chewing with his<br>
mouth open.</p>
<pre><code>  The Public Broadcasting Corporation (PBS), producers of
</code></pre>
<p>Barney, estimates seven million children and 300,000 very strange<br>
adults saw the killings. However, it estimates that over sixty<br>
million people saw the show that night when many of its local<br>
affiliates broadcast the show again as part of their fund drive.<br>
PBS local affiliates claimed record donations from viewers during<br>
the rebroadcast, especially when the stations ran Barney eating<br>
breakfast in slow motion. They also reported receiving thousands of<br>
supportive letters which said, “Now that’s what I call culture.<br>
Keep it up!”</p>
<pre><code>  News of Barney's arrest shocked the show business world.
</code></pre>
<p>Barney comes from a show business family. His grandfather did stunt<br>
work in the film King Kong and worked as technical advisor on the<br>
film  King Kong Versus Mohammed Ali. Barney’s father played in the<br>
movie 1,000,000 Years B.C. and its sequel 1,000,001 B.C. His mother<br>
ran an acting school, which became famous for teaching iguanas the<br>
Stanislasky methods.</p>
<pre><code>  Barney began his career as a tap dancer. Later, he starred in
</code></pre>
<p>many Broadway shows in which he broke down many barriers against<br>
reptiles. He played Professor Higgins in an all serpent version of<br>
Lerner and Lowe’s My Fair Lady. He played Curly in Oklahoma in the<br>
first show produced and directed by stegosauruses. His music<br>
theater career ended though when he tripped over his tail during a<br>
dance scene in West Side Story. He received a severe head injury,<br>
and his I.Q dropped seventy points, giving him the intelligence of<br>
a learned potato. He had to quit the music theater but got a job<br>
playing himself on own children’s TV show.</p>
<pre><code>  Upon Barney's arrest, he hired flamboyant defense attorney
</code></pre>
<p>A.P. Hee-Haw Ripsnort to defend him. Ripsnort is a smooth, down<br>
home, southern lawyer who speaks with a New York accent. He wears<br>
Rhet Butler suits with a prostitute’s lace garter belt wrapped<br>
around his upper arm. In court, he wears no shoes or socks and asks<br>
beautiful jurywomen it they’d like to arm wrestle sometime. While<br>
cross-examining witnesses, he eats corn on the cob and offers<br>
prosecuting attorneys a chew of his tobacco. He specializes in<br>
defending TV creature actors. For instance he has defended Dino of<br>
The Flintstones, Alf of the show Alf, and Herve Villachaez of<br>
Fantasy Island. He became famous for successfully defending Kermit<br>
the Frog of the Muppets from a vicious palimony suit brought on by<br>
Miss Piggy.</p>
<pre><code>  Ripsnort said he would base Barney's defense on temporary
</code></pre>
<p>insanity, for only hours before the killings Barney had watched a<br>
pirate video cassette of the film Jurassic Park fifteen times<br>
consecutively. Ripsnort will make the argument that the gratuitous<br>
violence in the film Jurassic Park motivated Barney to consume<br>
children, a diet that even the American Pork Producers does not<br>
approve because of its high cholesterol. Ripsnort intends to<br>
present clips from Jurassic Park, showing dinosaurs hunting and<br>
eating humans, to the jury as part of Barney’s defense. He will<br>
precede the clips with a Bugs Bunny cartoon.</p>
<pre><code>  No matter the outcome of the trial, however, Barney has no
</code></pre>
<p>future on television. The Federal Communications Center (FCC)<br>
intends to ban him from public airwaves for eating children in<br>
daylight hours, a violation of FCC rules.</p>

<pre><code>This Halloween, I dressed up as the the Unabomber - hood, dark
</code></pre>
<p>glasses, mustache, the works.  I even had little brown curls to hang out<br>
the sides of my hood.  Aside, from comments of, “That’s not really candy<br>
in that brown paper bag, is it?”, the only eventful thing that happened<br>
all night long was that I was beset by a group of people who didn’t like<br>
everything the Unabomber stood for.  I was immediately beaten to a bloody<br>
pulp.  When my friends found me later, they berated me for my bad choice<br>
of costume.  Supposedly, they tell me, I should have been something that<br>
was a little more likable, more inline with unconditional love, to exert<br>
the idea of childhood innocence upon all I came across, if not enforce it.</p>
<pre><code>I'll be Barney next year.  Everyone loves Barney.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code></pre>
