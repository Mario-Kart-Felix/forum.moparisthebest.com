    <title>[PI] Standard and Easy Experience Lock with Command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-standard-and-easy-experience-lock-with-command/420311</link>
    <description>well I&#39;ve been scrolling through here lately and noticed that nobody has written an Experience Lock for PI. Since I wrote one last night, I thought I may as well give back to the community and release this, it is pretty simple but here it goes.

classes edited: player.java, playersave.java, playerassistant.java, commands.java
difficulty: 1/10 took me 5 minutes to write this at almost 2 A.M.
credits: 90% me as i wrote the code...its common sense tbh.
           10% sagi, sanity, etc. for writing the Project insanity base + the base i used.
reason for releasing this: wanted to give back to the community and help out :D

STEP ONE:
open up Player.java
under all the rest of the &quot;public booleans&quot; add;
[this makes the code always be read as false until proven true(which we will do in a minute)]
[code=java]
public boolean xpLock = false;
[/code]
save and close player.java.

STEP TWO:
open up PlayerSave.java
find the spot that has all of your } else if (token.equals
right before the break; of that statement, above the bracket, add
[this says that xplock is being read as a boolean and can be marked as either true or false]
[code=java]
             } else if (token.equals(&quot;xpLock&quot;)) {
                                                p.xpLock = Boolean.parseBoolean(token2);
[/code]

the code should now look similar to
[code=java]
             } else if (token.equals(&quot;xpLock&quot;)) {
                p.xpLock = Boolean.parseBoolean(token2);
	     }
		break;
[/code]

now search for
[code]
characterfile.write(&quot;
[/code]

at the very bottom of all the characterfile.write stuff, add(make sure that there is a characterfile.newLine(); above and below this
[this writes the xpLock to the characters file so you can see whether its set to true or false]
[code=java]
               characterfile.write(&quot;xpLock = &quot;, 0, 9);
               characterfile.write(Boolean.toString(p.xpLock), 0, Boolean.toString(p.xpLock).length());
[/code]

this should now look similar to
[code=java]
characterfile.newLine();
                characterfile.write(&quot;xpLock = &quot;, 0, 9);
                characterfile.write(Boolean.toString(p.xpLock), 0, Boolean.toString(p.xpLock).length());
characterfile.newLine();
[/code]

save and close playerSave.java.

STEP THREE:
now heres the part that actually stop you from gaining experience,
open up PlayerAssistant.java
once inside of this class, search for
[code=java]
public boolean addSkillXP(int amount, int skill){
[/code]

right under this, add
[this stops you from gaining any experience in any skill when xplock is true.]
[code=java]
        if(c.xpLock == true) {
		return false;
	}
[/code]

the entire code should now look similar to
[code=java]
	public boolean addSkillXP(int amount, int skill){
	if(c.xpLock == true) {
		return false;
	}
[/code]

you are now done with playerassistant.java so save and close it.

STEP FOUR:
now for the command, open up Commands.java

somewhere in your commands, add this command.
[all the command does is read whether xplock is true, or if xplock is false, and change it to the opposite.]
[code=java]
if(playerCommand.equals(&quot;xplock&quot;)) {
	if(c.xpLock == true) {
		c.xpLock = false;
	} else {
    		c.xpLock = true;
	}
    c.sendMessage(&quot;Your XP Lock Status is: @gre@&quot;+c.xpLock+&quot;.&quot;);
}
[/code]

well there it is, you should get no errors, but if you do please feel free to post them here.(I WILL NOT HELP WITH 100 ERRORS, THATS JUST COMMON SENSE)

this is probably more common sense, but still thought i would like to help out the community, if you use please leave a comment, leechers FTL. do not release this on any other site! if you want to release on another site, please PM me and i will give you permission to if i feel up to it.

you now have a working EXP lock for project insanity :D
HAVE FUN :D

<p>show me this exact code word for word somewhere else? yes it is mine so before you come on here and flame, let me stop you here. yes i realize its on servers, but people dont want to download a server to rip this and since no tutorial has been released on here for it, i thought i’d be nice and release this one.</p>

              <p>well I’ve been scrolling through here lately and noticed that nobody has written an Experience Lock for PI. Since I wrote one last night, I thought I may as well give back to the community and release this, it is pretty simple but here it goes.</p>
<p>classes edited: player.java, playersave.java, playerassistant.java, commands.java<br>
difficulty: 1/10 took me 5 minutes to write this at almost 2 A.M.<br>
credits: 90% me as i wrote the code…its common sense tbh.<br>
10% sagi, sanity, etc. for writing the Project insanity base + the base i used.<br>
reason for releasing this: wanted to give back to the community and help out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>STEP ONE:<br>
open up Player.java<br>
under all the rest of the “public booleans” add;<br>
[this makes the code always be read as false until proven true(which we will do in a minute)]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public boolean xpLock = false;</code></pre>
<p>save and close player.java.</p>
<p>STEP TWO:<br>
open up PlayerSave.java<br>
find the spot that has all of your } else if (token.equals<br>
right before the break; of that statement, above the bracket, add<br>
[this says that xplock is being read as a boolean and can be marked as either true or false]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">             } else if (token.equals("xpLock")) {
                                                p.xpLock = Boolean.parseBoolean(token2);</code></pre>
<p>the code should now look similar to</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">             } else if (token.equals("xpLock")) {
                p.xpLock = Boolean.parseBoolean(token2);
	     }
		break;</code></pre>
<p>now search for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">characterfile.write("</code></pre>
<p>at the very bottom of all the characterfile.write stuff, add(make sure that there is a characterfile.newLine(); above and below this<br>
[this writes the xpLock to the characters file so you can see whether its set to true or false]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">               characterfile.write("xpLock = ", 0, 9);
               characterfile.write(Boolean.toString(p.xpLock), 0, Boolean.toString(p.xpLock).length());</code></pre>
<p>this should now look similar to</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">characterfile.newLine();
                characterfile.write("xpLock = ", 0, 9);
                characterfile.write(Boolean.toString(p.xpLock), 0, Boolean.toString(p.xpLock).length());
characterfile.newLine();</code></pre>
<p>save and close playerSave.java.</p>
<p>STEP THREE:<br>
now heres the part that actually stop you from gaining experience,<br>
open up PlayerAssistant.java<br>
once inside of this class, search for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public boolean addSkillXP(int amount, int skill){</code></pre>
<p>right under this, add<br>
[this stops you from gaining any experience in any skill when xplock is true.]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        if(c.xpLock == true) {
		return false;
	}</code></pre>
<p>the entire code should now look similar to</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public boolean addSkillXP(int amount, int skill){
	if(c.xpLock == true) {
		return false;
	}</code></pre>
<p>you are now done with playerassistant.java so save and close it.</p>
<p>STEP FOUR:<br>
now for the command, open up Commands.java</p>
<p>somewhere in your commands, add this command.<br>
[all the command does is read whether xplock is true, or if xplock is false, and change it to the opposite.]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(playerCommand.equals("xplock")) {
	if(c.xpLock == true) {
		c.xpLock = false;
	} else {
    		c.xpLock = true;
	}
    c.sendMessage("Your XP Lock Status is: @gre@"+c.xpLock+".");
}</code></pre>
<p>well there it is, you should get no errors, but if you do please feel free to post them here.(I WILL NOT HELP WITH 100 ERRORS, THATS JUST COMMON SENSE)</p>
<p>this is probably more common sense, but still thought i would like to help out the community, if you use please leave a comment, leechers FTL. do not release this on any other site! if you want to release on another site, please PM me and i will give you permission to if i feel up to it.</p>
<p>you now have a working EXP lock for project insanity <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
HAVE FUN <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
