    <title>[317][Delta]Need help improving magic</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-need-help-improving-magic/312048</link>
    <description>My topic&#39;s pretty self-explanatory. Magic on my server works fine if you&#39;re autocasting a spell, but when you&#39;re just left-click casting a spell on someone, especially when you&#39;re doing it right after using a melee or ranged attack, either it won&#39;t cast, it will be delayed, or you&#39;ll run up to the person you&#39;re trying to cast a spell on from a few squares away.

I looked through MagicHandler.java, which seemed to be inherently related to this, but it simply handles magic (duh) and how much damage it can deal, how many runes it requires, and whether it heals/teleblocks/freezes/reduces attack.

I guess I have three questions:
Where is the behavior of your character (and whether he runs towards the person you&#39;re casting on or not) after you cast a spell determined, how is it determined, and how (just a prod in the right direction, I&#39;m not asking for a blow-by-blow demo, although that would be fine if you feel like it) could I possibly improve magic?

Basic information about my server: 
-Java (duh)
-cOmbattscape source (modified Delta)
-317

Thanks for your help,

              <p>Wouldn’t you be able to define the spells in MagicHandler.java and add code to make it stand still when casted (unless &gt;X squares away)?</p>
