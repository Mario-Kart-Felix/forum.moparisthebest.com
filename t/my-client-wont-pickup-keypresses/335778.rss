    <title>My client won&#39;t pickup keypresses</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-client-wont-pickup-keypresses/335778</link>
    <description>Well I am working on a client right now and I seem to have come across an issue, it won&#39;t pick up keypresses.
Basically all I did so far was disable drawing when not in focus(Cause it&#39;s a tabbed client) and wrap it in a JFrame, I don&#39;t see any potential reason why it won&#39;t register keypresses. If anyone has experienced a similar issue and can help let me know, thanks.

EDIT: I figured it out, the keylistener has to be attached to the tabbed pane then just only recognize keypresses when the client tab is in focus.</description>

              <p>In the Applet_Sub1 class the mouse and key listeners are instantiated in a new thread. Try removing them from the unfocused clients and reassign them to the active tab.</p>
