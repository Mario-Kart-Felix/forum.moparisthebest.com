    <title>The Perfect RuneScape Private Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-perfect-runescape-private-server/283173</link>
    <description>Hello somewhat people of MoparScape!!! (That was not to be taken literally. Just always have to start with an insult toward MoparScape I don&#39;t mean.) I&#39;m here today to discuss what the best RSPS would have.

I&#39;ve been having a lot of inspiration to do something with RSPS, which would include some entire remaking. I&#39;ve thought of redoing how the NPCs work, to add proper NPCs. This would include loading &quot;stats&quot; from the NPCs, like Strength, Defense, Max Hit, Minimum Hit, etc... And make them load from an [b]external non-Java file[/b] because having to do if(NPCID == *id*)hitDiff = misc.random(*); is just plain fucked up. This would also greatly improve combat, as it&#39;s very plain.

I&#39;ve also thought about making perfected skills. For starts, I&#39;d make Fishing, and then Woodcutting. Fishing would be easy; just a random delay and automatic NPC spawning and you have RuneScape&#39;s (I&#39;ve already made a Fishing base before, so don&#39;t tell me I can or can&#39;t do it.) Fishing. Woodcutting would just include global object making, along with a wide array of tree stats. In my mind, the only way to make it so it would work for any tree (Meaning every tree would work with its own HP and respawn rate) would make an array or list containing the tree HP via coordinate. By default in RuneScape, no tree grows upon another tree, so it would work. I&#39;m just worried about the speed.

Another decision I&#39;ve thought about is would it be a 317, or something above. They have their ups and downs. Personally, I prefer 474. It has the new game engine with no summoning, and a decent looking gameframe. 317s are ugly, have longer loading, an older engine, less of a world, and less features. However, a 474 has a bigger cache (size problems), while 317 has a smaller one. But if I remember correctly, the big size change in a 508 VS 317 was from the HD part of RuneScape.

Next up would be the world, and how you get around. Would the world be based around one small spot and other little areas used for other things (Eg. A home in EdgeVille and then a separate skilling area)? Or perhaps take a huge chunk of the world? Maybe custom terrain and just use that for the home and skilling area. Personally, I think the &#39;perfect&#39; private server would use most of the existing world, and try to make it just like RuneScape, with new things and much faster training.

Now this part is what I&#39;ve been waiting to really discuss. How would skilling be done? Right now, they all suck and are as basic as possible. Everything needed in to skill right now is in shops, or right in the open. For example, all herbs for Herblore are available in a shop, and Herblore doesn&#39;t even have timers. With Thieving, basically it&#39;s all in 3 stalls and possibly a man. Should it stay this way? I&#39;m thinking of having Herbs be obtained like they are in RuneScape; you kill monsters, farm, or buy ones that need to be cleaned. Thieving, like in RuneScape. All other skills, I think should follow in RuneScape&#39;s steps, perhaps with a few modifications if needed.

Finally, the last thing I&#39;d like to discuss. Customs. We all love &#39;em. You never play an RSPS now-adays without seeing &#39;em. Now, if the RSPS is a 317, I can see why they&#39;d be used. There&#39;s not many things you&#39;d like to see in 317s (For example, the only good armor is Dragon and Barrows. Boring.), and therefore I can see things like Bandos armor being added. But starting to add things like Dragon Whip, Green Dragon Chainbody, is just pointless. Things like Wings though would add an interesting touch.


Now that you&#39;ve read all that, and are reading this, I want you to type &quot;I have read everything in this topic, and this is proof.&quot; in your comment. If you don&#39;t, I won&#39;t take your comment seriously. An example of what I don&#39;t want to see is &quot;LOL MORE PKING OFC!!!&quot;.

So, I&#39;ve been thinking about making a development team for such a project if the comments come through and the plan is done. However, I won&#39;t be asking for recruits. The only way you&#39;ll be able to help when I haven&#39;t asked you to join is if you prove to me you&#39;ve made something else in another programming language, and actually know how to program. And one more thing: I got permission about a development team. If you want proof, talk to M.Dog311.

Erm... Discuss away!

<p>[quote=“sanga282, post:19, topic:283173”]a server that has its own unique story that a player can play through with people or solo[/quote]Sounds like Diablo’s concept.</p>
<p>Agreed with sanga though, servers have been trying to outwit eachother through features, and complication. No one yet has really put any story base behind their servers. Of course you have your halfassed “custom quests” but do any of them really add up to anything?. A pserver with a story behind it would be a great one to play.</p>
<hr>
<p>Since coding private servers, I’ve always thought outside the box. No server that I’ve ever taken the time that I have in putting detail into a server. Of course, it might not have been the most convenient way to code it when i did, but it was when i was oblivious to conventions and proper coding manner. More to the point, and not to be conceded, but looking back on all of the sources and remember my comments… I’ve come to realize they’re nearly all the same. No detail, nothing looks as if specific parts have been worked on for a long period of time. Yes, you have your sweet and valuable “Pking” and yeah you got your cool “steal from this stall and get 1mill thieve exp”, but have you ever thought of putting more effort into it?</p>
<p>The last source I tried working on to release, I worked on the home area… For a week alone. Think about what it would look like if you worked on the whole server like that. There was a control panel for a variety of things, accessible to admins and mods in-game. There were features that haven’t been on any server I’ve seen. All of this took such a long amount of time that I gradually lost the time to work on it. I’ve deleted everything (sort of an “OCD” effect I have with long term projects") because it’s a different time period, and time for changes. I left mscp for a while, and today when i visited I noticed this thread. Reading the OP, I’m totally in for this. Hopefully it doesn’t go to shit like past movement threads though.</p>

<p>On topic: I would agree with most of your statements relating to clients, some are a bit off, I like your general idea for this project though, it would be interesting to see develop in my opinion.</p>

<p>I honestly love everything you’ve posted. Maybe make new minigames for each skill to though? Like for WC, one of the most boring skills in RS.</p>
<p>Here’s the Mini</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">You take the highest leveled axe you can bring, and find an evil ent.
There are 7 types of evil ents. A regular ent (lvl 20), an Oak ent (lvl 45), a Willow ent (lvl 60), a Yew ent (lvl 90), a Magic ent(lvl 110), and a Cursed ent (lvl 130).
You have to have the WC lvl to cut the regular type of tree.
Once killed, the ent will give you 30 logs noted and a certain amount of xp for each.</code></pre>
<p>A little something like that, or a new quest could add alot of fun to a server <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Customs are not ‘cool’, even though they are heavily used in 317/377 clients here. Although, if you’re using 474, there wouldn’t be any reason to add customs as you would have [most of] the items you would want already given to you.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Hello somewhat people of MoparScape!!! (That was not to be taken literally. Just always have to start with an insult toward MoparScape I don’t mean.) I’m here today to discuss what the best RSPS would have.</p>
<p>I’ve been having a lot of inspiration to do something with RSPS, which would include some entire remaking. I’ve thought of redoing how the NPCs work, to add proper NPCs. This would include loading “stats” from the NPCs, like Strength, Defense, Max Hit, Minimum Hit, etc… And make them load from an <span class="bbcode-b">external non-Java file</span> because having to do if(NPCID == <em>id</em>)hitDiff = misc.random(*); is just plain fucked up. This would also greatly improve combat, as it’s very plain.</p>
<p>I’ve also thought about making perfected skills. For starts, I’d make Fishing, and then Woodcutting. Fishing would be easy; just a random delay and automatic NPC spawning and you have RuneScape’s (I’ve already made a Fishing base before, so don’t tell me I can or can’t do it.) Fishing. Woodcutting would just include global object making, along with a wide array of tree stats. In my mind, the only way to make it so it would work for any tree (Meaning every tree would work with its own HP and respawn rate) would make an array or list containing the tree HP via coordinate. By default in RuneScape, no tree grows upon another tree, so it would work. I’m just worried about the speed.</p>
<p>Another decision I’ve thought about is would it be a 317, or something above. They have their ups and downs. Personally, I prefer 474. It has the new game engine with no summoning, and a decent looking gameframe. 317s are ugly, have longer loading, an older engine, less of a world, and less features. However, a 474 has a bigger cache (size problems), while 317 has a smaller one. But if I remember correctly, the big size change in a 508 VS 317 was from the HD part of RuneScape.</p>
<p>Next up would be the world, and how you get around. Would the world be based around one small spot and other little areas used for other things (Eg. A home in EdgeVille and then a separate skilling area)? Or perhaps take a huge chunk of the world? Maybe custom terrain and just use that for the home and skilling area. Personally, I think the ‘perfect’ private server would use most of the existing world, and try to make it just like RuneScape, with new things and much faster training.</p>
<p>Now this part is what I’ve been waiting to really discuss. How would skilling be done? Right now, they all suck and are as basic as possible. Everything needed in to skill right now is in shops, or right in the open. For example, all herbs for Herblore are available in a shop, and Herblore doesn’t even have timers. With Thieving, basically it’s all in 3 stalls and possibly a man. Should it stay this way? I’m thinking of having Herbs be obtained like they are in RuneScape; you kill monsters, farm, or buy ones that need to be cleaned. Thieving, like in RuneScape. All other skills, I think should follow in RuneScape’s steps, perhaps with a few modifications if needed.</p>
<p>Finally, the last thing I’d like to discuss. Customs. We all love 'em. You never play an RSPS now-adays without seeing 'em. Now, if the RSPS is a 317, I can see why they’d be used. There’s not many things you’d like to see in 317s (For example, the only good armor is Dragon and Barrows. Boring.), and therefore I can see things like Bandos armor being added. But starting to add things like Dragon Whip, Green Dragon Chainbody, is just pointless. Things like Wings though would add an interesting touch.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve read all that, and are reading this, I want you to type “I have read everything in this topic, and this is proof.” in your comment. If you don’t, I won’t take your comment seriously. An example of what I don’t want to see is “LOL MORE PKING OFC!!!”.</p>
<p>So, I’ve been thinking about making a development team for such a project if the comments come through and the plan is done. However, I won’t be asking for recruits. The only way you’ll be able to help when I haven’t asked you to join is if you prove to me you’ve made something else in another programming language, and actually know how to program. And one more thing: I got permission about a development team. If you want proof, talk to M.Dog311.</p>
<p>Erm… Discuss away!</p>
