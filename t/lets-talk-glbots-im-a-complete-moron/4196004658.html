<p>It’s not really a new idea. A more prominent member of the community posted it a while back, but it may have been lost around page 4 or 5. Although, as I have always believed, things only happen when it is necessary. For example, before the nuke, we didn’t need to have an optical bot. We could just use the data in the client, inject our code, and get the desired output. However, since we cannot simply edit the client anymore, we have to resort so more innovative solutions.</p>
<p>It’s basic evolution really; adapt or die.</p>

Firstly, ‘optical’ bot makes no sense, color detection bots have always existed, and still do, and still work.  There’s nothing ‘optical’ about getting the graphics rendered from the graphics card…</p>
<p>And about a bot that “learns”, I won’t even start arguing into that.  The process of “finding patterns” in very possible, and is used, but it requires a lot of code by the user, and isn’t always 100% reliable.  Plus all that code can only applied to a specific application, there’s no “pattern” that applies to everything, it only applies to one thing, such as a grouping of similar models, and still it needs to make a guess if it’s correct.</p>

<p>What you two fail to realize is that I’m not talking about “color” based bots. What I’m talking about is using the models that are being rendered to essentially navigate the world. By using the models, you can tell where you are in the world. Along with the 3D rendering, you can also use the 2D calls to interact with the other interface components.</p>

I’m thinking we could, lets say for locating a guard to attack in a script, we could have the Guard’s vertex data in a variable in the bot/script, detect it being rendered by opengl, and then knowing where it’s located with the vertex data associated with the one being rendered.</p>

<p>Optical in terms of recognizing the world around you (or scenery).</p>
<p>As for the learning aspect, what would happen is there would be a base script (because you can’t learn about something without a starting point). From there, executing the base script multiple times, it would improve the execution, essentially learning how best to play the game.</p>

<p>Optical is does not exclusively mean “what the human eye can see”. Optical, in this sense, means what can be seen; and what can be seen is what’s being rendered on the screen; and what’s being rendered on the screen is being used to navigate, etc.</p>
