    <title>Anyone got a dognzb invite?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-got-a-dognzb-invite/471995</link>
    <description>nzbmatrix went down and i&#39;m crying like a little girl.. anyone got a dognzb invite I could steal? Cheers.

EDIT: Hmm them and nzb.su have both closed regs and removed all invites due to thinking their next, so I guess I&#39;ll have to wait.

Mortally wounded. Seedbox time I guess or back to the good old days of searching without an indexer :D</description>

<p>Nice thanks.</p>
<p>Also looks like nzbs.in is trying to hide their true nature. Now when you go to their site it shows “NewZBurnerS”. The true nature of the site isn’t revealed into you actually log in.</p>

              <p>Wow honestly I think this may have been single handedly the largest blow to usenet in awhile, nzbmatrix made everything so easy. Now the most recent episodes of my shows aren’t even getting onto usenet, having to resort to torrents still.</p>
<p>I don’t know whats going on with NZBs.in</p>
<p>Binsearch is all I’ve got left, it works okay but nowhere near the ease of nzbmatrix.</p>

              <p>[quote=“mwiebelhaus, post:2, topic:471995”]I agree. NZBmatrix was the place to go and i’m butt hurt over this. If anyone has an invite to a private site I would also be interested.</p>

<p>nzbs.in is a pretty decent yeah, not sure how new it is but its very slow atm due to the huge influx of usenet users with no ‘home’ now. binsearch.info still works but risky as ever, just be careful what you download there.</p>

<p>Well tbh the web indexers made usenet too easy and I think simpe APIs like nzbmatrix’s as much as i loved it made it a target for anti-piracy types. There was a time when i grabbed NZBs from IRC bots and back then when the community was much smaller we had much less takedowns.</p>
<p>Main problem for usenet is people like this:<br>
