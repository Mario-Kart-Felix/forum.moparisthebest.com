<p>Why is server advertisements any different to any other board? If you give constructive criticism elsewhere then give it here. I’ve had several complaints against you lately and it’s starting to annoy me. What does it matter to you if someone is leeching something? If that person released it then people are entitled to leech it. It’s not <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> problem. Like I said, if you have nothing constructive to say then don’t say it at all.<br>

Quite frankly, I’m sick of your attitude and if you continue to intentionally flame/spam there will be much more than a warning. I’ve pmed you before about this crap, now stop.</p>
