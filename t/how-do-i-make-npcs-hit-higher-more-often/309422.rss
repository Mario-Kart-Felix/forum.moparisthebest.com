    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-npcs-hit-higher-more-often/309422</link>
    <description>The npc i want to hit higher and faster is ID: 50 and it&#39;s KBD. It currently hits like a 40 every 6 or so hits, the rest are just 0&#39;s... How can i make him hit more often and maybe higher each time?</description>
