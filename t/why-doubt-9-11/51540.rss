    <title>Why Doubt 9/11?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-doubt-9-11/51540</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;   1.

      The impact of the planes cannot have caused enough damage to bring the buildings down, since the buildings were designed to withstand them (as Frank DeMartini, the project manager, has observed), the planes that hit were very similar to those they were designed to withstand, and they continued to stand after those impacts with negligible effects.
   2.

      The melting point of steel at 2,800*F is about 1,000*F higher than the maximum burning temperature of jet-fuel-based fires, which do not exceed 1,800*F under optimal conditions, so the fires cannot have caused the steel to melt, which means that melting steel did not bring the buildings down.
   3.

      UL certified the steel in the buildings up to 2,000*F for three or four hours before it would even significantly weaken, where these fires burned too low and too briefly at an average temperature of around 500*F--about one hour in the South Tower and one and a half in the North--to have even caused the steel to weaken, much less melt.
   4.

      If the steel had melted or weakened, the affected floors would have displayed completely different behavior, with some asymmetrical sagging and tilting, which would have been gradual and slow, not the complete, abrupt, and total demolition that was observed.
   5.

      William Rodriguez, the senior custodian in the North Tower and the last man to leave the building, has reported massive explosions in the subbasements that effected extensive destruction, including the demolition of a 50-ton hydraulic press and ripping the skin off a fellow worker, a report corroborated by the testimony of around three dozen other custodians.
   6.

      Willie reported that the explosion occurred prior to the airplane&#39;s impact, a claim that has now been substantiated in a new study by Craig Furlong and Gordon Ross, &quot;Seismic Proof: 9/11 was an Inside Job&quot;, which demonstrates that these explosions actually took place as much as 14 and 17 seconds prior to the airplanes impacts.
   7.

      Heavy steel construction buildings like the Twin Towers, built with more than 100,000 tons of steel, are not even capable of &quot;pancake collapse&quot;, which normally only occurs with concrete structures of &quot;lift slab&quot; construction and could not occur in &quot;redundant&quot; welded-steel buildings, such as the towers, unless every supporting column were removed at the same time, as Charles Pegelow has pointed out to me.
   8.

      The destruction of the South Tower in 10 seconds and of the North in 9 is even faster than free fall with only air resistance, which would have taken at least 12 seconds, which, as Judy Wood has emphasized, is an astounding result that would have been impossible without extremely powerful explosives.
   9.

      The towers are exploding from the top, not collapsing to the ground, where the floors do not move, a phenomenon that Judy Wood has likened to two gigantic trees turning to sawdust from the top down, which, like the pulverization of the concrete, the official account cannot possibly explain.
  10.

      Pools of molten metal were found at the subbasement levels three, four, and five weeks later, an effect that could not have been produced by the plane-impact/jet-fuel-fire/pancake collapse scenario, which, of course, implies that it was not produced by such a cause.
  11.

      WTC-7 came down in a classic controlled demolition at 5:20 PM/ET after Larry Silverstein suggested the best thing to do might be to &quot;pull it&quot;, displaying all the characteristics of classic controlled demolitions, including a complete, abrupt, and total collapse into its own footprint, where the floors are all falling at the same time, and so forth, an event so embarrassing to the official account that it is not even mentioned in THE 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT.
  12.

      The hit point at the Pentagon was too small to accommodate a 100-ton airliner with a 125-foot wingspan and a tail that stands 44 feet above the ground; the kind and quantity of debris was wrong for a Boeing 757: no wings, no fuselage, no seats, no bodies, no luggage, no tail! Which means that the building was not hit by a Boeing 757!
  13.

      The Pentagon&#39;s own videotape does not show a Boeing 757 hitting the building, as even Bill O&#39;Reilly admitted when it was shown on &quot;The Factor&quot;; but at 155 feet, the plane was more than twice as long as the 71-foot Pentagon is high and should have been present and visible; it was not, which means that the building was not hit by a Boeing 757!
  14.

      The aerodynamics of flight would have made the official trajectory--flying at high speed barely above ground level--physically impossible; and if it had come it at an angle instead, it would have created a massive crater; but there is no crater and the government has no way out, which means that the building was not hit by a Boeing 757!
  15.

      If Flight 93 had come down as advertised, then there would have been a debris field of about a city block in size, but in fact the debris is distributed over an area of about eight square miles, which would be explainable if the plane had been shot down in the air but not if it had crashed as required by the government&#39;s official scenario.

      There are more, especially about the alleged hijackers, including that they were not competent to fly the planes; their names were not on any passenger manifest; they were not subject to any autopsy; several have turned up alive and well; the cell phone calls appear to have been impossible; on and on. The evidence may be found at st911.org.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What the fuck is wrong with my country? When will the media start reporting the reality of the 9/11 truth movement, that educated and respected people all over the country are asking for another investigation? Maybe it&#39;s brilliant reporting like [url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Sep01/0,4670,Sept11Response,00.html]this[/url] that we need instead.

<p>What is there to disagree about? Some of the supposed hijackers are still alive. WTC7 was clearly demolished by explosives. The pentagon was hit in such a way to minimize damage, with no record of what hit it available to the public. We don’t know much about happened on 9/11, but we do know the government lied.</p>

<p>Today 17,000 local police forces are equipped with such military equipment as Blackhawk helicopters, machine guns, grenade launchers, battering rams, explosives, chemical sprays, body armor, night vision, rappelling gear and armored vehicles. Some have tanks. In 1999, the New York Times reported that a retired police chief in New Haven, Connecticut, told the newspaper, “I was offered tanks, bazookas, anything I wanted.” Balklo reports that in 1997, for example, police departments received 1.2 million pieces of military equipment.</p>
<p>With local police forces now armed beyond the standard of US heavy infantry, police forces have been retrained “to vaporize, not Mirandize,” to use a phrase from Reagan administration defense official Lawrence Korb. This leaves the public at the mercy of brutal actions based on bad police information from paid informers.[/quote][/quote]</p>

<p>The coalition of the willing? It was mainly great britain that sent troops. Other countries sent token forces or monetary aid. Personally, I think your missing the point.

<p>Mostly the US. Besides, I’d be more grateful if the UK said “Fuck you Bush!”.</p>
<blockquote>America is full of ungrateful people like you.</blockquote>
<p>America is full of free people, it is a nation of revolutionaries, people who worked hard to get where they are, and will fight anyone who tries to change who they are. I work my ass off, I have a full time job. I pay thousands of dollars in taxes, even though I’m a student.  I think you are making unjust and unfounded accusations against me.</p>
<p>Also, one of the founding <span class="bbcode-b">principles of America</span> was <span class="bbcode-b">not paying taxes for foreign wars</span>. How about <span class="bbcode-b">you do some research</span>, and <span class="bbcode-b">learn some history</span>.</p>
<blockquote>America is full of ungrateful people like you. Your ungrateful that you live in such good conditions and all you can do is complain about the government? People are starving and your fucked off because maybe some tax went up a little bit.</blockquote>
<p>Your so confused it hurts. Obviously I’m angry that people are starving <span class="bbcode-b">while</span> my taxes are so high, because the US could easily <span class="bbcode-b">end global hunger forever</span> with <span class="bbcode-b">a fraction of its defense budget</span>.</p>

<p>Wow thats just a little thing. Way more people die of other things. You think about your shitty US so much you forget about all the other soldiers in the world that went to iraq and are still going. America is full of ungrateful people like you. Your ungrateful that you live in such good conditions and all you can do is complain about the government? People are starving and your fucked off because maybe some tax went up a little bit.</p>

<p>You can’t blame him for being so interrogative towards the government. I mean if you lost a couple of your friends in an Iraqi siege or WTC wouldn’t you try and find out some answers as to who was responsible?</p>

<p>No,  it’s a fact. Opinions can’t be right or wrong, they are just opinions. Hmm, it’s almost as if I’ve purposefully mired your tiny brain into a semantical paradox in punishment for your idiotic “That’s your opinion” statement. Or maybe it was self-defeating and fecetious from the start. Why don’t you and your fellacious idealogy go back to <span class="bbcode-b">your mommy and daddy</span> who will tell you <span class="bbcode-b">everything is ok</span>.</p>
<p>Did you know George Bush Sr. was meeting with Osama bin Ladens brother on the morning of 9/11? Did you know they were meeting at the headquarters of the Carlyle group, a huge multinational global private equity firm, which the Bin Laden family invests in, and which has much to profit from a war in the middle east?</p>
<p>And many profited from the US policy changes after 9/11:</p>

              <p>Who cares if the government is lying? What’s done is done. No matter how many Loose Change Docs are done, no matter how many coverups are launched to debunk the conspiracies. All this is eventually leading to WHY the government did this, if they did that. I feel that would be a far better discussion than finger-pointing as to who was responsible.</p>
<p>BTW I already believe the Government is responsible for this. It’s either the highly persuasive Loose Change Docs or the work of someone very skilled in Video Manipulative graphics.</p>

              <blockquote>For anyone interested in a point-by-point debunking of some of the most popular conspiracy theories out there (like the fact that steel melts at 1525° C, and although jet fuel burns only at 825° C, it doesn't have to burn hot enough to melt to cause the buildings to collapse, since steel loses 50% of its strength at 648 ° C)</blockquote>
<p>Deadbird, I have already responded to that point. Number one</p>
<blockquote>      If the steel had melted or weakened, the affected floors would have displayed completely different behavior, with some asymmetrical sagging and tilting, which would have been gradual and slow, not the complete, abrupt, and total demolition that was observed.</blockquote>
<p>Number Two:</p>
<blockquote>      UL certified the steel in the buildings up to 2,000*F for three or four hours before it would even significantly weaken, where these fires burned too low and too briefly at an average temperature of around 500*F--about one hour in the South Tower and one and a half in the North--to have even caused the steel to weaken, much less melt.</blockquote>
<p>Number Three:</p>
<blockquote>      Heavy steel construction buildings like the Twin Towers, built with more than 100,000 tons of steel, are not even capable of "pancake collapse", which normally only occurs with concrete structures of "lift slab" construction and could not occur in "redundant" welded-steel buildings, such as the towers, unless every supporting column were removed at the same time, as Charles Pegelow has pointed out to me.</blockquote>
<p>However, the main point I’m trying to make is: The government <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/wot/571-page-lie.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">lied</a> and they continute to lie.</p>
<blockquote>, and this http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, well, they don’t appear to know anything about building 7:</p>
<blockquote>NOTE: The NIST investigation of the WTC 7 building collapse is not yet complete. The report on the WTC 7 collapse investigation will be released in draft form for public comment and posted on this web site as soon as it is available.</blockquote>
<p>The NIST is full of shit, sorry.<br>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Oh, Sorry, here’s some evidence I recovered from ye olde Xerxes 9/11 thread:</p>
<p>“OMGZ! There was a pod underneath the plane!!! Its a missile/bomb!!!”</p>
<p>Answer - The most clearest shots of the 173 plane was taken by Rob Howard. This high res picture was sent to Ronald Greeley, director of the Space Photography Laboratory at Arizona State University. Greely dismissed the notion of the missile. What was visible was  the Boeing’s right fairing, a pronounced bulge that contains the landing gear. He also conluded that light reflecting off it gave it an exagerated look.</p>
<p>Claim - "No fighter jets were scrambled from any of the 28 Air Force bases within close range of the four hijacked flights. “On 11 September Andrews had two squadrons of fighter jets with the job of protecting the skies over Washington D.C.,” says the Web site <a href="http://emperors-clothes.com" rel="nofollow noopener">emperors-clothes.com</a>. “They failed to do their job.” “There is only one explanation for this,” writes Mark R. Elsis of <a href="http://StandDown.net" rel="nofollow noopener">StandDown.net</a>. “Our Air Force was ordered to Stand Down on 9/11.”</p>
<p>Answer - On 9/11 there were only 14 fighter jets on alert in the contiguous 48 states. No computer network or alarm automatically alerted the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) of missing planes. “They [civilian Air Traffic Control, or ATC] had to pick up the phone and literally dial us,” says Maj. Douglas Martin, public affairs officer for NORAD. Boston Center, one of 22 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regional ATC facilities, called NORAD’s Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) three times: at 8:37 am EST to inform NEADS that Flight 11 was hijacked; at 9:21 am to inform the agency, mistakenly, that Flight 11 was headed for Washington (the plane had hit the North Tower 35 minutes earlier); and at 9:41 am to (erroneously) identify Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 from Boston as a possible hijacking. The New York ATC called NEADS at 9:03 am to report that United Flight 175 had been hijacked–the same time the plane slammed into the South Tower. Within minutes of that first call from Boston Center, NEADS scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air Force Base in Falmouth, Mass., and three F-16s from Langley Air National Guard Base in Hampton, Va. None of the fighters got anywhere near the pirated planes.</p>
<p>Claim - "On Sept. 11, FOX News broadcast a live phone interview with FOX employee Marc Birnbach. <a href="http://911inplanesite.com" rel="nofollow noopener">911inplanesite.com</a> states that “Bernback” saw the plane “crash into the South Tower.” “It definitely did not look like a commercial plane,” Birnbach said on air. “I didn’t see any windows on the sides.”</p>
<p>Coupled with photographs and videos of Flight 175 that lack the resolution to show windows, Birnbach’s statement has fueled one of the most widely referenced 9/11 conspiracy theories–specifically, that the South Tower was struck by a military cargo plane or a fuel tanker."</p>
<p>Answer - Birnbach, who was a freelance videographer with FOX News at the time, tells PM that he was more than 2 miles southeast of the WTC, in Brooklyn, when he briefly saw a plane fly over. He says that, in fact, he did not see the plane strike the South Tower; he says he only heard the explosion.</p>
<p>While heading a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) probe into the collapse of the towers, W. Gene Corley studied the airplane wreckage. A licensed structural engineer with Construction Technology Laboratories, a consulting firm based in Skokie, Ill., Corley and his team photographed aircraft debris on the roof of WTC 5, including a chunk of fuselage that clearly had passenger windows. “It’s … from the United Airlines plane that hit Tower 2,” Corley states flatly. In reviewing crash footage taken by an ABC news crew, Corley was able to track the trajectory of the fragments he studied–including a section of the landing gear and part of an engine–as they tore through the South Tower, exited from the building’s north side and fell from the sky.</p>
<p>A picture of windowed debre <a href="http://imageshack.us" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img133.imageshack.us/img133/4003/0305911windowssm3na.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Now, there are about 11 pages of answering your crap up on the site: <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=3&amp;c=y" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=3&amp;c=y</a></p>
<p>This proves, with evidence, that you are wrong. Alex Jones’ videos are made for brainwashing. They make you look at evidence which you cannot dispute. I used to believe that. I actually used to think that the Government killed thousands of people. I talked to my parents about it, and they almost changed my mind. I went to certain sites that debunk the idea, and after reading a few hundred pages, I was finally convinced that this theory was made for publicity.</p>
