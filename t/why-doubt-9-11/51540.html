<pre><code>  The impact of the planes cannot have caused enough damage to bring the buildings down, since the buildings were designed to withstand them (as Frank DeMartini, the project manager, has observed), the planes that hit were very similar to those they were designed to withstand, and they continued to stand after those impacts with negligible effects.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  The melting point of steel at 2,800*F is about 1,000*F higher than the maximum burning temperature of jet-fuel-based fires, which do not exceed 1,800*F under optimal conditions, so the fires cannot have caused the steel to melt, which means that melting steel did not bring the buildings down.
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  UL certified the steel in the buildings up to 2,000*F for three or four hours before it would even significantly weaken, where these fires burned too low and too briefly at an average temperature of around 500*F--about one hour in the South Tower and one and a half in the North--to have even caused the steel to weaken, much less melt.
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  If the steel had melted or weakened, the affected floors would have displayed completely different behavior, with some asymmetrical sagging and tilting, which would have been gradual and slow, not the complete, abrupt, and total demolition that was observed.
</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  William Rodriguez, the senior custodian in the North Tower and the last man to leave the building, has reported massive explosions in the subbasements that effected extensive destruction, including the demolition of a 50-ton hydraulic press and ripping the skin off a fellow worker, a report corroborated by the testimony of around three dozen other custodians.
</code></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  Willie reported that the explosion occurred prior to the airplane's impact, a claim that has now been substantiated in a new study by Craig Furlong and Gordon Ross, "Seismic Proof: 9/11 was an Inside Job", which demonstrates that these explosions actually took place as much as 14 and 17 seconds prior to the airplanes impacts.
</code></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  Heavy steel construction buildings like the Twin Towers, built with more than 100,000 tons of steel, are not even capable of "pancake collapse", which normally only occurs with concrete structures of "lift slab" construction and could not occur in "redundant" welded-steel buildings, such as the towers, unless every supporting column were removed at the same time, as Charles Pegelow has pointed out to me.
</code></pre>
<ol start="8">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  The destruction of the South Tower in 10 seconds and of the North in 9 is even faster than free fall with only air resistance, which would have taken at least 12 seconds, which, as Judy Wood has emphasized, is an astounding result that would have been impossible without extremely powerful explosives.
</code></pre>
<ol start="9">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  The towers are exploding from the top, not collapsing to the ground, where the floors do not move, a phenomenon that Judy Wood has likened to two gigantic trees turning to sawdust from the top down, which, like the pulverization of the concrete, the official account cannot possibly explain.
</code></pre>
<ol start="10">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  Pools of molten metal were found at the subbasement levels three, four, and five weeks later, an effect that could not have been produced by the plane-impact/jet-fuel-fire/pancake collapse scenario, which, of course, implies that it was not produced by such a cause.
</code></pre>
<ol start="11">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  WTC-7 came down in a classic controlled demolition at 5:20 PM/ET after Larry Silverstein suggested the best thing to do might be to "pull it", displaying all the characteristics of classic controlled demolitions, including a complete, abrupt, and total collapse into its own footprint, where the floors are all falling at the same time, and so forth, an event so embarrassing to the official account that it is not even mentioned in THE 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT.
</code></pre>
<ol start="12">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  The hit point at the Pentagon was too small to accommodate a 100-ton airliner with a 125-foot wingspan and a tail that stands 44 feet above the ground; the kind and quantity of debris was wrong for a Boeing 757: no wings, no fuselage, no seats, no bodies, no luggage, no tail! Which means that the building was not hit by a Boeing 757!
</code></pre>
<ol start="13">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  The Pentagon's own videotape does not show a Boeing 757 hitting the building, as even Bill O'Reilly admitted when it was shown on "The Factor"; but at 155 feet, the plane was more than twice as long as the 71-foot Pentagon is high and should have been present and visible; it was not, which means that the building was not hit by a Boeing 757!
</code></pre>
<ol start="14">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  The aerodynamics of flight would have made the official trajectory--flying at high speed barely above ground level--physically impossible; and if it had come it at an angle instead, it would have created a massive crater; but there is no crater and the government has no way out, which means that the building was not hit by a Boeing 757!
</code></pre>
<ol start="15">
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  If Flight 93 had come down as advertised, then there would have been a debris field of about a city block in size, but in fact the debris is distributed over an area of about eight square miles, which would be explainable if the plane had been shot down in the air but not if it had crashed as required by the government's official scenario.

  There are more, especially about the alleged hijackers, including that they were not competent to fly the planes; their names were not on any passenger manifest; they were not subject to any autopsy; several have turned up alive and well; the cell phone calls appear to have been impossible; on and on. The evidence may be found at st911.org.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>Sure it takes that heat to melt steel. But does steel need to MELT to weaken when a however-many-thousand feet building has its full weight on it?</p>

<p>Inconsistencies in the 9/11 Commission report.</p>
<p>[quote=David Ray Griffin] 1. The omission of evidence that at least six of the alleged hijackers — including Waleed al-Shehri, said by the Commission probably to have stabbed a flight attendant on Flight 11 before it crashed into the North Tower of the WTC — are still alive (19-20).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The omission of evidence about Mohamed Atta — such as his reported fondness for alcohol, pork, and lap dances — that is in tension with the Commission’s claim that he had become fanatically religious (20-21).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The obfuscation of the evidence that Hani Hanjour was too poor a pilot to have flown an airliner into the Pentagon (21-22).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that the publicly released flight manifests contain no Arab names (23).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that fire has never, before or after 9/11, caused steel-frame buildings to collapse (25).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that the fires in the Twin Towers were not very big, very hot, or very long-lasting compared with fires in several steel-frame buildings that did not collapse (25-26).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that, given the hypothesis that the collapses were caused by fire, the South Tower, which was struck later than the North Tower and also had smaller fires, should not have collapsed first (26).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>That list is the biggest bunch of bullshit I have ever seen, obviously someone with absolutely no knowledge of engineering or architecture wrote that up.  Not to mention the other points that are just flat out stupid.</p>

<p>I know for sure that that is untrue.</p>

        <blockquote>Oh god, here we go again.
<p>“Furthermore, it takes a temperature of 2,795 degrees to melt construction grade steel, yet the highest temperature jet fuel can reach is 1,517 degrees.”</p>
<p>yawnnn.</p>
<p>Sure it takes that heat to melt steel. But does steel need to MELT to weaken when a however-many-thousand feet building has its full weight on it?</p>
<p>The conspiracy theorists “facts” can be disproven just as easily as the official ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>UL certified the steel in the buildings up to 2,000<em>F for three or four hours before it would even significantly weaken, where these fires burned too low and too briefly at an average temperature of around 500</em>F–about one hour in the South Tower and one and a half in the North–to have even caused the steel to weaken, much less melt.</li>
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  If the steel had melted or weakened, the affected floors would have displayed completely different behavior, with some asymmetrical sagging and tilting, which would have been gradual and slow, not the complete, abrupt, and total demolition that was observed.t
</code></pre>
<blockquote>5. The omission of the fact that fire has never, before or after 9/11, caused steel-frame buildings to collapse (25).
<p>I know for sure that that is untrue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, good. Thanks for posting a source or something?</p>
<blockquote>EDIT: Ah yes, and your average building-fire isn't complicated by the small matter of a passenger plane crashing into it.</blockquote>
<p>Well, the building-fire in WTC7 <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/videos/index.html#building7" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">wasn’t</a>, but it collapsed anyway. Clearly a controlled demolition.</p>
<blockquote>Not only that, but let us also compare your average steel-frame building to the second tallest one in the world.  Roll Eyes</blockquote>
<blockquote>      Heavy steel construction buildings like the Twin Towers, built with more than 100,000 tons of steel, are not even capable of "pancake collapse", which normally only occurs with concrete structures of "lift slab" construction and could not occur in "redundant" welded-steel buildings, such as the towers, unless every supporting column were removed at the same time, as Charles Pegelow has pointed out to me.</blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to believe our government had a hand in the worst terrorist attack on US soil, yet it’s alot harder to believe the official government story of what happened on 9/11.</p>
<p>And don’t forget there is a <a href="http://911review.org/Wget/emperors-clothes.com/images/north-i.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">history</a> of self-inflicted terrorist attacks in the US.</p>

        <blockquote>I'm still looking for proof of this, real proof, not some bullshit like Loose Change.

<p>There’s plenty of proof that the government is lying. For example, if you watch the video I posted of WTC7, it is clearly being demolished. There are only a few fires burning in it, and it suddenly goes whoomf. The lease owner accidentally <a href="http://www.wtc7.net/pullit.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">admitted</a> the building was “Pulled”, which is at odds with the government version.</p>
<p>Also, the 9/11 commision is full of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6837001821567284154&amp;q=9%2F11+commision" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">lies</a>.</p>
<blockquote>Hardly any body died in that stupid terrorist thing. Like a few thousand was it? WOW!!! So many people compared to the 6.5 billion people alive today.</blockquote>
<p>2,752 people died, and what about all the US soldiers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan because of foreign policy change due to 9/11?</p>
<blockquote>Not only do I not believe in it, I also am strongly against the argument that the government held the attack.</blockquote>
<p>Way to present evidence supporting your position?</p>
