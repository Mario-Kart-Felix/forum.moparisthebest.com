              <p>No one decent at coding is going to help you out, I’m sorry but I’m telling you the truth. Any one can do what you’re going to do. If any one is good at Java coding and has a half of a brain, they can run a amazing server by them selves and take all the credit/donations so why would any one want to split that with someone who is practically not doing anything worthy for the server. Learn how to code yourself, and take off your bib.</p>
