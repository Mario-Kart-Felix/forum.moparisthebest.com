    <title>Burn more than 1 movie on a dvd</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/burn-more-than-1-movie-on-a-dvd/75659</link>
    <description>Hello,

I would like to know how to burn more than one movie on a dvd. The dvd I am currently using is only 4.7gb, since it is not dual layer. Anyway, how would I burn more than 1 movie on a single dvd when using nero 7. I just put Casino Royal, in which I removed all of the features and only had the video play, on a dvd. It used up most of the space of the dvd, and it wasn&#39;t even the full movie. The shrinked size of the movie was 802mb, but on nero, when I added it, it showed that it was (around) 4.37gb.

I have a lot of dvds at home, but want to shrink them, and put 2 or 3 on a single dvd.

Please help.</description>

<p>There way to big. And to my knowledge VOB is the only format you can burn to DVDs amd VOB files are huge. You will need to get dual layer i think. Try google for compressing DVDs. DVD shrink may help you.</p>
