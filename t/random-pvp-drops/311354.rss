    <title>Random pvp drops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/random-pvp-drops/311354</link>
    <description>currently im using a prodigyscape base and whenever somone dies outside a safe area the drop is random even if the player has no items 

with them. players on my server are beginning to abuse this by having somone collect the stuff after they die, how would i go about 

removing it or changing it to only wilderness areas or if anyone has any recommendations on ways to make a random drop work better.

any help would be much appreciated.</description>
