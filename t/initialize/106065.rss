    <description>I think some of you heard of that void, just incase a brief run. when you log in, it sends those messags, also &quot;checks&quot; stuff. Anyways

i added a code in there that if someone logged onto the server with that name, alot of things would happen to him, but it goes to fast for the person to see anything!

so i was wondering if there was something i can use to make it go slower?</description>
