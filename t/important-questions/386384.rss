    <title>Important Questions:</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/important-questions/386384</link>
    <description>Why are things to show signs in a certain area (eg: Wilderness Level/Skulll) put in the process method? Why not put in in the walking packet? (I did it for area music, and it worked fine)

After an exception is caught, shouldn&#39;t you be using &quot;printStackTrace()&quot;? (My source doesn&#39;t), if so, should I invoke that wherever an exception is caught?

Why did people develop off winterLove if they knew it was only made to prove it could be done? Also, where is winterLove now? :|</description>

</aside>
<p>This somewhat makes sense, although the process method doesn’t declare where your standing in; the process method wasn’t meant to have all that extra shit jammed into it. If I put it in the walking packet, every time I walk it would make a check if I was in a certain area or not; which means it would work perfectly as long as I wasn’t teleported directly into the area. Although I could always make a check whenever the player is teleported.</p>
