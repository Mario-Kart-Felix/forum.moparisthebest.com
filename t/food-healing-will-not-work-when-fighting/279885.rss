    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/food-healing-will-not-work-when-fighting/279885</link>
    <description>my food seems to not want to work anymore: i would be fighting a monster lets say jad. i would be hitting him with my whip and say he hit a 30 on me, id have 10hp left and if i clicked on  my shark or so it wouldnt heal. ive noticed if id be fighting and my guy would not attack my guy would eat perfectly so any help?

heres my healing method?
[code]/*HEALING*/

public int healTimer = 0;

	public boolean healing() {
		if (healTimer == 0 &amp;&amp; healing[0] == 1 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] &gt;= 0) {
			OriginalShield = playerEquipment[playerShield];
			OriginalWeapon = playerEquipment[playerWeapon];
			playerEquipment[playerShield] = -1;
			playerEquipment[playerWeapon] = -1;
			//setAnimation(0x33D);
                        setAnimation(829);
			healing[0] = 2;
                        healTimer = 0;
		}
		if (healTimer == 0 &amp;&amp; healing[0] == 2) {
			deleteItem(healing[4], GetItemSlot(healing[4]), 1);
			int Heal = healing[1];
			int HealDiff = (healing[2] - healing[1]);
			if (HealDiff &gt; 0) {
				Heal += misc.random(HealDiff);
			}
			if (healing[3] != -1) {
				addItem(healing[3], 1);
			}
			NewHP = (playerLevel[playerHitpoints] + Heal);
			if (NewHP &gt; getLevelForXP(playerXP[playerHitpoints])) {
				NewHP = getLevelForXP(playerXP[playerHitpoints]);
			}
			sendMessage(&quot;You eat the &quot;+GetItemName(healing[4])+&quot;.&quot;);
			playerEquipment[playerWeapon] = OriginalWeapon;
			playerEquipment[playerShield] = OriginalShield;
			OriginalWeapon = -1;
			OriginalShield = -1;
		healTimer = 4;
            resetAnimation();
            updateRequired = true;
            resetHE();
        }
        return true;
    }[/code]
