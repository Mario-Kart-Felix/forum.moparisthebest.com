    <description>Alright so i changed what interface that pops up for the command ::rules, it used to pop up the scroll interface and i changed it to a book. Now when it pulls up the book none of the info that was on the scroll is in the book and the &#39;close window&#39; button does not work, also i cannot turn the books pages, is there anyway to fix any of these problems, any help is appreciated.
thanks,
