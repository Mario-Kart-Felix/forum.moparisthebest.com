    <description>I&#39;m trying to make lava boots for my client
The problem is I can&#39;t find the original colors to it..
I am trying to make them look like the splitbark boots but with orange and yellowish colors.

If anyone could possibly help, please post.

and this is the correct section so none of you morons tell me to go to client hacking section because dog eats dog has already gotten in trouble for posting help there.</description>
