    <description>Can I get an Admin to look into this?
I messed up registration because I was told to make a new account, but I messed up the email. So now I cant use that name and its my Registered Minecraft Account. I need the account that I messed up on deleted or the name removed from it to be able to play I can give you proof that It is my account that I screwed up on.

The forum user I messed up on is,

Elevations

Please remove the minecraft user: Elevationz from it, because of a screw up, I meant to link it with this account, again I screwed up.

If you need any proof of passwords ect, I can give that to you.</description>
