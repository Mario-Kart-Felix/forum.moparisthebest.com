    <description>This could mean the server is down, but I&#39;m not sure.

When I try to log into MoparScape as my Tester account, I always get this message:

[code][09:21:06] Logging into (Tester, *****)
[09:21:06] Your UID is: 78690024
Server: ClientHandler: Accepted from localhost:2696
Registering user tester with pass testpass
Server: hybridscape Server (2): Exception!
Server: ClientHandler: Client tester disconnected.
[09:21:08] 
[09:21:08] Logging into (Tester, *****)
[09:21:08] Your UID is: 78690024
Server: ClientHandler: Accepted from localhost:2697
Did not save for tester
Server: ClientHandler: Client tester disconnected.[/code]

Sometimes when I click Start Server, it says something about 43594 being in use.

One question, when I get a message saying &quot;Cannot log onto server. Must be down.&quot; is that a problem at my end or with something else? Even when I&#39;m not running a server, just playing by myself.</description>
