    <title>Shrooms</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shrooms/264017</link>
    <description>Within the past few months, I have been experimenting with some other drugs other than weed. I have had a couple of amazing experiences with MDMA, and find it to be a really fun, interesting, but quite intense drug. I have the opportunity to get hold of some magic mushrooms, and would really like to try them, however i really don&#39;t have any idea what to expect/doses/do&#39;s/don&#39;ts etc, and would like to hear some experiences from some people. Is it better to drink on them, or should it be used alone with some bud? Any advice on how to make a bad trip less likely, and really anything to do with shrooms :P

Any info will be appreciated</description>

<p>ill be with 3-4 very good friends, and should definitely be in a house. problem is, im normally have a bit of anxiety when coming up on something, but ill try and do it as optimistic as i possible can be. should be plenty of weed between us.</p>

<p>Nope, i bought them from the corner shop yesterday. In the UK it’s only illegal to pick them and prepare them. But buying them and taking them is perfectly legal.</p>

<p>ill be with 3-4 very good friends, and should definitely be in a house. problem is, im normally have a bit of anxiety when coming up on something, but ill try and do it as optimistic as i possible can be. should be plenty of weed between us.</p>

              <p>I’m not an expert by any means, my first time doing them was probably only a year or two ago.</p>
<p>What I tell you is only what works well for me. It’s a strong psychedelic, and can be very unpredictable.</p>
<p>The dose you do depends on the strain and the quality of them. Assuming you will be getting cubensis mushrooms(they are the most common), I would do 3 grams if you’d like to hallucinate. If your dealer isn’t a jew, and he tells you that these are very potent shrooms, dose with caution. You can take a low dose and take more in about an hour if you would like. But if you wait too long, taking more isn’t going to do very much and will be a waste. Plus the comeup itself isn’t always the best because of the anxiety and whatnot, you probably don’t want to extend the come up even longer. If you just want 1.5-2 grams, you probably won’t get anything for visuals but you will see when you get high that visuals aren’t that important, it’s really just a mind trip and you can still have a great time. But like I said it all depends on the mushrooms. Ask the people you’re getting them from about how good they are, so you will have an idea. It would suck to take 3 grams, and it ends up being a very potent strain of mushrooms. Until you’re more experienced anyways.</p>
<p>You can expect some nausea, possibly even vomiting. This is unlikely on low doses. It’s caused because the mushrooms cannot be digested by your body properly. It’s not poison. If possible (they taste pretty bad), chew them in your mouth for a good 15 minutes. They will turn into a very disgusting slimy texture. But it helps a lot with nausea IMO. I’m a wimp for nausea though, you just can’t have fun or enjoy it if you don’t feel good. Most of my friends don’t even experience nausea. Usually if you do, it’ll be during the comeup and you might experience nausea during the comedown too. I prescribe: Marijuana.</p>
<p>These are not a feel-good drug like mdma. You might just feel better, with more euphoria, but this isn’t always the case. You might just feel worse then you have ever felt in your life. Bad trips suck, they are something non-drug users will never be able to relate to, or experience. It’s just completely terrible, I’d rather be puking my guts out sicker then I have ever been, then to have another bad trip. It’s really about set and setting. Ideally, doing them with just 1 friend and no one else around at all, is probably the best. If there are people around you that are not on mushrooms, it’s not very nice and that’s hard to explain why.<br>
In a nutshell, do them with a friend in your house or his house. Be excited to try them, not afraid about what could happen. During a bad trip you will probably think “I am never doing this again, why would ANYONE ever want to do this to themselves.” During a good trip, you will think “Wow this is absolutely amazing, what a great high it’s so nice I feel so good…” etc</p>
<p>The hallucinations you can expect are pretty simple. Objects might look like they are growing and shrinking, and repeating. In a breathing pattern. Everything might look like it’s moving slightly. You might see colorful patterns on the walls, especially in the dark. If your friend waves his arms around, they will leave tracers behind. Like a motion blurred trail, sometimes it’s like a jet stream of color.</p>
<p>The best ever is outside in the summer. Don’t go out when its shitty out though. A flock of birds fly by, they each leave long colorful trails behind them. You will appreciate nature. Inspect the wings of an insect. Look at the patterns on the wings. It’s like mother nature is the one on mushrooms… I have a nice backyard, so having access to my house and the outside is great.</p>
<p>On higher doses, draw stuff. Watch your drawings move and take new forms. Then look at them the next day <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>[quote=“the bank, post:4, topic:264017”]Don’t go outside!  Stay inside!</p>
<p>WITH FRIENDS![/quote]</p>
<p>I agree if the weather is shitty, or it’s winter time. A sunny afternoon in the summer is just amazing though, like I described above.</p>
<p>Sorry for my post being so unstructured. There’s so much to say about them, all my thoughts just come out at once kind of <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Do you have any specific questions?</p>
<p>edit: Oh and weed. I hate mushrooms without weed, honestly. Smoke about half the amount you’d normally smoke during the comeup. Then save some for the comedown. Even having some for the next day is nice since you will feel quite drained.</p>
<p>And sleeping is diffacult, again weed helps.</p>

              <p>Within the past few months, I have been experimenting with some other drugs other than weed. I have had a couple of amazing experiences with MDMA, and find it to be a really fun, interesting, but quite intense drug. I have the opportunity to get hold of some magic mushrooms, and would really like to try them, however i really don’t have any idea what to expect/doses/do’s/don’ts etc, and would like to hear some experiences from some people. Is it better to drink on them, or should it be used alone with some bud?
