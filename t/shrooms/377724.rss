    <title>Shrooms</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shrooms/377724</link>
    <description>My birthday was very recently and I met up with my cousin yesterday whom has the same birthday as me. We talked about drugs and such, and psychadelic mushrooms came up in conversation. Apparently he&#39;s been growing them for about 10 years, and he gave me half a ziplock bag full of them. I want to try them but I have no idea how many I should eat. Also, would it be a bad idea to take one before bed and have mad weird dreams?</description>

              <p>They sell for 30$ an eighth in the states. I’v personally done shrooms 5 times and enjoyed every single trip. Take 3-4 nice sized ones on your first go, have plenty of free time ahead of you as the next 6 hours are going to be pretty interesting.</p>

              <p>I’ve always wussed out of the opportunity to take shrooms. Also worried about having a bad trip and all that. AFAIK shrooms don’t sell for very much over here (UK).</p>
<p>I say you go for it with a group of close mates, could be a really good experience.</p>
