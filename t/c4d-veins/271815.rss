<p>They need more shape. They’re too flat to be interesting.</p>
<p>It also feels poorly composited. Not the composition itself, but as if the cells and the vein are from two different sources.</p>
<p>There’s a few reasons why, and one of them is the third thing I have do say.</p>
<p>DOF. According to that, the two biggest ones are near the middle of the depth, and the two small ones near the bottom are very close in depth.<br>
Shadows. Not really needed in this scene, and what I think is a shadow completely throws off the perception of the scene. I can’t tell where it’s coming from and makes it feel composited.<br>
Size. Do you know how the brain computes a 2D image? Here’s some basics.</p>
<p>Geometrical perspective. Things move towards a vanishing point.<br>
Diminishing size. The scale of things gets smaller as they get farther back.<br>
Location. Things closer to the bottom appear closer to us.</p>
<p>I’m assuming they’re all different sizes, otherwise something is SRSLY fucked up. You really shouldn’t do that, because it really doesn’t do any good in this piece. The two smaller ones would be OK farther back. But you put them up close and that fucks with the brain because of their a) location [near the bottom] and b) size [smaller=farther].</p>
<p>The only way to tell they are up close is because of the DOF. All these things fight against each other and it doesn’t please the eye composition-wise.</p>
<p>Other than that I like the materials (with the exception of the colors being so different between each other, another reason why it feels composited), and would like to know how you did the vein itself.</p>
<p>And chillax on the sharpen filter. DOF exaggerates the existing sharpness, so it’s not needed.[/quote]<br>
The wall feels like mud to me tbh, but if i could make it foggy-like inside of the vein it would feel like liquid, and some distortion etc.</p>
<p>The shadows are from the light at the back of the vein, which i made instead of copying my other light, and forgot to dim the shadows, they’re still at 100%.</p>
<p>They’re different sizes lol.</p>
<p>Its was supposed to look like a frozen vein kinda.</p>
<p>And to continue on the size etc, blood cells are different sizes but not as differently sized as i made them =S, also the inside of the vein is filled with a very dim whiteish color when in a view like this, and that would make it feel more alive and organic.</p>
<p>But i see what you mean, ill probably pop out another before i pass out.</p>
