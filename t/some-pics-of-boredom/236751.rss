    <title>Some pics of boredom</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-pics-of-boredom/236751</link>
    <description>Yeah well I lost my portfolio of pics that aren&#39;t crap, but here&#39;s a few I took this summer randomly.

This is all I have on my computer, I had about 50-70 great black n white shots which I lost. Anyways these are not very creative, and basically I&#39;m a shitty amateur. But they were taken out of boredom, and I&#39;m bored now.. so:

I must have some more on my computer somewhere, I&#39;ll look later. Orrrrr maybe i can find my portfolio someday but I haven&#39;t been able to find it anywhere in my house so I haven&#39;t got a clue. I&#39;ll post more later though..</description>

<p>Well it’s an oldy (1983) but a couple thousand dollars back in the day with the equipment and stuff. And you are right, not much skill is needed for any of these pics. The first one is just some random dead plant that I took with a large aperature opening. The third is just a picture of a flower with my macro lens… etc. And looking back on the butterflies, I can’t even remember how the orange was staying up :S But it was taken at the zoo lol.</p>
