Dreams are simply something your mind does to keep its self productive. It’s basically dumping all your thoughts memory’s ect in one place and combining them all, I though never rember my dreams because I am such a hard sleeper<br>
[/quote]<br>
I remember my dreams like a hour after i wake up. its very nice though about how it dumps everything.[/quote]</p>
<p>So we take a dump in our mind?</p>

I think it could have to do with your life.If you have problems and are not in peace with yourself, it’ll be less likely for you to have lucid dreams<br>
When i was young and had nothing to worry about , i had like 3 consecutive lucid dreams.<br>
I wasn’t aware that i could change my dream, but i could control my actions. Like when i was in a nightmare i just tried to pinch myself in my dream to wake up and it worked every time.</p>
<p>Javacisnotrecognized , could you explain No.2 in your quote?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not exactly sure, but I think it means that you can do much more powerful things in a lucid dream than flying over buildings and shit. I read once that there was a doctor who practiced his operations in lucid dreams at night, and he was known for his precision.[/quote]</p>
<p>It means that you shouldn’t try and forcibly change your dream by thinking about something else. I have done this before when I became lucid and jumped into the air, flying all around. This may be fun for a few seconds but it interrupts the flow of the dream and makes it meaningless as you will most likely wake up shortly after or drift into a non-lucid dream, losing your awareness. If you can gain awareness of yourself without disturbing the flow of the dream, your dream will make much more sense and be more visually clear and easier to remain aware in. The hard part of lucid dreaming is to remain aware, as gaining the first split second of awareness is easily accomplished by most, but prolonged awareness is only attained by those with true control over their minds.</p>
<p>It’s like a game or a sport that requires more focus than you could imagine, but the rewards are high. Once full lucid dreaming is attained, one will have complete control over his or her will power - arguably one of the greatest and most challenging accomplishments a man can make in a single lifetime.</p>
<p>Gain control of your will and anything is possible…</p>

              <p>It’s weird… I seem to be able to remeber my dreams about every other night, but sometimes i may be able to control parts but others i have no control over. If i think in a dream it goes to pot, but if i let it run until i want to control it it can feel like it’s going on for most of the night. Recently i’ve been putting my head on the pillow and BAM! i’m asleep, but about a second later i’m awake and it’s time to get ready for whatever.<br>
Controling my dreams is hard, they have so much detail, everything seems so realistic! If i think back I was once at the beach. dunno why i was, i couldn’t control it but i suddenly walked into the water and collapsed, drowned then moved on to the next dream, but when i walked into the water, i felt water on my legs. When I was falling over i felt like i really was.</p>

              <p>A message I received from someone knowledgable in these things: </p><blockquote>Lucid dreaming is a huge subject, and one where much rubbish proliferates. I will just say the following:
<p>i. not all dreams are the same. Some are very important, some not important at all. The first step is to learn to differentiate between them.</p>
<p>ii. Most people seem to think that the goal in lucid dreaming is to somehow “control” what happens in the dream. If you succed in doing this, you will have transformed a dream into fantasy, and will have robbed it of any value.</p>
<p>iii. Reflect on the relationship between dream and memory. Also reflect on the relationship between the so called “real life” and memory. We have a faint memory of our dreams when we are awake, but do we have even the most faint memory of real life while we are dreaming? The establishment of a “dream memory” (that is a memory of real life while we are dreaming) is crucial to this process, without it no success. This means sleeping with a notebook and pencil nearby and writing your dreams the moment you wake up. This process may take many months before you achieve anything concrete.</p>
<p>iv. “dreaming” is not something that we do while we are asleep. Dreaming is a continuous process, that is happening constantly. It is just that when we are awake there are other things fighting for our attention.</p>
<p>This should get you going.</p>

I haven’t dreamed in a long time, is it because you dream of something, then forget it when you wake up? I never remembered what the reason was =/.<br>
[/quote]You always dream, you just don’t always remember.[/quote]</p>
<p>Start keeping a dream journal, it sounds stupid but doing so allows you to have lucid dreams.</p>

              <p>I’ve been having weird dreams in the past while, I think possibly because of drugs.</p>
<p>Every night I go to sleep I bolt up out of bed in the middle of the night because it feels like I was just having a full blast salvia trip or something similar. I remember watching elephants on parade when I was little and getting nightmares similar to what I am getting now. Where I’m not even a character in my dream and I have no self-awareness, just getting random vivid imagery and confusion.</p>

              <p>Dreams are your brain’s way of storing important memories and solving problems. Thomas Edison was well known for lucid dreaming and thought up many of his inventions, such as the light bulb, 100% thanks to lucid dreaming. This is possible because one has access to his or her subconscious while lucid dreaming and can think and see things that one would not think possible. The dream world really is still mostly a mystery to humans both conceptually and scientifically, but we may uncover more answers and techniques concerning dreaming as our understanding of the brain increases.</p>
