    <description>Yeah, I know we&#39;ve had our fair share of dream threads, but I figured this would be a more logical discussion rather than simply sharing experiences. Anyways..

When you&#39;re dreaming, you are experiencing memories and fantasies, but is it possible that these are all different places in one connected world in your subconscious? For example, you can be dreaming of one specific place one night, and another night you can be somewhere nearby, but still go to that place in the dream. For example, if I was at a local eatery close to a school I&#39;m dreaming of one night, and another night I&#39;m in the school again, I&#39;ve looked down the road and seem the same eatery. Do you think this is just coincidence, or do you believe that your subconscious can create places you can experience multiple times?

Another question that I&#39;m sure is controversial: Do you think it is possible to share dreams with one another, interacting with other people and both remembering the experiences? 

Discuss, and possibly share experiences you&#39;ve had or heard of.</description>

I was so scared when I had my first lucid naturally. I was 8 years old, I just got back from florida (valentines day visiting grandparents). Got back at 11pm, now I recently read that they are more frequent when you are really tired and you get into your most ‘comfortable’ sleeping position. I jumped in bed and turned on the television. Then I felt vibrations (sleep paralysis). I knew I was dreaming because I was having a nightmare and that ghosts were in my room but I felt as If my eyes were open. I tried moving but the vibrations where faster and felt weirder. I got even more scared. I tried speaking. Couldn’t. I moved my toes amd fingers and then I felt as if I woke up. I ran into my parents room and screamed "THERE WAS A GHOST (cries) help there was just ghosts inny room amd they grabbed my head (thinking thats what caused the vibrations). My parents looked at me and told me to not worry about it and shut up… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I was also sweating pretty bad</p>
<p>Well that’s my story for anyone that wanted to know or understand what it is.</p>
<p>I also had an outer body experience at 10. I fell asleep and felt as if my body was floating. It felt like real life or I was the controller of the dream. As if I were my subconscious mind, I traveled through my house and the neighborhood thinking it was a dream. Then I got scared and woke up. (I read that getting overly excited in emotions could trigger it to stop).</p>
<p>Another thing with dreams is I was having a nightmare at like 11, I had a dream that these creepy ass people from children of the corn were attacking my neighborhood. Now this is the part I wanted to talk about. I tried to run as fast as I can and I was in slow motion while everyone else was in regular speed. So I got caught and they captures me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> lol. Stupid dreams.</p>
<p>Other things that I hate about dreams is being in one setting then automatically appear in a different place but still having the same story line.[/quote]You made a little problem in sleep paralysis, but that’s all right because you didn’t know what it was. When it happens, you should accept the fact that it’s a part of your sleep cycle, considering you go through it every 24 hours, and move your toes/fingers/facial muscles. If you want, you can turn your lucid dreams into amazing adventures. Most people who experience vivid lucid dreams for the first time claim it was the best experience that ever happened to them. Next time, do a reality check and look at the finer details of everything (especially your hands) that you wouldn’t naturally see in a dream. Get into the feel of being lucid and a new life will just begin.</p>
<p>If you get scared in a dream when you know for sure that you’re dreaming, just remind yourself that this is all taking place in your own mind. Your own organ you developed over the years, how can it scare you? Also, dreams only transition with same storylines because you think they were the same storyline, yet they were separate dreams you just don’t remember transitions of. Most of the dreams you remember are during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep while your eyes move rapidly, hence the name. This is the state most lucid dreamers want to lucid dream in because REM dreams are much more vivid and last longer.</p>

Ok I just had another lucid dream. I’m kind of confused on what is going on. I am aware that I am dreaming, (I read that lucid dreams have been known to bring up your worst nightmare and it helps you overcome a fear) So as I fell asleep ( i think i did, [lucid dreaming lol]) the nightmare happened, I tried to move in actual life but I couldn’t. Is that apart of being in a lucid dream.<br>

<p>In sleep paralysis, your body forbids your muscles from moving so that you don’t act as you would in your dreams, and stay still. Only parts such as facial muscles can move and your chest (to allow breathing). A simple way to knock out of sleep paralysis is to accept the effect and slowly move your toes and fingers. Move your facial muscles and flex your bigger muscle groups.</p>
<p>This once happened to me and I got really scared but after a few minutes I was able to move again.[/quote]<br>

<p>Ok I just had another lucid dream. I’m kind of confused on what is going on.

<p>In sleep paralysis, your body forbids your muscles from moving so that you don’t act as you would in your dreams, and stay still. Only parts such as facial muscles can move and your chest (to allow breathing). A simple way to knock out of sleep paralysis is to accept the effect and slowly move your toes and fingers. Move your facial muscles and flex your bigger muscle groups.</p>
<p>This once happened to me and I got really scared but after a few minutes I was able to move again.</p>

Its possible to cause this consciously, which is one of the more effective ways of entering lucid dreams or OBEs</p>

<p>lol, it isnt a real term. I meant, adrenaline from a nightmare or whatever. Dreams feel so real at the time with all kinds of emotions. Some good panic brings out the adrenaline (in the dream at least)</p>
