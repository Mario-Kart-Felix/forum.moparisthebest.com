    <description>Well it has been on my mind for a while, so i decided to post about it.
Dreams are what happens when your subconscious takes over, while you are typically sleeping. Sometimes you will remember them, sometimes you won&#39;t. Usually you will not notice it is even a dream, it can feel real some times. However, if you can free your mind of a dream&#39;s typical boundaries, find proof of the dream being a dream while still in it, the dream becomes lucid. A lucid dream is when you are still in the dream, but you have absolute full awareness of it. At this point, your mind can take over and can set your imagination free. Sometimes you may think a dream was lucid, but many times it may not have been. I personally have never had one to such an extent that I could control each aspect of it. Actually, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever even had a lucid dream. However, I do believe there are ways to cause a dream to become lucid. I do not know every way, but I&#39;ve been trying one today (counting peoples&#39; fingers and reading text on objects and around my house twice) and I&#39;m hoping to have one tonight. :) The method I&#39;m trying would have me realize in my dream that the text on the object or something about the fingers (I lol every time at that thought XD) have changed, allowing me to realize that I am in a dream. Also, thinking or saying out loud several times during the day, &quot;I will remember my dreams&quot;, will actually help you remember your dreams that night. I tried it last night and had remembered most details about my dream (it was a good one too, so yay). I&#39;m honestly going to try to experiment every night if I can change what I will dream based on thoughts I have before sleeping. Well anyways, that&#39;s about all I got to say about this. But before posting, I will add something my friend said today. My friend said today that most dreams are like a movie. You&#39;ve played the part at some point, and now all you can do is watch.
Well I suppose you guys should discuss about this. Dreams interest me very much, and I might study them now that I am learning lucid dream induction methods.</description>

<p>That is completely possible yes. The term lucid dreaming just means you are aware it’s a dream. But dream control comes with practice and is 100% possible.  Head to <a href="http://dreamviews.com" rel="nofollow noopener">dreamviews.com</a> if you want to get serious about it. It takes some committment.</p>
<p>You can read this <a href="http://dreamviews.com/dreamcontrol.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://dreamviews.com/dreamcontrol.php</a> but don’t expect to be an expert on the subject just from reading it. But it should give you some more insight.[/quote]<br>

Lucid dreams aren’t nice, My brother had one i spent all night sitting with him trying reassure him it was all a dream, I also had Work @ 7AM the next day.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s not a lucid dream if you had to reassure him it was a dream. Sounds to me like he had a nightmare.</p>
<p>Lucid dreaming is being fully aware that you are in a dream. For instance you may see flying pigs and realize this is impossible and then you realize you are dreaming. With practice you can control aspects of your dream.</p>
<p>What you should do, is do a reality check everytime you see something abnormal in real life. Even if you think something is odd for the slightest reason or even for a second. Pinch yourself, use a lightswitch, look at the clock, see if you can poke your finger through your palm, whatever. Truly and seriously ask yourself “am I dreaming?” If you can program yourself to get into this habit, you will eventually start doing it in your dreams too.</p>
<p>This is nothing though if you can’t remember your dreams. You might have lucid dreams all the time and not be able to remember them! You should keep a dream journal, and the second you wake up after a dream write down every single detail. The more detail the better. After a while you can remember up to 5 dreams a night.[/quote]<br>
<span class="bbcode-s">There is proof when u <span class="bbcode-b">remeber</span> dreams u wil die faster lol<br>
Becous that maens ur brain is overworking trying to put evrything where its supose to be all the 100 000 eyewenks I learn this on school.<br>

              <p>Typically dreams occur while you are sleeping while you are going through REM (Rapid Eye Movement). When they are lucid are when you realize that are are dreaming, and possibly have the ability to change aspects of the dream. Hallucinations are typically while you are awake, but seeing things that you shouldn’t be, or your vision being somehow distorted.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s not a lucid dream if you had to reassure him it was a dream. Sounds to me like he had a nightmare.</p>
<p>Lucid dreaming is being fully aware that you are in a dream. For instance you may see flying pigs and realize this is impossible and then you realize you are dreaming. With practice you can control aspects of your dream.</p>
<p>What you should do, is do a reality check everytime you see something abnormal in real life. Even if you think something is odd for the slightest reason or even for a second. Pinch yourself, use a lightswitch, look at the clock, see if you can poke your finger through your palm, whatever. Truly and seriously ask yourself “am I dreaming?” If you can program yourself to get into this habit, you will eventually start doing it in your dreams too.</p>
<p>This is nothing though if you can’t remember your dreams. You might have lucid dreams all the time and not be able to remember them! You should keep a dream journal, and the second you wake up after a dream write down every single detail. The more detail the better. After a while you can remember up to 5 dreams a night.</p>
