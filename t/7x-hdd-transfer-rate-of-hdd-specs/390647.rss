    <title>7x hdd transfer rate of hdd specs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/7x-hdd-transfer-rate-of-hdd-specs/390647</link>
    <description>it came to my attention that my hard drive has a transfer rate 7x the rate that this model is suppose to be. im not complaining im just wondering why when i use dacris benchmark that it says my hdd transfer rate is 2240 MB/s . i found out that the model my hdd is only 300 MB/s. the fastest hdd next to mine was the classmate who has a $4000 alienware laptop which had 110 MB/s.

if someone could explain why i am getting this that would help me not be so confused. my computer has intel rapid storage technologies installed(it came install when i bought it from the store) and running but i dont think that would do that much of a performance boost seeing it has something to do with RAID and i only have 1 drive.</description>

<p>hitachi says the model of hard drive is suppose to transfer up to 300 MB/s, while mine is at 2200+ MB/s according to a benchmark i took. other classmates have used the same benchmark software and get 20-110 MB/s. so we are all a little confused. but ya its nice to know my hdd transfers at 2+ Gb/s.</p>
