    <title>How To Walk With WSAD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-walk-with-wsad/288152</link>
    <description>I am curious if someone would not mind to tell me how or direct me to editing my client to allow me to move by press the W,S,A,D keys. 

And if it is possible, is it possible to edit how the chat system works, such as i have to press the &quot;Enter&quot; key to type a message.


I have looked all over this forum, and i have yet to find any information nor tutorials in any section on this idea.

Thank you.  :)  :)  :)</description>

              <p>I don’t believe anyone has done this yet, I could be wrong. But one big issue you will have is that fact that walking is based upon tiles, and would require a ton of work to be done both client side and server side. With that said, another issue you will have is packet sending, if someone were to hold down a key to move, it would be constantly sending packets to the server thus causing major lag issues. Now there are a few ways around this, I know of none because I am not good with that networking stuff, but nothing a quick search shouldn’t be able to find. It can obviously be done, but it will require a quite large amount of work.</p>

Right now probably not cause some of the best coders probably arent looking to do this. But if one does I assure you they will share <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
