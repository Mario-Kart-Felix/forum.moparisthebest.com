    <title>Creating a SIMPLE 2D game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-simple-2d-game/423132</link>
    <description>Iv&#39;e been working on RSPS for awhile now and wanted to learn &quot;Real&quot; Java. Iv&#39;e created a project called Bubble Blaster, it consists of using a contraption to launch colored balls using angles to get 3 colors of a ball to &quot;explode&quot; and give points. Iv&#39;e multi packaged it so everything is not held in 1 single file. Anyway&#39;s here&#39;s where it get&#39;s tricky for me, I need to create a GUI and I have no idea on how to really do it. Iv&#39;e had imsuperman05, Atomic_Int, Rene(Different Site) to help me and none of them were able to. SO in my long trek I came here, If anyone is able to help me please don&#39;t spoonfeed me 100%, just a few things to get me started thanks.</description>

              <p>Slick does not have an UI library though, so you’d be forced to either use one of the premade libraries (all of which i can’t stand due to excessive use of XML) or write your own.</p>
