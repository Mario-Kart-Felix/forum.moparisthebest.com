    <title>Attacking in the wildy (not added) 525</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/attacking-in-the-wildy-not-added-525/358079</link>
    <description>How do I make it so you can Pk in the wilderness on a 525? It was a PVP server and I made it safe zone now.

But now I need to know how I can make it so you can fight eachother (Wildy lvls work!) in the real wildy.
The wildy levels are there &amp; the attack option to; but when u click attack nothing happens.</description>
