    <description>Hello Moparscape,

I&#39;m trying to make a unique command for my server, to turn the wilderness on and to turn it off. I&#39;m not sure how to do it, I&#39;ve made the wilderness areas for when the wilderness is on but I don&#39;t know how to make the actual command turn the wilderness on and off. I want the commands to be like this; I am not expecting to be spoon fed because I have an idea of coding. I just need a starting spot and help on how to make it work and function. You may change the coding as much as you want, make it smaller or something. I am needing this now, after I get this I will be able to make things disabled and enabled with ease.

[code=java]
If (command.startsWith(&quot;wildyoff&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3) {

// Code
sM(&quot;The wilderness has be disabled.&quot;);
}

If (command.startsWith(&quot;wildyon&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3) {

// Code
sM(&quot;The wilderness has been enabled.&quot;);
}
[/code]

[i]Note: After I get it working and get help from all of you I will make a tutorial and release it with credits to who ever helped.[/i]
Thanks,

New Legacy. =)</description>

              <p>What’s the boolean used to tell if the player is in the wild?  Find all the places that uses that boolean and just add another boolean checking if it’s true/false whichever you want.</p>

This isn’t exact code to your server.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(OtherPlayerIsInWild()//checking if the other player is in the wild..
