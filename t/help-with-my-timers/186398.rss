    <title>Help with my Timers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-my-timers/186398</link>
    <description>Ok, so I need help with my Timers. I add PkingDelay = 8; in the CORRECT spot, and it doesn&#39;t work. You can click rapidly and still attack rapidly. Can anyone help me with a timer that actually works?</description>
