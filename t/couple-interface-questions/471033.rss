    <title>Couple interface questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/couple-interface-questions/471033</link>
    <description>Ive just started messing with private servers again and was wondering if someone could explain a few things? The first is it looks like we now have the ability to control interfaces completely in the new sources? I assume this since Ive seen working SoF&#39;s. As far as I can tell its something to do with sending a &quot;config&quot; to the client? Second, Sending texts to interfaces seems to have a second of lag where the original text appears first, I assume this is a client side issues, not sure though, Is there a way to make the transition smooth and cut out the old text completely? 

Thanks,
Hiaburi</description>
