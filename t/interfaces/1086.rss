    <description>Can someone post some interfaces for me. Say I wanna get the interface when someone is promted to get teled. Accept, or decline. whatever. Also, I heard that magics are not on animations, so how would you make it to show the magic being cast? another thing, how do I change my hit rates? I hit 28 MOST with dharok greataxe.</description>

Anyways, that would be great if i would recieve the interface. Im also interested in all the interfaces you have, if you want to give em to me add me on msn <a href="mailto:xxzxx_dude22@hotmail.com">xxzxx_dude22@hotmail.com</a> or email me or something. I am also working on giving each weapon its own animation, with different attack styles. I need at least something to start off with. I have some ‘editing’ skills, lol, but i would really appreciate the help.</p>

              <p>I have the interface you mention infact I have basically every interface in the game, if noone tells you its ID by the time I get home tonight I probably will, but only the ID you will have to get it working on your own… which means you need the codes to use magic on other plus you’d be better off using my “TeleToAdvanced” method I posted a tut on if you plan on developing teleOther. As for magic graphics yes they are completely different they are soemthing whitefang is working on currently, and will be released eventually, Hit rates, there was a tutorial posted about this by whitefang himself I believe just search the forums for it.</p>
