    <description>Ok, ive been gone for fucking ever, i got grounded, wtf ever, just recently got my computer back, and privelages (sp), and whatnot, and this new rs2 shit has me lost, ive messed with popcorns deobber and i was furious as the shittyness tbh, but are there any other deobbers that are FREELY available to the common person? mainly i ask, because i just want to deob the mapview client, tweak some shit, and whatnot, so if someone could PLEASE hook me up with a deobber, or even a deobbed mapview client, id love you forever...

              <p>Eww, I didn’t mean to spurt some kind of ‘hp over head’ flame war. PK clients are fucking old (as Krichevskoy stated) and its just a simple like 10 line max bytecode edit regardless. That was really my first step into rs2 client editing back then, and its a good start for anyone and I would suggest it.</p>
<p>I suggest this thread get locked, I think everything has been resolved here. Congrats on getting ungrounded Teh Freak.</p>

<p>Uhh sorry for jumping in here… yeah i did go to kaitnieks a very long time ago… i dont remember it but then again i barely remember yesterday… but it seems to me like you are having delusions of grandeur. I’m not saying that everyone in this community is what you say “worthy”, but a lot are, and although they might not match up to your standards, they still are pretty good. But then again, from your perspective, I kinda agree, as I’ve never released any of my code (although people keep bugging me too…) but that doesn’t mean you have to treat them like shit. And honestly, from the way you are acting, i feel like im speaking to someone younger than me… like 12 or younger. You really should kinda y’know… mature up a bit. Pplsuqbawlz is probably one of my favorite people on this forum because although he is great, he still is very helpful to people who are new at this kind of stuff, while you seem to dwell on those who were around since kaitnieks being always superior. I’m not saying your bad, but… you kinda push people away from liking you.<br>
Sorry if i got any facts wrong in this, really busy with other stuff too…<br>

Fact Check: I’ve been around since 2001, under different alias’s, psycho for one, versteckten as another, o_psycho in another. If you don’t believe me, try finding a copy of my old “guild fisher script” for scar (written in scar 1.13 or something), in the top you notice, the anti randoms are by a person by the name of “o_psycho” which happends to be me, one of my older names.</p>
<p>To be quite honest, I posted the first tutorial ever on <a href="http://kaitnieks.com" rel="nofollow noopener">kaitnieks.com</a> about “focus events” in the runescape 2 client, but since you weren’t there yet, you wouldnt know. And the only reason I did that was because Avars(sp?) asked me to. If he doesn’t recall, that’s fine he’s got MUCH more important things to tend to, but I know some of you have a stash of cache from it, try browsing through, my facts do check out.</p>
<p>Onto another note, there is a cheating public (here for example, rsr, sythe[although quite pitiful], fagex) and there is also a cheating underground, the same could be said for most games. Portal is a participant of the underground, as is Semaphore, both should be treated with respect. If you still choose not to, that’s your choice.</p>
<p>We as a community, need to stop shunning the next generation, and/or newcomers to the public arena. Especially myself, apologies teh freak, for my words. [hr]<br>
Ty, cooper for the kind words and everyone else.</p>

Actually, while negative uid’s could have had a part in the bans, it was the lack of human like mouse that ultimately killed aryan. They flagged every account a week prior to the ban, which meant all mouse events were sent to the server.</p>
<p>Also Teh Freak, I believe I released the first pk client for rs2 back on rscn, along with a tutorial on making your own. (I’m not trying to suggest you ripped it or anything. )<br>

Actually a client change ultimately killed aryan.  I added in a better mouse system to my aryan derivitive.</p>
<p>I view this thread as… I drove a car a year ago, can i fly your airplane?</p>

<p>Then why didnt someone of your intellect do it then? and why did people have a hard time figuring it out? the questions, and yet no answers. but yea, it was easy as fuck to make, i did it in all of 5 minutes, that includes finding out how to do it, and writing the tut, and taking a piss, all in 5 minutes, as was the pk minimap, just blatantly stating, at least ive done something, unlike the other 90% of this “community”</p>

<p>  You say you released hp over head and pk minimap here, as a matter of fact I remember you posting those tutorials but what is even greater is that they were posted after Kaitnieks forums were removed</p>

<p>I’m not involved in this, i don’t agree with some things tehfreak is saying, PSB in old times was put down for never releasing things. Now however psb is releasing extremely good stuff that no one else is =p.</p>
<p>Portal. Tehfreak posted those tuts on kaitnieks BEFORE it died, aand i followed one of them and learnt a good few things.</p>
<p>So although the tut is gone, in remembrance and messing around in the client, i re-created it and the tutorial. (A good long time ago)<br>

<p>I understand where your coming from frank generally when people ask about deobbers they want to start back with editing the client. Didnt want to sound so rude but apparently I did freak but anyways … I was around far prior to aryan. I even remember when semaphore wrote a post on kaitnieks saying watch out guys a week to 2 weeks in advance, that they were monitoring and had something up their sleeves but everyone told him he was a liar because nobody knew him. Within two weeks there was a mass ban and just about every aryan user was busted (plz lets not argue this). Its unimportant what we just started an argumentative war over I just wanted to state my opinion. I say im sorry if I offended you and peace. Good luck with whatever your new goal is with rs cheating.</p>

<p>No…Deobs arn’t just for creating bots (with deobs). They are useful for finding out how the client works. It does not mean one is going to ‘start back with client editing’</p>

<p>semaphore said they were watching every mouse packet.  He also said they were processing every packet.</p>
<p>he is part of the jagex fud machine.</p>
<p>It turns out the aryan devs made everyone have a negative uid, someone told jagex, and jagex then mass banned.  Jagex then credited themselves for the detetion methods instead of the Aryan devs.</p>
<p>Also you guys want ppl to post the best solutions publicly, think again!  The best stuff is all private.</p>
