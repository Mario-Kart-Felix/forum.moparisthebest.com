    <title>[317] Crowns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-crowns/446323</link>
    <description>How do you make it show your crown next to your name when you talk? 

Owners can&#39;t see their own crown when they talk, but other players can see it.

Admins can see their own crown when they talk, and other players can see it too.

Mods can also see their own crown when they talk. Players can see their crown

This isn&#39;t a PI. It&#39;s a wL.

EDIT: fixed.

Before: [code=java] out.write(playerRights);        // mod level[/code]

After: [code=java]if (playerRights == 3)
					out.write(2);
				else
					out.write(playerRights);     // mod level
            out.write(0);                    // no log [/code]
