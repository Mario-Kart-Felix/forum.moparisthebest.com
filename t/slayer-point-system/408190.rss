    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/slayer-point-system/408190</link>
    <description>Ok so.. i followed this tutorial: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=489497.0 when you go into the shop it says you have the right amount of points that you earned (if that makes sense) and when you check the value it says &quot;you need 100 Slayer Points&quot; like its supposed to.. but when you try to buy it, it says you don&#39;t have enough coins... and you can buy the items with coins.. just posting here as a last resort before just getting rid of the whole thing. Thanks a lot to whoever can help :)</description>
