    <description>[s]Well, I got really bored one day, and this is what I came up with.

The first one is for breakout.  I think it should start automatically.

The second is for Tricky Click Ball 2.  That should start automatically.  Just remember to set the window.

The third is for curveball.  You have to manually start this one, but it doesn&#39;t work too well anyway.

I&#39;ll post with more later.

Working on one for Yetisports 2.  I&#39;m getting very little spread, but I gotta tweak it for a bullseye.[/s]

Took them off.  I think RHQ is suspicious.</description>
