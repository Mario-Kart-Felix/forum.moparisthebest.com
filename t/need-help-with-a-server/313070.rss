    <description>Hey every1, after a while i desided to make a rsps, but the problem is i have no experience in this area of expertise, so i need a person who has a lot of experience with 525 clients (because i want this to be a very good client) but if that is not possible then a 317 client for a first is not to bad   so if anyone can help me that would be appreciated, also i would make you a co-owner of my site (im not sure if i can mention it on the forums), so just pos tif you want to help me achieve my goal of starting a rsps   :D

              <p>for 1. wrong section</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>i can help</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>go to server downloads, download a 317 server &amp; client (make sure the server and client come from the same person)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extract both to desktop after downloading, go to the server run, then the client, run, log in with any username and password</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>need Owner? go in your server, find the file character. edit the character file with your username on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>once there look on the left side and find character rights. (or player rights) it will be set to 0, you need to change it to 3 for owner, (but first LOG OUT before making any changes to your server\client</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alright youâ€™ve gotten owner on your server, now alls you need to do is compile it, if compiling does not work, then right click and edit your compiler on your server, change it to the jdk you have (ex. /jdk1.6.0.1/<br>
id have to change to /jdk1.6.0.140.8/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>congradulations, thoughs are the basic start ups on your server. import files your client and server should have are: compile, run, client (or client.java), and CFG files (cfg is configure)</p>
</li>
</ol>
