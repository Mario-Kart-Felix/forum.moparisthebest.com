    <title>Cool Idea...but will probably never happen :/</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cool-idea-but-will-probably-never-happen/27369</link>
    <description>Well after I was thinking away at school today about my YewTerror script, and how to make a perfect human like random mouse movement, I came up with the following idea. Well you know by now (if you can script at all) that we now use mmouse(x,y) and mouse(x,y,) to move/click the mouse. These are human-like and all but I thought really hard. How do you really move the mouse. On the mouse bad right. If you think about it the mouse pad kind of represents the screen, and wherever you move the mouse on the pad the mouse goes on the screen. I thought we maybe could make some sort of mathematical equation that would be used to (instead of using x,y on the screen) use x,y coords according to your mouse pad lenght/width. I know it sounds far fetched and is probably not possible. But, if it did work that would mean [glow=red,2,300]perfect[/glow] mouse moves. Let me give you an example:
    

-----------------]
                        ]
-----------------]                          




^-Mouse Pad, now take that as a graph. According to the 
you move the mouse, the mouse moves to a certain x,y
point on the screen, which is much like using the screen to get 
 x,y points. The only difference is that you would use the dimensions
of the mouse pad to determine the movement of the mouse. Eh,
this will probably have the exact same affect as using the screen
but its fun to ponder on. If anyone at all gets what I&#39;m talking 
about post. Otherwise I understand, its kind of something I can&#39;t put
into words you know  ;D But anyways....ya...


Edit:In simpler terms, you can use the mouse on the mousepad to navigate the whole screen, well by using the position of the mouse you could determine where the mouse on the screen would be, making a perfect curve, or other humanlike movements. To create this heavy math would be required, and you would have to figure out what the relatioship between where the mouse is on the pad and where the mouse on the screen is. M+P=S OR erm...you get the picture :p</description>

              <p>I understand exactly where you’re comming from, and i was also thinking about this myself, but that would mean you’d have to make the points move 1 by 1 to make that perfect arc…</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>a basic graph with points like this…</p>
<p>a x=1 y=1<br>
b x=2 y=2<br>
c x=2 y=3<br>
d x=1 y=4<br>
e x=0 y=5<br>
(this is a basic curve from one point, down to another)</p>
<p>you’re basic goal say, is to go from point a to point e. instead of going directly from point a-e by going  like this…</p>
<p>a x=1 y=1<br>
b x=2 y=2<br>
c x=3 y=3<br>
d x=4 y=4<br>
e x=5 y=5</p>
<p>you would do the first example, like in the point i explained.</p>

              <p>Ya I know, im saying map it out that way…like if it starts in one corner and goes to the top on an angle the mouse would move more human like than just moving to the exact x,y coords right? It would be more of a smooth tranition becuase it would pass each coord 1 at a time. If you click a button to start a new topic does your mouse zoom there or does it gradually and smoothly go to that button? Lol, idk, like I said, It is probably very pointless, but making it have random “cuts” and deviations would be usefull for extra antirandomnesssss</p>

              <p>Let me see what I think this is.</p>
<p>Instead of using x/y for the screen, have thee x/y as the mousemat, not screen, like the lazer picks up the current location from the mousemat and when we move the mouse we move 1, 1 lets say on the mousemat not screen.</p>
<p>That way, we move according to the mousemat, and thus we can say randomly stop/glitch up to be more human-like.</p>
<p>I’ve attached a file, I’ve left all errors due to mouse-mat on(it’s new, and mostly black.), as you can see the arrows point what direction my hand was going to make the lines, this is reflected in the image. Going up across, you can see it going diagonally up right, because my hand was moving right. Same with going down except down right. This indicates I was moving my mouse down while moving my mouse across right. Plain straight lines indicate my hand is always on the mouse and never rests. I doubt this post makes much sense, and if I’m on the original topic as much as I can be, but random mouse moves that reflect some of this data would be useful.</p>
