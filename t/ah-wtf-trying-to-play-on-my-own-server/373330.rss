    <title>Ah WTF?!? Trying to play on my own server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ah-wtf-trying-to-play-on-my-own-server/373330</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a total noob when it comes to hosting a server. I&#39;ve read many guides(5+) on how to make your own server to play on.

Basically I need something to play when I don&#39;t have internet (which is very often). I&#39;ve downloaded various clients and sources and gone step by step through guides and still cannot get anything accomplished. Many of the guides I&#39;ve went through vary in methods and none of them have worked for me.
If you are knowledgeable with this please PM, email, or reply here with a simple but step by step tutorial. I&#39;m trying to learn some coding and just have something to do in my spare time without internet, not actually hosting a server for people to play on.

If you can&#39;t help with that, what is a good source and client to play? I just need something that is a little bit premade that I can mess around on.</description>

              <p>I’m a total noob when it comes to hosting a server. I’ve read many guides(5+) on how to make your own server to play on.</p>
<p>Basically I need something to play when I don’t have internet (which is very often). I’ve downloaded various clients and sources and gone step by step through guides and still cannot get anything accomplished. Many of the guides I’ve went through vary in methods and none of them have worked for me.<br>
If you are knowledgeable with this please PM, email, or reply here with a simple but step by step tutorial. I’m trying to learn some coding and just have something to do in my spare time without internet, not actually hosting a server for people to play on.</p>
<p>If you can’t help with that, what is a good source and client to play? I just need something that is a little bit premade that I can mess around on.</p>
