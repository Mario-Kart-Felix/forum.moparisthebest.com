    <description>Been trying on and off for days to figure this out. It&#39;s hard to explain that&#39;s why i made this video:

Sorry about the link, i can&#39;t post a video for some reason.

case and so on:

<p>[code=java]case 1:<br>
system.out.println(“case 1”);<br>
break;<br>
case 2:<br>

break;</p>
<p>case 3:<br>
case 4:<br>
case 5://so for this, case 3, 4 and 5 will print this because ‘break’ is not in case 3 nor 4. If it was then only case 5 will print this code.<br>
system.out.println(“So now every case has its own function and when it executes that function it ‘breaks’ from the case.”);<br>

<p>If this does not answer your problem, well then you may have learned something about using cases. Idk  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Thank you for that, i am well aware of how cases work.</p>
<p>However. The cases are not the problem as everything works perfectly if the boolean in question is returning false.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Could easily tell that was not your problem <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> you have a return statement after each case, which would have the same effect for this code.<br>
Post that class and i may be able to find the problem<br>
EDIT:<br>
did you by chance set them up in the wrong order? Are you by chance trying to do handleDialog(Client, npc, dialogue) rather than handleDialog(client,dialogue npc) ?<br>
i guess im trying to say, did you write the numbers in your switches backwards? Way looks to me is you have a flaw in your dialogue logic… (Obviously) lol. post that method to pasteBin, may beable to find the issue :P[/quote]</p>
<p>You guys are missing the point, when the boolean is returning false it is fine but when it is returning true it causes this problem. It is triggering something somewhere but i just can’t find it.</p>
