    <title>Need help with my command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-command/155764</link>
    <description>Hello, I made a command called superman for admins... its like fly or &quot;god&quot; cept it has a gfx, everything works, but the only thing is... you know how you lavitate right? with the god and fly command? mine does that, IF i dont wield a 2handed weapon... I want to get it so i can still wield the 2handed weapon and still lavitate..

Heres what my command on the setting emote looks like...

[code]if(isSuperMan == true) {
				{
				playerSE = 1501;
				playerSEA = 1501;
				playerSEW = 1501;
				playerSER = 1501;
				playerSET = 1501;
				playerSET180 = 1501;
				playerSET90wc = 1501;
				playerSET90ccw = 1501;
				stillgfx(246, absY, absX);
			if (item2handed(playerEquipment[playerWeapon]) == true) {
				playerSE = 1501;
				playerSEA = 1501;
				playerSEW = 1501;
				playerSER = 1501;
				playerSET = 1501;
				playerSET180 = 1501;
				playerSET90wc = 1501;
				playerSET90ccw = 1501;
				stillgfx(246, absY, absX);
			}
			}}[/code]

The code has no errors, but it just doesn&#39;t work with 2handers...</description>
