    <description>I Posted this in the wrong section so yeh, [Repost]



So, I know how to make my own animations, but you guys might not.  So, I decided to show you guys [b][i]HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN ANIMATIONS.[/b][/u]

[b]Dufficulty: 2/10

Files used: class23.java, client.java(server)

Files needed: RSMV, Metasequoia[/b]

Step 1:

You need Metasequoia.

First, open metasequoia and make an animation such as, 3 lines parallel to eachother.



Step 2:

Save the metasequoia file as 50000 and make it a .dat file



Step 3:

Put the 50000.dat file in the MODELS folder of your client.



Step 4:

In class23.java in your client add the int


[code]
case 656: // This is the GFX ID change to w/e
originalDataID = 2910; //This is the original ID that was in client.java in the server file
gfx.anInt405 = 2911; //This is the new Id that you will add in the client.java server file
break;
[/code]

Step 5:

Add &quot;656&quot; to your client.java (server) under the weapon you want that to be, such as 4151 (whip)



Step 6:



[code]
if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4151 &amp;&amp; specialAmount &gt; 49){
specialAtkNPC(false, 50, 600, 1658);
stillgfx(341, EnemyY, EnemyX);
}
[/code]

Change that to


[code]
if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4151 &amp;&amp; specialAmount &gt; 49){
specialAtkNPC(false, 50, 600, 1658);
stillgfx(656, EnemyY, EnemyX);
}
[/code]

Step 7:


Where it says &quot;656&quot; that is your gfx, meaning that if you want it can be ice barrage


Step 8:

Add the GFX in a notes pad that way you know what animation it is.



Step 9:

Compile your server, and say &quot;C ya later noob.&quot;



Step 10:

After the server is done compiling, log on and use whip special.



Step 11:


TADA! New whip animation made by you!




[NOTE]-If your too lazy to make your own animations, theres some animations if you run rsmv for a while.
