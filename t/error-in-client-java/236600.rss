    <title>Error In client.java</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-in-client-java/236600</link>
    <description>When compiling i get the error:

[code]Found JDK 1.6.0_02
Results:
client.java:6106: illegal start of expression
             public void debug(String text) {
             ^
1 error
Done![/code]

I am using a devolution server base. i have looked in client.java for where it says the problem is and i cannot find anything wrong, but im new at this, so i might be overlooking something. This is the only appearence of &quot;public void debug&quot; in client.java:

[code]
	public void debug(String text) {
		if (debug)
			sendMessage(text);
	}
[/code]

I don&#39;t think i have edited this at all since i downloaded the server, and it appeared after i edited a command. If i just add a &quot;//&#39;s&quot; before every line in it so the program doesnt do anything with the lines of code, it says the same error with the next &quot;public void ____&quot; I&#39;m not fully sure what this code even does, so if anyone could help me with either of these, i would greatly appreciate it.  :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 14, 2008, 11:32:40 pm[/size][hr]Surely someone must know something about this? please :(</description>

<p>I don’t think i have edited this at all since i downloaded the server, and it appeared after i edited a command. If i just add a “//'s” before every line in it so the program doesnt do anything with the lines of code, it says the same error with the next “public void ____” I’m not fully sure what this code even does, so if anyone could help me with either of these, i would greatly appreciate it.  :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 14, 2008, 11:32:40 pm[/size][hr]Surely someone must know something about this? please <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
