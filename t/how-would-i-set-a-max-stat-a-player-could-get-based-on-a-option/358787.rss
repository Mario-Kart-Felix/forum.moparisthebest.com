    <title>How would I set a max stat a player could get based on a option?</title>

    <description>How would I make three different options be able to set a max stat a player could get? 

example:
pure-can only get up to 20 defense and 90 hp
ranger-can only get up to 90 hp and 60 defense
tank-can only get up to 60 str and 40 attack</description>

              <p>Write a few methods to define your isPure(), isRanger(), isTank(), and within the ‘advanced’ method in your Player class, check the level, and if it’s going to be more than the allowed level, set it to the max level they can get. Don’t forget to set the EXP too.</p>
