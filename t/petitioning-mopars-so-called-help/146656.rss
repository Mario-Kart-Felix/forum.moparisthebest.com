That is the problem. It pisses me off, that I have made FAQ’s to end the stupid questions. If the noob’s would actually look at those, it would be easier. They would learn the answer’s to the problems, easier, and faster. They need to be told how much they can benefit from things people have made to help them understand, and learn. The occasional problem with things while doing this is alright, as it is something that does require additional help, and explanation. Thread’s like those I do not mind at all.<br>

<p>It’s not a tut. Which brings me to ask, have you searched for your problem there?</p>

<p>Then get in more trouble…I’d like to remain unbanned, tyvm.</p>
<p>Also, Taharok, the rules say no flaming. Could you imagine the number of bans you’d have if the mods and admins actually banned <span class="bbcode-i">90%</span> of the flaming here?<br>
It’d be a very high number, and a large proportion of people who actually come here.<br>

<p>Hmm, there would be no community. People are not perfect. All we can do is set rules and warn you to follow them or get a nice shiny visual warning badge. Other than that, it is the community’s overall choice whether they want to bitch around in a shithole all day or actually get work done in a developmental environment.</p>

<p>I guarantee there would be no community at all. The community depends on its members.<br>

<p>Same, it gets tiring helping people over and over again with the same questions.<br>
And most of the time, they don’t understand what your telling them to do anyways.</p>

Providing us with some evidence may help the matter. Sure you may say it happened, but that me not be exactly what happened. Maybe you were being an ass and deserved to get flamed. Maybe you were constantly breaking the rules when posting. This is why evidence is so important. There is always a reason as to why people do things. We need to see the full situation before we can asses the issue. I am sure everyone will agree with me on that.<br>

<p>It is usually the asshole who flames you; not you being an asshole to deserve flaming (because 1) that is a <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> scenario and 2) that means two assholes are involved.)[/quote]</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some Moparisthebestians decide to come here and bring thier scenario’s here. However you have a point. However, for this particular situation, we do not know the story as to what happened to these two. This still brings me back to me other point as maybe they deserved to be flamed, because they might have been assholes themselves.</p>
<p>I understand your point by making this thread. Sometimes flaming happens when there may just be one person following the  rules, and one asshole comes along decides to flame them because they feel like it, or maybe they spelt something wrong (I have seen this before). However, this does not, under any circumstances give you the right to flame them back, or flame us, who have done nothing. Getting pissed off due to the situation you are in, is not a way to solve your problem. Right now, I think the best possible situation is to give the person who flamed you a <span class="bbcode-b">kind and polite</span> PM, and consult them as to why they flamed you. This can also be done over msn. If this goes to far, you can stop PMing and end the situation. If you do not choose to do this, the only other option is to forget about it, and hope it doesn’t happen again.</p>
