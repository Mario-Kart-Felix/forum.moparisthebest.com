              <p>I don’t have SCAR on this computer so I’m not sure if this is the only error, but the declareplayers procedure is messed up.  You can’t say that HowManyPlayers=1 when you have 3 player slots.  If you don’t want to use certain players change Active to False, or when changing howmanyplayers delete that players slot.  Here’s it fixed:</p>
<p>[code]procedure DeclarePlayers;<br>
begin<br>
HowManyPlayers := 3;<br>
NumberOfPlayers(HowManyPlayers);<br>
CurrentPlayer := 0;</p>
<p>Players[0].Name := ‘(put ur user here)’;<br>
Players[0].Pass := ‘(put ur pass here)’;<br>
Players[0].Nick := ‘(the first 3 or 4 letters of your user)’; //3 - 4 letters of YOUR username, example: zima<br>
Players[0].Active := True;<br>
Players[0].Integer1 := 100; //Amount of loads</p>
<p>Players[1].Name := ‘’;<br>
Players[1].Pass := ‘’;<br>
Players[1].Nick := ‘’; //3 - 4 letters of YOUR username, example: zima<br>
Players[1].Active := False;<br>
Players[1].Integer1 := 100; //Amount of loads</p>
<p>Players[2].Name := ‘’;<br>
Players[2].Pass := ‘’;<br>
Players[2].Nick := ‘’; //3 - 4 letters of YOUR username, example: zima<br>
Players[2].Active := False;<br>
Players[2].Integer1 := 100; //Amount of loads<br>
end;[/code]</p>
