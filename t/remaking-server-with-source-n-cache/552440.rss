<p>You change the data in the cache to match the one you’re trying to recreate…<br>
If it had 508 maps, you need 508 maps. It had 602 anims? you have to get em too. And so on.</p>
<p>Then in the server you’d have to move npcs to the locations that server had… spawn ones you don’t already have spawned… Etc.<br>
That’s the same for: dialogues, spawns, minigames, and everything else.</p>
<p>Recreating something is best done if you had played it thoroughly and know the ins and outs…</p>
<p>There is no tutorial on this because this isn’t tutorial worthy.</p>
<p>"How to recreate a server"<br>
Step 1: Download a server<br>
Step 2: Change everything in that server to match the one you want to recreate.<br>
end of tutorial.</p>
