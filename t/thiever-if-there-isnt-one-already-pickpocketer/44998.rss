    <title>Thiever if there is&#39;nt one already(pickpocketer)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thiever-if-there-isnt-one-already-pickpocketer/44998</link>
    <description>it seems to be pretty simple find guard color right click
click pickpocket
eat
log out or go to bank and withdraw cakes if no more food
add anti randoms randoms

if someone could make me one i would be very thank full. it doesn&#39;t even really need anti randoms because ill be there watching it but anti randoms would be good

realistic mouse movements would also be great

if there already is one , if you could point me in the right direction that would be great

thanks in advance

EDIT: if it does bank for cakes it would be from the north ardouge guards to the north ardouge bank</description>
