    <title>JEditorPane and Applets</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jeditorpane-and-applets/5085</link>
    <description>I know for a fact that JEditorPanes cannot work applets, mainly because they do not support the &lt;applet&gt;, &lt;embed&gt; and &lt;object&gt; tag but I know that there must be a way around this. Does anybody know how I could get it to work an &lt;applet&gt; tag? I have searched google and other places too but to no avail.

Thanks =D</description>

I’ll look into it! I never knew sun had their own web browser but I suppose it’s obvious really since that (if I remember correctly) was how java was first created…[br][size=1]Posted at: July 16, 2006, 05:14:31 PM[/size][hr]So, where do you download the source of it?</p>

              <p>I’ve never looked into this personally, but I’d check out Sun’s HotJava browser - made entirely in java and it does apparantly support applets.  After a quickly looking into the source, it seems that you may even bee able to incorporate its sunw.hotjava.applet package into a custom JEditorPane or something to support applets.  Although the main browser panel seems to just be an awt Panel, you could possibly use it in a similar way with the JEditorPane <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
