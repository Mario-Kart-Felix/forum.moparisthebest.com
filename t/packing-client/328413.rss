    <description>How would I pack the entire client to have it ready to import to an installation package. (like 2speced)

I know you have to use jarmaker, but I followed Ric&#39;s tut on how to sign the jar and after no errors I ran my server and then tried running jar file for the client and nothing would never appear. Help please?</description>
