    <description>    For decades cultures around the world have prophesied of the end of time, many of these cultures are well known and are well documented about on the history channel&#39;s &quot;the Nostradamus effect&quot; such as the Mayans with their long-count calendar which mysteriously ends on December 12th 2012 and the Hopi Indians who believe that the fourth world of destruction closes and the fifth world of peace begins on the year 2012. My reasons for writing this document are not to argue if these cultures are correct or not but yet to offer peace of mind to the select few who will decide to accept what I say is true and to hopefully pass on this message.

    After watching all the shows on the history channel about all the worlds cultures endtimes prophecies and doing hours and hours of researching the book of revelations (which states that the new world would have a peace that lasted for 1000 years) and more modern day prophets I have come to accept that one day the world will end I personally think it may on the year 2012 but that is of little to no importance, what is important rather is how you perceive the events occurring beforehand. For three years (since the first day I goggled 2012) I have been scared of the so called coming doom, had nightmare of fire engulfing entire cities, in short I was terrified of the fact I could be dying at the age of 22 ( how old ill be at December, 21 2012 ).after doing many hours of research and history channel watching I came across &quot;webbot&quot; it’s a computer application that combs the Internet for strings of text and uses linguistic tools to read and understand the words around the screen. Webbot successfully predicted many world disasters including the nine eleven attack on the world trade center and hurricane Katrina. after thinking about how webbot could successfully operate by combing hundreds of thousands lines of text for predetermined strings I came to the inevitable conclusion that every human at least, has some form of a physic  conscious. In other words I believe that everyone in the world can see a small bit of prophecy but not enough to see the full. Please do not misunderstand that statement I do believe there are true prophets in the world who are more aware of their separate conscious than others, the earlier sentence simply described what you would define as a normal person&#39;s conscious. With all that in mind I found myself in January 2010 in a state between daydreaming and sleeping wondering to myself what would a world of peace for a thousand years be like? Would I fit in? Would there be anyone there I know? And a simple answer came to me from seemingly nowhere; this I believe was my physic conscious kicked it. What I came to understand finally put me at rest and I am no longer afraid of what is to come, even if it does not come in my life time but what I came to understand was I simply could not fit in a world of peace. Before you think I&#39;m sadistic or cynical understand what I mean when I say this, as a person who was raised in a win or lose world I would not be able to ever adapt to such a world with no conflict, no competition, no sports, no games, no more I&#39;m right and your wrong arguments, I would be miserable is such a place and once I understood that I became proud I would get the chance to live in the endtimes of my world.

    In conclusion after reading all about how all humans have their own little part of the big picture of what is to come I realised why I was terrified to begin with and why I am now completely at ease. We cannot understand the horrible big picture of a apocalyptic event until we understand the small part of the picture that our collective physic conscious foresees. Can you see the beauty of this simple yet elegant conclusion
If you would like to talk to me about my conclusion you can respond to this topic or email me at albmed7589@yahoo.com for a less public response

              <p>ps bollocks thread is bollocks, a world of peace does not mean no sports or any games with win and lose outcome you idiot, you play sports with your friends do you not? its not like you play for blood and the loser gets their finger servered is it? The world ending in 2012 is a bit of bollocks assumption, just because the mayan calendar ended then doesnt mean humanity will, it mightve been their scribe for doing the calendar died when he had reached the year 2012 and idiots like you go into a massive omg my world is going to end hissy fit.</p>
<p>As for prophets, psychic abilities and the like, its more bullshit than there has ever been, dont be moronic and try and bring up some of those old prophets who’s writing has been ‘interpreted’ to predict events that happened after their time because its all bullshit, take nostradamus for example his writings have been reviewed so many times nad people keep coming up with new predictions from his old writings, thats because he was wrong the first time round and now they want to make it seem like he’s right and that they were wrong. Not only that but these old prophets wouldve made thousands of predictions ranging from the ludicrous to the every day, by pure chance at least some of them wouldve had to have been right, the writings that are wrong are just never mentioned or ever brought up.</p>
<p>In short, you went on a trip of ‘self enlightenment’ because you shit yourself at some old text and now you claim to understand the world when in fact you’ve just filled your head with shit. Go back on your self enlightenment trip and come back with something decent next time.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <pre><code>For decades cultures around the world have prophesied of the end of time, many of these cultures are well known and are well documented about on the history channel's "the Nostradamus effect" such as the Mayans with their long-count calendar which mysteriously ends on December 12th 2012 and the Hopi Indians who believe that the fourth world of destruction closes and the fifth world of peace begins on the year 2012. My reasons for writing this document are not to argue if these cultures are correct or not but yet to offer peace of mind to the select few who will decide to accept what I say is true and to hopefully pass on this message.

After watching all the shows on the history channel about all the worlds cultures endtimes prophecies and doing hours and hours of researching the book of revelations (which states that the new world would have a peace that lasted for 1000 years) and more modern day prophets I have come to accept that one day the world will end I personally think it may on the year 2012 but that is of little to no importance, what is important rather is how you perceive the events occurring beforehand. For three years (since the first day I goggled 2012) I have been scared of the so called coming doom, had nightmare of fire engulfing entire cities, in short I was terrified of the fact I could be dying at the age of 22 ( how old ill be at December, 21 2012 ).after doing many hours of research and history channel watching I came across "webbot" it’s a computer application that combs the Internet for strings of text and uses linguistic tools to read and understand the words around the screen. Webbot successfully predicted many world disasters including the nine eleven attack on the world trade center and hurricane Katrina. after thinking about how webbot could successfully operate by combing hundreds of thousands lines of text for predetermined strings I came to the inevitable conclusion that every human at least, has some form of a physic  conscious. In other words I believe that everyone in the world can see a small bit of prophecy but not enough to see the full. Please do not misunderstand that statement I do believe there are true prophets in the world who are more aware of their separate conscious than others, the earlier sentence simply described what you would define as a normal person's conscious. With all that in mind I found myself in January 2010 in a state between daydreaming and sleeping wondering to myself what would a world of peace for a thousand years be like? Would I fit in? Would there be anyone there I know? And a simple answer came to me from seemingly nowhere; this I believe was my physic conscious kicked it. What I came to understand finally put me at rest and I am no longer afraid of what is to come, even if it does not come in my life time but what I came to understand was I simply could not fit in a world of peace. Before you think I'm sadistic or cynical understand what I mean when I say this, as a person who was raised in a win or lose world I would not be able to ever adapt to such a world with no conflict, no competition, no sports, no games, no more I'm right and your wrong arguments, I would be miserable is such a place and once I understood that I became proud I would get the chance to live in the endtimes of my world.

In conclusion after reading all about how all humans have their own little part of the big picture of what is to come I realised why I was terrified to begin with and why I am now completely at ease. We cannot understand the horrible big picture of a apocalyptic event until we understand the small part of the picture that our collective physic conscious foresees. Can you see the beauty of this simple yet elegant conclusion
</code></pre>
<p>If you would like to talk to me about my conclusion you can respond to this topic or email me at <a href="mailto:albmed7589@yahoo.com">albmed7589@yahoo.com</a> for a less public response</p>
<p>p.s: forgive me for bad grammer and spelling mistakes I did my best</p>
