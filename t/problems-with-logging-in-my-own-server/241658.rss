    <title>Problems with logging in my own server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-logging-in-my-own-server/241658</link>
    <description>I am currently having problems with logging into my own server. Every time I click login immediately &quot;Error Connecting to server&quot; Appears. I don&#39;t know what has happened, but I used to be able to login to my server. Please can someone explain how to get past this. If it helps I am using Utorrent to host the server as this is easier than Port-forwarding.</description>

<p>127.0.0.1 is default localhost IP address.<br>
So is 0.0.0.0, so it would log you in. Please learn a little and concentrate on some things around the forum before making stupid remarks like that.</p>

<p>Learn what you’re talking about before you post. Also you need to go back to English class and learn grammar.<br>

You don't know what you're talking about either.  He got an error while running the server on the cmd,so obviously he has his ip set "smart one."
