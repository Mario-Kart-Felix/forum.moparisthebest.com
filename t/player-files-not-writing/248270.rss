    <title>Player files not writing?!?!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-files-not-writing/248270</link>
    <description>On my server whenever a new player comes the player files are not made. They never are made. every other folder gets written in, except characters. Yes it is spelled correctly because the players already made can play. charbackup doesnt work either.</description>
