    <title>[TWG] Advanced Voting System [Website Integrated]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/twg-advanced-voting-system-website-integrated/454787</link>
    <description>I was up fairly late last night just thinking about a good project to do so that my web development skills don&#39;t vanish completely, and as I was doing so someone on my Skype had asked me if I could make voting systems for servers, well I thought, &quot;Yes, I can.&quot; so here I am right now, sharing some of my thoughts, and somewhat brainstorming as i&#39;m writing this, hopefully the Moparscape community will help me with some ideas.

So some of my thoughts to make this vote system different than others, is to have the part where you buy stuff, implemented into the website, and you receive the item in-game, automatically. Seeing as I know Web Development, and not Java, I&#39;m not sure how hard it would be to have the items automatically received in-game. I&#39;ll have to find someone that is more advanced with Java to do that part and hopefully release a tutorial on it. With the voting system, users go to a page on your website, where they can register, and login. I can have the vote system to one of two things, read the user data from the forums accounts, or an individual one for the voting system, however the second choice would mean users would have to create two accounts. I&#39;m still debating those two, and it would be helpful to let me know what you think.

After the user has logged in, they are presented with a notice or a message that can be specified to whatever the server owner would like it to be. On the left side, you have a navigation, and on the right side, you have a user panel, which displays the current vote balance, username, last login, and more information. 
Now, what I mean by &#39;vote balance&#39; is what I think makes this different than most vote systems. Say you have four voting sites for a server, when a user clicks one, and votes on that site, a certain number (can be set by server owner) is added to the account balance. If the user votes on all four sites and each site is worth 0.25 credits, the user will now have 1 credit on their account (4x0.25). Now the user can proceed to go to the shop, and purchase whatever items they would like with their vote points/credits. Say and abbysal whip is 0.75 credits, if you can do simple math, the user will now have 0.25 credits on their account, and the automatic system will give the user an Abbysal Whip in-game. 

For adding shop items I am going to have an easy interface for owners to add items, they simply input a few pieces of data, and it&#39;s up, with users able to buy it immediately after it&#39;s posted. With the option to upload a picture, price, etc. Those few thoughts are the bulk of the idea, however I had a few more misc ideas that I may try out and see how they work, depending on some of the feedback I get.

1. Option to sell back voting items
&gt;&gt; Once again, I&#39;m really not so sure how hard this would be able to do, you&#39;ll have to set up some if statement in php and have it interact with the java side. Say a user wants to sell back an Abbysal Whip, you&#39;d set something up where if the user has item id 4151 then proceed to sell the item at 75% of it&#39;s purchase cost. Personally I think it would be silly to have the sellback cost the same as the purchase cost, however this is another choice that i&#39;ll leave to the owner (sellback price). If the Abyssal whip cost 0.75 credits, it will now be sold back for ~0.56 credits, and these funds will be added to the users balance and can be used for other items. 

2. Give voting credits
&gt;&gt; This would be very simple for me to do, this makes the voting system more interactive with user to user interaction. Players can send another player x.xx amount of credits, in return for an in-game item, or just to be generous.

3. Implement it with common open-source forums
&gt;&gt; Every server pretty much has a forums, that they most likely downloaded open-source from the internet, whether it be vBulletin, SMF, PhpNuke, or something else. This thought is that when you go to another users profile, you can see how many vote credits they have, and what their last few purchases have been, as all of this information is already logged for administrative purposes. The user will be able to select whether or not they want this information to be displayed on their profile, so they aren&#39;t completely stuck with something they don&#39;t want.

Those are some of my thought processes, let me know what you think, I&#39;ll have pictures up tomorrow with some of my progress, please let me know if you have a good suggestions for this. Thanks, and I hope for some good feedback and for the community to share their thoughts! - The Web Guy / AJ

Sidenote: This same system could easily be changed to fit donation needs with auto donation, such as Soulsplit has.

EDIT:

As promised, here is one picture of some of the work so far, I have been working on the admin panel, I created a rights system with different rights to show different pages and text for different users, and gives different groups to do more stuff. This is the user logging center/user edit center. You can double click any text here and edit it and it will automatically save in the database. Search system is already working for users, uses a smartsearch system for more advanced results. Stay tuned for more images coming soon.

EDIT:

More updates, as promised. I&#39;ve got the ban system, demote, promote system, vote system, and much more completed. Recently I made it so that if the user is banned, they cannot view any pages on the site, other than appeal (if wanted).

This picture is the shop area, 10 items to a page, item image, name, requirement, price, and a buy button.
This is mainly CSS/HTML and it&#39;s almost 500 lines of code for just getting the layout, the actual scripts aren&#39;t even done.

          <blockquote>
              <p>I was up fairly late last night just thinking about a good project to do so that my web development skills don’t vanish completely, and as I was doing so someone on my Skype had asked me if I could make voting systems for servers, well I thought, “Yes, I can.” so here I am right now, sharing some of my thoughts, and somewhat brainstorming as i’m writing this, hopefully the Moparscape community will help me with some ideas.</p>
<p>So some of my thoughts to make this vote system different than others, is to have the part where you buy stuff, implemented into the website, and you receive the item in-game, automatically. Seeing as I know Web Development, and not Java, I’m not sure how hard it would be to have the items automatically received in-game. I’ll have to find someone that is more advanced with Java to do that part and hopefully release a tutorial on it. With the voting system, users go to a page on your website, where they can register, and login. I can have the vote system to one of two things, read the user data from the forums accounts, or an individual one for the voting system, however the second choice would mean users would have to create two accounts. I’m still debating those two, and it would be helpful to let me know what you think.</p>
<p>After the user has logged in, they are presented with a notice or a message that can be specified to whatever the server owner would like it to be. On the left side, you have a navigation, and on the right side, you have a user panel, which displays the current vote balance, username, last login, and more information.<br>
Now, what I mean by ‘vote balance’ is what I think makes this different than most vote systems. Say you have four voting sites for a server, when a user clicks one, and votes on that site, a certain number (can be set by server owner) is added to the account balance. If the user votes on all four sites and each site is worth 0.25 credits, the user will now have 1 credit on their account (4x0.25). Now the user can proceed to go to the shop, and purchase whatever items they would like with their vote points/credits. Say and abbysal whip is 0.75 credits, if you can do simple math, the user will now have 0.25 credits on their account, and the automatic system will give the user an Abbysal Whip in-game.</p>
<p>For adding shop items I am going to have an easy interface for owners to add items, they simply input a few pieces of data, and it’s up, with users able to buy it immediately after it’s posted. With the option to upload a picture, price, etc. Those few thoughts are the bulk of the idea, however I had a few more misc ideas that I may try out and see how they work, depending on some of the feedback I get.</p>
<ol>
<li>Option to sell back voting items</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once again, I’m really not so sure how hard this would be able to do, you’ll have to set up some if statement in php and have it interact with the java side. Say a user wants to sell back an Abbysal Whip, you’d set something up where if the user has item id 4151 then proceed to sell the item at 75% of it’s purchase cost. Personally I think it would be silly to have the sellback cost the same as the purchase cost, however this is another choice that i’ll leave to the owner (sellback price). If the Abyssal whip cost 0.75 credits, it will now be sold back for ~0.56 credits, and these funds will be added to the users balance and can be used for other items.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Give voting credits</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This would be very simple for me to do, this makes the voting system more interactive with user to user interaction. Players can send another player x.xx amount of credits, in return for an in-game item, or just to be generous.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Implement it with common open-source forums</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every server pretty much has a forums, that they most likely downloaded open-source from the internet, whether it be vBulletin, SMF, PhpNuke, or something else. This thought is that when you go to another users profile, you can see how many vote credits they have, and what their last few purchases have been, as all of this information is already logged for administrative purposes. The user will be able to select whether or not they want this information to be displayed on their profile, so they aren’t completely stuck with something they don’t want.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Those are some of my thought processes, let me know what you think, I’ll have pictures up tomorrow with some of my progress, please let me know if you have a good suggestions for this. Thanks, and I hope for some good feedback and for the community to share their thoughts! - The Web Guy / AJ</p>
<p>Sidenote: This same system could easily be changed to fit donation needs with auto donation, such as Soulsplit has.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>As promised, here is one picture of some of the work so far, I have been working on the admin panel, I created a rights system with different rights to show different pages and text for different users, and gives different groups to do more stuff. This is the user logging center/user edit center. You can double click any text here and edit it and it will automatically save in the database. Search system is already working for users, uses a smartsearch system for more advanced results. Stay tuned for more images coming soon.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>More updates, as promised. I’ve got the ban system, demote, promote system, vote system, and much more completed. Recently I made it so that if the user is banned, they cannot view any pages on the site, other than appeal (if wanted).</p>
<p>This picture is the shop area, 10 items to a page, item image, name, requirement, price, and a buy button.<br>
This is mainly CSS/HTML and it’s almost 500 lines of code for just getting the layout, the actual scripts aren’t even done.</p>
