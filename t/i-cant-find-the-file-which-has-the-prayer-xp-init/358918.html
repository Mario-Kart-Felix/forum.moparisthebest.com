<p>You obviously don’t know what arrogance is…  I asked a question, and he gave me response, then I provided an easier solution to the same problem.  Then, he claimed I missed some point (which he has failed to back up), so I asked him to back up his idea with a list of pro/cons (I didn’t ask for a paper analyzing the cost/benefits, I asked for a simple pro/con chart…), and after he decides to not back  up his idea, proceeds to ask a question that has already been answered…  So, I proceed to answer the question, even though it has been answered.</p>
<p>There is a difference between being arrogant and being correct…</p>
