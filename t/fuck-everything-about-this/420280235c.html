        <p>I think they can understand very well they just have a few tricks, mothers being wired to respond to them crying etc, so whining and tantrums are often inevitable.Take them away from their parents and the situation changes, teachers control large classes of 30+ 5 year olds using nothing but their voice. Not that I think a shouting contest is any better, but its one up from physical pain.</p>
<p>You’re right kids don’t accept punishment, but neither do adults - no-one willingly goes to jail for a crime, think of all the copyright infringement I’m sure you’ve commited (I know I have) if you got told you were going to jail tomorrow I doubt you’d just roll over and accept it. You’d fight it. Infact even when most adults are confronted with wrong doings by friends, the natural reaction in many cases is to lie. You have to wonder where that instinct comes from… perhaps from childhood and the fact lying avoids pain, but that’s just me speculating.</p>

A teacher controls a room of 5 year olds yes, but often there is more than 1 (there are stupid new laws these days) also as a child there is nothing more intimidating than being told off by a stranger. Also look at it this way when, in years gone by, the teacher could use the cane etc there was a lower rate of disobedient children, now there are more people so naturally there will be more disobedient children but the rate has increased because the teacher can’t use the cane, kids can get away with more and more stuff in schools than they ever used to (you’d be naive to even try and counter that as anyone in schools will tell you that these days its ridiculously lax and the things some kids get away with baffle me.)</p>
<p>Also yes I have commited copyright infringement, who hasn’t? even watching an unorthorized copy of a song on youtube is technically copyright infringement. But what makes that different is that I understand that, I understand what it is I’m doing, and recognize the implications it has when I do it, however I do it knowing that from my point of view I don’t feel as if I’m doing harm (inb4 piracy debate) I feel no remorse for downloading a film to watch that i otherwise would never have bought because it hasn’t taken money from anyones pockets. If I had murdered someone I’d accept that I’d be facing jail for a significant quantity of time, and if you don’t feel that murder and copyright infringement are on the same scale then how about theft? If I stole someone’s car I’d accept that I’d be going to jail or whatever punishment they’d inflict on me because I’ve done wrong. But you see if an Adult won’t accept punishment how could you expect a child to unless you force it on them?</p>

<p>Sure, teachers have lost a great tool when caning was forbidden. But there still are teachers capable of keeping the attention of the children, and there still are parents who raise their children properly without the use of physical punishment. What does that tell you? To me it shows that parenting and teaching requires certain skills, such as perseverance. When a child nags, you shouldn’t give in. Giving in is a reward, and any rewarded behavior will stick.</p>
<p>I have a dog, and I’ve learnt that positive reinforcement will result in good behavior, and still means a good bond with your dog. But it does require patience. I can imagine that when your dog doesn’t respond to a command, you’ll get a bit physical. However, if you are patient enough, and reward the behavior that you want to see, you’ll end up with a properly raised dog. Humans are a bit more complex, but when children are still young their mind works similar to that of a dog.</p>
<p>Children and dogs both want attention. Negative attention is attention too, so ignoring bad behavior is just as important as rewarding good behavior. Again, patience is a must.</p>

<p>Not necessarily. If you ignore a dog climbing up on the counter and eating the thanksgiving turkey, you wouldn’t ignore it. You would smack that dog on the nose so it knows not to do that again. Same applies with a child. If the child is stealing candy from 7/11, you don’t ignore it.</p>

<p>Not necessarily. If you ignore a dog climbing up on the counter and eating the thanksgiving turkey, you wouldn’t ignore it. You would smack that dog on the nose so it knows not to do that again. Same applies with a child. If the child is stealing candy from 7/11, you don’t ignore it.[/quote]Equating children to dogs, no wonder the US has so much crime.</p>

<p>Also look at it this way when, in years gone by, the teacher could use the cane etc there was a lower rate of disobedient children, now there are more people so naturally there will be more disobedient children but the rate has increased because the teacher can’t use the cane, kids can get away with more and more stuff in schools than they ever used to (you’d be naive to even try and counter that as anyone in schools will tell you that these days its ridiculously lax and the things some kids get away with baffle me.)</p>

<p>Also yes I have commited copyright infringement, who hasn’t? even watching an unorthorized copy of a song on youtube is technically copyright infringement. But what makes that different is that I understand that, I understand what it is I’m doing, and recognize the implications it has when I do it, however I do it knowing that from my point of view I don’t feel as if I’m doing harm (inb4 piracy debate) I feel no remorse for downloading a film to watch that i otherwise would never have bought because it hasn’t taken money from anyones pockets. If I had murdered someone I’d accept that I’d be facing jail for a significant quantity of time, and if you don’t feel that murder and copyright infringement are on the same scale then how about theft? If I stole someone’s car I’d accept that I’d be going to jail or whatever punishment they’d inflict on me because I’ve done wrong. But you see if an Adult won’t accept punishment how could you expect a child to unless you force it on them?</p>

<p>Exactly, and I’d argue taking things away they like to do is much more effective as a punishment. It lasts longer, and unless you are giving your kid a serious beating, they won’t get over it in a few minutes like they would with physical punishment.</p>

<p>I concur. I’ve never been beaten, yet I see myself as someone who sticks to the rules. My parents did exactly that: they took away toys when I didn’t listen. They also didn’t flood me with toys. Spoiling isn’t good either. Spoiled children don’t appreciate the things they already own, which probably sticks to them the rest of their lives. Giving new toys and games is an easy way to keep your child quiet, but like drugs the ‘high’ gets shorter and shorter.</p>

        <p>I must admit the fear of getting a spanking is pretty much gone now that I know they wont do it anymore, but back then it was very effective. Now my parents use that method you are talking about now. As a little kid your attention span is so short losing a toy hardly means anything, whereas simply a threat of a spanking would scare the living daylights out of you.</p>

<p>the video showed a girl getting <em>slapped</em> with a belt. Not beaten, just slapped. She’ll be a little sore for a bit, but in a few days it will all be forgotten, and she sure as shit won’t do whatever thing she did to warrant the punishment.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>if you look at the video description:</p>
<blockquote>The judge's wife was emotionally abused herself and was severely manipulated into assisting the beating and should not be blamed for any content in this video. The judge's wife has since left the marriage [b]due to the abuse, which continues to this day[/b], and has sincerely apologized and repented for her part and for allowing such a thing, long before this video was even revealed to exist.</blockquote>
<p>whether or not you want to call it abuse or being “slapped” with a belt you have to draw the line somewhere, the wife and daughter obviously feel it was abuse (assuming the video description is accurate) and it wasn’t a one off experience</p>
<p>how about this, it isn’t necessarily the kid not wanting to accept the punishment, it’s more to do with the kid not wanting to be hit/slapped/lightly touched like a feather repeatedly several times with a belt, where such a punishment anywhere else in western society is against the law</p>

        <p>Heh so apparently when you knock a girl up you automatically become an expert on parenting because you are one? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>You can have kids once you’re sexually mature, and historically that was what happened. It’s only in the last 30 years that house prices and inflation skyrocketed making parenting a much more expensive task and less feasbile before ~30.</p>

<p>I think anyone here could parent, mainly because its an important part of education and we’re taught the basics in school, not to mention its completely instinctive anyway. I’m fairly certain everyone here was given a boiled egg baby as a kid at school.</p>
