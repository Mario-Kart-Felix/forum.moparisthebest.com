Of course you can’t judge someone by his or her job, but generally speaking it says a bit about their character, because character is one of the things that decides what job you end up doing. An introvert person usually doesn’t end up as a car salesman.</p>

              <p>Sure, the way you were brought up plays a major role in how you raise your own children. But I assume you can break that circle, and do it differently. For instance, my parents’ generation was still raised in a time when you could smack your child. Yet now it’s frowned upon by almost everyone, only a small part of parents still do.</p>
<p>I know this is a generalization, but here in the Netherlands you do see a lot of uneducated and low-income people use violence against their children. I know you don’t see education as something that makes you superior, Mopman. I agree, but being educated usually is a result of being raised differently (and I daresay a bit better). Dropouts, or people who don’t even try, usually don’t succeed at much else either. They prefer short term satisfaction over long term, and end up paving the road or fixing my sink. They have the same potential as those who do succeed, but they lack the drive to achieve.</p>
<p>(I say again, I’m generalizing here. There are exceptions, but on average I think I’m close to being right :P)</p>

<p>Yeah, it was only for a day at school. Was pretty funny because we all just broke them at first break time iirc so I guess it wasn’t an excellent teaching exercise. ;D</p>
<p>However it came accompanied with a lesson on “How to be parent”, not that I really remember any of it but I’m fairly sure most people should have experienced something like this at school, it seems rather important.</p>

<p>I think anyone here could parent, mainly because its an important part of education and we’re taught the basics in school, not to mention its completely instinctive anyway. I’m fairly certain everyone here was given a boiled egg baby as a kid at school.</p>

<p>You can have kids once you’re sexually mature, and historically that was what happened. It’s only in the last 30 years that house prices and inflation skyrocketed making parenting a much more expensive task and less feasbile before ~30.</p>

<p>the video showed a girl getting <em>slapped</em> with a belt. Not beaten, just slapped. She’ll be a little sore for a bit, but in a few days it will all be forgotten, and she sure as shit won’t do whatever thing she did to warrant the punishment.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>if you look at the video description:</p>
<blockquote>The judge's wife was emotionally abused herself and was severely manipulated into assisting the beating and should not be blamed for any content in this video. The judge's wife has since left the marriage [b]due to the abuse, which continues to this day[/b], and has sincerely apologized and repented for her part and for allowing such a thing, long before this video was even revealed to exist.</blockquote>
<p>whether or not you want to call it abuse or being “slapped” with a belt you have to draw the line somewhere, the wife and daughter obviously feel it was abuse (assuming the video description is accurate) and it wasn’t a one off experience</p>
<p>how about this, it isn’t necessarily the kid not wanting to accept the punishment, it’s more to do with the kid not wanting to be hit/slapped/lightly touched like a feather repeatedly several times with a belt, where such a punishment anywhere else in western society is against the law</p>
