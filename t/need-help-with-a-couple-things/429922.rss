    <description>i have a few questions.

1. how do i change my combat stats so max lvl is 206 but then i want to make it so prayer grows my lvl to so the overall combat lvl is 253. so i would like to make a command like ::prayer and it gives you bones to burry to grow your combat lvl. 

2. i also need somethign so when you kill someone pking it gives you a pk point. like a thing that comes up that says you now have 1 pk point, then if they kill someone else it comes up and say you now have 2 pk points.

3. ik this is some were on the forum but i tried it and it doesnt work, i want to put how many players is online and the name of my server on the top of the screen. and also a count down timer for reboots, so it tells when a reboots going to happen. i have the code and i added it but it doesnt stay on the top of the screen it disapears.

4. and i want it so when a player clicks on the dummys its grows there strenth lvl, and when they click the hay it grows there defence lvl and when they click the door it grows there att lvl. 

thanks.</description>
