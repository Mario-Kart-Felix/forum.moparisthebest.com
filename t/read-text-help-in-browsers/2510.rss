    <description>Ive been trying to use the  IsTextInAreaEx() function in Scar but have been having problems with its accuracy. Can somebody tell me if this is a reliable method of reading text from a webpage?

The project im currently working on is a script for neopets. I&#39;m intending to make it so that it will read in and save all of the stock market statistics to a file. I&#39;ve been having real trouble getting it to read any text at all and when i do get it working it seems to have trouble finding larger strings.

This is a link to the page i will be reading the data from : 
http://www.neopets.com/stockmarket.phtml?type=list&amp;full=true

If somebody could help show me how to get it to find the text in the &quot;Ticker&quot;, &quot;Curr&quot; and &quot;Change&quot; i&#39;l be able to finish this script and release it to everyone. An example of what im trying to do is this:

var theFont : Integer;

theFont := LoadCharsFromFont2(&#39;Times New Roman&#39;, 12, True, False, False, False);

if(IsTextInAreaEx(0, 0, 800, 600, x, y, &#39;AAVL&#39;, 10, theFont, False, True, 0, 0, -1))then
  begin
    Writeln(&#39;I found the AAVL stock!);    
  end

If anybody can help me modify the settings so that they work properly or show me how it is done using another function then il happily pay them in Neopoints for the help.</description>

<p>The only problem is that its very glitchy and struggles with many fonts. What i did was forced my web browser to use the style Courier New which is probably the easisest to read. I’ve managed to get it read all the data in now so im happy with that. The end result is a script that logs into any number of accounts you want and purchases stocks in what you tell it to. I would release this except TNT will catch on quickly if you have 20 accounts buying shares in under 10 minutes. So now im making an automatic proxy switcher that will change proxy before logging into a new account so they can’t link them together and freeze them all. If anybody has any idea’s then tell me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Im thinking about moving the script into VB6 or Delphi to get it working as an application.[/quote]</p>
