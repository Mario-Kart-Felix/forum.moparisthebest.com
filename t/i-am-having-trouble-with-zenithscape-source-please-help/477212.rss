    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-am-having-trouble-with-zenithscape-source-please-help/477212</link>
    <description>Does &quot;hjhkh&quot; also need to be compiled? when i click &quot;compile&quot; on both server side and client side, they both successfully finish compiling but when i log in to play the exp rate changes ive made havent changed and the staff team i made including myself being owner (king zenith still owner not my player) also didnt change. 

If more information is needed for anyone to help me out please tell me what to post.
Any help is greatly appreciated.</description>
