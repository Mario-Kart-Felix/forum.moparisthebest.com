    <title>[DELTA 317] - How to get out of a public void by clicking somewhere?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-317-how-to-get-out-of-a-public-void-by-clicking-somewhere/548631</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working on a custom afk system for a while now, and I almost have it perfected.

At the moment you go afk after being away for a few minutes, and sit in rocking chair, barber chair etc (object ids) which freezes you in place for basically a million seconds (I put it under case 202 so basically instead of logging out you go into afk mode). To get out, you have to type ::back which unfreezes you and deletes the chair object.

 I was wondering if any of you had some ideas as to how I could make it so all you have to do is click to unfreeze/delete the chair? Or to put it simply, How would I make it so clicking somewhere would enable my ::back command?

Thanks for Looking.</description>
