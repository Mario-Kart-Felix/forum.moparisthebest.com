    <title>Bone UN-Banker / Buryer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bone-un-banker-buryer/2250</link>
    <description>Hi, I am looking for a script that would open the bank and take out a full inventory of big bones then bury them. It should be fairly simple, but I know nothing about scripting for Aryan.

Incase anyone is wondering ... I bought about 4k big bones to put up my prayer lvl, but i don&#39;t want to sit there burying them all lol...  :)</description>
