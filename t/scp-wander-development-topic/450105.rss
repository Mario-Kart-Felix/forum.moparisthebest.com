[b]Story:[/b]
[QUOTE]After the recent Containment breach, and after they locked 106 back in his Container. You must now go visit 106 and try to ask where 173 went, he is highly dangerous. but in the middle of talking everything goes wrong and he attacks you sending you to his pocket dimension. somehow his pocket dimension malfunctions and sends you to a new land. This land is yours to explore.
Find 173, 106 and any other SCP you encounter back to their containers.[/QUOTE]
