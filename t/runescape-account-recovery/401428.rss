    <title>Runescape Account Recovery</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-account-recovery/401428</link>
    <description>Well. My level 101 runescape account with 90 dung and 175 mil on it got hacked.
A gay ass company named Fagex wont give it back.
I have every single detail about the account and still.. they say no.
I read the description why they are saying no and all it says is: &quot;We do not have enough info about this account&quot;
