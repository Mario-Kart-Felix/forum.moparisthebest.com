    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/online-sessions/433052</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m trying to create some sort of &quot;players online&quot; system using sessions. I&#39;ve read about it and it seems like they are limited to just the files in your directory. My solution was to store the online list in a database, like adding the player to the list when they have logged in, updating the time if they are already there and have clicked a new link, and deleting them if they log out. What if they time out? I thought of using dates and time, but the date and time formats perplex me. Could someone show me a good date and time format? Let&#39;s say the timeout time is 30 minutes.

<p>Probably not the most efficient. However, it works for me, and thank you all for your help.</p>
<p>Edit: Could you help me on my forms? I’m trying to reduce click time while users are typing and submitting repetitive forms. Is there a way to make the browser automatically direct to the particular form?</p>
<p>For example:<br>
Type a value in a field, press enter.<br>
You get a result. You can type in another value, press enter.<br>
Repeat. And all of this without clicking.</p>

Doesn’t have to be an RSPS. Since you’re trying to use “player” sessions, I’m assuming it’s for a game. Since you mentioned logging in, I’m assuming there’s a single server. With that information, my approach can easily be implemented.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s a web based game, and I don’t think your approach would suit it the best as I’ve never seen any actual usage of actual networking based bytes in PHP.[/quote]</p>
<p>As a web based game, then there must still be a server.</p>
<p>Anyways, it doesn’t have to be raw bytes, and it doesn’t have to be restriced to just the amount of players. You could send a string to the browser, something like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"players:" + players + " games:" + games;</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, you would have to be reading from a file ,or table in the database, both of which would require more resources. With a file, it would be the constant reading/writing to the harddrive (which wears down over time, in addition to the mechanical cost) and the SQL server would have the previous downfalls, in addition to the networking costs.</p>
<p>With the game server, it’s loaded in the RAM, which is much more efficient than mechanical exchanges.</p>

              <p>Store a session variable during login that stores the time at which the user times out, and then query to see whether they are timed out when the page reloads. You can use <a href="http://us.php.net/time" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">time()</a> to achieve this. Unix timestamps are based on milliseconds, so the timeout time would be [tt]time() + (30 * 60 * 1000)[/tt], for 30 minutes after the current time. You can update the variable for all activity the user does, so long as they don’t time out (that way it counts based on the last time the user is active).</p>
<p>I would be cautious not to go too long, though. There’s a point in which the session data will be marked as garbage, and the session will be considered close and all session data will be cleaned up. I believe a typical duration for this is around 30 minutes, so you may want to consider shorter time out periods unless you have access to your php.ini configuration file.</p>
