    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-webclient-maker-317-delta/439001</link>
    <description>been working on my rsps coding it lately, but i have no time to make a webclient tbh and i think it would be better if i had one, if some1s willing to make one for me lemme know, im not expecting it for free obv, im willing to pay either rsgp, or an admin spot on my server. im planning on yt adv so its not going to be a waste of time, its going to be a 24-7 vps hosted eventually once i get it going, so if interested lemme know, dont comment on here because i prob wont see it tbh, either email me, or add me on skype, ill put my contact info below. so if you can make a 317 delta rsps webclient shoot me a msg, thanks.
