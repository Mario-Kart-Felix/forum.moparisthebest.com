    <description>Got some probs here
My woodcutting and Mining worked fine
though since that worm ate some of my client 
They stopped working.
I have every Boolean/void added, Wasn&#39;t there A java file/Anything else
that made it work? or I just didn&#39;t add everything, dunno

Maybe add the voids/case/boolean name wich should get added, would help aswell</description>
