    <title>Could not save for player</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/could-not-save-for-player/326643</link>
    <description>Alright I am using Project 16 v6..
If anyone else has used or is using Project 16, when you go to log out the server does not automatically save your char.

so I would get a message in the batch file say something like:
[code]Could not save for player (PLAYERNAME)[/code]

So I went on and checked my Logout void, here is what I found...

[code]
	public void logout(){
		outStream.createFrame(109);
	}[/code]

I saw that there was nothing used to save the character so I added proj16&#39;s current/default save void in there which is  savechar();  and savemoreinfo();

something like this:
[code]
	public void logout(){
                savechar();
                savemoreinfo();
		outStream.createFrame(109);
	}[/code]
I recieved no error&#39;s but the server continued to not save players that log out.

Anyone know how I could fix this?

Thanks,
