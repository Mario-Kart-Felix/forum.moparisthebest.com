    <description>[code]---Project16 V.6 by Wolf |-Enabled-| ---
ClientHandler: Accepted from localhost:3937
tester is signing onto server.
Could not save for tester
ClientHandler: Client tester disconnected.
ClientHandler: Accepted from localhost:3938
tester is signing onto server.
[client-1-tester]: playerCommand: pitsroom
Could not save for tester
ClientHandler: Client tester disconnected.
[/code]

As you can see I am using Project 16 v6.. 
I was just wondering how I could make it so that the player would save if s/he were to disconnect.  
I have already tried to add the current default save which is savechar() and savemoreinfo() to public void logout,  But it still wouldn&#39;t save??

Thanks,
