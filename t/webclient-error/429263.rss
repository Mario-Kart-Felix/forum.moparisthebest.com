    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-error/429263</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, so i have been working on my webclient for the past couple days and i have finally got part of it to work.. (before it would just white screen)
But anyways... now i can&#39;t figure out what i am doing wrong. The cache has already downloaded, but then after it did that this happened...
