    <title>Webclient error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-error/422151</link>
    <description>im using insidia, if i maked the webclient and put it on my site, it loads perfect for me. But other players will get an &quot;error loading..&quot;
message, I guess its because it dont download the cache to the right place when it loads, or it even doesnt download it.
Does someone know how to make this?
So it will download the cache when you want to load the webclient?</description>
