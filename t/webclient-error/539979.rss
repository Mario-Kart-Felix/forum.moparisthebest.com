    <title>Webclient Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-error/539979</link>
    <description>Hello,
My RSPS has had a webclient for years, however with the new java update (Java 7 Update 51) they are locking down on security heavier, here&#39;s an article:
https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_blocked.xml
Thus this creates a problem with my webclient because (clearly) in the article it says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The new version of Java does not allow users to run the applications that are not signed (Unsigned), Self signed (not signed by trusted authority) and the applications that are missing permission attributes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So how do I get around this, because it&#39;s not letting me run the webclient, I&#39;d rather not have my users change their settings as i do not want to be seen as a virus.</description>
