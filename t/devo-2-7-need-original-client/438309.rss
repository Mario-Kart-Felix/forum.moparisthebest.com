    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/devo-2-7-need-original-client/438309</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I was just wondering if anyone had the original client that Killamess used with Devo 2.7. I&#39;ve searched through the forums and the internet ,I can&#39;t seem to find a download. If anyone has a download link, I would really appreciate the help.
Thank you!</description>

              <p>Hey man, I was just wondering if you had taken the time to read the sectional rules for the Server Help board, I don’t think you have. If you could please read them, I would really appreciate it. Thank you!</p>
<blockquote>All topics in this section must be requests for help on a server. Any non-server related questions will be locked. Requesting a host, 'coder'/programmer, server or client, or asking about a VPS also falls under being non-server related. That means for other sections on this site too.</blockquote>
