              <p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:2, topic:546011”]Max hit shouldn’t be a static number. It should be based on the stats of the weapon. Meaning a weapon with +20 str would do better than one with +15 (not counting other variables etc). Because if you made each one have a max, even if your player was “geared through the teeth” he wouldn’t be able to hit his max number because the staff only allows you to hit like 25 or etc.</p>
<p>I’d look into where your server handles magic damage so you can get an idea how it works.[/quote]</p>
<p>Good thing I dont have that then lol, I’ll try increasing the magic bonus for it and Ill see if that works.</p>
