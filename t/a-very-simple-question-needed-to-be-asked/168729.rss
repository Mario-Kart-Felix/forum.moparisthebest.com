              <p>No,I think you typed in your default getaway(192.168.0.1),and your computer’s IP.If you want to know your computer’s IP, open a command prompt then type in ipconfig , hit enter , and it will show up your internal adress or idk what is it’s name.<br>

              <p>ok it looks as if you are forwarding your port to 192.168.1.1 that is your routers ip addres(internal) so what you need to do if forward the port to YOUR computers ip address you can find this by going into cmd(command prompt) by going start_run then type cmd and press enter (may be different on vista but then you type ipconfig andpress enter then at IP Address: it will have your ip address type that in the routers form and its a goa BUT this is if you allready have a static ip address for your computer  that is too much to explain here so visit <a href="http://www.portforward.com/default.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.portforward.com/default.htm</a> and click portforwarding and it will have alll you need to know there<br>
ps: sorry about all the broken words i tend to type fasly lol &lt;- fastly<br>
thanks and hope this helps<br>
