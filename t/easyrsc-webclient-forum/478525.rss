    <title>EasyRSC webclient / Forum?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/easyrsc-webclient-forum/478525</link>
    <description>Okay, I know it&#39;s a txt file based server but is there any way to convert it? Like what files should I edit in order to convert it, I understand SQL &amp; PHP, FTP, Host&#39;s, etc.. like that just not very good with what files to edit yet in EasyRSC.

I want to be able to make a forum, have people register and use their forum name to login and have the ability to use a web client if they want... But the thing is I dont know where to connect any of this together, so I have no approach any help would be great, I googled, I searched and I found good stuff... pre-made stuff kind of but connecting the two I dont understand?</description>
