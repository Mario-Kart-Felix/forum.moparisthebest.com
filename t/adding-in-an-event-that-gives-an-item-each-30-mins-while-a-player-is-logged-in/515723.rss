    <description>Im trying to add a system where each 30 mins of a player playing they will recieve an item, i want to do this so i can give each player a double spin ticket each 30 mins of them playing. This is because i dont know how to change the timer on squeal from 24h to 30 mins. Thank you if you will help :)</description>
