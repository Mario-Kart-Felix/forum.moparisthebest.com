    <title>Server All Ready, Portforwarding Stopping Me, Tried 1M Things!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-all-ready-portforwarding-stopping-me-tried-1m-things/361203</link>
    <description>Okay so 1 million things is a little OTT. But seriously I&#39;m getting so annoyed at this.

First off, I don&#39;t have a client. I&#39;m trying to connect using MoparScape. Should work no?

Right, now I&#39;ll cut to the chase.

When I run MoparScape and try to connect to my server through my no-ip link, it won&#39;t let me. BTW: Yes I&#39;m running a listen server, not dedicated.

Any time I try this, I get the error message:

Error connecting to server. Must be down.Click &quot;Cancel&quot; and then &quot;Start Server&quot; to make your own.

This is nonsense. My server is up, it just can&#39;t connect :)

[size=12pt]Here are a few screen shots I have, some will be missing information, but that is because I do not intend to publicise my IP address, MAC address or any other information. :P[/size]

[IMG]http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/3620/19414718.png[/img]
Here you can clearly see that my internal IP address is 192.168.1.65, most of you know what subnet I have now &gt;.&gt;

But you can also see my host name, &quot;AIRO&quot; and that the server is also running.

Moving on ...

[IMG]http://img696.imageshack.us/img696/5508/71851337.png[/img]
In this screen shot, you can see my router&#39;s settings, not all of them :P

You can see that Relentless and RS are being forwarded to my host name. We only need to worry about the latter of the two, &quot;RS&quot;.

[IMG]http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/1682/66359843.png[/img]
Here is a screen shot of RS&#39;s settings. As you can see it forwards port 43594 to my host name. This is the port that my server is using.

[IMG]http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/6839/29030293.png[/img]
This is a screen shot of MoparScape failing to connect to the server using my no-ip.

[IMG]http://img840.imageshack.us/img840/7049/38353374.png[/img]
And finally this is my no ip. Without an IP address, because I don&#39;t need you seeing that :P Trust me, I know it&#39;s correct, I&#39;ve tried pinging it and had a &lt;1ms response.
[hr]

With all that done, I can&#39;t see any errors. Can anyone help me?

Note: I can connect to the client using my internal IP address, loopback address (127.0.0.1) and localhost but not my external IP address or my no-ip.</description>

<p>I was going to try this, but I’m not sure what client to use. I’ve just switched to Emulous 1.7 instead of Project16.

</aside>
<p>I have thought about this, the only problem is that I really do not want a static IP address. I am a listen server, and as such if the server was running I would also be doing other things.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, port forwarding as I have done should work fine. As I have no-ip’s client it will update if the server ever goes offline. Having a dynamic IP address will only change if my router loses it’s connection or my computer is switched off. Neither of these are likely once my server is running.</p>
