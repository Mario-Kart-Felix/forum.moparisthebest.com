    <title>What do you look for in PKing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-look-for-in-pking/451323</link>
    <description>Just wondering... What do you guys look for when you want to PK on a server...
What I currently have:
1. Fast switching
2. Clipping
3. Better combat then the default PI combat

Those are some things that I have off the top of my head... Please shoot some more my way!</description>

Of course they do, however that doesn’t mean a person in rune can’t beat a person in torva, it just means that it’s less likely for the guy in torva will get hit.  Boosts basically just make it so you have more chances to hit, but it’s still almost completely random on whether you hit or not.</p>

Noobs I can kill.</p>
<p>Anndd I also look for servers that if they have those overpowered items, nobody can get them in a day, maybe if it took like a week or two to even get one, that’d be fine.<br>
[/quote]I’m planning on having it a challenging way to get. One thing is that forcenthy dungeon thingy (I’m not sure if that’s right or not) that’s a PK area, so that way it’s going to be harder to get PvP Armors. Also for Chaotics, I’m not sure if I’m just going to have them for donations, or if I’m going to add dungeoneering. Donations would be good, cause only certain people would want to donate, so that would sieve out 1000’s of people having it, but Dungeoneering would be a more unique way of doing things and more fun. Would be harder to get of course :P[/quote]<br>
Yeah, it’s the forinthry dungeon (I think?). Also, I think donating for chaotics is a good idea. All of them are very powerful, and it would be a good perk for donating.</p>

I can agree with the prodding thing.  In so many servers, I always get attacked instantly by the rich bastards with 100 sets of statius and chaotic mauls who think they’re “pro pkers” because they get lucky hits.<br>

The hits aren’t lucky, its the general fact that in most servers those items are overpowered  :P[/quote]<br>
It’s the fact that most servers have terrible combat accuracies.</p>
