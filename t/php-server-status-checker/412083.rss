    <title>PHP Server Status Checker?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/php-server-status-checker/412083</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to find a WORKING one for 3 hours now.

A simple PHP script (Or JavaScript script) that checks if your server is online or offline, and displays &quot;Online&quot; or &quot;Offline&quot;

I&#39;ve seen it on some server&#39;s websites, and I do not want to have to use the one from MoparScape or Rune-Server etc, because I want multiple ones for different ports..

It seems simple, but I cannot find a working one. I have tried about every script possible to be found on Google and none of them work. Please do not post if you do not have a working script that you have proven to yourself that it works.

Thanks for any help. I will Rep</description>
