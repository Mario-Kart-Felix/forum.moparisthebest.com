    <title>The Outsider - Albert Camus</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-outsider-albert-camus/267407</link>
    <description>Anyone read this book? It&#39;s translated from french and was written some time in the 1940s. I thought it was pretty good, it&#39;s quite short too.

I guess I wont waste a long time talking about this book because I doubt anyone will ever read this thread as nobody seems to read anymore. I thought it was really quite a touching story.</description>

<p>Being quite short, how many pages approx? Because, I doubt that I will finish the book if it’s over 250.[/quote]<br>
117 pages, and the font is quite large too.</p>
