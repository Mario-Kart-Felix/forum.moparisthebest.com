    <description>This module has to be loaded when you browse to the rs webpage with a client window on it, it will take the client window and put in onto ur form.

[code]&#39;The constants we are going to use
Public Const SWP_NOSIZE = &amp;H1
Public Const HWND_TOP = 0
Public Const SWP_NOOWNERZORDER = &amp;H200
Declare Function FindWindowEx Lib &quot;user32&quot; Alias &quot;FindWindowExA&quot; (ByVal hWnd1 As Long, ByVal hWnd2 As Long, ByVal lpsz1 As String, ByVal lpsz2 As String) As Long
Declare Function SetWindowPos Lib &quot;user32&quot; (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal hWndInsertAfter As Long, ByVal X As Long, ByVal Y As Long, ByVal cx As Long, ByVal cy As Long, ByVal wFlags As Long) As Long
Declare Function SetParent Lib &quot;user32&quot; (ByVal hWndChild As Long, ByVal hWndNewParent As Long) As Long

Sub StealRS(frm As Form, Optional X As Long = 0, Optional Y As Long = 0) &#39;Finds the rs hwnd and then sets it to be on the form
On Error Resume Next
thunderformdc&amp; = frm.hwnd &#39;This is the start point (this form)
shellembedding&amp; = FindWindowEx(thunderformdc&amp;, 0&amp;, &quot;shell embedding&quot;, vbNullString)
shelldocobjectview&amp; = FindWindowEx(shellembedding&amp;, 0&amp;, &quot;shell docobject view&quot;, vbNullString) &#39;These are the steps to the rs hwnd
internetexplorerserver&amp; = FindWindowEx(shelldocobjectview&amp;, 0&amp;, &quot;internet explorer_server&quot;, vbNullString)
microsoftvmforjavatmhostwindowclass&amp; = FindWindowEx(internetexplorerserver&amp;, 0&amp;, &quot;microsoft vm for java(tm) host window class&quot;, vbNullString)
&#39;This one is Poonscape
RSHwnd&amp; = FindWindowEx(microsoftvmforjavatmhostwindowclass&amp;, 0&amp;, &quot;msawt_comp_class&quot;, vbNullString)
&#39;Sets the parent of the Poonscape applet to be the form
SetParent RSHwnd, frm.hwnd
&#39;Pause until the has finished
DoEvents
&#39;Try to find the new rs window
RSHwnd&amp; = FindWindowEx(frm.hwnd, 0&amp;, &quot;msawt_comp_class&quot;, vbNullString)
&#39;If not found exit
If RSHwnd = 0 Then Exit Sub
&#39;Window found so set it to be where we want it to be.
&#39;In this case i set it to be the top left of the form.

&#39;SWP_NOOWNERZORDER Or SWP_NOSIZE means we want it to ignore the resizeing
&#39;and not to affect the order
Call SetWindowPos(RSHwnd, HWND_TOP, X, Y, 0, 0, SWP_NOOWNERZORDER Or SWP_NOSIZE)
End Sub[/code]

This Sub was not written by my (dunno who wrote it) I did asjust it a bit for easier usage.

You should call on it like this:
[code]Private Sub YourWebBrowser_ProgressChange(ByVal progress As Long, ByVal ProgressMax As Long)
    On Error Resume Next
    StealRS Me, X, Y
End Sub[/code]</description>
