    <title>[SOLVED] Does anyone know the basic stab emote for a Dragon dagger?</title>

    <description>Hi. Im currently coding special attacks into my server.
I&#39;ve added the whip spec, and now I&#39;m working on the Dragon dagger.
The only problem is, I hadn&#39;t noticed, my dragon daggers always swing twice, but only hit once. 
I was wondering if someone could tell me the emote id for either
• The basic Dragon dagger stab, where the character leans forward with his/her arm outstretched, or
• The alternate dragon dagger attack, where the character swings the dagger at thier opponent from the upper right hand side.

If anyone has the emote ids for either of the above, please let me know via reply to this topic.
