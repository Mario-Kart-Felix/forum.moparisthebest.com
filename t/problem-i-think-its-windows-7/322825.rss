    <title>Problem i think its Windows 7 :[]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-i-think-its-windows-7/322825</link>
    <description>Hello I cant provide pictures but i can explain my problem.
I have made lots of servers but when i got my new laptop for christmas and went to make a new server on it i kept running into problems

First problem was after i downloaded the lastest JDK (16) I went to compiler kept saying JDK could not be found so i uninstalled and reinstalled same thing.
Then i went to run my server and it says JAVA could not be found

Also i try to portforward by typing my PC IPv4 IP in the URL and it keeps saying problem diagnose here.


So...

I guess i can&#39;t portforward please PLEASE HELP ME!</description>

              <p>jdk problem is easy.<br>
Edit your compile.bat and you will see 2 addresses at the top<br>
They are supposed to be the location of your jdk. You have to fix it to look like set pro=%programfiles%\Java\jdk1.6.0_16&lt;---- Last # must be your java update #…</p>
<p>EDIT</p>
<p>I can help you via team-viewer if you need.</p>
