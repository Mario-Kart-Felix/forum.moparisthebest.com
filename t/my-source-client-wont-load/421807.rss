    <description>NOTE- I HAVE JDK VERSION 7, I DOWNLOADED THE &quot;WINDOWS X86 VERSION BUT I CHECK ON MY COMPUTER PROPERTIES AND IT SAID 64-BIT OPERATING SYSTEM. SO SHOULD I UNINSTALL THE X86 VERSION AND DOWNLOAD THE WINDOWS X64 VERSION? 
(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u1-download-513651.html)
- ALSO INSTEAD OF USING WINRAR I USED WINZIP. - MY COMPUTER MANUFACTER IS TOSHIBA
-WINDOWS EDITION : WINDOWS VISTA HOME PREMIUM

1.) ok i looked on google and found a good guide (i belive) http://forum.ragezone.com/f365/make-rsps-603179/ (not to be advatising)
ok once you looked on the site and see what i see. you will understand better. i did exactly what it said on the site except for portforwarding and doing the no-ip thingy. but i download the source testscape and i copy and paste the information provided on the site exactly on the testscape compile and runeserver. i clicked on edit and paste exactly what was on the site. 
but when i did all that my source wouldnt work...
when i double click on compile this is what i get 
&quot;Note: stream.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
Starting TestScape Server on 0.0.0.0:43594&quot;

this is what i edited inside of compile 
&quot;@echo off
title ArmyNation
color 3b
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_01\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp . *.java
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_01\bin\java.exe&quot; server
pause&quot;



2.) also i download client source &quot;testscape&quot; that was on the site also and when i double click on source this is what i get 
&quot;Starting TestScape Server on 0.0.0.0:43594&quot; 

this is what i edited inside on &quot;runserver&quot;
&quot;@echo off
title ArmyNation
color 3b
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_01\bin\java.exe&quot; server
