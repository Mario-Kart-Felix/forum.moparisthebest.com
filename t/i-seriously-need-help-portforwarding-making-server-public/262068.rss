    <title>I seriously need help, (Portforwarding., making server public)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-seriously-need-help-portforwarding-making-server-public/262068</link>
    <description>Okay I don&#39;t understand. When I manage my no-ip host it takes me to the no-ip site and then has an ip like (68....) But when I type my server IP into my search bar it it takes me to my Routers website homepage..Then once I click portforwarding it has &quot;RunescapeServer&quot; but the ip is something like 192...

I am trying to make my  client  public. I understand how to make it download able but whenever people try logging on they cant but I can. Also my ports arnt forwarded somehow, but that runescapeserver thing is in my port forwarding section but somehow I still didn&#39;t forward.
Please Help me Make my client public.
When you read this your probly confused so just add my MSN and chat with me I&#39;ll explain more thoroughly.
