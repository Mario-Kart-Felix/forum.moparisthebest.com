    <title>Hotmail - Cant unblock</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hotmail-cant-unblock/410567</link>
    <description>No, I do not mean unblocking a user from messaging me. My AOL and Hotmail emails were both hacked shortly after I arrived at work today. To stop whoever from sending out any more spam emails they blocked my account from the messenger and able to send out emails. I can click &quot;verify my account&quot;, but I have one [b]major[/b] issue here. My carrier is not supported under there. I have Cellular South for my cell phone, as well as a Google Voice number for when I want to freak people out a bit. I have tried both of these under all of the options and neither receive the SMS verification code.

Is there another way that I am just not seeing to be able to verify my account? I have an alternate email setup. I know that it is working there because it asks me to verify it with an email that was sent there to any change to my profile.</description>

<p>Nope, the only option it gives me is to send an SMS text to my mobile phone.</p>

<p>Problem is, the school I am planning to attend has that email on record. It is <span class="bbcode-b">very</span> difficult getting the counselor on the phone (have been trying since it got blocked), so the issue is, this email has become rather important lol.</p>
