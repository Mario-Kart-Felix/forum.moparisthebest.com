    <title>ERROR CONNECTING! Again =[</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-again/452132</link>
    <description>in the client folder i changed the servers ip into my no-ip and compiled so that other people can join it , however that didnt work.. i had my no-ip up and still didnt work .

the client for me works as i have changed mine to local host 127.0.0.1 i told my friend who was testing the client for me he said when he clicked on run client an error message popped up and then turned off and he couldnt go on it.

how come he cannot go on it? any ideas?</description>
