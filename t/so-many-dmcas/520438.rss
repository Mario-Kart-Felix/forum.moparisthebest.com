    <title>So many DMCA&#39;s!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-many-dmcas/520438</link>
    <description>So wow..it amazes me how many DMCA&#39;s are being sent these days. I had put up a new fresh mediafire link for my FR release an hour before I went to bed and it&#39;s suspended/deleted now. That&#39;s insane that&#39;s like less than ten hours and I didn&#39;t even give anybody the link!

Is Jagex really going to cut us down to size by just DMCA&#39;ing us to death/</description>

<p>Why would they buy it out? It is functioning fine, growing, and earning money. Buying it out would be a risky investment because JaGeX have little experience in private servers and there is no need to buy it out. Instead, they simply say “give us … percent of your income, and we wont shut you down” - there is no risk, and they make pure profit with no expenses, where as if they were to buy it out/sue them there is risk involved.</p>

I really do think there’s been some form of deal struck up. I mean, soulsplit’s office has an easy 30 computers in it. A company with 30 employees at least that is taking their entire idea and players directly from another game (bearing in mind RS has 400~ employees) is pretty much unheard of.</p>
