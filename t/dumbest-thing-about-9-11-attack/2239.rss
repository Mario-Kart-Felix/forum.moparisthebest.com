    <description>Ok...
I&#39;m a republican and I was reading in the paper that the new movie coming out( not flight 93) but another bush bashing movie said that the two towers were hit with missiles launched by bush himself...
Well... Looks like a plane to me!

Well maybe, maybe not. If he did do it (I’m not saying he did- I’m republican) it could be so that he could look like a hero, and it wouldn’t be random because September 11 = 9/11 = 911, maybe he wanted it to look like a coincidence(sp?).[br][size=1]Posted at: 01 May 2006, 13:12:51[/size][hr][quote=“Razorlike, post:13, topic:2239”]<span class="bbcode-s">to have a reason to start a war…</span><br>

              <p>problem is, of course if there WAS a missle (ive no idea) do u think bush would scream it loud that it was him? of course not.  he would try to hide it and/or brain wash everyone.  watch fareghit 9/11.  very informative.  also there not sure whether or not those planes could bring down the building, theres talk of bombs in the bottom to give it sctructual damage.  also, how do u explain the fact that bush had planes and missles primed and ready to launch the moment anyone gets outa line, but 20 minutes l8er they still arent launched after it was CLEAR that these planes were hijacked?  i think theres something fishy goin on.  dont know what it is, not sure i want to know.  i just want to make sure im not being brainwashed.  <em>also</em>  the war in iraq is pointless, there was no threat, bush just wants oil.</p>

              <p>Sorry if what I was saying wasn’t clear, I meant a missle on the bottom of the plane.  So…a normal plane, with a missle on the bottom.  I don’t personally buy that theory, because I’m pretty sure airport security would’ve noticed a missle on a plane…</p>

              <p>Theres actualy lots of videos you can watch showing the explosion before the point of impact, and some quite interesting pictures of what the pentagon looked like, and how the hole looked like it came from anything but a plane.  Also, theres footage of the bottom of the planes with things on them that should be on a normal Boeing plan (missles?).  I havn’t really done enough research to have an educated opinion on this, but there are some pretty interesting theorys about it.</p>

I’m a republican and I was reading in the paper that the new movie coming out( not flight 93) but another bush bashing movie said that the two towers were hit with missiles launched by bush himself…<br>
Well… Looks like a plane to me!<br>
