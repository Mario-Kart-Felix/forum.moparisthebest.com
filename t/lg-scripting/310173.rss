    <description>Ok well LG stands for Leetgaming as in a site (.org) the site is based around private servers Rs, WoW, CS etc. (Offical servers only) So I dedicided to start with a Runescape Server first. what this will consist of is a base server that is an economy like the real Rs. Admins wont beable to trade get items etc like on the real rs. There will be no commands what so ever for cheats easy items and things etc...(Respond to this if you think its good)


Ok well we will have many Mini-Games Working Emotions, Specials, Poisons, Skill Capes, etc.

[b]Mini Games[/b]

[ul][li]Clan Wars (Arena teams clan vs clan not like on rs)[/li]
[li]Capture the Flag[/li]
[li]Castle Wars[/li]
[li]War Arena[/li]
[li]Pest Control[/li][/ul]


If someone would like to link a base and client (508) that has nothing on it I would be thankful. Because that is what we are going to be using....Also we will need a VPS so if someone would like to Donate Cash or a VPS that would be great to. Now than there will be a few types 

[b]Client Coder
Model Maker
Server Coder
Mini Game Coder
Website Maintaince[/b]

To prove you can actually do any of the above please provide info on here about it to prive it. Or if you dont want to share it with anyone please contact my msn at enzroc21@hotmail.com


If you would like to give suggestions also post here or contact my msn remember we are doing this for you guys so be thankful!


[b]Some more things about whats going to happen to the server[/b]

Will have real economy
Will have real stats like real rs
Will have some different weapons than on rs
Wont be a Trade Balance
WONT BE LAGGY!!!




Beta Keys will be given out sometime this month or next....Depends how fast we get this setup etc....





[b]Some things that might happen[/b]
Also we may make an island just for Donators over 50 USD they will have a green crown by their name they may get easier stats because no one will be there to hog it things might respawn faster and more centered economy on this island cheaper things etc.

Tournamenets to see who the best players are they get to choose any weapon etc they want and use it. Will all have same stats so its more fair.

More to be added to this thread later.</description>
