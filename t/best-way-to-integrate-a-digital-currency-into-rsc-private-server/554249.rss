    <title>Best way to integrate a digital currency into rsc private server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-way-to-integrate-a-digital-currency-into-rsc-private-server/554249</link>
    <description>This all stemmed from an idea i had about a year ago to create a digital currency like bitcoin but specifically for use as an in-game currency and called it GoldPieces/GP. One idea led to another and here I am, setting up a classic server to hopefully successfully integrate a digital currency (https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-GP) into and run well, though I still have much to do and learn. 

I used this server: https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/

So here&#39;s my idea of how to go about this thus far

VPS 1: GP Server Software
VPS 2: RSC Server
Webserver For Website

In the bank of the game there would be a generate address button, This would query VPS1 for a deposit address and send a callback when funds were received and confirmed, then to be credited to the account.

The only thing i&#39;m worried about is drops/selling in shops etc. My solutions are to make 1GP equal to 1000coins or to remove coin drops/ ways for people to get coins other than player to player trading etc. 

So what I would need to know is how to make sure people cannot get coins from the game that aren&#39;t from other people basically for now to keep the economy somewhat workable.</description>

              <p>There are plenty of sources around here that ‘work’. The problem is that everything is built on RSCDv25 resulting in overly bloated sources. Everything that is public is behind.</p>
<p>You should learn about the game client and server using EasyRSC and after you’re familiar with the code base and some of its problems move on to make something different. Ex : Take a look at the hassle it takes to implement a new spell, object, prayer etc on RSCD</p>

<p>I think the best way like you said would be to have the economy as normal and then on the servers website have a basic buy and sell orderbook so people can trade coins for GP/Bitcoin and set the currencies price. Have you ever run a RSC private server? What do you think about the MoparClassic as a code base?</p>
<p>I’m teaching myself, a lot of people are saying it’s not worth it but i’d really like to run a RSC server with integrated digital currency. I’m thinking of making all the quests original to make it more likely to attract a new player base even from people who have played and are tired of classic.<br>

I played with rsc servers years ago long before moparclassic. However I know Lothy was at one time working on a rsc server I don’t know if he ever finished it but from what I remember the source looked pretty solid.[/quote]</p>

<p>That is Lothy’s server but it is far from finished. Also i remember about 7 years ago when you made a server i believe with frank_'s source. Good times.</p>

              <p>This all stemmed from an idea i had about a year ago to create a digital currency like bitcoin but specifically for use as an in-game currency and called it GoldPieces/GP. One idea led to another and here I am, setting up a classic server to hopefully successfully integrate a digital currency (<a href="https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-GP" rel="nofollow noopener">https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-GP</a>) into and run well, though I still have much to do and learn.</p>
<p>I used this server: <a href="https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/</a></p>
<p>So here’s my idea of how to go about this thus far</p>
<p>VPS 1: GP Server Software<br>
VPS 2: RSC Server<br>
Webserver For Website</p>
<p>In the bank of the game there would be a generate address button, This would query VPS1 for a deposit address and send a callback when funds were received and confirmed, then to be credited to the account.</p>
<p>The only thing i’m worried about is drops/selling in shops etc. My solutions are to make 1GP equal to 1000coins or to remove coin drops/ ways for people to get coins other than player to player trading etc.</p>
<p>So what I would need to know is how to make sure people cannot get coins from the game that aren’t from other people basically for now to keep the economy somewhat workable.</p>
