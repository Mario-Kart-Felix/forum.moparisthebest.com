    <title>Shops and Drops [562 server/602 Client]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shops-and-drops-562-server-602-client/379148</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;ve got a few problems. I&#39;m running a 562 Server and a 602 Client. Everything runs fine except for a few issues.

First off: Shops

It seems that after some time playing, when you trade an NPC, all the items in the shop will disappear. For about half a second they will appear but then disappear. The only fix I can determine so far is to completely close the client and open it fresh. Anyone have any clue how to fix this bug?

Second: Drops

After some time training, eventually monsters will stop dropping items and registering as kills (for barrows). Again the only fix I could find it to completely restart the client and open a fresh one. Any thoughts?

Also one last think. When picking up an Item or trading an npc, you have to walk over the item or directly beside the NPC to pickup or trade. If you are far away, one click will move your character to the item/NPC then another will pickup/trade. Has anyone figured out how to make it so a single click will pick up an item without having to click it again? Same for the NPC trade requests.

All help would be appreciated! Thanks guys!  :)</description>

              <p>Problem Client or Server Sided: Server</p>
<p>Fixable: Of course… it’s a RSPS, everything is customizable xO</p>
<p>Note: Most of these “problems” occur in NoszScape’s source.</p>
<p>1.) The Shops Problem</p>
<h2>Your Shops are going blank due too an interface not closing properly. Say Players open the Price Checker (if added too your server), and then they close it, apparently, it doesn’t close correctly, and when you go too open your Shops, it causes them too go blank. This isn’t a client issue, it can be solved by figuring whats causing your interface problem.</h2>
<p>2.) Your Drops Problem</p>
<p>This is being caused because it’s an anti-dupe. Most servers (mostly Caelums base), have a DDM.  (Drop-Duplication-Method). It’s explained by</p>
<p>-&gt; Player stands next too a bank (any tile really).<br>
-&gt; Player withdraws the item, (you need 2 items. Stackable or noted.)<br>
-&gt; Player drops the items.<br>
-&gt; Player picks up the items.<br>
-&gt; Player banks the items, then withdraws just one of the item they dropped.<br>
-&gt; Re-Drop the item on the same spot you dropped the previous items, pick it up and it should be duped.</p>
<p>The drop thing is just basically an anti-dupe. I’d advise you too keep it unless you have another fix for this. (Making the items disappear on drops isn’t really a fix, it pisses off players because doing a drop-party, and they watch their 2B worth item get dropped with a gay message saying “tee-hee, no dupey for you <em>anal raped</em>”).</p>

YEah, so you might need to delete your present shop codes and re-do them. I don’t butbeforeyou delete any files/codes always make a backup.</p>
