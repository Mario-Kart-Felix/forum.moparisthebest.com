    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-bank-tabs-for-items-d/358496</link>
    <description>i&#39;m not quite sure how to go about adding bank tabs. i have the &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; but not the box with the &quot;+&quot; that you slide the items into to make new tabs. is this an easy thing to do or tough? if its a tougher thing to do i wont bother with it, its not a big deal. i was just curious and if i can do it i will. i dont even know where to look lol. i just need a little &quot;push&quot; and i can go for it.</description>
