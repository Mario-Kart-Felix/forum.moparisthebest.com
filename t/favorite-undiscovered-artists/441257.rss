          <blockquote>
              <p>I read a book called blink which introduced me to Kenna.</p>
<p>This isn’t a quote from the book, the book elaborates on how U2’s manager says “This guy right here, he is going to go on and great things, he is the next big thing” and the book elaborates on why Kennas career never launched.</p>
<blockquote>Kenna Zemedkun has advantages that would have other unknown singers gnawing their Converse sneakers with envy. The album he's about to release, Make Sure They See My Face, was co-produced by his famous high-school friend, Chad Hugo of the Neptunes, his fans include bigwigs such as U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, and MTV2 played one of his early videos 475 times, at viewers' request. Added to that, he's got articulacy, looks and an addictive 80s-meets-00s electro-rockiness that he modestly describes as "timeless but pushing boundaries". And he featured on Mark Ronson's Version album, singing the song Amy. He's exactly the kind of credible-but-commercial proposition that should sell itself. So why does his record company see the task of breaking him as a major challenge?
<p>The answer reveals itself in a comment recently posted on YouTube by someone called Killahfam69, who watched the video for his new single, Say Goodbye to Love. Killahfam69 was disdainful: “I just thought he was white. I am a black guy, and not many black people like this music.” There’s the problem: Kenna confuses people. Apparently, he’s too black for white audiences, not black enough for black ones.</p>
<p>He encountered the same attitude in 2003, when he released his debut album, New Sacred Cow, also produced by Hugo. Despite the Neptunes connection, it was too genre-defying to get airplay on American radio - neither urban nor rock stations would take a punt on it - and it flopped. Five years later, he’s still unclassifiable.</p>
<p>An Ethiopian whose parents emigrated to Virginia when he was three, he’s run up against the same brick wall since he started writing songs in his late teens. Despite growing up in a city where hip-hop poured from every doorway, he was unmoved by music till a neighbour gave him a tape of U2’s The Joshua Tree and told him to take it home and listen to it. He was wowed, and since that day, his heart has lain in a particularly crunchy strand of synth-rock, which complements his coiled, yearning voice. It’s the sound, he says, of “living between two worlds”.</p>
<p>But what makes Kenna really stand out in his not exactly crowded field is that he’s the only aspiring musician who’s been the subject of a chapter in a best-selling sociological tome. When Canadian journalist Malcolm Gladwell was writing the follow-up to his highly influential 2000 essay on trends, The Tipping Point, he decided that Kenna’s situation illustrated the premise of the new book Blink, which studied the effect of using gut instinct to make decisions. Gladwell reckoned that Kenna was a great example: he was loved by major players such as McGuinness, but radio programmers and the Killahfam69s of the world just didn’t get him - so whose gut was “right”? The chapter headed Kenna’s Dilemma tried to answer the question. (Its conclusion was that the programmers and haters had been unnerved by Kenna’s unique style into making the “wrong” snap decision.)</p>
<p>I asked Gladwell to predict whether he’d be better received in Britain, with its more liberal view of cross-genre music. “One of Kenna’s great frustrations in the United States, as I argued in Blink, was that his music can’t be easily pigeon-holed,” he replied, via email. “He doesn’t fit easily into existing categories, and in a popular music culture that is as segregated and traditional as America is, that’s a problem. I don’t mean segregated racially, but culturally. You will never hear Wilco and Jay-Z on the same station even though lots of people listen to both Wilco and Jay-Z (like me). But my sense of England is that those strict boundaries between genres don’t matter nearly as much. That makes me think Kenna’s music is far less problematic to the musical community over there than here.”</p>
<p>Kenna is hoping he’s right. “I tend to be the person who never realised music has a colour. My music doesn’t lend itself to being identified with one race or culture,” he says. “There’s an Aesop quote: men often applaud the imitation and hiss at the real thing.”</p>
