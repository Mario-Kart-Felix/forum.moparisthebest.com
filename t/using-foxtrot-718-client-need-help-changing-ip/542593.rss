    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/using-foxtrot-718-client-need-help-changing-ip/542593</link>
    <description>i&#39;m pretty new to coding but i do have an issue
my friend is running a Rune eve v3 source and he is port forwarded and everything is working fine.
its just having a friend connect is the issue.

I&#39;ve tried using the foxtrot client and chaining the IP in 
Loader.java then when i compile i get the error

&quot;error_game_invalidhost&quot;

i&#39;ve even tried to just change anything that said &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
and i still get that error.

when i connect locally it shows where my cache is located but then when i change the IP and compile and run it just shows the same error again
IM STUCK can someone help? :(</description>
