    <title>Why are todays people the way they are?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-are-todays-people-the-way-they-are/304396</link>
    <description>ITT: Why are todays people the way they are? I mean the gangsters, the &quot;nerds&quot;, the emos, ect.

I honestly think It&#39;s a lack of parenting. Most of todays peoples parents are 16 year old mothers, that only stay with their &quot;BF&quot; for 6-7 months till ten sum babies pop out of that abused whores vagina.
The people you see today, (Your friends, peers. ect) are probably listening to corrupted music and doing retarded things instead of 
doing something helpful to your community or society. I understand that I&#39;m not helping by addressing a problem we&#39;re all fully aware about, but I don&#39;t think this topic has really been discussed properly. 

Most of the people buying guns and shooting people have corrupt minds, obviously passed down from their parents. 
Like I said, lack of parenting, this also includes neglecting, also sometimes bullying (This case probably doesn&#39;t come up with parents, most likely classmates.) Like I somewhat agree that putting others down sometimes to boost your self-esteem is right SOMETIMES, but I&#39;m not promoting it. I honestly think that all forms of real life bullying and parent neglectment are horrible things. Most of the kids killing themselves are probably hurt by fucking assholes that tease and make fun of them at school, or/and maybe their parents are selfish cock suckers and don&#39;t give a rats ass if they live or die. Sometimes one of these cases may occur, sometimes both. I&#39;m not just saying this because it affects me, because it rarely does. If I see any signs of bullying I tend to try and comfort that person, honestly, I&#39;d suggest you do the same. Even if you don&#39;t give a shit, pretend you do, because that really makes a difference in people&#39;s lives when people care. 

Anyway, I know most of you don&#39;t care. 
But I&#39;m addressing this topic to the people that actually care about todays problems in society.

Discuss your thoughts here, please.</description>

<p>Which can also lead up to the parents. Parents have the right to stop kids from listening to rap and other genres. However, I absolutely love Metal but I am not a psychopath. This might be partly true, but have you forgotten video games as well? Take…Grand Theft Auto for example. You go around killing people, cops, hookers, etc. There have been multiple news articles on reasons people have murdered. Addiction can also lead to this. Remember that kid who shot his dad and mom(I think his mom) and his dad died because they took away his halo game? Perhaps it’s not 100% the parents, but also the kid. They might have the attitude in their genes. It really just depends on your situation.</p>

An kid wants to fit in with their friends, so they become emo.<br>
Gangsters are different a little bit IMO. It’s more because the general judgment of an African American is a gangster, so they feel like they have to be one. Oh, and if you see a white gangster then I guess you’re fucked.<br>
Nerds are just kids that might be smarter, or something like that. Or maybe they wear glasses, which is another stereotype.<br>
For fat kids you can blame TV, Fast Food, and way too much free time, and no use of it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Exactly What i was gonna say but lucky i read the post. Peer preasure is the reason why most kids act kool and wanna be gangsta’s. Or even like me don’t use proper grammer.</p>

I think it would be mostly the parents. A lot of parents don’t spend time with their child, so the child makes stupid decisions. I know a girl who is 14, has had a miscarriage, has a tattoo of a marijuana leaf on her right wrist, and mouths off to every single teacher who asks her to answer a question. It’s a lack of parenting for most children imo.<br>

<p>I’m sure they can, but it’s probably more difficult for them without at least some guidance from their parents.</p>

Peer pressure, you might think “Yeah right, no way fucker!”, but it’s actually the reason.<br>
An kid wants to fit in with their friends, so they become emo.<br>
Gangsters are different a little bit IMO. It’s more because the general judgment of an African American is a gangster, so they feel like they have to be one. Oh, and if you see a white gangster then I guess you’re fucked.<br>
Nerds are just kids that might be smarter, or something like that. Or maybe they wear glasses, which is another stereotype.<br>
For fat kids you can blame TV, Fast Food, and way too much free time, and no use of it.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>There may be reasons to all of those.</p>
<p>Stereotyping</p>
<p>1.Fat kids may eat because they are insecure and are upset how the way they are treated by others, so to fill the gap they eat their sorrows away.</p>
<p>2.Some “Gangsters” have to be “Gangsters” because they have to fight for food, live in the ghetto, do crappy jobs to make it by each day.</p>
<p>3.Peer pressure is a big one, you could get beat up, paddled, murdered if you don’t always follow the ‘rules’ of another person that’s older than you/strongers/tougher etc.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, I was about to say that.<br>
I’m quite fat. I can’t lie.<br>
I do feel insecure and I actually do eat when I feel like i’m not wanted.<br>
I do not eat fast food AT ALL.<br>
I do watch TV.<br>
I do sit in front of my computer all day.<br>
I do ‘hide’ when changing for gym class, because I don’t want to get laughed at when others see my ‘fat’<br>
Fat is something in everyone’s body, though, some people have more, some have less.</p>
<p>The truth is, the inside of a person counts.</p>

<p>My theory is that genetics and a state of mind, people are born with a trigger than could set off for certain events (example parents divorcing). People may inherit their diseases from their parents but they are also enabling themselves in a shitty environment, ultimately resulting in criminality, and ruining society more.<br>
if you tl;dr what i said, individuals can be born with the will to destroy, or they can mimic someone.</p>

<p>Very good response, I agree with you 100%.<br>
And I’m glad you care, atleast some people have the knowledge and common sense to realize what our race has come to.</p>

<p>Im sure many people care about our society but the ratio between people who do and don’t is extremely different. Some people are obviously ruining society with their choices, and all it takes is a no <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> people don’t understand that they can make a huge difference indirectly, or directly.<br>

<p>I agree with you. People think making one wrong choice might not mean something, but look at this:</p>
<p>Parents divorce<br>
Start doing weed<br>
Weed is too under-powered<br>
Start snorting coke<br>
Coke isn’t enough anymore<br>
Start taking meth<br>
You’re 16, get a girl you met yesterday, pregnant<br>
Abandon her and <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">YOUR</span></span> baby<br>
Gain a druggie reputation<br>
Lose all your money on meth pills, $60 EACH<br>
Living on the streets<br>
No family<br>
No family support<br>
No friends<br>
No dignity<br>
Police find you hung in your garage, dead, because you chose to make one bad decison</p>
<p>So remember, making just <span class="bbcode-b">ONE</span> bad decision can lead to a whole life, ruined.<br>
Unfortunately, this is the case for millions of people worldwide, as they don’t understand the consequences of snorting coke at the age of 14.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Anthony La Corte</span>[/quote]</p>
<p>But people don’t realize they can do a number of things.</p>
<p>If you <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">MUST</span></span> have sex, wear a <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">condom</span></span>.</p>
<p>Stop smoking pot.</p>
<p>Don’t even <span class="bbcode-b">try</span> coke.<br>
Don’t <span class="bbcode-b">try</span> meth.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Don’t have sex if you don’t want a girl to get pregnant.</span><br>
If you get her pregnant stay by her.<br>
Don’t <span class="bbcode-b">deal</span> drugs.<br>
Pay attention and be a good kid/teenager so you don’t end up on the street.<br>
Be a good teenager so you hang with the right crowd and friends.<br>
Apologize to your family and make a difference.</p>
<p>There are many errors people can cause, but they can also fix many of them also.</p>
