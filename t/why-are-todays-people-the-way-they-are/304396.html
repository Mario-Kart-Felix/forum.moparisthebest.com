<p>I honestly think It’s a lack of parenting. Most of todays peoples parents are 16 year old mothers, that only stay with their “BF” for 6-7 months till ten sum babies pop out of that abused whores vagina.<br>
The people you see today, (Your friends, peers. ect) are probably listening to corrupted music and doing retarded things instead of<br>
doing something helpful to your community or society. I understand that I’m not helping by addressing a problem we’re all fully aware about, but I don’t think this topic has really been discussed properly.</p>
<p>Most of the people buying guns and shooting people have corrupt minds, obviously passed down from their parents.<br>
Like I said, lack of parenting, this also includes neglecting, also sometimes bullying (This case probably doesn’t come up with parents, most likely classmates.) Like I somewhat agree that putting others down sometimes to boost your self-esteem is right SOMETIMES, but I’m not promoting it. I honestly think that all forms of real life bullying and parent neglectment are horrible things. Most of the kids killing themselves are probably hurt by fucking assholes that tease and make fun of them at school, or/and maybe their parents are selfish cock suckers and don’t give a rats ass if they live or die. Sometimes one of these cases may occur, sometimes both. I’m not just saying this because it affects me, because it rarely does. If I see any signs of bullying I tend to try and comfort that person, honestly, I’d suggest you do the same. Even if you don’t give a shit, pretend you do, because that really makes a difference in people’s lives when people care.</p>
<p>Anyway, I know most of you don’t care.<br>
But I’m addressing this topic to the people that actually care about todays problems in society.</p>
<p>Discuss your thoughts here, please.</p>

        <p>You’re exactly right man.<br>
Moparscape has yet to address this topic in a PROPER manner, yes people have talked about it, but have we tried to change it? No.<br>
Let’s hope everyone in the world thought like you, I know it properly won’t happen, but with the right attitude people will find out this is no joke.<br>
Having a kid at 16?<br>
The father abandoning?<br>
Smoking weed/snorting cocaine/taking meth pills, to relieve pain?<br>
That’s called mental bullshit.<br>
They can think whatever the fack they want, that doesn’t mean it’s doing shit to their body.<br>
By the time they realize that, they are either hooked on meth, or 2 days away from labour.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the parents don’t do shit.<br>
If parenting was like it was 35 years ago, all the kids would be well-behaved, even though they were probably forced to.<br>
Society lives off of each other.<br>
If you look at someone and think that they live alone, with no help from ANYBODY in the world.<br>
Please, <span class="bbcode-b">think again</span>.</p>
<p>That’s all I have on this subject for now, if anyone decides to object against me, I expect a reason why.</p>

<p>Im sure many people care about our society but the ratio between people who do and don’t is extremely different. Some people are obviously ruining society with their choices, and all it takes is a no <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> people don’t understand that they can make a huge difference indirectly, or directly.</p>

<p>So damn true.<br>
People think making one wrong choice might not mean something, but look at this:</p>
<p>Parents divorce<br>
Start doing weed<br>
Weed is too under-powered<br>
Start snorting coke<br>
Coke isn’t enough anymore<br>
Start taking meth<br>
You’re 16, get a girl you met yesterday, pregnant<br>
Abandon her and <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">YOUR</span></span> baby<br>
Gain a druggie reputation<br>
Lose all your money on meth pills, $60 EACH<br>
Living on the streets<br>
No family<br>
No family support<br>
No friends<br>
No dignity<br>
Police find you hanging there, dead, because you chose to make one bad decison</p>
<p>So remember, making just <span class="bbcode-b">ONE</span> bad decision can lead to a whole life, ruined.<br>
Unfortunately, this is the case for millions of people worldwide, as they don’t understand the consequences of snorting coke at the age of 14.</p>

<p>My theory is that genetics and a state of mind, people are born with a trigger than could set off for certain events (example parents divorcing). People may inherit their diseases from their parents but they are also enabling themselves in a shitty environment, ultimately resulting in criminality, and ruining society more.<br>
if you tl;dr what i said, individuals can be born with the will to destroy, or they can mimic someone.</p>

<p>Stop smoking pot.</p>

Pay attention and be a good kid/teenager so you don’t end up on the street.<br>
Be a good teenager so you hang with the right crowd and friends.<br>
Apologize to your family and make a difference.</p>

        <p>That’s very true aswell.<br>
The way i think of it, is that, for every bad thing against my body/someone else etc., I’m losing out on the quality of my future career/projects/anything else with the future. And if they do they follow what you said, they wouldn’t have so much of a strain on their shoulders</p>

<p>Yeah, I was about to say that.<br>
I’m quite fat. I can’t lie.<br>
I do feel insecure and I actually do eat when I feel like i’m not wanted.<br>
I do not eat fast food AT ALL.<br>
I do watch TV.<br>
I do sit in front of my computer all day.<br>
I do ‘hide’ when changing for gym class, because I don’t want to get laughed at when others see my ‘fat’<br>
Fat is something in everyone’s body, though, some people have more, some have less.</p>
<p>The truth is, the inside of a person counts.</p>

<p>I am not going to judge you by your person looks, if your overweight invest some time in a sport or something, football would be excellent, a line man you are on defense and just crush people who get in your way <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> i was overweight until i started playing sports and over the course of 2 years i have bulked up and am 6’3 and have lost a total of 72 pounds.</p>

<p>I’m sure they can, but it’s probably more difficult for them without at least some guidance from their parents.</p>

        <p>I hate to say it but the world was born with violence, its in our blood if we like it or not. But even back to the BC’s cave men were violent people, and thats because they didn’t have anything to do but hunt,breed and possibly sleep. Your greatest ancestor/ancestors began with violence and survival</p>
