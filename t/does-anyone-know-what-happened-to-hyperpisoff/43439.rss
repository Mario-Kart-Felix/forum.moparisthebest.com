    <title>Does Anyone Know What Happened To HyperPisOff?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-know-what-happened-to-hyperpisoff/43439</link>
    <description>I&#39;m just really curious is all. He was co-admin on Autorune I think, and he left before the scam was over. He said he was coming back in a few months, but he never returned to any community, I don&#39;t think. He was always on MSN though.

Does anyone know where he went/what happened to him?

Thanks x</description>

<p>Little-known fact: AutoRune was also a bot.</p>
