    <description>My runserver wont pop up it just pops up and x&#39;s out real fast and my compiler will come up and say javac is not recognized as an internal command or external command, operable program or batch file.  

I used search.  Apperantly others have had the same problem.  However most links are unavailable.  One that was available said theres like a billion tuts on this.  I really dont know.  Sombody please help me.  I have Java(TM) SE Runtime Environmental 6 update 1 as my java... i&#39;m pretty sure thats what the JDK 6.0 is that you guys are talking about.  HELP ME PLEASE I&#39;VE BEEN AT THIS FOR 2 DAYS NOW!!! 2!!!! and gotnowhere

I&#39;m using pimpscape.rar for a source.  I&#39;ll post what i&#39;ve done of The Guardians tut so far- remember all credits go to her.  

Chapter 1: Getting your source
[s]Unless you want to create an entire server from scratch (that will take an experienced coder months), you should get what is called a source. A source is a pre-made server that you can get, and you can edit, and host. Here is a link to some good server downloads:
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,122377.0.html
I suggest you bookmark that page, as you may love some sources, and hate others. Once you get this, you must unzip it with winRAR, which is a common file compression program. Now you have your server folder, but don&#39;t mess around with it yet.[/s]  [color=green]I&#39;ve got pimpscape for my source[/color]

Chapter 2: Getting JDK
[s]Before we can do anything, you must get the Java Development Kit, or JDK. JDK allows you to run your server, and compile it. To get JDK, go to this page:
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
And download JDK 6u1.
Once you&#39;re done installing JDK, we now need to set up your servers IP, which is what the players will use to connect to your server. 
Getting a no-ip
To get an IP, go to www.no-ip.com, and sign up. Once you have signed up, log in. Now on the side, you should see Your No-IP. Under that, is a list of things you can do. On the side, under the Hosts/Redirects section, click Add. It should take you to a page, where you can make a new one. For the Hostname, you create the name you want, and in the scroll box, you pick the rest of the subdomain. Once you have typed your hostname, and selected the other part of it, scroll down, and click Create Host. You now have your No-IP for your server set up.
Note: If you have a router, you need to port-forward. There are several tutorials on this, and I suggest you do them or nobody can connect to your server.[/s]  [color=green]I downloaded Java correctly i think.  I also made a no-ip.  Its just pwnpk.no-ip.org  [/color] 
Chapter 3: Compiling/Running
[s]Now go into your server folder, you should see .java files, and .class files. Locate client.java, and open it with Notepad. This is your main folder for programming the things in your server. The other files are more technical, and you shouldn&#39;t mess with them until you learn java a bit. Now, in your client.java, use ctrl + f, to find the name of the server source you downloaded, and change the name ONLY within the quote marks, otherwise the compiler will tell you about errors. [/s] [color=green]This part I dont understand.  I just search for the word welcome, then find the exact same part of the script and type in pwnpk where pimpscape once was.  Am I correctly doing this?[/color]

[s]Now, save the client.java file[/s], [s]and double-click your compiler[/s]. If your compiler says it cannot find the path specified, [color=green](it didnt- just says &#39;javac&#39; is not recognizable as an internal ec...) [/color] [s]you need to get Mod Taharoks Ultimate Compiler, which can be found here:
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,49747.0.html [/s] [color=green]I opened notepad and made a compiler and saved it- however thats not the compile.bat folder that i have running here.  Their different folders.[/color] 

[s]Now, if it compiled without errors, you can run your server by doubleclicking Runserver.bat, or Run.bat.[/s] [color=green]Mine just x&#39;s out right away[/color]
It will say something like:
&quot;Starting server on 0.0.0.0.43594&quot;
Thats normal, and that means your server is running.

[s]Now, open Moparscape, and type in &quot;localhost&quot; for the IP, and log into your server.[/s] [color=green]I can log into this &quot;localhost&quot; Ip and &quot;0.0.0.0&quot; but idk if this is really my pimpscape working.  it still says hybridscape.[/color]
You now have a working server. You can use tutorials in this section to customize your server.

I sure hope somebody can help me</description>
