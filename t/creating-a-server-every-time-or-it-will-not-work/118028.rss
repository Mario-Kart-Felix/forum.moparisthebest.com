    <title>Creating A Server: EVERY TIME! Or It WILL NOT Work!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-server-every-time-or-it-will-not-work/118028</link>
    <description>Ok, I have Hamachi and everything is fine with that, and I log on and the only way for me to log in is by creating my own server again! So I log in, and my character is fine and logged in and all, but it automatically disconnects me, so I try and log in again, and it says I am already logged in, so I even turn off Ham and it gives me that lol. So then, the only way for me to every go back on it is by recreating the server, so I do that and I log in and guess where I am? I am about to mine in green... This is so messed up, but even with it logged in, every since Ham, it always disconnects me! Please someone help, I already started on new users wear, and mine.

This happened to me on my other PC, execpt I did not have Ham on it

Please help, I am sick of creating it over and over again.</description>
