    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sendframe75-attack-option-in-wildy-help-me-please/192242</link>
    <description>Ok hey guys,

1) Anyone got a list of ids for sendframe75? the ids of the heads?

2) Anyone know what to search to find the thing about the attack option being first or second option depending on your level

3) Anyone know why when u go in wildy, it gives you the attk option but then when u come out of wildy its still there. But when u log in out of wildy you cant see the option. its only when you visit wildy and come out. (ps. it doesnt let you atk, but its annoyin)

----- Thanks for helping :) -----</description>
