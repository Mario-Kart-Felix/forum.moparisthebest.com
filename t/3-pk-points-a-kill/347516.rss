    <description>When people kill people, the &quot;player name&quot; has defeated &quot;player name&quot; appears three times.

I have searched client.java and only found one copy of that snipplet so I know something is calling on it three times. What I&#39;m thinking is that it&#39;s set to appear on death stage two and that I have overlapping zones calling on death stage 2  so instead of firing once, you die three times per kill. 

I just wanna know if this makes sense or if you think it is cause by something else?</description>
