    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-list-of-help-that-i-need-with-creativescape-o/392593</link>
    <description>[size=24pt]  if you can help me with these, list the number then direct me to a tut or post a tut thanks Alot to everyone who helps!    [/size]


[size=12pt]  Most normal tutortials have failed because creativescape is not set up the same as normal servers!   [/size]


[size=12pt] 
1. making follow work properly                  
2. adding rune crossbows with all bolts and adding a darkbow with dragon arrows              
3. when attacking npcs or players you sometimes click attack and you just go and stand next to them, so i want to make it attack on first click        4. changing the client background                   
5. items visable on death. if you die, no one can see your items ever unless they killed you  completed?
6. removing the clicking sound                   
7. removing the 2 hour auto updates                 
8. adding a new quest         

 [/size]

[size=14pt] If i think of anything else i will post a new thread, but i wont attempt anything else till these are all sorted!

I really hate to see people working with PI and Delta, and introducing the newbies into shard is a really good thing to do. I just learn them to fix the bugs so they can actually start working with it.</p>

              <p>Hey<br>
Im here to answer your questions =)<br>
Please note<br>
1.On the original download page is a tut posted on how to remove the click sounds, This would also enable follow I guess.</p>
<p>2.Put your drop model and model into the cache, then use class8.java client sided to add them into the game ids. It is also handy If you would intergrate it 100% with tom’s cache editor but not 100% necassary.<br>
If you don’t know what tom’s cache editor is do a google search. At this very point I was able to put the model in the game, but It doesn’t really react yet. I can’t really help you on that.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Go to constants.java and put the cycle time to 600, this will help alot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also tried to do this, and it works, you will have to host the image urself on a trustable webhost like 000webhost, don’t use tinypic for this!<br>
Enter class30_sub2_sub1_sub1 and replace<br>
this</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>with this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Ok now upload the image and make sure it’s the right dimensions, u need to cut ur image in 2 vertically, and then u will need to turn around the second part of the image.<br>
check this thread to see what I mean else ull get it like this. <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=444084.0" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=444084.0</a><br>
Maybe the getimageurl part aien’t correct 100% Ithink. I will look it up for you in a day or 2 when I can connect to my vps.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>I don’t know that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just commented out the sound player in the client, but again go to the main thread of cs and look at the 9 or 10th page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the most important one, Go into server.java ull see this, server. java is located in the server map: <code>				if(hours == 1 &amp;&amp; minutes == 59 &amp;&amp; secundes == 0){
 				getPlayerManager().updateSeconds = 16;
 				getPlayerManager().updateAnnounced = false;
 				getPlayerManager().updateRunning = true;
 				getPlayerManager().updateStartTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
 			}</code><br>
Change that to whatever time you want to update, I changed it to 10000000000000000 hours because I don’t like auto restarters, in shard bases the amount in shops, drops etc automaticly resets, so it’s not really necassary, If you want to use the restarter though please change amount of time to one minute less than ur restart this will prevent rollbacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will help you later on this one, I already made an easter event, if you wanna check it out search artegoworld on google ull come there. You will have to make different stages for your quest etc do some research in the server Im sure ull find out. I can’t acces the source 2 days because I lost connection  to my vps for 2 days ( It’s not hacked or anything just a wrong option).</p>
</li>
</ol>
