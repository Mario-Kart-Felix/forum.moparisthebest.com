    <description>Hi guys! Well where to start where to start... I played runescape for about 4 years. About 1/20th of that time was on runescape classic. I was quite the advid runescape player, and I really enjoyed the game. After ahwile, my friends started leaveing and well it all went down from their eventually leading up to me getting banned for cussing everyone at the grand exchange out becasue I was going to quit anyway. I played around on a few runescape classic servers for ahwile but never got into any of them. I love runescape classic alot becasue I admire the beginnings of runescape and I love the look, feel, and how it plays. Now I am seriously interested in starting my own runescape classic server in an atempt to recreate runescape classic. I do not want to make a pk server, I want to recreate runescape classic. I am not much of a programmer I have done some work in Perl and that is about it. I do however have a book called &quot;Java in a nutshell&quot; sitting on my shelf that has everything you need to know about java. So guys how do I get started on my adventure?</description>

RSC community is like dead lol<br>
[/quote]<br>
It is? Well I better download everything I can, archive it into a hidden hard-drive. Put it in the closet and wait for 30 years when runescape is dead and all of this is dead.

<p>I suggest you take a source code, and do something basic in it, like changing a formula, or sending a msg to the player. once you get that working. try someting bigger. try adding something to your code that is already on another server source, but that you have to remake. if you’ve done that, try your own stuff.<br>
be sure to “save” your code alot, because you’ll mess up and you’re going to want to restart :P[/quote]That’s actually a bad suggestion. OP should read “java for dummies”, then once fully done reading that, OP should read “java how to program”, THEN move onto programming/editing servers.</p>

              <p>Hi guys! Well where to start where to start… I played runescape for about 4 years. About 1/20th of that time was on runescape classic. I was quite the advid runescape player, and I really enjoyed the game. After ahwile, my friends started leaveing and well it all went down from their eventually leading up to me getting banned for cussing everyone at the grand exchange out becasue I was going to quit anyway. I played around on a few runescape classic servers for ahwile but never got into any of them. I love runescape classic alot becasue I admire the beginnings of runescape and I love the look, feel, and how it plays. Now I am seriously interested in starting my own runescape classic server in an atempt to recreate runescape classic. I do not want to make a pk server, I want to recreate runescape classic. I am not much of a programmer I have done some work in Perl and that is about it. I do however have a book called “Java in a nutshell” sitting on my shelf that has everything you need to know about java. So guys how do I get started on my adventure?</p>
