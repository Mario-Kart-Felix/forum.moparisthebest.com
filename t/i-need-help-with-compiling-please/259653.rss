[size=10pt]HELP PLEASE![/size]
Hey guys I&#39;m having trouble with getting a compiler to work, everytime I try it says &#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as internal or external command, and yes I went through the tuts and I could get my environmental variables to work.  I really need this to work its not letting me compile any of my changes to sources of Runescape Servers.
I first tried setting my paths in the environmental variables.

Then I tried setting my paths in the command prompt. In command prompt I did this.
1) Open Command Prompt
2) I entered: set path-C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin
3) I pressed enter then wrote in: echo %path%
4) I pressed enter then wrote in: javac HelloWorldApp.java
5) Came up with the error again.

If your not that clear with what I did, please look up the video I placed in youtube, I tried to make it as clear as possible.
