    <description>Does anyone else play this gem of a game? I&#39;ve played it multiple times, sometimes even in one sitting. In fact, I long-played it [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4FxdQIqZrc]Here[/url] because I love it so much. There&#39;s also a long-play done by the YouTube user Brickroadbrickroad who upload a 3:15:00 playthrough of it on Christmas and I&#39;ve honestly watched it at least 5 times. The game just never gets old. The usb SNES controller I have also has the game to thank :P

But anyways, what are your guys&#39;s thoughts? Do you like any other Metroid games? Etc etc...
