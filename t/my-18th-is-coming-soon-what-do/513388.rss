    <title>My 18th is coming soon, what do</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-18th-is-coming-soon-what-do/513388</link>
    <description>Well the title says all. My party is on the 6th (sunday is recovery day). Obviously there will be alcohol. I don&#39;t want to hear the crap &quot;Oh you&#39;re just a kid, you shouldn&#39;t be drinking&quot; and all that. I&#39;m going to live my life and do what I do. But what should I do, after. I&#39;m expecting $600 (most I&#39;ll ever get for any celebration). And I know that the &#39;smart&#39; idea would be to get a car. But I&#39;m looking at the alternatives. Maybe a new computer? Etc.
And hey, idea&#39;s for during the party can be cool. Party games. etc.
Go.</description>

<p>What kind of tea party are you planning?</p>
<p>When I had my 18th party I totally over did it, booked a hall, DJ, loads of food and drink and it was the best night ever.<br>
Oh and make sure you get car.</p>

<p>Parties and party games etc are my thing. One of my favourites is tash-on twister (Geordie Shore) you basically get a twister board, spin it, if it lands on someone they must be dared by the person who spun it and must take a shot of tequila (usually from a girls tits). Another good one is get a good beat to a song with 3-5 straight up hard hitting beats, line up 3-5 shots for each person taking a shot and when those beats come into the song you must do one every beat. For example; Bingo Players - Get Up has a line in it which is “birthday shots”, this has 3 syllables and is easily detected in the song, take a shot on the beat of the syllable. Uhh, you could go with the penny game, I have no idea what americans have on their coins but we have the Queen on ours, you throw a coin in your friends drink and tell him to save the queen, he’s got to down the drink then. This is a personal favourite- the ring of sick. get a circle of people, one person takes a drink, the person to their left takes two drinks, the person to their left takes 3 drinks and then it continues until everyone besides one has either given up or been sick. Make sure you have plenty of suicide shots (tequila, salt, lime) and just have good music. I’ve got a lot more games but I just woke up and cba to write them down.</p>

              <p>Parties and party games etc are my thing. One of my favourites is tash-on twister (Geordie Shore) you basically get a twister board, spin it, if it lands on someone they must be dared by the person who spun it and must take a shot of tequila (usually from a girls tits). Another good one is get a good beat to a song with 3-5 straight up hard hitting beats, line up 3-5 shots for each person taking a shot and when those beats come into the song you must do one every beat. For example; Bingo Players - Get Up has a line in it which is “birthday shots”, this has 3 syllables and is easily detected in the song, take a shot on the beat of the syllable. Uhh, you could go with the penny game, I have no idea what americans have on their coins but we have the Queen on ours, you throw a coin in your friends drink and tell him to save the queen, he’s got to down the drink then. This is a personal favourite- the ring of sick. get a circle of people, one person takes a drink, the person to their left takes two drinks, the person to their left takes 3 drinks and then it continues until everyone besides one has either given up or been sick. Make sure you have plenty of suicide shots (tequila, salt, lime) and just have good music. I’ve got a lot more games but I just woke up and cba to write them down.</p>
