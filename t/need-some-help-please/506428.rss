    <description>Hi, My Primal maul in my hand looks like im carrying a normal weapon, not like a normal maul..
my scimitars and like ls are pointed up.. which looks stupid.. also I&#39;ve looked in item.java but its small.. cant see anything..
Also if auto retaliate is on, if your not next to the npc you wont retaliate, also.. when someone trades, you hav to right click them and trade them, you cant click the request on the chat box.
Also my spec on gmaul doesnt work on npcs and the Running in my serv seems slow and long strides.. want a normal run.
If someone could add my Skype and maybe show me somethings? or guide me please?
