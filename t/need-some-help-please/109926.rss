    <description>Hey. I am new to coding and such so i need a little help to fix some problems im having with starterscape. These are the problems...
-Money on ground looks like a big pile but is only 1 coin.
-when you sell things you only get 1 coin
-when you spawn items you only get 1 of them(no matter how many you put in the code)

If someone can help me with these that would be great:) thanks[br][size=1]Posted on: June 12, 2007, 03:08:02 PM[/size][hr]comeon. Need some help here:P</description>

              <p>to get more than one item, u need to put in <span class="bbcode-b">noted</span> id and then how much u want<br>
except for when it’s stackable<br>
then u use same id</p>
<p>the 1 coin thing is prolly a glitch in ur server, i’m sure some servers are like that</p>
<p>selling things - depends on what u sell, depends on what ur selling<br>
go into item.cfg and find the item<br>
change the first 3 items(low alch store sell and high alch prices i think)<br>
but DON’T just change them<br>
they gotta be divided by certain number that i dunno</p>
