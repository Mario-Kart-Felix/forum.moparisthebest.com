    <description>Ok I&#39;m using PwnScapes source and I have skills not working, and I was wondering how do I make simple methods for skills that gain fast XP for Herblore, Runecrating, Fletching, Smithing, Mining, Fishing, and Farming, I need to know how to write the code/method for it, I&#39;m MEGA confused :s

Also whenever you buy a Fire cape and if you log out it dissappears and I need to know how to fix that :s

Add me on my MSN at: pure69m0nk@hotmail.com

Thanks!
