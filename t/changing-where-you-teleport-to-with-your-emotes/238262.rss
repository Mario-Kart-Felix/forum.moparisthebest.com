    <description>hello, i&#39;ve got a small problem here.
how come, when i change the X and Y where i tele with the command, the same tele in emote tab doesnt work anymore. i thought it should just tele you to the old place, or tele you to where you set the command to.

anybody knows how i can change these tele&#39;s the right way? :\

thanks :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 22, 2008, 07:04:42 am[/size][hr]when i change the teleportoX and teleportoY of the command teampk, the tele in my emotes tab doesnt work anymore..
