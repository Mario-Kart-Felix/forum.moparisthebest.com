    <title>MugorPkz Coming Soon!;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mugorpkz-coming-soon/350694</link>
    <description>Dear Members,

I am currently the consuming question of creating a private server just for you guys named &#39;MugorPkz&#39; This server will be as you probly all already well aware a &#39;Pking&#39; server. Over the past time i hopefully will or i want to add some skills. So then both pking and skilling are in the same server!

I have had quite a bit of experiance of the past but this is where my experiance will let me down. I do not have experiance as running a server only have experiance Moderating and Administrating Servers/Forums.
I hoping to make the Forums as good as the Server well the Website more like.

As this is all a question this question is stuck at the top of my rusty old brain and not coming out. Whilst im thinking about this, i&#39;m looking for MATURE staff that can lead this server all the way. The main part of the staff im looking for is a CODER. If you are a coder and you would like to help me out and become my partner then please get in contact soon or reply to this thread.

I am 15 i am soon graduating school and i also am british!

Here are the positions of the server so far:

Owner- Mugor(Me)
Co-Owner/Coder- Yet To Be Hired

Administrator- Yet To Be Hired

Moderator- Yet To Be Hired
Moderator- Yet To Be Hired

Just because theres only that amount of positions there doesn&#39;t mean we can only hire that many it just because we only need that many at the moment.

Please just back soon for more updates etc Pictures etc.

Thank You.

Sincerly Mugor.</description>
