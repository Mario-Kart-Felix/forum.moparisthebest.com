    <title>Need help with using npsdrops.cfg to make..npcdrops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-using-npsdrops-cfg-to-make-npcdrops/164866</link>
    <description>i&#39;ve seen so many tutorials on this. none of them bloody helped, i made a tztok-jad, and then i went into npcdrops.cfg, made this:
npcdrop = 2745		5		6570	1
that, shoudl have made it drop a firecape.
now, i looked at the dtrops for man, and figured this out:
drop type /item
1. coins [coins]
2. iron dagger, bronze arrow, bolts [weapons]
3. bronze med helm, iron med helm [armour]
4. earth rune, law rune, fire rune, blood rune, chaos rune, mind rune [runes]
5. herb, leather boots, fishing bait, [other]

therefore, theoretically, drop type 5 for firecape should be correct, and yet all i seem to get for the drop it dwarf remains (wtf?) and bones.


[i&#39;m using hybridscape as a base here, therefore no java files.]
[when i play hybridscape, i&#39;ve noticed no monsters drop anything other than dwarf remains]

help greatly appreciated.</description>
