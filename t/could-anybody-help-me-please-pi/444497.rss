    <description>hi im using a PI source. 

im trying to fix the trade problem.
the problem is if i trade somebody it comes up on there screen **** wants to trade with you . then they accept it and then it comes up on my screen saying they wish to trade with me.

its a constant loop and we never get to the trade screen...

i have looked in the  tutorial sections and havnt found this problem.

any1 know the answer.
