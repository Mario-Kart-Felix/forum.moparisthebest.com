    <title>Can someone do me a favour?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-do-me-a-favour/3917</link>
    <description>Hey,

Can someone buy me a domain from 1and1?

I&#39;ll pay you back immediatly through a bank transfer(can take up to 8 days however), it&#39;s just that every domain registrant I can find requires you to have a Credit card or a verified paypal. I have my account all set up on 1and1 which I can give you a password for and all you need to do is enter your credit card to buy the domain, and I will send you 10 dollars(even though the domain is only like 6 dollars). 

PM me if your willing to help, thanks.</description>
