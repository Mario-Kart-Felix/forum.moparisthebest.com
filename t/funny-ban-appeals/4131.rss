    <description>I did a search on this and nothign came up, sorry if this thread has been repeated somewhere... if it was then delete the thread  :|

Anyways, I remember seeing a thread like this on Kaitnieks, just post your ban appeals that you did for fun, just to see their response. Of course now all (or most) of their responses are automated. Post away  ;D</description>

              <p>I remember when my brother’s account was banned a couple of months ago for cussing out a level 5 player moderator and his friend. He quit for a while, so I decided to have fun with the appeal. I wrote something like:</p>
<p>Dear Jagex,</p>
<pre><code>.,!,,(~.~),,!,.
</code></pre>
<p>Yours Truly,<br>
Ekthador</p>
<p>Level 126, top 200 in high scores… haha, he was pissed.</p>

              <p>I did a search on this and nothign came up, sorry if this thread has been repeated somewhere… if it was then delete the thread  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>Anyways, I remember seeing a thread like this on Kaitnieks, just post your ban appeals that you did for fun, just to see their response. Of course now all (or most) of their responses are automated. Post away  ;D</p>
