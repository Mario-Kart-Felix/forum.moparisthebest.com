    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/activision-releases-its-biggest-black-ops-2-patch/508272</link>
    <description>Well, I just got a 42MB update when going to play black ops.. Apparently, it was to be sent out March 12th, but I barley got it today.
[quote=&quot;Activision&quot;]Feature Improvements

Hosts can now kick players in Custom Game lobbies.
Hint text for the Camera toggle in the Live Stream menu updated to include support for the XBOX 360 Kinect sensor.

The CODcast UI is now displaying the flag for the Flag Carrier in the Objective column.

Resolved a couple of overlapping UI issues when CODcasting.
Players can now turn the Voice Icon On/Off when CODcasting a match in Theater.
 
Gameplay Balancing
 
Spawn System Improvements:
Reduced the weight of positive team spawn influencers on owned Domination flags. This reduces cases in Domination where players may spawn near their team but also near danger.
Added more spawn points to Hijacked for Demolition and Kill Confirmed, which improves the spawn-picking algorithm on that map in those game modes.
Adjusted spawn influencers on Standoff for improved spawn-picking algorithms in all game modes.
 
SMGs:
MSMC: Recoil has been increased.
MSMC: Hip fire accuracy has been slightly reduced.
PDW57: Recoil has been increased.
PDW57: Hip fire accuracy has been slightly reduced.
 
Pistols:
KAP-40: Dual wield damage reduced.
KAP-40: Dual wield hip fire accuracy has been reduced.
 
 
Attachments:
MMS: Cold blooded now renders enemies almost completely invisible to MMS.
 
LMGs:
QBB-LSW: Medium range damage increased.
HAMR: Medium range damage increased.
 
Assault Rifles:
FAL OSW + Select Fire: Damage reduced when firing full auto.
SMR + Select Fire: Damage reduced when firing full auto.
Type 25: Move speed increased.
Type 25: Medium range damage increased.
SCAR: Long range damage increased.
SWAT-556: Long range damage increased.

Shotguns:
M1216: Medium range damage increased.
 
Sniper Rifles:
Ballista + Iron Sight: Idle sway reduced.
 
 
Zombies Issues Addressed
Resolved several issues with exploitable areas in the Die Rise
Resolved several exploits in Green Run
Resolved network/connectivity issues that could occur in the frontend and lobbies.[/quote]

Well, a lot of these I never heard of. But I&#39;m glad it&#39;s all patched. I think the funniest one is this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved an issue where planting a Claymore in front of a crouched player with a Riot Shield would cause the Claymore to fly across the map.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
How the hell do you even manage to find that out.

The knifing is completely horrible, it’s like the person is invisible infront of you; you nearly always miss.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>rofl, thats far better then knifing across the map (reference to most other call of duties, especially mw2)[/quote]<br>
The reason, in case you didn’t know, for the knife being so crappy in this game is because in the first black ops, a bug was found where you could <span class="bbcode-i">literally</span> knife across the map. So they deleted the code for the knife, and started from scratch.</p>

That’s how they always did it for Black Ops 1 zombies.</p>

How the hell do you even manage to find that out.
