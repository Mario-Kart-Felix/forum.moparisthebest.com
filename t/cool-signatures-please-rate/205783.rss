<p>If you only want to post them for positive feedback (because it’s what it looks like), then the only feedback you want is your own.</p>
<p>IMO, the best one is the third one. Though like others have said, <span class="bbcode-b">the text is hardly readable</span>. I can take a guess and say it says “XOSTAT’S GRAPHICS”, but c’mon… White on white?</p>

<p>I agree people here are very self obsessed. But some of the newer Graphic designers (If you can call them that.) are proud of their work. They’re new to it, so they don’t totally understand what real art looks like. But in time they do mature. I’m sure you started some where, did you not?</p>
<p>I’m not saying you aren’t right Brownsymcard. But I find it very cocky of you to call me kid. You don’t know anything about me. You try and judge me by my posts. But that isn’t me, as of late I have not put very much effort into giving people here C&amp;C, mainly because everything that is posted has been just awful. I admit the shit posted on this board doesn’t look like art, but sometimes, and this happens very rarely, we get someone who does post some decent work. That has depth, and portrays something deeper than just brushing.</p>
<p>I can use brushes, and make something beautiful, is painting not just using brushes but in specific ways to get a desired effect? I have made my own brushes, and I use them often. So are they not original?</p>
<p>I can’t post any work from here that is made from scratch. Except yours, and some others. But it’s not worth going and finding them.</p>
<p>I do look past visuals, I do have a deeper understanding of images, I just choose to not waste my energy on critiquing an image here properly. They don’t learn, or take my C&amp;C to heart. If my C&amp;C were respected, I would actually C&amp;C it to my best. I used to do that. You can even go back and look at some of my older C&amp;C, and you’ll see the way I am now isn’t how I am.</p>
<p>I think we both agree on a lot of things, but it’s on a personal level I’ve been angry at you. Not how you act towards the graphics section. So I would like to apologize.[/quote]</p>
<p>I saw we drop all personal things. There are some great coders in the web design section. However, you must admit, there are far too many posts of people taking templates and calling it their website. (Not nearly as bad as it used to be since they’ve put up those stickys.</p>
<p>Sorry for calling you kid, its just a habit from xbox live where 10 yr olds will try to cuss you out for beating them.</p>

              <p>True that brownsymcard.  Without meaningfulness, the pictures are not art.  I said that in another post: “Don’t sig’s have to make sense…?”.  They never do.  I mean, there are some signatures that can be realised as something that makes sense, but that’s only 1 person’s perspective of the picture (Example: spiderman’s in a signature, and there’re red and orange brush marks to his left.  This could be perceived as an explosion, but probably wasn’t made with intent to create that affect to the end user).</p>

<p>You certainly aren’t wanted here. Just because you make hideous images from scratch doesn’t mean they’re good. It just means you made an ugly ass picture from a white canvas. I could draw a bunch of lines coordinating with gradients and circles. And I’d probably get praise for it too.</p>
<p>But see, you’ve got a problem. You have this whole cocky attitude when you post here. But you have nothing to back it up. When you first posted your art here, you were so proud of it. But I thought it wasn’t good in the least. You don’t impress me at all.</p>
<p>Get over yourself, you are not special at all. You have no gift. Find something you might be decent at. Graphics definitely isn’t one of them.[/quote]</p>
<p>I post maybe 1 out of every 20 things I make on this forum. I have never once been cocky in a post with any thing i made (please quote something). Nearly everything ive posted here has been 20 minute boredom work. If the whole cocky thing comes from reading my sig, I have my sig how it is because there is rarely any original work on this forum. In the web section its always “Look at my website!!! ITS Aw3s0m3!!!”, when its someone with a paragraph of text and a premade template. When the same people try to judge the work of others.</p>
<p>Most sigs people post here, is ALWAYS with a complete self obsessive attitude. “Cool Signatures Please Rate”; someone gives their opinion, then they get “FUCK YOU, YOU KNOW NOTHING!!!”.</p>
<p>Please, show me one single solitary sig on this forum that someone made in PS, without A: Using downloaded brushes, or B: Without using a ripped render?</p>
<p>Please, post some of your images with proof that it is yours, and I will post something I value for once. I fail to see how I have been cocky when posting a topic called “-Piece Title-” with the contents of the topic linking to it, and then asking for constructive criticism.</p>
<p>Also, learn to look past visuals kid, you would call a piece like “White on White” crap, showing you have no concept capabilities.</p>
<p>My problem with this community is that people have no concept of art. Yes its a graphics section, so it doesn’t need to be art. Everyone, go ahead post your sigs, lots of them look quite nice, but stop calling your sigs art. Art is not based off of something looking good. Go ahead, post your web banner, ask for suggestions, but don’t call it art. If it has a purpose (sigs, banners, c4d eggs, etc) but does not convey any meaning, it is not art.</p>
