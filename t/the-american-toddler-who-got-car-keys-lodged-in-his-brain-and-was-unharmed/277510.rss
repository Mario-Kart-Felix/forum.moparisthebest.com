    <title>&quot;The American toddler who got car keys lodged in his brain...&quot; And was unharmed?</title>

    <description>Sup guys. I heard about this after watching a video on it, from a YouTuber  (FLuffee Talks). Although it&#39;s old, it&#39;s pretty amazing. Honestly, it&#39;s pretty hard to say why he was unharmed. I wanted to hear your opinions on it.

News link: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1089309/Pictured-The-American-toddler-got-set-car-keys-lodged-brain---recovered-unscathed.html

Again, I didn&#39;t find this myself.

              <p>Sup guys. I heard about this after watching a video on it, from a YouTuber  (FLuffee Talks). Although it’s old, it’s pretty amazing. Honestly, it’s pretty hard to say why he was unharmed. I wanted to hear your opinions on it.</p>
<p>News link: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1089309/Pictured-The-American-toddler-got-set-car-keys-lodged-brain---recovered-unscathed.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1089309/Pictured-The-American-toddler-got-set-car-keys-lodged-brain---recovered-unscathed.html</a></p>
