    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cheescape-based-317-help-with-shop-config/362696</link>
    <description>3rd time posting this btw doesnt anyone know?

basically, my shops with absolutely not let you sell any items. even the items that you buy from the shop. furthermore i think this is caused by a flaw in the money system on my server. atm the only way to get money is to spawn it in the character files. when you do so you can use that money like it is normal. but when you bank that money and try and get it out again. it comes in increments of 1. for both of these i think it is a major flaw in the base.

2. to fix the money problem someone could show me how to create an ingame command that admins can use to spawn money such as ::money amount  or mabye i could just use pickup.</description>
