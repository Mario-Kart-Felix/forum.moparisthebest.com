    <description>Hey everyone. I`m actually wanting to add some things to my server which are:

I wanted to add spells such as Energy transfer, heal other, heal group and veng other ( basically just these ) but i don`t even know how to start coding that. :confused:

Add ::1hp command and ::killme or ::die commands. :rolleyes:

::demote which i tried to make following a guide at youtube but DIDN`T work. :(

and last one ::alltome which isn`t working too. :(


I know you all might say ``wow you wan`t too much ...´´ but actually that`s all i need to do so i can get my server the way i wan`t. Anything is accepted, any little help, ANYTHING is really really REALLY apreciated. :D

Thanks, Br.</description>
