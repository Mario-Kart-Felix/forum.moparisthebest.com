    <title>Would you want to work for Jagex?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-you-want-to-work-for-jagex/8275</link>
    <description>I was just wondering because I have too much spare time and decided I wanted to see how many of you want to work for them.
I would like to work for them, tbh I don&#39;t see why half the people even take the piss out of them sometimes, they&#39;re a great company who made a great game and if they hadn&#39;t made it, we wouldn&#39;t even be here.

I honestly would if I got the chance (which I wont).
Reasons:

[ul][li]I&#39;d be doing something I love and am good at[/li]
[li]I only learnt programming from my enthusiasm at cheating[/li]
[li]I&#39;d learn more and get even better at java[/li][/ul]


I hope none of you spam or flame because that really would make me think of you a lot less.</description>

no, because of the following points:</p>
<ol>
<li>no way in hell I would be caught living in the UK <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">

<li>mechanical engineering ftw ;D<br>

I’ve lived in the UK my whole life and I &lt;3 it (apart from the nothingness that is clacton)<br>
Programming for  living would be like a dream come true, I’m good at it, so why not make money from it?<br>
Mechanical engineering doesn’t sound that bad and you’re obviously entitled to your own opinion but I would prefer programming tbh.</li>

Who wants to code for a living? Pretty boring imo.<br>
[/quote]Um…thats going to be why i am going to college…<img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> dunno if yu have noticed how much money they make for this, take the members of rs, and times that by 5, they make a lot…[/quote]</p>
<p>And advertisement.</p>
<p>Theres alot of money in programming. Jagex offers 40k a year i believe if your a java or C programmer. That is alot of money, just over Â£750 a week. Then if your say american and go work there, you make money of the conversion rates. In fact where ever you live you will make money of the conversion unless you live in the uk =P.</p>
<p>Also it depends what motivates you whether you would liek to work there. Whether you need to constantly use your brain or if you need to be active and running around.</p>
<p>I could probaly work for jagex for a few years but after that i’d probaly leave and get another job. I need things changing, keeps life intresting.</p>
