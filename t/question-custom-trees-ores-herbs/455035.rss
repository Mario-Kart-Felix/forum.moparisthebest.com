    <title>[Question] Custom trees, ores, herbs?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-custom-trees-ores-herbs/455035</link>
    <description>I was wondering is there any way someone can import custom models of a tree herbs and ores? Like recolor ores and put them at a certain place on the map? How would i go about that. Also when you mine the ore it gives a certian item?</description>
