    <title>[NSFW] The Deep Web</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nsfw-the-deep-web/423569</link>
    <description>Why NSFW? If your boss knows about this subject and sees u reading about it, u prob can start packing your shit and search a new job.
Much bishops, politicians and other powerful people are on the deep web.

[b]I don&#39;t think this is against the rules.
And I think it&#39;s better to provide people some basic information,
instead of they start searching for it themselves and get in troubles.
If there still should be a problem mods, 
then please lock and let me know why.
thanks[/b]

[i]I just read the topic about the deep web, I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s closed.
But it&#39;s not a troll like some one said.
I have used it for years,
but it&#39;s a really dark place.
If u are of young age or you can&#39;t handle much scary stuff then I recommend to simply not search for it.
I just wanted to post this and not make a topic of it but since it&#39;s closed I had to cuz I want to share this message :p
If u want information about it u can PM me, [/i]

Generally the deep web is the part of the web that can not be accessed via the surface web where we are on now.
There are different layers of internet users. Lemee show you;

[b]The first layer[/b] is where the most internet users are, like the most people you will know,
these people only care about facebook and youtube.

People who are member of a forums like here I already classify in [b]the 2nd layer[/b], because on forums you see much information, like this topic.
That a surface user never knows the existence of, just like most people will certainly know 4chan.

[b]The 3d layer[/b] will much people here know to, piratebay, torrents ect.. Free downloading, also basic hacking like sql injection is in this layer, 
basically in this layer you are already an illegal internet user, but no panic, as long u are not a spreader u are safe.

[b]3B layer[/b] is [b]not[/b] on the picture
this is the shallow web.
These are very old websites or criminal websites that are not indexed by search engines but it&#39;s still a part of the surface web.
U only can find them by knowing the right people who can provide u with the links.

[b]4th layer[/b] is the deep web, 
this part can not be accessed by a user of the above layers, 
Everyone is anonymous here and there is no influence by the corrupt commercial world, like as example u will never see an advert,
there are also no search browsers, If u google in one of the above 3 layers u will sometimes see sites who offer a browser to search the deep web, this is not true, they can&#39;t.
You need a special browser, the best one like said in the other topic is the TOR-browser,

[b]Short/ how it works:[/b]
U try to access a website through the TOR-browser, the TOR network send the data through hundreds of TOR servers, everyone who uses the TOR browser is a part of the network, it dumps your data in form of cookies on all the computers the data has been send through. This makes it almost impossible to be tracked. Also a TOR browser already provides an extra proxy. You basically can&#39;t be found when using TOR. 
Also like the shallow web u need to be provided by links from people to surf on the deep web.

There is a database with links called the hidden wiki, but it&#39;s much down because everyone who wants can post there links, so there is also a lot of cp on it. Anonymous is regularly ddosing the website for that. It ruined the deep web, since pedophiles found there new home there.
Else the deep web provides you with tuns of forums about every subject that exists, also things u never knew that it did exist.
Cool interesting and handy stuff but also really scary stuff where I will not write about since there are still children on this forum.
Like said u can pm me for more information.

[b]About the last layer I will also not provide information for the same reason from above.[/b]

I hope this cleared up some things for you and that my fingers don&#39;t hurt for nothing :p

Yeah I thought 5,000 times larger than the “surface web” seemed a bit over exaggerated, but still. Who knows?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Estimates based on extrapolations from a study done at University of California, Berkeley in the year 2000, speculate that the deep Web consists of about 91,000 terabytes. By contrast, the surface Web (which is easily reached by search engines) is about 167 terabytes[dubious – discuss]; the Library of Congress, in 1997, was estimated to have 3,000 terabytes.[4] More accurate estimates are available for the number of resources in the deep Web: He et al. detected around 300,000 deep web sites in the entire Web in 2004,[5] and, according to Shestakov, around 14,000 deep web sites existed in the Russian part of the Web in 2006.[6][/quote]I don’t like to be a hyprocrite so I’m going to say this: he and wikipedia might be right.</p>
<p>It says: “a study done at University of California, Berkeley in the year 2000”:</p>
<p>167 terabytes might be quite relative for the year 2000. Back then the Internet was just getting popular. But it was not as popular as it is today. There was no youtube,facebook,…</p>
<p>There were no sites that handled millions of images and video’s per day.</p>

<p>Estimates based on extrapolations from a study done at University of California, Berkeley in the year 2000, speculate that the deep Web consists of about 91,000 terabytes. By contrast, the surface Web (which is easily reached by search engines) is about 167 terabytes[dubious – discuss]; the Library of Congress, in 1997, was estimated to have 3,000 terabytes.[4] More accurate estimates are available for the number of resources in the deep Web: He et al. detected around 300,000 deep web sites in the entire Web in 2004,[5] and, according to Shestakov, around 14,000 deep web sites existed in the Russian part of the Web in 2006.[6]</p>

The deep web is merely any unindexed content on the internet which is quite obviously going to be a large amount of it. I don’t think it’s even that scary, it’s just like a black market but over the internet. Technically you could have a page and put it behind a login screen and that would be “deep”.[/quote]That’s what I’m trying to say, also, I don’t believe that the “deep web” is much larger than the normal web. I’d bet it’s at least 1000 times smaller.</p>
