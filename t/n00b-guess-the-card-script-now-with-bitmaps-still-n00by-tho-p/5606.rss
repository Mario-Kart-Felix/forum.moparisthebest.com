    <description>n00bish script ever  ;D but i just made it in about 30 seconds to play guess the card, since it has a change of &quot;increasing your pet&#39;s mental prowess&quot; so, for all the idiots, that means &quot;Make smarter&quot; ;)
feel free to edit the waits to make it fit your internet speed 

EDIT:  i am learning about bitmaps right now, so expect a script that can do it with randoms not messing it up :P
and yaay 1 download :D lol

EDIT AGAIN: yaay first bitmap script i ever wrote done :P
tell me if its any good, its a simple script so it should run without bugs, and it can now click the right place even if you get a random, so its good to let it run for as long as u got money to play :P which should last HOURS UPON HOURS if you just had 1K to start with :P
all it does it click the top of the wavy line, then clicks the P in play again, simple enough :P
noob proof ;D well here it is 
NOTE: either run it in full screen or 1280x960 because the script doesnt scroll down...... just a helpfull tip ;D

EDIT THREE:  I updated it once more, it runs better and it stops when it detects that you have 0 np..... and yes, you can have 0&#39;s in your np because the bitmap searches for a NP: 0 pic, and not just a 0 pic in the top right corner :P once in a while it may click a couple extra times after you run out of np, but it wont do anything, it just clicks emptyness, and it stops within a couple clicks, it seems to be random with me, sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesnt.



It&#39;s still a n00b script tho ;D
i&#39;m gonna let this run overnight on a newb account, see if its detectable for running long times (they might get suspicious if its ran for 7+ hours, just a test)

How To Run:  Drag Crosshairs over your browser window while at the screen where you pick cards, with scren resolution at 1024x(whatever goes here) or higher, with full screen browser and just hit run and sit back.  edit waits for whatever speed you have.......</description>

              <p>Simple yet effective. Maybe you could get a better bitmap of the 0 neopoints bitmap but otherwise nice. O and also i had to modify the x and y of the mouse after the bitmap. So like</p>
<p>x:=x+10<br>
y:=y+3</p>
<p>after the findbitmap for play again. Just to make it click in the middle instead of the top left corner. You could make it heaps faster by making a repeat inbetween clicks to wait for the next page to load. I could do it for you but where would the fun be in that</p>
