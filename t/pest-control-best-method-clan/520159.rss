    <title>Pest Control [Best Method/ Clan]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pest-control-best-method-clan/520159</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I started my void pure awhile back and I wanted to share some information that might help you all on your way to void. That being the best world&#39;s etc... Jagex released that the &quot;Pest Control&quot; world is 344, this is not true. If you want to get fast PC Points, you need to join the clan &quot;iemz&quot;. Iemz is a 24-7 Pest Control clan that is nearly full all of the time with 5-6 boats running and about 1-3 minute games. Iemz world hops quite a bit to leave bots behind (That being about every 30-45 minutes) You can constantly play pest control with this clan (no waiting in boat because it fills up past 25 players within seconds), with super fast game completion, and super fast void/exp! Just a heads up since it has helped me greatly! :D</description>
