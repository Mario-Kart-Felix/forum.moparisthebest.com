    <title>Fixing lines in transparent models (method converted from 508)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixing-lines-in-transparent-models-method-converted-from-508/394652</link>
    <description>[b]I know i am not the first to do this, but i have done this all on my own. This method was converted from the 508 client.[/b]

What this method does is fix the lines that show up in transparent models on the 317 client.

I wont show you where to put this method so youll have to figure that out yourself.

[code]
	public static void method375(int[] ai, int i, int l, int i1, int j1, int k1) {
		int j;
		int k;
		int l1 = 0;
		if (aBoolean1462) {
			if (i1 &gt; DrawingArea.centerX)
				i1 = DrawingArea.centerX;
			if (l &lt; 0) {
				j1 -= l * l1;
				l = 0;
			}
		}
		if (l &lt; i1) {
			i += l;
			j1 += l1 * l;
			if (aBoolean1464) {
				k = i1 - l &gt;&gt; 2;
				if (k &gt; 0)
					l1 = (k1 - j1) * anIntArray1468[k] &gt;&gt; 15;
				else
					l1 = 0;
				if (anInt1465 == 0) {
					if (k &gt; 0) {
						do {
							j = anIntArray1482[j1 &gt;&gt; 8];
							j1 += l1;
							ai[i++] = j;
							ai[i++] = j;
							ai[i++] = j;
							ai[i++] = j;
						} while (--k &gt; 0);
					}
					k = i1 - l &amp; 0x3;
					if (k &gt; 0) {
						j = anIntArray1482[j1 &gt;&gt; 8];
						do
							ai[i++] = j;
						while (--k &gt; 0);
					}
				} else {
					int j2 = anInt1465;
					int l2 = 256 - anInt1465;
					if (k &gt; 0) {
						do {
							j = anIntArray1482[j1 &gt;&gt; 8];
							j1 += l1;
							j = (((j &amp; 0xff00ff) * l2 &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00ff) + ((j &amp; 0xff00)
									* l2 &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00));
							int h = ai[i];
							ai[i++] = (j
									+ ((h &amp; 0xff00ff) * j2 &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00ff) + ((h &amp; 0xff00)
									* j2 &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00));
							h = ai[i];
							ai[i++] = (j

							h = ai[i];
							ai[i++] = (j

							h = ai[i];
							ai[i++] = (j
									+ ((h &amp; 0xff00ff) * j2 &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00ff) + ((h &amp; 0xff00)
									* j2 &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00));
						} while (--k &gt; 0);
					}
					k = i1 - l &amp; 0x3;
					if (k &gt; 0) {
						j = anIntArray1482[j1 &gt;&gt; 8];
						j = (((j &amp; 0xff00ff) * l2 &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00ff) + ((j &amp; 0xff00)
								* l2 &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00));
						do {

									+ ((i_61_ &amp; 0xff00ff) * j2 &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00ff) + ((i_61_ &amp; 0xff00)
									* j2 &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00));
						} while (--k &gt; 0);
					}
				}
			} else {
				int i2 = (k1 - j1) / (i1 - l);
				k = i1 - l;
				if (anInt1465 == 0) {
					do {
						ai[i++] = anIntArray1482[j1 &gt;&gt; 8];
						j1 += i2;
					} while (--k &gt; 0);
				} else {
					int i_62_ = anInt1465;
					int i_63_ = 256 - anInt1465;
					do {
						j = anIntArray1482[j1 &gt;&gt; 8];
						j1 += i2;
						j = (((j &amp; 0xff00ff) * i_63_ &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00ff) + ((j &amp; 0xff00)
								* i_63_ &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00));
						int i_64_ = ai[i];
						ai[i++] = (j
								+ ((i_64_ &amp; 0xff00ff) * i_62_ &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00ff) + ((i_64_ &amp; 0xff00)
								* i_62_ &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff00));
					} while (--k &gt; 0);
				}
			}
		}
	}
[/code]

Enjoy!

your result should be this:

<p>Thanks, I was just about to post this. However, one of my friends actually edited the 317 client to load the new cache format (for some parts of the cache), such as items, models, and textures. He has 100% 646 textures xD. Also, what was the problem with this code before? (Sorry I don’t really mess with the 317 protocols)…</p>

<p>youre talking about flammable i presume? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Ever figure out why he was banned from rune server?</p>
<p>There really wasnt a problem with the code from 317, it could be tweaked to get the same result, except with this one it makes your inventory items look more like 508 (317 had items a little darker), and the transparent models on 317 you could see the lines in them that connected the faces and it made the models look ugly.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes i am talking about flamable, he taught me most of my java, and then i just got better at it lol.<br>
he got banned on r-s for ddosing it with 900 nodes on his botnet[/quote]</p>
<p>lol holy shit, did someone piss him off or something?</p>
<p><span class="mention">@coon</span>, even then, not all 600+ data is in the client, what’s missing is flo, interfaces, and other things that go along with it.<br>
But yea people are quick to get items, npcs, objects nowadays</p>

<p>Thanks, I was just about to post this. However, one of my friends actually edited the 317 client to load the new cache format (for some parts of the cache), such as items, models, and textures. He has 100% 646 textures xD. Also, what was the problem with this code before? (Sorry I don’t really mess with the 317 protocols)…<br>

<p>There really wasnt a problem with the code from 317, it could be tweaked to get the same result, except with this one it makes your inventory items look more like 508 (317 had items a little darker), and the transparent models on 317 you could see the lines in them that connected the faces and it made the models look ugly.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes i am talking about flamable, he taught me most of my java, and then i just got better at it lol.<br>
he got banned on r-s for ddosing it with 900 nodes on his botnet</p>

Sorry I took the impression of the raw 600+ cache itself, and yes I know it would require a complete re-write in the 317 client to do this. Perhaps to just introduce the 317 protocal into the 600+ client being easier. What I mean is, what is done on many clients, all of the 600+ data packed into the 317 cache, replacing all 317 data. Sorry for the false impression.</p>

<p>the offset of the pixels was called in the wrong place. although in 508 they still didn’t fix it entirely, they made a dummy variable thats the same as the offset before the increment. they also tweaked the brightness by a bit.</p>
