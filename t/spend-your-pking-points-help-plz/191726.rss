    <title>Spend your pking points..help plz?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/spend-your-pking-points-help-plz/191726</link>
    <description>Ok, so i got pking points working, right so now what i want is so that they can choose the skill they want and spend points on the skill...

i know how to do it lol..like..

[code]
if (killcount &gt;= 10) {
killcount -= 10;
addSkillXP(skillid, 250);
}
[/code]

Ok but anyway...i need an interface or something which could show the skill name...and so you could click the skill name and spend the points...

or would it be easyer to make it so you click an npc and it asks you if you wanna spend the points on a skill?

but then id need an npc for each skill????

lol plz help someone. THANKS :)</description>
