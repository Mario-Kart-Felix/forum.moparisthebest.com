    <description>Hello zero4000 here, I have ran many server including Minecraft, SAMP, and tribal wars lan. SAMP was one that got the most involved with Jacascript and C++. However it was not as indepth as the RSPS. So im looking for someone who has a little extra time to teach me everything I need to know about running a RSPS server professionally. I am new to RSPS but not the Networking/Gaming world.

You will not have to go through anything such as how to host a server, port forward, or anything other then the RSPS Client and Server. I have already been to multiple videos on youtube and the guide within the help section on these forums. I found all these to lack true detail and depth and thus have not helped me at all. I have been studying HTML and Javascript at the Code Academy Online. So I do know the basics of coding. I have skype, a mic and pretty much any ability we would need to comunicate, share screens, and help out.

Thanks,
Zero</description>

<p>As I stated before, I have already been to the help section and found no use out of it. My post states that I am looking for someone to contact me and help on a 1 on 1 level, not give me advice on where to start. I have been searching online for help for about a week now. Sifting through videos, forums, blogs, Ehow. It’s clear to me that I need someone explaining it to me personaly rather then text. Some people need hands on examples to learn, so please as common curtisy if someone asks for milk you don’t give them bread. I asked for someone to contact me and help, not point me to more forums.</p>
<p>Thanks for your fast reply,<br>
Zero</p>
