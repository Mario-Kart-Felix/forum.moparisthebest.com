    <title>Players destroying protected chests - Explanation and apology</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/players-destroying-protected-chests-explanation-and-apology/379419</link>
    <description>I wont go into details about how they did it until Moparisthebest has implemented the plugin I wrote, but basically certain players knew a bug (in the game code, not in LWC) that allowed them to destroy any block, even if it was protected. Thanks to whattehp406, we have identified the bug that was causing the problem, and I wrote a plugin to combat it. 

Sorry to everyone that lost items due to this, but it should be fixed shortly!</description>
