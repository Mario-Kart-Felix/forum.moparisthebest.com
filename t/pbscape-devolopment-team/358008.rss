Base

The base is Deltascape. The server is mainly coded by me and &quot;Unknown&quot;. Unknown was the old source coder / owner but he decided to stop hosting so he gave me his source.



Why do you need a team?
To be very honest i don&#39;t like working solo i find it very boring and i don&#39;t get along with the word &quot;solo&quot; im a person that has to work as a team than solo so hope this answer your question 



VPS/HOST
I recently bought my VPS and we are on VPS right now and runnning :D 


Goal
Well.. my main goal is to just get the server fully completed and get some players..


Skills
Atm all skills are coded and are working.
