    <title>A good PI client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-good-pi-client/357500</link>
    <description>hi guys.
i&#39;m still working on my 317 PI server , you can see the development thread [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,452526.0.html]here[/url].

anyways , it became appearent to me that the client is one of the oldest around...
by that i mean , no gwd , barbabrian assault or anything...

so that&#39;s why i made this thread ; 
i was wondering if you guys know any good clients ( 508+ ) that are compatible with PI server&#39;s...
i AM looking for a good client myself , i am just wondering if you guys know any good ones ( so i don&#39;t have to waste my time d - load one that doesnt work or isnt good )

so all you have to do is leave a link below with the client&#39;s protocol ( 508 , 525 , 562 , etc... )
and what you think of it.
if the client isn&#39;t compatible with PI bases , then don&#39;t post it.

hope to get a good client soon , thx guys</description>
