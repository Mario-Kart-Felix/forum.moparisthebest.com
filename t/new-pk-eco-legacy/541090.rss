[COLOR=&quot;#FF0000&quot;][B]About Legacy:[/B][/COLOR]
[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]Hello and welcome to my thread about the brand new server, Legacy. I&#39;ve always been fond of owning my own RSPS ever since 2008 when I first joined a RSPS community. After many attempts at learning, playing different servers and looking at many sources, 6 years later I have decided it&#39;s time to bring my own RSPS to the internet! Legacy will be a well balanced pking server, where you&#39;re not going to be able to achieve 99&#39;s in a few minutes and become maxed in a day, no. The EXP rates are not super slow nor fast, the combat EXP rate is 100 XP per hit, with Friday&#39;s-Sunday &amp; various skills having different speeds of EXP.

Yes, we&#39;re new and over the next coming weeks you will see many, many updates coming to the game!

[COLOR=&quot;#FF0000&quot;][B]Legacy&#39;s Features:[/B][/COLOR]
[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]Teleport spells have been disabled and you travel around the world using our teleport tabs! [As seen in pics]

Player killing exchange shop for the best player killing items!

Fully working slayer with slayer points, a slayer shop to spend your points will be coming in the next couple of days with some awesome rewards.

We have working WC, Fletching, Firemaking, Crafting, Fishing, Cooking and many more skills!

Currently the available minigame is Barrows, the Barrows teleport tab costs 25,000 and is a lowish chance to receive a barrows item from the chest!
(Barrows has some known bugs and will be fixed perfectly tomorow)[/COLOR]

[COLOR=&quot;#FF0000&quot;][B]To Be Expected:[/B][/COLOR]
[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]Pest Control - You&#39;ll get here just like barrows, you will pay 7,500 GP per PC tab and will able to claim some awesome prizes with your PC Points.

Tzhaar Caves - Just like the other minigames, you will pay 50,000 GP per Tzhaar tab and will be able to play the Jad minigame, Fight pits &amp; kill Tzhaar NPC&#39;s for obsidian items!

More Depth - Over the next coming weeks you will see plenty of updates to do with combat, skilling and pking making them so much more enjoyable and rewarding!

Website/Forums - Within the next week, I will be purchasing domain, hosting and everything for the server when I receive my money. I don&#39;t want to start with a free website as we will just lose most of the website data when switching to the real thing![/COLOR]


[COLOR=&quot;#FF0000&quot;][B]Now it&#39;s time for pictures! Woo![/B][/COLOR]
