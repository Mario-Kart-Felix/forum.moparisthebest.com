    <title>[PI] Auto Donate and More</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-auto-donate-and-more/420388</link>
    <description>Hello, I am in need of Auto Donation being added to my server and webhost.

I do not only want this to be added to my server, but I want to be taught the basics of mySQL for RSPS. Again: I do not want to be spoonfed. I have seen many tutorials/snippets of adding such things as Auto Donation and Highscores, which both are related to mySQL, which I have been unfamiliar with for a long time.

So I want to have mySQL added to my server, but I want someone to show what each thing does, how to add Xaamp, I believe it&#39;s called, and how to manage all of it.

I am not wanting advanced teaching in this, just the basics to be able to add such things as Auto Donation, Highscores, and etc.

I am running low on cash, but I am trying to be able to push out a cash reward if helped effectively and efficiently.

If you are interested in adding Auto Donate to my server and teaching me how to add it and what each part does, (The basics), please comment on this post and add me on my MSN at:

tormentedconnor@live.com

Thank you very much.</description>
