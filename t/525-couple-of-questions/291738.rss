    <title>[525] Couple of Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/525-couple-of-questions/291738</link>
    <description>Hi all,

Well im good at coding 317, i know basics at 508... but 525 is confusing me.

After running 317, and 508 for a while, i decided to switch to 525.

but I cant even find the right file to make myself admin, and i would have no idea where to search next.
Also, i would like to know how to change PvP drops, with that i mean, how to add my custom drops to the PvP list?


Thanks for reading, And if you know, please post youre answer.

Please dont flame, i know this sounds nooby, but seriously im completely new to 525.

(im using w00tsc4p3 source!)
