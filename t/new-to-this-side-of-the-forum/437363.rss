So I decided to broaden my knowledge away from just RSPS programming. To be honest, I wasn&#39;t the best at all. I made one decent release [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,499988.msg3656671.html#msg3656671]here[/url]. Not meaning to advertise. But anyways i basically did nothing but follow like 5 tutorials and edit code. I didnt know what the fuck I was doing. So at the moment im following some really helpful java tutorials and have made quite some progress in [b]understanding[/b] how to program. I noticed its slightly quiet here too so im here to contribute to conversation. And am really looking forward to meeting some new people not from moparscape. Im hoping to release something soon to show some progress. Have a great day guys.</description>

              <p>I don’t really mean to burst your bubble or anything, but I hope you’re aware that developing something from scratch is more than just punching in code, especially when you’re talking about games.<br>
Having said that, don’t be afraid to ask question about stuff, and I guess welcome to this side of the forum.</p>
