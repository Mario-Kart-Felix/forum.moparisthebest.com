    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-commands-to-525-source-solved/293395</link>
    <description>I&#39;m pretty new with 525 servers so could you guys tell me how to add commands to a 525 source? (Preferably commands that add items to your inventory) I found this folder in the source:

I tried studying some of files but I couldn&#39;t figure out what to do.

Please Close I have found what the problem was.</description>
