    <title>Website Template [Made by me, not a leech]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/website-template-made-by-me-not-a-leech/443726</link>
    <description>I&#39;ll just take what I put in my text file (included in download) and post it here.
But first here&#39;s some stuff for the haters/flamers:
I made all but 3 images, those images are; the background behind the nav bar (blue swirl thing), the nav bar background (brown thing with gold tips on either side of nav bar) and the header image (made by my ex hoster for my old PI called EverLastPK.)
It&#39;s not against the rules for me to post this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;4) NEW RULE: NON-SERVER &amp; NON-CLIENT DOWNLOADS ARE ALLOWED (e.g. tools)! This has never been allowed before, but hey, we decided to give it a go. The tool posted must follow all rules and have an appropriate connection to RS2 private servers. If rules start to get broken and content gets out of hand, this rule will be revoked, and no longer will we allow non-server/non-client material to be posted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And finally, I know it isn&#39;t the best, I know it could be cleaned up more. But I like what I&#39;ve done and I&#39;m sure some others will too.
Trust me, I did not leech any of this (besides the 3 images, and one technically isn&#39;t leeched.)
Some media:

[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/31065410/Other/images/7.png[/img]


&lt;blockquote&gt;credits to me, a kid that made the banner you see on all page, and to jagex for the back of the nav bar, and the image that spans behind that and on the bottom.
The site &quot;everlastpk&quot; is MINE. I designed everything for it. I still own the domain.
Do not say I &quot;leeched&quot; or &quot;stole&quot; any of this.
It is all my code what so ever.
I even made the hover images.
I also created the applet code for the web client in the JARmaker.jar, yes you can do that.
Again, This is ALL mine no leeching what so ever.
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to PM me on moparisthebest.com/smf username: sk8rdude461.

Some informal documentation on what html/css is used in the page.

&lt;HTML&gt; What is needed to create the page. Don&#39;t remove unless you are an idiot.
&lt;head&gt; starts off the page, don&#39;t edit this.
&lt;title&gt; (found within &lt;head&gt;) you can edit this. Just change the name and that&#39;s all.
&lt;meta&gt; (Also found in &lt;head&gt;) Don&#39;t fuck with these. There&#39;s about 6 of em. They are hidden parts of the site that web servers i.e google bots use to get info on the site.
&lt;script&gt; (found in &lt;head&gt; and possibly &lt;body&gt;) This just runs a couple of scripts. Don&#39;t play around with the code in them.
&lt;link&gt; This is used to call the css file in each web page.
&lt;body&gt; Controls the main content of the page (Everything you see besides the tab item. That&#39;s in head.)
&lt;p&gt; Feel free to edit this or remove(not on index!!!). It&#39;s paragraph tag, meaning you can type text into it.
&lt;div&gt; Just a seperator tag. Don&#39;t fuck with this. I&#39;m serious.
&lt;/br&gt; Makes a line break. (like when hitting enter.) because html doesn&#39;t understand you press enter. So you add that.
&lt;a&gt; Link items. You need &lt;a href=&quot;link here&quot;&gt;What you want it to say&lt;/a&gt; for it to work. You can add an image into it Just replace the what you want it to say with an image tag (explained below)
&lt;img&gt; The image tag that is used to display images (DERP) you need src=&quot;image link here&quot; for it to work.
&lt;applet well I can&#39;t really explain what it is, but you need it for the webclient.
&lt;param&gt; flash player shit. don&#39;t mess with it.
&lt;object&gt; No clue, was auto generated with the flash player html.
&lt;center&gt; Just centers everything within it.
&lt;!-- Text --&gt; Just like // in java. It&#39;s not seen by anyone but the person editing the page. A comment..

CSS:
Just don&#39;t fuck with it unless you know what you are doing. Ask me for help.

XML:
It is like HTML but like way more custom. The elements defined in the xml file are read by the media player.
Don&#39;t change anything in it besides what I said to change.


How to add songs to the media player (can also be found in the xml file)

1. Open playlist.xml
2. Everything below.
So this is pretty strait foward. Just copy and paste this:
&lt;SONG URL=&quot;audio/&quot; TITLE=&quot;&quot; ARTIST=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
in the playlist block above or below one that is already there.
Then fill in the URL it is at,
The TITLE of the song
And the ARTIST of the song.
You do NOT need to get if off your site as long as you have the DIRECT link, not one that you would need to click the play button in which to listen.
It must be in mp3 format.

3. If you want it to be saved in your site, upload it to the audio folder. if it isn&#39;t on your site remove the audio/ in the block of code.

V2 is way sexier. Has themes, image capabilities, and more. Ask me about it.


Do not fuck with this shit:
&lt;playlist&gt; &lt;/playlist&gt; (you can edit inside of it)
All the &lt;meta tags&gt; unless you know what you are doing.
Do not edit any of the tags, i.e remove them without deleting what is inside of it and the ending tag. say you want to delete a &lt;p&gt; tag. make sure you remove from &lt;p&gt; to &lt;/p&gt; or you can really fuck shit up.
ALL &lt;div&#39;s I&#39;m serious. They are NEEDED!!!!
&lt;head, body, html&gt; the site will not work without em.
css. Just none of it.

Other stuffs:
You can edit/remove/change the images ofc. It&#39;s easiest if you just keep the names the same.
Don&#39;t forget to edit the content in the &lt;title&gt; block on each page

I know i didn&#39;t mention everything. I am honest when I say I AM THE MAKER OF ALL THIS (besides the images said up top.)


Questions? Ask me in a PM on mopar. Username is Sk8rdude461
Love you all in a non gay fashion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally the download:
[url=http://up.ht/LmF9h5]Web template[/url]
Btw it&#39;s on uppit, I can make mirrors
It comes with 3 songs by Billy Idol. :D
I&#39;m sorry if it doesn&#39;t make any sense or what not If you have any issues please tell me I&#39;ll kindly answer any of them.
No malware or virus&#39;s in this I swear (if there is, then idk how the fuck it got there.)

Info on V2 of the media player:
It looks like the iPod classic. It displays the album cover, the song name, and artist. There is currently 2 themes (I can make more) and it has a neat little line that moves to the sound of the music (louder, the more frantic and so on). It has a volume control knob. And that line^ has 3 colors it can be changed to.
PM me about it.

Thnx guys.</description>

I simplified it.<br>
And of course the image is the template, what else would it be? Pandas?<br>
Btw:  works just as well as <br><br>
Both get read the same way by the browser.<br>
I told people not to mess with the <div>'s because they control the nav bar etc.</div>

I took 2, as stated. I actually had to remake the nav bar images (home, support etc.)</p>
<p>Tbh, I don’t even know what instagram is.<br>
All I was doing is releasing something that novice web programmers (like myself) would like to use for a simple, and efficient web client page.<br>
That swf file. Is a lot more work to make then it looks… And my v2 is 20x better.</p>

              <p>I’ll just take what I put in my text file (included in download) and post it here.<br>
But first here’s some stuff for the haters/flamers:<br>
I made all but 3 images, those images are; the background behind the nav bar (blue swirl thing), the nav bar background (brown thing with gold tips on either side of nav bar) and the header image (made by my ex hoster for my old PI called EverLastPK.)<br>
It’s not against the rules for me to post this:</p>
<blockquote>4) NEW RULE: NON-SERVER &amp; NON-CLIENT DOWNLOADS ARE ALLOWED (e.g. tools)! This has never been allowed before, but hey, we decided to give it a go. The tool posted must follow all rules and have an appropriate connection to RS2 private servers. If rules start to get broken and content gets out of hand, this rule will be revoked, and no longer will we allow non-server/non-client material to be posted.</blockquote>
And finally, I know it isn't the best, I know it could be cleaned up more. But I like what I've done and I'm sure some others will too.
Trust me, I did not leech any of this (besides the 3 images, and one technically isn't leeched.)
Some media:
<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/31065410/Other/images/7.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<blockquote>credits to me, a kid that made the banner you see on all page, and to jagex for the back of the nav bar, and the image that spans behind that and on the bottom.
The site "everlastpk" is MINE. I designed everything for it. I still own the domain.
Do not say I "leeched" or "stole" any of this.
It is all my code what so ever.
I even made the hover images.
I also created the applet code for the web client in the JARmaker.jar, yes you can do that.
Again, This is ALL mine no leeching what so ever.
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to PM me on moparisthebest.com/smf username: sk8rdude461.
<p>Some informal documentation on what html/css is used in the page.</p>
 What is needed to create the page. Don't remove unless you are an idiot.
 starts off the page, don't edit this.
 (found within ) you can edit this. Just change the name and that's all.
 (Also found in ) Don't fuck with these. There's about 6 of em. They are hidden parts of the site that web servers i.e google bots use to get info on the site.
 (found in  and possibly ) This just runs a couple of scripts. Don't play around with the code in them.
 This is used to call the css file in each web page.
 Controls the main content of the page (Everything you see besides the tab item. That's in head.)
<p> Feel free to edit this or remove(not on index!!!). It's paragraph tag, meaning you can type text into it.
</p>
<div> Just a seperator tag. Don't fuck with this. I'm serious.
 Makes a line break. (like when hitting enter.) because html doesn't understand you press enter. So you add that.
<a> Link items. You need </a><a>What you want it to say</a> for it to work. You can add an image into it Just replace the what you want it to say with an image tag (explained below)
<img> The image tag that is used to display images (DERP) you need src="image link here" for it to work.
&lt;applet well I can't really explain what it is, but you need it for the webclient.
 flash player shit. don't mess with it.
 No clue, was auto generated with the flash player html.
 Just centers everything within it.
 Just like // in java. It's not seen by anyone but the person editing the page. A comment..
<p>CSS:<br>
Just don’t fuck with it unless you know what you are doing. Ask me for help.</p>
<p>XML:<br>
It is like HTML but like way more custom. The elements defined in the xml file are read by the media player.<br>
Don’t change anything in it besides what I said to change.</p>
<p>How to add songs to the media player (can also be found in the xml file)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open playlist.xml</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything below.<br>
So this is pretty strait foward. Just copy and paste this:<br>
<br>
in the playlist block above or below one that is already there.<br>
Then fill in the URL it is at,<br>
The TITLE of the song<br>
And the ARTIST of the song.<br>
You do NOT need to get if off your site as long as you have the DIRECT link, not one that you would need to click the play button in which to listen.<br>
It must be in mp3 format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want it to be saved in your site, upload it to the audio folder. if it isn’t on your site remove the audio/ in the block of code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>V2 is way sexier. Has themes, image capabilities, and more. Ask me about it.</p>
<p>Do not fuck with this shit:<br>
  (you can edit inside of it)<br>
All the  unless you know what you are doing.<br>
Do not edit any of the tags, i.e remove them without deleting what is inside of it and the ending tag. say you want to delete a </p>
<p> tag. make sure you remove from </p>
<p> to </p> or you can really fuck shit up.<br>
ALL &lt;div’s I’m serious. They are NEEDED!!!<br>
&lt;head, body, html&gt; the site will not work without em.<br>
css. Just none of it.
<p>Other stuffs:<br>
You can edit/remove/change the images ofc. It’s easiest if you just keep the names the same.<br>
Don’t forget to edit the content in the  block on each page</p>
<p>I know i didn’t mention everything. I am honest when I say I AM THE MAKER OF ALL THIS (besides the images said up top.)</p>
<p>Questions? Ask me in a PM on mopar. Username is Sk8rdude461<br>
Love you all in a non gay fashion.</p>
<p>Finally the download:<br>
<a href="http://up.ht/LmF9h5" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Web template</a><br>
Btw it’s on uppit, I can make mirrors<br>
It comes with 3 songs by Billy Idol. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I’m sorry if it doesn’t make any sense or what not If you have any issues please tell me I’ll kindly answer any of them.<br>
No malware or virus’s in this I swear (if there is, then idk how the fuck it got there.)</p>
<p>Info on V2 of the media player:<br>
It looks like the iPod classic. It displays the album cover, the song name, and artist. There is currently 2 themes (I can make more) and it has a neat little line that moves to the sound of the music (louder, the more frantic and so on). It has a volume control knob. And that line^ has 3 colors it can be changed to.<br>
PM me about it.</p>
<p>Thnx guys.</p>
