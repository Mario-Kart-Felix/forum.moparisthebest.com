<p>Idk, I have scored a benchmark Nexus 4 and S3<br>
and nexus came close to a 2200 and S3 came around a 1500 on geekbench (CPU bench)<br>
and Idk, sometimes the nexus seemed sluggish when visiting webpages, but supposedly the hardware is supposedly far superior than S3<br>
Exynos clocked at 1.6ghz vs 1.3ghz (i think)<br>
quadcore vs dual core (us carrier)<br>
But anyhow I would pick nexus 4, because you get direct access to a new android OS when a new one comes out.<br>
S3 isn’t as fast. S voice is dirt. But it feels liquid fast when you swipe and visit webpages.<br>
I like Iphone, I have used it for 2 years now, Im using nexus 4 now though. I think I will be switching back to Iphone when my contract ends</p>

I suppose it depends on the provider and possibly even the retail cost of the handset, but you’re in US so it might even be completely different, I’m with O2 here in England</p>

<p>I’d say the Galaxy S3, although I’ve never used either of the two phones. My friend got the iPhone 5 the day it came out and had it for about a month, then he switched to the Galaxy S3 (spoiled kid, he gets whatever he wants) and still has the Galaxy S3. He said he prefers it over the iPhone 5.</p>

I went there and they were all out of Ipod’s so I was going to buy a Ipad but an Acer laptop cost the same so I said love it and bought the Acer Laptop since I only have a desktop.<br>
[/quote][/quote]<br>
I recommend that you take the laptop back as soon as possible (if you can even return it and get your cash back). Acer is probably one of the worst commercial computers you can buy.</p>

<p>Question 1: Would I be able to use my Iphone as an Ipod if I dont have it activated as an phone?</p>
<p>Question 2: Whats the difference?[/quote]</p>
<p>The difference is purely that an iPhone is basically and iPod with calling, texting, and other phone-like features. However, if you get an unlocked iPhone, it can provide the functions a normal iPod would. There may be some differentiating between the hardware, depending on what generation of iPod/iPhone you’re debating on.</p>
