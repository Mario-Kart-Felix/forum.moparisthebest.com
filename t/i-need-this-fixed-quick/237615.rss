    <title>I need this fixed quick</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-this-fixed-quick/237615</link>
    <description>No one seems to be helping me so here&#39;s the problem! HELP QUICK PLEASE!!!!!!

Ok whenever I do something that brings up a window let&#39;s say bringing up a shop it will d/c me.

What I mean by that is
I go up to the shop owner (Varrock general)
I right click the owner and press trade.
Nothing comes up and I d/c

This problem also d/c me when I do the following..
::bank command
::changecharacter (FIXED) DUNNO HOW
Bring up shop
Etc.

It&#39;s basically with everything that brings up a window. Except manually opening up a bank.

If it&#39;s the bank command can you give me a good bank command.

Also this isn&#39;t a major problem that I need fixed right away like the one above but also whenever I do the ::char and change the character log out and log back in it doesn&#39;t save anyone know how to fix that?


Thanks,</description>
