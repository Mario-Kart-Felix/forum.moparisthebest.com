    <title>sendMessage to players within X distance? [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sendmessage-to-players-within-x-distance-pi/489570</link>
    <description>Well, this one is rather obvious on what I need.
I want a message to be broAdcast  (I know how to implement it into what ever I choose) to players within a certain distance of the player that created the broadcast.
So for instance, say I wanted a command &quot;localyell&quot;
What it would do is send a yell to all players in (lets say) 15 meters (1 walk spot on rs = 1 meter).
How would I accomplish this?

I feel like emulating yell would be the way to go.</description>
