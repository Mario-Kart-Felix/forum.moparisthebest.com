    <title>Server code with up to date jad with healers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-code-with-up-to-date-jad-with-healers/427678</link>
    <description>I&#39;m lloking for the best jad out there, it NEEDS to have healers and sounds and animations up to date, it&#39;d also be nice if spawns were correct and you could safespot it realistically.
I don&#39;t care if you have to go through the 63 waves as long as I can modify the code to remove them.
If you know of a server where you can skip all 62 waves to jad and jad has healers and realistic sounds and animations that&#39;d be great.
Thanks.</description>

              <p>thanks I did that but there are no .bats<br>
I called “ant resolve” “ant build” and “ant run” on apollo dir but it gives me an error on “ant run”<br>
It says no index files present, do I need to download or install moparscape or anything?</p>

<p>I have downloaded apollo, is it a server? how do I run it and why does it weigh 700kbs</p>

</aside>
<p>Use this:</p>
<p>[quote=“Zenocko, post:1, topic:427852”]Purpose: Setup apollo server<br>
Difficulty: 8/10<br>
Knowledge needed: Environmental Variables, CMD prompt<br>
Credits:<br>
Graham for making apollo so damn hard to setup</p>
<p>Pre-tutorial warning: this guide is <span class="bbcode-u">noob friendly</span>, but it is very long.</p>
<p><img src="http://apollo-server.tumblr.com/photo/1280/656823617/1/tumblr_l3e6rtcBdj1qc81qx" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Step 1(Download server files):<br>
Download apollo server from here: <a data-bbcode="true">Apollo - Edited by Zenocko to included 317 cache/batch files</a><br>
Download a 317 Client from here: <a data-bbcode="true">317 client loading 377 cache</a></p>
<p>Step 2(Download apache/ivy files):<br>
Download apache ant here: <a data-bbcode="true">Apache Ant 1.8.2</a><br>
Download apache ivy here: <a data-bbcode="true">Apache Ivy 2.2.0</a></p>
<p>Step 3(Setup ant):<br>
Extract apache ant anywhere and put it in C:\Program Files, so it looks like this: <code>C:\Program Files\apache-ant-1.8.2</code><img src="http://troll.ws/i/kOxnix.png" alt width="" height="">.</p>
<p>Step 4(Install environmental variables for ant):<br>
Go to Start -&gt; [COLOR=red]<em>right-click</em>[/COLOR] My Computer -&gt; Properties<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/9s76ZM.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>On the properties menu, click [COLOR=red]“Advanced system settings”[/COLOR] on the right.<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/7cS14W.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>On the system properties menu, make sure your on the “Advanced” tab. At the bottom, click on [COLOR=red]“Environment Variables…”[/COLOR]<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/Rvo9vR.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>On the Environmental Variables menu, click the [COLOR=red"“New…”[/COLOR] button on the top half.<br>
In the “Variable name:” field put <code>ANT_HOME</code>In the “Variable value:” field put the location of your ant directory. Mine is: <code>C:\Program Files\apache-ant-1.8.2</code> It should look something like this:<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/q1y3NU.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=red]Repeat that again^[/COLOR]</span> but this time put the “Variable name:” field put <code>JAVA_HOME</code>In the “Variable value:” field put the location of your java jdk directory. Mine is: <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_25</code> It should look something like this:<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/ZJZp4Z.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Once you have the ANT_HOME and JAVA_HOME variables declared, look at the bottom half system variables and scroll down to [COLOR=red]“Path”[/COLOR] and click the [COLOR=red]“Edit…”[/COLOR] button.<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/lobfa3.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>On the Edit System Variable for Path on the bottom “variable value:” scroll to the end of the value field and add: <code>;C:\Program Files\apache-ant-1.8.2\bin</code><br>
Make sure there is a " ; " semicolon between your ant location and whatever was before it. For exmaple: <code>C:\blah\blah\bin;C:\derp\bin;C:\Program Files\apache-ant-1.8.2\bin</code></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[SIZE=“5”]Congrats thats the hard part. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cookie.png?v=5" title=":cookie:" class="emoji" alt=":cookie:">[/SIZE]</span></p>
<p>Step 5(Check to see if ant works):<br>
Open command prompt by pressed start -&gt; search bar -&gt; type “CMD”<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/ys89H1.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>In command prompt, type <code>ant</code>. If you get this message then you installed ant correctly<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/ISEVK9.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Step 6(Install apache ivy):<br>
Extract apache ivy to wherever. Open the apache ivy folder and copy the jar file in there:<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/cj3ZKn.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Copy the Ivy jar file and navigate to the apache ant lib folder <code>C:\Program Files\apache-ant-1.8.2\lib</code>  directory and paste the ivy jar file in there.<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/s4SrO8.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Now that the ivy jar file is in the apache directory. Navigate to your ivy folder again and open up [COLOR=red]src -&gt; example -&gt; hello-ivy[/COLOR]. Once your in the [COLOR=red]hello-ivy[/COLOR] folder[COLOR=red] Hold shift key and right click on your mouse.[/COLOR] Click “Open command window here”<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/ZCvC5B.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>In the command window type <code>ant</code> and press enter. A shit-ton of code should pop-up and after a few seconds it should say “BUILD SUCCESSFUL”<br>
<img src="http://troll.ws/i/F2xxC5.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>You have now installed apache ivy. Now we can get started on running the server! :drool:</p>
<p>Step 6(Running server):<br>
Extract the apollo.zip file you downloaded in step 1. Open the folder and run “[COLOR=red]resolve.bat[/COLOR]”. You only need to [COLOR=red]run this once[/COLOR], it will download any needed libraries and exit within a few seconds. Now run “[COLOR=red]1Compile.bat[/COLOR]” to compile all of the scripts/files. After compiling, you can run “[COLOR=red]2Run.bat[/COLOR]” to start the server!</p>
<p>Thats it. You can now run/program Graham’s apollo server. Use the compile batch to compile all of your edits, and use the run batch to run the server. These batch files did not come in Graham’s original post, I added them for easy of access. [COLOR=red]<span class="bbcode-i">To fix the ‘batch files is that some times I will have to open task manager and kill java.exe because the JVM becomes binded to port 43594/43595.’ problem, edit your batch files and add “end” at the bottom after pause(thanks caboose)</span>[/COLOR]</p>

<p>I do not give permission to repost this tutorial anywhere. I have already posted it on mopar, r-s, and rb under my own name.</p>
<p>Post any help questions/comments/ideas here. Rep++ if I helped, spent a good 2 hours on this tut.[/quote]</p>

<p>Honestly players don’t care about this. You’ll need to make them yourself. I believe some higher revisions have sound already, but only some sound. I don’t recommend you skip 317 and move to 474+ by the way.</p>

If I just start from a vanilla server (like moparscapes homepage) and put jad in the fight cave) will it automatically spawn where runescape spawns it? Will it make the animations and sounds? I have been through some servers where it didn’t do any of these, sometimes it skipped animations etc…<br>
It just seems hard that I can do it better from scratch than what the server coders did.<br>

Their is no server that has it 100% like jad on runescape, even with all the waves. Everyone’s server is basically the same, but none are like RuneScape. You would have to code it in to your server if you want it 99% like RuneScape.</p>
<p>Your lucky if you will find a server that even has working healers, because i’ve never seen one.</p>

Your sarcasm isn’t appreciated, I am looking to skip all 62 waves so I can practice jad directly. Unless you can download the source code of the original fight caves and reprogram it to skip 62 waves then your post is useless.</p>

              <p>I’m lloking for the best jad out there, it NEEDS to have healers and sounds and animations up to date, it’d also be nice if spawns were correct and you could safespot it realistically.<br>
I don’t care if you have to go through the 63 waves as long as I can modify the code to remove them.<br>
If you know of a server where you can skip all 62 waves to jad and jad has healers and realistic sounds and animations that’d be great.<br>
Thanks.</p>
