<p>Do you know none of them are real, or is it the fact they are not enforced anymore. Most of the laws on that list are just not enforced anymore, but are real laws.</p>

From just ‘streaming’ around, I found another one, with even the lollipop law.</p>
<p>Another, with even more Washington laws.<br>

<p>Please, I would get a list of current Washington laws before accusing this. Every state has stupid laws. Just because you live there, and have done some of them, does not mean its not illegal, its just that it is not enforced anymore.<br>
[/quote]Oh, I thought you meant that these were all current laws.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They are, laws cannot really be undone once put into effect, but they can stop enforcing them. For example, in Michigan, the state I am in for the next year, It is illegal for a women to cut her hair, unless she has her husbands permission. No, it is not enforced anymore, but it is a current law, that if someone brought up on their wife, they would have to enforce it. It is just not publicly done unless brought up.[/quote]Ever heard of repealing?</p>
<p>EDIT: Even at the top of the page, the author says:</p>
<blockquote>I suspect some have been repealed, and a few may even be fictional, but I have no direct knowledge, so please don't take them too seriously - this is not a law manual!</blockquote>

<p>Please, I would get a list of current Washington laws before accusing this. Every state has stupid laws. Just because you live there, and have done some of them, does not mean its not illegal, its just that it is not enforced anymore.<br>
[/quote]Oh, I thought you meant that these were all current laws.[/quote]</p>
<p>They are, laws cannot really be undone once put into effect, but they can stop enforcing them. For example, in Michigan, the state I am in for the next year, It is illegal for a women to cut her hair, unless she has her husbands permission. No, it is not enforced anymore, but it is a current law, that if someone brought up on their wife, they would have to enforce it. It is just not publicly done unless brought up.</p>

<p>Those are not even the worst. Pennsylvania has one that makes it legal to kill Native Americans <span class="bbcode-b">IF</span> they are in a crowd of 5 or more. As well, Texas has something about a horse and $100 being given to you when you get out of prison. Another one has something similar, but its a horse and a shotgun if you ask for it.</p>
