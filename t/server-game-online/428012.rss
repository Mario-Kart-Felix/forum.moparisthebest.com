    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-game-online/428012</link>
    <description>Okay, I just got my game all fixed up like 2 days ago... Now, I have it all advertised in alot of places. I did this the same way for my friends server and got him alot of people.. But, I don&#39;t see anyone ever on. If someone could please beta test this for me. I only need one person just to tell me if there getting an error or something... I have no way of testing this. I did check some sites and it says its online but after being advertised for 2 days not one person would get online.. Thank for your help...</description>
