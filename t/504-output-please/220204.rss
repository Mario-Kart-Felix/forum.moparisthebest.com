Other than the fact I posted that as soon as I got Kubuntu working, SURE! Despite the fact I didn’t even know the console then.</p>
<p>Also, the fact you called frank_ an asshole made me laugh, actually. When was the last time you spoke to frank_ one on one? Sure he is a little ragey, but it’s funny. I love how people think he’s unapproachable, despite the fact he is one of the most approachable people on the forum, just don’t be a fucktard upon asking him the question.</p>
