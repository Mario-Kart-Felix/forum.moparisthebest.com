        <p>I’ll be honest, it’s been years wince i’ve messed around with any sort of Java coding or related RSPS material. I’m in a position now where i’m able to contribute to a project of my own, so here I am…As mentioned above, treat me as if I have almost no experience coding as it’s been quite sometime since i’ve played around with Java. Here’s what i’m looking for…</p>
<p>1…<span class="bbcode-b">A partner (Or two) with some experience in coding an RSPS who would be willing to contribute to my new project. (I’m open to learning as development moves along, if that interests anyone)</span></p>
<p>2…<span class="bbcode-b">A(n) Individual(s) who are able to be decently active in both coding the server and communicating with me. (Real life always comes first, of course. I just don’t want to see you once and never have contact with you again. My work keeps me very busy during week days so I would only be around in the afternoons. Weekends are the most open for me.)</span></p>
<p>3…<span class="bbcode-b">I’m not looking for children to work with on this project…Meaning, i’m looking for people who can do the work I need done without the extra drama and nonsense. (Professionalism would be the perfect word in this case. Even in something like working on an RSPS project.)</span></p>
<p>4…<span class="bbcode-b">This section could possibly tie into the last few points i’ve made, but i’ll say it again, personality does matter on some level. Keep it classy is all I ask. (I feel like i’m coming off too ridged so i’ll add that I don’t expect this project to be all serious all around. I’m a pretty nice and laid back guy, enjoying the work is what produces good quality in my opinion.) </span></p>
<p>Cheesy personal feelings aside, here’s what I can offer. I won’t make you slave away while I sit back, promise…</p>
<p>1…<span class="bbcode-b">Funds to start up the launch of the server. This includes; Paying for a VPS, Website (I’m currently using enjin), maintaining a Paypal for donations (Already set-up), and any other general costs that may come up.</span></p>
<p>2…<span class="bbcode-b">50/50 on donations received or an equal three-way split if it comes to it. Point is, I won’t leave you high and dry, ignoring the work you put in.</span></p>
<p>3…<span class="bbcode-b">I shouldn’t have to say that you’ll also receive a staff spot on the server (Co-owner for my main developer and Admin for any extra people brought on to the project).</span></p>
<p>4…<span class="bbcode-b">I’m open to using whatever is comfortable to my developer as far as clients and such go. As long as you have the know-how to change the things like shops, items, etc. I won’t be picky about which you use. With that said, I tend to lean more towards 317s as i’m more of a fan of those old style graphics, i’ll still be willing to work out all those details later.</span></p>
<p>That’s about it…I’ve been wanting to do this for awhile and now that I have the means to support a server, i’m ready to bring the development forward. Feel free to respond to this thread, PM me here, or Email me. Skype can be used to talk as we begin the project, however in terms of getting into contact via Skype, it’d be easier to use the other contact points mentioned above. Before I end this, i’ll apologize for sounding overly formal or cheesy…Hopefully it only reassures that one or two people i’m looking for just how committed I am to this new project.</p>
