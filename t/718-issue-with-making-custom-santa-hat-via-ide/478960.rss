    <title>[718] Issue with making custom santa hat via IDE!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-issue-with-making-custom-santa-hat-via-ide/478960</link>
    <description>I am trying to mess around learn customizing and such.  I have done phats and a few other things.  I tried making a custom Santa but every time I create it then test i can wear it but the hat is still red, and is not black or lime green, (the colors i made the custom hats).  I will post an SS below and see if anyone can help assisting me and give suggestions?  I tried putting the color IDs in model color only, texture only, and as seen in the pic in BOTH.  Nothing! :(.  I&#39;m obviously typing the color code wrong, can anyone help?  Thanks!!
