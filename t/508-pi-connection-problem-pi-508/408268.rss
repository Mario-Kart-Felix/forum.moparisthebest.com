    <description>Whenever I try to load my client on another problem to test if it&#39;s working, it always goes straight to connection error. I&#39;m using a 508 client. I have no-ip, and I have done the port forwarding. I&#39;ve changed the ip the client connects too, but it still gets a error. Any help at all would be appreciated.


Also, it works on my computer, but no one elses. I&#39;m not sure if i have done the port forwarding right. And there are no guides on how to port forward with my router on port forward.com

So if someone could help me out via Teamviewer or something else, I would be so grateful.</description>

              <p>I’m pretty certain Project Insanity is a 317 loading whatever crappy graphics into it. So if you have the wrong client version change that. If you do have the correct client. try going into where the IP is handled and double checking it is the correct IP adrress E.g not 127.0.0.1 … If that doesn’t work perhaps re-trying the portforwarding process could be a option. Other then that I have no other solutions…</p>
