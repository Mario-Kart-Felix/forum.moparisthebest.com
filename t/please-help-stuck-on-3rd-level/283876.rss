    <title>PLEASE HELP! - Stuck on 3rd level</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-stuck-on-3rd-level/283876</link>
    <description>On my own server, whenever I log on, even with a new account, I always appear to be on the 3rd level. The global objects appear on my level but no npc&#39;s or other players do. I have also edited the character&#39;s level to zero, but he always stays on the 3rd level. Could someone please help me with a ::ground code or something like that, because I am really screwed.  :(</description>

<p>Check your initialize method and see if it sets your height to 3 anywhere.</p>
