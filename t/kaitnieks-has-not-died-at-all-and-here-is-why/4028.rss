    <title>Kaitnieks has not died at all.....and here is why</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kaitnieks-has-not-died-at-all-and-here-is-why/4028</link>
    <description>kaitnieks was a site that helped so many people with scar and other scripts as well as servers...and when it shut I was very disappointed but then i came to realize that missing that site was &quot;stupid&quot; because it has not died and it still exists but under a new name....this site is its own kaitnieks.
It&#39;s full of people willing and eager to help others out just like kaitnieks, if this post is in the wrong section please do with it as fit. but everyone please know that kaitnieks was just the beginning of something greater then any have noticed....through that site many others have made sites to help others.
that site has started a huge community where scripters, programers,&quot;hackers&quot;,an creative people could come together and share their knowledge and Accomplishments with others that all share the same interest...

those are my words of inspiration.
[if this post is stupid to others then delete it or move it just read it.]

&lt;blockquote&gt;As long as there is a man to lend a helping hand then man can expand his mind beyond the stars...&lt;/blockquote&gt;^-J.T.M.W</description>

There is a forum that Josh has created and is hosting, www.autoruneltd.co.uk.

I'm selling kaitnieks.com domain and forums on condition that forums are kept running and not changed for worse. If you have a serious offer, contact me at aispam at serveris.lv.

If all goes well, the forums will be back next week.
