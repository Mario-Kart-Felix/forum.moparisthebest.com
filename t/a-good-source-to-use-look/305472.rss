    <title>A good source to use? Look</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-good-source-to-use-look/305472</link>
    <description>I am wondering what is a good server-base (I don&#39;t care if its custom as long as it follows what features I want) to develop. I am planning to replicate Runescape 2 from the year 2007-08 or maybe earlier and I don&#39;t know what server base to use as I have not coded a Runescape 2 server is a long time. 

Note - I currently develop Runescape Classic private servers so bare with me here.

I need a server that:
-Has little or no custom features that Jagex did not implement into Runescape 2
-Works with a cache of at least 317 - 425 (or any cache that was used in 07-08
-Very Stable
-Doesn&#39;t use mysql

Also, I don&#39;t care if the server is &quot;hard to code&quot; as I seen some people prefer Delta source over other sources due to it being &quot;easy to code&quot;.

Any suggestions? Also I would appreciate links to threads of a base!</description>
