    <title>Client Required?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-required/320261</link>
    <description>How do I make it so you do not NEED to use my client to login to my server. Like when ever anyone tries to log in using moparscape webclient, or anything else, it just logs in and out quickly. The only way is using the client. Is there anyway to make it so that they can still log in using whatever they want? If you could help in anyway that would be great, Thanks.</description>
