    <title>Blank source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blank-source/289598</link>
    <description>Hello, i am looking to start a project of coding a 317 source. I want to make use this project to help further my skills in java. I want to start on a &quot;Blank source&quot;, but i do not want something like a cleaned delta source or anything like that. I would like to really start from a blank source, nothing on it at all. Could someone help me by telling me what to do to get such a source? I know that i would have to add animations and all, but i really want to do this. All help is appreciated!</description>
