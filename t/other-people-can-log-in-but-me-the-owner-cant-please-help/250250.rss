              <p>yea it happened to me to<br>
then i realized i had to set the server as 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1<br>
its very rare that the owner logs on with “<a href="http://yourname.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">yourname.no-ip.org</a>”</p>

              <p>Is it saying “error connecting to server”? If it is, it might be because lots of player are already on and it’s making it hard for you or anyone else to get on. It might be your internet. I know this because I have the same problem. I suggest getting faster internet, maybe? That’s what I’m doing.</p>
