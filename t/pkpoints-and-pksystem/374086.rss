    <description>ok so me and my friend ryan are back to codeing servers :P ive got a donator zone, shops, npc&#39;s training ect ect, but i really would like to get a pkpoint shop up. ive seen in a few clients there is a &quot;wanneshop&quot; thing thats speically for pkpoint shops. or w/e. so heres my question

1. how do i add a pkpoint system ? so that you get say... 1 pk point per kill?
2. in character files how do i make it say &quot;pkpoints&quot; for instance like... donator = 0 for non donators. playerrights = 0 for non staff ect ect?

info. this is a 317. download client. no webclient yet. runesworld is name. my friend ryan found the client and source here. i made it completely blank all accept for custom items, everything else has been coded &quot;by me&quot; in addition to... npc&#39;s, shops, teleports, commands, interfaces blah blah blah. anyway someone help?</description>
