              <p>This is not the proper section for a topic like this. It breaks the rule about specific servers and is a request. The only way to get sounds and music playing outside of a browser is to implement your own sound player. Tutorials for it are at <a href="http://rune-serba.org" rel="nofollow noopener">rune-serba.org</a></p>

You’re a fucking idiot.[/quote]</p>
<p>When I try to play sounds or music with other PI client, it throws T2 Errors. Fuck off, so I’m not as smart as you with RSPS. You don’t have to cuss and be an asshole about it.</p>

<p>Don’t just simply assume that the first PI client you see is the only existent one ever with sound and music, I laughed so hard irl. I know for a fact Project-Rebirth supports that, even though its not PI it’s actually Emulous.<br>

<p>I tried using Project Rebirth client for my PI, but it has custom interfaces so it won’t login. It only works with the specific server.</p>
<p>Do you know of a client with a 317 gameframe that supports music and sounds? I will pay if you want.[/quote]</p>
<p>The gameframe has nothing to do with it whatsoever, it’s probably either got a UID or the ip address or port was incorrect.</p>
