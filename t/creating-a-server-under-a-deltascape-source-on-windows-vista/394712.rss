    <title>Creating a server under a deltascape source on windows vista?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-server-under-a-deltascape-source-on-windows-vista/394712</link>
    <description>Okay, so I&#39;ve been trying to setup a server again but this time around I&#39;m failing twice as hard as in 2009, aha, and was wondering if someone could be of help? i&#39;m interested in the deltascape source, and already have one downloaded. I&#39;ve done the no-ip port forwarding so that should be covered. whats the next steps? I want to start learning java coding so this might be a good start. For people that are experienced coders feel free to pm me your msn ill be happy to discuss this more with someone who works with java well.</description>
