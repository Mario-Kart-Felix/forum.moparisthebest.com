    <title>A sneak peak of hybridscape final and the basics of the packet system</title>

    <description>Mind you i converted it to just do a quick demo however you can see with this demo just how flexible the packet system is.  once you get it loaded up with either intellij, or apache ant feel free to use any deob 317 client on it. it will do the whole login packet for ya and print the user name and password.  of course this is nothing spectacular but i felt a demo was nessesary. to show that their are other methods to the whole private server idea.  feel free to comment or not or do the usual what the hell is this.

              <p>Very nice Miss Silabsoft, Could help me in my development of my idea of a rsc sql based server.<br>
By sql based i mean alot of it will be stored in sql databases…<br>
Just an experiment really and maybe an attempt at bringing that section back to life.</p>
