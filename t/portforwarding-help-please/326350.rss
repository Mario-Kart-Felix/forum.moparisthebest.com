    <title>Portforwarding Help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-help-please/326350</link>
    <description>Ok So I successfully port forwarded. (Checked using the port checker tool) But i think something maybe wrong because my server is only letting people who are connected to my network connect my server. Does anyone know how I can make it to were everyone can connect? Any and all help is appreciated. 

-Thanks

<p>control panel<br>
windows fire wall<br>
exceptions<br>
