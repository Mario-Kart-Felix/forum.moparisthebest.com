    <description>The very second I had finished this, kmb locked the other thread. I think it still needs to be said.

It is disconcerting that certain individuals are free to sling random insults for no apparent reason with zero reprimand beyond a thread being locked.

Anyhow, original contents:

[quote=&quot;RLN&quot;]Zappacky is a fag [b][i]--snippage--[/i][/b] Most of the time i come off as an asshole, but most people that think so are fucking stupid and i flamed them for it or they don&#39;t understand why I flamed someone else. Its not like i just call everyone a fag for nothing, i just usually don&#39;t post why. [b][i]--moresnippage--[/i][/b][/quote]

As I said in the other dcthugs thread, as I very politely phrased it above in this thread:

Please, elsewhere.

This is supposed to be a forum for the at least moderately more competent and mature people to read, so that we don&#39;t have to wade through the elephantine piles in the other boards. No one here cares that you think so-and-so is so-very-homosexual for such-and-such reason that you never bother to specify anyhow.

The last time we discussed this, your response was that I have &quot;no authority&quot; and I&#39;m not here to &quot;police&quot; the forums. Which is 100% correct, and 100% my point: you&#39;re just shy of a grown ass man, you shouldn&#39;t [b]need[/b] policing.

I am sure no one would mind you filling up XYZ person&#39;s spambox with tons of ambiguous, overstated yet remarkably generic insults. I encourage it wholeheartedly; flame to your heart&#39;s content.

One last time:

Anywhere else, fine.

Just not here.

Thank you.</description>

<p>Being an ass and acting like an ass is two different things. I’m an ass, I am generally in the state of being of that of an ass hole… Acting like an ass, is something you’d use to refer to someone who’s as dimwitted and genetically declined as a donkey, for instance, GenoDemon.</p>
<p>In all reality though, the fact that there is a 3 page discussion on behavior, and the fact that it’s really the only “active” community member topic shows leaps and bounds about the status quo of <a href="http://mitb.com" rel="nofollow noopener">mitb.com</a>.</p>

As to the removing of private servers, I have done that in just about every way possible, the only thing that connects the two sites is the user database and administration, not even rep is shared between the two sites anymore.</p>
<p>Pruning the members, what good would that really do unless I were to close registrations, which will never happen?</p>
<p>As to community projects, I try to get some things started but no one seems to want to help out or get involved.  I wrote a solid base for a Bot, and no one wanted to help do anything with it.  I wrote an IDE, and there were some suggestions for it, but again no one wanted to do anything with it. Part of the community started to write a private server, HybridScape, and it started out good but then died off and the only one currently working on it is Miss Silabsoft.</p>
<p>The next thing I am going to start is a bytecode updater using BCEL, implementing some type of transform interface so that anyone can write a class to find a new field, method, or class.  And although it would be nice for everyone to contribute so that we could find every method, field, or class anyone would need, I imagine that probably won’t happen much either.</p>
<p>So what do you suggest I do different to get people involved in ‘Community Projects’?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Those were community projects? You just released them. You didn’t go ‘Ok guys, here’s a base for a bot, this is a new community project. Create a bot :)’</p>
<p>Anyway, yeh, more community projects ftw.[/quote]</p>
<p>That is what I thought I was saying:</p>
<p>[quote=“moparisthebest, post:1, topic:44797”]This is as you see a very early beta, and not a finished product.  I ask for any and all suggestions I can get on my structure, implementation, or anything really.  The part that I worked very hard on and tested very thoroughly is the contents of the com.cherokee.event package, with the tester app I wrote I made sure every input was identical to human input, not leaving out the slightest detail, if anyone has suggestions for it, or sees where it could be detectable, please let me know.</p>
<p>Lastly, if anyone would like to volunteer their time on either the programming of the bot or updater, I am looking for a dev team, so just volunteer. :)[/quote]</p>

<p>IDK, radio.</p>
<p>Project wise i think you are doing some cool things. Though most older members now generally, cant be bothered any more or, now being older, have college and such so cant be as active as they used to be.</p>
<p>The newer generations are more caught up in private server developing then working out how the rs client works, or making clients or bots. There does appear to be some movement though, recently.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t mind making some tutorials if it means people are going to get started with their own stuff. If anyone could give some idea’s, that would be of much help.</p>
<p>Although rs cheating is not very important in actual life. It would be a shame to see it die out.</p>

<p>IMO, we should have moved away from Kaits a long time ago, but Mopar doesn’t seem to do anything. I don’t know why. Sure Kaitnieks was a great forum, but we should move on and be known as ‘moparisthebest’ not ‘The Kaitnieks immitation’.</p>
<p>With all due respect Mopar, please sort this community out, for good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove everything to do with P Servers</li>
<li>Prune the members</li>
<li>Get more community projects going. Don’t let a group of 7 people create the project, let everyone put in their own code. The community projects don’t just have to be bots, they could be anything</li>
<li>Become very strict with what is, and isn’t accepted here. There doesn’t seem to be any friendly community at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things need to be done mopar, and you can’t just sit back and hope for the best. You need to make the changes.</p>
