<p>Yeah, but it’s much easier to start merching with 10m compared to 500k.</p>

<p>If you guys want the whole story, I got to 19m and got hacked by someone I thought was a trust-able person. Then I didn’t know what to do so I tried to recover my old account (radicalradzz) and after I got him back he had like 2m in items on it so I started to merch on it, then after a week or two I had 30m and I paid back my 10m debt that I was going to pay back on ilivetoomerch when I got to 50m and then I kept merching from there (: and yay im a likable new fag :3</p>
