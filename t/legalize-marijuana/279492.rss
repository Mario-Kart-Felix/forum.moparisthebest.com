    <title>Legalize marijuana</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/legalize-marijuana/279492</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if I should bring up such a controversial subject around such a young age group, but I don&#39;t encourage anyone to do drugs and hopefully we can have a mature debate.

Should marijuana be legalized?

I say yes. And these are some of the reasons why:

So I think most people&#39;s first concern with marijuana are the possible health risks. But what do the studies say? How bad is marijuana really?

How does weed effect the brain? 
The only study claiming brain damage is the rhesus monkey study, done by Dr. Robert Heath in the late 1970’s. The study was heavily criticized for having only 4 subjects to test on and its experimental bias. In order to achieve these results, doses up to 200 times the psychoactive dose in humans were given. A newer study was done by Dr. William Slikker at the National Center for Toxicological Research in Arkansas, and this time 64 rhesus monkeys were used. The monkeys were exposed to marijuana smoke daily or weekly for a year. No evidence of structural or neurochemical changes were found in the brains of the monkeys. A similar study was done by Gordon T. Pryor and Charles Rebert at SRI International in California. Thirty rhesus monkeys inhaled marijuana smoke one to three times a day for periods of 6 to 12 months. Again, no evidence of structural or neurochemical changes were found in the brains of the monkeys. Some behavioral changes in the monkey were noticed, but wore off when they were taken off the marijuana. Two other studies in 1977 that were published by the Journal of the American Medical Association showed no evidence of brain damage in heavy users of marijuana. Contrary to popular belief, killing brain cells is not a prerequisite for getting high.

How does marijuana affect your lungs?
Many anti-drug organizations claim weed is worse than smoking tobacco because it deposits 4 times more tar into your lungs than a filtered cigarette. However, studies that concluded this data used the entire plant when testing the tar content. Marijuana users only smoke the buds, they do not smoke the stems, roots, leaves, and seeds. Later studies tested only the bud, and found that it actually contains 3 times less tar than tobacco. Many tobacco smokers smoke as many as 25 cigarettes a day. A light marijuana smoker might smoke a marijuana joint once every couple of weeks. A heavy user might smoke one joint a day. Marijuana is safer than tobacco. Weed can actually benefit the lungs in some ways. It is an expectorant, which means it helps remove mucus and other materials from the lungs. In addition to this, marijuana dilates the air channels. This gives it the ability to remove smog and other pollutants from the lungs. People who smoke tobacco and weed live an average of 7 years longer than just tobacco smokers. A major concern is that marijuana could cause cancer because it contains some carcinogens. However, a new study done by the University of California has shown marijuana has no link to cancer. The main active chemical in marijuana, THC, has been proven to kill aging and mutating cells and thus preventing cells from becoming cancerous. If a user feels it is not worth the risk of lung damage, they have several other options. A water bong can be used to cool the smoke and filter out many unwanted chemicals from the plant. Another way is to use a vaporizer. A vaporizer heats the marijuana to a certain temperature where only the THC is vaporized, and when a user inhales it they are getting a pure THC vapor and no other plant constituent. The best option for someone trying to avoid lung damage is to consume it orally. The marijuana is cooked into an oil, fat, or alcohol so that it can be absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. This is a sure proof method for avoiding lung damage.

How does marijuana affect hormones?
It is commonly believed that marijuana causes testosterone levels to drop in men. However, this is not true. In 1974, Dr. R.C. Kolodony reported lower testosterone in men who smoke marijuana. A newer study done by Dr. Robert Block from the University of Iowa found that the use of marijuana, even heavy use, has absolutely no effect on testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, prolactin, or cortisol in men or women. Six other studies also failed to show that marijuana lowers testosterone.

What does it do to the immune system?
Another misconception about marijuana is that it harms the immune system. This myth is based on studies where lab rodents were given doses of THC that were about one thousand times the dose needed for psychoactive effects in humans, every day. This is far too high of a dose, and not an accurate reflection to compare it with an average marijuana user. In 30 days, the animals were back to normal again. No study has ever shown an increase in bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection in marijuana users. In fact, three large studies done in the 1970’s in Jamaica, Costa Rica and Greece have found no difference in disease susceptibility for marijuana users. A study done in 1978 and a study done in 1988 both showed that marijuana can actually stimulate the immune system.

The gateway theory. Does marijuana lead to harder drugs?
Many critics of marijuana will argue that even if it isn’t harmful to your health, it is a gateway drug and will lead to the use of harder drugs such as cocaine and heroin. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A real world
example of what happens when marijuana is readily available can be
found in Holland.  The Dutch partially legalized marijuana in the
1970s.  Since then, hard drug use -- heroin and cocaine -- have
DECLINED substantially.  If marijuana really were a gateway drug,
one would have expected use of hard drugs to have gone up, not
down.  This apparent &quot;negative gateway&quot; effect has also been
observed in the United States.  Studies done in the early 1970s
showed a negative correlation between use of marijuana and use of
alcohol.  A 1993 Rand Corporation study that compared drug use in
states that had decriminalized marijuana versus those that had not,
found that where marijuana was more available -- the states that
had decriminalized -- hard drug abuse as measured by emergency room
episodes decreased.  In short, what science and actual experience
tell us is that marijuana tends to substitute for the much more
dangerous hard drugs like alcohol, cocaine, and heroin.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There have been no relationships between the patterns of marijuana and the use of other drugs over time. For instance, in the 1960’s and 1970’s marijuana use increased a lot, but heroin use decreased. 

Can you overdose? How many people have died directly from marijuana?
No one in recorded history has ever died from marijuana.

&lt;blockquote&gt;       Tobacco...............................340,000 - 395,000
       Alcohol (excluding crime/accidents).............125,000+
       Drug Overdose (prescription)............24,000 - 27,000
       Drug Overdose (illegal)...................3,800 - 5,200
       Marijuana.............................................0

I would be happy to debate any other health information you have. For now I&#39;ll get onto some more reasons to legalize it.

Drug prohibition causes more crime. If drugs were legalized and regulated, violent drug gangs couldn&#39;t exist, they wouldn&#39;t be able to make money. 
If marijuana was legalized, it could be taxed and regulated. The government could make a lot of profit. It would be higher quality and more pure compared to street drugs, thus reducing some of the harms. Laws could be put into place about driving high, or doing it in public. And also lets face it, the law doesn&#39;t influence your descision if your going to smoke it or not, so not everyone is going to suddenly become a stoner if it was legalized. If you were against it before, you will still be against it after.

How about medical marijuana? I&#39;ll keep this short. But if not for recreational users, it needs to be legalized for medical purposes. 

Marijuana is a very effective medicine for a wide range of illnesses with very few side effects. It is beneficial to cancer patients in several ways. It helps with the pain and nausea generally associated with cancer, but it is generally used to help combat the nausea and other negative effects caused from chemotherapy. It also stimulates the appetite, which is useful because cancer patients often develop anorexia, the loss of appetite or desire to eat. If a cancer patient is not comfortable with smoking marijuana, they can take the prescription pill Marinol, which is a pill that can be consumed orally and contains THC. And because of the growing evidence of marijuana killing potential cancer cells, it could help in other ways as well.

Marijuana is useful for treating AIDS for many of the same reasons as cancer. AIDS can cause extreme nausea, and marijuana is very effective for curing this. AIDS will also cause a severe loss of appetite. AIDS patients are known to literally waste away, sometimes losing hundreds of pounds. Marijuana will help them eat better and improve their quality of life and even help them live longer.

Another condition that marijuana can help treat is glaucoma, a disease characterized by excessive fluid pressure within the eyeball. Glaucoma can cause severe eye and head pain and nausea and vomiting. Marijuana is good for treating these symptoms, but the reason marijuana is best for treating glaucoma is because it lowers intraocular pressure in the eyeball.

Marijuana has many other medicinal benefits as well. It helps reduce inflammation so if something is swollen, marijuana can help treat it as well as reduce the pain. It can be used to treat many more illnesses such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn&#39;s disease, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, the common cold, the flu, and many more. It also helps reduce stress.

Why is alcohol legal, and marijuana not? Alcohol is far more dangerous. http://www.saferchoice.org/content/view/24/53/

Lastly, who the hell thinks they have the right to tell me what I can or cannot do in my own home. 

This post is getting a little too long. So I&#39;ll finish it here, and reply to some of the posts. Please feel free to discuss anything about marijuana legalization.</description>

I voted yes for 1 reason. Half of the people that smoke marijuana right now, would quit if it were legalized. Why? Because they do it because there not suppose too. Sure if it were legalized everyone would do it for a short while, until it got old and everyone just got tired of the same old shit.<br>

<p>In Ireland, there are marches held annually for legalizing it, although the government doesn’t listen. You’ll find that many people also go to this as you can sometimes, if in the right place, get free marijuana.[/quote]</p>
<p>For the record, marijuana is not physically addictive like nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, etc. For some people, it can be mentally addicting. It’s addictive in the same way that TV or video games are. Gambling is also another mental addiction, so yes for some people that could be bad. Treat it with respect and use it in moderation and all is good. Quitting doesn’t really cause withdrawel symptoms, you just kinda miss it.</p>

<p>I think all tobacco laws should apply to it. But since it does get you intoxicated, all alcohol laws should apply as well. Theres no way of telling for sure, but I don’t think the use would suddenly increase. But from what the past shows us, marijuana use doesn’t increase in areas where it is more available or at least partly-legalized.

<p>No, I didn’t take it that way. I don’t mind people who smoke pot. I drive my friends around and sometimes they might have some on them, so yeah I do want it legalized for my sake lol.</p>

<p>Explain please? Population will remain the same, seeing as that in the past 6000 years of recorded marijuana use, no one has ever died from it. More crime? Yeah right. Our prisons are so over crowded with non-violent drug offenders, that we are forced to release rapists and muderers out early.</p>

<p>I’m not too concerned about health effects where there isn’t any public evidence of. I can’t find anything about craters developing in the lungs.</p>
<p>Also, using a vaporizer eliminates all the dangers of smoking. So does consuming it orally.</p>

<p>And I hope they wouldn’t add chemicals, and I don’t think they would but I’d be more concerned about using radioactive pesticides (such as they do on tobacco). In my country they do not add additives to cigarettes. However in countires that they do, they are adding artificial flavour and preservitives among other things. I don’t think weed needs this quite so much. It’s got such a strong unique smell/flavour, and lasts reletively long when stored right.</p>
<p>But best of all, you could grow it yourself if you didn’t like the government’s bud.</p>
