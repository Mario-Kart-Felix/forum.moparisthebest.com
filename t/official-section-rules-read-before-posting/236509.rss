    <title>Official section rules - read before posting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/official-section-rules-read-before-posting/236509</link>
    <description>This section has been lacking an official rule set for quite some time, and I&#39;ve been thinking about throwing one in, so here it is (Rog3r reminded me earlier to get to it :D):

There&#39;s going to be a new rule added, to settle the confusion, and to allow something new for once. Here they are:

1) [b]All re-released material must be accredited appropriately![/b] If you&#39;re going to re-release another members work, you must provide the appropriate credits on your thread. (See also rule 10)

2) [b]Do NOT post harmful content![/b] No viruses, malware, or spyware are allowed on this forum! If you are caught, be expecting a mute [i]at the least[/i]. Depending on the infection and previous offenses, you may or may not be punished with a permanent ban from these forums.

3) [b]Do NOT post scans for viruses and other malware.[/b] Firstly, when the topic creator posts his/her own scan, it shows that they&#39;re usually IS an infection in the download. Common sense there. Secondly, you should have your own scanner by now, and you could use that if you&#39;d really like. [i]But most importantly, virus scanners do not pick up harmful content in source code![/i] Java is also a binary language when compiled, and the scanner will usually not pick anything up when it scans over the compiled output.

4) [b]NEW RULE: NON-SERVER &amp; NON-CLIENT DOWNLOADS [u]ARE[/u] ALLOWED (e.g. tools)![/b] This has never been allowed before, but hey, we decided to give it a go. The tool posted must follow all rules and have an appropriate connection to RS2 private servers. If rules start to get broken and content gets out of hand, this rule will be revoked, and no longer will we allow non-server/non-client material to be posted.

5) [b]No Requests[/b] Rather straightforward - don&#39;t post a topic requesting a certain source download link to be given to you.  Use your resources such as the [i]search button[/i] to your advantage.  Doing so will result in a warning or moderation.  You can now use the appropriate requests board in order to request.

6) [b]No *.bat / list files PERIOD![/b] There are stupid and a waste of time to bother with. Learn to program with a real language. If you&#39;re beatiful server includes one of these in the topic itself (if its included in the download its okay) then it&#39;ll be locked and you&#39;ll be punished. Forgot to mention, they only work on Windows, too. Also lists aren&#39;t really a download as it is usually a text file with some scribbles in it. The official Moparscape client already has a list. USE IT!

7) [b]Don&#39;t post download lists![/b] These are a waste of your time.  If someone wants a source, they can use the search button.

8) [b]Having topic titles[/b] involving &quot;About to remove&quot; , &quot;Post or ill remove&quot;, or something similar will result in a lock and a warn/mute. Refer to [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,314359.0.html]this topic[/url] for complete details.

9) [b]Referral/or money making links are not allowed.[/b]If you&#39;re going to release something to this community then release it for free, and don&#39;t try to make money out of it. 

10) [b]The &quot;leeched&quot; concept.[/b] 
[quote=&quot;Thug-life, post:1, topic:213709&quot;]I&#39;ll add this to the rules after i feel its been taken to by the members. 

Well since you have all been ignoring or just not understanding it so i&#39;ll make it clear here. Whenever you post a server or a client with the source code included you agree to the fact [b]other people can use it.[/b] If you don&#39;t want people &quot;Leeching&quot; your work then you do [b]not[/b] release it, simple as. 

Even still, most of you are using wL based servers and have no right in claiming that as your own, same with jagex&#39;s client. You however can credit yourself for whatever code you have added and if the code you have added is someone elses then you credit them either in the topic and in comments in the source code. 

Basically: 
[quote author=Moparisthebest link=topic=280328.msg2283200#msg2283200 date=1213786297]
Just make them all credit winterlove and daiki...
[/quote]
I&#39;ll add, credit Jagex and if you have used anyone elses code they have released and you have added that code to the client or the server credit them too.

I&#39;ll give this a day or two for people to notice this sticky before i start full on enforcing the rules and handing out punishments to those who break it, there will be no exceptions, you can recieve anything from a warn to mute depending on what you post. If you do find someone releasing a server or a client with someone elses code who is not credited them please just ask them nicely to credit that person, if they do not after you asking them to then report that person and a member of staff will take it from there. 

[b][size=13pt]Percentages[/size][/b]:
Just name the people you are crediting, don&#39;t bother making up random percentages unless you can provide the equations on how you get these percentages.
[quote author=Projext link=topic=281254.msg2288368#msg2288368 date=1214022332]
So like instead of going
[code]10% credit to you
and 90% credits to me![/code]

Make like a list of all the people who helped and contributed into your productions and end results which are out for release

EG:
[code]Thug-Life
Projext
_Reforced
More Names[/code]

And don&#39;t forget anyone ;)
[/quote]

@Moderators, Admins etc: If i have missed anything or feel this needs to be changed, feel free to contact me on irc.

Plus, i don&#39;t need any &#39;Thanks good rule&#39; type posts, don&#39;t post if you don&#39;t have anything constructive to say.[/quote]

Forum global rules are still in effect in this section, so read up on those as well! I&#39;ll leave this open for now, to see your input. If things get out of hand, harsher rules will be set and this topic will be closed for discussion.</description>

              <p>Hey tico, you might want to add something about outrageously long topic titles (the ones that jack up the spacing).  I mean really, I can’t be the only one here who thinks //////@@@@@@@@@@<span class="mention">@DIPSHITSCAPE</span>@@@@@@@@@@@//////\ looks like shit…  And I don’t think we need the whole “200+ downloads!” or “is finally out!”.  All we really need is the topic name, and if its a source or client.</p>
