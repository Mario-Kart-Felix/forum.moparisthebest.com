    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/voting-for-cash/371366</link>
    <description>Okay, i tried the tutorials, re-did everyone about 5 times, not even joking, wasted about 5-6 hours of my life... But yet, i can&#39;t get it working, i want a voting system like alot of popular servers hate, were they vote and recieve 50m cash, If anyone could do this for me over teamviewer it would be greatly appreciated!!!!!!

And i would love you forever,
Kthxbai!
