    <description>[u][b]What Is Earthscape?[/b][/u]
Earthscape is a project i started a while ago, while i had just begun coding runescape private servers.
It is a balanced source, with great pking, and also a manageable economy.
I was aiming for something that looked earth-like, hence the home in Version one, the training in version 1 and 2, and the pk area, which has been maintained through all 3 versions released so far.
It has a unique way of runecrafting, which i have totally integrated into the source, it seems as tho it was a part of the runescape we now emulate.

[u][b]What Is So Great About Earthscape?[/b][/u]
Earthscape isn&#39;t one of those server like deltascape, which will become immensely famous, as i only use it to test certain codes.


[b][u]Look Be low for A guide as to what i have completed, what i have begun, and what is incomplete.[/u][/b]
