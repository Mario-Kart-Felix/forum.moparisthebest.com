    <title>Need base client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-base-client/340211</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to get better at coding and get more into it. I got a base server that was recommended by one of the moderators. Does anyone have any base clients that I could use to begin coding. I&#39;m looking for something that would be fairly decent for a beginner-intermediate coder. If you could please give me a link or even just a name I would be very grateful. THANKS!!! :D</description>
