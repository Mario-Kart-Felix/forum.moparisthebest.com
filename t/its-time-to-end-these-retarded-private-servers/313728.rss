    <description>Runescape Classic is back. They have opened regs for two weeks, meaning anyone willing to buy a membership will be able to play again like it use to be, yes even your old characters with those &quot;awesome&quot; stats. Now doubtful about this? Don&#39;t be:

-Why else do you think people turned to Private servers in the first place? Because they wanted another chance to play the REAL thing. Enough with poorly written sources with random shit added to it. You will never see another RSCD or Stork PK come back unless the creators themselves re-release it.

-You&#39;ve seen the amount of DDoS that&#39;s increased over time, because of jealousy or hatred on owners. Jagex won&#39;t go down...

-Hosts of the servers vs Jagex: I mean really, Jagex isn&#39;t that bad compared to some of the idiots running these servers. No more teenagers with too much free time controlling your game play.

-Training: RSCA will always have the possibility of shutting down, Jagex won&#39;t because they will always need more profit, even if it means bringing back the game the day tried so hard to let go. Train your stats, and know they&#39;ll be there in x amount of years.

-Botting: With the new servers being released, came a new client, and the need for more bots developed. 

Point is; Those who came here wanting to play RSC have another chance, don&#39;t waste your time any longer with these shit servers.

PS: Mods PM me before closing/deleting please.</description>

<p>All i found was loader, and strange thing is , i can’t find the real client anywhere. and they implemented some new features to game too:<br>
-Right click report abuse<br>
-Chat censors updated.<br>
-New report abuse button<br>
-Right click offer on trade, and stake(You can still use the old school style of offering cash, also offer x,offer all etc)<br>
-Sell X, Sell All ,Buy X, and other options on shops.<br>
-The messages go up to half of the screen.<br>
-You can now do different color combination’s such as: ‘<a class="mention" href="/u/red">@red</a>@HI <a class="mention" href="/u/cya">@cya</a>@There <a class="mention" href="/u/mag">@mag</a>@dude!’ in the chat.</p>
<p>That’s all i’ve noticed so far.<br>
[/quote]With the real client you could always do that, it’s fucked up in the RSCD client and I’m assuming it’s because the bad removal of the chat filter.<br>

I found them ages ago and it was like that on real rsc, if you meant the color combination, u couldn’t use different colors in the chat, I remember it very clearly when I tried to do all colors in 1 text it showed 1 color and rest was <a class="mention" href="/u/col">@col</a>@.</p>
