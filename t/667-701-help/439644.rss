    <description>Hello mates, am using Disturbed v2, and I have some doubts:

How can I spawn and Edit an NPC. Ex. I go to barbarian village and I attack them and they have 1 hp.

Dungeoneering, how does it work? You get to the boss, kill it, but when you try use the leader to leave nothing happens.


And does anybody knows how to make dungeoneering work?

Thanks, I appriciate some help.</description>
