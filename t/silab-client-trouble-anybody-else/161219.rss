    <title>Silab Client Trouble, Anybody else?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/silab-client-trouble-anybody-else/161219</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve heard a lot of people with complaints about the SilabSoft client V.4 But as im being sieving through these forums, i havnt seen one person, with the same problem i have, so i was wondering if somebody could help me out. Well ive tried logging in with a couple of  peoples servers, that have SilabSoft compatible servers to so they speak, but when i log in, for example i earned a prayer skillcape. I ended up Getting a useless book
that was of absolute no use to me. Has anybody else had this problem, and solved it? if so, Could you please, tell me How to solve the problem because im so desprate to play Silabs Client again cause it plainly just owns :) So could somebody help, if it seems easier to explain on MSN My address for it is... george_brooksy@hotmail.com, im usually online. 


Thanks for Reading</description>
