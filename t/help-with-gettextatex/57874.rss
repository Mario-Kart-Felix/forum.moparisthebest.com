    <title>Help With GetTextAtEx</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-gettextatex/57874</link>
    <description>Ok so I&#39;m writing my own little scripter thingy to buy things in bulk, and i&#39;ve got it all working now except for this little stumper:

ESS:=StrToInt(GetTextAtEx(326,72,130,Trade1Chars,false,false,0,10,6619135,25,false,tr_Digits))

I need it to find the amount that the other player has offered, after that everything is perfect but this just doesn&#39;t seem to work, I run the script and it goes until someone trades, then it opens up the trade and then the person offers and then it stops so i check the debug box and I get this:

Successfully compiled
[Runtime Error] : Exception: &#39;                         &#39; is not a valid integer value in line 30 in script C:\Users\******\Desktop\******\Scar\SCAR 2.03\Scripts\BulkBuyer.scar

(Line 30 in the script is the GetTextAtEx part, I&#39;m not that blunt)

(The &#39; * &#39; in the path is what I put in to block names)

Anyone?</description>

              <p>I don’t know how to do the x.y coords though because they will always change depending on the number it is, because a 1 is more skinny than a 7, its meant to read how many essence the other person has offered, and in the trade manu the numbers are alligned to the right so i dunno wat to do lol, is there a GetTextIn function? cuz that would be awesome where you give all the parameters in gettextatex with x,y begin var, and has sx,sy,ax,ay or sumthin like that[br][size=1]Posted on: February 13, 2007, 04:05:14 PM[/size][hr]anybody else know?</p>

              <p>[quote=“deathbyvirus, post:3, topic:57874”]does the coords of x,y have to be exact?[/quote]Yes. At first it might feel pretty hard to get the correct coordinates, but you’ll get used to it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Just make somekind of script that detects and adds everytime 1 to x or y, until it finds the text, as it will be much faster than actually changing the coordinates yourself. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
