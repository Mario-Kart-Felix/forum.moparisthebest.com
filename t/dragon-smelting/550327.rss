    <title>Dragon Smelting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dragon-smelting/550327</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m to the point where I have Dragon ore/Bars in my server but the functionality isnt all there. As far as smelting goes I have set it to where you click on the mith bar and it smelts the dragon. How can I add Dragon to the end instead of replacing one? and if I have to replace one, how can I edit the picture/Menu?

              <p>[quote=“Zymus, post:3, topic:550327”]The other option is, if you don’t (want|know how) to use the interface editor, you could change it so that you have to use the dragon ore on the furnace in order to get it, instead of clicking on the furnace. Or you could have a special Npc that does all the smelting (maybe he’s the only one that still knows how, and he’s not giving up his secrets). Talk to him, convince him to do it (maybe charge a fee), see him walk into his house, fade the screen to black, fade back with him outside the house, start dialogue with him saying it’s all done, add items to inventory. Doing it this way you could also make a quest chain if you want (save him from a dragon cult, he helps you smith it, but won’t tell his secret, next time you come to him he gets kidnapped by the dragon cult again and sacrificed to KBD or something).[/quote]  very creative, I like it but I’ll most likely make a new interface for this in particular.   Thanks both of you</p>
<p>[quote author=sk8rdude461 link=topic=669238.msg4475205#msg4475205 date=1425413049]<br>
You would have to edit the interface (I’d suggest something like lins interface editor).<br>
I <span class="bbcode-i">believe</span> all the items you see will have a separate item container visible on the editor, and you can then move them over, along with the text.<br>
Then you would have to make another one for the dragon ore.</p>
<p>How can I set it so you can click on the ore first then the furnace?</p>
