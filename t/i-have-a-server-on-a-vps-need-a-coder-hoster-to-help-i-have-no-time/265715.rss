listen up. im not some little punk kid. im 27 yrs old.and i will also be codeing myself i just cant do it all.I pay for the danm website and for the vps.So yea I do contribute alot to the server.And as i siad im not looking for someone to do all the work theres just times i cant get to something that someone might suggest to do or if mods/admins need help and the only way to help is to edite the server in some way through the vps which mods and admins cant connect to.So no im not looking to just hand over all the work and take credit for it.I just need some frigin help at times when its to much to do for me.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Ok I aint no punk kid bro, im 22[/quote]<br>
Umm?</p>
<p>Age: 25</p>
<p>In your profile?</p>
<p>And yeah you’re also right. If you need someone to code and host a server for you, what are you going to do? Sit around and whatever tell everyone your owner, why the hell would someone host a server for you to be owner on and them to be Administrator or Co-Owner.</p>
<p>By the way, you got a VPS but you need a hoster?</p>
