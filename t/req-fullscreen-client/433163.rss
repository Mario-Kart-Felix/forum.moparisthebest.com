    <title>[req] fullscreen client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-fullscreen-client/433163</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

I am trying to make my client fullscreen but Im having a little but of trouble. I was able to edit the frame size and the actual game size but I can&#39;t figure out how to:

1. move the chatarea, maparea, and inventory so that it is not in the middle of the screen
2. able to make the whole frame clickable (for example even though the game screen takes up the entire client frame, the area outside of the chatarea/maparea/inventory I am not able to click there and move there. It is almost as if I can only see more of the area around me without actually being able to move there.)

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks</description>
