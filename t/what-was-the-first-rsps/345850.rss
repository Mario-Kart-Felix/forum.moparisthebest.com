<p>Hi n10si t, could you please shut your mouth, because the word ‘asshole’ is quite complimenting, but you are not using that as an insult, you are simply telling me not to. Tell me, do i look like your little brother who you usually molest at night? I am your mother so treat me with some respect you incoherent prepubescent mongoloid fuck.</p>

<p>Everyone can say they have the original. Its just 3 classes that almost all servers share. The only servers that don’t have it are the ones that rewrite the Cryption and Stream classes.</p>

<p>Wl (WinterLove) - only released 1 server, it was the original server and only one made at the time. It was basically the Cryption, Stream, Server classes. You could log in and just run around that’s it you didn’t see your self but the items on the ground.</p>
<p>BlakeScape was the first server to be released with the basic features like walking, multi player, rendering, etc.</p>
