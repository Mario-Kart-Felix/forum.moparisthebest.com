    <title>Help with Allstar-scape source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-allstar-scape-source/290372</link>
    <description>I was using the Rs2hd source with some 508 client i downloaded and every thing worked fine, and still does. but then i noticed that there where hardly any tuts for it, so i decided to download the Allstar-scape V2 source because there are a bunch of tuts for that kind of source. When i loaded the allstar server up, it said &quot;Online!&quot;, so then i noticed that the only clients that &quot;worked&quot; for it where the silab one, and my custom one, by &quot;worked&quot; i mean i at least seen some response from the command prompt. All the other types of clients gave me the &quot;error_game.js5connect&quot; error. And that&#39;s why im here to ask someone to help me figure out what is wrong because this is what the command prompt had to say:
[code]Connection accepted from MACHINE: 2805.
Client type: high memory version

              <p>its because allstar-scape is a 317 base, you can only run it with a 317  client, if you don’t, that is what will happen. if it is not ONLINE and that is that you are talking about, PM me and i will help you.</p>

<p>You are also missing the moreinfo char file and connectfrom folders judging by this error,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Admin: error writing file.</code></pre>
<p>I recommend downloading my reapage scape with thread fix server (Located in the link in my siggy)</p>
<p>This is basically the same source except with more features and I have added the thread fix which stops spammers nulls etc. (Also reduces lag  :eek:)</p>
