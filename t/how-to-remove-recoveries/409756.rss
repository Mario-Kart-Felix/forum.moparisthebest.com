    <title>How to remove recoveries</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-remove-recoveries/409756</link>
    <description>Hi. It seems that Jagex has made it nearly impossible to completely remove recoveries from accounts which already have them - or so I thought. Here&#39;s a nifty guide:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Requirements:
- You must have enough information to recover your account.
- Setting your e-mail will help with this process.
- Information that really helps: IP and Date created, as well as ISP created on. First passwords, any sort of membership on the account, and past recovery questions will help you with this process.

1) On the runescape main page hover over &quot;Account&quot;, and select &quot;Account Management.

2) While in &quot;Account Management&quot;, select &quot;Recover Your Account.&quot;

3) If you have an e-mail set, Jagex may OR may not send you an e-mail containing a link to automatically change your password.. If not, you&#39;ll have to enter a recovery appeal. Once you&#39;ve made one, check the e-mail you provided to Jagex to recover your account. Once you receive the e-mail, open the e-mail to set your new password. Enter your login name, and [COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;][B]STOP[/B][/COLOR] here. Now close this window.

4) Repeat steps 1-2. Submit another recovery for your account. This time, the e-mail should say &quot;Locked Account Recovery request submitted for your Jagex account&quot;

5) If Jagex didn&#39;t make you submit an appeal to recover your account, click the link provided to change your password to your locked account. Your recoveries are now taken off. 

If Jagex e-mailed you a link to submit an appeal to recover your account, you&#39;ll need to simply re-appeal once more. Once complete, Jagex will then e-mail you a link to change your password to your locked account. Your recoveries are now taken off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Enjoy :)</description>
