    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m new here. This is my first post. I&#39;m active on a couple other forums but came here in need of help. I am trying to code a server just for the experience. Maybe one day it&#39;ll be put online. But I&#39;m not a coding master or anywhere near it. I know a lot of basic things from different threads I found when googling something. I need someone that&#39;s able to tutor me on how to code. I have looked at different online sources on how to code and I&#39;ve learned some stuff from them but it&#39;s hard for me to learn that way. I learn best with hand on activities. I have a blank 317 source already. I&#39;ve added a lot of things to it all hand coded, not from tuts or snippets. I look at them to get ideas then try to do it myself from there. I&#39;ve had help but that person has been busy with his job for about 2 weeks now so I haven&#39;t done much since then. I&#39;m available in the mornings (I live in eastern USA; -5:00) and most of the days on the weekends. If you want to help me, pm me your Skype and I&#39;ll add you. Thanks in advance.</description>

<p>sorry sk8r, this is my first post. how do i move it to the correct section? also, i have seen and learned from many java tuts. they all seem to just be coding stuff in a console which is different than in a server.[/quote]<br>
They’re different, but it’s still good to use them. They teach you how to use the different classes of Java and etc. Which you can then apply into your server.</p>
<p>For instance, if you learn how to use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Calendar class</a> then you would be able to apply that knowledge to create something like <a href="http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/google/tutorials/267319-automatic-double-exp-weekend-project-insanity.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Automatic double exp weekend’s</a>.</p>
<p>Also, there is no way to move topics without being a staff member of the forums, you can report the topic and when it’s reviewed they will move it to the section that’s most if (If applicable).</p>

<p>This section is intended to give people help on a specific error(s) or for them to get help doing something they don’t know how to.</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading java docs and tutorials, as that’s the language RSPS is wrote in. The tutorials wrote by oracle can be found <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. Others can be simply found by googling <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Java+tutorials" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Java tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>It’s all up to you what you choose to start with, no need to justify yourself. And I don’t know what you mean that 317’s have a lot more dupes and bugs? These are factors of how to code was written, of course if the source got written terrible then it ends up like PI having a ton of bugs, but if it’s well written it’s the opposite then, it’d run flawless. Of course, there are always bugs in common. Conclusion: the better you write the code the better will be the stability and the better the maintainability, but there are always bugs. : -)<br>
We can continue talking via PM, I think problem is solved?</p>

I have made a lot of mistakes so far lol. i used to copy and paste tuts but all of them gave me a lot of errors i didnt know how to fix and so i started to learn the language. i know most of the basics now. I took a college course in java and found some good youtube videos that teaches it but its hard for me to convert (i guess) everything from what i learned there to the rsps bc everything i learned hasnt been done for a server so one of the first things i found is that to make the program send a message, you have to do System.out.println(""); but for my server i do c.sendMessage("");. theres been a few other things that i found thats different in the server than in the other thing.<br>
I have some knowledge of the language. My hardest thing is learning from videos and books lol. I need that interaction and someone to tell me yes u did it or no thats not right or theres a better way to do it. I have looked at a lot of different tuts on java and i learned a lot of stuff from them but its different to make a game than the tuts ive seen.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>My advice for you would be that you start off with a base with much content rather than a clean one, since you can always look at the content packed source to see how things are being handled and may re-write it. (I think you mentioned that already).</p>
<p>With re-writing I mean trying to create different code but the same output.</p>
<p>I gotta agree with Welliton, you should start off with a 317 to get used to the protocol. If you’re a fast learner, go for higher revisions between 500 and 742. If it’s the case that you want to go for higher revisions, drop me a message so I can supply you with further information.</p>
<p>PS: Make sure you’re using an IDE.</p>

              <p>Java is your tutor. I honestly suggest if you’re new to this, the base that you chosen you play around with it. I also suggest that you stick to a 317 as your starting base.</p>
<p>You will make many mistakes but it is all a learning process. I was like you once, I went straight into RSPS development without any sort of knowledge in Java. I made hundreds of mistakes at my first go, but I learnt so much from these mistakes and it made me want to actually learn what it was I was doing wrong/what the piece of code meant. That is where I decided I wanted to learn about the language of Java.</p>
<p>I wish you the best of luck on your future RSPS development.</p>
