    <title>Hi!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hi/270267</link>
    <description>I did not see a section for this so please do not flame me (Mods please move this topic is there is). Well about me, I have played RSC since 1999 and just quit RS2 becasue I finally got fed up with Jagex. Came here to start work on a RSC Server. Not planing on it to be anything special more of a learning experience for my programming (I know no java what so ever, (C++ FTW :) ) ). So yeah hi hope I have good times on here. Was here a few years back but was sick of tired of all the useless flaming from stupid members.

Edit:Question: Are the two forums linked? The server development one and this one in terms of rep, posts and such?</description>

<p>Sheepy, if you’re looking into RSC private server development, then <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php#20" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php#20</a> is what you’re looking for.  The two forums are linked when it comes to profile information, with the sole exception of reputation points, which are earned separately on both sites.</p>
