Not very often. If this happens only once out of a vast amount of people, its the person, not the game.</p>

              <p>It disgusts me when people blame video games for violence.</p>
<p>They’re simply taking the responsibility of the crime away from the fucked up individual. Any reasonable (not-fucked-up) person has no problem discerning video games from reality. The problem is the kid, not the games he plays. I’ve played GTAIII, GTA Vice City, GTA San Andreas, and GTAIV since I was like 10 years old, and I haven’t killed anyone.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yeah, if you read that kids quotes, he’s clearly fucking insane.</p>

<p>But this part:</p>
<blockquote>In October, attorney and activist Jack Thompson filed a $246 million lawsuit against Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc., GTA III designers Take-Two Interactive Software and Rockstar Games, and Wal-Mart, in connection with a Tennessee case in which two teenage stepbrothers killed one person and injured another by shooting rifles at passing motorists, the Scene reported. The teens claimed GTA III as inspiration.
<p>“I think the video game industry is about as evil as any entity in America is,” Thompson told the paper. “I’m out to take their money from them – and it’s blood money, in some of these instances – and give it to the people who have been harmed by them.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We are on a crusade,” he told the paper. “We’d like to see everybody who has one of the [games] turn them in, like they do with rifles and pistols. We want to put them out of business.”</p>

<p>Many adults believe that violence in video games makes kids change. They say that if you kill people on a video game, you are less likely to feel the wrong in killing people in reality. Exactly as the article says, GTA is a common one.</p>
