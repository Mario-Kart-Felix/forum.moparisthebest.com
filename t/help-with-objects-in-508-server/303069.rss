    <title>Help with objects in 508 server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-objects-in-508-server/303069</link>
    <description>Hey everyone... i recently added a few objects into my source. The coding aspects were all fine but when you log on they aren&#39;t there until one of the admins types ::object 1 or any other object number
is there a way i could make it so they are always there? i never had this problem with 317 but im fairly new to 508&#39;s
also im having some problems getting my server to save a player&#39;s height when they logout.</description>
