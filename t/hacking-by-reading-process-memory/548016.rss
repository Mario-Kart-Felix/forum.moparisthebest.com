    <description>Hello!
I am playing a game called [b]League of Legends[/b].

What I&#39;d like to do is to create a GUI, that, while I am playing the game,
can automatically find the process and read DATA from it to analyze the situation of the game
and display tips to what would be wise to do to increase the chance to win.

It shall [b]NOT[/b] interact with the client by &quot;boting&quot; or auto-aiming/play the game for me.
I, the player shall do all input to the game manually. As I said, the program should only read.

It&#39;s the hijacking-part that I&#39;m not sure how I should solve. Once the program can read and understand the information,
I think I should be able to create the GUI and develop the rest of the program by myself.

Since I allready know which application it should interact with, the program shall be specified to only this program.

I&#39;m not entirely sure if this has been answered before, or how legit this is as it is ONLY giving hints, 
but something tells me that this is not 100% clean. :P

I&#39;m looking for suggestions about which language I should develop this in,
and if you know of any good tutorials out there teaching this.
I&#39;m most used to Java-programming.

Have a nice day.  :cool:</description>

<p>Why? It’s trivial. On Windows, it will require that your ‘reader’ process has SeDebugPrivilege, but that only requires administrator/elevatable user with a UAC prompt - Steam does this and nobody minds when it does it, so they’ll presumably be OK with your bot/helper doing it.</p>
<p>EDIT: If you want to post more info on exactly what data you want from the client and what kind of hints you want, I might be convinced to help you get the data out. I’ve worked with LoL a bit before.</p>

              <p>Yes, this would be against the TOS of course. Just because it isnt making actions for you doesn’t mean it’s clean <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Also, reading memory isnt the same as interpreting memory. The reading part is fairly easy, something like cheat engine does it very simply. What it doesnt do is tell you what the memory addresses are for, what they mean, etc, and unless you find that information this is going to be a lot harder than you may think.</p>

              <p>To extend on to Bowser jr’s suggestion on using C/C++ using the Windows API, the steps look sort of like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Since the process ID of the game won’t be constant, you can enumerate through your processes until you find the LoL process. You call CreateToolhelp32Snapshot() to create a snapshot of your current processes and enumerate through them using Process32First() and Process32Next(). An example can be found <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/windows/desktop/ms686701%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. The important part here is how they get access to each process’ name and ID. Save the process ID for the next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use OpenProcess() to get a handle to the LoL process; just pass the process ID and the kind of access you want to the process (read, write, etc.). You can see an example using OpenProcess() in the above example. You might need to enable a sort of “debugging” privilege to do this but I can’t remember this step very well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally to read the memory of the process you can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/windows/desktop/ms680553%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ReadProcessMemory()</a> to read the contents of LoL’s memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t forget to close all handles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry if this isn’t very specific, the Windows API requires alot of intermediate steps to get this right. :s</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Using C++ (I’m sure you can use other non-VM languages to, but I’ve only done it in C++) you can read the memory area of other programs. Everything you need should be available with <span class="hashtag">#include</span> . However to get the values you need I would recommend using Cheat Engine since it is a bit tricky to find what you need on your own. Once you get the memory address and a way to get them, since the location change every the the game starts, you can use it for what you want to do.</p>
<p>Since you’re most used to Java, I’m sure there you be some simple way of transferring the info from a simple C++ to a Java app that actually uses the information. Sockets are the first thing that comes to my mind, but I’m sure there is other alternatives.</p>
<p>You should however note that LoL might think you’re cheating (It might be looking for cheating programs like Cheat Engine), so do not do use that program with your real account.</p>
