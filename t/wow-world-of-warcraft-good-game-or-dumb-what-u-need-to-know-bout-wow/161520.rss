It’s good.  Although, apprently it’s the worst game to become addicted to.  I’ve seen alot of videos on YouTube of recovering addicts who regret wasting alot of time playing World of Warcraft.  That isn’t to say you could use your time carefully and wisely though, spending around 1 hour a day or so on the actual game itself as a pose to 5 or 6.<br>

<p>I’m starting to think my brother has the same problem too. Although he only gets to play around once a week because he doesn’t have his own computer, I think he’s very much addicted to the game. I believe it has its part in helping my brother drop out of school, because he got into a fight with my mom once about his future and education and he was talking about that all he needed in his life was WoW and he’ll be set. Thankfully he isn’t so crazy about the game as he used to be, but I still see some faults about him playing the game.</p>

<p>I’d recommend trying the 10 day free trial on <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.worldofwarcraft.com</a> or <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.wow-europe.com</a> .</p>
<p>You can’t possibly experience 1/10 the fun in a 10 day trial but it is definitely worth a try.</p>

<p>I think the game is some what cool, but I do think it is beatin’ by Final Fantasy (sorry, but BEST RPG EVER). And I also like RuneScape better than WoW. I only play it on some of my free time. Other than that I usually would play CS, TF2, Halo 3, or RS2 with my free time.</p>
<p>I’m thinking of trying out Hellgate London. It looks like a kickass game.</p>
