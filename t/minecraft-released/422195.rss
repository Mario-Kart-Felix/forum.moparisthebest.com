    <description>Let the Autism ensue.

I&#39;ve had it ever since the alpha, and honestly, it&#39;s kind of a game that you play nonstop the first month, and after that you don&#39;t play until an update comes out. The experience gets stale after around three months when you&#39;ve done pretty much everything -- once you had diamond, it&#39;s pretty much nothing from there.

Notch has added The End, Endermen are scary as shit now, and now there&#39;s boss battles.

What about you lot? What do you all think?

Also, a day in the life of Notch:
