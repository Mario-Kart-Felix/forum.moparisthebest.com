    <title>| [REQUEST] 600/700+ Server, Client, Cache Package |</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-600-700-server-client-cache-package/545077</link>
    <description>Hello,

After a short year or 2 away from the RSPS community, a friend and I have decided to start a new project this year. We are the owners of the previously hit RSPS &#39;Overloadx&#39;. My name is Josh and my friends name is Richie. We&#39;ve decided to bring our minds together and start on a new project. We&#39;re looking for a 600/700+ source, client, and cache package. Our goal is to start fresh with either a blank or a clean 600/700+ server, and add our old Ovlx odds and ends as we go. We don&#39;t want to do a lot of skill/glitch fixing. We just want to start with a clean source that already has most of the kinks worked out that our previous 317 did not have. I&#39;m asking for either a link to a release that you think might be helpful or maybe something you personally own and would be willing to only give out to 2 experienced coders. A lot of what is listed below can be coded by myself and Richie, but we&#39;d rather start with a clean fixed source and add the harder things that only Overloadx had before. Thanks to all who chooses to help me out! 

Needs:
Old Interface (not the updated RS 2013+ interfaces, the 2011-2012 interfaces)
I would like pretty much every skill to be fully coded and working properly. Dungeoneering isn&#39;t too big of a deal to me but I would like the other skills to be fully integrated.)
No dupes
No major glitches
Duel Arena
All 90-100% working bosses (I.e QBD, TD, KQ, NEX...)
All 100% coded spell books
All 100% coded prayer books
New Graphics but as I stated above; older interfaces




Wants:
Basically 2012 Runescape :D
Multiple World Inegration
Control Panel
Compiler that updates without restarting server (I have this somewhere but I seem to have misplaced it.)


Thank you for your time.</description>
