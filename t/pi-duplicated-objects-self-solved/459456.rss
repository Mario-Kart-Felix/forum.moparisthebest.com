    <title>[PI]- Duplicated Objects. *SELF-Solved*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-duplicated-objects-self-solved/459456</link>
    <description>Alright I am trying to create an agility course.. But I have 3 rows of almost the same objects.. How do I solve this problem so that when I click on the 2nd row of them it takes me to a different XY Pos, instead of where the first row takes me?

Any help is appreciated.
*Please help fast.

EDIT: I just deleted the dupped objects and added:
[code]c.absY +2;
c.absX +1;[/code]</description>
