    <title>Adding custom Frames (Emotes) into a client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-custom-frames-emotes-into-a-client/296829</link>
    <description>i was just wondering.. Say if i have a custom emote and i wanted to add more into my client,
do i have to replace the code in client.class?

And for the class20.java bit, i dont get it rofl, how the hell am i supposed to know the IDs of the frames, cuz i really want to add my custom emote in my client, but i dont want my client to only read the emote i was going to add, Basicly i just want to know how to Create a Emote vis class20.java, i get some of it but the Frame ID part i dont get it, can some1 explain to me?

btw this isnt a TUt or anything, this is just for me to know in future, how to add custom Emotes into your client, ive looked every where on a TuT but they are all Greedy, they dont tell you how to add them.</description>
