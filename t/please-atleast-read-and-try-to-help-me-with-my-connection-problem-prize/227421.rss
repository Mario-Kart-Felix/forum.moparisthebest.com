              <p>maybe your ip is broken? you should update on the no-ip wesite. delete your host and make a new one. (can still be the same name) and when your on DUC no-ip make sure the smileys are grinning big or blushing, and it can also be that you havent set your environment variables.</p>
<p>Hope This Helped.</p>
