    <title>Any Site Editing.. (Need to know Html and other languages)</title>

    <description>[b]Note: Mods, you can delete this if it is not needed. :)[/b]

Well, as most of you know, you can &#39;Right Click &gt; Veiw Source&#39;

Then you can take that scripting and edit and delete parts.

What I do, I get the source, take parts out that I don&#39;t want. 

Get a freeweb&#39;s site, then upload the scripting from there. 

Then I click on the file from the Freeweb&#39;s Admin Panel. (Whatever you guys call it)

Please keep the flaming down in this, I don&#39;t want to have a bad start of my Mopar life.</description>
