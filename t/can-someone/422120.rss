    <title>Can Someone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone/422120</link>
    <description>K, so i read over the rules and i didn&#39;t see anything that said i wasn&#39;t allowed to ask this.. ( I just scammed through the thread ).

Im going to start playing RS again, and i feel like making a pure.

Does anybody have like a low level range account that they can give me? I dont feel like going through all the tutorials.

Sooo, just anybody with a low level ranger and no other stats ( Maybe strength or attack but no defense ).

Thanks if you can give me one..

Sorry if this isnt allowed.</description>
