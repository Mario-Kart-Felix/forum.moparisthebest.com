    <title>Help with xp levels</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-xp-levels/261753</link>
    <description>Hey, my server has different xp until a level up than runescape I was wondering if you could tell me how to change it to the same as runescape.


(not very good at explaining soo.. for level 27 in any skill on runescape you need 9730 xp but on my server you need less xp for level 27, how can I change it so that it is the same as runescape?)</description>

              <p>You can change it in your client.java - here is an example.</p>
<pre><code>	lastAction = now;
	sendMessage("You pickpocket the farmer.");
	addItem(995, misc.random(25));
	addSkillXP(800, 17);
</code></pre>
<p>See where it says addSkillXP - Change that to the exp rate you want. You can do this for any other skill as well.</p>
