    <description>ok, first to clear something up, im using deltascape base
1. When i try using the spec of dragon claws on other players, i disconnect, why does this happen?(works fine on npcs however!)
2. How do i make a multi combat zone? (i know how the code goes, but could someone explain it to me? i dont understand how to make a certain area multi combat)
3. There is this one npc that i cant attack, how would i make it attackable? (it has the attack option, just doesnt attack when you click on it)
4. how can i make it so you dont loose anything anywere other than in the wild
5. when an aggressive npc trys to attack someone, they just walk through objects, how can i prevent this? (basically noclips through the object)
6. i followed this tutorial: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,457701.msg3349622.html#msg3349622
it worked for the abyssal demon monster, but it does not work for otheer npcs (abyssal guardian, abyssal walker, zombies..) what is wrong? i went over the tutorial 5 times...
how can i solve these?</description>
