    <title>Project Rainbow?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-rainbow/543407</link>
    <description>Hello,

Does anybody have the Project Rainbow source and client? (Please dont say rip it from them or something like this, I have no idea how and i just want to have the normal client and source for quick and fast use)
Every link that i could find was broken!
I want to have it for personal experimentation.
Been looking everywhere ...! :palm:

Well anyways appreciation and many thanks who has this for me!  :)
