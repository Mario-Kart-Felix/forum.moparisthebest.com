<p>Finite resources would lead to long-term problems.</p>
<p>If you take a macroeconomic look at a game economy, you will see the same fundamental flaws in almost all major rpg games. There’s a classic issue of superinflation. Resources are unlimited, therefore, all the items that can be produced (including gold in terms of monster drops, alchemy, and selling to stores) are also unlimited. In a real economy, you can regulate the cash flow using monetary policy, such as shredding old bills or selling bonds. Games don’t have good solutions like this, so you have to try another approach. Money sinks are a good way to try and reduce the hyperinflation of gold, but they don’t solve the issues of items. Items are unlimited so long as resources are. You could use finite resources like s1gma suggested, but then eventually your player base will completely dry out a world and it won’t be fun anymore. You could scale resources relative to the number of players, but isn’t trivial. The best solution in my opinion would be to have degrading armors. All armors eventually need to be repaired or will break (and therefore, need to be replaced). Doing this properly will allow for resources to always be demanded and, because armor is a pure loss of money, will also aid in balancing the amount of currency in the game.</p>
<p>Properly balancing the above can get very tricky. I won’t leave speljohan out of this, though! There are ways of avoiding the problem altogether, such as removing currency. If people are trading items for items, then the supply and demand is based on need and desire. It will take a lot longer for an economy to super inflate without a currency fueling it. It would still help to use degraded armors or conditionally finite resources, but those wouldn’t impact the game play as much in this scenario.</p>

Like I said, it all depends on how much gold is in actual circulation, that’s why some economies on many servers are fucking shit, they say “dclaws are 400m” when there’s not even 100 in circulation.</p>

<p>My point is you shouldn’t be able to get that much money. These weren’t added to RuneScape because it shouldn’t be possible. The main problem with server economy are dupes and donations. Fix all your dupes… and donations need to be handled in ways where you cannot gain an unfair advantage over another player, but still make donating worth while. And also rare drops should actually be RARE.[/quote]</p>
<p>Everything said in this quote is correct. Also, you want to make it so that skills interweave with each other and connect. If you have a good economy, then there’s going to be a ‘system’ in place.</p>
