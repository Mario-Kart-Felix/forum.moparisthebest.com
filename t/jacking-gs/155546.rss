    <description>Has anybody ever been robbed by a &quot;g&quot;. Im not talking about Poor guys, im talking about those RIch kids the ones who think there &quot;g&quot; and get there mommies and daddies to buy them lexuses. I have been jumped by them SEVERAL times. Once at a mall when i was 13, he wanted a cell phone i did not have, and the result was him hitting me in the mall, running away, me going outside, him coming back, hits me to the ground, stomps on me until some guys come and get him off. Anotehr time i was in school with a smoke i was going outside for it and this guy comes up to me OBVISOLY RICH had a nice ipod nice phone nice hat, comes up to me and says why did you steal my smoke. I had no idea what he was talking about, and he kept on saying that until all his Gunit buddies came, and i got the shit kicked out of me for something i didnt do. I guess it would of helped if i hadnt called them G units though:P</description>

umm no I live in a rich white suburb. sorry. The most “exciting” thing of the year was that the some kid got suspended for a day for selling knifes.<br>

That’s basically the subject of this thread…</p>
<p>Never been fully jumped. People have tried to start it, never finished it.<br>
They always seem to want something they obviously already have, them rich kids. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>
I’m glad we don’t really have chavs because ffs, those guys are way more annoying then someone who will actually jump you.</p>
<p>-Mh[/quote]<br>
I was refering to that fact that the poster said he thought that were rich thugs( or seomthing like that) where he lived. and I was saying that where i live there isn’t really any “gansters” or gangs</p>

There was like a huge pool of blood and then the paramedics came. Proof that 6th graders are wannabe tuffies.</p>

You made no sense at all there.<br>
Anyway, another story of mine is when I was in the U.A.E. and some rich guy had a gun (I was in the ghetto see), and he shot me and my lil’ bro, it was a rifle filled with rocks, we were only 7 &amp; 6 then so the rocks killed, but we fought back, made the guy bleed. Then he brought his gay crew out, and we got our cousins to help us out.<br>
Big brawl, and they never annoyed us again.</p>

<p>But anyway, me and 2 friends were out one night, going to pick up my brother(he’s 12, we need to walk past a school and it’s usually full of boozers/druggies), and my 2 friends are 15 and 16(I’m 15), and since it was like 10 at night, and no police are ever around, we all had booze, and like 4 druggies doped up tried to jump us for money/drugs/whatever, so one of my friends just smashed his bottle and threatened to bottle them, they kind of hesitated and went off. Like I said it was dark, no one saw each other’s faces…</p>

              <p>I live in a pretty bad area no lies, roaches the bug and the stub in my house - not exactly cream of the crop but It could always be alot worse. I know more black crack dealers that compton pumps out in the quarterly, I’m not gloryfying it because since I’m here I guess that makes me white Trash - What ever i know my own worth.<br>
I find the best way to deal with Wanksta’s is that if you make them feel stupid enough when they do decide to hit they do it in anger and you can usually expect it. Real G’s are another story unfortunately the sad reality is yeah some of these punks do have guns and they are too ignorant to know when to use them. Just always remember keep cool and I would suggest taking a couple actions toward bettering yourself physically for god forbid it should come a really bad attack - it will help with both body and mind.<br>
