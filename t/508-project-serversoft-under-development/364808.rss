    <description>[i]Project ServerSoft is an all new server, using it&#39;s own source. Most development on this server is Hand-made, and is in no way a replication of another source-code.[/i]

[b][size=13pt]Welcome to Project ServerSoft.[/b]

[size=11pt]Project ServerSoft is an all new source, with all new features. We&#39;re a growing server, and every day our server gains more intellectual knowledge than most sources. This thread will show you the features of this new server, in hope to gain [/size][b][size=8pt]Feed Back[/b][size=11pt] so we can make the server even better![/size]


[b]Updates that have reached their goal:[/b]


[ol][li]

[li][s]Anti-Nocliping of over 5,000 objects and walls! (This is a Huge milestone)[/s][/li]
[li][s]NPCs walk more efficiently and more activley than just standing there.[/s][/li]
[li][s]A constitution was written to the server so we can maintain the rules fairly.[/s][/li]

[li][s]ALL Doors in Varrock, Lumbridge, Draynor, and Wizards&#39; Tower are OPENABLE AND CLOSABLE[/s][/li]
[li][s]ALL Laders and Stairs in Varrock and Lumbridge are now CLIMBABLE![/s][/li]
[li][s]Hundreds and Hundreds of NPCs have been spread out through the entire server![/s][/li][/ol]


[size=10pt]These are all of the updates that have been completed successfully, under their deadline.  However, some still have a few bugs that need to be worked out. We are currently working on more though. Here&#39;s a list of other Updates that have already been added:



[ul][li][s]Duel Arena, AND Duel Tournaments with correct interfaces working.[/s][/li]
[li][s]Clan Wars, with working Clan System.[/s][/li]
[li][s]Bounty Hunter, with working crators (Also, we have added the arrow to appear over the targets head)[/s][/li]
[li][s]All skills have been added, except Summoning in which is being worked on.[/s][/li]
[li][s]The Skill&#39;s interface has been added, when clicking a skill icon in the skills&#39; tab.[/s][/li]
[li][s]Shops have also been added, with their Mainstock also the same as Player stock.[/s][/li]
[li][s]Over 9 different Quests, and two more being added![/s][/li]
[li][s]Clue Scrolls, AND Champion Scrolls found in a variety of locations![/s][/li]
[li][s]Random Events (Except when the random event goes away, the NPC remains in the same spot.[/s][/li]
[li][s]Miscellaneous Minigames, such as Godwars, Kalphite, and Barrows![/s][/li]
[li][s]Old-School Wilderness PKing has been added, with a variety of extra features.[/s][/li][/ul]


[size=13pt][b]Planned Features:[/b]

We have a variety of features planned for the feature. We also have added a Brand-New Membership system to the server, with over 75% of the server being Members-only! (Not including the features listed above). We are also Planning to add The Fist of Guthix, more areas accessible, with more features. More Quests, and other Minigames to earn some extra rewards. [i]Unfortunatley, there are no pictures. My computer don&#39;t have internet, so I use my laptop. My server however is on my other computer, with all my pictures, and I have no way of transferring them from one computer, to the other, without some sort of Flash drive, or at least some sort of connection type.[/i]


Project ServerSoft is Development Team, founded in Beardstown, Virginia, Jacksonville, and even Springfield, all in the state of Illinois. We have different members working on their own version of code to add to the server every day. Our main base, however, is located in [b]BeardStown, Illinois[/b]. Please, give some feed back, so we can make this server #1!</description>
