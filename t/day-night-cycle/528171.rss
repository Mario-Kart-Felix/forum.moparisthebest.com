    <title>Day/night cycle</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/day-night-cycle/528171</link>
    <description>Uhh, I haven&#39;t played for a while, but is the cycle 30 seconds now? How do you guys even play like this, I must of gone downstairs for a drink after it just turning day and it was night again. Obviously 30 seconds is hyperbole but it seems to me that when it finally turns day it&#39;s always raining, so even if if you get the enjoy the few minutes that you have as a starter you still have to put up with the rain and increased mob spawns that come with it. 

Is this something that we&#39;ve opted to do, or an update, or a game type or what? Or has it always been like this and I&#39;m just posting from nostalgic infused memories? I would prefer a minecraft world with long days, and long nights to one where you have like 40000000 days/night per real world day.</description>

              <p>I’ve seen on videos that day/night cycles can be messed up by lag, that might have happened but I don’t know.</p>
<p>But the rain is ridiculous.</p>

              <p>From what I can tell the day/night cycle remains the same at ~10 minutes each. Not sure how that happened to be honest, but I haven’t experienced anything abnormal as of yet.</p>
<p>For the question about rain, its always fucking raining</p>
