    <description>I&#39;ve made a 63 wave system it was good i guess. 
But i had a problem with it, some of the npcs arent aggresive and jad hit just once at the minigame. 
I have tried to check the aggresive file *jad is aggresive though* 
but it only hit one time then it stop being aggresive. 
Any ideas or anything?
