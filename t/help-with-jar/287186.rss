    <title>Help with jar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-jar/287186</link>
    <description>Hey, I forgot how to use JAR maker, so I tried to.
I made the jar by putting the output as client.jar input as (folder) on my desktop.
I left the manifest blank.
I signed it and etc.
But i tried to use the client.jar, but it said &quot;Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute from C:\Users\(user)\desktop\client.jar.&quot;
But I don&#39;t know what to put in the manifest thing.
Please help!</description>
