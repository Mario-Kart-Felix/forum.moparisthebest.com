    <title>Problem with areas</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-areas/301254</link>
    <description>Hey everyone!

I have messed around quite while now with rsc private servers, making it like real rsc with alot updates. But i got stucked in Entrana Cave. I added that area into point area, but when u enter into that cave ur prayer will be drained and i wanted to add that drain. Tryed into gameEngine.java:
[code]for(Player p : world.getPlayers()) {
					if(p.getLocation().inEntranaCave()) {
							p.addPrayerDrain(10);
								p.getActionSender().sendStat(5);
							
					}
			}[/code]
Added that, its working tho but problem is it drains prayer outside of cave tho. if i login in the cave it will start draining. But it will continue draining outside the cave to, when i relog it stops. Tryed different things with that code but i cant make perfectly working code. 
Maybe someone could help me out with this, would really appreaciate that!
Thank you for reading!
