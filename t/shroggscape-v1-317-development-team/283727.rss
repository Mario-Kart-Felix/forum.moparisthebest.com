    <description>[center][u][i][b][size=30pt]shroggscape v1 development team!
[/size]
[/b][/i][/u]

OK in the past few weeks Ive been coding a 317 server.
it has got all of the usual things, but lately I&#39;ve been a bit chilaxed and i decided i need some co-coders.


we will be using drop-box for the server coding.
if you don&#39;t know what it is look at [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,368114.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,368114.0.html[/url]
it is really  handy. trust me

so, here&#39;s the server and the team so far.

[size=20pt][i][b]THE SERVER SO FAR.[/b][/i][/size]

the server uses a devolution v7 base which is working very well.
i have coded some skills to work but i am still working on:

fetching
wood cutting
mining
agility
farming
herblore
cooking

The server consists of 3 [i]&quot;homes&quot;[/i], these homes are places for players of around the same combat
or skill levels to hang out.


each &quot;home&quot; consists of shops, mini games, quests and training areas

[size=15pt][i]the homes are:[/i][/size]
NOOB: ENTRANA  
MEDIUM LEVEL: DRAYNOR
HIGH LEVEL:TZARR

[b][i]PICTURES.[/i][/b]

Some noob shops

Noob training area

<p>Why would you want to use an old Devolution if you could use Final Devolution 2.5, with perfect PVP?</p>

<p>Would you rather work with a shitty server that you know needs work or one that is like 99.999999% done. If I were shrogg, I would try to use maybe rs2dv or even try to make my own server from scratch. That is a great development team <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
