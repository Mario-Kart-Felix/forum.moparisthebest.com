    <description>Hey guys I just wanted to share what me and my friend made together are just a large variety of teleportation codes and items. Usually items that you would have to spawn. I have upploaded this to www.uppit.com because &quot; the message exceeded the allowed length of 20000 characters &quot; lol so i went ahead and uploaded it for you server owners that can find this handy. Remember keep our names in your mouth when usint this :)
