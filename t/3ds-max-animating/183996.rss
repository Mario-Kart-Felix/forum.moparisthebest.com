    <description>Can some one tell me how to link a skeleton to a model in 3ds max? I have a model of a character, it is all complete with textures, and I just finished the skeleton for it, accept I don&#39;t know how I would link them together and get the joints to look right when they moved.

-----------------

Edit: I got the skeleton finally, but it deforms funny as hell in places and I cannot get the to look right at all. 
So what I need now is advice on how to make the head move right, maybe how to open and close the mouth, and how to get everything to deform more realistically, right now stuff near the joints is moving. And last is, how would I make like an IK dummy next to my main model that would move the skeleton so I don&#39;t have to hide a body part to move a joint
Any help is welcome, thanks in advanced.</description>

              <p>Hmm, yea most of my poly’s are square, don’t know how to check for 5 point ones and I have over 6k poly’s without turbosmooth on so i can’t search manually. I actually threw out the skeleton I had done because it deformed to much and stuck out of the models skin everywhere. There any way I can tell it that I want 4 side polys? wasn’t even gunna go for facial expressions right now cause my models face is way to complicated…</p>
<p>ok, well right now i am more for making this model look right i guess, but once I am done wiht htis, alsol, would linking the clothes to the skin make them move or should I just add physique and make them rigid?</p>

              <p>Actually DON’T use a triangle mesh. Unless you’ve very experienced with them, don’t bother. Unless it is a game model.</p>
<p>If it’s not, make sure all your polygons are quads, and make sure you don’t have any 5-points. All of that will cause bad deformation.</p>
<p>Then, look up some tutorials online for 3DSMax rigging and such.</p>
<p>For the facial expressions, you’ll need more bones in the head to control each one of them.</p>
