<p>Personally I believe ADD exists, just that it’s pretty overdiagnosed and maybe used as an excuse by some. As for “why do they keep handing it out” - because its pretty effective in people with real cases of ADD. A few people may have a bad reaction to it, but is that any reason to stop all the people it would help from being allowed it? Many more people have reactions to opiates, so if you ever get hit by a bus, make sure you refuse the morphine <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Neuropharmacology is nowhere near as clear-cut as “this will make you think suicidally” “this won’t” “this will cure your depression” “this won’t”. People rip the shit out of doctors for making mistakes with medication all the time, without realising humans know a lot less about the brain than they realise. Sure, we’ve named some neurotransmitters and figured out roughly what they do and how we can manipulate them, but why would drug a cause massive amounts of neurotransmitter b to be produced in most of the population, but cause something completely different to happen in person c?</p>
<p>Doctors are keeping up a constant juggling act most of the time, and I have respect for the job they’re doing.

Another thing, the teachers and students admitted that he was made fun of and bullied. He was asked to read from a book out loud, and he had a speech problem, so the kids said “go back to china”.

I never thought of it like that, maybe the only cause of school shootings is insanity.   Bullying and other stuff just adds on, or “triggers” this into violence.</p>

<p>If we find the cause, we can bring the 32 people back? No. Could finding the cause help prevent it again? Possibly. We already knew the cause. He warned them before he did it. There was a two hour window they could have taken the students out of the school, except for the two he shot before running off to the post office.</p>
<p>Another thing, the teachers and students admitted that he was made fun of and bullied. He was asked to read from a book out loud, and he had a speech problem, so the kids said “go back to china”. I’ve seen the video that was on NBC, and you can tell he DID have a mental problem, or was just very high.  He contradicted himself many times. He said he was doing it for the weak and defenseless, yet he killed the weak and defenseless.</p>

Very good point. No one would take 30+ lives then turn the gun to himself (that happend right?) and not be Insane Or Crazy/Wrong in the head…<br>
Unless they were sick minded…Or very high.<br>
I was thinking they might have been abused by parents? and then mayby bullied at school that made the guy snap? But anyway, this shouldn’t of happend, i think he must has been Nuts/insane/crazy or wrong in the head.</p>
