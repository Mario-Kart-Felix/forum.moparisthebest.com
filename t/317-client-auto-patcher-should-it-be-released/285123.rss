    <title>[317 client auto patcher] should it be released</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-client-auto-patcher-should-it-be-released/285123</link>
    <description>i have finally made a 317 client with auto patcher it works very good but the thing is that it has never been done and i think if i release it then all the leechers are going to try and claim that they made it. give me some feed back if i should release it and if i do all the files will be encrypted so leechers cant clain it hehe. and it will also work on all the other clients out there. it cost about 42$ to copyright the auto patcher should that be done first or what. it also has a server side that works on your computer that works the auto patcher that is built in the client.</description>

              <p>By ‘auto patcher’ I assume you mean that it updates the client to the latest version before running it?  If so, of course it has been done before, I would even call it almost trivial.  MoparScape has that ability for one, along with others I am sure.</p>
<p>If you are going to release it, release it under the GNU/GPL license (or another open source license), or don’t release it at all.</p>
