    <title>How do make &#39;follow&#39; work in the Context Menu?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-make-follow-work-in-the-context-menu/353041</link>
    <description> Guys, I&#39;m working with a server here, and they give the code so that i can have the option to follow someone, but when I right click them and click &#39;follow&#39; (keep in mind, it won&#39;t even highlight, which I wouldn&#39;t mind figuring out how too). Anyways, when I click &#39;follow&#39; it will say in the chat box below &quot;you are following (playername)&quot; but I wont&#39; be following them. Thanks, I would love it if you could help.

PS - i&#39;m using a 317 server.</description>
