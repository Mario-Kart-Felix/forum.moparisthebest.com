    <description>b][size=120]The Exiled is now recruiting ![/size][/b]


We are a group of hackers and coders that has united in order to achieve greater goals. We are the whitehat heroes of cyberspace (with a pinch of grey). We have chosen to make it our responsibility to keep order in the online world. We are The Exiled.



In order to join the group:


[ul]1) You need to be mature. If you are not mature you are not welcome.

2) You need to understand that the point of this group [u]isn&#39;t[/u] to increase your &quot;hacker fame&quot;. The group was created to better our [u]learning[/u] experience as a group and only that. If you cannot understand this then you do not belong with us, and you will not be approved.

3) You cannot join the group if you have no experience at all, you should know at least a few things.

4) If you are too inactive after approval, you will be taken into consideration by the admins &amp; moderators, and if they dont feel that your contribution to the team is big enough, you will be kicked.

5) [b][u]NO[/u][/b] infecting or scamming fellow members. If you are caught doing so you will get kicked immediatly.[/ul]



Everyone&#39;s primary role is to help each other out and to create a nice environment for everyone. Some people will get higher ranks than others of course, depending on their knowledge, maturity and commitment to the group.
