              <p>You’re going to want to use a vote system tutorial if your not fluent in PHP, Java, and MySQL.</p>
<p>That’s because the voting uses callbacks, which most people use PHP to read, and then save it to a MySQL table for their server to read (Using java of course).</p>
<p>Adding the commands (At least the ::vote ones) are easy depending on what source you have.<br>
Adding ::claim will depend on whether or not you follow a tutorial. If you follow one, it’s easy (They give it to you - usually) if not, you’d have to write the code yourself… which would be getting data from the database and then finding the specified username, if it exists, and so on.</p>
<p>It is also <span class="bbcode-b">required</span> that you have REMOTE MySQL on your website, or where ever your MySQL database is. That’s because your server is typically not on the same machine as the MySQL database, so you must access it remotely.</p>
<p>You didn’t tell us any information about your server… so it’s kind of hard to say what your command needs to look like, but here is a generic one:</p>
<p><code>if(playerCommand.equalsIngoreCase("vote")) {
     sendFrame126("www.google.com", 12000);
</code><br>
if <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a> does not work, try <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://google.com</a></p>
<p>And if neither work, check into your client and make sure it is set up to use frame 12000 for opening websites.</p>
