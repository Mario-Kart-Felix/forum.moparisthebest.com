    <title>64 bit Windows 7 error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/64-bit-windows-7-error/313929</link>
    <description>Alright this problem isn&#39;t something only I got but also every other 64 bit user and I&#39;m talking 64 bit this has nothing to do with windows 7 I googled I tried everything but i can&#39;t find the answer. I did find people who had the same problem as I do though but in the topics I didn&#39;t find any answers. However let&#39;s get to the problem, everytime I run a 317 client the client just closes after 10 seconds of gameplay.

[b]FIRST OF ALL I HAVE THE RIGHT 64 BIT JAVA SO DON&#39;T TELL ME TO GET THAT
AND SECOND OF ALL IT&#39;S NOT THE SERVER AND ALSO NOT THE CLIENT WHEN I RUN IT ON MY OTHER PC IT WORKS FINE (WINDOWS 7 32 BIT) AND IM NOT IN THE MOOD TO REINSTALL MY LAPTOP[/b]</description>
