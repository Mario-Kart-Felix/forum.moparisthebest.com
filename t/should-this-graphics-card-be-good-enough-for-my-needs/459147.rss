    <description>Well after looking for a graphics card that would accommodate my rather crappy PSU, I found [url=http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-8400-gs]this.[/url] Although it isn&#39;t the greatest card, on a budget will this be good enough to run a few games and perhaps help with video capturing/editing?</description>

My friend did give me his old case since he upgraded his, but the PCI slots don’t line up on the mobo and there isn’t anywhere for the power button to connect to. Plus, I can’t even use the psu he gave me since it doesn’t have some of the plugs I need for my board. It doesn’t bother me too much though, I’m just glad I found something that I can use without needing other parts for once.</p>
<p>The 8400 should help improve performance for video editing though, right? Because that is a large reason why I want it.</p>
