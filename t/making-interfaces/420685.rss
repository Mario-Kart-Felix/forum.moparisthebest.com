    <description>This is the best i can do cus the way thhis forum works u cant use color inside codes


Im going to try and make this as simple as possible so hopefully I can...

Difficulty - 4/10
Base - PI
Revision - 317
Sexy - Yes

Ok first off open up RsInterface.java

Step1:

Search for

aClass44 = archive;


Step 2:

underneath this copy one of the names that shud look somthing like this

extraEquipment(rsFonts);


Step 3:
above wut is in red you will change to the name u want your interface to be
so it will now look like this(were going to use PCShop for this)

PcShop(rsFonts);


Step 4:
now search for friendtab you should see somthing like this

public static void friendsTab(RSFont[] tda) {


Step 5:
now where you see friendsTab you wwould change that to PcShop
so it would look like

public static void PcShop(RSFont[] tda) {


Step 6:
now underneath that friends tab you will see 

RSInterface tab = addTabInterface(5065);

the number you see in red is the interfaces id to open that up....
you can change that to what ever you want but if  it is the same as a dif one you will either get a compiling error a loading error or a fu**ed up interface when u open it in game

Step 7:
change that number to what you want im gonna use 18700, so it will look like this

RSInterface tab = addTabInterface(18700);


Step 8:
now you will start adding the pictures/text/hovers/buttons/etc...
after you added

RSInterface tab = addTabInterface(18700);
you will add - THIS IS A SPRITE

addSprite(18701, 0, Interfaces/PcShop/Back);

yellow - is the id of that
red - is the number after the name of the png file so it would be Back 0
green - the location of the file that you are grabbing


thats for sprites... if you dont wanna add a sprite u can add a text
so under
RSInterface tab = addTabInterface(18700);
you would add 

addText(18701, Friends List, tda, 1, 0xff9933, true, true);

Wut you see in yellow is the text that will be placed whitch later can be changed thru your server using sendFrame126...

What you see in red is the size of the text that is there

wut you see in green is the color of the text that appears


again dont want it to be a sprite or a text? Well here now u can add a single button no hover
so again under
RSInterface tab = addTabInterface(18700);
you will add

addButton(18701, 0, Interfaces/PcShop/Back, Click);

yellow- again is where it is locating the file
red - is wut will appear when u hover or right click the button that shows up
green- is the number after the sprite u use to is would be  Back 0 in ur folder.


Agian you dont want any of these and u want somthing cooler? like indents and color changing in ur sprite?

this is where we will add hovers now

again under
RSInterface tab = addTabInterface(18700);
you will add

addHoverButton(18701, Interfaces/PcShop/Back, 2, 38, 36, Open, -1, 18702, 1);
addHoveredButton(18702, Interfaces/PcShop/Back, 12, 38, 36, 18703);

Red - is the number it changes to when u hover on the button so that it changes.
Yellow - is the dimensions of the png file so if you got a box thats a 4x4 you would change the 38, 36 to 4, 4 this is also where it registers where it will change to the next picture in the hover so it basically can be as big as you want
green- wut u see in green is the number of the file so like again Back 2 changes to Back 12 when you hover over it changing the picture.
purple- wut u see in purple is the text that will appear in the top left corner or when u right click it
SkyBlue- is the final number(i think lol) it basically is stopping the button and when u add anotehr hover button you have to be 1 above that so it would go from ending at 18703 to a new one starting at 18704


Step 9:
In this step you will place the pictures/text/buttons/etc.. where you desire

once your done adding all ur button etc... you will place this under the last one

 tab.totalChildren(9);

the number in red above is howmany things are being added whitch is the number of text/buttons/etc... you have all together

^ under that you will be adding where the picture or text is placed

tab.child(0,18701, 29, 20);

Yellow - is the number that makes the totalChildren going up by 1 each time starting at 0 so if u hit 10 it would be 11
red - is the id of the interface part that your placing part that your placing
Green - this is where it is being placed the first number is the x coord and the second is the y coord to get these in game ttype :: dataon and when u move ur mouse the numbers will appear in the bottom left corner of ur client.


If i missed anything please tell me i dont think i did so yah :D

/end
