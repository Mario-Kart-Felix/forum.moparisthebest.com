    <description>[center][b][size=25pt]This tutorial will teach you how to make your server 24/7 with vps or dedicated server.[/size] [/b]




This is how to setup server on vps. To learn how to run server on your home computer go to http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,342685.0.html.




Pleas do not flame me this is my first tutorial. If you don&#39;t like it simply tell me what i need to fix/add to make my tutorial more understandable, and imformative.



What is vps?: Vps or virtual private server is comenly used when your house computer does not run fast enuf or your server constantly crashes and is an amazing way to keep your Runescape private server online 24/7. This also reduces lag, nulling, crashes, and even spammers succecfully crashing you, to a tremendous amount.



Difficulty level 1/10.
Needed Knowlage: Basic knowledge on typeing and reading.




Step 1 Getting your vps: There are many differen&#39;t website&#39;s that offer Cheap - Very expensive vps based on Ram, Processor, Bandwith. I prefer http:www.swvps.com Because it is cheap, Great customer service, And a guarenteed 99.6 uptime monthly (Most of the time 100%). Depending on how many players you have on your server you will need a differen&#39;t amount of Ram/Bandwith. 2gb ram can hold around 120, 4gb 240 ect. 



Step 2 Connecting to your vps: Once you have purchased the vps from 12-48 hours you will recieve a message from Sales@swvps.com &lt;blockquote&gt;Computer: 64.191.**.** Your login username is: AdministratorYour login password is: **************&lt;/blockquote&gt; On Windows or vista open the start menu, Click all programs, Accessories, Remote Desktop Connection. After opened you will be asked for a computer, enter the ip that was given to you. On the next page enter the password given to you, and click Ok. Congratulations you have just connected to your vps.



Step 3 Setting up JDK: To run any runescape private server you need Jdk go to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp search JDK 6 Update 16 and click download. Put your computer platform and click i agree and continue. Check all of the boxes and click Download Selected with Sun Manager. After download install it. (duh)



Step 4 getting winrar: You must get winrar for you vps because you will need to transfer your server files. Go to http:www.rarlab.com download and install. Go to Your server files, Right click and click add to &quot;Filename.rar&quot; (may take a minute to zip). To put your download online go to. www.uppit.com or www.mediafire.com.



Step 5 How to download stuff on your vps: Your vps may not allow you to download files. 
Go to start
Control panel
Select Internet Options 
Click on the Security tab 
Click on the Custom Level button 
Scroll down to Downloads: Automatic prompting for file downloads 
Click on Enable 



Step 6 Setting up your Environmental Variables: Go to start --&gt; Control panel --&gt; System --&gt; System Properties --&gt; Environment Variables --&gt; Under System variables --&gt; New --&gt; Variable name = classpath --&gt; Variable value = CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16\bin;%CLASSPATH%; (java is updated about every 5 months the  version changes smply make the 16, 17-18 and so forth.



Step 7 Running your server: Now your finished download the file you posted to uppit or mediafire (Any download hosting site) Unzip it and click run!
