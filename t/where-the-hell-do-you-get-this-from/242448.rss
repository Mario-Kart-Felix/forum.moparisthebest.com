    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-the-hell-do-you-get-this-from/242448</link>
    <description>Ok, I have downloaded the Bann3dScape source (piece of shit). There was one col thing. When you run the server, Miss Silabsoft server console pops up. You can IP ban and stuff like that. No, wtf is her problem? I tried to send her a message to where I can get it. and she can&#39;t even reply. So, if someone can help me. I&#39;d greatly appreciate it. 



Thanks.</description>
