    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/very-bad-vps-help/518281</link>
    <description>hey guys so i recently purchased a vps from porthosts.com for a decent price. i have never activated a vps on my computer yet, i knew right from the getko i had to let it through my firewall and portforward it, but when i try to log in it says logon faild, i even sent a support ticket and they gave me a new password and it still didnt work so i know its something via my computer. if someoen could teamview me that would be excellent, or even if u could give me a header on what to do, btw when i portforward port 80 what ip would i use, when i use my ipv4 port 80 isnt seen on canyouseeme, same if just try my regular ip.. could someone please help me with this? very appreciated thanks :)</description>

              <p>You don’t need to forward the port on the vps. Make sure you’ve added the exception to your firewall on the vps. If you wish to forward the port you can its just not really needed.</p>
