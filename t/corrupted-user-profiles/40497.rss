    <title>Corrupted User Profiles</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/corrupted-user-profiles/40497</link>
    <description>New to this forum, i only know some gaming forums for techy help, im a retired runescape player until i recieve a white/yellow party hat from anyone. I have been retired for 2 years now :P. However i was only on this forum 1 minuite when i saw the homework section... Useful and in someone&#39;s sig you can set runescape as your background, thats awesome. So maybe ill use this forum more.

Copy and pasting...

When i loaded up my computer today it said it could not load my profile because it was corrupted, please contact my adminstrator.

Then it gave me another message then another one about importing files and .INI.. i had no idea what it was talking about i just wanted to see if my computer was alright.

So now that i&#39;ve loaded i can see that im missing alot of things, my firefox history, cookies, etc. My preferences in the star bar, anything that was saved on my desktop (not shortcuts), stuff in my documents, my recieved files. On my itunes its giving me all this welcome to itunes bullshit, its acting like im uing all my programs for the first time. Norton is fully updated though.

I tried a system restore to yesterday and it said no changes had been made, so that didn&#39;t help.

This really sucks, much help appreciated.

Since then i have found all the other &#39;missing&#39; stuff from my desktop in my documents and settings. I guess i can just copy and paste this into my new desktop in my new profile if i can&#39;t restore my old profile. However whenever i restart my computer it says the profile is corrupted even on this new one.. Im not sure what to do. So basically i need to stop my profile being corrupted...Is this a virus?</description>
