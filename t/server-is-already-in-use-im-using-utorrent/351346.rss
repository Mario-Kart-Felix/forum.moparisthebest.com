    <title>Server is already in use? (im using utorrent)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-is-already-in-use-im-using-utorrent/351346</link>
    <description>okay so im using utorrent, and i have a source and a client and all that and i didnt feel like doing portforwarding because i already had utorrent. So whenever i open up my run.bat it just says server is already in use...Any suggestions?

also. i made a server with my friend before and well i remember going to the gui and changing the i.p would i still have to do all that with utorrent? because i dont know if that&#39;s that same.</description>
