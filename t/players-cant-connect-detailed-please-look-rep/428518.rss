    <title>Players can&#39;t connect. [ DETAILED - Please look!] REP++!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/players-cant-connect-detailed-please-look-rep/428518</link>
    <description>Okay so i&#39;m running my 317 DELTA Server [u]off of my laptop[/u] (for now) using Verizon Internet. 

I have a ProLine DSL Modem given to my by Verizon. It is not a wireless router. It is Ethernet only.

I hooked a NETGEAR router up so I can connect my laptop wirelessly.



192.168.1.1 takes me to my modem.
In my modem settings I have the ports set to be forwarded to my router.

Then 10.0.0.1 takes me to my router.
In my router settings I have the correct ports forwarded to my laptops IP.



I posted my server on the Server Status Page and it got accepted and is now posted.
But, players still can&#39;t log on weather it be using MoparScape Client, or my OleanPkz Client.

Idk if it&#39;s a connection problem, or it&#39;s a problem with my client but I will rep++ and give you credit in my server.

CLIENT DL: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ZG0OGXXZ

(Look over the files. Let me know!)
GUI is set to IP: OleanPk.no-ip.org

Thanks!</description>

<p>How long have you used your no-ip account. Sometimes <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> will suspend your host name happened to me a few times. Login to your no-ip account and renew your host information. You connection is fine, and your ports sound like they are forwarded correctly.  :rolleyes:</p>

<p>The problem was resolved. It was a error in my GUI and client.java (client sided)</p>
<p>But thanks anyways!</p>
