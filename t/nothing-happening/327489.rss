    <description>When I turn on my server... Nothing happens... I log on, it turns my screen black and nothing happens, I&#39;ve tried multiple clients and they all do the same thing, I have tried everything in my server files nothing does anything. I had added a random event box, and it worked fine before that, I removed it, and had even saved backup of my server before I added it, my old and new files don&#39;t work... I am stumped on what I possibly did wrong... Any idea&#39;s?

(Ever since this Java update was available seems I&#39;ve had this problem, could it be something with that? Not sure...)</description>

<p>Yes, other sources work, it is just my main one that I just started having problems with.</p>
