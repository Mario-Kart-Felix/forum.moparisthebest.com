    <title>Looking for Team - Standard Requirements</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-team-standard-requirements/547633</link>
    <description>I&#39;m wanting to find team members to build multiple types of applications from simple resource programs to multiplayer games. I would like to have an eclectic team of people, so finding this team shouldn&#39;t be that hard on these forums....:rolleyes: Most applications we make would be cross-platform and accessible on Android and iOS.

[size=11pt][i]Any client made will be written in Java. Servers for multiplayer games can be written in C# or Java.[/i][/size]

[center][size=14pt]Requirements[/size][/center]

1. Getting familiar with some of these libraries is going to be a [b]MUST[/b]

[ul][li][url=http://www.lwjgl.org/]LWJGL[/url][/li]
[li][url=http://www.robovm.com/]RoboVM[/url][/li]
[li][url=https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html?hl=i]Android SDK[/url][/li]
[li][url=http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/]LibGDX[/url][/li]
[li][url=http://netty.io/]Netty (preferrably Netty 5)[/url][/li][/ul]


2. Standard Knowledge over [b]at least one of these languages[/b]; completing a set of instructions on designing a system would not be a problem.

[ul][li]Java - This languages is class-based and object-oriented supported by multiple platforms like Android, Windows, and Mac OS X.[/li]
	[li]C# - This language is multi-paradigm combining principles from C and C++ with a general purpose to develop software for Microsoft[/li]
	[li]Python - This language is pretty easy to use (especially for plugin systems) and shortens programming time along with lines[/li]
	[li]Ruby - This language can be quite similar to Python, with some obvious major differences and is also easy to use and shortens programming time and lines[/li]
	[li]PHP - This language is used mostly for building websites.[/li][/ul]


3. Use of any of the following Git Version Control Systems should be easy

[ul][li][url=https://github.com/]GitHub[/url][/li]
[li][url=https://bitbucket.org/]BitBucket[/url][/li][/ul]


4. Proof of work by using the method below

[ul][li]Live Coding Samples via Skype for an instructional session + questions[/li][/ul]
