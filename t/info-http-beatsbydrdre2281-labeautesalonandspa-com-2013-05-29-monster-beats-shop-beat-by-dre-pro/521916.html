Two small airplanes collided in mid-air above the heavily inhabited San Fernando Valley.The two create involved were a good experimental, home created ultra-light and a single serp plane. “Right after the impact in the air, I found both planes spin out of control down,” said a witness.4 people, all aboard the planes, were killed. No one on the ground ended up being injured, though a lot of feared they’d get hit by debris. "In entrance of me, I merely saw an airplane spiraling down nose initial, and I thought for sure it was gonna strike the freeway,In . said a experience. The experimental home-built airplane actually landed inverted in a field next to the freeway, but the more substantial, single engine airplane regained control as it were, then plunged into a power line as well as exploded just higher than the golf course."I was about hitting my shot, merely basically a hundred feet from the airplane. When we looked up, we noticed the explosion,Inch said one of the golfers on the course. "We analyzed to see this additional aircraft just plummeting straight down almost together with our heads."There ended up almost two thousand tiny plane crashes last year. Still, it’s a unusual occurrence for two airplanes to collide within mid-air.

In working on this tale, CBS News Connect Producer Shawn Efran spent lots of time with <a href="http://amazon.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon.com</a> founder Jeff Bezos : and got to see some surprising aspects of the actual billionaire Web merchant. Here are some of his or her recollections: Ask 35-year-old millionaire Bezos to describe himself and that he says that he’s “nerdy.” Ask him to describe his family and he states that he, his buddy and his father are downright “goofy.” "You will not likely believe this,Inches he says, "but we make believe you be Navy Elephant seals. We have those small mobile, talk-about radios so we have the little ear canal pieces and the lapel microphones. Even something as simple as likely to pick up a quart associated with milk at the supermarket we’ll turn into a Dark blue SEAL operation…It is extremely very goofy."After discovering Bezos’s office, it’s not hard to consider. The room is chaotic with toys. The yellow rubber duck sits on the computer. LEGOs lie in the corner. His / her dry cleaning hangs on an exposed club along one wall structure, opposite a lone decor - a spray-painted signal that reads “<a href="http://amazon.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon.com</a>.” The office looks more like a teen-ager’s bed room than ground zero in a retailing emerging trend. But from guiding his desk made of scrap wood, this particular goofy CEO has generated one of the fastest-growing companies ever sold and has his some competitors, the ones together with real offices, questioning what business miracle he’ll perform following.
