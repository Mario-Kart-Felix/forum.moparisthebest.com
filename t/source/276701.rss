    <description>I was wondering how do i empty source files without messing up the server. I want to delete all the commands, teleports, and ect. 
Im trying to make a blank source, in which i can make my own &amp; hopefully get some rep from making sources. Im a decent coder, 
but im having some problems with it, so how do i make a blank source without making it useless.

1) How do i make a blank source?
2) Or can someone give me a download link for a blank source? 


I would download from the downloads page, but those sources arent what im looking for. And i would like to be sure they dont have a virus
like the other one i was planning to download.</description>
