    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ports-randomly-dont-work-anymore/442124</link>
    <description>My ports were working for months. Now they don&#39;t.

- I have them in the firewall

- I have them forwarded correctly

- I HAVE a static Ip

The odd part is when I host on my laptop they all work fine. But when I try on my computer the host computer they don&#39;t.... Help?</description>
