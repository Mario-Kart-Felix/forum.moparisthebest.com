    <title>Drop rate bonuses for different difficulty levels</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/drop-rate-bonuses-for-different-difficulty-levels/550739</link>
    <description>This may be an easy problem for someone else to solve, but I&#39;m stumped.
I&#39;ve been working on it for hours, no luck.
So now I am asking you, please help me solve this problem. 
I am not asking for step by step instructions, but a push in the right direction.

This is the code in player.java - .10 = 10% but the problem is that it doesn&#39;t actually effect anything. Tried changing a couple to .90 to test and make sure it was working, absolutely no change whatsoever in drops.
[spoiler]public double getDropBonus() {
		double bonus = 1.00;
		if (getEquipment().getRingId() == 2572)
    		bonus += 0.10;
	    if (getDifficulty() == 1)
	    	bonus -= 0.10;
	    if (getDifficulty() == 2)
	    	bonus -= 0.05;
	    if (getDifficulty() == 4)
	    	bonus += 0.05;
	    if (getDifficulty() == 5)
	    	bonus += 0.10;
	    return bonus;
	}[/spoiler]

This is ofcourse from the Rune-Evo v3 source, so that you have a reference.
If you need any other snippets to get a better idea of what to do, let me know.
Thanks in advance.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>In your first randomly generated example, the .9 actually reduces the chance of it ending up in the drop pool, whereas in the second example it increased the chances of it ending up in the drop pool.<br>
So from what I can gather yes, the way I handled it is correct.<br>
10% better chance of it going into the drop pool.<br>
Now anyone on a higher difficulty has it in the drop pool and therefore as a possible drop more often, whereas someone on the easiest difficulty will have absolutely no chance of an item that originally has a 10% or less droprate going into the drop pool therefore eliminating the chance that they would get that drop.</p>
<p>Cool, thanks for the help man.<br>
I thought I was gonna go crazy for a while there.</p>

              <p><code>                if (dropRate == 100) {
                    sendDrop(killer, drop);
                } else {
                   if (Utils.random(1, 100) &lt;= (drop.getRate() + killer.getDropBonus()) {
                      possibleDrops[possibleDropsCount++] = drop;
                   }
                }</code><br>
So let me explain this part of the code to you.</p>
<p><code>                if (dropRate == 100) {// If the dropRate double is equal to 100, drop the item no matter what.
                    sendDrop(killer, drop);
                } else {// Else, lets roll for the drop.
                   if (Utils.random(1, 100) &lt;= (drop.getRate() + killer.getDropBonus()) {//If a random value of 1-100 is less than or equal to the value of the item's drop rate, plus the player's bonus, add the item to the possible drop.
                      possibleDrops[possibleDropsCount++] = drop;
                   }
                }</code></p>
<p>Lets put numbers in place of the words and see what we get.<br>
I generated a random number using <a href="http://random.org" rel="nofollow noopener">random.org</a>. lol</p>
<p><code>if(22 &lt;= (4.2 * .9)) {// 4.2 * .9 is 3.78
// Give player item
}</code><br>
As you can see in this scenario, 22 is greater than 3.78, therefore this item won’t be added to the possible loot.<br>
And this time using addition:</p>
<p><code>if(29 &lt;= (5.1 + .9)) {// 5.1 + .9 is 6
// Give player item
}</code><br>
Again, it wouldn’t give the player the item, but you can see by using different operators you get significantly different results.</p>

              <p>Actually I managed to find that code that calls for the bonus.<br>
[spoiler]for (Drop drop : drops) {<br>
double dropRate = drop.getRate();</p>
<pre><code>            if (dropRate == 100) {
                sendDrop(killer, drop);
            } else {
            	if (Utils.random(1, 100) &lt;= (drop.getRate() + killer.getDropBonus()) {
            		possibleDrops[possibleDropsCount++] = drop;
            	}
            }
        }
        
        if (possibleDropsCount &gt; 0) {
            sendDrop(killer, possibleDrops[Utils.getRandom(possibleDropsCount - 1)]);
        }[/spoiler]
</code></pre>
<p>Where it says drop.getRate() + killer.getDropBonus()) it used to say * instead of +.<br>
That was multiplying the rate and i believe cutting some items out of the drop pool completely.<br>
Plus on lower difficulty levels it was making items into negative chance drop rates since it was multiplying a negative number.</p>
<p>Anyways overall what the code was saying was that anything that was greater than the random roll of 1-100 gets put into the possible drops pool, then the game gives you 1 of the possible drops. And since it wasn’t adding the bonus but multiplying the numbers the pool was completely screwed up. Ofcourse if 10 items get added to the pool you end up with a 1/10 or 10% chance to get the drop. So really its saying you have a 8% chance to have a 10% chance to get a particular item(the %chances ofcourse relying on the overall drop rate of the particular item, and the total number of items that fell into the pool).</p>
<p>So I made the drop rate add the drop bonus(which I changed from .1 to 10 since I dont believe that .1 stands for 10 percent in the original code i posted), which effectively increases the chances that rarer drops will end up in the drop pool for people with higher difficulties, while decreasing the chance that rarer drops will end up in the drop pool for people with lower difficulties.<br>
Which also means that if I want something to drop more commonly I have just to decrease the amount of possible drops for that particular monster.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?<br>
Maybe I handled the code wrong, or my understanding is completely wrong?<br>
Please let me know.</p>
