    <title>Project KSAM - Server Development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-ksam-server-development/291910</link>
    <description>Project KSAM is probably one of my bigest developments in all time, edited from my previous source, Tanked-Up, I plan to make a succesful server, that sorts everyones needs, from skilling to PKing.

I am currently working on content to get people wanting to join, and after the recent success of a PK Points system, coded by me, I think I am well on my way to creating a good server.

I have made Dark Bow Special attaks work properly, and they can hit harder now. Added a Saradomin Sword and working on its special, need to know where to add the special emote. Fixed slayer helm looks for new client that will be released to my members soon.


I am working on the following things... Red means not started, Green means finished and Orange means in progress.

Working Barrows Chest - 75%
Add drops to all monsters at a good rate - 32%
Make a new town from scratch - 0%
Make an update NPC that sais updates - 0%
