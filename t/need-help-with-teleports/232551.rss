    <description>Hi, I need help with teleports!

I know how to change teleports from the emote tab, but I am unsure of how to change teleports on the mage tab. For example, I want Varrock to teleport to a training area instead of Varrock. I have right-clicked it and tried to find the number that showed up in my Client.Java, but I could not find it. I also tried looking at the command prompt after I teleported. I tried to find that number in my Client.Java, but I was out of luck also.

Can someone please help me, and tell me what to do? Thanks!

P.S. - I&#39;m not going to be a noob and say, &quot;If you give me a good answer, I will rep you!&quot;, because I can&#39;t rep yet, and I won&#39;t lie about it.

Thanks again!</description>
