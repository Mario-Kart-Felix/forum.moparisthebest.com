    <title>Who vs. Whom; A lesson on grammar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-vs-whom-a-lesson-on-grammar/203872</link>
    <description>Well apparently not so many of you are aware of when to use who vs whom in a sentence.

Who: Subject
Whom: Indirect / Receiver / Observer

For example, if you&#39;re talking about someone performing an action, use who. If you&#39;re talking about someone receiving or being an observer to an action, use whom.

[b]Examples:[/b]

[s]&quot;Whom are you talking to?&quot;[/s] &quot;To whom are you talking?&quot; -- You are doing the talking, and someone else is receiving the action of talking.
&quot;Who is there?&quot; -- Someone is there, performing the action of being.
[s]&quot;Whom did you give it to?&quot;[/s] &quot;To whom did you give it?&quot; -- You are doing the giving, someone else is the receiver of the action.
&quot;To whom it may concern&quot; -- [i]It[/i] is doing the concerning.
&quot;Who gave the gift to you?&quot; -- Someone else was doing the giving.
&quot;Who killed him?&quot; -- Someone was doing the killing.
&quot;The people who abused him were put in jail.&quot; -- [i]Him[/i] is the receiver of the action of abusing, which was performed by someone else.</description>
