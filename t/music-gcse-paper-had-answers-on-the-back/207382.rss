As you know I and a few others are taking our GCSE exams (United Kingdom etc etc). One exam board was stupid enough to accidentally leave some answers on the back of the exam sheet. Full story here:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7414129.stm

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thousands of teenagers are facing uncertainty over their exams after a GCSE music paper was found to have some of the answers on the back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Luckily I was with the AQA board and not the OCR.

[b]Anyone had this paper? If so did you see the answers on the back?[/b]
