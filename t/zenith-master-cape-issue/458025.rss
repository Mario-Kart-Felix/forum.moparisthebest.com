    <title>Zenith Master Cape issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zenith-master-cape-issue/458025</link>
    <description>I am pretty sure this is both server and client sided. when i go to customize the cape and choose a color it glows at the bottom. but if I just wear it the cape does not glow. I have seen servers with this cape working. any suggestions how to fix this? (it has to be the right model; just something isn&#39;t telling it to refresh when you wear it.</description>
