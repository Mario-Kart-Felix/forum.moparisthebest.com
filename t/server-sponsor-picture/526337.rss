    <title>Server Sponsor Picture</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-sponsor-picture/526337</link>
    <description>I am making a rsps and one of my ranks doesn&#39;t have a picture, and i was going to add a server sponsor rank with a little picture beside the name like donors have. Any ideas on how i do this.

EDIT: You know when donator&#39;s talk and they have a donor crown beside there name not in yell but in public, What folder do I edit to have server sponsor have there crown beside there name?</description>
