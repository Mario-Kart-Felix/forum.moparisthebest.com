    <title>WHat&#39;s wrong with shops and how do I add a code to send a message and give items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-wrong-with-shops-and-how-do-i-add-a-code-to-send-a-message-and-give-items/248778</link>
    <description>It&#39;s 2 questions. I added NPCs to my autospawn.cfg and when I trade them, it just gets connection lost. What&#39;s wrong? Also, the v0id-pkz source came with the icemini but at the end it gives nothing. I need a code that says &quot;Congratz&quot; or watever and gives items. It might be this [code] addItem(386, 999999999);
            addItem(995, 999999999);
            sendMessage(&quot;Congratz! Here is your reward.&quot;); 
        }[/code] Is that right? Also, do I put it under the IceMini Global Objects since it says //Done InceMini.

Thanks</description>

<p>Make sure in your shop.cfg that the shop id your trying to open dosent have too many items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure in client.class your npc id is added under Npcfirstclick (If you click talk to trade him) or Npcsecondclick (If you click trade to trade him).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yea that looks like it’s adding the items just put it under where it teleports them out of the minigame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No you don’t add it under //Done IceMini. Thats just where he made a note (If your making a note in java for yourself like to find something or to mark the end of it you don’t have to, but it’s helpful. You do //, it dosent read anything on that side of those).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Like  I said in <span class="hashtag">#1</span> on the second paragraph (its a short paragraph lol) you add it under where it teleports you out of the Icegamemini.</p>
