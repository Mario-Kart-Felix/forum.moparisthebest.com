There are so many ways of doing what you want done. Perhaps people thought you had not shown enough effort to explain your problem, so they will not show effort in solving your problem.</p>
<p>Tell people WHAT you want to happen. They can point you in the right direction of what to look at and ways of implementing it.</p>

<p>I did explain at the start, but thought it’s useless and none knows, so deleted the post. What I mean by this is lets say , if a player is wearing for example “Zamorak Godsword”, he can’t attack players in wilderness. If its in the players inventory, then he can attack them, only if he wears it he can’t. And he can do everything else in wilderness, like attack wildy monsters etc…<br>

copy and modify the logic to control when a player has no arrows, the effect would be the same - just occurs in a different way :P[/quote]<br>
I didn’t think of this <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> but this is a good way of doing it. and very simple.</p>
<p>If you really can’t figure it out then Use this. But you have got to try first <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>[spoiler]Go into PlayerCombat.java. Search for the procedure</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Under the variable weaponid you could place this.</p>
<p><code>if (weaponId == 1205) {//Bronze dagger example
   player.getPackets().sendGameMessage("You can't attack players with a bronze dagger!");
   return combatDelay;
}</code>[/spoiler]</p>

<p>Go to WorldPacketsDecoder.java and search for “You can only attack players in a player-vs-player area.” or something along those lines.</p>
<p>then above the if statement this message is apart of place this:</p>
<p><code>if (player.getEquipment().getWeaponId() == 1205) { //bronze dagger example
   player.getPackets().sendGameMessage("You can't attack players with a bronze dagger!");

<p>Now it’s done, but to stop auto retaliate we need to go to CombatDefinitions.java and search for this procedure:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>And underneath it add this:</p>
<p><code>if (player.getEquipment().getWeaponId() == 1205){//bronze dagger example
   return false;
