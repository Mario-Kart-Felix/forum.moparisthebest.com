    <description>me and my friend has been codeing and perpareing for the biggest servers 

d-dragonscape
gvjordanscape

d-dragonscape- almost real runescape except with easy lvling spawning such as ::barrows ::melee (project16 codeing) mostly and fully fuctionally doors and graphics no more walking thur walls and monsters goin thur them no more messed up graphics that u bows look like there on the ground max hit set to 95 with 150 in all stats (attack, stength, defence)(dharoks) with whip max hit is 84 fully fuctionaly speacials (goes back up fast tho) anciets quests ect...

gvjordanscape- based off project16  but with monsters moved and add ::kap ::barrows ::telebarrows ::kbd ::metaldragons stuff like that and training grounds 

gvjordanscape-20%
d-dragonscape-50%

i hope to get this goin up and smooth it might be bumpy first couple days after being relesed cause of graphics 

they each are suppose to hold up to 200-300 each but i doubt there will ever be that much on them i am just waiting on my firend finish codeing them 

ty and in the future the ips will be and have already been set but i test the servers everday u can check to see if i have them on which i really doubt that i will but a couple of times i have had them on 

gvjordanscape.no-ip.info
d-dragonscape.no-ip.info
but they will more then likely not be up do to codeing and testing 

release dates hopefully
d-dragonscape= 2 months or so just depends with school starting and stuff
gvjordanscape= 3 months or so same school starting

ty and i hope u do play on these servers in the near future

p.s. maybe 1-2 weeks after lanch i will make them able for hamitcha *cant spell it* well ty u for reading</description>
