so pretty much if you cant see the claws are invisible and when i add model it says cannot be found. i put the .dat models in the &quot;Raw&quot; folder. there is no Models folder so thats why i put them there.
Everything that has to do with 11740 (dragon Claws Case or item code)

[code]		        case 11740:
                itemDef.actions = new String[5];
                itemDef.actions[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;
                itemDef.modelID = 44590;
                itemDef.maleEquip1 = 43660;//anInt165
                itemDef.femaleEquip1 = 43660;//anInt200
                itemDef.modelZoom = 789;
                itemDef.modelRotation1 = 240;
                itemDef.modelRotation2 = 60;
                itemDef.modelOffset1 = -1;
                itemDef.modelOffset2 = -23;
                itemDef.name = &quot;Dragon claws&quot;;
                itemDef.description = &quot;A set of fighting claws.&quot;.getBytes();
				break;
[/code]

i have tryed this guide: [url=http://www.google.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/tutorials/235346-pi-adding-dragon-claws-client-sided-pi.html]http://www.google.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/tutorials/235346-pi-adding-dragon-claws-client-sided-pi.html[/url]

i put this in itemDef in the client files
(i didnt put under /* Hardcoded items start here */)
because i looked at anoter pi client and put it where it was on that client( i tryed placing both spots)
(im talking about where i put the code above)

if you have any other guide or you k now how to fix that would be grate..
