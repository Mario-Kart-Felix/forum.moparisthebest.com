    <title>Apple Products are they really worth it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/apple-products-are-they-really-worth-it/219833</link>
    <description>Are apple products really worth it, because all i see is a device released with tons of glory then in 2 years they either ruin it or making it better. Like my old iPod Video that is a 5G version. They made a new version which the call Classic is bigger then the previous one. Is that fair?

I see no reason in getting the current iPod Video due to how it looks too much like their previous models</description>

<p>They don’t make the CPU, and I’m sure there are other pieces of Hardware not manufactured by them. The famous “Designed and Tested in California.” statement comes to mind. A lot of what goes into an Intel Mac now comes from the same factories as other generic PC’s.</p>
<p>I’ve had many problems with incompatibility in the past. Mainly because it’s a Microsoft game, and others find it hard to join along. I bought a Netgear 802.11g USB Wifi Adapter, that was Windows only. I didn’t read the box until after I bought it, and wouldn’t you know. Open Box policy.</p>

Exactly what i meant. iPods are so much easier to use than any other MP3 player i’ve ever seen. They’re also very organised and have other useful features.</p>

              <p>Hardware costs more from apple because people are willing to pay for it. It’s how apple advertises. People want exclusivity, and that comes with a price. That’s why you don’t buy RAM from apple. You buy it from Newegg, just the same as with any other PC company, you’re going to get a better deal somewhere else.</p>
<p>Macbook Air is missing quite a few features, and that’s for a reason. Read this article, <a href="http://weblogs.redeyechicago.com/iphoneblog/2008/07/more-on-the-clo.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. It does take some time to import 12,000 songs into itunes and convert it. It takes the same amount of time for any other media player that uses a library.</p>

<p>You’re talking about software companies. Apple has to sell hardware as well. The whole thing about Market Share is wrong. Apple has a small market share. And this iHell isn’t even a problem. I convert all of my songs(over 12,000) in itunes, plug my iPod in, and sync in. And I’m done.</p>
<p>You cannot put Apple in the same boat with Microsoft. They’re opposites. To try and compare apple and Microsoft is stupid. Apple does not wait to release products, in fact they let their community develop applications for them. Apple dominates when it comes to sales because they do what they do, the right way.</p>
<p>Apple has good products. I’ve never had any real trouble with them whatsoever. And to knock something without at least trying it is wrong.[/quote]<br>
Hardware from Apple cost more than other PCs with the same spec.<br>
If you try to upgrade RAM from Apple store it will cost you much more than upgrading a PC.</p>
<p>Macbook air, missing lots of things a PC should have and it expensive.<br>
Who care then about its fit in an envelope.</p>
<p>How long does converting 12000 songs take?<br>
If it takes more than 10 minnutes it takes to long time.</p>

You would never use Opera/Firefox if that Sucks, but lots of people use IE that sucks because they are to lazy the change, they don’t know that Windows and IE is opening Windows and door to let viruses come in to your system.</p>
<p>And Apple, most people uses their iTunes if they have an iPhone that also sucks, its hard to use and after that I have heard it only supports two formats (Correct me if I have wrong.).</p>
