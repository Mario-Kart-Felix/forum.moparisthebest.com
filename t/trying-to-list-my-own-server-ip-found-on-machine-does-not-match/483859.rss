    <title>Trying to list my own server. IP found on machine does not match</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trying-to-list-my-own-server-ip-found-on-machine-does-not-match/483859</link>
    <description>Okay so check it out, im hosting a server on IP address 205.237.129.6. I tried to list that server on moparcraft right?
It tells me to use a browser on my server machine and go to a link right?
So i got to that link on the server machine and it gives me this:
Error: 205.237.129.6 resolves to 205.237.129.6, which does not match your ip, 205.237.137.114.

No. the IP of my server has not changed. I can connect to my minecraft server just fine on the IP 205.237.129.6 and I&#39;m connected to the server machine where the minecraft server is running plane as day on 205.237.129.6. Now.... why does it think that my IP is 205.237.137.114?</description>

              <p>Do the entire process on the server machine, It might be using the IP which you made the request on, and not considering that you the server is being run on a completely different network.</p>
