Italy’s center-left leader Romano Prodi said Thursday he doesn’t fear a reversal of parliamentary election results, insisting his or her narrow victory is protected despite Premier Silvio Berlusconi’s demand for a recount.Prodi appeared the winner from the hard-fought election, although his / her razor-thin margin has brought back the prospect of political uncertainty in a country recognized for revolving-door governments.

"There’s the potential for governing for five years."Prodi said he had started talks on selecting a Cabinet, meeting with coalition celebrations earlier Wednesday.

"Since he controls every little thing, he doesn’t trust himself."In Italy, it often takes a few weeks to exhaust the treatments necessary for forming the government. In this case, the situation is further complicated because the mandate in the president of the republic, whom must give the bow to a new premier, finishes in mid-May. Current Us president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has indicated he would leave the task in order to his successor.Prodi once more ruled out the possibility of the “grand coalition” between right and left suggested by Berlusconi.“A grand coalition isn’t only extraneous to our program but it happens when no majority emerges in the elections,” Prodi said. "In this example, a majority came out."The political election results still must become confirmed by Italy’s maximum court, and parliament’s selection committees also will have to rule on any poll challenges.    no previous site next    1/2  <a href="http://betasbydre139.labeautesalonandspa.com/2013/05/29/beat-headphones-dr-dre/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">beat headphones dr dre</a></p>
