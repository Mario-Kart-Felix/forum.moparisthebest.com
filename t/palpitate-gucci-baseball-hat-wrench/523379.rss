    <description>A good X-ray revealed that Anthony had a widened growth plate as part of his shoulder. Known as &quot;Little League shoulder,&quot; the problem is most common between pitchers and other positions that require frequent and dynamic throwing.

Russia has given up on it&#39;s actually space mirror. The particular much-hyped experiment ended Fri when cosmonauts on the place station Mir sent your partially unfolded mirror to the Earth&#39;s atmosphere burning up. What was left dropped harmlessly into the Gulf of mexico. The 83-foot diameter hard drive was supposed to mirror a beam of sunlight to the Global surface. But its petal-like sectors refused to unfurl Thurs and attempts to un-jam it didn&#39;t work. Russian officers say another hand mirror is built, but there are no plans so far to place it into room. Scientists hoped that a huger version of the test reflect could bring added light to sun-starved upper cities.  The mirror had been supposed to work as an artificial moon, highlighting sunlight onto a number of regions on Earth. If the cosmonauts had been successful, accounts CBS News Writer David Hawkins, the reflection would have created a three-mile wide beam of light.The Russians hoped this would lead to a series of larger decorative mirrors to make the short winter days longer of their northern cities.As opposed to bouncing sunbeams to Planet, NASA prefers that this space program focus its effort on the international space train station - a $60 billion, 14-nation joint project. Russian federation is more than a calendar year late in completing a critical part of the place and the delay will be holding up everyone else. More lost time could cost Oughout.S. taxpayers vast amounts of dollars, but the problem is not hard: Moscow is almost broke. Russia performed a similar mirror experiment six years back, but the crew after that didn&#39;t try to control the mirror, plus it was barely seen even to those who recognized its exact situation.
