    <description>hey guys. I&#39;m really really bored.
I made a server it went well, but i couldn&#39;t make it 24/7. so no one really came on it. But i wanna help some one make a server. Like about a month ago, I was stuck on making server and I know how it feels just being stuck and you wanna be owner of server. When people came on to my server for the first time i felt joy in my heart it&#39;s a feeling i&#39;ll never forget.

Now i want to help you using team viewer.

This is what you will need:

Team viewer(obviously)
Admin on your computer
the password to get into your router
English computer (it dosen&#39;t matter too much though.

I will be on my computer all day untill GMT 00 3pm which is six hours from now.

Simply add my msn which is hezy12@hotmail.co.uk - so we can talk

ANY ONE WILL BE ACCEPTED.</description>
