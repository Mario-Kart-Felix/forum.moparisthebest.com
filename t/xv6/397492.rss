    <title>Xv6</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;xv6 is a modern reimplementation of Sixth Edition Unix in ANSI C for multiprocessor x86 systems. It is used for pedagogical purposes in MIT&#39;s Operating Systems Engineering (6.828) course. Unlike Linux or BSD, xv6 is simple enough to cover in a semester, yet still contains the important concepts and organization of Unix.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I thought I would post this in case anyone here is interested in learning some important concepts of the UNIX operating system. I myself have found deep interest in knowing how the UNIX operating system works simply by the taunting reputation it has appraised.
