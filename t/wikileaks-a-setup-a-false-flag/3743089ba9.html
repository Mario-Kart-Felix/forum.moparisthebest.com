<p>Extremists only make up a small part of a religion. But because of the ‘ways’ of an extremist, you only hear about them and not about the moderate religious people. Those extremists have two sides. One side is that they fight for their freedom. It’s a good thing, anyone would do it. You could, in a way, call resistance fighters in WWII extremists because they were using violence to get their territory back.</p>
<p>The other side of an extremist is that he wants to spread his religion. Don’t think it’s something only Muslims do, there are a lot of Christians (Jehova’s, but other streams too) that still try to convert people. You might think the US is a secular state, but most people outside the US see how much influence Christianity has on the US government. So when the US, perceived as a Christian country, invades a Muslim country, or supports a Jewish country in it’s struggle with Muslims, the Muslims will start to think of Christians and Jews as the enemy. This in turn sparks extremism. And that’s why I say that the US should get the hell out of Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Muslims and Jews in Palestina and Israel should stop whining like little children. And it would be best if Western nations mind their own business. It’s all perception.</p>

<p>I don’t want us to leave, Id rather the middle eastern countries’ start to advance and progress more into an actual country that benefits the world. Radeon told me one of Al Qaeda’s goals is to unite all middle eastern countries into one giant country. That would be great, but the chance of extremists coming into power and using that power to start a WW3 could be too great.</p>
<p>Leaving wouldn’t be good either. Even before we invaded the middle east had problems, and not only with us. What makes you think theyll stop?</p>

        <p>I say just do an American or free world equivalent form of government but just give them the whole islam thing to offer. But don’t force or punish people for not following the national religion, and don’t make official laws that are based specifically on islam. Like they have catholic and christian schools here, allow them to have islamic schools but by choice.</p>
<p>So dominant religion+freedom of religion.</p>

I’d like to see all religion abolished, personally. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I’m catholic because I was baptised at birth, but I’d be lying if I said I believed in their teachings. I’m certainly not a practicing catholic, that’s for sure… unless you count commercialised holidays such as christmas.</p>
<p>Anyway, the main difference with practitioners of islam and practitioners of catholicism is that the catholics have updated their interpretations of the teachings found in their holy book.<br>
For example, most catholics consider the book highly symbolic these days, rather than something to be taken literally.<br>
Muslims on the other hand have leaders who take the book literally, who issue fatwas calling for the killing of infidels, and so on.<br>

<p>Such a bullshit argument. On both sides there are people who take their holy book literally and people who take it as a metaphor. The ratios from what I can tell are basically the same.</p>

<p>But we can understand it. Only with the help of science, not religion. I agree with you though, but getting rid of religion is very hard. Until then, I think all religions, at least the three major ones, should be treated equally. That’s why I hate the general Muslim bashing, because it’s usually done by Christians and Jews.</p>

<p>They should abolish Islam altogether and establish an American style hollywood in Iraq! They can have all these celebrities that take drugs and everything. That’ll stop them from fighting back!</p>

<p>I’d like to see all religion abolished, personally. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I’m catholic because I was baptised at birth, but I’d be lying if I said I believed in their teachings. I’m certainly not a practicing catholic, that’s for sure… unless you count commercialised holidays such as christmas.</p>
<p>Anyway, the main difference with practitioners of islam and practitioners of catholicism is that the catholics have updated their interpretations of the teachings found in their holy book.<br>
For example, most catholics consider the book highly symbolic these days, rather than something to be taken literally.<br>
Muslims on the other hand have leaders who take the book literally, who issue fatwas calling for the killing of infidels, and so on.<br>
And that’s the big difference – while there are some fucking disgusting <span class="bbcode-s">catholics</span><span class="bbcode-b">christians</span> (eg, Westboro Baptist Church), the overall leader of the catholic religion, Pope Benedict, doesn’t call for violence or incite it.<br>

<p>But we can understand it. Only with the help of science, not religion. I agree with you though, but getting rid of religion is very hard. Until then, I think all religions, at least the three major ones, should be treated equally. That’s why I hate the general Muslim bashing, because it’s usually done by Christians and Jews.[/quote]<br>
I’d just like to point out here and now that I give jews a much harder time than I give muslims, both online and in the real world.<br>

<p>Stories in the majority of religions are very common to stories in other religions because they’re all part of the mythosphere. The mythosphere is important to developing people and civilizations. There have been studies that prove that this is critical to normal development. If you’re interested, then you look them up.</p>
