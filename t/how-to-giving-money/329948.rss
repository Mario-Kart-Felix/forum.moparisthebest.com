    <title>How to giving money?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-giving-money/329948</link>
    <description>My good friend scored his 6th or 7th set of claws again yesterday and he wants to give me 3m but neither of us know how we would go about doing this.

I was thinking buying a plummeting item for lowest in bulk and then sell it to him for trade price. At first i was thinking of whips, but he would lose alot of money doing that.

Any ideas?</description>

              <p>If he has plenty of money, buy an item that is close to rock bottom graph-wise, but not yet raising in price. Give it to him for mid price, rinse and repeat (until he has given you the money that he wants to give you).<br>
Once the item raises enough, he then resells it. This works fine if he’s patient enough.</p>
