    <title>RuneScape Crumble Undead Rewrite</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-crumble-undead-rewrite/542099</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m rewriting the crumble undead spell to automatically kill undead. I also want it to require a special staff, and use a special rune. 

Can anyone help me with that?</description>

and take into account if the npc is an undead one or not… lol</p>
<p><code>if (GET_PLAYER_WEAPON() == CRUMBLE_STAFF &amp;&amp; GET_ITEM_COUNT(CRUMBLE_RUNE) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; isUndead(npcID))
    DAMAGE = NPC_HEALTH;</code><br>
An increasing problem in the help forum is that noone ever posts their revision or base. If you were to want more detailed answers, PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION</p>
