    <title>Client won&#39;t connect to server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-wont-connect-to-server/465833</link>
    <description>Alright, I know I&#39;m going to get called noob and all that other stuff, but honestly I have followed every single tut there is, opened port forwarding using both my router and utorrent, but still my client doesn&#39;t connect to my server. yes I have changed the ip to my own, and even tried changing it to that of the no-ip. Basically I&#39;m stuck, can anyone help?

UPDATE:

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve portforwarded correctly and even turned my firewall off for a bit. I keep getting the J5connect error, even though my server is running. I&#39;m using eclipse 639 client</description>
