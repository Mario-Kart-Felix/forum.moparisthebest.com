    <title>NPC + Player clipping</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-player-clipping/437599</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to clip both the clippings for both Players and NPC, on my new source i&#39;m working on. Since when you go to attack a NPC you walk threw walls/buildings. And then the NPC&#39;s themselves, can walk threw, as if there was no wall there. And I looked up on the forums[Here] to see if there was a guide, and now i&#39;m looking to find help so that I can clip them both, so they don&#39;t walk threw walls. :) Any help would be nice...
