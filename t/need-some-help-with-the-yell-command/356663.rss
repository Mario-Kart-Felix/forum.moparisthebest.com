    <title>Need some help with the &#39;Yell&#39; command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-help-with-the-yell-command/356663</link>
    <description>All right I&#39;ve recently developed (other servers may have this, im not saying its original or anything like that) a new ::yell system. I saw something on a server&#39;s client.java and I went to create one like it, just making the size of the method smaller.
What I would like done is to make it so that when a player of certain Rights yells, the color of the text and etc. is different.

Here&#39;s the code I have:
Code:
[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;yell&quot;) &amp;&amp; command.length() &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0) {
                String titles = &quot;&quot;;

                if ((donator == 1) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &lt;= 0)) {
		    titles = &quot;[Premium Member] &quot;;
		}
                if (playerRights == 1) {
                    titles = &quot;[Moderator] &quot;;
                }
                if (playerRights == 2) {
                    titles = &quot;[Administrator] &quot;;
                }

 		if (playerRights == 0) {
                    titles = &quot;[Player] &quot;;
                }

                if (playerRights == 3) {
                    titles = &quot;[Co-Owner] &quot;;
                }
		
		
		if (playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;####&quot;)) {
                    titles = &quot;@red@[OWNER] &quot;;
                }

               yell(titles + &quot;&quot; + playerName + &quot;: &quot;
                        + command.substring(5));
        }[/code]
Okay so the problem is, when I yell as the owner, in the chat box it actually says &#39;@red@[Owner] :&#39; How do I make it change color</description>

<p>Though, the basic 317 client does not allow colored text in the chat box, unless you manipulate the client.</p>

<p>I quite understand why already but thank you anyways. I asked for what you think I should type in the search box. I don’t have a clue what I should put in. I’m searching colors in chat box. Would that work you think?</p>

              <p>It seems to work when I use it on Interfaces and such, but not with the yell system, think you could help me find it? I’m still using the search button but I wouldn’t know how to go about searching it. What would my search query be in your opinion?</p>
