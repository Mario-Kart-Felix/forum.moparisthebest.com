Please, do not flame me.

I would like to create my own base from scratch, however that&#39;s extremely hard for me, as I&#39;ve only learned Java by editing. I have tried looking over the login methods in different sources but could not make heads nor tales of them. If someone could kind of &quot;mentor&quot; me through starting off, I&#39;d be extremely happy.</description>
