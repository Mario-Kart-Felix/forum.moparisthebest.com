Why Choose RISE?

Here at RISE our main focus is the players because of the fact that we always
are looking for vouchers who can speak their mind about the server and have
constructive criticism about our server, because a server runs on the basis of
the development team along side the communication with the players! We
at RISE believe this is mandatory to be a success along side the ideas the 
development team have. All server&#39;s are unique in their way, however they
are never perfect, hence we chose the motto &quot;Where Dreams Become Reality&quot;.

Some Features of RISE:

- Working Godwars
- All Skills Working!

Influence Points

What are Influence Points?

Influence Points are the main Points you can earn in RISE. They are used to purchase special items from the Influence Point Shops.

What Items do the shops Feature?

The Shops feature items which can help progress all play styles, such as tools for Skillers, weapons and other equipment for PvM&#39;ers/PvP&#39;ers. Rune Boxes containing a certain amount of Runes for a spell. The shops also feature clothing to make your character stand out from the rest. We are constantly developing new things for the Influence Points Shop.

How do you get Influence Points?

In RISE, there are many different methods of gaining Influence Points. One of the basic methods is just being online, you receive a certain amount of Points every 30 minutes you are active in the server. You can also gain Influence Points by killing monsters, skilling, leveling a skill, killing players, completing Special Events, and Voting.
