IPBoard Forums!<br>

<p>Why Choose RISE?</p>
<p>Here at RISE our main focus is the players because of the fact that we always<br>
are looking for vouchers who can speak their mind about the server and have<br>
constructive criticism about our server, because a server runs on the basis of<br>
the development team along side the communication with the players! We<br>
at RISE believe this is mandatory to be a success along side the ideas the<br>
development team have. All server’s are unique in their way, however they<br>
are never perfect, hence we chose the motto “Where Dreams Become Reality”.</p>

<p>Influence Points</p>
<p>What are Influence Points?</p>
<p>Influence Points are the main Points you can earn in RISE. They are used to purchase special items from the Influence Point Shops.</p>
<p>What Items do the shops Feature?</p>
<p>The Shops feature items which can help progress all play styles, such as tools for Skillers, weapons and other equipment for PvM’ers/PvP’ers. Rune Boxes containing a certain amount of Runes for a spell. The shops also feature clothing to make your character stand out from the rest. We are constantly developing new things for the Influence Points Shop.</p>
<p>How do you get Influence Points?</p>
<p>In RISE, there are many different methods of gaining Influence Points. One of the basic methods is just being online, you receive a certain amount of Points every 30 minutes you are active in the server. You can also gain Influence Points by killing monsters, skilling, leveling a skill, killing players, completing Special Events, and Voting.</p>
