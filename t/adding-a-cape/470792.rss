    <title>Adding a cape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-a-cape/470792</link>
    <description>I added a cape to my server and I forgot to add the animation to it. So I opened it up in DatMaker and I went to add an animation, but didn&#39;t know which one to choose. Then I was wondering if I was supposed to be adding the animation in DatMaker, like you do with weapons, or if I have to add it in my source. Getting to the point.....do I use DatMake to add a cape animation, or do I have to code it into my server</description>
