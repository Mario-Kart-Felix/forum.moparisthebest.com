    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-advice-with-possible-gold-buying-scam/511811</link>
    <description>Alright so I bought 50m from rswalmart, every time I go into a live chat, the someone what English speaking person on the other end will type 1-2 things, disappear, and never show up again. Should I be patient, send an email, and wait? Or have I been scammed and need to move on?</description>

              <p>just a word of advice if you do make contact with them they are going to ask you to close the dispute, do not close it until you have the gold on your account and make them aware that you are going to keep the dispute open until after its delivered. if you close it you will nto be able to reopen it, they will probably ask you many times to close it because once you do and they decide to not fulfill the order you really have no resource other than to file a dispute with your bank or credit card company which tends to be a hassle.</p>

may i know w3hy u open the dispute?
You 03-29 16:35:08
Because all of the people I've talked to so far have dissappeared and have not responded back, you're the first person to acutally say more than one thing

If I could just get what I bought I'd be happy to remove the dispute and leave it</blockquote>
It's been 15min still no word. Like 6th time trying to talk to them.
