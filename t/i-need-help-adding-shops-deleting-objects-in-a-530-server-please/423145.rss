    <title>I need help adding shops &amp; deleting objects in a 530 Server please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-adding-shops-deleting-objects-in-a-530-server-please/423145</link>
    <description>Okay here is the server source + client I am using: Xenorune 530.
I can&#39;t find anywhere&#39;s online where to edit the shops or even to add or remove a object in this type of 530 server. It seems as if it is a rare game frame and very few people know how to use it. Whenever I follow a 508 or a 562 guide or even a 317 guide the files such as client.java and actionsender.java and frames.java are missing but there are other ones instead, such as objectmanager.java or shop-packets.java but they are all names and put together slightly different. If anyone can help me with this it would be greatly appreciated! I will Rep + to whomever walks me through this nightmare.</description>
