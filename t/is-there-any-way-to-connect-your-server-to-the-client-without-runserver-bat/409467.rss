    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-any-way-to-connect-your-server-to-the-client-without-runserver-bat/409467</link>
    <description>The title says it all. I have a PI server named brokenx v2 and i really want to have it up but who plays has to have my source file but that means they can edit there character and i thought about making a webclient but the tutorials dont make any sense to me. I have portforwarded port 43594 and it said the port was open but i have a cable connection to my modem but when i go to runelocus it says my server is offline. So Is There Any Way To Connect Your Server To The Client Without Runserver.Bat? Please help Fast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</description>
