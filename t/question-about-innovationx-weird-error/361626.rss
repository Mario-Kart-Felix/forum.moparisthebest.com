    <title>Question about innovationx.. weird error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-innovationx-weird-error/361626</link>
    <description>Really weird to ask I know, but most of the people out there are having issues with the client. The server is running fine with just me on my own computer (127.0.0.1), but when I enter my no-ip address, it doesn&#39;t seem to work. :confused:
At first I thought that something was just wrong with the client, but I soon discovered otherwise. The client is able to connect to other servers I have on my computer (old czar age stuff), but isn&#39;t able to connect to this one using my no-ip address. Has anybody run into this issue at all, or do you know how to possibly fix? checked my server class, and it&#39;s running on port 43594, same as the client. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Here&#39;s a video I uploaded showing utorrent&#39;s port check working for other servers on my computer but not this one.

And here&#39;s the link to the server I&#39;m using.
