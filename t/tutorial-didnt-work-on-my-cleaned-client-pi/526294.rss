    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-didnt-work-on-my-cleaned-client-pi/526294</link>
    <description>[center][size=12pt]First off, I&#39;m using the client from this thread: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,640976.0.html
And I used this tutorial: http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/snippets/470192-pi-tab-reply.html
I did everything right, I&#39;m 100% positive, don&#39;t suggest I didn&#39;t.

Any ideas?[/size][/center]</description>
