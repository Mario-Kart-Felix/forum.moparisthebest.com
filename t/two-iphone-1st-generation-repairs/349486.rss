    <title>Two iPhone 1st generation repairs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/two-iphone-1st-generation-repairs/349486</link>
    <description>Both of the digitizers are responsive but have wide cracks on the screen, except on one the power button isn&#39;t working. The main goal for me is to refurbish these dinosaurs and resell them. Would it be pricey to get the screens replaced? Would it be easy and cheaper to replace them myself? or should i just go ahead and sell them for parts?

Opinions please.</description>

              <p>LCD screens usually are pricey, i remember paying 30 euros for a 1.2 inch one for a SE T690 back in '05</p>
