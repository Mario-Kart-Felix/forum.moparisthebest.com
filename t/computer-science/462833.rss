    <description>Today, I went to a College Fair, which showcased many different colleges in or near my state. I took a look at many different colleges that offer a Computer Science course, but I came to realize that Math would be essential in these courses. I was wondering if anyone here is currently taking going for this major or would like to pursue this in the future. Also, does anyone have a general idea of what type of Math courses in high school are required/essential for Computer Science?</description>

              <p>I love math, all the courses that you need to take have already been posted. Try writing a Math API in a language of your choice, it can be quite fun, and it helps you understand the formulas more thoroughly.</p>

              <p>The only reason I ask is because I’ve slacked off in Math ever since my Freshman year; however, it isn’t because I don’t like it, because I actually think it is quite fun if you understand the steps required to solve a particular problem.</p>

              <p>I’m planning to major in some type of Engineering, I love math and always will. I actually visited a college fair today also and I’ve been thinking a lot about Technology schools. I would take as many math courses as you can in High School. Why? Its simple, you won’t be paying for in college, other math courses that you do take in college will come somewhat faster, and you won’t have to study the basics as hard. Right now I’m taking Calculus in HS and I’ll be taking calc again in college.</p>

              <p>Computer Science and Software Engineering both require a lot of mathematics. I am pursuing Software Engineering and only getting to the point of Analytic Geometry/Trigonometry in high school, leading into Calculus and Physics courses in college. It is recommended to take Calculus courses.</p>
<p>Try looking up your college and finding a Course Index or Recommended Courses page. They will generally give you a list of recommended courses.</p>
<p>You won’t escape math in Computer Science or a programming major.</p>
