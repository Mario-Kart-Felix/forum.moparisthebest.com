Thanks jme. That’s real nice. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I don’t think there is anyone on this forum who I don’t like… Well… If I met genodemon I’d probably shove his face into the ground for being asinine. Some other people come to mind. lol so I think 5 people I don’t want to meet, and everyone else I do. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
