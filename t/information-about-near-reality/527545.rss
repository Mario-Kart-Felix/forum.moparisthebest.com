It was the biggest server until the owner didn’t want to go through copyright crap, and the info on this server is going away.  So is Near Reality someones server…yea, but its not since it doesn’t exist anymore.  And I am asking a question about a “idea” of hp and drops for two certain npcs that would improve my server greatly and there is no way to contact the owner since I believe he is done with private servers and the only people that go on near reality is people that want to play league of legends and call of duty -.- so I’m probably going to get zero help from them</p>
