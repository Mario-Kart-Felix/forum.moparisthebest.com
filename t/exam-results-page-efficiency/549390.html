        <p>So basically, I have this online exam and this is where all of the results are done. Basically, how would I be able to improve on this? I think the code is sloppy and there would be a 100x more efficient way of marking this. Because by using the while statement it slows down the loading speed of the site by a fuck ton.</p>
<p>I’ll break the code down for you below:</p>
<p>Ok, so this bit, basically it searches through the database and gives you either 1 or 0, 1 if you’re correct 0 if you got it wrong. This is then used later on in the program.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for ($num=0; $num&lt;=$quizquescount; $num++) {
  $response2 = mysql_query("SELECT id, answer FROM questions WHERE category_id='$category' &amp;&amp; id='$num'") or die(mysql_error());
  $name = "quiz" .$category. "a";
  
  while($result2=mysql_fetch_array($response2)) {
        if ($_POST[$num]==$result2['answer']){
          mysql_query("UPDATE users SET ".$name."".$num." = '1' WHERE userid = '$userid'");
        } elseif($_POST[$num]!=$result2['answer']) {
          mysql_query("UPDATE users SET ".$name."".$num." = '0' WHERE userid = '$userid'");
        }
      }
   } 

  $right_answer = 0;
  $wrong_answer = 0;
  $unanswered = 0;

  $total_questions = $right_answer + $unanswered + $wrong_answer;

  $response = mysql_query("SELECT id, answer FROM questions WHERE category_id='$category'") or die(mysql_error());

  while($result=mysql_fetch_array($response)) {
       if($_POST[$result['id']]==$result['answer']) {
               $right_answer++;
           } else if($_POST[$result['id']] == 5) {
               $unanswered++;
           } else {
               $wrong_answer++;
      }
 }</code></pre>
<p>Ok, now this bit basically sorts the data so that they can be categorized. So basically the first row of the array might be category “Test1” and the second one would be category “Test2”. This is so students can get marks like literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>And the reason I use a switch was so that ever different exam has it’s own categorys for example one might use “Test1” “Test2” and “Test3” as the categorys. Where about the other one uses “Test4”, “Test5” and “Test6”.</p>
<p>[code=php]$user_score = mysql_query(“SELECT * FROM users WHERE userid=’$userid’”) or die (mysql_error());</p>

<p>Please ask me if you are unsure about anything. PS I know the code is trash, I just mainly short cutted it and now I regret it cause it slowed down the loading speeds and just makes me feel horrible when I look at it. I guess I could add all the $arraysorts information into a database but that’s about all I can think of thanks.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>You’re STILL using mysql_* functions. They have been deprecated since you were still shitting your pants and your parents wiping it all up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even with using those disgusting mysql_ functions you’re not even protecting yourself from SQL Injection.</p>

<p>So after telling you about this at least twice before, why should we bother wasting our time helping you with your projects if you’re not going to fucking listen? I hate this fucking forum it’s full of autistic fucking moronic pricks</p>

        <p>Instead of running an update query for each result inside your while, you should be able to store all the updates in an array to then update each entry in one query after the loop, or at least group them so you aren’t sending out as high of a number of queries.</p>
<p>Listen to everybody and what they’re saying about mysqli, you wont see major performance upgrades here without actually going out of your way to learn about atleast mysqli, and PDO. But if somebody with malicious intent catches wind of this thread, or see’s it in a google result and somehow works out the URL where these exams are, you’re gonna have a bad time. There’s a reason absolutely nobody has stood up for your use of mysql functions.</p>
<p>It’s very, very old code, do you want to be left behind by the year 9 who gets taught this shit at school? I know when I was in year 9/10 I was messing around with SQLi and actually remember breaking into my old HS’s website <span class="hashtag">#fuckmrleary</span></p>

<p>It happens now and again old friend.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span> towards your question about efficiency. Think about programming logically, as you would anything else. If cars these days were sold on the question of “does it work?” then we’d be dying a lot more frequently. Thankfully, the main question most people ask themselves is “Is it safe?”. Think this way in programming. Don’t worry about micro performance and how quick your script is when it’s not safe for use.</p>
<p>Get yourself in that state of mind and you’ll go further.</p>

<li>
<p>You’re STILL using mysql_* functions. They have been deprecated since you were still shitting your pants and your parents wiping it all up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even with using those disgusting mysql_ functions you’re not even protecting yourself from SQL Injection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So after telling you about this at least twice before, why should we bother wasting our time helping you with your projects if you’re not going to fudgeing listen? I hate this fudgeing forum it’s full of autistic fudgeing moronic pricks</p>

<p>So basically, if I fixed up all of my mysql, it would not only speed up my site it would protect me from SQL Injection? Honestly the only people who will be using this site at my school are Year 9’s whom would be around 12-13 I can almost guarantee they wouldn’t even know what sql injection is… And is the rest of the code fine? the way I use the while statements to update information.</p>

<p>How long will this script be in use for? PHP 7 which comes out in November of this year will be <span class="bbcode-i">most likely</span> (happily) removing the legacy MySQL driver you are using. Yes I said removing–completely.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s only going to be used for the first few months of this year, I will change over to PHP 7 when it’s released. But this thread wasn’t just about the mysql…</p>

<p>Looks like you’ve proved Ruby correct.<br>

<p>It happens now and again old friend.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span> towards your question about efficiency. Think about programming logically, as you would anything else. If cars these days were sold on the question of “does it work?” then we’d be dying a lot more frequently. Thankfully, the main question most people ask themselves is “Is it safe?”. Think this way in programming. Don’t worry about micro performance and how quick your script is when it’s not safe for use.</p>
<p>Get yourself in that state of mind and you’ll go further.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ok, I totally agree… that safety is more important but honestly, this is going to be used for the first 2 weeks of school and then it’s going offline till the next year. Right now safety is the least of my worries with the amount of time I have. I have a few days to get this thing up and running it’s all ready to go, it’s just the performance isn’t too fabulous right now… throughout the year I will learn Mysqli.</p>
<p>[quote=“stCky, post:10, topic:549390”]Instead of running an update query for each result inside your while, you should be able to store all the updates in an array to then update each entry in one query after the loop, or at least group them so you aren’t sending out as high of a number of queries.</p>
<p>Listen to everybody and what they’re saying about mysqli, you wont see major performance upgrades here without actually going out of your way to learn about atleast mysqli, and PDO. But if somebody with malicious intent catches wind of this thread, or see’s it in a google result and somehow works out the URL where these exams are, you’re gonna have a bad time. There’s a reason absolutely nobody has stood up for your use of mysql functions.</p>
<p>It’s very, very old code, do you want to be left behind by the year 9 who gets taught this shit at school? I know when I was in year 9/10 I was messing around with SQLi and actually remember breaking into my old HS’s website <span class="hashtag">#fudgemrleary</span>[/quote]</p>
<p>There is no chance of this happening because it’s going to be hosted locally throughout the school for about 2 weeks. I know what you mean about even a down syndrome could ruin this site. But atm that’s the least of my worries.

<p>Yeah this was the idea I had in mind as well, would this be the only way I could improve the performance?</p>

<p>This would be a very good start. Querying the database is a relatively expensive operation.</p>
