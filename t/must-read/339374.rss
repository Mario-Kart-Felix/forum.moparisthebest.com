    <description>I know this may get locked before many people read it, but it should be said.

Ok this is just to much now, look in the tutorial section before you post, a lot of the questions that have been asked are covered by a tutorial. If you read the rules, it states that you must show that you have tried to fix your issue, also this isn&#39;t a spoon feeding community, meaning stop asking people to, do it for you over team viewer, tell you were to put the code exactly, to give you the most detail so you have to do less work. 

Just follow the rules, you will learn faster and learn better this way. I suggest you go to the &quot;Tutorial List&quot; in the tutorial section, read the Java section of that list (It is at the bottom of the topic), it will help you gain knowledge that you can use so you can solve your problems.</description>

              <p>We have been trying to enforce people to use the search bar and stay away from spoon-feeding for awhile. It was highly enforced awhile back, but it kind of dwindled down because of nobody following it.</p>
<p>Feel free to report the topics, as they can be legitimately locked most of the time. We let a few of them slide. Usually a moderator will always look at a report and do something to the thread, unless on an occasion where they feel it can pass.</p>
<p>Thanks for making the topic though, but as the others like it, it will have to be locked.</p>
