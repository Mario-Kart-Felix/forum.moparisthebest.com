    <title>[PI] How to add a shop that buys anything?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-how-to-add-a-shop-that-buys-anything/431624</link>
    <description>Hi,

I was wondering if you can remove objects on PI. I&#39;m at a place with crates and stuff and I want to remove them so I have some flat room. I know that you can add stuff like banks, mining rocks, etc. in ObjectManager.java but those crates and stuff are not listed there, so where can I find those? Is it even possible to delete them?

Thnx in advance.</description>
