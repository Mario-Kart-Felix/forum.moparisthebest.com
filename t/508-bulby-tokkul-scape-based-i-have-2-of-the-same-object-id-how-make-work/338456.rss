    <description>ok in my slayer tower there is the same object id 2 times in the tower.

there is 2 doors that are the same id but on different levels, and when i click on it it teleports me to the upper floor when its suppose to be on same floor just in other room. how do i add [code]case 10529:
p.setCoords(3445, 3555, 2);
break;[/code] but for hightlevel 1 and hightlevel 2? so i can change coords for the 2nd hightlevel? isnt is something like..

[code]case 10529:
p.setCoords(3445, 3555, 2);
break;[/code]

all i know is i have to say that that that case =&#39;s the hightlevel 1 door, then make the next case =&#39;s the hightlevel 2 door.</description>
