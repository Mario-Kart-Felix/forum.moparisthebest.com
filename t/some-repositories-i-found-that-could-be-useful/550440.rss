    <description>Need something to manage your server instances, need an easy way to ship and deploy your server?

https://github.com/docker/docker

&quot;Docker is an open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container&quot; (Docker Github)

maybe with, https://github.com/rancherio/os
and coupled with https://github.com/rancherio/rancher

Want to write a simple login server that isn&#39;t integrated into your current source?

https://github.com/grpc/grpc

Similar to https://github.com/twitter/finagle

Others

https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix

&quot;Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.&quot; (Hystrix Github)</description>

<p>wow, docker is cool. not sure why I’ve never come across that before… deploying VMs is a pain in the dick</p>

<p>I’m thinking of writing a simple Runesource docker image then a tutorial explaining how to launch it on a micro amazon ec2 instance with rancher. Then you could ‘host’ a server for free, and in 5 minutes or less.</p>
