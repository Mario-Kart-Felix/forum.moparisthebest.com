    <description>hey im relatively new to coding ive just been teaching my self over the last couple weeks. on the server ive been working on ive been trying to add a second jail for a solitary confinement. just an idea i had but ive been trying todo it for a while and it wont work :( i copied the ::jail command i coded and changed the name of the command and the coords and that made it so whenever i used the command it said &quot;that name doesnt exist&quot; which is the else {. 


this is my jail code. 

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;jail&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 0) {
                try {
                    String otherPName = command.substring(5);
                    int otherPIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(otherPName);

                    if (otherPIndex != -1) {
                        client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];
                        p.toX = 2933;
						p.toY = 3285;
						p.action = 1;
                        p.sM(
                                &quot;You have been jailed by &quot; + playerName);
						sM(&quot;You have jailed &quot;+p.playerName+&quot;.&quot;);
                    } else { 
                       sM(&quot;The name doesnt exist.&quot;); 
                    }
                } catch (Exception e) { 
                    sM(&quot;Try entering a name you want to jail..&quot;);
                }
            }[/code]

this is what i did trying to make my confinement zone.
[code]
if (command.startsWith(&quot;confine&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {
                try {
                    String otherPName = command.substring(5);
                    int otherPIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(otherPName);

                    if (otherPIndex != -1) {
                        client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];
                        p.toX = 3999;
						p.toY = 3945;
						p.action = 1;
                        p.sM(
                                &quot;You have been put into solitary confinement by &quot; + playerName);
						sM(&quot;You have confined &quot;+p.playerName+&quot;.&quot;);
                    } else { 
                       sM(&quot;The name doesnt exist.&quot;); 
                    }
                } catch (Exception e) { 
                    sM(&quot;Try entering a name you want to jail..&quot;);
