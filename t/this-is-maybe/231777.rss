              <p>Well said (storm). I actually haven’t noticed it being a whole lot worse since my time here like 2 years ago. Few things that I have noticed that have changed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Almost like no respect for people of really high ranks (People Saying Shit About Miss Silab, Even After All Shes Done)</li>
<li>The rules are strict as hell now. But I guess it may have been needed.</li>
<li>There seems to be a lot more people who just cant spell, at all</li>
<li>Seems to be a lot more java newbs (yes, newbs, not noobs)  :rolleyes:</li>
</ol>
<p>Just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt.</p>
