    <title>EasyRSC connecting to other clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/easyrsc-connecting-to-other-clients/403788</link>
    <description>I have EasyRSC and the server connects to the client correctly. I download an RSCD v25 client which looks identical to the original RSC client, however, when I run the server and login with the client, it says it is logging in for some time and then says there is an error connecting to the server. However, I can tell that the client can detect the server as if I try to login without running the server, it instantly gets the error. With the server running, it takes some time for the error to appear. I have had this following problem for a months and I think I should accept that I can&#39;t figure it out. If you could help, I would be greatful. I would need a fairly detailed tutorial.

Note: The client does not have settings.ini</description>

This should fix it.</p>
