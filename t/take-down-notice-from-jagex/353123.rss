Yeah, I know this might be in the wrong thread but ChaosScape.net is the site that I&#39;m assume they are talking about?

<p>additionally, add to your TOS that “you also agree that you do not play any jagex game, and are therefore not subject to their TOS or any other agreement with them” (from mscp/mitb’s tos), that way you can tell them that no one within your community is subject to their tos and cannot be held accountable for breaking them</p>
