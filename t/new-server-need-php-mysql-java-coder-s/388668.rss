    <title>New Server Need PHP|MYSQL|Java Coder (s)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-server-need-php-mysql-java-coder-s/388668</link>
    <description>Name : ImpulsePK (We might switch names later on)
Status: Server Still In Beta Mode

Owner (Me) : Imtiax

Coders:  The Slayer (Java)

What we need?

- We&#39;ve designed a user panel on our website but then previous PHP Coder  left for boarding school unexpectedly so we&#39;ve been stuck since then.

- Basic stuff like user name changing, password changing, membership, all from a website page


You will also be given developer rank in game which would give you your own crown as well as some powers.

Our goal is to launch hopefully by the end of this week but that would mean that everything would have to be completed.

If you are interested
