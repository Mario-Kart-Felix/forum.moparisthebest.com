    <description>Hello everyone,

Im want to make a new server with many features and nice people.
So im looking for 1 or 2 people who want and can help me with developing a server and keep running it. If you want to help you must have experience with coding in java. I&#39;ll arrange the hosting for the server and of course i help with developing the server.

Greetings,

Yohurt / Bas</description>
