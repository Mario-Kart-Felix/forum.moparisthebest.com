    <title>PkedIsle ...(Not much)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pkedisle-not-much/223407</link>
    <description>This is what I&#39;ve did so far from my rs2e source, it won&#39;t be much to ya&#39;ll  but it means the world to me since I know I didn&#39;t leech this and it&#39;s actauly mine.

I&#39;ve been working on it and so far I have some of these things.

- In the original rs2e you could mass &quot;::addxp # ######&quot; And get over 10k  in a stat like so 10000/99, I made a ::master command that only works once, creds to Hidendra for helping ~.^.

- I removed ::bank and replaced it with bankers around.

- Working on making a full varrock, shops etc, I have the npcs placed :).

- I also made a command for making people admin\mod, and a kick command. Before only one person could be mod\admin, the char files are in .dat and serialized to where you can&#39;t read them.

- Working on full edge, I have a mage that takes you there from Varrock pk spot, but it&#39;s not 1 vs 1 yet..;(

- Added new shops and working on kbd respawn in wildy in aggressive mode :).

 Yes, I know it&#39;s not much but this isn&#39;t a normal wL lame server unstable lags at 20 people, I can&#39;t find any tuts for working on this, so gimmie a break.

Hidendra was like the best help most creds to my edits to him, he helps alot but I get on his nerves :P.

Here&#39;s a pic of some of my testers, I didn&#39;t post server on ss yet but i have like 11 people who always play. I&#39;m working hard and I know atm it is fail.
