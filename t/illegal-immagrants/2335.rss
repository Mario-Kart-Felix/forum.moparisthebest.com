    <title>Illegal Immagrants</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/illegal-immagrants/2335</link>
    <description>Just curious, how many people think that people comming into your country (illegally) about a year or so after a huge monument got blown up is not safe?

And on top of that, what do you think about the people who protest about that they should be let in because if we dont, you are being racist? Acknowledging that you here illegally to save your illegal family from being deported into your old government.

and on top of that, what do you think of the illegal people who try to reform their new country (which they&#39;ve been smuggled into (illegally!)) to accept them in because they have the right when they could be in their old country helping thousands more have the freedem they have in their new country instead of absorbing up all the taxes that non-illegal people pay?

Just curious, some of you dont give a damn, but to those who hat terrorism, what do you think?</description>

              <p>I may as well not debate as my opinion has already won. I am really pissed about the stupid illegals. In my opinion, of you get here legally, then welcome to America. Anyways, the other day at school, about 50 kids walked out and walked to the capitol of my state (it wasn’t too far), and protested about the American government not giving ‘rights’ to illegal immigrants. It really pisses me off that they illegally cross our boarders, drain our society, all because they are too lazy to replenish their own government, and they complain? I think we have the right to be lazy, because we did the hard work of building our governent in the first place, and the illegals are running away from their problems, and leaving for America.</p>
<p>Am I racist? No. I don’t care if your white, brown, black, or yellow, if you are illegal, then you have no right to be here.</p>

<p>F*** all you Racists. omg the only freakin reason that there illegal immigrants is because their home country sucks. they come to america looking for a job to support their fammiles and i swear. Mexicans work 100 times harder than any american… they dont start out in the real world with money from their parents. They have to f***ing work for their living… they start with nothing they come to america living in the worse neighborhoods and work and work until they make something of themelse. not only mexicans mid-eastern, anyone in general they come to a different place to work to send someone back to their country that has no work or has a corrupt goverment is inhumane. </p>

<p>not to mension that that is why we are all getting obease (dont know how to spell, sry) because all of use Americans cant get our frikn asses off the couch or out of the car and actually work with our own two hands.</p>
<p>with their hard working powers, they can actually overthrow their stupid power hungry government (btw, half of mexico cities population is all children under the age of 5, why? because their parents flee to start a better life.)</p>
<p>How do they get into the US? they <em>SNEAK</em> in, as in espionage right there. anyone sneaking into a different country without permision of the country is considered espionage because they can gather information very easily and just blend in with the other illeagles. Racism? no, Biast? no, Worried about another terrorist attack? yes.</p>

              <p>Well, it’s alot easier for South Koreans to get to this country legally than Mexicans, because they have sponsors here and save enough money to get here. Mexican (and south americans who come through mexico) are poor and don’t have sponsors in the US. Ironically, Mexico is one of the richest nations in the world in terms of its national resources. Maybe the illegals should stay in their home countries and get jobs there, to improve their own economies, instead of draining ours. What if Mexico could compete with the US for jobs from Korea?</p>
<p>It won’t happen, because the government of Mexico is more concerned handing out guides on how to cross the border (<a href="http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1339129/posts" rel="nofollow noopener">http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1339129/posts</a>) and influencing American immigration policy (yahoo news deleted the article…this is a google cache): (<a href="http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:lkitNhVqC70J:news.yahoo.com/s/ucgg/20060403/cm_ucgg/mexicosplanputsamericanvaluestothetest%3B_ylt%3DA86.I1.cDkRE40gACgUBgMIF%3B_ylu%3DX3oDMTBidHQxYjh2BHNlYwN5bnN0b3J5+mexicosplanputsamericanvaluestothetest&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow noopener">http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:lkitNhVqC70J:news.yahoo.com/s/ucgg/20060403/cm_ucgg/mexicosplanputsamericanvaluestothetest%3B_ylt%3DA86.I1.cDkRE40gACgUBgMIF%3B_ylu%3DX3oDMTBidHQxYjh2BHNlYwN5bnN0b3J5+mexicosplanputsamericanvaluestothetest&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;client=firefox-a</a>)</p>

              <p>PaulT, I think your answer is the best in this discussion, at least in my opinion.<br>
One thing is that stress is being put on immigrants from South and Central America, yet Koreans are known for their skills in a lot of jobs. Check out Korean scripting (meaning hacking/cracking), it’s crazy good.</p>

<p>They are a huge strain on healthcare and economy because a large portion of them don’t pay taxes or don’t work at all and just get social security. Their children enter our schools, they use our healthcare services and they don’t speak english, clogging these systems and costing us millions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our government wastes billions of more dollars on other things that are fucked up, so I don’t care if we’re wasting money on the immigrants in healthcare and schools. Hell, I we can even pay for then, it’s a better use of our tax dollars than the war on drugs or the war for oil. I’m more concerned on the effect the illegals have on the wages of people who work in shitty jobs.</p>

<p>F*** all you Racists. omg the only freakin reason that there illegal immigrants is because their home country sucks. they come to america looking for a job to support their fammiles and i swear. Mexicans work 100 times harder than any american… they dont start out in the real world with money from their parents. They have to f***ing work for their living… they start with nothing they come to america living in the worse neighborhoods and work and work until they make something of themelse. not only mexicans mid-eastern, anyone in general they come to a different place to work to send someone back to their country that has no work or has a corrupt goverment is inhumane. </p>

              <p>It’s not a strange concept that we only let certain people immigrate here. Sorry, we can’t just accept anybody. We want people with skills. Plenty of people are willing to scrape shit and rake lawns, as long as illegals don’t drive down the wages. Yeah, no Americans will do the jobs, because the illegals make the wages absolute shit pay. By the time we deport them the middle class will be fucked anyway. It’s an invasion. But who cares. Maybe they’ll bring weed with them.</p>
