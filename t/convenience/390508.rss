    <description>Have you all ever realised how much we pay for convenience? For example, at my school they sell Hot Pockets in the lobby for $1.75 each. For a box of 12, it&#39;s like 5-6 dollars. So if you go to a store and buy a box, each one costs between $0.42 and $0.50. But instead of going to the store, and getting a box for $6, with enough for about 2 weeks (one for breakfast every morning), they would rather pay the $1.75 because they don&#39;t have to go anywhere.

I don&#39;t know, just something I noticed.</description>

Now this made me laugh. A hotpocket isn’t going to cost $1.20 more because they aren’t buying them in bulk. It’s simply because they are reaping the profit to the fullest capabilities. They know the kids won’t buy hotpockets and bring them in, so why not raise a few dollars for the school in the process?</p>
<p>Yes, you do have a point though. The reason that Wal-Mart has such low prices is because they buy say 20 million cans of Monster for usually 60 cents. They can tell the company that produces Monster to sell the cans to them for 50 cents a can instead. Monster really has no choice, because they will still be making money and also selling 20 million cans. That is how Wal-Mart puts all of the little, family-owned businesses out of business.

<p>And then the happy stay-at-home-mothers with the hard-working husband and the two adorable children (one boy, one girl) living in their own nice little house in the suburbs becomes sad.</p>

You’re right, but wrong. VAT’s <span class="bbcode-b">are</span> a reason for the higher prices, but they’re insignificant. About buying in bulk and whatnot: you’re obviously correct to a certain extent because not buying in bulk ramps up the marginal cost quite a bit. You’ve got the idea, I guess.</p>

<p>yeah talking economics here. The reason it cost’s much more in Cafes and Schools etc etc. is because you pay alot of VAT (value added tax). In supermarkets, stores you don’t pay as much VAT on your goods, because they brought it in bulk which costs far less to begin with, therefore they can afford to sell it cheaper. Schools and cafes don’t buy things in bulk which is much more expensive, therefore they have to make things a little more pricey to make up the lost profit.<br>
As for runescape economics, i have no idea. L2P i guess.</p>

A “convenience store” (they’re all 7-Elevens where I live) charges you more not because you have no choice, they’re literally 50m from supermarkets in the city here. They charge more because they are more convenient (marginally, and they’re prices are more than marginally more expensive) they also charge more because supermarkets get cheaper goods in the first place.</p>

              <p>[quote=“zyle1992, post:1, topic:390508”]Have you all ever realised how much we pay for convenience? For example, at my school they sell Hot Pockets in the lobby for $1.75 each. For a box of 12, it’s like 5-6 dollars. So if you go to a store and buy a box, each one costs between $0.42 and $0.50. But instead of going to the store, and getting a box for $6, with enough for about 2 weeks (one for breakfast every morning), they would rather pay the $1.75 because they don’t have to go anywhere.</p>
<p>I don’t know, just something I noticed.[/quote]<br>
So… What you do is buy the box and cook them in the Faculty lounge, then sell them to student for $1 each.</p>
<p>profit???</p>
<p>When I was in High School, kids would sell Mt. Dew cans for $1 - $2 each. My friend made a couple hundred bucks a week.</p>
