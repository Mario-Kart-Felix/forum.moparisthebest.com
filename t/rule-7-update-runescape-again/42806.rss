    <title>Rule 7 update:RuneScape(AGAIN!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rule-7-update-runescape-again/42806</link>
    <description>Yes it&#39;s true,clients like &quot;swiftswitch&quot;(or whatever it&#39;s called)are now illigal in RuneScape.
1.Programs such as these have a chat room feature which contains alot  of people aiming to break rules on RuneScape out of the official servers.
2.Some features that are built-in to these clients have links to un-safe sites and can steal your password on RuneScape.

This ofcourse affects rule 9 &quot;Encouraging others to break rules&quot; and Jagex ofcourse enforces these rules.So now clients like these can probably get you banned and/or muted for advertising them,or using them.

Discuss about it here ^^.</description>

Na, just the added features like the high scores… It’s basically good because Jagex fail to provide their own calculators etc on their own website. Stupid if you ask me, especially since they know the precise mathematic formulas behind all of the levels and stuff.<br>
But you know, Jagex are more worried about the shit elements of the game that a minority care for.<br>
Anyway, if Jagex was smart they’d make an additional high scores thing in-game, much like that found in servers… You just right-click, and boom, instant high scores on your screen. Of course, they wouldn’t come up with this idea, so then Strider includes it in SwiftSwitch, along with an IRC client and some other stuff, and tada, instant success.</p>

No it’s not against the rules. It does not give you an unfair advantage in any way (real or implied), shape, or form. Therefore, the client cannot and is not against the rules, as I have spoken with Jagex MANY times on this subject.<br>

The only way for them to find out is to run a scan of your computer’ patition, which would be hacking, and otherwise illegal. Hacking, refers to getting one’s information/data without their consent, so unless RS says “press ok for us to check/scan for swiftswitch on your computer and ban you if we do find it.” I doubt they’d do it. Also, AFAIK Java can’t see what processes you’re running without the installation of a seperate API/Library…</p>

<p>"What type of third party software is NOT allowed?</p>
<p>This includes, but is not limited to the following third party programs:</p>
<p>Programs that attempt to communicate directly with the RuneScape game worlds.</p>
<p>Programs that monitor, modify or decrypt the communications between the RuneScape client and the RuneScape worlds.</p>
<p>Programs that generate input to the RuneScape client. This includes programs that automatically move the mouse pointer or generate mouse clicks or key presses.</p>
<p>Modified versions of the RuneScape client. Reverse engineering the RuneScape client is strictly prohibited. Using a modified version of the RuneScape client is not permitted.</p>
<p>Third party programs/websites that embed a pane displaying the RuneScape game within themselves (i.e. third party RuneScape clients such as world switchers) must not be used to access the game unless that program/website does nothing to encourage breaking of our rules and does not endanger users’ accounts. In any case, the use of such programs is not recommended. <span class="bbcode-b">Authors creating such software may wish to read this article for advice on how to make a third party client which does not encourage rule breaking or endanger users’ accounts.</span></p>
<p>How does the new macro detection system work?</p>
<p>Our new macro detection system monitors activity on our servers and detects suspicious behaviour. This evidence is reviewed by our team of experts who either confirm or reject the systems analysis. Jagex will not reveal the exact mechanics of how this system works because this would make circumvention easier."[/quote]<br>
yep i’m gana go talk to jagex to find out how to make a client :), maybe we should tell them how to do it.</p>

<p>"What type of third party software is NOT allowed?</p>
<p>This includes, but is not limited to the following third party programs:</p>
<p>Programs that attempt to communicate directly with the RuneScape game worlds.</p>
<p>Programs that monitor, modify or decrypt the communications between the RuneScape client and the RuneScape worlds.</p>
<p>Programs that generate input to the RuneScape client. This includes programs that automatically move the mouse pointer or generate mouse clicks or key presses.</p>
<p>Modified versions of the RuneScape client. Reverse engineering the RuneScape client is strictly prohibited. Using a modified version of the RuneScape client is not permitted.</p>
<p>Third party programs/websites that embed a pane displaying the RuneScape game within themselves (i.e. third party RuneScape clients such as world switchers) must not be used to access the game unless that program/website does nothing to encourage breaking of our rules and does not endanger users’ accounts. In any case, the use of such programs is not recommended. Authors creating such software may wish to read this article for advice on how to make a third party client which does not encourage rule breaking or endanger users’ accounts.</p>
<p>How does the new macro detection system work?</p>
<p>Our new macro detection system monitors activity on our servers and detects suspicious behaviour. This evidence is reviewed by our team of experts who either confirm or reject the systems analysis. Jagex will not reveal the exact mechanics of how this system works because this would make circumvention easier."</p>

<p>SwiftSwitch is pretty shit in my opinion. But I guess some people like it. =S</p>
<p>Oh, and to the other person saying you couldn’t use other clients from the start, it’s half true.<br>
Originally the only types of clients that were against the rules were those that could bypass the waiting time that occurs when you change worlds. They weren’t welcome. Now none are welcome, but who really cares. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Well, to get back on topic - I’ve seen sections of the pmod forums, because someone saved them and uploaded them to their own hosting. I’m sure the only way they detect this will be the same as the only way they can detect people using ad blockers - If the person admits to it in-game. There are several rules like this; so I doubt there is any <em>serious</em> chance of actually getting caught.<br>
That, and no they weren’t against the rules originally; although Jagex are morons, and some of the staff told people they were completely alright, while others told people the complete opposite… I guess it’s good that they’re all back on the right page. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
