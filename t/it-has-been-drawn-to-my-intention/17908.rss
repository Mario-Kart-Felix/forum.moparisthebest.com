    <title>It has been drawn to my intention</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/it-has-been-drawn-to-my-intention/17908</link>
    <description>It&#39;s ben drawn to my intention, that Moparscape.org/moparisthebest.org has just became one big flame war. Arn&#39;t we supposed to be a community? Every forum I see latly, unless it&#39;s posted by Xero or Miss Silabsoft, some in-experienced coder gets flammed when asking a question. Like, they are MoparScape&#39;s future. If you agree, please &quot;sign it like a petition&quot; and hopefully we can get a rule about flamming.
No doubt I&#39;ll be flammed for this, but I don&#39;t care.</description>

Actually, there is a word called intention[/quote]<br>
Yes, but in this case it’s ‘attention’ because even though they are both nouns, intention, is what you want to do with something, and your attention is well, your attention…</p>

zomg NO WAY MANZORS…<br>
yes correct their is a world called intention, and their is also a word called attention.<br>

<p>When mopar used leet hax on php, and seperated the forums(this one and <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a>) One of the FIRST threads in the question section was “LOOK HERE FOR ALL THINGS RELATED TO MOPARSCAPE/PRIVATE SERVERS”. It told them to ask them at <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>. But no. Even with the terms and conditions, people STILL ask moparscape questions in the question section.</p>
<p><a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a>, <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> BOTH have 2 search buttons. Both have stickys, BOTH have terms of serice but no, if people ignore these then the topic is really un-needed.</p>

<p>“where is client.java” duh work it out and also there must of been 10s of posts about this and they havent bothered looking</p>
<p>“i have javac problem” there are loads of tutorials for this and once try searching</p>
<p>some people i beleive play runescape/ find out about pvt servers, come on here even when there younger then 13 ( if i can remember correctly you have to be 13 to join?) and they just act totally stupid</p>
<p>but some of the times they do need help that isnt to nooby and people just flame them, this is what i think is bad</p>
