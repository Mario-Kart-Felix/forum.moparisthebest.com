    <title>Decomposing Client Sprites</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decomposing-client-sprites/376660</link>
    <description>Currently, I am trying to rework the client to not load any sprites for the GameFrame whatsoever. Make it back into a simple Java GUI.

There is one problem, however.

I can not find a SINGLE instance of any jButton, jPanel, jLabel, anything.
The one thing I did find was a jFrame, but that led to nothing useful.

Any help on where I can find these things?</description>
