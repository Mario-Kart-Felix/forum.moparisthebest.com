    <title>Error on Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-on-server/173752</link>
    <description>I have followed the &quot;creating provate server tutorial&quot; by God twice and have followed all steps...
I have enabled my server phalanxreqiuem.no-ip.org with port 43594 and opened it in network connections...I have no-ip running...I have local host runserver.bat file running...I am logged in...I have portforwarded  43594 port with belkin router...Why is my server still not working when my friends try to log on?

Do I have to create a server.bat file that runs my ip in no-ip or something???

Someone please help...I beg of you...One who helps will be awarded on my server</description>
