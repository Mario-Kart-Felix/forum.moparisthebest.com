Constructive criticism is appreciated, but please don&#39;t be too harsh with me. I know that each and every one of these are very sloppy and could use a load of work. I rushed through all three of these.</description>

The focal point was rather skimmed through, the depth lacks character, the lighting is a little displaced. On the second one - there’s too much openness going about and it’s kind of plain. The third one, as you said, could have been a bit darker. The first one could have used a better focal point, the rendered slightly more to the left, the depth more in-depth, and that splash of yellow at the bottom right is unnecessary.</p>
<p>[quote=“AtomicInt_, post:3, topic:520772”]Holy love you still exist. Nice job, man.[/quote]Thank you. I have been actively posting for a couple days now. I plan to be more active. I’m no longer participating in RuneScape emulation, though I am going to be actively posting in the general boards, and lurking in all the rest.</p>
