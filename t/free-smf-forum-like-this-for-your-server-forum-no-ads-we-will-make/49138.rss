    <description>I make good smf forums (like this one)
It is the same layout. Different Theme. I thought it might be good for people with servers that want a forum that is easy to use because they have had prior Xp with a forum.

This is how i will do it:
Send an email or Pm me. (email moparscape.forums@gmail.com)
In that mail, please include:
Your Server name (I.E earthscape)
The Title you want your forum to have
What other features you may want.. (Eg: The Karma (Rep) System.)
Email Address
And username you would like

After i finish making it, i will send you a email with:
Username &amp; Paswords (you may change them)
And a brief note of what to do and how to edit it.

I have made some of the big server forums for people. (www.earthscape.co.nr)

I hope this helps you and makes your server popular. Thanks
