    <title>A Giude For New Server Makers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-giude-for-new-server-makers/187294</link>
    <description>Ok I Made My Very First Server Last Month, Well it wasn&#39;t really mine because its leeched but it was start i guess :| the easiest way to make your server is by using a hamachi based one, if you dont know where to get hamachi or you dont have the program another link is provided here..

[url=http://forum.ragezone.com/f364/release-download-list-release-breath-333792/]http://forum.ragezone.com/f364/release-download-list-release-breath-333792/[/url]

This also has a [b]HUGE[/b] list of sources you can download to start you server, the link for hamachi is given close to the bottom of the topic, the process for downloading shouldn&#39;t take too long, but be patient because it may..

Now then you have your source and you have hamachi now this is next of what you need to do, you know that ip at the top of the hamachi screen? Well thats going to be the ip for your server, but wait! There is more to be done... You need to create a network for people to join, if no one joins this no one can play, so i suggest advertising it on YouTube Or on The Mopar hamachi server status&#39;s ([url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/hamachi.php]www.moparisthebest.com/hamachi.php[/url]) now you have the network setted up you can now run your server! now it should be accessable for everyone to play! There Should be a file in your source that says &quot;Runserver.bat&quot; double click and leave it on or else the server cannot be accessed! Here Are Some Of The Clients You Can Play It On

[url=http://www.client.silabsoft.org]www.client.silabsoft.org[/url]
[url=http://www.moparisthebest.com]www.moparisthebest.com[/url]

I Hope This Helped You In Some Way, If You Want To Edit It More Then Look Through Your Source And See WhatYou Can Do, Some Of It Reqiures JDK 5.0 or Higher..</description>
