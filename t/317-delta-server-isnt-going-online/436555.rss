    <title>[317-delta] Server isn&#39;t going online...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-server-isnt-going-online/436555</link>
    <description>OK, I&#39;ve followed The Soul&#39;s tutorial on how to setup a private server and make it online. I used No-IP DUC, portforwarded and all that jazz... I&#39;ve setup and made a private server successful work but that was a couple years ago so my memory is a bit off.. I even went into my firewall and allowed exceptions to the ports of my private server.. In my No-IP DUC I&#39;ve turned the host on, I&#39;ve set my env. variables up and my classpath/path, all that bull.. But still when I go on a server status checker and see if the server is online.. It says that the server is offline.. I followed the guide step-for-step, but still, close but no cigar. I can&#39;t really explain the problem that I&#39;m having but I&#39;m trying my best to.. Any ideas on something I may have missed? :\

[b]Edit:[/b] Also, I&#39;ve set my client up to connect to my server ip (rssimilar.no-ip.info) and made the port in the client to the exact port that my server&#39;s source is using but still no cigar... What&#39;s the problem?</description>

              <p>are you using the IPV4 address on the portforward settings?</p>
