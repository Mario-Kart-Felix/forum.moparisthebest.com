    <title>This is what i think</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-is-what-i-think/190127</link>
    <description>   Tons of kids come on these forums looking for help with there server, im not a kid but can say that i ask for help a lot too... Java isn&#39;t one of those things i was ever taught in school.  Matter of fact the internet wasnt really that popular when i was 16..  I feel that the same questions i see on these forums are a result of miss communication from the creators of this server..  Where are the stickies in the help forums so people wont ask the same questions over and over.. A lot of people on here have a huge ego, but i think that ego comes from the process of this forum..
   Example of that is the ranks... and reps..  So someone who just joined these forums sees a &quot;Senior&quot; member with high rep number and think oh hey i bet they would know how to fix my problem..  But its not that way, its more in the lines of &quot;noob read tutorials&quot;  the term NOOB is such a lack of intelligence mostly because majority of the kids on these forums once or still play runescape.  And you see that word everywhere.. ITs not like irl when ur at school, you don&#39;t call people noobs.. If anything with someone with high intellect about computers would be called a &quot;nerd&quot;. or a &quot;geek&quot;...  Thats why with the knowledge that ive learned creating my own server, im always happy to help out people, even if its a simple question..  Also i see a lot of senior, or community members, that say these forums are going down...  Shouldn&#39;t bitch about people just learning java or making a new server, u should bitch to the creators of this server that has allowed, all the same questions to go be posted over and over..  So maybe make stickies with the common questions and the answers that we see on these boards...  thanks[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 16, 2008, 05:23:59 PM[/size][hr]nobody agree&#39;s with this?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 16, 2008, 06:15:04 PM[/size][hr]Are you guys to lazy to read this.. to sum it up we need stickys on most asked questions...</description>
