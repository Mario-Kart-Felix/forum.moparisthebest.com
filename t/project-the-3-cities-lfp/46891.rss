    <title>[project] ==The=3=Cities=LFP==</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-the-3-cities-lfp/46891</link>
    <description>Hello i feel that i have got use to Java and the posibilties and have decided to start a brand new kind of server range.

[u][b]The Idea[/b][/u]
We have the 3 cities on the East side of the map  (Varrock, Falador, Lumbridge). There are the 3 bases. Now when a new player logs in they are apointed a city and a cape.
           Lumbridge  =  Guthix
           Varrock     =  Zammorak
           Falador      =  Saradomin

Ok the next bit. Each city would be a safe zone, (i have drawn up which bits will be safe zones) but everywhere else is a player killing area aka &#39;the wild&#39;. In each city it will have personalized shops with different names e.g Lumbridge = lumbridge general store. There shall also be in each city the usual bank and also a training area (up to asigned person where). If you have any other questions or suggestions on the idea just post it.

Ok next the images.

-NOTE- The RED boxes are a rough guideline for the safe zones.

OTHER posibilities
== Have shops in cities to only allow people from that city to access
== If you die the cape of your city is still on your back (can&#39;t remove)
== Can&#39;t attack people with same cape

Ok thats is all of plans. I am looking for able people to help on this. HERE are the following jobs::
City safe zoneing (one for each city)
-
-
-
NPC and Shop adding (possibly 2 per city)
-
-
-
-
-
-
Cape stays on player and can&#39;t remove
-
Maybe Extras (Teleports.. Spawns)
-
-
-

[b][i][u]NEW JUST THOUGHT OF IT![/u][/i][/b]
We need a code so when you log in you go to one of the 3 (wether it be random or equal)(equal is better)

[size=20pt]Ok if anyone likes the idea, wants to help or has suggestions please post i would love feedback---Applying to do extras help you must state your ideas---[/size]</description>

              <p>Lol, you should be able to fix the Safe zones yourself i think, the npc’s shouldn’t be any problem as well, same with the shops, only thing might be “hard” are the capes. I may take a look at it.</p>

I’m very good at coding, but i’m not sure this is the thing most people would like to help code. Top coders want a challenge. They want something they haven’t coded before. This is a basic. People can do this within a day or two. I’m sorry but i’m not sure if i’m going to help.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
