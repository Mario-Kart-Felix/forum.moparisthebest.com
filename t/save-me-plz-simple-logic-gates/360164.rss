    <title>Save me plz; Simple logic gates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/save-me-plz-simple-logic-gates/360164</link>
    <description>ok there are two questions. one i was able to do so which is fairly easy, since it had only two variables and one output.

Design a circuit that has two inputs (x and y) and one output (f) that functions in the
following way: the function f is false (0) when x and y are the same, and true (1)
when they are different.

my answer: [IMG]http://i55.tinypic.com/2v1rrbb.jpg[/img]

and its fine now comes this question:

Design a circuit with three inputs (a,b, and c) and three outputs (f1, f2, and f3). The
first output (f1) should be true (1) whenever the number of 1’s in the three inputs is 2.
The second output (f2) should be true (1) whenever the number of 0’s in the three
inputs is 1. The third output (f3) should be true (1) whenever the number of 0’s in the
three inputs is 3. In all other cases, the outputs should be false (0).
Optional: using all of the gates available, can you build a cheaper implementation
(using fewer gates and/or wires)?

this is what i did:

as you can see i am now stuck for drawing the logic gate, and stating what the function is equal.

even if three var i am ok, but it is three output.

Important question: for which do i draw logic gates for as you know for the first question i drew when f=1, so for second question, which do i draw gates for, (should i draw for any that has a one in it?)


Thank you in advance</description>

              <p>well, i got it now. yea i wasn’t sure if i had to do it for all out puts of f and !f. then drew the logic diagram and built it and tested it worked.</p>
