<p>You wouldnt believe how much spam and flameing the staff does clean up, until you view the mod log, we all do our best, but also have regular lives too…</p>

</aside>
<p>I can completely agree with mopar on this.  I have noticed there have been some new mods added to the originals and that shows that moparisthebest is aware of the issue.  As he said, many people have their lives to worry about and cannot spend all day on the forum.  As an administrator from <a href="http://kaitnieks.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">kaitnieks.com</a>, I have experienced this problem.  At the time I was granted moderator status and later administrator status, the existing mods and admins seemed to not be doing a fantastic job.  Not that I hold that against them or anything, but a person can only do so much with their time.  Many of the mods and admins were older people that had jobs and relationships to deal with so when you’re not working and such, “working” on a forum isn’t at the top of your list of priorities.  As the forum became even more active and became even more of a mess, kaitnieks brought in a few more people that did a wonderful job.  At the peak of the whole Aryan blitz, it was difficult to keep up with it all.</p>
<p>I understand how much work it is, I have been there.  And when mopar selects a new person for mod, people complain.  Example: Miss SilabSoft.  I didn’t take part in the private servers and have no interest in ever doing so so I didn’t see much of what she had to offer.  I’m not talking about knowledge of java or the server or anything runescape/cheat related at all.  I’m talking personality.  I was surprised to see her as a moderator, but I’m not as active here as I used to be so I couldn’t judge.  But everyone else seemed to have something to say about her.  Now that she is a moderator and she has been all over the forum, I can see mopar made a great decision in choosing her.  She is a mature person and that is what is needed.  That is how Kaitnieks selected his, and mopar is doing a great job following his example.</p>
<p>When I first joined this forum, moparisthebest offered me my old administrator position back as he did with all of the other Kaitnieks mods/admins.  Some had their mod status upgraded to admin as they didn’t have as many admins at the new forum (Kaitnieks, Dylock, myself).  I kindly thanked him and declined.  I know how much work is involved and I know I wouldn’t be able to live up to the title.  You’ve got to remember, runescape is a game for 10-14 year olds.  This forum is, for the most part, catering to the needs of those people.  When kaitnieks shut down, a lot of the “useful” people just stopped runescape entirely, the “useless” people came flooding on over and many more of those people have recently found the forum.</p>
<p>And about the flaming, <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,3.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,3.0.html</a></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>We respect each other and other communities. We don’t flame each other or other communities. We don’t fight on forums.</li>
</ol>
<p>With as much flaming as you have done against rule, genodemon, and impsoft in general, your chances of becoming that Mr. Pwndy are slim.  If mopar was to make you a mod now, it would pretty much mean he encourages people to pick on/flame them.  And that would probably anger ruler, and as he said in a previous thread I can no longer find, he acts irrationally when he’s angry.  I don’t know what he meant by that, but when a male says “irrational” I assume it means penis -&gt; anus.  Hopefully that’s not the case.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>one thing that wont help is you and other senior and community member’s spamming and flameing yourselfs, I think if you guys cut it out, it would give a better impression to the noobs who would learn by example and not spam or flame themselves, try it out <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>maybe you should learn to read?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>No, mopar is right, I’ll take a few examples, Xerxes, ruler, GenoDemoN, at times these people may flame each other a bit, now Xerxes is famous for this, all 3 of them are community members. A noob probally thinks “oh coolies community members do this so I willz!”. I’m not flaming them, it just seems we should set a better example.[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree. Xerxes i find one of a kind though, He did alot on Kaitnieks and only all of a sudden developed this flaming behavior though as i understand encouraged by ruler for stealing his scripts. Nearly every single on of Xerxes’s posts make me laugh.</p>
<p>It’s likley that when we first joined and used forums we did the same. The only way it could be resolved is closing forum regs or making the search button so big that blind people could see it.</p>
<p>Newbs eventually learn but by the time they have, new ones come, you get tired answering the same question. Why not when someone posts a question that has already been answerd 999 times, just simply say, use search button, or, leave the post completly and not answer.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Pwnd, post:1, topic:6321”]For the past six hours of so I’ve been a complete dick to some noobs.  I’m doing this for some obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Now, I know I’m not the only one who thinks this forum needs an entirely large reformation.  We have to many people disobeying rules (Me including, but for the good of the community, if you know what I mean).  This includes not doing simple tasks such as searching before posting a question that takes up an entire thread, reguardless of the thread three or four threads down in the list obtains the answer.  I’ve noticed this has been going on because of the carelessness of Mods and Admins alike.  We need to enforce rules.  What’s the point in having them?  Unless, of course, they pose as a template that you should kind of follow.  Even with this given, no one follows the rules.</p>
<p>Here’s my justification for what I’ve been doing:</p>
<p>[quote=Uniquely_Defined of BWH]For me, I’ve always liked to have the “hardass” poster. I’ve always liked to have a couple of people that I can almost gaurantee will flame me if I say something stupid. <span class="bbcode-b">It makes me think before I post.</span> <span class="bbcode-i">The problem is that for many a person, this is too daunting of a task.</span> Thusly they gang up with an overall undercivilized, low-intelligent, bottom of the barrel group that agrees with what they have to say. They now hate this character. One of the best things that ever happened to this board (besides c0ke and rum) was having nickolay moderating these boards. Another great thing that happened was saren posting. Sure, sometimes…well, all of the time, his posts are vulgar, crued, and may seem unnecessary. However, they’re not. <span class="bbcode-i">You can expect that if you say something truly idiotic, you’ll be flamed for it. That’s the glory of it.</span> <span class="bbcode-b">It causes you to strive for more</span> instead of depriving your intellect of knowledge that it rightfully wants and deserves.</p>
<p>If people think the boards are better off without the “hardass” posters, they’re seriously mistaken.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m just hoping example is taken from the other ‘noobs’ that have already paved the path to idiocy.  And if you come up with, “Pwnd, how do you expect us to moderate the boards to that fine of a filter?”  Hell, mod me.  I’ll clean this fucking place up.  Nothing’d be out of place.  I also seem to act more mature with authority.</p>
<p>I hope I didn’t offend people that weren’t intended to be offended.  I’m only trying to get a point across, one idiot at a time.[/quote]</p>

With as much flaming as you have done against rule, genodemon, and impsoft in general, your chances of becoming that Mr. Pwndy are slim.  If mopar was to make you a mod now, it would pretty much mean he encourages people to pick on/flame them.  And that would probably anger ruler, and as he said in a previous thread I can no longer find, he acts irrationally when he’s angry.  I don’t know what he meant by that, but when a male says “irrational” I assume it means penis -&gt; anus.  Hopefully that’s not the case.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

<p>Again, I don’t want to be mod, but if I was ever asked, I’d take it up.  I have no life, I’ve probably been on the forums for more time than Mopar (Joke, I don’t know if it is true.  I’ll check xD).[/quote]<br>
never done anything to you so how could you get mad. However you get jealous and have to leak my work because its better than yours.  You blame my work for inhibiting the popularity of your own work.</p>
<p>I am sorry i guess i direct alot of my hatred against people on this site toward you.</p>
<p>I don’t like miss silabsoft for cracking and releasing my aryan derived bot called slave.<br>
I don’t like mopar for not punishing miss silabosoft after he told her not to do it again and she did it again.<br>
I don’t like mopar fot letting my scripts be all over the site and not one ever being deleted and possibly instructing staff not to delete them.<br>
I do like mopar starting my scar obfuscator.<br>
I don’t like Waffendennis for banning me on codestream due to hurting his sbot3 second time around sales.  I released slave which had a mouse compable to sbot3.<br>
I don’t like Waffendennis for letting my sbot3 scripts, accessormethods and scheduler programs being part of his secound time around rip off.<br>
I am ok with starblaster now.<br>
I don’t like pwnd for talking so much shit, calling me a ripper, and helping someone sell my sbot3 scripts at a disconnect rate, and trying to charge me back after sbot3 died for the scripts, he was the only that tried.</p>
<p>I don’t like regex because he a nazi.<br>
I do like regex for allowing me to sell scripts after i started.<br>
I do like pd for his refractor, his respect of my walktotile(), and letting me sell aryan so long as i added useful things to it.<br>
I don’t like richyt for assisting waffen with sbot3 second time around, calceling old auths, and not giving me a free auth after writing so much code for it, also for abounding the community on a moments notice.</p>
