[B]About us:[/B]

[LEFT]Katagon is a 464 server that has been in the works for some time now. Our aim is to provide all types of players with an enjoyable experience. Whether you prefer new school or oldschool, skilling or player-killing, we&#39;ve got what you want. Our inspiration for the style and layout of the server came from 2010 era BattleScape, which was a popular server that in our opinion successfully combined player-killing and economy aspects of the game in tasteful way.


The gameserver is based on a highly developed version of Hyperion, which is a stable, well-written source developed by Graham. Our server&#39;s stability is very important to us and we&#39;re always working on making sure that latency is kept down to a minimum. Moreover, we&#39;ve spent an equivalent amount of time smoothing out the gameplay and ensuring that it feels genuine to the original game.


We&#39;ve chosen to use the #464 protocol with the Paragon client released by Leanbow. The client is one of, if not the most advanced publicly available client to date in terms of customization. You are given the option to select which data you would like to load(464, 530, 562 or 602), as well as many other toggles such as x10 hits, new hitmarkers(464, 554, or 634), new hp bars, new context menus and so much more. The real gem of the client is the fact that it allows you to toggle OpenGL to render the game in stunningly beautiful high definition(see: media).

[SPOILER=Fullscreen Media]
This has never been done on a 400-500 client before.

Surprisingly, the hardest part was trying to figure out how to clip the minimap as a circle in OpenGL, especially since the openGL used in &lt;2008 runescape is outdated and doesn&#39;t have certain methods to use(stencil buffer).

Quality is shit in these pics but oh well.

Fullscreen in HD(634 hitmarks also work perfectly with critical and correct font cache):

Fullscreen in LD with corrected field of vision(thanks to Akzu with a few edits):

Resizable works flawlessly and resizes all components to the screen size, including the inventory tabs collapsing on top of each other if the screen size is too small:

This.</p>
<p>And if you really want criticism, why would you choose such a boring training spot like yaks? Horribly overdone and completely lame. Besides that and client versions being interchangeable, you haven’t shown much to comment on. You also haven’t really given a development aspect  to this thread at all, you have not posted any goals or what your guys’ vision is as the server progresses.</p>
