    <title>EU Bans claim that water can prevent dehydration</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eu-bans-claim-that-water-can-prevent-dehydration/422224</link>
    <description>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/8897662/EU-bans-claim-that-water-can-prevent-dehydration.html

&lt;blockquote&gt;EU officials concluded that, following a three-year investigation, there was no evidence to prove the previously undisputed fact.
Producers of bottled water are now forbidden by law from making the claim and will face a two-year jail sentence if they defy the edict, which comes into force in the UK next month.
Last night, critics claimed the EU was at odds with both science and common sense. Conservative MEP Roger Helmer said: “This is stupidity writ large.
“The euro is burning, the EU is falling apart and yet here they are: highly-paid, highly-pensioned officials worrying about the obvious qualities of water and trying to deny us the right to say what is patently true.
“If ever there were an episode which demonstrates the folly of the great European project then this is it.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>You also seemed above to be intending to ban these things altogether, rather than just control how they are portrayed in advertising and by the people who practice them, which is silly imo.</p>

By this definition from Wikipedia it excludes anything that is proven to work as “alternative”.<br>
And it “alternative medicine” by this definition EU should ban “alternative” as a medicine.</p>
<p>It is like the water, you shouldn’t be allowed to claim something that isn’t true. I wonder if you were allowed to make that claim if you called the water “homeopathic”.</p>

<p>If I read that correct, dehydration is a symptom, not a disease on its own. If that’s right, then the ban isn’t all that bad. They can still sell water, they just can’t claim that it is a cure for something. It would be similar to banning the claim that water cures cancer (an extreme example).</p>

<p>This is just BS. The European Parliament isn’t the institution concerned with battling the current crisis, the European council is. Sure, they probably discuss measures, but the majority of decisions is made by the heads of state in their meetings. This is a common tactic among populists, they sketch a doom scenario which makes the MEP’s (he’s one of them!) look like fat old well payed nitpickers.</p>

<p>EDIT: Besides, it’s simply untrue that alternative medicine with proven efficacy becomes mainstream medicine. There are plenty of examples of things that have been proven to work, are used in medical settings and yet are still “fringe”. Hypnosis, for example.</p>

<p>I mean, its pretty well known that water is not a cure for dehydration. True dehydration involves electrolyte imbalances too, and chugging pure water at that point is likely to make you a lot worse. Also, their issue was with the fact that water is no BETTER at preventing dehydration than any other drink. Everyone knows we have to drink - but it doesn’t matter what you drink, really.</p>
<p>But yes, it’s a stupid waste of time to discuss. The people who submitted it basically did it just to make a mockery of the system, though, so who’s the time waster here? The EU or the people who submitted the stupid request?</p>
<p>EDIT: As for “deny us our right” - whoever is quoted there apparently didn’t read the thing at all, since it specifically says that no action is required by member states.</p>

<p>Brussels bureaucrats were ridiculed yesterday after banning drink   manufacturers from claiming that water can prevent dehydration.</p>

<blockquote>EU officials concluded that, following a three-year investigation, there was no evidence to prove the previously undisputed fact.
Producers of bottled water are now forbidden by law from making the claim and will face a two-year jail sentence if they defy the edict, which comes into force in the UK next month.
Last night, critics claimed the EU was at odds with both science and common sense. Conservative MEP Roger Helmer said: “This is stupidity writ large.
“The euro is burning, the EU is falling apart and yet here they are: highly-paid, highly-pensioned officials worrying about the obvious qualities of water and trying to deny us the right to say what is patently true.
“If ever there were an episode which demonstrates the folly of the great European project then this is it.”</blockquote>
