    <description>Server Base: 317 PI
Error: Server lags all user&#39;s when 2 people do a trade.
Reason: Unknown

Okay, I was trading a user to find out a item stats. I realized that was what was causing the lag on the server. I would like to try to fix this issue. I don&#39;t know what I should look at, or where it would be located. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s server sided due to the servers lagging. Does anyone know the issue causing this?</description>
