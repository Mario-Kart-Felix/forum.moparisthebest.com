    <title>Stream to coax and/or broadcast NTSC/ATSC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stream-to-coax-and-or-broadcast-ntsc-atsc/420508</link>
    <description>Basically, what I want to do is be able to output something (either the screen, or a movie file, etc) in a standard either NTSC or ATSC format so a TV on the other side of the coax cable can turn to a certain channel and be able to watch it.  What I&#39;d really like to do is be able to broadcast these so any TV within, say, 100ft, could get them over-the-air, but a coax cable would be acceptable.

I haven&#39;t been able to find any results on google, because whenever I search for anything related to &#39;linux&#39; and the words &#39;broadcast&#39; &#39;NTSC&#39; &#39;ATSC&#39; or the like, it is all just about receiving such broadcasts, I haven&#39;t found anything about sending them.

One possible solution could be a graphics card that outputs to either composite RCA or s-video, hooking that into a RF-converter which would then send that signal out on either channel 3 or channel 4, but I&#39;d really like to control the channel from software, and ultimately be able to broadcast on multiple channels simultaneously.

Does anyone know of any hardware and/or software currently capable of doing this?  Or have ideas to get me started creating my own?</description>

<p>That might be possible over ATSC, certainly not over NTSC.</p>
<p>[quote=“Newty, post:3, topic:420508”][quote]<br>
Find a old video card that has a composite output and get a stereo 3.5mm to RCA cable. Connect them to a VCR input. Connect the TV out from the VCR to a amp. From where your cable service comes in place a coax switch to choose between cable service and your VCR. When switched to your VCR it should play your your computers output is to channel 3 or 4. I’m guessing the picture will look pretty crappy.<br>

<p>That is the same as I mentioned, just using a VCR as the RF-convertor.  The quality should be the same as regular broadcast TV (not the new digital stuff).  The same limitation applies though, only 1 channel and it has to be 3 or 4, no others.</p>
<p>edit:<br>
Looks like this is probably what I want:<br>

Input: MPEG-2<br>
Output: ATSC over RG-6 (Coax)</p>
<p>But I don’t even want to imagine how much they cost, I may give them a call for shits and giggles later though.  I wonder if anyone has came up with an open-source Linux-based solution for that, I just don’t know about the hardware side of it.</p>
<p>edit2:<br>
This might be the ticket:<br>

Oh shit, nevermind, it costs €   1.495</p>

              <p>OK, I’m a novice when it comes to something like this but I did a little bit of research and I found: <a href="http://bellard.org/dvbt/">http://bellard.org/dvbt/</a> but he hasn’t released the source code and by the looks of it never will.</p>
<p>I continued searching and I found: <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/">http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/</a> which looked promising to me but I’m not sure if that is quite what your looking for.</p>
<p>I also found:</p>

<p>Still not satisfied with the answers I had found I continued to search and I found this thread which contains what I deemed to be helpful information (not sure how helpful it would be to you…)</p>

<p>Anyways, hopefully at least one of those links helps you out. If you do end up figuring it out I would love to see some type of ‘walk-through/tutorial’ on how you did it so I could attempt it in the future <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
