    <title>[PI] Drops/Drop Rates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-drops-drop-rates/392995</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I know this is posted A LOT, but even after searching, I haven&#39;t found what I need.

Okay, so I was testing how to change drops/drop rates. So for my test, I used my Tormented Demons. Here&#39;s the code I used:

[code]
#torm demon
1155:100	15027:100
[/code]

15027 is dragon claws. From what I&#39;ve read, this SHOULD make it drop 100 dragon claws, 100% of the time. Well, I saved it, compiled, then ran my server. It doesn&#39;t drop anything.


Am I doing something wrong?</description>
