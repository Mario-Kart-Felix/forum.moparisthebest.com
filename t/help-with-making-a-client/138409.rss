    <title>Help with making a client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-making-a-client/138409</link>
    <description>I am really starting to get mad, everytime I think I have it solved, theres another problem. Can anyone here post a guide for making a pretty up to date client or post a link to a guide? And don&#39;t post &quot;how to make a basic 317 client&quot;

It doesn&#39;t work... 100 errors...

Someone please help !~!~!</description>
