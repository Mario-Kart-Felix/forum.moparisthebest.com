<p>You should do some research on how the internet works and what it exactly is.<br>
After you get a general idea of the internet, you should learn about basic networking (server, client,…). If you do all of this, you will have an idea of what an IP is, and what we can do with it.</p>
<p>I’ll explain and IP in short for you. An IP-address, is basicly the address of your internet. Imagine if the internet you pay for was a house, then it would have an address. That address would be the IP-address. When you visit a website, play a server, the owner can see your IP-address.<br>
When you open a server, for people to play on, or a website, they have to type in the adress of your internet, in order to connect to your internet for playing on that server you opened. Try putting Jagex’ IP in your browser, it will open their website. It’s just the address, so that your computer knows wich “house” to visit for getting data.</p>
<p>When you know the adress of a house, you’re pretty much nothing with the address alone, because you can’t just break into the house with knowing the address only. Having the key of that address on the other hand, would mean something else.</p>
<p>That key could be anything really, for example, it could be information about an FTP server for that IP address, wich gives you access to for example the website files of the HTTP server. Yes both of those are servers like RSPS servers. FTP runs most of the time on port 21 and HTTP on port 80.</p>
<p>Imagine the internet being all the houses and stuff, and the guys making sure that everything is connected with eachother so that one IP can connect to another for viewing websites, playing online games are the streets and the planet where all the houses are build on. But imagine a planet that has an infinite surface, one that expands when a new house is built.</p>
