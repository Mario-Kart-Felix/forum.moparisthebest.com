    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;At the dawn of rsps, we were actually illeagal (hint the shutting down of frugooscape). But as timed passed, and the original rsps became what label as a 194 server became history. we developed another source, the 317. These numbers label the client cache that you download from the original RuneScape website. This source has been manipulated into our OWN version of &quot;RuneScape&quot;. This version is completely made by us, and ever since we have OWNED rsps.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A quote from a server&#39;s site I decided to lol at today.
Are you all this misinformed?</description>
