I think there’s alot of people who would be good mods. Yet I don’t believe we really need one.<br>
Yes I’m new, well sort of. I’ve been using TuT’s, and looking at sigs for <span class="bbcode-i">months</span>, but I’ve only just started to contribute <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
I remember the good old days when I was 12, and I used these forums under a different name, and Mr.Chris was a mod. I sucked at graphics big timee, but I used alot of advice from several ex-members, and several members who’re still active here :D, and I hope to keep learning alot from you guyss.</p>

<p>I do remember your name, actually. Not you personally though.

<p>Ahh, Thanks man. I’m glad we don’t have a mod at this moment in timee, because this little conversation Ive just started is more commonly known as spam. ^_~<br>
And I remember FastBawlz from the old days, he was a proper noob haha, It’s nice to see how much he’s improved. I wish I’d put more of my time into graphics, rather than learning java and html and the likes, I hope I become more active in this section.<br>
I’ll probably be posting some of my gcse graphics coursework up here pretty soon, it’s <span class="bbcode-b">sweet</span>.</p>
