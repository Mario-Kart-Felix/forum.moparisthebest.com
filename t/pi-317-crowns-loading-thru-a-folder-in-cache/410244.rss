    <title>PI 317 Crowns loading thru a folder in cache?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-317-crowns-loading-thru-a-folder-in-cache/410244</link>
    <description>can somebody explain how to change where crowns load from? instead of loading from packed inside the cache, is there a way to change them to loading from a folder withing the cache folder itself? ie: cache\modicons. also could somebody explain how to make a different crown load for all 3 of my player rights instead of playerrights 2 and 3 loading the same crown? also adding a crown for memberstatus? i would very much appreciate this :3 thanks in advance L0lc0pt3r</description>
