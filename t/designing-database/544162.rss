    <title>Designing database</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/designing-database/544162</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I&#39;m currently making a drop log like system on my website. Basically, if you get a rare drop, it saves to a database and then can be viewed online.
I need to design some form of a database to hold this data. That&#39;s my issue.

I believe the data I need to store is:

Player_id = unique player id
npc_name = The name of the npc
item_id = id of item
item_name* = item name
drop_amount = how many items dropped
times_dropped = how many times the player has gotten the drop (updates each time on a duplicate entry)

* I could use the item id&#39;s to show the item images.

The idea is that if you kill a (for example) hill giant and get a dragon scimitar as a rare drop, it would show you got the 1 drop in the database. Then if you got it again, instead of showing 2 different items, it shows you have gotten 2 of the item. If you got a different item, lets say a dragon med helm, it&#39;d show you got that along with the 2 scimitars.</description>

<p>I don’t use MySQL (or any SQL) that often. I mess around with it here and here when I need/want to do something (like this). So if you have an example on a better solution for this, by all means show it.</p>
<p>[quote=“RSCShadow, post:8, topic:544162”]You’d probably want to make a row for each time an item’s dropped, and store something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This schema is pretty versatile in what you can do with it as well. You can get totals of how many items a particular player has gotten drops of, or totals of how many drops the entire player population has gotten, sort it by date dropped etc.</p>
<p>Then you can use npc_id, item_id and player_id to JOIN with other tables. You can also just store the names instead of IDs for any of the above, but in your case, denormalizing the data doesn’t provide any benefits and will most likely just slow down the most common queries you’ll be doing.</p>
<p>If you have any questions on the queries you’d need to write, sort out the table first and ask.[/quote]<br>
Yeah this is similar to what I have. I got a couple extra variables in there because I don’t have a database for npc names or anything. And I need to work out how I’d do that, if any.</p>

I don’t know what information you need…<br>
I’m creating a database to hold all rare drops for the players. Instead of making 1 database for each player, or something like that, I want it all in one database. The data I’ve listed is the data that comes with the drop. Well, basically. Times dropped would be only seen in the database (it’d be updated every time they got the same drop again). The player_id is so I can identify the drops apart, and I use it to grab the player_name from the list I have.</p>

 The Web Guy:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>When a rare drop comes through, just make a simple if statement. Run a query to select all data from the table where item id is the item just dropped and user id is the player. Then the if statement checks to see how many rows have resulted from this query, if it’s 0, insert a new entry. If it’s anything more than zero (which it shouldn’t be, it should be a max of 1.) just run an update query on the item id and set it to itemid+1. If you want I can make a mockup for you and send it through Skype.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You wouldn’t change the item_id… That’d change the image. Hence the “times dropped” variable I have. It ++'s when you get a duplicate drop.</p>
