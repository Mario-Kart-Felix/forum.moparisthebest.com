    <description>No matter what I do do try to fix this error it does not go away. I lower it down and try to fix that 1 error but then come back to this again. I have done this on my client but trying to add it to another client. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing different to get this error...

Edit: I fixed the other two errors but I still remain with this one.

[code]Java\client.java:6437: cannot find symbol
symbol  : method sendPacket(int)
location: class client
                                                sendPacket(103);
                                                ^
