    <title>What programing lang would it be easiest to write in?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-programing-lang-would-it-be-easiest-to-write-in/342317</link>
    <description>ok,

if you were to make a 3d model viewer/interactive thing (ex, rotate,translate,resize), what language would you make it in? (which one would be the easiest to do so in?)

i though C, but people are saying java is much better to do this than C.

your comments (don&#39;t be biased please)</description>

<p>abraham is right however, the language doesn’t make a difference for an application this small.</p>

<p>Back when I started learning C, I wrote an OBJ parser and rendered the model using OpenGL, I then added a semi-functional rotation system. Although it was horribly programmed since I was new at C, it was still pretty easy to develop. Also, it had the plus of using very, very little memory.</p>
