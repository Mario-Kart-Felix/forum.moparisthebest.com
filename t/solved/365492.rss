    <description>Please help! I have a Economy NPC that gives you a archery ticket for 1 Billion and I have a NPC that gives you 1 Billion for a archery ticket. Well let me try explain this, if you have the archery ticket and you talk to the NPC that is suposed to give you 1 Billion for an archery ticket, he gives you 1 Billion and takes away your ticket, that is normal. But I realized that even if you don&#39;t have a archery ticket he still gives you 1 Billion, basically having a archery ticket isn&#39;t required to get the 1 Billion. The same thing is for the guy that gives you the archery ticket for 1 Billion. He will take away your billion if you have it and give you the archery ticket, but still will give you the archery ticket if you don&#39;t have 1 Billion. Please help!  :( Thanks for reading. (By the way if you are wondering I have a 317 Deltascape source)

Code:
&lt;blockquote&gt;if(c.NpcDialogue == 124){
c.playerHasItem(995, 1000000000);
c.addItem(1464, 1);
c.deleteItem(995, 1000000000);
c.closeAll();
c.sM(&quot;Thanks for your exchange.&quot;);
}
if(c.NpcDialogue == 125){
c.playerHasItem(1464, 1);
c.addItem(995, 1000000000);
c.deleteItem(1464, 1);
c.closeAll();
c.sM(&quot;Thanks for your exchange.&quot;);
