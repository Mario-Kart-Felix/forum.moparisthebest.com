    <description>So, somehow I broke my server. I don&#39;t know what I did, but now I can&#39;t log in. I&#39;ve spent days trying to debug this, but to no avail. 

I know I&#39;m getting stopped here, in RS2LoginProtocolDecoder (server.net) in the load method:

[code=java]
Client cl = new Client(session, -1);
[/code]

That obviously leads me here:

[code=java]
public Client(IoSession s, int _playerId) {
	super(_playerId);
	this.session = s;
	synchronized(this) {
		outStream = new Stream(new byte[Config.BUFFER_SIZE]);
		outStream.currentOffset = 0;
	}
	inStream = new Stream(new byte[Config.BUFFER_SIZE]);
	inStream.currentOffset = 0;
	buffer = new byte[Config.BUFFER_SIZE];
}
[/code]

Now, it isn&#39;t getting past the part where it calls [i]super(_playerid)[/i] which is where it sends you to the Player constructor:

[code=java]
public Player(int _playerId) {
		
		playerId = _playerId;
		playerRights = 0;

		for (int i=0; i&lt;playerItems.length; i++) {
			playerItems[i] = 0;
		}
		for (int i=0; i&lt;playerItemsN.length; i++) {
			playerItemsN[i] = 0;
		}

		for (int i=0; i&lt;playerLevel.length; i++) {
			if (i == 3) {
				playerLevel[i] = 10;
			} else {
				playerLevel[i] = 1;
			}
		}

		for (int i=0; i&lt;playerXP.length; i++) {
			if (i == 3) {
				playerXP[i] = 1300;
			} else {
				playerXP[i] = 0;
			}
		}
		for (int i=0; i &lt; Config.BANK_SIZE; i++) {
			bankItems[i] = 0;
		}

		for (int i=0; i &lt; Config.BANK_SIZE; i++) {
			bankItemsN[i] = 0;
		}
		
		playerAppearance[0] = 0; // gender
		playerAppearance[1] = 7; // head
		playerAppearance[2] = 25;// Torso
		playerAppearance[3] = 29; // arms
		playerAppearance[4] = 35; // hands
		playerAppearance[5] = 39; // legs
		playerAppearance[6] = 44; // feet
		playerAppearance[7] = 14; // beard
		playerAppearance[8] = 7; // hair colour
		playerAppearance[9] = 8; // torso colour
		playerAppearance[10] = 9; // legs colour
		playerAppearance[11] = 5; // feet colour
		playerAppearance[12] = 0; // skin colour	
		
		apset = 0;
		actionID = 0;

		playerEquipment[playerHat]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerCape]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerAmulet]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerChest]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerShield]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerLegs]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerHands]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerFeet]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerRing]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerArrows]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerWeapon]=-1;
		
		heightLevel = 0;

		
		teleportToX = Config.START_LOCATION_X;
		teleportToY = Config.START_LOCATION_Y;

		
		absX = absY = -1;
		mapRegionX = mapRegionY = -1;
		currentX = currentY = 0;
		resetWalkingQueue();
		
	}
[/code]

The weird thing is, it gets through this whole method just fine, and I can&#39;t figure out where it&#39;s getting stuck after that. Any ideas you could have would be greatly appreciated!

UPDATE: Some sort of exception is being thrown, as proved by this method in ConnectionHandler (server.net):

[code=java]
public void exceptionCaught(IoSession arg0, Throwable arg1) throws Exception {
	System.out.println(&quot;connectionhandler exception caught&quot;);
}
[/code]

However, I can&#39;t find where this method is ever called, or what exception it&#39;s talking about. I really have minimal knowledge of the actual networking used here, and any pointers would also be nice.

UPDATE 2: I&#39;m dumb, etc, I figured it out.</description>

              <p>It’s actually always like that when the session is created, and then the ID is assigned later (I learned a lot about this by looking way too deeply into the problem)</p>
<p>Basically what I had tried to do before it stopped working was to try to use the Player to emulate another Object, which you can’t do.</p>
