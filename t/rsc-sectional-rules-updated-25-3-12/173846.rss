    <description>[center][b][u]Sectional rules - UPDATED(25/3/12)[/center]

These rules are in place to make this section a friendly enviroment in which people may learn, discuss and thrive. If the rules are broken, the member shall be punished accordingly. You should not be trying to find loop-holes in the rules, but be trying to obey them. The [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354311.0.html]Global forum rules[/url] still apply in this section.

[b]1)[/b] &#39;Trolling&#39;, &#39;flaming&#39;, and &#39;spamming&#39; are looked down upon in this forum. Any member caught doing any of these things shall be punished according to the seriousness of their post. Multiple offences will be liable for a mute. Trolling to get a laugh out of something is acceptable, however trolling to put somebody down and frustrate them shall not be condoned.

[b]2)[/b] We are all equal on this community, which means that nobody is inferior or superior to anybody else. (to clarify, I&#39;m talking about &#39;My server is better than yours&#39;, &#39;You can&#39;t code&#39;, etc). This is an informative community, so posts should be helpful. Criticism is fine, just keep it constructive.

[b]3)[/b] Requests are not allowed in this section, nor is talking about specific problems with servers. If you have a problem, post on the servers official thread.

[b]4)[/b] We don&#39;t discuss compiler errors, basic java programming and compiling tools. The first two can be fixed by visiting the Sun website and checking out the java tutorials, and the second can be fixed with apache ant (http://ant.apache.org/)

[b]5)[/b] Informative and well organised tutorials are allowed and encouraged in this section, however it is forbidden to create a C&amp;P tutorial. This board is for development, not a few bare lines of code.

[b]6)[/b] Keep advertisements to the advertising section. This section is for flaunting your server only.

[b]7)[/b] Bots have little, if anything, to do with the progression of RSC server development. Topics that are bot-related are no longer welcome in this section. All bot-related topics will be removed

[b]8)[/b] Development teams shall be acceptable from now forth on the condition that the development is open-sourced. Any closed source development teams are unacceptable and the topic shall be locked. If you wish to talk about botting, then visit [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,22.0.html]this[/url] section.


Make sure you familiarize yourself with the above rules. Also be aware that a moderator may decide to update these at any time and it is your job to keep yourself informed of the rules. Also, a moderator can and will moderate at his/her own discretion. A moderators decision is final. If you have a problem with a decision that was made, then take it up through PM , don&#39;t make a topic about it.</description>
