    <title>RS2D Packet Bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs2d-packet-bug/280676</link>
    <description>Hi! I have a question. I think everyone who used RS2D asked this at one point.

Okay well I&#39;m using an RS2D source, the one released by Jim. The problem that I have is, sometimes, TOTALLY RANDOM, the server would just spam a client with packets.

Like one time I was talking to a person and then I disconnect. I see a bunch of

&quot;Unhandled packet [ID = ....]&quot;

In my server log.

This is a MAJOR, MAJOR roadblock in my RS2D source.

ANY help is appreciated.

I will give credits to everyone who helped me if I ever finish my server.</description>
