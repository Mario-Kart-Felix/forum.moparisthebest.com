    <description>[b]This is common sense! And it [i]will[/i] hurt! But the pain isn&#39;t much and it&#39;s worth it![/b]

Alright. I used to have acne, and I found this out myself, and it works (Ask Zammyking111)! However, you have to be able to tolerate a stinging pain for a while... And I recommend only doing a small portion of your acne a time, so that way, a huge part of you won&#39;t burn.

[b]You Need: [/b]Soap, a rag/cloth (Better if it&#39;s rough), and water.

[b]Step One: [/b]Wash your face with soap.

[b]Step Two: [/b]Take a cloth/rag and flood it with soap and rub it together until it doesn&#39;t unfold when you let go of it.

[b]Step Three: [/b]Rub the cloth/rag thoroughly where your acne is, and after a few minutes, move it. Keep doing this until you have gotten every spot of your acne for atleast two minutes.

[b]Why It Works: [/b]The rug/cloth should tear the top layer of your skin, and wash out all the bacteria in your acne and clean you up!

Like I said, only do a small part because you don&#39;t want a huge part of you hurting at once!

Times..

[b]An hour after this treatment: [/b]Your skin will be a red color and will sting if you touch it.

[b]The next day, or many hours later: [/b]There will be dry skin where you rubbed

[b]Day three: [/b]It will become unnoticeable, but you will still feel the dry skin.

[b]Day four: [/b]Most likely your skin will be fine and you&#39;re acne free!

[b]Does this make you an emo for causing pain to yourself purposely?[/b] IMO, no :P


Hope I helped you!

<p>Although most of my acne has gone now that i dont eat so much greasy food.</p>
<p>You gotta remember if you eat greasy food and do this, after you’ve done it the acne will just come back after a few days. Just stick to eating non greasy food after you’ve done this.</p>
<p>Also this can scar your face slightly if done to rough. (Not badly scar but just leave small crators of skin).</p>
