    <title>So.. At my school</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-at-my-school/456505</link>
    <description>Well today I went to school late because the highway had gotten backed up from a wreck; so I went to school 10 minutes late. When I arrived to the parking lot, the gates were locked, meaning I couldn&#39;t park my car, and besides that all the spots were full. So, I went to the other parking lot and the gates were also locked with full parking.

Now my question is, I paid $60.00 to be able to park AT the school. There are other places to park (not at the school) but I could get towed. Is this fair I paid, but can&#39;t park?</description>

<p>A movie is 2 hours long, so missing 10 minutes is missing 1/12 of what you paid for. He missed one day out of however long he paid for, which if it was the whole school year is around 1/180 (or like 1/45 if it was for a quarter, etc)</p>

              <p>Similar to paying to visit movie online, if you arrive late you are going to miss part of the movie and no matter how much you beg they aren’t going to start over for you (no matter if it was your fault or not). You aren’t being repeatedly denied access, are you? If it was just this time and you were late, I don’t think it’s their fault at all. So you’re missing PART of what you paid for.
