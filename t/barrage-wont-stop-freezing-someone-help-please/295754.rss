    <description>Okay when u attack someone with ice barrage they wont un freeze after a set amount of time. if you keep freezing them they have almost no hope of winning a fight if they are meleeing. and when after they die. they are still frozen for about 20 minutes.

Someone please help me fix this.</description>
