    <description>an instant mute and depending what mood i am in or how many times you have done it, ill ban you.

Rules are there for a reason. If i see one time posters posting some server thats not theres or that is RS2, you will be banned.

Also your topic will be locked, and the first post will be cleared.</description>

You joined in LATE 2008, I joined in EARLY 2006. I didn’t do anything for “the status” (whatever the fuck that is). You have no right to judge me, you’ve only been here for like 3 months, I’ve been here for 3 years, you don’t know fuck all so go away. I’m back on my 10th account, it got unbanned recently, eventually I’ll move onto my 12th account, but rog3r is still beating me with 14 accs.</p>
