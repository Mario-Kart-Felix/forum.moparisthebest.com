    <title>Basic 508-614 editing!? Please help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/basic-508-614-editing-please-help/385459</link>
    <description>Okay.

I recently decided to make the switch from 317 to 614. I have coded inside and out with 317 for about 1 and a half years. However, I have very little experience with 614. I currently have Deception source, which is the same as most 508 or 614 sources, and they are broken down into the following folders-

Bin
Com
Data
Deps

etc....


And, I just need to know how to get to the client.java so I can edit the owner, and the login messages.


If you could help me by replying, it would be very appreciated. All I need to know is to find-

Shop Handlers
Client.java to edit login messages etc..



Thanks guys!
