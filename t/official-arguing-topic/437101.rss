    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/official-arguing-topic/437101</link>
    <description>This community is one of the most annoying ones, ever.
Even when theres under 50 active users on RSC-section, only a tenth of the posts are actually regarding RSC or it&#39;s deveploment.
I&#39;m fed up with reading all of your nonsense flamewars in every topic.

Please, unleash your obsessional need of arguing over something in this topic so other users who don&#39;t give a flying fuck doesn&#39;t have to read it.


Something to light this thread up:

- Luke&#39;s server will be superior compared to any other private rsc server.
- It&#39;s not our business if Luke makes some money out of his server (rscemulation as we speak).
- High exp and drop rates have ruined every fucking server there has been, including rscangel and rscemulation.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:27, topic:437101”]The only comments I take on board are those from known community members that I know aren’t just trolling for a reaction. Those such as MITB, xEnt, Zilent, Peeter (for example) and the people that <span class="bbcode-b">actually play RSC</span> private servers. Most of the people (I’d go as far as saying 90%) that flame me contribute absolutely nothing themselves and show <span class="bbcode-b">no interest in helping RSC progress</span>/survive. I’d also say most of them have <span class="bbcode-b">no interest in RSC what-so-ever</span>, they merely like the drama behind the private server/cheating scene.</p>
<p>If you look at the previous posts of the main people that flame me (such as <span class="bbcode-b">DealingRocks</span> above) you will see that <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=560640" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">every single post he’s made</a> is attempting to criticise me in anyway he can.

<p>[ul][li]Actually plays RSC[/li]<br>
[li]Has interest in RSC[/li]<br>
[li]Isn’t hiding behind an “anonymous identity” (nice oxymoron)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>hurr durr</p>
<p>then again, according to your definition anyone who doesn’t play RSCE isn’t an RSC player and hates the game. And anyone who hasn’t had an active account on mopar for years doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Most of the people you claim are hiding behind identities to flame you are actually people who lurk in IRC and noticed that you have an oversized ego.</p>

<p>Unless you have tried running something like this for the length of time I have you have no idea of the challenges you face. It’s either tell the community about the situation or simply not make the payment. I decided to go with the first option.</p>

It’s interesting because you have said time and time again you made BeyondRSC for a quick earn and quit RSCA because you wasn’t paid enough, yet you then claim I’m money hungry? For doing what exactly?<span class="bbcode-b"> Why am I any more ‘money hungry’ than KO9 or Reines (or anyone else that had the standard subscription system in place)?</span> I’m not sure how you can accuse me of being money hungry when you admit to selling items during your spell at RSCA and as soon as you had admin writes on RSCE you were spawning shit for your friends (which I assume was for payment as well).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>I’m competitive yeah. I like competition though, I get bored unless I’m competing against something. It’s the reason why I haven’t touched RSCE in about 5 months now (there’s nothing to compete with).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertising? I haven’t personally advertised hard anywhere except the usual forums and top lists (and SEO). Just because the URL is spammed doesn’t mean the owner of the server is behind it. In fact I remember back in the day Peeter asking me to post an announcement asking the players not to advertise on other servers for this very reason.</p>

They didn’t claim they couldn’t afford the server payments basically <span class="bbcode-i">every month</span> to get extra money in their back pockets?</p>

<p>I find it very ironic that you are accusing people of not contributing to RSC…</p>
<p>You suck, RSCE sucks (I can’t bring myself to call it “your server”), RSCDaemon sucks (can’t bring myself to call it a server at all, it’d have to exist first).</p>

<p>What gives you the idea Reines was money hungry? He paid for the server reinet/syi were on out of his own pocket. He implemented subscriptions because the DDoS attacks were affecting things unrelated to RSCDaemon (different forums, IRC server). He didn’t implement it because he felt he deserved something for the work he put in. If he was money hungry, then he would have made people pay for STS and he wouldn’t have made RSCD invite only at first.</p>
<p>What have you done that makes you seem money hungry? How about scamming a few dozen people for pixels? I remember once someone posted a MySpace email:pass dump that I had on my server onto SYI. Some people thought it would be cool to try the combo’s on PayPal and then steal money from people they knew nothing about. They ended up sending ~$600 to Reines through different accounts. Instead of keeping the money, he bans the people who stole it from his community and refunds it all back to whoever had money stolen from them.</p>
<p>Is that enough reason to suspect your motives over someone whose motives have been proven to be well intended?</p>

<p>The only comments I take on board are those from known community members that I know aren’t just trolling for a reaction. Those such as MITB, xEnt, Zilent, Peeter (for example) and the people that actually play RSC private servers. Most of the people (I’d go as far as saying 90%) that flame me contribute absolutely nothing themselves and show no interest in helping RSC progress/survive. I’d also say most of them have no interest in RSC what-so-ever, they merely like the drama behind the private server/cheating scene.</p>
<p>If you look at the previous posts of the main people that flame me (such as DealingRocks above) you will see that <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=560640" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">every single post he’s made</a> is attempting to criticise me in anyway he can. It’s a bit obsessive and obvious to anyone that isn’t trolling themselves that it’s someone hiding behind an anonymous identity clearly only here attempting to troll.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Mopar’s moderators just let it happen which is why this place is such a flamefest. Anyone actually interested in doing stuff is driven away by these idiots and you’ve instantly got a shit community.</p>

They do not DDOS other servers just because your own server is worth less than a localhost easyrsc.<br>
Its because noone respects you, even the people that play your server and like it, they don’t respect you.<br>
As long as people know what you are like, NOONE is going to respect you, without respect, you have no rights.<br>
