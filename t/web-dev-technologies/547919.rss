    <title>Web dev technologies?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/web-dev-technologies/547919</link>
    <description>I&#39;m about to start a web development project with some fellow students of mine. We haven&#39;t really seen much about technologies besides html, css and javascript yet. This project will include interaction with a database.

I&#39;m fairly new to web development so need some info on what technologies to learn / use.
I know there probably isn&#39;t a [i]better[/i] programming language, but which one do you prefer and why? PHP, RoR, Django, .. ?

Thanks in advance!</description>

“Have heard good things about Python, haven’t used it myself.” - It’s great! But don’t take my word for it (which you probably won’t anyways), try it yourself! Coming from other OOP languages, it’s extremely easy to learn, and it’s functionality is quite good.</p>
<p>“Ruby is for hipters. Steer clear.” - Hipsters* first of all. And 2nd! He’s lying. Ruby is quite good if you research on it and use it a bit. I’m not extremely knowledgeable when it comes to Ruby - but the few times I’ve used it, I’ve enjoyed it quite a bit.</p>

<p>That’s like saying why use Java, it comes with a ton of API and libs that you don’t even use. That doesn’t affect overall performance though does it.</p>
<p>So you get extra stuff with Rails, so what? It’s easy to customize that anyway.[/quote]It’s not about performance; it’s about maintainability, code cleanliness, good abstractions and separation of concerns. It’s easier for somebody to maintain a few simple packages that have a small scope than it is to maintain wheel reinventions. If every framework has to implement more features then that means that there are more potential bugs and that they are more likely to ‘half ass’ an implementation of something. It’s not about performance or convenience, it’s a matter of principle.</p>

That’s like saying why use Java, it comes with a ton of API and libs that you don’t even use. That doesn’t affect overall performance though does it.</p>
<p>So you get extra stuff with Rails, so what? It’s easy to customize that anyway.</p>

              <p>I’ve been writing a web application using Django for the last few months for a software engineering class. I feel that I’ve been confined to restrictions based on the flexibility of Django itself, so unless you know how to rethink your ideas to fit Django’s framework, you might find difficulty with that. Also, in order to fully leverage Django’s power, you have to have a strong knowledge of web development (i.e. MVC, templates, database models, …) itself because of the power it contains. Though, there is a lot of ‘hand waving’ involved with some parts, so you don’t get as much control. Oh, and it also comes bundled with its own web server, so you don’t have to worry about that.</p>
<p>The last time I used Flask, I found it delightful and easy to follow, but I didn’t extensively look into its usage enough to grasp its full potential. There’s some fascinating things I’ve read about it though, so that’s a route to take.</p>
<p>Doing any sort of LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) work will give you full control of your web application. You’ll have to configure things from the ground up though. While it might be easy to get those four components running, the web application will need to be built yourself, unless you decide to use a framework (I have no experience using PHP frameworks).</p>
<p>I haven’t looked into RoR at all though, but the last time I tried it (a few years ago), it was a massive elephant of files to associate with a simple Hello World script, which turned me off.</p>
<p>So, to summarize, <span class="bbcode-b">Django</span> gives you a lot of power and less flexibility, <span class="bbcode-b">LAMP</span> gives you a lot of control and flexibility with deficiency in scaling, and Flask/RoR are uncertain to me. Seems like RoR is good though, from other replies I’ve read here.</p>

<p>Web frameworks are there, to some degree, to abstract the HTTP protocol away from the user and to provide tools that help manage some of the bulkwork you’d otherwise have to do when writing a web app. You still need to know a bit of stuff though.</p>
<p>If you don’t know Ruby, you can also just try another micro-framework similar to Sinatra but written in another language.</p>

<p>Sorry if the following question seems retarded but keep in mind I have never done any web development yet!</p>
<p>Is it correct to say that everything discussed above is a backbone technology while HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for the actual designing and making the site interactive?[/quote]<br>
Yes. What we have been discussing is back end development, it all goes on behind the scenes for database manipulation etc whereas the HTML &amp; CSS are the bare elements for the sites design. I didn’t mention JS because we did discuss Express/Node which are JavaScript backend frameworks, it can get a bit confusing for a beginner going into that.</p>
<p>Also bare in mind CSS3 is a great tool to bypass using something like jQuery when designing. CSS Animations &amp; Transitions will be your best friend.</p>
