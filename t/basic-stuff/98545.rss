    <description>hey i have a couple things to ask. one is if i should learn any type of computer programing language to mess with moparscape what should it be. and two is when i got the server base it had no errors then when i changed the name of the person the npc says if they are online or not to my name why it said 100 errors? question 3 is why if i change something in the code like the current owner of the server why it wont change in the game. and last when i follow tuts perfectly like the clan one were you can make your own clans it wont work even when i followed it exaxtly.

i would like your help asap because i need to ge the servers fixed.   thx</description>
