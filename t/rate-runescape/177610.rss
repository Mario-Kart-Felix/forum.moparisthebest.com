Runescape is fun but not that fun to play until your 22... O and he admits it on his youtube video... His youtube username is like Zezima0264 or something.</description>

I still can’t figure out why there’s so many people bitching about pking. Look at all the ways you can pk in this game, choose one of them and stfu.<br>
[/quote]PKing used to be free and the players were in control. Nowadays Jagex has total control over it. That’s the difference and by bitching about PKing people are really talking about how the overall scenario has changed and how they dislike it.

<p>But why bitch about it then quit when there are so many other ways to pk?</p>

I accedently voted 1/10 instead of 0/10. I think that Runescape Started to become dead when they introduced that wildly ditch. Then they moved on to that stupid duel area limit, then pest control got fucked up. Then they even did that stupid trade thing.

<p>Gah, people are VERY thick. Pking is still here. Pking stands for player killing and you can still do that in castlewars, duel arena, duel tournaments, clan wars, bounty hunter, and poh’s. So, really, go kill players in those different games if you want to kill players.</p>

<p>I think people think pking is dead is because you can’t go anywhere in the wilderness and kill some random person take stuff and run.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Obviously. I’m sure if you still want the thrill of the wilderness you can very much do so by battling any of the dragons without an anti d shield or by fighting them revalance crappers out there. (can’t find a database with records on the warrior yet; must be powerful!)[/quote]And ur obviously a retard, if you can’t get people’s loot there is no real pvp. I loved back in the days how you could lose anything at any time.</p>
<p>To PaulT: You pretty much summed it up. A perfect example is how runescape now has emo-haircuts and hitler-moustasches. What happened to the middle-aged theme?</p>

              <p>0/10</p>
<p>The difficulty of building up your skills is nonexistent because of extensive guides available on every game mechanic. The only challenge in Runescape is making yourself actually do the clicking. Since <span class="bbcode-b">Independent Thinking</span> really only takes place when determining the most efficient methods of gaining experience or money, it would seem a waste to actually do any repetitive clicking yourself. If you just want to have “Fun” playing Runescape, consider what the minigames offer and realize what shitty game experiences they are on their own. It is only their connection to the larger persistent world which would make them ‘fun’. I mean, I’m not saying Castle Wars isn’t wicked awesome and shit, but it really isn’t even as fun as a multiplayer round of Hexen.</p>
<p>The only way you could possibly confuse Runescape with something <span class="bbcode-b">fun</span> is if you cheat. Even the NPCs in Runescape know that it’s a video game! It has no plot, only random half-baked ideas shoved together! Clearly, it is a game within a game. By playing it, you are losing. By not playing, you are winning.</p>
<p>Why do I say that you are losing Runescape by playing it? It is a game which has no internal life. The game actively stifles the imagination, for there is no true gameworld; there is a fantasy world, inside of a video game world, which is all inside of the real world. The fantasy world is the world of Runescape brought to life by our imagination. The middle ages, with magic and lots of seafood. The video game world is the reality of how the game actually works. You can drink an infinite amount of beer without getting alcohol poisoning and dying, the NPCs know it’s a game, you can mine the same rock an infinite number of times, etc… The real world is the numbers on a Jagex server, which you can manipulate in a in better fashion through <span class="bbcode-b">your own client</span> rather than the one <span class="bbcode-b">Jagex provides</span>. And this is the real game; cheating.</p>
<p>Since Jagex actively encourages all three ways of playing the game (they encourage the immersive fantasy aspect of the game as much as possible in every update, they encourage the meta-game-aspect by having holiday events and adding pop-culture references as much as possible, and they encourage cheating by adding easter eggs for cheaters and making cheating harder) we can see that it must be a truly shitty game, for them to try so hard to encourage people to spend time with it. I guess the moral is that anybody can make an incredibly bad game attractive simply by appealing to peoples sense of wonder.</p>
