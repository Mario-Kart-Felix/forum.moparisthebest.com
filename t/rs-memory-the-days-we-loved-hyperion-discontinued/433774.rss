<p>I’ve held over 100 real players back in November. I wasn’t actually there when it happened, but if I remember correctly, according to everyone, there was no difference in speed and lag. And some of our ways of programming are awful and terrifying.</p>
<p>And our huge, huge, huge killer process() method which has never been updated.</p>

<p>One thing I don’t like is that every development is remakes. Why can’t we make a unique different server than remakes all the time. 80 percent of these topics are, “The days we loved.” I can understand you guys miss old Runescape (as so do I) but if everyone will do it than there will be no unique server in the future. 99.9 percent will be Runescape Remakes. At least 40 or possibly 50 percent is enough, but really, people need to move on and find a unique way to code different things of different levels, not be grasping for old things. I bet you, in 2050, if this keeps up, the titles will still be, “The days we loved.” However, what days? At that time, people will remember new things and move on with it, not stick to one thing. I follow the saying, “Grasping for new code will benefit you and the future, bringing new things to life will be the “old” new.” Now old new is perfect for the community. Old new means as in, since people love old things so much (such as I love old Runescape and old Bakugan), that popularity is compared to new, as new is a new things. Old new means amazing thing, not the other way around (which means to remake old things all the time, and that is exactly what this community does).

              <p>[quote=“arham 4, post:14, topic:433774”]One thing I don’t like is that every development is remakes. Why can’t we make a unique different server than remakes all the time. 80 percent of these topics are, “The days we loved.” I can understand you guys miss old Runescape (as so do I) but if everyone will do it than there will be no unique server in the future. 99.9 percent will be Runescape Remakes. At least 40 or possibly 50 percent is enough, but really, people need to move on and find a unique way to code different things of different levels, not be grasping for old things. I bet you, in 2050, if this keeps up, the titles will still be, “The days we loved.” However, what days? At that time, people will remember new things and move on with it, not stick to one thing. I follow the saying, “Grasping for new code will benefit you and the future, bringing new things to life will be the “old” new.” Now old new is perfect for the community. Old new means as in, since people love old things so much (such as I love old Runescape and old Bakugan), that popularity is compared to new, as new is a new things. Old new means amazing thing, not the other way around (which means to remake old things all the time, and that is exactly what this community does). We should stop <span class="bbcode-b">grasping</span> for <span class="bbcode-b">old code</span> and move on to make <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">new code</span></span>. That just meses up the saying. Modifying the saying to this community would be, “Grasping for <span class="bbcode-b">old code</span> will benefit <span class="bbcode-b">me and others who love old Runescape</span>, <span class="bbcode-b">not making new things, but creating old things are very unique and are the most best thing ever</span>.” What I have <span class="bbcode-b">bolded</span> is what is changed by this communities perspective.</p>

I Agree, but Certain Amount of People Makes Remake Since they are Tired of Using PI all the time, Yes they can Go to a Different Revision like 562+.</p>

EDIT: I just read your first line and I think your thinking I thought this is a Runescape remake. When I made this message, I was going to other remakes, not this non remake. I posted it on this topic as both this topic was the right topic to post it and also that I am I happy that this isn’t like the others.</p>

<p>It has a changeable game frame, you can choose between 459 - 474. I’ll post a picture. And no, I said the revision is 459 with a 474 gameframe.</p>
