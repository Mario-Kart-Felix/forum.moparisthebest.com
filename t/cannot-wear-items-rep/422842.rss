    <title>Cannot Wear Items (rep++)</title>

    <description>Really weird error, not sure if it&#39;s due to how the packets are configured though.

I can&#39;t wear any non custom. I have no idea what the hell I did, but I do not believe I modified anything.

My server is hugely based off customs (ID&#39;s more than 8000), they&#39;re all able to be worn, but not the regular items that are below 8000.

The problem is not server sided. It&#39;s definately something I did wrong in &#39;client&#39; or &#39;class8&#39;.

Any help?</description>
