    <description>OK so so you can kind of classify me as new to servers i ran one a year ago did a little coding and stopped. It&#39;s been a whole year without them so i literally for got like 75% of the stuff. I&#39;m creating a new one and the only problem i have so far is i cant go on to www.client.silabsoft.org I need to get on that to test things on server and to play on it. I go to the website click yes i agree to crap and yada yada it starts to load go to requestion title screen i think then it tries to connect to something fails and starts again.

 If you can make any suggestion, have an alternative want to help, or think you know the problem reply and or send me a message prefferably tonight.

PS BIG THING HERE I JUST RECENTLY WIPED MY COMPUTER AND PUT VISTA ON IT SO IT COULD BE LACKING ANYTHING OR FIREWALLED IN OR NEW SETTINGS THANK YOU</description>

galkons client…Galkons client can be typed in google and downloaded<br>
no offense to anybody who likes <a href="http://silabsoft.org" rel="nofollow noopener">silabsoft.org</a> but the graphics are kind of<br>
i would say fucked up.No offense.But yeah galkons client will work with your server.<br>
all you do is download it extract it to desktop then run it watch it load then click on change ip<br>
change 127.0.0.1 to your ip of your server and your good to go my friend.</p>
