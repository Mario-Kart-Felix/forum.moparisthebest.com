    <description>Im leeching here because my friend said it was ok to leech his server.

Ok I downloaded Java Develemont Kit(JDK)6 update 14.  And Java 6 update 14.  Then I to the files double clicked compiler.  It said

Note: Frame_Dub1.java uses or overrides a deprecated API
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for deatils
Finished!
Press Any key to continue.


Then I pressed any key.

Then after that I hit ctrl F then typed client then hit search.  Went to client.java and hit ctrl f again then Searched for all the server names and changed them into the server name i wanted.  Then clicked save as.  Then I dragged the client.java into the run, didnt do anything, then i dragged compiler into run still nothing.

I am just stuck here please help.

And explain step by step not 1 thing then a thing thats like 10 steps away.</description>
