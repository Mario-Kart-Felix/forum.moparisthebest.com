    <title>PC Under Attack?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pc-under-attack/456060</link>
    <description>Okay, so I was playing runescape when my client randomly crashed, just out of nowhere closed. I instantly reloaded a client and tried to login and couldn&#39;t for 15 minutes. I finally logged in noticed that the last connection wasn&#39;t my IP and all of my possessions were gone, but not long after I logged in my client crashed again. 

By this time, I knew something pretty bad was going on. But wait, it gets better..

I opened my Task Manager to see if there were any suspicious processes and I couldn&#39;t find a thing, while looking at my processes, they just all started to end. If I opened a program it would close. It was like someone had total control of my PC and I had hardly any other than opening programs that would be instantly closed until my PC turned off. 

So, I hopped straight onto another PC to see if I could figure anything out about what may have happened and I&#39;m clueless. So, could anyone please tell me what has happened and how I can prevent this in the future.

Also, should I change all of my passwords(PayPal, Facebook, etc..) from a different PC asap?</description>

<p>I remove it and scan again and it is still there. Any idea of why that would happen?</p>

You would imagine you would change passwords to stuff like PayPal as they could try and steal your cash.</p>
