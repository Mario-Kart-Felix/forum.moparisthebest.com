              <p>In the client.java there will be another place to input your ip make sure the one that’s not connecting to your server is at local host or your friend can’t connect, the other reason is because there will be an error in the cache somewhere like it might be missing a file or it might have being unzipped wrong ect.</p>

              <p>each computer on your router (including devices like phones) have a gateway IP if yours is not static your ip will change when your router restarts</p>
<p>you can find your gateway ip at CMD &gt; IPconfig<br>
then it will say your router gateway e.g 192.168.?.?</p>
<p>then it will say your gateway ip e.g 192.168.?.? ^not same</p>
<p>when portforwarding it asks for an ip for the rule to be applyed on, so if your ip changes the rule ip will be on another IP / computer.</p>
<p>to make sure this does not happen google “How to make a LAN static IP” that should give a simple tutorial, if you have anymore questions feel free to ask</p>
