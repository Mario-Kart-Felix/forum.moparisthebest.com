    <title>Cans omeone give me an unmute command?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cans-omeone-give-me-an-unmute-command/382209</link>
    <description>I muted my friend and now i can&#39;t unmute him.
I don&#39;t see any logs showing his mute.
I can&#39;t do ::unmute since i dont have the command.
I tried to delete his account and have him make it but it was still muted.
Can I have a :unmute command?
Thanks

I&#39;m on a 317 czar/delta based server.
