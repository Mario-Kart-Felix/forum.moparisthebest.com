    <title>Good Clean Base For Starting A Project?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-clean-base-for-starting-a-project/515144</link>
    <description>Hello community of Moparscape! I&#39;m am sort of new to coding, and I thought that starting on a blank source and client would help me to learn java better. Can anybody recommend me a good clean base please? It would help if it had basic dupes fixed. Thank you so much!

P.S. I looked into a blank Project Insanity source and client, but people said Project Insanity sucked... If PI sucks, then what should I use?</description>
