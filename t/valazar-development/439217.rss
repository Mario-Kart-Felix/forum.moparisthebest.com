    <description>[b]Introduction:[/b] The server has been online for almost two weeks, we&#39;ve started to work more on the server as we&#39;ve came down to stop working on the forums as we feel as there almost finished with the help of our second &quot;hired&quot; forum developer. Now that I have someone in my place to work on the forums, I&#39;ve been doing much community related work, could be various things. Other than that, Jordon and I have been doing our best to make sure the member-base of our community enjoy themselves.

              <p>Forum Updates:</p>
<p>4-26</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">*Donation has been changed to 'Shopping'
*Revised the main shopping page, made the text easier to understand, fixed links, basic tweaks throughout it etc.
*All navigation bars now say "Shop" instead of "Purchase"</code></pre>
<p>4-28</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">*Added a new download page, http://valazar.com/download/. You are now taken to that page when you click a link that says "Download", and you can download the client from there.
*Added a quick navigation bar to the bottom of website pages (not the forum), just a somewhat useful thing to have for if someone is at the bottom of a page and wants to navigate - *Note: due to speed issues, this feature is only on the homepage and webclient pages.
*Tweaks made to the Hiscores page.
*The Webclient page can now be found at http://valazar.com/webclient/, instead of http://valazar.com/webclient.php. The Java 6 webclient can now be found at http://valazar.com/webclient/j6.php, and the Java 7 webclient can now be found at http://valazar.com/webclient/j7.php.
*Forum and website navbars are now up-to-date.
*You can now sign up for an account on the actual Valazar website! To do this, you can go to http://valazar.com/user/ and click "Register". Once you register and log in, you will be able to access the Member Zone, which is only accessible to people who have an account. As of now there is nothing on it, but there will soon be exlusive content.</code></pre>

<p>Nice to know you aren’t abusive 0.o Been on too many servers/forums where there are abusive staff</p>

<p>-We are talking  about  how a person gives  good CC about the current website state.<br>
-Developer states that  he isn’t going to  pretend that  he likes something when he doesn’t<br>
-OP points out what you just implied<br>
-Developer says I am twisting words? ~^ Posted that on Mopar for James to view… 0.o I didn’t twist anything your the one who said it.</p>
<p>Edit <span class="hashtag">#2</span> he just deleted the last part  from my post :fp:</p>
<p>Edit <span class="hashtag">#3</span> Now I am REALLY laughing. There was an “update” about ::players   being  shown on an interface? really? …</p>
<p>James I am sorry  but I have to question now who you are working with.</p>
<p>Edit <span class="hashtag">#4</span> Please read the pm I sent you on forums. Make sure to delete my character account as well so it isn’t on the server.</p>

<p>Like I said to Jordon, have the client create a text file and have the exceptions throw in it… Or he can get creative and have a pop up window that says the client crashed and has the error on that. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
