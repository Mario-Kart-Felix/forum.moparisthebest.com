Sorry, but no, while it may seem that it should be that way it is not. In the USA you are innocent unless proven guilty meaning that whether or not you did the crime you are not a criminal but rather a suspect unless proven to be guilty of a crime in a court of law.</p>

<p>[quote]There are laws in this country that are incorrect and wrong. For example the rich are protected against the law while the poor are subject to the whim of the rich, drug addicts are treated as criminals instead of people who are sick, and groups such as blacks, gays, hispanics, and other minorities have been systematically discriminated against, and still are, under law. These are but a few small examples, there are countless others of the law protecting large corporations before the individual person, of the law bending to the will of those who can afford a certain lawyer, of politicians citing “Executive privelage” and etc…</p>

<p>I agree with you on the first part, but on the case of drugs, if it has been made a law not to do it, and you are caught doing it, you are breaking the law and will be dealt with accordingly.[/quote]<br>
Whether or not the men behind the curtains say something is wrong is not the problem it is that when someone is truly addicted to a drug(s) they shouldn’t be treated as the drug dealer selling cocaine to your children but rather as someone who is sick that needs help</p>

<p>Believe it or not police officers are not the authority, although sometimes they think they are. And even if you commit a crime in front of an officer there is still the presumption of innocence unless proven guilty. If that were not true there would be no court trial and they would be jailed immediately. Since you are obliviously getting upset because you aren’t getting your own way I welcome you to prove me wrong with something other than your own opinion.</p>
<blockquote>INNOCENCE, PRESUMPTION OF - The indictment or formal charge against any person is not evidence of guilt. Indeed, the person is presumed by the law to be innocent. The law does not require a person to prove his innocence or produce any evidence at all. The Government has the burden of proving a person guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and if it fails to do so the person is (so far as the law is concerned) not guilty.</blockquote>
Find me an exception in the law that takes your constitution right of a trial by court away, please?
<p>It is all about assumptions and assertions. An assumption is a position that is not proven but because of the circumstances can be considered correct. An assertion is a claim made justifying the assumption. Now when the arresting officer cites you or charges you with something he is swearing to the courts that there is sufficient evidence to prove his assertion. After that you can either accept the charge(s) as being true or not and plead guilty or not guilty, when you plead not guilty you are challenging the prosecution’s assumption. Your presumption will prevail unless the party making the assertion can provide the link between the evidence presented and its claim. Without evidence a claim can not be proven and your presumption wins.</p>

        <p>I’ve broken my word by responding to this, but I just came to say one thing.</p>
<p>I don’t care how good you are with google, try to have an open mind and think more about what your talking about, and if you think hard enough, you’ll answer your own questions. If not, there is little hope for you.</p>
<p>And PaulT, before I lose connection with MITB again, if drug users would just get themselves to rehab where they will be helped, they won’t have to even risk getting arrested. Its just that simple.</p>
