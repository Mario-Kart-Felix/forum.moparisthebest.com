        <p>[quote=“PaulT, post:60, topic:120455”]When I say the job is inherently evil I mean that even if a good person becomes a cop they will have to enforce unjust laws, in other words promote evil. Hence a cop cannot be a good person. I don’t base the assumption that cops are fucking assholes on my own experience, just logical reasoning.</p>
<p>‘‘As long as there’s a lower class, I’m in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I am of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free.’’[/quote]</p>
<p>Wow, your my idol PaulT. But still, if I were to be a police officer, I know what it’s like to do drugs and stuff, and would try my best to help the person, not send them to prison. This cop was being an asshole to those kids, and thats the entire point of the thread.</p>

        <p>A lot of you seem to be falling for their social engineering. Obviously, they have to have done something before this bit of the video to have gotten themselves in trouble. Why can’t you guys accept the fact that they were most likely being their normal piss ant selves? PaulT, about having them go prevent rapists, that is not his job. His job is to patrol the area he is stationed to. If the little fuckers were breaking the law, he must enforce the rules. Now, how else would you have grabbed the girl? She is breaking the law by running away. Why should she be any different than any other criminal? When you break the law, you are punished accordingly. The law is injustice? How so? Drugs? Your hateful towards police because they arrest people who do drugs? They do not make the law, the enforce it. They are not our servants, they are law enforcement officers. They do not have mind reading capabilities, so how should they know if some 45 year old fucker decides he wants to become a pedophile and rapes a kid in the same day? If you do not like the laws, go take it up with Congress. Do not blame all the problems on the police.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or statements, I would be happy to continue this debate.</p>

Why should she be any different than any other criminal? When you break the law, you are punished accordingly.</blockquote>
<p>First, nobody is a criminal in that video, they are suspects. In America you must be proven guilty under a court of law before you become a criminal. To stop people from running from the police all reasonable force must be used, I agree. Yet reasonable force in this circumstance, where the officer is arresting people for skateboarding which is a <span class="bbcode-b">victimless crime</span>, seems like it should not be very much force at all.  Also, you confuse punishment, which is issued by a judge in a court of law, with preventative measures taken by police to detain a suspect, which are not ever to be punitive in nature. In this case excess force may or may not have been used, that I cannot say for certain, however I can say for sure that there are much better places for that police officer to be and more helpful things for him to be doing for society. When you break the law <span class="bbcode-b">and you are proven guilty</span> a judge decides what punishment you deserve.</p>
<blockquote>The law is injustice? How so?</blockquote>
<p>There are laws in this country that are incorrect and wrong. For example the rich are protected against the law while the poor are subject to the whim of the rich, drug addicts are treated as criminals instead of people who are sick, and groups such as blacks, gays, hispanics, and other minorities have been systematically discriminated against, and still are, under law. These are but a few small examples, there are countless others of the law protecting large corporations before the individual person, of the law bending to the will of those who can afford a certain lawyer, of politicians citing “Executive privelage” and etc…</p>
<blockquote>Drugs? Your hateful towards police because they arrest people who do drugs? They do not make the law, the enforce it. They are not our servants, they are law enforcement officers.</blockquote>
<p>I hate the police because they have chosen to become police officers even while they have the knowledge of the unfair and ridiculous laws in this counry. Drug laws are a good example because prohibition laws have been shown to be ineffective at helping people.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln said:<br>
“A Prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded.”</p>
<p>And I’m inclined to agree. You are right, police don’t make the laws, but they do choose to become police. The fact is that the police have a motto: “To protect and serve”.</p>
<blockquote>“To Protect and Serve” often translates into harass and control. Protecting the peace is not synonymous or equivalent to the enforcement of the law. Ordinary citizens live lives of voluntary respect for most laws. The threat of punishment or the fear of penalty does not infuse moral conduct. It is the ethos of the individual and their respective community, that produces law abiding citizens.</blockquote>
<p>If the police did not enforce the unjust laws then perhaps the kids in that video might have had enough respect for the force to simply go skateboard somewhere else after being asked. And, no matter how much they aggravated the cop, he should not have reacted in the violent impulsive way he did.</p>
<blockquote>They do not have mind reading capabilities, so how should they know if some 45 year old fucker decides he wants to become a pedophile and rapes a kid in the same day?</blockquote>
<p>Right, the police can’t read minds. Yet they can go and patrol somewhere with high crime rates. I have said it before and I’ll say it over and over if I have to, but there are many places where you can stand around and watch violent crime take place like clockwork, man. Some of these places aren’t too far from where I live. The police just can’t be pissed to go into the bad neighborhoods because they are afraid, just like anybody else.</p>
<blockquote>If you do not like the laws, go take it up with Congress. Do not blame all the problems on the police.</blockquote>
<p>I do write letters to my elected officials on issues I am passionate about, so please do not take that kind of pretentious peachy tone with me, especially not in a debate, an exchange of ideas, such as I hope we are engaged in at the moment. I don’t blame all problems on the police, but if they decided to stop enforcing dumb laws there wouldn’t be much the politicians could do about it.</p>

        <p>Please don’t take this debate the wrong way as: “Omfg PaulT you fag gtfo nobody gives a shit what you have to say”, because thats not how it is if the is how it appeared to you.</p>
<blockquote>First, nobody is a criminal in that video, they are suspects.</blockquote>
<p>They became criminals when they:</p>
<p>Failed to comply with the orders of the officer</p>
<p>Resisted arrest</p>
<p>Fled the scene</p>
<p>When the officer is there witnessing it and so is the entire public, that makes them instantly criminals</p>
<blockquote>To stop people from running from the police all reasonable force must be used, I agree. Yet reasonable force in this circumstance, where the officer is arresting people for skateboarding which is a victimless crime, seems like it should not be very much force at all.</blockquote>
<p>The officer is allowed to use the proper amount of force to catch the criminal when fleeing. In this case it would be restraint. They were resisting arrest and he used the necessary method to try and keep them at the scene.</p>
<blockquote>Also, you confuse punishment, which is issued by a judge in a court of law, with preventative measures taken by police to detain a suspect, which are not ever to be punitive in nature. In this case excess force may or may not have been used, that I cannot say for certain, however I can say for sure that there are much better places for that police officer to be and more helpful things for him to be doing for society. When you break the law and you are proven guilty a judge decides what punishment you deserve.</blockquote>
<p>I think I already summed that up.</p>
<blockquote>There are laws in this country that are incorrect and wrong. For example the rich are protected against the law while the poor are subject to the whim of the rich, drug addicts are treated as criminals instead of people who are sick, and groups such as blacks, gays, hispanics, and other minorities have been systematically discriminated against, and still are, under law. These are but a few small examples, there are countless others of the law protecting large corporations before the individual person, of the law bending to the will of those who can afford a certain lawyer, of politicians citing "Executive privelage" and etc..</blockquote>
<p>I agree with you on the first part, but on the case of drugs, if it has been made a law not to do it, and you are caught doing it, you are breaking the law and will be dealt with accordingly.</p>
<blockquote>I hate the police because they have chosen to become police officers even while they have the knowledge of the unfair and ridiculous laws in this country. Drug laws are a good example because prohibition laws have been shown to be ineffective at helping people.</blockquote>
<p>I think I also already summed this one up too. People join the force for a few reasons:</p>
<p>The pay is pretty good I hear</p>
<p>They want to help make community’s better for the law abiding citizens</p>
<p>And whatever else…</p>
<blockquote>If the police did not enforce the unjust laws then perhaps the kids in that video might have had enough respect for the force to simply go skateboard somewhere else after being asked. And, no matter how much they aggravated the cop, he should not have reacted in the violent impulsive way he did.</blockquote>
<p>I am willing to bet those kids really didn’t give a rat’s ass anyway. A lot of kids these days don’t seem to care unless they get in trouble. They become criminals by their actions and the cop at least tried to use the necessary force the catch them.</p>
<blockquote>Right, the police can't read minds. Yet they can go and patrol somewhere with high crime rates. I have said it before and I'll say it over and over if I have to, but there are many places where you can stand around and watch violent crime take place like clockwork, man. Some of these places aren't too far from where I live. The police just can't be pissed to go into the bad neighborhoods because they are afraid, just like anybody else.</blockquote>
<p>And you want to know why they are afraid? They usually get shot, and sometimes killed. I think its fair to stay alive and out of the area <span class="bbcode-i">until</span> called upon for duty.</p>
<blockquote>I do write letters to my elected officials on issues I am passionate about, so please do not take that kind of pretentious peachy tone with me, especially not in a debate, an exchange of ideas, such as I hope we are engaged in at the moment. I don't blame all problems on the police, but if they decided to stop enforcing dumb laws there wouldn't be much the politicians could do about it.</blockquote>
<p>Then they are the ones you should be blaming, not the law enforcement.</p>
<p>They simply do as they are told, or they lose their job.</p>
