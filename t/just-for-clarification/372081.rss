    <description>I&#39;ve bought a shared web hosting plan from hostgator and a domain from godaddy.

I&#39;m trying to link up my domain thats hosted by godaddy with my hosting on hostgator.

But I&#39;m a little confused with Name Servers / IP Address.

First of all I picked the cheapest hosting plan on hostgator 1 cent for a month haha yeah but it&#39;s only for 1 month then it will resume at 8$ a month.

After looking at the plans they are all in common.
Hatchling/Baby/Business 3 web hosting packages.
But only Business comes with a Free Dedicated IP.

So mines doesn&#39;t that means the IP Address will change and my site will go down?

Why this confuses me is when I logged into my CPanel it says the following

Package	Hatchling
IP Address	xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (blocked it out)
Server Name	gator1019
Name Servers
ns2037.hostgator.com
ns2038.hostgator.com
Home Directory	/home/xxxxxxxx
Operating System	Linux CentOS
Server Time	Dec 06 03:03 CST

The Name Servers are BOLD.
Here is a screenshot

Now the linking with godaddy without transferring the domain.

I went to the DNS Manager in godaddy.
Altered a record with the @ sign to my IP that CPanel provided.

ATM it&#39;s not doing anything probably takes 24 hours or something i&#39;ll check it out tommorrow..

But what i&#39;m confused about now is if the IP is dynamic how do I make it automatically update in the record or I must transfer it to hostgator? or I must change the Name Servers as well after all they are bold in the cPanel but I have no idea of their usefulness in my situation i just want to be able to let the site run automatically without any problems like hostgator server IP changing on me does that require Name Servers?

Well thats about sums it up thanks if anyone knows what I mean I appreciate it.

I decided to start my own forum too not RSPS related but something in TV shows/social stuff to generate income from adsense just as a experimental project for now.</description>

              <p>haha my bad nade i was in a hurry didn’t read what i wrote, yeah seems you are right about the Non-dedicated IP being shared because when I go to <a href="http://myip/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://myip/</a> it doesn’t show my website but going to <a href="http://myip/~username" rel="nofollow noopener">http://myip/~username</a> works.</p>
<p>Somehow idk how but when I just set the IP address at the @ Record it seemed to work I couldn’t understand why as the domain only redirects to the IP address yet it somehow knows its connected to my username? very strange but I guess they know since I registered hosting on that domain name that it points to <a href="http://myip/~username" rel="nofollow noopener">http://myip/~username</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways thanks alot guys all is working great i’ve changed the name servers to the hosting domains. Didn’t do that cPanel parked domain/add-on domain idk I think it’s done for me already.</p>

<p>Dude way to fuck up the grammar here. Non-dedicated IP means there are more than 1 hosting accounts sharing 1 IP address.</p>

              <p>And it was TL;DR, so if you haven’t already, you also have to add the domain to your hosting through cPanel (parked domain, add-on domain).</p>
