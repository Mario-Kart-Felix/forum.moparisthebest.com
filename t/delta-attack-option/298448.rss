    <title>Delta Attack Option</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-attack-option/298448</link>
    <description>Yea, i know alot of people are gonna say put an &quot;if&quot; statment around it. Well no that doesnt work, it doesnt appear until you re-log. How can i make the attack option appear for only wild zones and disapear after back out of the wild? Here is the code that makes the attack option (this is first time ive used delta, normally i wouldnt stick with one but it has alot beter stability than alot of servers)

[code]
outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
outStream.writeByteC(3);		// command slot (does it matter which one?)
outStream.writeByteA(1);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
outStream.writeString(&quot;Attack&quot;);
outStream.endFrameVarSize();
