    <title>718+ Client Connection Issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-client-connection-issues/538766</link>
    <description>Hello all.

First of all, I recently downloaded Fox2007&#39;s 718/753 Server but without the source. Many people, including me have been getting issues with connecting the client to that 718/753. Fox said that any 718+ client originally from Matrix can work.

Fox also said that all I needed to do is to change the SUB_REVISION in the Loader.java in my client to SUB_REVISION = 1, the client revision should be at 1, and the port should be at 43595.

As I did that, I still get a Js5 error and I already tried 4 clients out. When I use other RSPS sources, the 718+ Clients usually work. Any help please?

Here is a picture that I captured with the error:
