    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-creating-a-new-title/406421</link>
    <description>i want to create the donator title, so i wasnt quite sure how, i got one of my titles &quot;mem&quot; and i searched it, i copied the code every time i found &quot;member&quot; and pasted it right below and changed anything that said &quot;member in one of the 2 codes to donator, i did this in client, player, and player handler, now every time i try to create a new character it sorta goes to a black screen, and then logs out, if i try to log in it says your acc is already logged in, i go to my character files and nothing is there, (no new accs, if i try to log into an old acc same thing happens). the files will show up in my automatic save folder though. please help o in the auto save file and the character file &quot;member&quot; title is gone =/ please help thanks, o one last think if i try to add a command that requires you to be donator, it says variable not found..

thanks again</description>
