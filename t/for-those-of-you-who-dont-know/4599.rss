              <p>[quote=“Vipsta, post:19, topic:4599”]In reference to Sqigs comments:</p>
<p>I think you’re wrong. The people who become head of forums these days are mostly newbies. Obviously Fakawi, mopar, and maybe Sythe are the exceptions, the majority of administrators at websites like Dodian, rs2cheating, and RS-Server are all retards. Their newbies when it comes to RS Cheating. They become leaders because they pay the server bills (and bitch about it, at that!). They also are relatively new to the scene, and probably never played RSClassic, let alone experience the golden days of cheating. Those were the days of RuneBot, AutoRune, and towards the end of RSC’s life, the bot clones (When everyone had a bot source and was autoing).</p>
<p>These type of people that have become leaders dwell too much in RS stuff. They run black markets which cause scamming, greed, and hate. All of which destroy communities and pin cheaters against cheaters. That is probably why the community is so seperated now. Granted, the seperation makes us harder to kill, but it also makes it harder to create longstanding cheats.[/quote]</p>
<p>I suppose I agree to some extent that the large number of communities out there has fueled some distrust between individual communities however I don’t think that has much to do with the blackmarkets that have been run in those communities. One would say that the selling of bots and scripts is in itself a form of a black market, however, it has very few of the implications that you have mentioned. If I’m not mistaken, Scythe and Kaitnieks allowed sales of items other than bots as well and there were few adverse effects.</p>
<p>Regardless, something that really causes seperation in the communities is the lack of open source code. There are so many powerful scripters out there that are very helpful to the newer fellows who are trying to rise up. I myself am trying to learn a little bit about java and have pmed a number of the more well known scripters with short discrete messages but have yet to gain a simple reply such as a hello or how are you. I’d hope that they would take the initiative to help the upcoming programmers and strengthen the community, especially as seeing that a majority of them are moderators or administrators.</p>

              <p>In reference to Sqigs comments:</p>
<p>I think you’re wrong. The people who become head of forums these days are mostly newbies. Obviously Fakawi, mopar, and maybe Sythe are the exceptions, the majority of administrators at websites like Dodian, rs2cheating, and RS-Server are all retards. Their newbies when it comes to RS Cheating. They become leaders because they pay the server bills (and bitch about it, at that!). They also are relatively new to the scene, and probably never played RSClassic, let alone experience the golden days of cheating. Those were the days of RuneBot, AutoRune, and towards the end of RSC’s life, the bot clones (When everyone had a bot source and was autoing).</p>
<p>These type of people that have become leaders dwell too much in RS stuff. They run black markets which cause scamming, greed, and hate. All of which destroy communities and pin cheaters against cheaters. That is probably why the community is so seperated now. Granted, the seperation makes us harder to kill, but it also makes it harder to create longstanding cheats.</p>

This is going to be the new home of the srl devs, I am already setting it up, and getting us a repo at sourceforge, most all the devs at srl have agreed so its being done, I also may host the villavu forums as an archive, but that has not been decided yet. I am still working on everything.</p>
