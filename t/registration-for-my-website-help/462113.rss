    <description>Okay, so my major question is.. Where can I find a tutorial on.. This is hard to explain but.. Hopefully you&#39;ll get what I&#39;m after because I&#39;ve searched all through these forums and google and I have no idea what it would be called in a topic, so that doesn&#39;t help.. Sorry if there&#39;s already a topic on this, if there is.. please link me to it. So.. when someone registers on a runescape private server website, it creates their account in-game and it&#39;s with the same username and password. How would I go about doing this? I know it involves MySQL and PHP, but is there any tutorials? Thanks if anyone helps and rep++ to those who help.


Kind regards,

<p>You could always look up PHP file IO and just get it to create a text or binary file and have your server load these. Though if you want to do more than register accounts, such as high-scores or account editing you’d have to go with MySQL.</p>
