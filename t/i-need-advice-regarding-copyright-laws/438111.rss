    <title>I need advice regarding copyright laws</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-advice-regarding-copyright-laws/438111</link>
    <description>So there are tons of blogspot blogs out there sharing free download links to apk files of paid games and applications that have been running since early 2011 till today with about 3k posts and still doing their job staying online. Now that ofcourse is against the law and I know they will go down as soon as 1 person reports to Google.

My plan is different though. See I own a blog about an android device where I post my reviews of games and applications and how they run/if they are compatible with the device but linking to Android Market page. Till today I&#39;ve been doing that but I&#39;m sick of it.

I have planned to set up a disclaimer page containing this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every apk file of a game, application or live wallpaper posted here is of the free version that you can find on Android Market for free. This blog does not host/post any material that needs to be paid for to be used. If you are looking for a place to get paid games for free, this is not the place, I respect people&#39;s hard work put into something and I am not willing to share it for free.

If you are the developer and you want your game, application or live wallpaper deleted from my blog you may contact me at: mail@mail.mail

It is my policy to respond to any infringement notices and take appropriate actions. Material will be removed in less than 24 hours after contact.

It is your choice if you want the whole post removed, or have the apk download link replaced with the Android Market one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now as you can see, my intentions are not to post illegal download links to paid games and apps as the blogs I mentioned above, but links download links of apk files of games that are offered for free at the Android Market anyway.

I will also ofcourse check developer&#39;s websites and see their policies if they claim that they do not allow the distribution like that, if they say so, I won&#39;t and try to contact them for permission first, but if they don&#39;t have any page regarding that I will post an apk download link of their game. What are your opinions on this? Will such disclaimer and actions keep me off trouble?

An example is Angry Birds. [url=http://www.rovio.com/eula]http://www.rovio.com/eula[/url]
They do not allow the distribution and so I won&#39;t do it, I have contacted them anyway but I doubt they will give permission. But websites of the games that don&#39;t have such pages, I think I will link to apk download and only take it down if the developer wants me to.

What do you guys think?</description>

Look at moparscape. ;)[/quote]Yes exactly, I was about to use this forum as an example. My blog acts like a type of search engine to find suitable games, apps while nothing is being hosted there. I’ve read Thepiratebay’s excuses and that’s one of them that they get away with. It was at the wiki article about them I think.</p>
