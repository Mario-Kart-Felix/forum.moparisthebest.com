    <title>Need a client with LOTS of customs (non-renamed)!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-client-with-lots-of-customs-non-renamed/543219</link>
    <description>I need a client with LOTS of customs, it needs to be non-renamed so no itemdef, only class8. It needs to be easy to rip the customs from it, I.e there is nothing I need to decompile. I rather a client with actual customs and not just recolors, I do really need like one with 300+ in it like mikescape or project rainbow but I can&#39;t really rip the customs from them. Thanks in advance.</description>
