    <title>Not spawning NPCs vs dormit NPCs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/not-spawning-npcs-vs-dormit-npcs/262471</link>
    <description>Well, here&#39;s the general idea:

a) On the server start, I don&#39;t spawn all NPCs but add all the NPCLocs into an array (I&#39;ll call it &quot;notSpawnedNPCs&quot;). Then loop the array to see if any Players are around the &quot;would be&quot; NPC, and if they are, I&#39;ll spawn the NPC. Upon spawning, I&#39;ll remove them from the notSpawnedNPCs array and add them to npcs array. Same thing goes about respawning. 

b) Simply spawn all NPC at start, just like now. When they have to move, I&#39;ll check if anyone is around and if they are, I&#39;ll make the NPCs move. Otherwise they just sit dormit and do nothing. 

My question is... is A) really worth the trouble? Since NPCs don&#39;t do anything except attack/walk making them sit dormit will have the same effect as not spawning them. True, the npcs array would be shorter and looping it would be faster, but the &quot;notSpawnedNPCs&quot; array would have all the NPCs not spawned, meaning you&#39;ll have 2 arrays instead of 1 and the lenght of the 2 is equal to the 1.</description>

Well, this is a bad idea unless we implement the area system first.</p>
<p>Why the results varied that much:<br>
The check for players in view area checks the tiles of a 16x16 area, which causes the massive slowdown.</p>
<p>Area system + this would be win, cause all you’d have to do is getArea().getPlayers().size() &gt; 0 { spawn/move the NPCs in that area }</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
You’d potentially have to check two surrounding areas too (because players may be nearby but on the other side of a border).[/quote]<br>
yeah, in the end too much work for something you don’t know the outcome on.</p>

<p>Each gameengine loop (every 600ms) will iterate over every npc object, but.</p>
<p>public void updatePosition() {<br>

lastMovement = now;<br>

<p>It only moves them every 6 seconds, so there is 10:1 ratio of pointless loops.</p>
