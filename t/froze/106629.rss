and it just stays there...nothing happens, just frozen forever.


I did mess around with BonusName[] and the other stuff around there. but i had a backup and put it in...Still the samething happens, i redownloaded the moparscape client, still same error. i tried another server, pvpScape, and it worked! no freezing...idk did i really mess up my server that much? but i put in my backup and i didn&#39;t have that problem before...So anyhelp would really help, like how you bonusName[] looks like. post here! thanks!! alot</description>
