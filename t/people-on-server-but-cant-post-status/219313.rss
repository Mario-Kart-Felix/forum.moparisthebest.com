    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/people-on-server-but-cant-post-status/219313</link>
    <description>I was able to post my server status on moparscape but not on codefasga?  Any ideas?  my server is running, people are playing on it, and im 100% sure its not already on the codefasga list.  I&#39;ve checked it multiple times.  I attempt to post my server status and it says an unknown error has occurred.  Please help.</description>
