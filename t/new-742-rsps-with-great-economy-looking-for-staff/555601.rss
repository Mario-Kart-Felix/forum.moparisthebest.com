    <description>NEW SERVER WITH A GREAT ECONOMY! ~LOOKING FOR STAFF!~

and takes the communities&#39; recomendation and makes it happen.
	Our staff are experienced and active everyday to give you the
	best experience on Immersive.
Our mission is to create a server that fits your gaming style
from having multiple great bosses, flawless player-to-player combat,
staking, and gambling.

	our G.E. is 100% working, it is Player-To-Player so everything runs smoothly.
Our Duel Arena is fully working with staking.
	Immersive has a fully working Lending Item system to players.. 
We have fully working clans for the people that like to get 
with friends and pvm, or even player kill.
	There is a spirit tree at home that will teleport you around the world
 	to Skilling Zones, Bosses, Minigames, Player Killing, and Slayer.
All 24 skills work 100% with working Skill Capes and 200m XP skill capes.
We have just about every minigame you can think of working 100%!
	In Immersive 742 we have tons of training places for your skill level and for higher XP rates!
We have a trusted Gambling rank system with Anti-Scam features implemented.
	Immersives home is at the Grand Exchange and has tons of shops to fit all of
	your needs no matter what type of gaming you plan on doing!
