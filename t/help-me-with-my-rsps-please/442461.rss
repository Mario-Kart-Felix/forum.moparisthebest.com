    <title>Help me with my RSPS Please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-with-my-rsps-please/442461</link>
    <description>I need someone to help me with my 637 runescape private server! I&#39;m doing excellent with it but i&#39;m unable to do a few things like adding a donator / premium feature , I&#39;m not sure how to add the code , i tried :

if(command[0]=(&quot;givedonor&quot;));
     player.getRights() == 2);
     player.getRights() &gt; 1 %playername%
}else{
player.sendMessage(&quot;you do not have permission to execute this command&quot;)

I&#39;m not very educated in this type of area as i&#39;ve basically taught myself how to do everything , any help would be greatly appreciated!

I&#39;m also looking for someone to help me work on my server with me and I am willing to pay!

I also need help jar&#39;ing and signing my client and hosting it online, I&#39;ve tried to jar it and it worked fine , but the server doesn&#39;t run within the .jar process.

Anyone willing to help work with me on my server just add me on skype or messge me on here and ill add you , skype name : Darrenrulez1.</description>

Firstly sir, you are a dumbass. You need to learn who you elders are, I know Onix personally, his skill is much better than yours at any time. You need to listen to him and what he is telling you, were not gonna spoon-feed you. I would help you if you would learn some respect and not just assume you are better than someone when you are actually not.</p>

<p>there is one section of code in the commands.java that involves donor rights but I don’t think it was finished off or the system wasn’t complted because theres no code such as (“givedonor &amp;name&amp;”). heres the code thats in commands.java :</p>
<p>}<br>
if (player.getDonor() &gt; 0 || player.getRights() &gt;= 1) {<br>
donorCommands(player, command);<br>
}<br>
} catch (Throwable e) {<br>
e.printStackTrace();<br>

<pre><code>public static void donorCommands(final Player player, String[] command) {

	}

<p>I just don’t know how to implement a code to give other players the rights for donor status , could I be a pain in the ass and request your help again?</p>
