    <title>Do you think game companies and others are</title>

    <description>Do you think game companies and others are struggling to create new ideas? I know there are many possibilities that they can create for products, but I think that the &#39;originality&#39; of everything that is being made nowadays is declining, could it be the lack of thought and the speed at they consist to create new products just to sell faster? Or could it be the way in which they are thinking? I like seeing original things and now I see the amount of shit being bought out. I know there are original things still being made, but not AS original as it was.</description>
