    <description>[center][size=30pt]RuneWorld[/size][/center]
[center][i]The world is about to go rune![/i][/center]

[center]RuneWorld is an 317 Project all started by me, I&#39;m currently working on it a lot alone, but if your interested in helping me and have some Coding knowledge, just PM me, and I do have MSN. I&#39;ve decided to start off with an clean Devolution 2.7 base since I will be more likely be using its combat. This will be both PvP and Skilling based server that everyone can enjoy. Economy is based on fellow players, monsters and skilling. You have to either, kill monsters for its drops (Which you can sell to players for a heap of money according on how valuable it is) or Player killing (Kill players, take items, sell or keep, simple and effective). When it comes to skilling, the economy will be at its best, you have to fish for your own food, you have to cook your own food, you have to make your own potions, ectera. (Not counting trading with other players) A few of the features in this server will be custom-made minigames, decent skilling, near perfect combat(Not sure about if I actually do add full combat), full magic and maybe near future, full godwars. The only custom combat items added on the server will be Godswords (Rare), PvP armour (Extremely rare chance of getting when killing a player) and Dragon claws (Extremely rare).  Custom skilling items are not decided yet. Credits goes to Galkon for the Refactored Client Base. And Credits to glestrts for helping me with the server.

This topic will be updated with lasted news, updates and media from the server.

<p>Well, I can promise you that this server will be focused on the economy and features mostly. And thanks for posting. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Updates</span><br>
Changed Start and Respawn point to Lletya. (New home)<br>
You get about 1 piece of PvP equipment per 70 kills to keep it balanced. (Average)<br>
Still working on Nulling, flooding and syis.<br>
Gave up on firemaking, will be updating it later.<br>
Working on degradable PvP equipment. (A piece of PvP equipment will last 2 hours of combat, this will take some time to finish)</p>
<p>And if someone have some coding knowledge, I would appreciate if someone helped me.</p>

<p>[center]RuneWorld is an 317 Project all started by me, I’m currently working on it a lot alone, but if your interested in helping me and have some Coding knowledge, just PM me, and I do have MSN. I’ve decided to start off with an clean Devolution 2.7 base since I will be more likely be using its combat. This will be both PvP and Skilling based server that everyone can enjoy. Economy is based on fellow players, monsters and skilling. You have to either, kill monsters for its drops (Which you can sell to players for a heap of money according on how valuable it is) or Player killing (Kill players, take items, sell or keep, simple and effective). When it comes to skilling, the economy will be at its best, you have to fish for your own food, you have to cook your own food, you have to make your own potions, ectera. (Not counting trading with other players) A few of the features in this server will be custom-made minigames, decent skilling, near perfect combat(Not sure about if I actually do add full combat), full magic and maybe near future, full godwars. The only custom combat items added on the server will be Godswords (Rare), PvP armour (Extremely rare chance of getting when killing a player) and Dragon claws (Extremely rare).  Custom skilling items are not decided yet. Credits goes to Galkon for the Refactored Client Base. And Credits to glestrts for helping me with the server.</p>
<p>This topic will be updated with lasted news, updates and media from the server.</p>
