    <description>Once i compile the Client_src_svn folder&#39;s files. And receive the rsca.jar file, Right click - Open with Winrar, And i drag in which files and folders? At the moment nothing happens when i run it. I just get a big DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG in the background on my speakers. 

Can someone explain exactly which files i drag into the rsca.jar?

I&#39;ve tried dragging the lib folder from Client_src_svn into the rsca.jar aswell as the org folder from Client_src_svn/Src/Org. 

Still not working. If anyone has got this working can they explain it to me, Thank you.</description>
