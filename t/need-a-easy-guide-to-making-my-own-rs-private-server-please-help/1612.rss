    <description>This is ThatGuyWhoDoesStuff from the [LiTHIUM] scripting team and I am here to say I know nothing about making a RS server.

Thanx.[br][size=1]Posted at: April 19, 2006, 06:36:04 pm[/size][hr]Ok also I want to learn Java scripting. Im a novice scripter and I have a WoWEmu I develop (base files not by me, like I said Im a noobie) but after reading posts by you guys I am really interested in it.

Thanx guys.</description>
