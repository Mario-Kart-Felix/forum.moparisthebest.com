    <description>[b]The Main question is in bold.[/b] 

I am the owner of the server &quot;Sn0wbreeze&quot; that used to be on the front page of Rswebclients.com&#39;s server list. 6th-8th place. Now the server was going nowhere and I got lazy on coding because it was pointless to continue coding for a dead server. The source I was using was too broken and so I got a better lower revision of a server that&#39;s fully functional. Now I&#39;m making Sn0wbreeze V2 with a client and [b]I need help to figure out how to make a part of the Wilderness a safe spot?[/b] The original source had it has a safe spot already. The trees and banks are there in the home already.
