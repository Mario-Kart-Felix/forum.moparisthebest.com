    <title>Help with smf</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-smf/338355</link>
    <description>Alright I have the smfforfree forums.
What I want to do is change the tabs at the top, like add on to it and make them what every I want.
Like; &quot;home&quot; help&quot; &quot;serach&quot; &quot;profile&quot; &quot;my messages&quot; &quot;irc chat&quot; and so on...

Another thing is how would i make it so i can upload like a cache to them and such.

Another thing I know this isit the right section but i hosnlty wouldnt know what one to put it in..
PS: I really need help with adding on my own tabs to the top of smfforfree forums and being able to do anything to them.</description>
