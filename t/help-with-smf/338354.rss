    <description>I hosntly don&#39;t know witch topic this would go in if any at all. . .
So sorry.

But what I need help with is I&#39;m using &quot;smfforfree&quot; and I deleted a message with my friends help, and I forget his name, but how would i make this happen, add tabs at the top, upload stuff like cache to them. in the smfforfree forums.
Like make custom tabs up their, when you click I can do w/e to the page.
I&#39;ll post a picture if you don&#39;t understand, its like the tabs at the top of this forums,
&quot;home&quot; &quot;help&quot; &quot;search&quot; &quot;profile&quot; &quot;my messages&quot; &quot;irc chat&quot; &quot;calendar&quot; &quot;members&quot; &quot;logout&quot;</description>
