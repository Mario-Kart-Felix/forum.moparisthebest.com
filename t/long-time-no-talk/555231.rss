    <description>Hello Moparscape.


I&#39;ve been AFK for a while now and thought I&#39;d give an update of what I&#39;ve been doing to the people who give a fuck!

July 27th 2015 I went to the Navy bootcamp, the Dr there said I broke my leg( he finally looked at the X-Ray and realized he was an idiot) so instead of being at BC for 8 weeks I was there 14. I am currently stationed in the US as a logistics specialist and doing IT work as a collateral duty.

For those who knew, I am still married but probably getting a divorce soon, i&#39;m not fretting over that shit though.

I&#39;ve been trying to pick the guitar up again lately and below this you can find a video of myself and a friend singing/jamming out.

If you knew me drop a comment and say hello, or if you didn&#39;t know me say hello anyways asshole!
It&#39;s nice to see the community still going!

<p>Hey Jal I think we met once. Did you work for the Divination of the gods server a year ago? You do web developing I think if I remember correctly. If not Hi anyways lol. Sorry about the Broken leg mate that sucks. Are you going back into the RSPS scene at all?</p>

<p>Hey! Yeah I did some work for them a while back.</p>
<p>I’m not sure If I will be or not. I’ve kind of been stalking the site for the past week now tbh so I may jump back in. My web devo skills have advanced a lot due to school so I may try to help some people out with it.</p>
