    <title>Why do all servers need their own client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-do-all-servers-need-their-own-client/381996</link>
    <description>I want to host a server again, but all the sources I find is sources which you need the client for to play. Does this means that everyone who wants to join my server has to download the client? Why have it become like this?</description>

Do you realize that all of the sponsored servers you have obviously are going to have custom items and NPC’s not on your client? People won’t want to play with those servers. Or any server with your client.<br>

Many servers say they need their own client, but allow connections from MoparScape.</p>
<p>Also in the near future, all servers on the server status page will be required to use MoparScape.<br>
