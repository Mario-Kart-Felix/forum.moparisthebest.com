    <title>Multi Agression</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multi-agression/284397</link>
    <description>Alright, so I was trying to make a code for multi agression. I wanted to use random to make the npc choose a random person but that won&#39;t work. The problem is that it chooses the first person that is near and stays on that one, no matter what. I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to make it choose the closest one, even if it has a target, so like making it change targets. The only way I can think of doing that is using the process() but that would cause a lot of lag. Is there any other way?</description>

              <p>Make it recognize when there are multiple targets within its range, and do some math to figure out its new target, and you probably could use the math in process().</p>
