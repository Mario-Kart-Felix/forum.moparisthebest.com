    <title>Object map files</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/object-map-files/546472</link>
    <description>So i went into objectdef.java and dumped what im guessing is the map object files into a folder in the cache. They all come out as .dats how would i convert these to txt files? Because just changing the file extension to txt the text file becomes blank and changing the writefile to .txt instead of .dat makes it blank as well. Would i need to change it to a cfg file? Also what is the difference between a cfg and txt file? I  feel like im doing something completely wrong but im code retarded so thats okay. I just want better knowledge of how objects are added to the map through the client/cache</description>

You’d want to see how the client parses it then edit the values accordingly. I don’t think you should change their format to text though…<br>

<p>Thanks for replying, but yea im code retarded so what do you mean how the client parses it? Like see how the client reads the data coming from the .dat files?[/quote]<br>
Take a look at the readvalue method in objectdef. I believe that’s the one that handles all objects.</p>
