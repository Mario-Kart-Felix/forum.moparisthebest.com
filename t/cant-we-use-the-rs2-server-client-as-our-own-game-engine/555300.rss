    <title>Can&#39;t we use the RS2 server/client as our own game engine?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-we-use-the-rs2-server-client-as-our-own-game-engine/555300</link>
    <description>Title says it all.

I&#39;m not really that active in the rsps-development scene so my knowledge about this topic might not be all that accurate.

However, I wonder why people tend to keep the gameplay of their servers as close to RS2 as they possibly could?
Is this due to most projects being done by incompetent programmers - under which category I also fall, or are there other reasons I&#39;m just not aware of?

A while ago I seem to remember someone releasing a RSPS based on a The Hunger Games scenario.
Why don&#39;t people throw away the concept of staying as close to the real game as they can, and start experimenting with what their own creativity offers?

As the RSPS community seems to keep on declining, this might be a nice twist?</description>

              <p>It’s what players demand. Most of the server advertisements (especially sponsored ones) you come across flaunt their “new” content, that’s ripped straight from OSRS. When a player connects to a new server, if it doesn’t have Kraken, Blowpipe, Zulrah, etc; they instantly leave. It’s pretty pathetic.</p>
<p>I tried to be unique with Epicurus, and it did gain me a sizeable playerbase initally, but masses of people would leave when I refused to add content from the latest Runescape release. Of course I eventually gave in. It’s all about keeping up with Runescape, if you want players.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the replies guys.</p>
<p>I may have used the term ‘Game Engine’ wrongly.</p>
<p>With Game Engine I wasn’t really pointing to the ability to change the client’s graphics. Which I think you mean by talking about understanding how the renderer works, Sini?</p>
<p>Also, I know there are free opensource Game Engines on the market.<br>
I’ve been recently experimenting with Unity and the Google Cardboard SDK to create some VR-games - oh god imagine Runescape in Virtual Reality?</p>
<p>What I was actually talking about is probably better described as a different goal of the game using the same graphics, items and such.<br>
Like, take the Hunger Games scenario I was talking about earlier. You wouldn’t need the skills and leveling and such, only a basic but good combat experience and some objects over the map. Spawning some mobs randomly over the terrain doesn’t seem like a hard thing to do in a server?</p>

              <p>actually a few people have used it, at the very least newbiehacker used a portion of the rs engine to write an isometric engine im not sure if the source can still be found on these boards but its worth a gander.  Also I believe someone on r-s was also using the RS engine for his own project however I do not know how far it went.  If you want the easy way out don’t use the runescape engine directly Jagex had a few games prior to runescape on its site one of them was qbert clone. Although this engine is not as complex as Runescape 2 it has a similar feel and would work fine for easily creating your own single player game. The source to it has been posted on these boards a few times both refactored and not. The bigger issue at hand is if you are going to put the time and energy into creating a game you don’t want to get fucked over stealing someone elses copyrighted engine as you will be putting your work into the garbage once Jagex catches on.  You have plenty of free opensource game engines to choose from so you should have no need to use the RS engine directly.  That being said you can learn a lot by playing around with the engine as Jagex is quite resourceful when it comes to making their engine run smoothly on minimal hardware (I am speaking of anything prior to the whole clusterflutter era and the shitty stringwrapper era so anything below 508)</p>

              <p>Cause its a lot of work. Like not even joking. To probably understand how the renderer works you need to at least have finished calculus 2, or just study matrices, affine transformations, vectors. These are all pieces of linear algebra and you can take a kahn academy class for the basics. But anyway, these also a lot of design principles in the client and if you dont adhere to how jagex laid out the client it’ll just be like starting from scratch. It isn’t plug and play, you have to figure out the method to their madness. Plus a lot of modern engines use GL or DX; that of which isn’t as well understand in the more recent builds of runescape compared to the old ones (but funnily enough I find it easier to understand whats going on in the GL renderers than the inhouse because there are plenty of resources on the subject, jagex also tended to optimize the matrix operations so it isn’t as obvious).</p>
<p>A lot of games started as mods to a game. That will probably happen to Runescape eventually. A hunger games server isn’t really that, its more or less just a game mode of Runescape like DMM.</p>
