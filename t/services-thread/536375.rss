              <p>[quote=“Flame_, post:2, topic:536375”]As long as the only transactions done are through RuneScape currency (it would probably be best to only do currency from RS07 to RS07 accounts), there shouldn’t be any problem with it. What would you have in mind?[/quote]No, this is incorrect. RS currency is no different than IRL currency when it comes to our no buying/selling rule. Just as bitcoin, world of warcraft gold, or any other currency would not be allowed.</p>
<p>OP’s answer: no.</p>
<p>To clarify the rules:</p>
<blockquote>No discussing loaning of money or items (exception is the built-in runescape lending system, since you can't be scammed with it).
<p>No buying or selling of anything outside of the RuneScape trading system. This includes asking for price checks on things you wish to sell for real money or other forms of currency.</p>
<p>Buying, selling, and trading using the official RuneScape trading system is allowed, as long as no other forms of currency are exchanged. The staff reserve the right to remove posts and/or threads if they deem the trade is a scam or illegitimate for any reason.</p>
</blockquote><br>
The first one means you can use the RS lending system as it is intended.
<p>The second one means you can buy/sell as long as BOTH sides are in RS items (for example a topic selling herbs for rsgp is allowed).</p>
<p>The third is just clarification of the second, meaning you can’t buy or sell ANYTHING on these forums for RSGP if either of the people is getting/giving something outside of the game itself (example: services).</p>

              <p>I wouldn’t allow it, services for any type of payment are prohibited here and you’ve been here long enough to know that. This may not be directly in the rules but the rules state they are guidelines, not to be looked through for loopholes and exploited.</p>
<p>I would put a no down. Advertising services even though the payments aren’t done through moparscape is still illegal. The entire point of this rule is to stop people blaming moparscape for being scammed, finding customers on here and then scamming them elsewhere still comes back on is therefore this is prohibited.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you’re going to scam them, that’s just one of the scenarios that bring bad press to us.</p>
