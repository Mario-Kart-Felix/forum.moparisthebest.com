Siberium is a 474 project, we have been working on this for a few weeks now, 
adding multiple features trying to have as much unique content as possible.

[b]16/5/14[/b]
- Started Hunter base
- Added Weaponry (See section in crafting skill guide)
- Finished Pottery base
- Started Pottery base
- Added glassblowing base. Going to redo it. Just wanted a mockup.
- Fixed skill guides. Clicking the tabs in each guide didn&#39;t work.
- Made smithing require a hammer.
- Made it so you cannot open any interface while in combat.
- Finished new emote handler.
- Fixed hair showing through wig
- Added working lumbridge stairs
- Modified lumbridge doors so all doors are wooden and not stone.

[B]7/5/14[/B]
- Experience lamps - The herblore icon was offset by a few pixels to the top. I&#39;ve moved it back down to the center-ish area.
- Spellbooks - While I&#39;m not totally finished with the spellbooks, I rewrote the system that handles how your player switches books. Before it was messy and handled of multiple classes and it&#39;s now all handled in one.
- Skill guides - I have also rewrote how the guides are opened as well. All guides are working and display the correct information.
- Barrows - Before when you went into the crypts, it would draw 5 or 6 funky diagonal lines over the map. Now it totally disables the map as it should.
- Teleports - All spell teleports have been rewrote. You now need runes (hover the spell to see what ones) in order to teleport. There was a small bug where you could spam click the buttons and waste your runes, but that is no longer an issue.

[B]3/5/14[/B]
- Player Accounts now save 2x faster (not noticeable to the player, but very noticeable in terms of system usage).
- Players can now correctly add a person to their ignore list. The ignore feature also now works (player won&#39;t be able to send a message to you). - Have to add public chat denying still.
- Recently re-did clan chat, so that should be running smoother and faster (in terms of updating players and information displayed on the interface).
- The entire settings tab now works. Players can properly choose split chat, run toggle, chat effects, and mouse button preferences.
- Your split chat preference now saves to the player profile. 
- All Skillcape emotes now work. If you&#39;re walking, the system will properly stop your player to perform the emote.
- Changed the text in the quest tab to green (more of a welcoming feeling haha). 
- Fixed the issue where players would not receive 250k from the lumbridge guide if their inventory was full.
- Fixed up item switching. Now proper and efficient. 
- All orbs (HP, Prayer, and Run) now decrease (the orb filling) as your points go down.
- You can toggle your run on/off simply by clicking the orb.
- Hover texts have been added to the rank and teleport button.
- The split chat saving feature will be operational.
- Hover texts on the quest tab have been changed (so you don&#39;t see quest names).
- You can now right click a player&#39;s name in the public chat or private chat, and if they&#39;re your friend, you can choose to &quot;Message&quot; them back.

[B]27/4/14[/B]
Fishing:
- Re-wrote the system.
- System is now properly timed and grants users a catch based on how high their level is above the level of fish they&#39;re catching. For example, if a player&#39;s fishing level is 70 and they&#39;re trying to catch lobster, which is level 40 requirement, they have a level 30 difference, which means they&#39;ll catch lobster more often. 
- Each catch (both failed and successful catches) have a chance to yield a seaweed. 
- Future updates include random moving fishing spots &amp; random caskets.

Prayer:
- Re-wrote the altar and bone burying system. 
- Proper animations, timing, and graphics on the altar. 
- Altar grants 2x experience over burying the bone. 

[B]25/4/14[/B]
- Lists categories and 12 teleports corresponding to each category.
- Once you click a category, it will save to your profile. Each time you re-open the interface, the category will automatically be on the previous one you used to teleport in the past. Works even if you log out.
- The icon to access this system is located right under the run orb, as seen by the scroll.

[b]19/4/14[/b]
The home area is nearing completion.
[ul][*]Added all doors, objects, and most village npcs that relate to our home.
[*]Shops, essential npc&#39;s and attackable monsters were moved appropriately to the new home.[/ul]

Searchables system:
[ul][*]You can now search any object that has the &quot;Search&quot; option across the world! This includes crates, bookcases, drawers, ect.
[*]Each searchable has a random chance of finding loot. If loot is found, the crate has a reset time before any player has a *chance* of using it again.
[*]Rewards are based on luck. You will get 3 random items of different quantities for every successful search.[/ul]

Stairs &amp; Ladders:
[ul][*]I&#39;ve added an all new stairs and ladders system that&#39;s efficient. If a staircase or ladder is missing, a message should pop up that says &quot;Report stairs/ladder to a staff member&quot; so that we may add it.[/ul]

Intoxication:
[ul][*]Since there&#39;s a bar in town, we thought we&#39;d add a bartender along with a few alcoholic beverages. ;)
[*]Drinking enough alcohol will raise your intoxication level and eventually make your player walk &#39;drunk&#39;. See media below.
[*]The more alcohol you drink, the longer it will last.
[*]Future additions to this content include: intoxication meter, temporary loss of certain stats, and uncontrollable walking.[/ul]


[b]17/4/14[/b]
- Doors fixed up the original door system included in the source so that it&#39;s more efficient &amp; the features are far better. 
Unlike before, a majority of doors now work in Siberium. The system however doesn&#39;t account for all of the doors across the world. There&#39;s a more than likely chance that you&#39;ll run into a door that doesn&#39;t work properly. Please report the door on the forums along with the location.
- 1 Click door operations. The old system had it so that you would click to walk up to a door, but would have to click an additional time to open the door. We&#39;ve integrated it all into 1 click. 
- Region door updating fixed. An old error causing the doors not to reload upon switching regions has been fixed.
- Bank Deposit Box:
Fully functional, all features of the box supported. Pictures below.

[B]14/4/14[/B]
Welcome to the Siberium &quot;Vote 4 Rewards&quot; it is a very simple and easy to use feature. The system was made with simplicity in mind. 

- The interface below is self-explanatory. You click the button at the bottom which will redirect you to a RuneLocus page that will ask you to enter a captcha code, then click &quot;Vote&quot;. Then you&#39;re done! Our servers will automatically process and validate your vote and add it to your account whether it&#39;s online or offline. 
- The interface will also tell you if Runelocus will allow you to vote (since it&#39;s only allowed every 12 hours). 
- The server checks for votes every 1-5 minutes, allowing the server to function properly whilst under heavy load. 

[B]12/4/14[/B]
Introducing the Nobility Ranking System. It&#39;s very simple and the picture is self-explanatory, to obtain the next nobility rank, you have to complete the 5 challenges listed. It changes for every rank and gets extremely hard the more ranks you gain. At the moment, there&#39;s no benefits to each rank, but we&#39;re 100% positively looking to implement benefits for each rank. 

Upon the beta release, there will be 3 obtainable nobility ranks for players to &#39;have at&#39;.
Upon the real release, there will be 5 ranks to obtain. 
In the future, shortly after the real release, we&#39;re planning to have a total of 16 nobility ranks that a player can obtain. 

- Nobility rank shows up on the interface along with where the world map button used to be. 
- You can also click the rank (world map), to access the interface.

- Running orb &amp; run toggle box now properly unhighlights when your energy depletes.
- Fletching is roughly 80% complete. Need to add bow-stringing support &amp; make # interfaces for fletching headless arrows and bolts.

[B]9/4/14[/B]
- Added high scores ready for release when it comes around.
- Began donation system
- Cleaned source
- Repackaged source

[B]7/4/14[/B]
- Bought IPB license
- Set up forums
- Added a portion to the login screen that shows the server status and number of players online.

[B]4/4/14[/B]
- New login box added
- New client background added
- New client frame added

[B]26/03/14[/B]
- Clan Chat (adds new users auto)
- 100% clipping
- Reworked formulas
- Basic teleports
- All added boss work
- Godwars with kill count to enter boos rooms
- Duel arena with working restrictions
- Barrows with working kill count and rewards room
- Castle wars (nearly finished)

[Spoiler=Updates]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">16/5/14</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Started Hunter base</li>
<li>Added Weaponry (See section in crafting skill guide)</li>
<li>Finished Pottery base</li>
<li>Started Pottery base</li>
<li>Added glassblowing base. Going to redo it. Just wanted a mockup.</li>
<li>Fixed skill guides. Clicking the tabs in each guide didn’t work.</li>
<li>Made smithing require a hammer.</li>
<li>Made it so you cannot open any interface while in combat.</li>
<li>Finished new emote handler.</li>
<li>Fixed hair showing through wig</li>
<li>Added working lumbridge stairs</li>
<li>Modified lumbridge doors so all doors are wooden and not stone.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/8OoKG.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[B]7/5/14[/B]</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience lamps - The herblore icon was offset by a few pixels to the top. I’ve moved it back down to the center-ish area.</li>
<li>Spellbooks - While I’m not totally finished with the spellbooks, I rewrote the system that handles how your player switches books. Before it was messy and handled of multiple classes and it’s now all handled in one.</li>
<li>Skill guides - I have also rewrote how the guides are opened as well. All guides are working and display the correct information.</li>
<li>Barrows - Before when you went into the crypts, it would draw 5 or 6 funky diagonal lines over the map. Now it totally disables the map as it should.</li>
<li>Teleports - All spell teleports have been rewrote. You now need runes (hover the spell to see what ones) in order to teleport. There was a small bug where you could spam click the buttons and waste your runes, but that is no longer an issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MK5izqP.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[B]3/5/14[/B]</p>
<ul>
<li>Player Accounts now save 2x faster (not noticeable to the player, but very noticeable in terms of system usage).</li>
<li>Players can now correctly add a person to their ignore list. The ignore feature also now works (player won’t be able to send a message to you). - Have to add public chat denying still.</li>
<li>Recently re-did clan chat, so that should be running smoother and faster (in terms of updating players and information displayed on the interface).</li>
<li>The entire settings tab now works. Players can properly choose split chat, run toggle, chat effects, and mouse button preferences.</li>
<li>Your split chat preference now saves to the player profile.</li>
<li>All Skillcape emotes now work. If you’re walking, the system will properly stop your player to perform the emote.</li>
<li>Changed the text in the quest tab to green (more of a welcoming feeling haha).</li>
<li>Fixed the issue where players would not receive 250k from the lumbridge guide if their inventory was full.</li>
<li>Fixed up item switching. Now proper and efficient.</li>
<li>All orbs (HP, Prayer, and Run) now decrease (the orb filling) as your points go down.</li>
<li>You can toggle your run on/off simply by clicking the orb.</li>
<li>Hover texts have been added to the rank and teleport button.</li>
<li>The split chat saving feature will be operational.</li>
<li>Hover texts on the quest tab have been changed (so you don’t see quest names).</li>
<li>You can now right click a player’s name in the public chat or private chat, and if they’re your friend, you can choose to “Message” them back.</li>
</ul>

<p>[B]27/4/14[/B]<br>
Fishing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-wrote the system.</li>
<li>System is now properly timed and grants users a catch based on how high their level is above the level of fish they’re catching. For example, if a player’s fishing level is 70 and they’re trying to catch lobster, which is level 40 requirement, they have a level 30 difference, which means they’ll catch lobster more often.</li>
<li>Each catch (both failed and successful catches) have a chance to yield a seaweed.</li>
<li>Future updates include random moving fishing spots &amp; random caskets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prayer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-wrote the altar and bone burying system.</li>
<li>Proper animations, timing, and graphics on the altar.</li>
<li>Altar grants 2x experience over burying the bone.</li>
</ul>
<p>[B]25/4/14[/B]</p>
<ul>
<li>Lists categories and 12 teleports corresponding to each category.</li>
<li>Once you click a category, it will save to your profile. Each time you re-open the interface, the category will automatically be on the previous one you used to teleport in the past. Works even if you log out.</li>
<li>The icon to access this system is located right under the run orb, as seen by the scroll.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">19/4/14</span><br>
The home area is nearing completion.<br>
[ul][<em>]Added all doors, objects, and most village npcs that relate to our home.<br>
[</em>]Shops, essential npc’s and attackable monsters were moved appropriately to the new home.[/ul]</p>
<p>Searchables system:<br>
[ul][<em>]You can now search any object that has the “Search” option across the world! This includes crates, bookcases, drawers, ect.<br>
[</em>]Each searchable has a random chance of finding loot. If loot is found, the crate has a reset time before any player has a <em>chance</em> of using it again.<br>
[*]Rewards are based on luck. You will get 3 random items of different quantities for every successful search.[/ul]</p>
<p>Stairs &amp; Ladders:<br>
[ul][*]I’ve added an all new stairs and ladders system that’s efficient. If a staircase or ladder is missing, a message should pop up that says “Report stairs/ladder to a staff member” so that we may add it.[/ul]</p>
<p>Intoxication:<br>
[ul][<em>]Since there’s a bar in town, we thought we’d add a bartender along with a few alcoholic beverages. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
[</em>]Drinking enough alcohol will raise your intoxication level and eventually make your player walk ‘drunk’. See media below.<br>
[<em>]The more alcohol you drink, the longer it will last.<br>
[</em>]Future additions to this content include: intoxication meter, temporary loss of certain stats, and uncontrollable walking.[/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">17/4/14</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Doors fixed up the original door system included in the source so that it’s more efficient &amp; the features are far better.<br>
Unlike before, a majority of doors now work in Siberium. The system however doesn’t account for all of the doors across the world. There’s a more than likely chance that you’ll run into a door that doesn’t work properly. Please report the door on the forums along with the location.</li>
<li>1 Click door operations. The old system had it so that you would click to walk up to a door, but would have to click an additional time to open the door. We’ve integrated it all into 1 click.</li>
<li>Region door updating fixed. An old error causing the doors not to reload upon switching regions has been fixed.</li>
<li>Bank Deposit Box:<br>
Fully functional, all features of the box supported. Pictures below.</li>
</ul>
<p>[B]14/4/14[/B]<br>
Welcome to the Siberium “Vote 4 Rewards” it is a very simple and easy to use feature. The system was made with simplicity in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>The interface below is self-explanatory. You click the button at the bottom which will redirect you to a RuneLocus page that will ask you to enter a captcha code, then click “Vote”. Then you’re done! Our servers will automatically process and validate your vote and add it to your account whether it’s online or offline.</li>
<li>The interface will also tell you if Runelocus will allow you to vote (since it’s only allowed every 12 hours).</li>
<li>The server checks for votes every 1-5 minutes, allowing the server to function properly whilst under heavy load.</li>
</ul>
<p>[B]12/4/14[/B]<br>
Introducing the Nobility Ranking System. It’s very simple and the picture is self-explanatory, to obtain the next nobility rank, you have to complete the 5 challenges listed. It changes for every rank and gets extremely hard the more ranks you gain. At the moment, there’s no benefits to each rank, but we’re 100% positively looking to implement benefits for each rank.</p>
<p>Upon the beta release, there will be 3 obtainable nobility ranks for players to ‘have at’.<br>
Upon the real release, there will be 5 ranks to obtain.<br>
In the future, shortly after the real release, we’re planning to have a total of 16 nobility ranks that a player can obtain.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nobility rank shows up on the interface along with where the world map button used to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also click the rank (world map), to access the interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running orb &amp; run toggle box now properly unhighlights when your energy depletes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fletching is roughly 80% complete. Need to add bow-stringing support &amp; make # interfaces for fletching headless arrows and bolts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[B]9/4/14[/B]</p>
<ul>
<li>Added high scores ready for release when it comes around.</li>
<li>Began donation system</li>
<li>Cleaned source</li>
<li>Repackaged source</li>
</ul>
<p>[B]7/4/14[/B]</p>
<ul>
<li>Bought IPB license</li>
<li>Set up forums</li>
<li>Added a portion to the login screen that shows the server status and number of players online.</li>
</ul>
<p>[B]4/4/14[/B]</p>
<ul>
<li>New login box added</li>
<li>New client background added</li>
<li>New client frame added</li>
</ul>
<p>[B]26/03/14[/B]</p>
<ul>
<li>Clan Chat (adds new users auto)</li>
<li>100% clipping</li>
<li>Reworked formulas</li>
<li>Basic teleports</li>
<li>All added boss work</li>
<li>Godwars with kill count to enter boos rooms</li>
<li>Duel arena with working restrictions</li>
<li>Barrows with working kill count and rewards room</li>
<li>Castle wars (nearly finished)<br>
