    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-i-really-need-some-help-317/338083</link>
    <description>1. When i wear a bronze dagger and attack with it, the dagger vanishes, i attack with my hands, and the dagger comes back in my hand. If i&#39;m right, it&#39;s because i have to add an animation to it. But how do i do that? And does anyone maybe have a list of the animations...?

2. When i change the item name in item.cfg, will it really change too? I mean, do i have to do it in item.cfg, or somewhere else?

3. How can i do that (in case 53), that when u use like... an egg, pot of flour or milk on a cake tin, it will check if you have the other items needed in your inventory, if you don&#39;t have it, it will send you a message, if you have it, the 4 items (egg, pot of flour, milk and cake tin) will go, and you get an uncooked cake.</description>

<p>How can i do that (in case 53), that when u use like… an egg, pot of flour or milk on a cake tin, it will check if you have the other items needed in your inventory, if you don’t have it, it will send you a message, if you have it, the 4 items (egg, pot of flour, milk and cake tin) will go, and you get an uncooked cake.[/quote]</p>

<li>
<p>Depends on where your combat is handled. In client.java or in combat &gt; npccombat/playercombat.java</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class8 in your client.</p>

</ol>
<p><code>if(!playerHasItemAmount(###, 1) &amp;&amp; !playerHasItemAmount(###, 1) &amp;&amp; !playerHasItemAmount(###, 1) {
sendMessage("You need an egg, pot of flour, and a cake tin to make this!");
