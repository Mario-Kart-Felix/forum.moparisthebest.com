    <title>My proposal to fix MoparScape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-proposal-to-fix-moparscape/369833</link>
    <description>Upon reading this topic title, I safely assume that you went &quot;oh, not this again&quot; . And now that you&#39;ve read that, you probably giggled like an idiot or pulled/continued pulling a serious face. That aside, this is time for a serious debate and the following shall be the opening argument.

If you&#39;re just going to post, think twice. If the post is just a statement agreeing to whatever anyone said in this thread, don&#39;t post. If the post is of irrelevant material, don&#39;t post as well. I understand that, after skimming through a few topics by moderators of the site, MoparScape has experienced mainly two types of moderation: lenient and strict.

Let&#39;s look around the forum and identify what species of people on the forum MoparScape unfortunately (and fortunately at the same time) embodies. Don&#39;t worry, I have come up with a list to save the hassle.

[ul][li]People who ask pointless questions with answers already obvious[/li]
[li]People who don&#39;t know where to post[/li]
[li]People who ask answered questions[/li]
[li]People who hang out in general discussion boards[/li][/ul]

The past two months saw the promotion of two members of the site to moderators. Yes, like other moderators, they are doing what they&#39;re expected to do. The moderators here are doing the jobs of a typical moderator. However, they aren&#39;t doing the jobs of a competent moderator.

As long as these people with their type of questions as stated above continue to exist on the forum, MoparScape will continue to remain in her current state. The help boards will, uninterruptedly, be flooded with questions that have been asked for already three years and questions with answers in a sticky on a board.

Put short, enforce, if not strict, harsh moderation (like what Rich and Tico did). This idea, albeit a non-friendly one, will show its results in the long run (that is, if it is used and continues to do so): possibly transform the people into more intellegient beings. I am not challenging the staff team&#39;s logic by means of telling what it is doing now is wrong but more aptly put, I am suggesting what the members of the staff team should start doing again.

And so I quote one of the forum rules:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Rule 3:[/b]
Posts should be knowledgeable, try to put some effort into them, it&#39;ll save hassle and stop you from looking like an idiot.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Whenever someone posts a new topic that asks question which already has answers to or has been answered, ask them to use the search feature or look around the Help board for similar topics. If they fail to do so, give them a stern warning. Their topics should also contain some information on what they have attempted to solve the problem. I mean, if they aren&#39;t going to help themselves in the first place, who will? If this idea is implemented again, let&#39;s have a look at MoparScape in 2012.

[ul][li][url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html]Everyone asks smart questions[/url][/li]
[li]The help boards only comprise of legitimate questions.[/li][/ul]

I also put forward one of my suggestions. It is to install the [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1601]Topic Solved modification[/url] on the help board. This mod adds the feature of marking a topic solved or unsolved. To make this change (if ever) more efficient, prune all the old posts in the help boards so other members don&#39;t go through the hassle of searching through thousands of pages.

To conclude, I am suggesting that moderators enforce strict moderation and that the package above should be installed. I *would* be surprised if a similar topic was in the staff board.

p/s: Moderators, please don&#39;t lock this.</description>

He’s not proposing that we deny invitation to those who try, but rather deny those who post without thinking at all. There are a number of reasons why moparscape doesn’t progress in the RSPS development scene. One is that there is no guidance. So where do you suggest we apply that guidance if you don’t think that Rixxx’s proposal is valid…?</p>

              <p>I have no idea how this will work, the help section never seems to change as it consists of newly registered members who know very little about Moparscape, they should be forced to read stickies in that section before they can post.</p>
<p>The amount of topics which are solved in stickies in the help section is astounding, people just ignore them. I also agree on stricter moderation but not too strict. As for the solved mod, what a great idea, completely agree to that.</p>
<p>As new servers are released and time goes by more FAQ are needed, I think we need a sticky with newer FAQ which covers basic programming questions which are repeatedly asked about in that board.</p>
