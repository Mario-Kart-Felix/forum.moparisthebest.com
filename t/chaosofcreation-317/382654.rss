Source: [U][B]Ambtionz Forever[/B][/U]
Info: [U][B]317 PI [/B][/U]
[U][B]To have full pvp with all skills and economy [/B][/U]


[U][B]Combat[/B][/U] 
[U][B]Range[/B][/U]
I don&#39;t stress enough how close the max hit formula is. It has every single range item added. It has all correct strength and effects such as enchanted bolts which all work with correct gfx. All darts, javelins, axes, darts, knifes and arrows, also chinchompas.
You can gain any of the equipment either by making them, drops or shops.

[U][B]Magic[/B][/U]
Magic bonuses has been updated to a more real state. Combos have been fixed such as bow/mage to special attack, before you could stand from 2 squares away. Every single spell will work on all spellbooks modern, ancient and lunar(few exceptions).
The annoying c&#39;bow to mage bug and other bugs like that have been fixed.

[U][B]Melee[/B][/U]
The best part of combat is definitely melee. It has a new hit formula which evolves around RuneScapes. It has perfect switching and combos.

[U][B]Skills[/B][/U]
[U][B]Woodcutting[/B][/U]
Woodcutting is one of them skills which are considered complete. If you have a bronze axe and a dragon axe and also have the correct level, it will use the dragon axe. Getting logs depend on the axe you are using, your woodcutting level and the tree. Has stumps with different respawn times. Has a method to check if the tree still exists so player can continue woodcutting. Has a lot of trees added.

[U][B]Firemaking[/B][/U]
Firemaking is another complete skill I would think. Has the firemaking motion, turning back to the log, dropping log, creating a fire on it, making it burn(disappears), and moves. The firemaking is clipped but not full world map but the main cities.

[U][B]Fishing[/B][/U]
There are 126 different fish to catch. There are all type of fishing excluding lure. The fishing is laid in catherby and there are two fishing spots at the home area. The time depending on what fish you get depends on your fishing level and the fish you are fishing.
Also has barb tail fishing. We can say this is a full skill.

[U][B]Cooking[/B][/U]
All the fish you can fish you can cook. Cooking gloves give you a less chance of burning. The burning of a fish depends on your cooking level and the fish required cooking level. There&#39;s also a fix level to stop burning fish.

[U][B]Thieving[/B][/U]
You can thieve all the stalls that are home, from of them you gain money. Every npc that has an pickpocket option can be pick pocketed. The chance if succeeding a pickpocket depends on your thieving level and the required level. If fails player gets stunned and can&#39;t move. When you thieve stall the stall disappears and creates a empty one, the respawn times are 99% close to RuneScape(Source: RuneScape Wiki).

[U][B]Agility[/B][/U]
Full gnome agility with correct obstacles, also have wildy agility course but it isn&#39;t that great even tho everything works. Agility doesn&#39;t require no agility levels to complete an obstacle.

[U][B]Herb[/B][/U]
Yes, another complete skill is what I like to think. Has all cleaning herbs, making unfinished potions and making finished potions. Has emptying and mixing also

[U][B]Fletching[/B][/U]
Fletching is another complete skill. There&#39;s fletching all bows and shafts, making all darts also. The formula is perfect for working out to make 15 or less.
