    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-is-this-suppose-to-happen/37888</link>
    <description>i downloaded moparacape. i went into the c: directorie and then went to moparscape. it had other folders; Hybridscape, Music, All_ids, Aryan and then a files; moparscape.jar and had bat files; runmoparscape.bat and another one which is for linux. Well i started changing stuff and deleting NPC&#39;s and whatever i changed happend on the game...i didnt need to compile. when i downloaded testcape source (can&#39;t spell it) and started changing stuff on there and compiled it didnt work. one more thing, i can&#39;t do the tutorials because it aint got client.java in the Moparscape folder. Can anyone tell me why this is and what i should do please?
