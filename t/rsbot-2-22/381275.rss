    <description>While snooping around on Rune Serba I found this post.
IF YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED THIS VERSION OF RSBOT PLEASE SCAN YOU&#39;RE COMPUTER.
After seeing this post I scanned my computer and found over 9 different type&#39;s of virus.


&lt;blockquote&gt;This thread is to explain what exactly happened, how it happened and when. I see a lot of rumors going around of how it did, and I would like to set things straight. Also, to all of you saying &quot;GF NOOB REPORTED TO JAGEHX AND TEH POLEESE@!@!!!&quot; Do you really think Jagex would do shit to the ones who fucked up nearly every single botter in the game? lol. 

The hacks were all obtained through PowerBot.org, and were committed by myself and friends. PowerBot did not wan&#39;t to cause a panic among it&#39;s members so they make up some BS story about how &quot;Arbiter&quot; has released his scripts with a backdoor in them and had begun to hack PowerBot members (they saw my &quot;crew&quot; hacking all the members, and figured they can bounce all of the blame onto Arbiter so he could not be successful with his new bot).

I would like to clarify that ArbiBots, Nexus, and whatever other bots there are out there, are not the reason your accounts have been hacked, it is solely PowerBot. Secondly, do not think I am a l33t hax0r for this. I am not, and will not pretend to be. I simply found an exploit, and took advantage of it, also I coded the virus myself.

December 2010 - PowerBot&#39;s website is hacked, and the download link is changed to a version of &quot;RSBot-222.jar&quot; which downloaded and executed StealthBot v2.4 (Steals PowerBot information, NeXuS data.db files, ability to open websites on the slave computer, ability to download and execute programs, ability to spam IRC channels). I don&#39;t think the admins EVER caught onto this.

Through the following weeks, the IRC server became built up to the point where I started giving out random accounts to random people for free (I think I dumped nearly 2,500 accounts total across ********, FJForums, D0x, and Hacking.rs). 

January 23th, 2011 - Stealth-Network (The IRC Network, 4 servers) is shut down (DNS terminated). The bots all left, and never came back.

January 24th, 2011 - I wrote a quick program to go through EVERY single dump that each and every bot had stolen, and compile them into an easy to read
Code:
[Username : Password : Pin]
format. After which, the resulting file was nearly 630,000 lines long (I realized something was wrong) and revamped it to remove all duplicates, and failed password decrypts. The final file had nearly 14,000 accounts (13,918 lines exactly). I encrypted the file, locked it with a password, and uploaded to my site to send to a few of my good friends. We began logging each of the accounts until the return of free trade.

February 1st, 2011 - Free trade is out, my friends and I, (ALONG WITH EVERYONE WHO RECEIVED AND SAVED ACCOUNTS FROM THE DUMPS!) began hacking going down the list (only my friends and I have this list) at random sections throughout.

February 4th, 2011 - 581 accounts later, my own personal stash, is at about 6.43B.

One of my friends (Merch, who hacked about 600+ accounts) got his mule banned (GF 4.9B LOL!).

(This is not from my stash at all, I still have all 6.43B).

Some of you might be saying &quot;Lol, I use PowerBot and I have not been hacked noob!&quot; Well as this may be the case now, I think total, my friends and I have only covered 2000/14000 (14.2%) accounts of the list. Also, to everyone who has been hacked and is a member here, I am sorry, there really isn&#39;t much I myself can do, as it was a group effort, I can not simply take your word of &quot;I had phats and u haxed me, giff me back plzzzz&quot; and give you partyhats =/... let this be a lesson to you I guess =/ ..

The only way to save your account is to change your password (as StealthBot is no longer active, we will not get your new passwords). Also, let this be a lesson to you to not save your account information into a bot that is open source (such as PowerBot) because it is VERY easy to make a decryption snippet to add to a virus.

I WILL BE DOING THIS AGAIN TO POWERBOT IN THE FUTURE (WHEN THE NEW STEALTHBOT IS FINISHED!) SO IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR ACCOUNTS DELETE YOUR .INI FILE AND DO NOT SAVE YOUR INFO WITHIN IT.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

Also, if they had infected the actual download link, DDoSing the site would make them lose downloads, which is the opposite of what they would want to do. If just scripts were infected, the DDoSing the site (after everyone had the infected scripts) would be a good way to go because then no one could see the announcements about the scripts.</p>
