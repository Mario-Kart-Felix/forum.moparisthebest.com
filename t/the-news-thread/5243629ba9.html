[/quote]Just let it go.  Ruby did the right thing.  People have done this before (filling up the entire front page with threads) and they have been merged without question.  What makes this any different?[/quote]The fact that it’s news. You can’t have “A news thread” and expect people to read and discuss it. People read news based on the title, if they think it looks interesting they click and if not they ignore it. That paired with the fact that the different news articles aren’t on even remotely the same content means that there is no reason to merge them. It’s like merging all of the RSPS advertisements into one thread because they are all rsps advertisements</p>

<p>One of the threads was about an Egyptian photographer being killed. If another article was released that gave further information on the same topic, then it would be wrong for me to make another thread for the new article because they’re the <span class="bbcode-b">same topic</span>. However, the topics are completely unrelated and as you can see are impossible to discuss. Why do newspapers have headlines? Surely that’s just wasted space, they could just write “newspaper” on the front and let people read every article to find out if it’s interesting</p>

        <p>I guess the real question is why the topics were made. If they were just threads made right in a row with just a link and no discussion questions or anything I would see that as spam (which should be deleted, not merged). Afterall, this is a discussion section, not a breaking news website where you can just post a link and/or quote the article. Especially when they are so irrelevant.</p>

<p>[quote] AN Australian DJ whose hoax call was followed by the suicide of a royal nurse is taking legal action against her radio station over HER safety.</p>
<p>Blonde Mel Greig could be in line for a huge compensation payout should she win the legal bid - after she faced a barrage of hate across the globe over the sickening prank.</p>
<p>Greig, 30, made a bogus call to the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated during her pregnancy and learned about Kate’s condition from unsuspecting staff nurse Jacintha Saldanha, 46.</p>
<p>Now Greig is accusing her employer Southern Cross Austereo of failing to provide a safe workplace at 2Day FM radio station, the Melbourne Age has reported.</p>
<p>Nurse Jacintha was found dead three days after Ms Greig and her colleague Michael Christian called King Edward VII’s Hospital, where Kate was being treated for severe morning sickness, pretending to be the Queen and Prince Philip, in December.</p>
<p>Greig and Christian were then slammed on Twitter and social networking sites.</p>
<p>Ms Greig’s lawyer, Steven Lewis, of Slater &amp; Gordon, told Fairfax Media: “I can confirm that a general protections application has been filed with Fair Work Australia on behalf of Mel Greig against Southern Cross Austereo.”</p>
<p>The application alleges Southern Cross Austereo failed to maintain a safe workplace in relation to the hoax phone call incident.</p>
<p>Ms Greig has not returned to work since the incident but Mr Christian was controversially awarded the internal “Next Top Jock” competition for DJs at his employer which aimed to find the “best in the land”.</p>
<p>Ms Greig’s legal action comes as Southern Cross Austereo awaits a decision from the Federal Court about the authority of the broadcasting watchdog, the newspaper reported.[/quote][/quote][quote=“Ambokile, post:9, topic:524362”]<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/5006470/Chile-president-PRAISES-rape-victim-11-who-wants-to-keep-her-baby.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/5006470/Chile-president-PRAISES-rape-victim-11-who-wants-to-keep-her-baby.html</a></p>
<p>[quote] THE anti-abortion President of Chile has sparked fury after praising an 11-year-old girl set to have a rapist’s baby.</p>
<p>President Sebastian Pinera’s claimed the youngster had “depth and maturity” after she said wants to give birth to the baby conceived when she was attacked by her mother’s partner.</p>
<p>The comments caused anger on social media in a case that has ignited a heated national debate over abortion in one of Latin America’s most conservative nations.</p>
<p>Abortions - even for medical reasons and in the case of rape - are illegal in Chile.</p>
<p>The girl was repeatedly raped over the course of two years by her mother’s partner who has been arrested and has confessed to abusing the child.</p>
<p>Her mother shocked Chileans recently when she defended him saying his relationship was consensual.</p>
<p>The case was brought to police by the pregnant child’s maternal grandmother in the remote southern city of Puerto Montt.</p>
<p>The unidentified girl, whose face was obscured during a TV interview, said: "It will be like having a doll in my arms.</p>
<p>“I’m going to love the baby very much, even though it comes from that man who hurt me.”</p>
<p>Pinera said his government is concerned about protecting the girl’s health.</p>
<p>But experts say the girl’s life is at risk and that she is not prepared to take a decision about her pregnancy.</p>
<p>Giorgio Agostini, a forensic psychologist who has worked on dozens of child sex abuse cases, said: “At that age the girl doesn’t have a capacity of discernment, not even at age 14 would she have the mental and emotional capacity to discern this.”</p>
<p>Agostini continued: "It’s very likely that she is saying that she wants to have the baby like a living doll. We’ve seen this in other investigations.</p>
<p>“So what the president is saying doesn’t get close to the psychological truth of an 11-year-old-girl. It’s a subjective view that is not based on any scientific reasoning to support it.”</p>
<p>Former President Michelle Bachelet, the frontrunner in the November 17 presidential elections, favours legalising abortion in cases of rape or risks to the health of the pregnant woman or the child.</p>
<p>The paediatrician who spent the past several years heading the UN agency for women, also referred to the child’s case in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Bachelet said in a radio interview: “She’s a girl who needs to be protected and therefore I think a therapeutic abortion, in this case because of rape, would be in order.”[/quote][/quote][quote=“Ambokile, post:12, topic:524362”]<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/5005590/Three-women-escape-being-sex-slaves-and-speak-publically-about-ordeal.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/5005590/Three-women-escape-being-sex-slaves-and-speak-publically-about-ordeal.html</a></p>
<p>[quote] THREE women held hostage as sex slaves for more than a decade have spoken publicly for the first time about their ordeal.</p>
<p>Amanda Berry, 27, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus released a three-minute video thanking everyone for their support since escaping Ariel Castro two months ago.</p>
<p>Amanda — before her kidnap aged 16 — gave birth to a daughter fathered by rapist Castro in captivity.</p>
<p>She said: “It has been a blessing to have such an outpouring of love and kindness. I’m getting stronger each day.”</p>
<p>Michelle, 32, was repeatedly raped then starved and beaten until she miscarried during 11 years of captivity.</p>
<p>But she declared: “I am strong enough to walk through hell with a smile on my face and my head held high. I will not let the situations define who I am. I don’t want to be consumed by hatred.”</p>
<p>Gina, 23, who went missing in 2004 aged 14, thanked well-wishers. Castro, 52, grabbed them off the streets in Ohio, US. He was arrested after Amanda broke out of his home and screamed for help.</p>
<p>Castro denies 329 charges.[/quote]</p>

<p>[quote]A cafe owner has put up a sign warning customers who are ‘allergic to black people’ not to enter her business after becoming fed up with patrons walking out when they see the colour of her skin.</p>
<p>Martha-Renee Kolleh has placed the sign on the door of the Yeanon Cafe, in Ossett, West Yorkshire, which reads 'I am a black woman…If you are allergic to black people, don’t come in.</p>
<p>‘But, if you prefer quality wholesome meals in a pleasant and clean environment, come in. I don’t bite!’</p>
<p>The single mother-of-three said she put it there because of the way some customers have treated her.</p>
<p>She said: 'When they open the door, they see a black face. I put [the sign] there because of the way people treat me in Ossett.</p>
<p>'Some people find the sign amusing and they say “oh yes, it’s about time you put that up”, so I think they all realise what’s going on here.</p>
<p>‘Some others just read it and walk away. I’ve heard one or two swearwords as well regarding the notice.’</p>
<p>A spokesman for Wakefield Council said they were ‘obviously concerned’ by the issue, which they had not been made aware of before.</p>
<p>The spokesman added: ‘I would urge the business involved to get in touch with us as soon as possible.’</p>
<p>Ms Kolleh has run the cafe for two years, serving a mixture of British, African and Caribbean food.</p>
<p>She said a lot of people in Ossett had supported her, but if business did not improve she would have to close by autumn.</p>
<p>‘They just open the door of my cafe and once they take a look at me they walk out,’ she said. [/quote]</p>

        <p>Exactly what Jmood said.  I can understand starting a topic about a news topic, but creating 10 threads all about a different story is indeed spam, and something should be done about it.  Even if they were deleted we would still hear you bitch.  Just be glad they are still there and not in the trash.  If you want people to be informed about news just post a link to a news site in your signature.  No one wants to see a huge wall of threads about stories that were written somewhere else.</p>

<p>One of the threads was about an Egyptian photographer being killed. If another article was released that gave further information on the same topic, then it would be wrong for me to make another thread for the new article because they’re the <span class="bbcode-b">same topic</span>. However, the topics are completely unrelated and as you can see are impossible to discuss. Why do newspapers have headlines? Surely that’s just wasted space, they could just write “newspaper” on the front and let people read every article to find out if it’s interesting</p>

</aside>
<p>You are completely missing the point.  The Moparscape general discussion forum is not a newspaper.  If you want to make people read some 50 news posts so bad, don’t spam the forum, instead put them in the Mopar monthly.</p>
<p>I could totally understand you posting every single one of these threads.  However, space them apart so they don’t clog the entire page.  You say they need to be discussed separately, yet you post 10 articles are the same time, so they have less of a chance for them to be discussed.</p>
<p>Again, most of us could care less about the news, and for those who do, that’s why there are other websites.</p>

<p>I guess the real question is why the topics were made. If they were just threads made right in a row with just a link and no discussion questions or anything I would see that as spam (which should be deleted, not merged). Afterall, this is a discussion section, not a breaking news website where you can just post a link and/or quote the article. Especially when they are so irrelevant.</p>

</aside>
<p>I found them interesting and it’s interesting to discuss world issues. However the level of discussion wouldn’t be as high as a post focused solely on discussing a topic (such as a debate) which is why they belonged here rather than the Intelligent Discussions and Debates section.<br>
[/quote]that’s still a lot of topics for 1 day with no extra thought put into them except a quote and a link<br>
[/quote]Which was exactly our reasoning for merging them. If you don’t like how it’s handled then don’t spam the board with links that 9/10 people won’t be interested in. If you feel the need to post every link pertaining to a story in the paper go post it in the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,134.0.html" data-bbcode="true">Moparisthebest.com news board</a>. Although when you spam that you’ll get a much harsher reply than you would’ve here.[/quote]should have just been deleted tbh, having them in one thread is just as worthless</p>
