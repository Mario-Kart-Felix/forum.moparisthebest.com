    <title>Anyone know how to integrate hiscores to a forumotion forum board</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-know-how-to-integrate-hiscores-to-a-forumotion-forum-board/310798</link>
    <description>I run a delta 317 rsps.  For a website, I use forumotion which if I could go back, I would, but since I already did it...  Anyways I run the rsps from my pc at home and want to know if anyone knows if there is a way to do this.

Thanks</description>

              <p>I once made a script for someone a year or two ago that had a php socket server on the rsps side and a client at the forum side, when the client sent a request to the rsps php socket server, the php socket server read the player files, and sent the names and high scores to the forum side client. The forum side client then made a db and set all the names and high scores into it.</p>
<p>If you wanted, you could make the script also send passwords and shit so it just makes the user an account on the forum, and when they log into the forum for the first time then they have to set their email.</p>
<p>But you would want at least a host which allows uploading php and making mysql databases.</p>

              <p>Your best bet would probably be to edit the server to save all the data to a mysql db and then read the db with a php script.</p>
