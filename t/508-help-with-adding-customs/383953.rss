    <title>[508] Help with adding customs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-help-with-adding-customs/383953</link>
    <description>[size=12pt][font=courier]I&#39;m trying to find out how to add models, gfx&#39;s, emote&#39;s to my 508 server (such as chaotic maul and other newer runescape items) and i have absolutely no clue where to start. I tried looking up tutorials but they seem to be out of date or just not what i&#39;m looking for. If someone could give me some links or tutorials or just help me through an easy example that would be greatly appreciated. thanks :)[/font][/size]</description>
