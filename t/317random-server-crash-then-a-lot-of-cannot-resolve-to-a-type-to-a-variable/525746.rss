    <description>This is a 317 Project Insanity server from Acheron(or so it was named). I&#39;m pretty sure nothing was wrong at first, because I started the server and it ran fine for a minute, but I clicked something in game I think and it crashed the server, when i started it, the cmd prompt was just rapidly closing and opening with an error.(in the pic)I went to where it said the problem was, and it looks fine to me, but I&#39;m not an expert, so any help would be appreciated! There is an error out of no where when I compile too, but it doesn&#39;t make sense to me.

<p>It’s a Project Insanity, I mentioned it at the top. If there’s more I should tell you, tell me. It was originally called Acheron, though.</p>
