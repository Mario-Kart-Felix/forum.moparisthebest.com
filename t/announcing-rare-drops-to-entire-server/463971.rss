    <description>Yes, Yes, i know i&#39;ve seen a few threads, but people don&#39;t seem to be giving any information that i don&#39;t really have, im curious if anyone may know a snippet or a guide on how to, as i&#39;m still learning to code, i understand most of what i&#39;m suppose to do but still not quite figuring it out.

Thanks for any replies.</description>

<p>Your definition of answer is equal to leeching. You want somebody to give you the code, you can’t figure it out by yourself.</p>
<p>OT: There is a block in the drop method for rare drops, inside of that block insert a code that iterates over all the players in the server, and then sends a message to all of them, as for what the method says, grab the id of the rare drop id from the collection, then using a method found somewhere in your API, get the name for that item.</p>

              <p>I’m not exactly looking for a spoon fed answer, just a simple tutorial or guide even, it doesn’t have to be fully copy and paste i’m just unsure if theres a certain line of code for the drops or not, i know it has something to do with a rare drop ID coming from the npc but that’s about it…</p>
