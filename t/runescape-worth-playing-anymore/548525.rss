    <title>RuneScape Worth Playing Anymore?</title>

    <description>Is RuneScape worth playing anymore?

I&#39;m thinking about buying a membership, but how the game takes up a lot of time to do something worthwhile makes rethink playing again. I really did enjoy the game; it was a nice time killer to play with friends. The community looks to be a whole new generation now! A lot of the prices seem different now (Amardyl armor set is now 15M? I remember when it was like 100M!) Playing again would mean starting from almost nothing because I gave away a lot of my stuff before I quit. However, it probably wouldn&#39;t take as long now compared to years ago to get a few millions.

Basically, I&#39;m on the fence on whether to play again or not. I&#39;m really considering EoC over RS2007 :P

Edit: Another thing that is bugging me how Jagex is gravitating towards a micropayment system. A lot of the gameplay looks like pop-up ads which really clutters the screen.

Do any of you still play, and how do you like it?</description>

              <p>[quote=“2Hdagger, post:5, topic:548525”]If you like playing a game that:<br>
Shoves microtransactions in everyone’s faces including paying members<br>
Doesn’t fix year-old game-breaking bugs<br>
Is pay-to-win<br>
Isn’t getting many new players<br>
Has a bad community</p>
<p>I’d rather just play an rsps alone.[/quote]<br>
The micro-transactions aren’t shoved in your face. The only time you see something about them in-game, is in the game lobby, and a little banner at the bottom of the treasure hunter interface. Other than that, they’re mainly on the RS site.</p>
<p>There are bugs, of course there will be bugs. Every game has bugs. But they aren’t year old bugs.</p>
<p>RuneScape averages around 60-65k players per day (70k+ on weekends and holidays), which compared the numbers after the release of EoC, is much better. Of course, you can’t really compare those numbers to the numbers a few years back. Every game dies down in players after a certain amount of time. It is a 13 year old game after all.</p>
<p>The community is actually pretty good. You will run into some assholes that just don’t care about anything except themselves, but people like that are everywhere.</p>
<p>To me, you just seem like a person that hates RS in general, which there’s nothing wrong with that. But you really don’t need to say stuff that isn’t true. The pay-to-win part is really the only true thing you said.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Soulcist, post:15, topic:548525”]I think R-S is most useful for its experience in exploring if above anything such as the quests, learning some interesting trust as how Jagex has taken the fantasy world, interesting graphics in their own right and so on. I’m not sure if it’s all hands die, die hard, crazy to go on about but I suppose it’s a time killer - that’s about it and all I have. I have to agree with Elrick on his points above though, you do have to spend a lot of money to get some advancement in your character. I don’t even know where the Hell to start on how making money or anything.</p>
<p>I don’t even think using a gold site would be worth the time IMO.[/quote]<br>
Nope, ever since bonds were released Jagex really killed the RWT scene, which is why most bot companies have moved on. Between Jagex’s past/most recent battle against the bots with the lawsuits, the newer detection systems they put in place, and bonds, you don’t see them much besides a few at blue dragons and frosts.</p>
<p>The reason the game is fun for me is because I don’t fill into that greed garbage most people have been doing and try to accumulate millions of gp through illegitimate means. I get mine through PvM and skills, and honestly the economy has become much more balanced through out all the levels in a skill like Herblore, and even a bit of prayer. I guess it’s just based on what you like to do in Runescape… I like the adventuring, slaying demons and shit, grinding out a few levels and then trying to see what I can do in another skill. If you want to gain Party Hats and do gambling and shit, RS isn’t the game to do that on anymore.</p>
<p>Overall the gameplay aspect of cost and time is much more reasonable. It gets a tad ridiculous when you want to start saving up for Party hats and crap. But even the tier 90 weapons are somewhat reasonably priced. Aside from range, fuck range.</p>

-It really doesn’t shove them in your face. It makes it known that when you use the keys that you can buy more, but there aren’t that many reminders.</p>
<p>-I don’t know that many game-breaking bugs as of yet. In fact the game is much more playable than it was right after eoc.</p>
<p>-I used to be very much like you and think that the game was pay to win, but it’s really not. In order to make any significant change in your character you would need to spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars; OR get really lucky multiple times.</p>

Shoves microtransactions in everyone’s faces including paying members<br>
Doesn’t fix year-old game-breaking bugs<br>
Is pay-to-win<br>
Isn’t getting many new players<br>
Has a bad community</p>
<p>I’d rather just play an rsps alone.</p>

<p>Sorry, but where do you see pop-up ads? If you’re talking about the ad on the client, it’s just one ad at the top of the window, but it doesn’t clutter the screen.</p>
<p>But, if you enjoy playing the game, why not? I still enjoy playing it.</p>

              <p>Is RuneScape worth playing anymore?</p>
<p>I’m thinking about buying a membership, but how the game takes up a lot of time to do something worthwhile makes rethink playing again. I really did enjoy the game; it was a nice time killer to play with friends. The community looks to be a whole new generation now! A lot of the prices seem different now (Amardyl armor set is now 15M? I remember when it was like 100M!) Playing again would mean starting from almost nothing because I gave away a lot of my stuff before I quit. However, it probably wouldn’t take as long now compared to years ago to get a few millions.</p>
<p>Basically, I’m on the fence on whether to play again or not. I’m really considering EoC over RS2007 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Edit: Another thing that is bugging me how Jagex is gravitating towards a micropayment system. A lot of the gameplay looks like pop-up ads which really clutters the screen.</p>
<p>Do any of you still play, and how do you like it?</p>
