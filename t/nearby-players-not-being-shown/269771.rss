    <description>So, the problem:
I&#39;m making a fun PK area, in the middle of the Mage Arena, and when you teleport there you&#39;re occasionally unable to see players that are already there; or that come in after you. They can sometimes see you, and attack you, but you&#39;re unable to see them.

Is there a method to call to fix this (after the teleport, maybe?), or does anybody know what the problem is?</description>
