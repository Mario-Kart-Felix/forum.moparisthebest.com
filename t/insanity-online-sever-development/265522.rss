These are the current positions you can apply for;

If one of the admins decide you have to go and have a good explanatory reason they must forward it on to me first and get acceptance. You will be then told the reason why and demoted ASAP.[/i][/font]

Your ‘positive attitude’ as reaper says is great, but you need some common sense to go with it.</p>
