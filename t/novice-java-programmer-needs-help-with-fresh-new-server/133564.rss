    <title>Novice Java Programmer Needs Help with Fresh New Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/novice-java-programmer-needs-help-with-fresh-new-server/133564</link>
    <description>Hello, I am new and just finished the forum quiz on the first try. I&#39;m pretty experienced with C++ and a bit with Java. I downloaded Moparscape w/  Aryan and have started my own server under the IP, khunter9scape.servegame.com    ...People are able to connect to and play on my server freely, but my server is somewhat &quot;dull&quot;. Nothing special compared to most other servers. I would like to personalize my server with various shops and guards and Welcome screen. I have no idea how to do those things. I only know how to spawn npc&#39;s and item&#39;s. Can someone walk me through the steps?</description>
