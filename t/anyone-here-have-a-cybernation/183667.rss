    <title>Anyone here have a cybernation?</title>

    <description>Its sorta like erepublik...only instead of being a single citizen you run your own nation :D
Its also a daily kinda game like erepublik and is browser based.

You pretty much get to choose everything about your nation at the beginning. What is your nation&#39;s ethnic group, religion, government, tax rate, currency, etc. Then after setting all that your given two resources that you have an unlimited amount of. For example...

my starting resources were coal and pigs..sounds pretty dumb but I looked at their effects...

&quot;coal- increases the purchased land area of a nation by 15%, increases soldier efficiency by 8%, and decreases infrastructure cost -4%&quot;
&quot;pigs- Lowers solider upkeep cost -.50, increases solider efficiency by 15%, and increases population by 3.5%&quot;

Now I&#39;m thinking: &quot;awesome! I got coal and pigs!&quot; :D

Also turns out that you can trade with other nations for their resources, and you keep the first 2 resources..so I guess its more of a lending then trading..

You can also get a certain combo of resources and unlock certain bonuses. Example If I obtained iron through trade from another nation, I would unlock steel, because then I would have iron and coal. Steel would also reduce my infrastructure cost by -2%. [url=http://www.cybernations.net/about_topics.asp#Resources_&amp;_Trades]heres a list[/url]

Every good nation needs a military right? Because you can fight with other nations. Well you also have complete control over this. You can pick and choose the following:

(Remember I made my nation today so my military sucks :P)

I wouldn&#39;t recommend messing with the DEFCON level either it effects your economy when higher (obviously) and then you rack in less money daily from taxes. I was just messing around, but now I have to wait till tomorrow to change it..

...and heres my population info.

Notice how my people are unhappy with me..this is mostly cuz of my DEFCON level...they were happy till I changed it...also notice the cramped population lol..


Here you can see my resources and some other random info

One final thing that I thought was cool is how you can watch your nation grow map wise. At the beginning you can select where you nation starts on the world map, and then as you buy more land you can watch the ring around the center of the nation grow.

My nation so far...not even a mile of land owned so far :P
