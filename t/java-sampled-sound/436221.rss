    <title>Java Sampled Sound</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-sampled-sound/436221</link>
    <description>I have an assignment for uni where I have to create effects to a recorded piece of sound. Atm, the applet records the sound, and then adds an echo effect to it when the button is clicked. What I now have to do is add two more methods, one that will change the balance of the sound over time, so the sound moves from the one channel to the other and back. The method takes parameter: durationInMilliseconds. 

Here is a note from my lecturer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To keep this method simpler samples will not exceed their original value. At the start of an interval the samples on channel 0 are on 100% of the original value and the samples on channel 1 are on 0%. These percentages changes to 50% (channel 0) and 50% (channel 1) at a quarter of the interval, to 0% (channel 0) and 100% (channel 1) at half of the interval and again to 50% (channel 0) and 50% (channel 1) at three quarters of the interval, and back to start.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I went to the &#39;Dam and missed the lecture on this, and I&#39;m struggling to find any help on google. 

So far I have converted the audio in to a ByteArray, but I really don&#39;t have much of an idea on what to do with the byte array to turn it in to the desired effect. I&#39;m messing around with it, but not really getting anywhere, so any help would be appreciated!

EDIT - So really what I need to do is understand how to change the channel the audio is being sent to every 25% of the sound clip?</description>

<p>Besides that, is ‘homeworks’ used correctly? To me, the meaning of homework changes when you make it plural.</p>

Haha, it’s quite interesting, and the lecturers really good, but that doesn’t help when you dont go!!</p>
<p>I’m gutted man, everyone on the coach was saying don’t do it, you’ll get caught, so I pussied out. Turns out I could of had a ruksack full of weed and it wouldn’t of been found. No security scans, or body checks. Just showed my passport and got on the ferry.<br>
