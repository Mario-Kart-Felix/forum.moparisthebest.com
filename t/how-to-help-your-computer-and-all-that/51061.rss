                                              INTRODUCTION

Ok,first,sorry for posting in all capitals.But I need this to get read.

So anyways,this is about how to prevent and fix lag and stuff on your server.Like an FAQ.
====================================================================================

                                        MY SERVER WONT CONNECT

Q- My server wont work,it goes to hybridscape instead of the server I wana go on/mine.

A-You have to make sure everything is connected.Like run-server is one,everything is compiled,there are no viruses on your computer.All that stuff.Another thing that may cause this is too much memory,too much memory=major lag=server crash=possible comp crash.

Also,A biggy is if it&#39;s on hamachi make sure you joined the network and it is FULLY LOADED.
Another hamachi thing is that if it&#39;s still not working and everything is on,go to my computer&gt;my network connections and make sure hamachi networks are on,repair it incase too.

By the way DONT EVER TURN OFF LOCAL AREA CONNECTIONS-THIS STOPS YOU FROM ACSESSING THE INTERNET! I TRIED IT.SO DON&#39;T DISABLE LOCAL AREA CONNECTIONS.
=====================================================================================
                                       
                                            VIRUSES AND CURES

Q-I have a virus,what should I do.

A-Delete it,update all fire walls,go to a help site-whatever you can.Change all passwords and all that but make em memorable.ESPECIALLY YOUR REAL LIFE BANK NUMBER/PASSWORD.THEY CAN GET INTO YOUR BANK AND STEAL $1000,000.

===================================================================================

                                        WHY YOU CANT ACSESS YOU INTERNET.

Q-I can&#39;t accsess my internet-WTF.

A-Make sure your ISP ( Internet Service Provider ) has enabled acsess to sites.Make sure you&#39;r local area connections are ON.Make all sites availible ( except porn and that stuff._) Then  make sure is something is plugged in isn&#39;t supposed to be there,remove it.This could also be a result of too much memory!

===================================================================================

                                                BLACK ORIFICE-WHY YOU&#39;R COMP CANT LOAD ETC

Q- My computer keeps blacking out and crashing.WHATS UP!?!!

A-In this situation,say the following 5 times &quot; oh shit,i have black orifice,a trojan horse.&quot;
Black orifice can destroy you&#39;r computer.It can be scanned,it is often a kaylogger.
It can literally destroy the computers data,and fuck it up.Remove it ASAP.Since it causes black outs,you may not have enough time to remove it before the comp blacks out and you&#39;ll have to re-start removing it.Oh wait,I forgot to mention-when it blacks it oftenly means It&#39;s killed the computer.No cure.
You&#39;ll oftently need another computer.
Better get some money. ( I had it once,luckily I had like 5 minutes time to remove it before it blacked out.It was overheating too.whew!!!Black orifice can be mistaken for alot of things.
===================================================================================

                                                  MISCELLANIOUS

Q-It&#39;s not anything,my comp just can do anything.

A-your comp is too old,the ISP guy quit,too much memory,loaded with viruses,someone damadged it,it wasn&#39;t manufactured well.

LOTS OF POSSIBILILITYS.PICK ONE AND SOLVE IT YOURSELF.I AIN&#39;T WASTING 100 HOURS OF MY LIFE LISTING THE STUFF FOR YOU.LMAO!!
==================================================================================


                                            [u] MAKING MODS/ADMINS [/u]

This is very easy.

Close everything and re-start you&#39;r computer.

Then,open you&#39;r server source,and go to characters to the profiles.
You should see &quot;character rights = 3&quot; somewhere if they are owner.
You should see &quot;character rights = 2&quot; somewhere if they are admin.
You should see character rights= 1&quot; somewhere if they are a moderator

You should see character rights= 0 if they are a normal player.

Just do this.

Change all the people you don&#39;t want to be mod/admin-make thier character rights to 0.

If you want someone to be mod-make it character rights = 1
If you want someone to be admin make character rights = 2
If you want someone to be co-owner make char rights = 3

Normal player is char rights 0.

Hope this helped.
==================================================================================
                                          CONCLUSION

I hope you found a &quot;cure&quot; for your computer,or a way to help you&#39;r server by using this guide.Or even maybe rescueing your computer from a disaster Sad) Smiley

<pre><code>                                          INTRODUCTION
</code></pre>
<p>Ok,first,sorry for posting in all capitals.But I need this to get read.</p>
<h1>So anyways,this is about how to prevent and fix lag and stuff on your server.Like an FAQ.</h1>
<pre><code>                                    MY SERVER WONT CONNECT
</code></pre>
<p>Q- My server wont work,it goes to hybridscape instead of the server I wana go on/mine.</p>
<p>A-You have to make sure everything is connected.Like run-server is one,everything is compiled,there are no viruses on your computer.All that stuff.Another thing that may cause this is too much memory,too much memory=major lag=server crash=possible comp crash.</p>
<p>Also,A biggy is if it’s on hamachi make sure you joined the network and it is FULLY LOADED.<br>
Another hamachi thing is that if it’s still not working and everything is on,go to my computer&gt;my network connections and make sure hamachi networks are on,repair it incase too.</p>
<h1>By the way DONT EVER TURN OFF LOCAL AREA CONNECTIONS-THIS STOPS YOU FROM ACSESSING THE INTERNET! I TRIED IT.SO DON’T DISABLE LOCAL AREA CONNECTIONS.</h1>
<pre><code>                                        VIRUSES AND CURES
</code></pre>
<p>Q-I have a virus,what should I do.</p>
<p>A-Delete it,update all fire walls,go to a help site-whatever you can.Change all passwords and all that but make em memorable.ESPECIALLY YOUR REAL LIFE BANK NUMBER/PASSWORD.THEY CAN GET INTO YOUR BANK AND STEAL $1000,000.</p>
<p>===================================================================================</p>
<pre><code>                                    WHY YOU CANT ACSESS YOU INTERNET.
</code></pre>
<p>Q-I can’t accsess my internet-WTF.</p>
<p>A-Make sure your ISP ( Internet Service Provider ) has enabled acsess to sites.Make sure you’r local area connections are ON.Make all sites availible ( except porn and that stuff._) Then  make sure is something is plugged in isn’t supposed to be there,remove it.This could also be a result of too much memory!</p>
<p>===================================================================================</p>
<pre><code>                                            BLACK ORIFICE-WHY YOU'R COMP CANT LOAD ETC
</code></pre>
<p>Q- My computer keeps blacking out and crashing.WHATS UP!?!!</p>
<h1>A-In this situation,say the following 5 times " oh shit,i have black orifice,a trojan horse."<br>
Black orifice can destroy you’r computer.It can be scanned,it is often a kaylogger.<br>
It can literally destroy the computers data,and fuck it up.Remove it ASAP.Since it causes black outs,you may not have enough time to remove it before the comp blacks out and you’ll have to re-start removing it.Oh wait,I forgot to mention-when it blacks it oftenly means It’s killed the computer.No cure.<br>
You’ll oftently need another computer.<br>
Better get some money. ( I had it once,luckily I had like 5 minutes time to remove it before it blacked out.It was overheating too.whew!!!Black orifice can be mistaken for alot of things.</h1>
<pre><code>                                              MISCELLANIOUS
</code></pre>
<p>Q-It’s not anything,my comp just can do anything.</p>
<p>A-your comp is too old,the ISP guy quit,too much memory,loaded with viruses,someone damadged it,it wasn’t manufactured well.</p>
<h1>LOTS OF POSSIBILILITYS.PICK ONE AND SOLVE IT YOURSELF.I AIN’T WASTING 100 HOURS OF MY LIFE LISTING THE STUFF FOR YOU.LMAO!!</h1>
<pre><code>                                        [u] MAKING MODS/ADMINS [/u]
</code></pre>
<p>This is very easy.</p>
<p>Close everything and re-start you’r computer.</p>
<p>Then,open you’r server source,and go to characters to the profiles.<br>
You should see “character rights = 3” somewhere if they are owner.<br>
You should see “character rights = 2” somewhere if they are admin.<br>
You should see character rights= 1" somewhere if they are a moderator</p>
<p>You should see character rights= 0 if they are a normal player.</p>
<p>Just do this.</p>
<p>Change all the people you don’t want to be mod/admin-make thier character rights to 0.</p>
<p>If you want someone to be mod-make it character rights = 1<br>
If you want someone to be admin make character rights = 2<br>
If you want someone to be co-owner make char rights = 3</p>
<p>Normal player is char rights 0.</p>
<h1>Hope this helped.</h1>
