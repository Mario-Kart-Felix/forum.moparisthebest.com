    <description>Hey everyone,

My name is Devan, I used to be a big Runescape player when I was little and slowly lost interest in the actual game and fell in love with private servers. I have experienced with making private servers before and i can run sources and people can connect and all... but...
I&#39;m not too good with coding and all... I can do some stuff like add commands and place npcs and items... but a lot of the coding I don&#39;t understand. Plus I wanna get serious and start a serious server but I want a good source to start with and maybe someone to help code for with me... it&#39;s a fun thing nothing serious. If I can possibly have some help with this or become part of a development team on a server to learn some more stuff, I would appreciate it. ([b]Sorry if I put this in the wrong area, like i said i&#39;m new to this. If it&#39;s in wrong area just let me know where I can possibly put it.[/b])

[b]I would really appreciate any help.[/b]

Please and thanks,
Devan Williams.</description>

<p>Encouraging others to break rules is not a smart idea.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span><br>
I suggest reading about Java on the ‘official’ website. (If thats what you wanna call it).<br>
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html</a></p>
<p>Try also looking through the ‘general programming’ section. And possibly the ‘server tutorial’ section. (There are some good tutorials).</p>
