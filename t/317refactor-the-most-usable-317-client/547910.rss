    <title>317refactor - the most usable 317 client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317refactor-the-most-usable-317-client/547910</link>
    <description>[size=24pt][b]317refactor[/b][/size]
[size=16pt][b]An educational renaming of the #317 client[/b][/size]

This has been a project of mine for almost the last year. I have always had a passion for client development - it is a lot more fun to play with than server development, in my opinion. However, whilst developing this, I have been unable to add any features or modifications to the client and therefore the time has come where I must release this to the public and allow others to continue the project. Many sources have been used for the refactoring however besides the audio classes (which were refactored by veer) this is almost all my own work. 

[size=16pt][b][u]Why?[/u][/b][/size]
There is nothing more prohibitive to client development that many tutorials, snippets and tools are unsuitable for the large number of clients due to the deobfuscation process. All your client needs is a slightly different naming scheme to the author&#39;s and the guide is no longer applicable. There is little use in switching to a typical &quot;refactored&quot; client because the majority of these also lack a lot of renaming and therefore are not useful - whilst method names may be refactored suitably, the variable names may differ along with the method signatures and class names.

To combat this, and aid client development, I have refactored the near-majority of the code in the #317 client. This will, hopefully, give client developers a good base to work from and encourage users to share snippets and tutorials as they will actually be used by a lot of people.

[size=16pt][b][u]What have I done?[/u][/b][/size]
The code throughout the client has been refactored. Every class has a suitable name (even the less used ones, such as [b]GameObjectSpawnRequest[/b] or [b]WallDecoration[/b]. Almost every method has a suitable name along with having the arguments in a suitable order ([player, x, y, z] rather than [x, player, z, y]). The majority of global and local variables have been renamed to allow their meaning to be understood. Methods and variables within classes have been sorted in alphabetical order.

[size=16pt][b][u]Where can I get it?[/u][/b][/size]
You can find the project at [url=https://github.com/Jameskmonger/317refactor/]Jameskmonger/317refactor on GitHub[/url]. If you do not have Git, or do not wish to use it, you can simply [url=https://github.com/Jameskmonger/317refactor/archive/master.zip]download the project as a zip archive.[/url]

[size=16pt][b][u]How can I contribute?[/u][/b][/size]
If you wish to contribute to the codebase directly, the best way would be to fork the [url=https://github.com/Jameskmonger/317refactor/]GitHub repository[/url], make your changes, and then submit a pull request. If you do not wish to do this, you are welcome to send me a forum PM detailing your changes and I will submit them to the repository.

However, the way I would prefer people to contribute to this would be by using it for their own personal projects - whether they be private or public. I created it with the intent of allowing people further understanding of the client and so I&#39;d like to see that! :)

[size=10pt][b][u]Credits[/u][/b][/size]
Jagex - the client
Ambokile - majority of the renaming
veer - the sound system

<p>if u’ve actually looked at it (and are actually familiar with the client) you will see most of it is total nonsense (and I’m not even including the opengl stuff they tried to throw on)</p>

um not sure what you are talking about but between all the refactors out their you can put together a full refactored client. The biggest problem with 317 is that we do not have a completed cache anywhere due to the cache that is most commonly used didn’t wait for the ondemand fetcher to finish.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:60, topic:547910”]The original refactor is good.

<p>Two steps to do so:</p>

<li>Create the feature toggle class.</li>

<p>It means people can go through with an IDE to remove the feature easily if they just want the vanilla version of your refactored client.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for that. I wasn’t entirely sure whether or not I’d be committing the features but if I do I’ll follow the method above.</p>

<p>The snowing looks pretty cool, and I like the melting effect. It adds some nice detail. Obviously you’ll have a hard time eliminating the 3D camera/2D graphics problem unless you place the snowballs in the game world, so don’t worry about it. If you’re having jittery issues, try picking a slope and just moving along it for a short duration or the entire fall, or maybe using some sort of bezier curves for more interesting (although maybe slightly unrealistic) falling patterns.[/quote]</p>

<p>[quote=“2Hdagger, post:50, topic:547910”]Downloaded 7 servers and can only log in to 1 (The best Rsps To download V1 (317 PI)(Rswebclients compattible))</p>
<p>Had to remove the crash packet first<br>
Then the client would print the T2 error many times. My character was invisible nor could I move<br>
If I comment out the line that sets the interface text (packet 126), I can move my character but they’re still invisible</p>
<p>Ambokile could you please upload your server and cache somewhere (not mega it doesn’t work for me) :D[/quote]</p>
<p>I forgot to mention - as this client lacks a lot of the modifications made to common modern clients (interfaces, items, etc), it will crash if you try to give the player a new item or show a new interface.</p>
<p>This cache and server work perfectly for me:<br>

<p>Making the snow move as the camera moves shouldn’t be all thaaaaat difficult. In fact, it seems like a fun little challenge.</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure <span class="bbcode-b">how</span> it should move with the camera. (I know how to do it, but not sure how it should work).</p>
