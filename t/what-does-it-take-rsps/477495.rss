How are the servers with all these players getting ALL THESE PLAYERS? Are they having to fork out money left and right or are the owners popular? I am just curious, as to what makes a server succesful.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It takes a lot, here are a quick few things I can think of.</p>
<ul>
<li>A good development team (not one person doing all of the work.)</li>
<li>Good development team communication (this is key in success.)</li>
<li>A base money budget to be used for a good VPS.</li>
<li>A VPS that is rich in specs to support the server.</li>
<li>Staff not being given out to random people, actually making people work for it.</li>
<li>Gameplay, skills, pking, etc.</li>
<li>How well the staff team can solve player problems.</li>
<li>Cannot have owners who, ‘tlk lik disx’ …</li>
</ul>
<p>Some may be more/less true, but those are some of the main things, from my perspective. It’s all about community and staff team work, and making sure the players are happy. Also, on opening day, advertise A LOT. And possibly offer players a small reward for each friend they bring.[/quote]</p>
<p>Everything stated here is correct as well.</p>

Advertising and Search Engines. Also, successful can be defined in many varying degrees of success in the world of R.S.P.S.<br>

When I played inception I noticed they had no less than 150 players at a time and a bunch of people running around with items you only get from donating. they had vbulliten and had the normal “vote” page as everyone else so they were being advertised on the 5 or so rsps advertisers.[/quote]</p>
<p>Once a Server reaches a certain degree of ‘success’, the chidren with access to their parent’s credit cards (you would also be surprised at how many adults do this as well), will come piling out of the woodwork, simply because It’s a popular Server and they know they can pay2win. They (Founders) can then use that donation money to buy all forms of Advertising and optimization. Half of the ‘Coders’ (Programmers) the population believes to be Programmers don’t actually do anything special. They hire R.S.P.S. veterans and people who have a firm understanding on the structure and design (how everything works hand-in-hand and communicates). Once you understand structure and design - R.S.P.S. becomes a different ballgame.</p>
