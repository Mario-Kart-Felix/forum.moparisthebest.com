    <title>Shop value?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shop-value/322852</link>
    <description>I am running Bulby 508 Source. I went and added shops and you can buy from them and it takes the money it costs, but when i hit &quot;value&quot; nothing shows up. How do i make it so when you click on the item or click on value it says &quot;This item currently costs ####&quot;

replace numbers with cost of item</description>
