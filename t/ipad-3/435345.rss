    <title>iPad 3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ipad-3/435345</link>
    <description>Well I haven&#39;t seen any other topics and the release date looks to be only a day away so who is going to be getting one of these?

If all the rumours are true, hi resolution display, improved camera, quad core processor, etc... I will be buying one asap. Its to bad ASUS wasnt smart enough to release their android transformer prime hd at the same time because I definitely would have choosen that over the apple counterpart but it looks like they are forcing my hand on this one.

Thoughts on the iPad 3?</description>

<p>I’m not going to pay for an expensive app anyway unless I REALLY need it, IE I can get adobe cs5.5 for free but I would never buy it, I would just use gimp or another alternative, so there never going to get my money anyway. Anyways I’m not going to sit here and have a discussion on downloading paid apps for free, If paying for some and not paying for some makes you think of me as scum I’m probably not going to lose too much sleep.</p>

<p>“don’t really want to pay for apps” You didn’t narrow it down to the expensive ones, the few that there are. Most of them are below $5. Doesn’t make it any better though, still scum. Your excuses don’t matter, you’re still taking something you do not have the right to take - using something you have not paid for, which you should be. You’re leaving the developers out of pocket, regardless or not if you were going to buy it anyway, it doesn’t matter - it’s pretty simple.</p>

<p>Fuck off, tying to talk ethics like you have never EVER pirated a movie or downloaded a song illegally, im completely fine with paying $0.99 or even a couple dollars for an app but I’m not going to drop $400 dollars on 10 apps that have no refund policy, and amplitude with their irig worked like shit tonight so now I’m out 20 for that app.</p>

when you tlak to them, they’ve got like a set list of what they can do, so mostly what you say is irrelevant you just say its broken then they figure out what catergory it falls under to dtermine what they do</p>

              <p>Some people weirdly like that horrific experience of being at an Apple store. Worst places in the entire world, which is a shame, because having a place you can easily take your hardware to for a replacement or repair is good and has proved useful for me. It’s just stupidly overcrowded with dickheads checking facebook on the macs, and the “genius” bar being full of patronising twats.</p>
<p>Also, it is the hardest place in the world to actually buy something. You have to just hang around and look confused to get someone to take notice of you and take your order, then you still just hang around, because they thought actually having an area where you line up and pay for your shit would be too convenient for Apple.</p>

I can confirm the face recognition recognises black people.</p>

<p>No its pathetic especially when they are so stupid that they don’t realize that they could have bought their iPads at midnight from any 24-hour Walmart, or they are such fanboys that they will ONLY buy their apple products from apple, but yeah drove by at 5am and was about 20-40 people, anyways mine is coming via ups today so I don’t have to deal with with the retards. Would be fun to just take my ipad when I get it and go to the massive line and be a dick.</p>

<p>Im pretty excited for friday. Microsoft Office will be coming to the iPad soon so this will make this the perfect table for me to use at school and I just bought an iRig to use with my guitar and a jot pro for note taking and now I am waiting to see what case/keyboard combo I should get.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2012/02/022112-tech-apps-office-ss.jpg" alt><br>
[/quote]Keep in mind that the sound quality on iRig will be pretty shite. I have a StealthPlug from IK Multimedia, and it’s pretty much the same story. While it’s great if you’re moving about a lot, for serious recording it’s not worthwhile.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah I was looking at the reviews and I saw people where having problem with noise but it looks that can be fixed through changing some program options. I mainly just got it to play with since it was only ~25USD so I figured couldn’t go to wrong with it. If I get serious about it I will probably order an Apogee JAM in a couple months. Any other iPad accessories you guy recommend?[/quote]I’m picking up one of these soon <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/guitar/guitar-rig-kontrol/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/guitar/guitar-rig-kontrol/</a></p>
