    <title>[SQL] SQL Injection</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sql-sql-injection/9083</link>
    <description>Basically, this is a way to trick the database to do stuff that it doesn&#39;t want to do by injecting another statement into an existing one. Now with MySQL, it doesn&#39;t allow more than one query to be processed in one query statement so you don&#39;t have too much to worry about with it (could still be potentially hazardous, so still protect).

HOW IT WORKS

Checking if it is possible
This is a very simple process. Find a form on a page of the site you want to get in to. The simplest to work with are forgot password/username forms as they have the least amount of fields in them. This is going to be the example I am using here. Now fill out all the fields as you normally would. At the end of the the the e-mail field, enter a single quote, then submit the form.

Most SQL queries would look like this:
[code]&quot;SELECT fieldlist FROM table WHERE field = &#39;$value&#39;&quot;[/code]

The way php works is it will stick the actual value of the variable $value in its place. So, to find the password, a querie might look like this:
[code]&quot;SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = &#39;$emailV&#39;&quot;[/code]
The value we entered into the textbox on the form, would be stored as $emailV and would be substituted in place of it, making the new query this:
[code]&quot;SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = &#39;[b]example@company.com&#39;[/b]&#39;&quot;[/code]
If you don&#39;t see the problem alreay, I&#39;ll point it out. There is now an extra single quote on the end of the query. When the database tries to run this command, it will fail and return an error. This error will be expressed to you in a different way than an &quot;Incorrect email address&quot; error. If you get the database error, you can get into it.

Mapping the Database
Now that we know we can use this method to access there database, we have to start learning the fields that make up the database. This takes a bit of logic and a bit of guessing. We don&#39;t know what the names of the fields are, but we know that they will probably have a username, password, email, userNum, etc. field. To test and see if there are matches to these key values, we set up a new statement:
[code]&quot;SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = &#39;[b]poop&#39; AND emailfield IS NULL; --[/b]&#39;&quot;[/code]
The bold part is what we enter into the form. The &quot;emailfield IS NULL&quot; portion is the actual test for the field. We are checking to see if emailfield is a legitamate field in the database. This will com back with one of two errors. The first and much more common error would be a database error, which means that the field we guessed doesn&#39;t exist or is named something else. Just change the value around until you find it. The second error is the error we want. It is the error that says that the email could not be found. This means that the field you entered did exist. Congradulations! Complete this process for at least the username and password.

For our sake, lets say we found three keys:
[code]username --key--&gt; user
password--key--&gt; pass
email--key--&gt; mail[/code]

We have started to set up a schematic for the database. The new problem is, we don&#39;t know the table name. This can be a huge pain to get around. Note that even though I displayed the entire query in this example, we never see the whole thing, so we don&#39;t know the table name. The first thing we need to do is to find an existing table in the database. We do this in the same way, but change the query a little bit:
[code]&quot;SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = &#39;[b]poop&#39; AND 1=(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tablename); --[/b]&#39;&quot;[/code]
Now we are testing to see if tablename is an existing table in the database. The same errors still apply in the same way. If we get a &quot;Invalid email&quot; error, we found a table!

For our sake, the table we found was names mambers.

Our next task is to check if the table we found is the table housing the fields we found earlier. Again, we set up our code:
[code]&quot;SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = &#39;[b]poop&#39; AND members.mail IS NULL; --[/b]&#39;&quot;[/code]
Just like the last two, we have to deal with the same errors. If we get a database error, that means that the table members doesn&#39;t house the field mail. Just find another table and continue :D. However, if you get an &quot;Invalid Email&quot; error, then that table houses your key. You now have a map of the database:

[code]Table Name: Members
Fields: user, pass, mail[/code]

Actually doing anything

This is where you can actually do some damage. There is nothing more you can do here if you are trying to get into a MySQL, since it only supports one command at a time. Sorry. But against other databases, go on.

You can do several things here, like add new members, but only two things are damaging and I am only going to cover those two things.

Thing 1: Killing the table

By far the meanest, most evil thing you can do is to eliminate the table you found. Best part is, it doesn&#39;t have to be the table that you houses the field you want. The code to do this is:
[code]&quot;SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = &#39;[b]poop&#39;; DROP TABLE members; --[/b]&#39;&quot;[/code]
This creates two statements since the semicolon seperates SQL statements. The first statement tries to find the email in the database. We really don&#39;t care about the outcome of this. The second deletes the table members from the database. This is devastating to the server. Nothing using that table will be able to run. If there are no backups, the host will have to start over, re-registering every singe member. Devastating. DON&#39;T DO THIS. IT IS MEAN :D

Thing 2: obtaining another user&#39;s password

This is a much more practical use for this. It is a lot more useful than dropping an atom bomb on the website. Again we generate our code:
[code]&quot;SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = &#39;[b]poop&#39;; UPDATE members SET email = &#39;myemail@hotmail.com&#39; WHERE user= &#39;username[/b]&#39;&quot;[/code]
Now we have taken the user username&#39;s email address and changed it to ours. Now if we were to run this page again and enter our own email, we would receive an email telling us the password to the account username. And, if we wanted to be super devious, we would change the email back to something like suckme@yourpoop.haha and laugh. Now we have someone else&#39;s password to play around with.

There are other ways and other objectives to this, but these are the basics. You can do your own research if you want to go in further. Note: MySQL doesn&#39;t support this. Also, most site now-a-days block this.

HOW TO STOP IT

This is actually really easy to stop. There are several ways to stop it. They all involve parsing the string before actually putting it into the query. You can take out quotes all together, but them people might get angry that they can&#39;t put quotes. A better attempt would be to use the escape character &#39;\&#39; to take out dangerous characters. By putting the &#39;\&#39; in front of the quotes, you eliminate them ending one query statement and starting another.  The other thing you should watch out for is the the &#39;\&#39; itself. Do the same thing and add another &#39;\&#39; before it. 

However, the best method to combat this is super easy. If you recall, there is a fair amount of guessing names involed. Just put some randomization into your names. Give everything a little spunk. Instead of password, make it passmypoopheadword. Only you see these names, no one else will. Be creative :D

[i]EDIT: Well, the bold inside the code tags doesn&#39;t appear bold so the things you write in the text boxes are what is inside the [ b] tags. Thanks for bringing this to my attention :D[/i]</description>

<p>Which when injected would look like this</p>
<p>SELECT * FROM Members WHERE username=‘Admin’ or ‘1’=‘1’</p>
<p>Etc, you can do alot with this kind of thing, Bypassing logins, Retriving Variables from the MYSQL Server, such as Usernames and passwords etc. You could even inject some dangerous MYSQL commands and truncate the whole database table etc. Its pretty fun/funny. So to anyone who hasent already learnt SQL Injection, DO IT NOW! lol</p>

<p>Make your own <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Unfortunately, the you already know the names of everything, but if you made it with an include file with the names of everything, I’d be happy to fill those in (I wouldn’t make them impossible, or that would just be retarded lol). But like Mr Wicked said, people often forget about the GET variables (in fact, I didn’t even think of it until he mentioned it). All you need is for it to access the database and not edit out quotes and you’re set.</p>
<p>And you can still use SQL injection to get past MySQL logins, let me type up an example real quick…</p>
<p>A lot of times, this is what the login SQL statement will be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">SELECT * FROM usertable WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'</code></pre>
<p>Well, if you entered anything for the username and this for the password:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">' OR username='administrator</code></pre>
<p>You’ve created the new SQL statement:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">SELECT * FROM usertable WHERE username='blah' AND password='' OR username='administrator'</code></pre>
<p>This doesn’t even require that you use two statements and you can log in as the administrator (though you would need to know the administrator’s username, but that usually isn’t a problem).</p>
<p>EDIT: Well, you could still run into a problem here if the system encrypted it’s passwords, but it is easy to fix. Instead of playing wiht the password field, play with the username field. Assume the same SQL statement and enter this as the username:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">administrator' OR username='</code></pre>
<p>And you get this SQL statement:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">SELECT * FROM usertable WHERE username='administrator' OR username='' AND password='something encrypted'</code></pre>

              <p>Occasionally, form text boxes will have limits on how many characters you can enter. This can be a problem if you are trying to enter a long statement into the textbox that only allows 20 characters. However, you can create your own form and do whatever you want with it, as long as it is directed towards the same page and you name the fields the same.</p>
<p>I think more what BobDole is talking about is manipulating the hidden form values, since you can’t really do that from the actual form. Again, just create your own form and direct it to the same page as the actual form. You could even figure out a way to brute force with this method.</p>

a website that uses a search command.</p>

<p>Alot of websites forget to sanitise those variables and just query it, those and you can insert an SQL Inject right there.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Basically, this is a way to trick the database to do stuff that it doesn’t want to do by injecting another statement into an existing one. Now with MySQL, it doesn’t allow more than one query to be processed in one query statement so you don’t have too much to worry about with it (could still be potentially hazardous, so still protect).</p>
<p>HOW IT WORKS</p>
<p>Checking if it is possible<br>
This is a very simple process. Find a form on a page of the site you want to get in to. The simplest to work with are forgot password/username forms as they have the least amount of fields in them. This is going to be the example I am using here. Now fill out all the fields as you normally would. At the end of the the the e-mail field, enter a single quote, then submit the form.</p>
<p>Most SQL queries would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"SELECT fieldlist FROM table WHERE field = '$value'"</code></pre>
<p>The way php works is it will stick the actual value of the variable $value in its place. So, to find the password, a querie might look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = '$emailV'"</code></pre>
<p>The value we entered into the textbox on the form, would be stored as $emailV and would be substituted in place of it, making the new query this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = '[b]example@company.com'[/b]'"</code></pre>
<p>If you don’t see the problem alreay, I’ll point it out. There is now an extra single quote on the end of the query. When the database tries to run this command, it will fail and return an error. This error will be expressed to you in a different way than an “Incorrect email address” error. If you get the database error, you can get into it.</p>
<p>Mapping the Database<br>
Now that we know we can use this method to access there database, we have to start learning the fields that make up the database. This takes a bit of logic and a bit of guessing. We don’t know what the names of the fields are, but we know that they will probably have a username, password, email, userNum, etc. field. To test and see if there are matches to these key values, we set up a new statement:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = '[b]poop' AND emailfield IS NULL; --[/b]'"</code></pre>
<p>The bold part is what we enter into the form. The “emailfield IS NULL” portion is the actual test for the field. We are checking to see if emailfield is a legitamate field in the database. This will com back with one of two errors. The first and much more common error would be a database error, which means that the field we guessed doesn’t exist or is named something else. Just change the value around until you find it. The second error is the error we want. It is the error that says that the email could not be found. This means that the field you entered did exist. Congradulations! Complete this process for at least the username and password.</p>
<p>For our sake, lets say we found three keys:</p>
<p><code>username --key--&gt; user
password--key--&gt; pass
email--key--&gt; mail</code></p>
<p>We have started to set up a schematic for the database. The new problem is, we don’t know the table name. This can be a huge pain to get around. Note that even though I displayed the entire query in this example, we never see the whole thing, so we don’t know the table name. The first thing we need to do is to find an existing table in the database. We do this in the same way, but change the query a little bit:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = '[b]poop' AND 1=(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tablename); --[/b]'"</code></pre>
<p>Now we are testing to see if tablename is an existing table in the database. The same errors still apply in the same way. If we get a “Invalid email” error, we found a table!</p>
<p>For our sake, the table we found was names mambers.</p>
<p>Our next task is to check if the table we found is the table housing the fields we found earlier. Again, we set up our code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = '[b]poop' AND members.mail IS NULL; --[/b]'"</code></pre>
<p>Just like the last two, we have to deal with the same errors. If we get a database error, that means that the table members doesn’t house the field mail. Just find another table and continue :D. However, if you get an “Invalid Email” error, then that table houses your key. You now have a map of the database:</p>
<p><code>Table Name: Members
Fields: user, pass, mail</code></p>
<p>Actually doing anything</p>
<p>This is where you can actually do some damage. There is nothing more you can do here if you are trying to get into a MySQL, since it only supports one command at a time. Sorry. But against other databases, go on.</p>
<p>You can do several things here, like add new members, but only two things are damaging and I am only going to cover those two things.</p>
<p>Thing 1: Killing the table</p>
<p>By far the meanest, most evil thing you can do is to eliminate the table you found. Best part is, it doesn’t have to be the table that you houses the field you want. The code to do this is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = '[b]poop'; DROP TABLE members; --[/b]'"</code></pre>
<p>This creates two statements since the semicolon seperates SQL statements. The first statement tries to find the email in the database. We really don’t care about the outcome of this. The second deletes the table members from the database. This is devastating to the server. Nothing using that table will be able to run. If there are no backups, the host will have to start over, re-registering every singe member. Devastating. DON’T DO THIS. IT IS MEAN <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Thing 2: obtaining another user’s password</p>
<p>This is a much more practical use for this. It is a lot more useful than dropping an atom bomb on the website. Again we generate our code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"SELECT * FROM userinfotable WHERE email = '[b]poop'; UPDATE members SET email = 'myemail@hotmail.com' WHERE user= 'username[/b]'"</code></pre>
<p>Now we have taken the user username’s email address and changed it to ours. Now if we were to run this page again and enter our own email, we would receive an email telling us the password to the account username. And, if we wanted to be super devious, we would change the email back to something like suckme@yourpoop.haha and laugh. Now we have someone else’s password to play around with.</p>
<p>There are other ways and other objectives to this, but these are the basics. You can do your own research if you want to go in further. Note: MySQL doesn’t support this. Also, most site now-a-days block this.</p>
<p>HOW TO STOP IT</p>
<p>This is actually really easy to stop. There are several ways to stop it. They all involve parsing the string before actually putting it into the query. You can take out quotes all together, but them people might get angry that they can’t put quotes. A better attempt would be to use the escape character ‘’ to take out dangerous characters. By putting the ‘’ in front of the quotes, you eliminate them ending one query statement and starting another.  The other thing you should watch out for is the the ‘’ itself. Do the same thing and add another ‘’ before it.</p>
<p>However, the best method to combat this is super easy. If you recall, there is a fair amount of guessing names involed. Just put some randomization into your names. Give everything a little spunk. Instead of password, make it passmypoopheadword. Only you see these names, no one else will.
