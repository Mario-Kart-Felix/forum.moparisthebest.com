    <description>[center][b][size=14pt]Introduction:[/size][/b][/center]
Hello everybody, this is the F.A.Q. for the most commonly used bases. I will provide you all with a list of the bases that are supported in this topic. I basically made this topic to stop all these repeated questions that keep getting posted. Hopefully this will stop some [if not all] the questions being asked. If you see somebody asking a question that&#39;s supplied on this topic, just post a link to here so he will know to read through this before posting another question.

We [as a community] are very tired of seeing the same question getting asked over and over again. We need members to read through this to stop these repetitive question(s). I hope you use this!

[center][size=14pt][b]Questions:[/b][/size][/center]

[b]Questions.[/b]
[i]Answers.[/i]

[b]Where can I learn Java?[/b]
[i]You can learn Java [url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html]here[/url].[/i]

[b]How do I start my own private server?[/b]
[i]Follow [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,342685.0.html]this tutorial[/url].[/i]


[b]How do I port forward?[/b]
[i]Follow the step in the How to Start a Server tutorial or go to http://portforward.com/.[/i]


[b]Where do I download Java?[/b]
[i]http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp - it should be the first one listed.[/i]


[b]When I try to compile my Java files, the compiler prints &#39;&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command&#39;. How do I fix this?[/b]
[i]To fix this, you&#39;ll need to follow these steps:
Set your environmental variables. Environmental variables are what allows you to run your server with Java. We will firstly open &#39;My Computer&#39; and click &#39;View System Information&#39;. As you do this, a small applet displaying several tabs, and you will select the one that says &#39;Advanced&#39; and at the bottom, click &#39;Environmental Variables&#39;. Now what you&#39;re going to do, is go to your &#39;Path&#39; and &#39;Classpath&#39; variables and edit them.

In your Classpath variable, you&#39;re going to take everything currently inside it and edit it with your latest version of JDK, so right now it would be:
[code]CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_7\bin;%CLASSPATH%;[/code]
[i]If a newer version of JDK comes out, change the &#39;7&#39; to the newest update.

After you have done the Classpath variable, you&#39;re going to find the Path variable and add the code below inside it.
[code]C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_7\bin;[/code]

[i]The same goes for Path, if you download a newer version of JDK then you&#39;re going to change the &#39;7&#39; to your current JDK update. Once you&#39;ve done that, you&#39;ll need to edit your compiler batch file code to the one below:
[code]@echo off
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_07\bin\javac.exe&quot; *.java
pause[/code]
[i]You&#39;ll have to change the &#39;7&#39; once again to the JDK update you have downloaded.

Alternatively, you can use [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,375681.0.html]Lin&#39;s Environmental Variable Setter[/url].[/i]


[b]Where can I find *name here*?[/b]
[i]Use the [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=search]search feature[/url].[/i]
[IMG]http://i771.photobucket.com/albums/xx351/the-soul1/search.jpg[/img]


[b]How do I change my player rights?[/b]
[i]317 protocol: find your character folder, and where it says &#39;character-rights = x&#39;, change &#39;x&#39; to the player rights you want to be.
508 protocol: in the login class, search:
[code]if (p.username.equals(&quot;[/code]
[i]above that, add:
[code]if (p.username.equals(&quot;NAME&quot;)) {
	p.rights = x;
}[/code]
[i]change &#39;x&#39; to the player rights.[/i]


[b]What are the most common player rights?[/b]
[i]0 - normal player
1 - moderator
2 - administrator[/i]


[b]I&#39;m trying to add commands to my server, but I don&#39;t know where to add them. Where do they go?[/b]
[i]The customCommand() method in client class. Search &#39;customCommand(String command)&#39; and place your command under the method.[/i]


[b]When I run my server it says &#39;ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException&#39;. How come?[/b]
[i]The index you have entered in some file (the run console will show which file and which line) is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.[/i]


[b]How do I make certain buttons do things?[/b]
[i]It&#39;s called an action button, and it&#39;s handled in the clicking most packet (packet 185). The case label is used as the button&#39;s ID, and the code under it will be used to determine what happens when the button is clicked. (for more packets and their payload go [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,413688.0.html]here[/url]).[/i]


[b]Where do I find a decent client to use?[/b]
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,6915.0/topicseen.html


[b]Where can I find a list of decent tutorials?[/b]
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,463977.0.html


[b]When I run my server, the batch reads &#39;Error unable to startup listener on 43594 - port already in use?&#39;. Why?[/b]
[i]It&#39;s because there&#39;s another program occupying the port 43594 already. You need to terminate the connection.[/i]


[b]What&#39;s a good compiler code?[/b]
[i]From Taharok: [code]@echo off
@title Perfect Compiler
if exist &quot;%programfiles%\Java&quot; (call :compile &quot;%programfiles%\Java\&quot;) else (goto error)
:compile
for /D %%x in (&quot;%~1jdk*&quot;) do (set p=&quot;%%~x\bin\javac.exe&quot;)
if defined p (%p% -cp . *.java)
if defined p (goto end)
:error
echo You do not have Java installed. Please download it at the site that is about to load.
&quot;%programfiles%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe&quot; http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
:end
echo Finished!
pause
exit[/code]
[i]Remember that if this does not work, you must download java.[/i]


[b]Whenever I compile, it gives me errors![/b]
[i]Any compile error(s) can be solved using [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,438121.0.html]this[/url] topic, by deathschaos9. And if it&#39;s not there, feel free to ask in [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,349078.0.html]this[/url] topic. And if no one helps, please use Google.[/i]


[b]What is a private server?[/b]
[i]A private server is a remake of the Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing game. You can edit the game and make it to your likeing. You can edit the NPC&#39;s, the XP Rate, and anything you would like.[/i]


[b]How come MoparScape Client doesn&#39;t work?[/b]
[i]You need to download Java and install it.
If you have it then re install your client or re download the installer.
If that still doesn&#39;t work then go to http://www.moparisthebest.com/cache/cache.zip
then extract it to C:\.mpr_file_store_32 
then try running it again.[/i]



[b]What is JDK?[/b]
[i]JDK is a compiler well it allows you to compile your server.
Without it a hand made client may not work.
So if you get in to RS2 Private Servers make sure you download it.
you can get it from www.sun.com[/i]


[b]Is my ip 127.0.0.1?[/b]
[i] NO IT AINT THAT Seems like everytime some one posts this you either get a respond like for example:
Hello join our server now its 24/7 our ip is 127.0.0.1
REPLY 1: Noob
Reply 2: LOL!!!!
Reply 3: WOW ITS A GOOD SERVER LOL :P

127.0.0.1 is not your ip well not your internet ip
you will need hamachi or no-ip[/i]


[b]Is RuneScape Private Server Considered illegal?[/b]
[i]No, it is not considered illegal, since we have started to make our private servers from scratch like they did.
All we did was use their Cache [Which has textures objects etc]
And because we did not use the name [RUNESCAPE] over again :) and we would give credits if jagex wanted but i still think its legal other wise cops wuda been at your house[i]


[b]Is their a good way advertising my server?[/b]
[i]Yes their is just copy this and paste it in your new thread in Advertisement section.[/i]
[code][b][size=20] YOURSERVERNAME SCAPE[/size][/b]
===Hamachi Data===== //Add the hamachi part if your server runs wiht hamachi
Ham Networks: [network name here 1]-[network name here ???]
Ham Ip: 5.XX.XX.XX [replace XX with your Ham ip numbers]
Port: default or 5555 [usually its 43594 but 5555 on pk servers]
[Screenshots under then details after each one]




=========NO IP=========
IP: [your no ip here]
port: [your port here usually its 43594 but 5555 on pk servers]
and [screen shots and after each one a bit of detail to describe each one]
and some kind of motto or something :P [/code]


[b]When I try to log into MoparScape, it says I am already logged in.[/b]
[i]This means that the server you are trying to connect to suddenly logged you off. It still thinks that you are on. Either restart the client and try again to log in. Or ask the owner to restart the server which should log your guy off.[/i]


[b]When I try to log into MoparScape, it says &quot;Error connecting to server, hit cancel and start server&quot;?[/b]
[i]This simply means that the server that you are trying to connect to is down. Try going to the [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php]Server Status List[/url] and getting a different server ip. So don&#39;t worry. Just keep trying and you will get on one of them eventually.[/i]

[center][b]How to spawn an NPC:[/b][/center]
First, you need to find the spot you want to place your NPC at, when you get there, there&#39;s a command called &#39;mypos.&#39; You would use that command to find your coordinates. When you typed the command, you will see a message similar to &quot;X: #### Y: ####&quot; and those numbers would be your X and Y coordinates.

After you get your coordinates, you&#39;ll need to spawn your NPC. You&#39;ll want to open your &#39;spawn-config.cfg&#39; file (Data &gt; cfg &gt; spawn-config). Once you&#39;ve got that open, you will want to place the NPC in your coordinates you have.
Here&#39;s the layout of the spawn file:
[code]
spawn = npcId	xCoord	yCoord	height	walk	maxHit	attack	defense	description
[/code]
So to place your NPC, you would make it something like:
[code]
spawn = 1	3401	2093	0	1	0	0	0	Man
[/code]

That&#39;s how you spawn an NPC!



[center][b]How to change shop currency:[/b][/center]

So this is how to make your shop take some other sort of currency instead of coins. So basically, if you want it to be some sort of point given to a player, you&#39;ll want to open up your Player.java and under &quot;public int&quot; you place whatever sort of point you want, so it would look like:
[code=java]
myPoint,
[/code]
Save it.

After you&#39;ve done that, you&#39;ll want to open up PlayerSave and find &quot;case 2:&quot; and put your point to be an integer in there. It has to be an integer so that your server will know to place a number instead of a string or a character, or anything else that&#39;s not a number. Your code should look something similar to:
[code=java]
} else if (token.equals(&quot;myPoint&quot;)) {
p.myPoint = Integer.parseInt(token2);
[/code]

Then, you&#39;ll need to find &#39;characterfile.write(&quot;[CHARACTER]&quot;, 0, 11);&#39; and under that you&#39;ll need to post whatever your point is, again as an integer. This will be the layout of what you&#39;ll see in your character&#39;s text file. Don&#39;t forget to change the last number to however long your point name is in the quotes. It should look similar to this:
[code=java]
characterfile.write(&quot;myPoint = &quot;, 0, 10);
characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.myPoint), 0, Integer.toString(p.myPoint).length());
characterfile.newLine();
[/code]

Now, you&#39;ll need to open up your ShopAssistant and search for &quot;public void buyFromShopPrice&quot; and put something similar to:
[code=java]
		if (c.myShopId == ##) {
			c.sendMessage(c.getItems().getItemName(removeId)+&quot;: currently costs &quot; + getSpecialItemValue(removeId) + &quot; points.&quot;);
			return;
		}
[/code]
This will send a message that will tell the person who tries to view the value of anything from the shop that it costs a certain amount of points instead of coins.

Now, search for &quot;public boolean buyItem&quot; and you&#39;ll need to scroll down until you see &quot;if(c.myShopId == 47) {&quot; and at the end of the method, two brackets down, add something similar to:
[code=java]
                if(c.myShopId == ##) {
                	if (c.myPoint &gt;= TotPrice2) {
						if (c.getItems().freeSlots() &gt; 0) {
							c.myPoint -= TotPrice2;
							c.getItems().addItem(itemID, 1);
							ShopHandler.ShopItemsN[c.myShopId][fromSlot] -= 1;
							ShopHandler.ShopItemsDelay[c.myShopId][fromSlot] = 0;
							if ((fromSlot + 1) &gt; ShopHandler.ShopItemsStandard[c.myShopId]) {
								ShopHandler.ShopItems[c.myShopId][fromSlot] = 0;
							}
						} else {
							c.sendMessage(&quot;You don&#39;t have enough space in your inventory.&quot;);
							break;
						}
					} else {
						c.sendMessage(&quot;You don&#39;t have enough points.&quot;);
						break;
					}
                }
[/code]
This will tell the server to use the points that you created for the shop currency instead of using coins.



[center][b]How to change player rights:[/b][/center]

You&#39;ll need to open up whomever&#39;s character text file that you want to change. You&#39;ll need to find &quot;character-rights&quot; and the most common one is &quot;character-rights = 0&quot;

It&#39;s easy to change, just change the &#39;0&#39; to 1, 2, or 3. 1 is moderator, 2 is administrator and 3 is owner. Those are just the most common, there may be more depending on your source.



[center][b]How to change home:[/b][/center]

You&#39;ll need to open up your Config file and search for &quot;public static final int START_LOCATION_X&quot; and you should see:
[code=java]
	public static final int START_LOCATION_X = ####; // start here
	public static final int START_LOCATION_Y = ####;
[/code]
All you need to do is change the &quot;####&quot; to the coordinates that you want it to be.

Hello everybody, this is the F.A.Q. for the most commonly used bases. I will provide you all with a list of the bases that are supported in this topic. I basically made this topic to stop all these repeated questions that keep getting posted. Hopefully this will stop some [if not all] the questions being asked. If you see somebody asking a question that’s supplied on this topic, just post a link to here so he will know to read through this before posting another question.</p>
<p>We [as a community] are very tired of seeing the same question getting asked over and over again. We need members to read through this to stop these repetitive question(s). I hope you use this!<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">How do I port forward?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Follow the step in the How to Start a Server tutorial or go to <a href="http://portforward.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://portforward.com/</a>.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Where do I download Java?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a> - it should be the first one listed.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">When I try to compile my Java files, the compiler prints ‘‘javac’ is not recognized as an internal or external command’. How do I fix this?</span><br>
[i]To fix this, you’ll need to follow these steps:<br>
Set your environmental variables. Environmental variables are what allows you to run your server with Java. We will firstly open ‘My Computer’ and click ‘View System Information’. As you do this, a small applet displaying several tabs, and you will select the one that says ‘Advanced’ and at the bottom, click ‘Environmental Variables’. Now what you’re going to do, is go to your ‘Path’ and ‘Classpath’ variables and edit them.</p>
<p>In your Classpath variable, you’re going to take everything currently inside it and edit it with your latest version of JDK, so right now it would be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_7\bin;%CLASSPATH%;</code></pre>
<p>[i]If a newer version of JDK comes out, change the ‘7’ to the newest update.</p>
<p>After you have done the Classpath variable, you’re going to find the Path variable and add the code below inside it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_7\bin;</code></pre>
<p>[i]The same goes for Path, if you download a newer version of JDK then you’re going to change the ‘7’ to your current JDK update. Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to edit your compiler batch file code to the one below:</p>
<p><code>@echo off
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_07\bin\javac.exe" *.java
pause</code><br>
[i]You’ll have to change the ‘7’ once again to the JDK update you have downloaded.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,375681.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lin’s Environmental Variable Setter</a>.[/i]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Where can I find <em>name here</em>?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Use the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=search" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">search feature</a>.</span><br>
<img src="http://i771.photobucket.com/albums/xx351/the-soul1/search.jpg" alt width="313" height="33"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How do I change my player rights?</span><br>
[i]317 protocol: find your character folder, and where it says ‘character-rights = x’, change ‘x’ to the player rights you want to be.<br>
508 protocol: in the login class, search:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (p.username.equals("</code></pre>
<p>[i]above that, add:</p>
<p><code>if (p.username.equals("NAME")) {
	p.rights = x;
}</code><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">change ‘x’ to the player rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What are the most common player rights?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">0 - normal player<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">When I run my server, the batch reads ‘Error unable to startup listener on 43594 - port already in use?’. Why?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">It’s because there’s another program occupying the port 43594 already. You need to terminate the connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What’s a good compiler code?</span><br>
[i]From Taharok: <code>@echo off
@title Perfect Compiler
if exist "%programfiles%\Java" (call :compile "%programfiles%\Java\") else (goto error)
:compile

<span class="bbcode-i">Remember that if this does not work, you must download java.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Whenever I compile, it gives me errors!</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Any compile error(s) can be solved using <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,438121.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> topic, by deathschaos9.

<p><span class="bbcode-b">What is a private server?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">A private server is a remake of the Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing game. You can edit the game and make it to your likeing. You can edit the NPC’s, the XP Rate, and anything you would like.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How come MoparScape Client doesn’t work?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">You need to download Java and install it.<br>
If you have it then re install your client or re download the installer.<br>
If that still doesn’t work then go to <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/cache/cache.zip" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/cache/cache.zip</a><br>
then extract it to C:.mpr_file_store_32<br>
then try running it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What is JDK?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">JDK is a compiler well it allows you to compile your server.<br>
Without it a hand made client may not work.<br>
So if you get in to RS2 Private Servers make sure you download it.<br>
you can get it from <a href="http://www.sun.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.sun.com</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Is my ip 127.0.0.1?</span><br>

<p>127.0.0.1 is not your ip well not your internet ip<br>
you will need hamachi or no-ip[/i]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Is RuneScape Private Server Considered illegal?</span><br>
[i]No, it is not considered illegal, since we have started to make our private servers from scratch like they did.<br>
All we did was use their Cache [Which has textures objects etc]<br>
And because we did not use the name [RUNESCAPE] over again <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> and we would give credits if jagex wanted but i still think its legal other wise cops wuda been at your house[i]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Is their a good way advertising my server?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Yes their is just copy this and paste it in your new thread in Advertisement section.</span></p>
<p>[code]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=20] YOURSERVERNAME SCAPE[/size]</span><br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">When I try to log into MoparScape, it says I am already logged in.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">This means that the server you are trying to connect to suddenly logged you off. It still thinks that you are on. Either restart the client and try again to log in. Or ask the owner to restart the server which should log your guy off.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">When I try to log into MoparScape, it says “Error connecting to server, hit cancel and start server”?</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">This simply means that the server that you are trying to connect to is down. Try going to the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Server Status List</a> and getting a different server ip. So don’t worry. Just keep trying and you will get on one of them eventually.</span></p>

<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">How to spawn an NPC:</span>[/center]<br>
First, you need to find the spot you want to place your NPC at, when you get there, there’s a command called ‘mypos.’ You would use that command to find your coordinates. When you typed the command, you will see a message similar to “X: #### Y: ####” and those numbers would be your X and Y coordinates.</p>
<p>After you get your coordinates, you’ll need to spawn your NPC. You’ll want to open your ‘spawn-config.cfg’ file (Data &gt; cfg &gt; spawn-config). Once you’ve got that open, you will want to place the NPC in your coordinates you have.<br>
Here’s the layout of the spawn file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = npcId	xCoord	yCoord	height	walk	maxHit	attack	defense	description</code></pre>
<p>So to place your NPC, you would make it something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 1	3401	2093	0	1	0	0	0	Man</code></pre>
<p>That’s how you spawn an NPC!</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">How to change shop currency:</span>[/center]</p>
<p>So this is how to make your shop take some other sort of currency instead of coins. So basically, if you want it to be some sort of point given to a player, you’ll want to open up your Player.java and under “public int” you place whatever sort of point you want, so it would look like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">myPoint,</code></pre>
<p>Save it.</p>
<p>After you’ve done that, you’ll want to open up PlayerSave and find “case 2:” and put your point to be an integer in there. It has to be an integer so that your server will know to place a number instead of a string or a character, or anything else that’s not a number. Your code should look something similar to:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">} else if (token.equals("myPoint")) {
p.myPoint = Integer.parseInt(token2);</code></pre>
<p>Then, you’ll need to find ‘characterfile.write("[CHARACTER]", 0, 11);’ and under that you’ll need to post whatever your point is, again as an integer. This will be the layout of what you’ll see in your character’s text file. Don’t forget to change the last number to however long your point name is in the quotes. It should look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">characterfile.write("myPoint = ", 0, 10);
characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.myPoint), 0, Integer.toString(p.myPoint).length());
characterfile.newLine();</code></pre>
<p>Now, you’ll need to open up your ShopAssistant and search for “public void buyFromShopPrice” and put something similar to:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		if (c.myShopId == ##) {
			c.sendMessage(c.getItems().getItemName(removeId)+": currently costs " + getSpecialItemValue(removeId) + " points.");
			return;
		}</code></pre>
<p>This will send a message that will tell the person who tries to view the value of anything from the shop that it costs a certain amount of points instead of coins.</p>
<p>Now, search for “public boolean buyItem” and you’ll need to scroll down until you see “if(c.myShopId == 47) {” and at the end of the method, two brackets down, add something similar to:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">                if(c.myShopId == ##) {
                	if (c.myPoint &gt;= TotPrice2) {
						if (c.getItems().freeSlots() &gt; 0) {
							c.myPoint -= TotPrice2;
							c.getItems().addItem(itemID, 1);
							ShopHandler.ShopItemsN[c.myShopId][fromSlot] -= 1;
							ShopHandler.ShopItemsDelay[c.myShopId][fromSlot] = 0;
							if ((fromSlot + 1) &gt; ShopHandler.ShopItemsStandard[c.myShopId]) {
								ShopHandler.ShopItems[c.myShopId][fromSlot] = 0;
							}
						} else {
							c.sendMessage("You don't have enough space in your inventory.");
							break;
						}
					} else {
						c.sendMessage("You don't have enough points.");
						break;
					}
                }</code></pre>
<p>This will tell the server to use the points that you created for the shop currency instead of using coins.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">How to change player rights:</span>[/center]</p>
<p>You’ll need to open up whomever’s character text file that you want to change. You’ll need to find “character-rights” and the most common one is “character-rights = 0”</p>
<p>It’s easy to change, just change the ‘0’ to 1, 2, or 3. 1 is moderator, 2 is administrator and 3 is owner. Those are just the most common, there may be more depending on your source.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">How to change home:</span>[/center]</p>
<p>You’ll need to open up your Config file and search for “public static final int START_LOCATION_X” and you should see:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public static final int START_LOCATION_X = ####; // start here
	public static final int START_LOCATION_Y = ####;</code></pre>
<p>All you need to do is change the “####” to the coordinates that you want it to be.</p>
