    <title>[request]RuneCrafting for PimpScape[request]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-runecrafting-for-pimpscape-request/72450</link>
    <description>Hi, I am looking for a RuneCrafting tutorial for PimpScape, I only found one for TestScape and CheezScape (if PimpScape is CheezScape based (as I see some people says it is), please tell me). Can you please make one or send a link to one? If this is in wrong section, please DO NOT SPAM/FLAME!! Please just let a mod move it then!

Also if you can, please send me a link or make a tutorial for staffs to be like in the real RuneScape (not as you have a member staff in a non-member world, or all staffs are like the god staffs from Mage Arena, they shall be like the Real RuneScape staffs)!!

Thank you!!</description>
