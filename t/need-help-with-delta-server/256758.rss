    <title>Need help with delta server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-delta-server/256758</link>
    <description>Well, i think this is retarded, and i may be retarded. Sometimes when i update my server, like just adding objects, i try to log in, it logs me out right away, i end up having to extarct my back-ups, and trying again, yet it works, and sometimes, doesn&#39;t.

So when i log in, i see the &quot;Welcome to..........scape,&quot; sm, then auto disconnects me, any suggestings or help :)?</description>
