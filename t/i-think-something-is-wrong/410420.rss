    <title>I think something is wrong?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-think-something-is-wrong/410420</link>
    <description>Ok so my server is up. Me and my other owner are playing it from the same ip. But on my run.bat, i get some other ip&#39;s, saying that people tried to play my server, but it says: Connection from: (ip here) ClientHandler: Client null disconnected. &lt;ip address here&gt; My client.java in my source folder is at my ip (gergscape.no-ip.org) but here is what it looks like: [code]if (Server.equals(&quot;gergscape.no-ip.org&quot;) || Server.equals(&quot;localhost&quot;)) {
			return 1; [/code]
Im guessing its because its at localhost. What do i change localhost to?</description>
