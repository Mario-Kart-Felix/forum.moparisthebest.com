    <description>The wave sounds are very large so how do they fit in a 60mb cache?</description>

<p>The game server listens on port 43594. The update server (what eyeownyew was talking about) does actually listen on port 43595.</p>
<p>veer, is this something that’s relatively new or only with sound effects? For music, the format AFAIK is midi, but they’ve been using a custom soundbank ever since this update: <a href="http://services.runescape.com/m=news/the-feldip-hills-are-alive-with-the-sound-of-muuuusic" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://services.runescape.com/m=news/the-feldip-hills-are-alive-with-the-sound-of-muuuusic</a>.</p>

              <p>For one, the client does not store generated audio in WAV containers, but rather synthesizes said data at run-time using a homebrew wavetable synthesizer, and thus only stores relatively little data on-disk, e.g. for encoded pitch/amplitude envelopes, envelopes for pitch/amplitude modulation, impulse-response filter poles…</p>
<p><a href="http://musicdsp.org/files/Wavetable-101.pdf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Wavetable Synthesis 101, A Fundamental Perspective</a></p>
<blockquote>In any case, the amount of data being stored and used for this synthesis method is far less than just the PCM sample file of the note. This is because wavetable synthesis takes advantage of the quasiperiodic nature of the waveform to remove redundancies and to reduce the data set.</blockquote>
<p>While this is more CPU-intensive, it greatly saves space, though the client only generates 8-bit PCM at 22050 Hz and WAV is a fairly light-weight RIFF container.</p>
<p>P.S. All the data required for the WAV file is included in sounds.dat, which is a part of the mandatory config archive (<span class="hashtag">#2</span>), so all of this audio is in fact there. The audio that is requested on-demand in these old clients is actually only MIDI. The more you know.</p>
