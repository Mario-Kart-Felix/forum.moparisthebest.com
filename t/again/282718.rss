    <description>Ok i know i&#39;ve posted this before but i have never gotten a straight answer.
I have been struggling making any weapon look likes its sharp and i believe that there is a much more efficent way of doing it than i am.
Can someone tell me the [b]BEST[/b] way to make a weapon look like its sharp?</description>

that works… but u can also make a edge of it (and keep the original blade shape) by making lines a little off the part of the blade u want to be sharp… and use that line to make a new edge on it (blade will be slightly larger on appearance)</p>
