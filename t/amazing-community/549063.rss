    <description>So I&#39;ve been a member now for 16 days and one thing that stands out to me is the community of players. A lot of the guys I&#39;ve met are in their late teens to early twenties but not only that, everyone just seems to inclined to help one another out. The community feels like it did when I was a child.


Anyone feel the same thing?</description>

People are generally nicer; however, I have come across some assholes.</p>
<p>After doing a druid run, I was leaving the wildy and heading up the ladder to edge. There was a pure there, training with his gmaul and his cannon to kill skeletons; however, the area is not multi combat. He was using the cannon to fight lvl 40 skeletons 1 on 1 while also using the maul. When I mentioned he should go to a multicombat zone, he stopped what he was doing and followed me for the next 10 minutes to tell me that I should delete my account, and see a psychiatrist about the abuse I recevied as a child before I kill myself.</p>
<p>Tl;dr pures are still assholes</p>
