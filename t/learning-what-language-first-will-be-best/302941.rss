    <title>Learning what language first will be best?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/learning-what-language-first-will-be-best/302941</link>
    <description>Sorry about posting it in the wrong direction at first :P Clumsy me

Well im confused and i just want to be a pro coder like most of you guys are.
Uhm well im here just to ask which language out of all of them is the best to learn, this is my main question

Also which language is most easy and the hardest. I don&#39;t really care if you dont want to answer this question for it is not what i really want to know.

The only languages i know of but have not tried fully yet are;

[ul][li]
[/li][/ul]
Java
C#
C++
C
C+
Python
JavaScript
B[size=5pt]eginner[/size]asic
XML
PHP
HTML
ASP
SQL
CSS
Visual Basic

[ul][li][/li][/ul]

Those are all the languages ive heard of but im not sure what is best to start with? 

[center]Have any ideas? Please be as honest as you can

ALSO:
If you reconmend what language for me to start with could you also post a link for that specific link about how i can get started and stuff.</description>

<p>HTML and CSS are not and do not resemble in any way any programming languages.  They are just a way to store data, like an ini file or a configuration file.</p>
<p>So if you want to learn programming, don’t start with those, because even if you master them you won’t know anything about programming.</p>

<p>Sorry, said it in the wrong way  If you have absolutely no clue what programming is or how it works, go to step one. Otherwise, go right on ahead to step 2.</p>

<p>killer game programming in java??<br>

it helped me <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span> when i started with java[/quote]<br>
Lolz that link wouldn’t work so i googled Killer Game Programming in Java and it was at the top page</p>
<p>btw abraham2119 thanks for the download thing, i some how changed the link and turned it into a page viewer <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> but its to slow to use. But good for the Download List <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Is there a way to change the link and make it head for some what my forums?</p>
<p>Damn lothy… You can type alot 0.0 but since im dedicated to learning java i guess ill have to read it tomorrow.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>There’s not a chance in the world that I’d recommend a ‘game oriented’ programming book to a beginner; more often than not it will overlook many important aspects of the language, or simply skim over them - and that’s if it even includes a fundamentals section which, if the book is any good, it won’t.<br>
Game development books that try to be everything (jack of all trades) often lack substance in the areas necessary to make the book worthwhile.</p>
<p>For the record, there are actually books geared at new programmers that are written by Sun employees and officially supported by Sun. They bear the Sun logo in holographic form and are, more often than not, worth the effort to acquire (or the money to acquire legitimately).<br>
In my opinion though, the Sun website offers a wealth of knowledge and education for free - do try using that (the tutorial, which has already been linked to in an earlier post) before forking out money if you can.</p>
<p>EDIT: Left out my addendum to the information about Java that was provided by zstars.<br>
Yeah, it’s a simple language in that it lacks features that are, quite frankly, misused more often than they’re used correctly.<br>
Yeah, it’s an interpreted language, and yes there’s a good chance that some java software isn’t quite on par with a comparable native implementation written in C or C++ (however modern hotspot compiler technology has closed the gap, and the performance differences in the majority of applications are inconsequential – only in the most performance critical programs would you <em>need</em> to resort to a native language for fear of Java ‘not cutting it’. Ahead Of Time compilers are also available now, but most of the good ones are commercial).</p>
<p>Now for the good points about java that make it worth your while.<br>
The API is incredibly rich, even in the standard edition. It’s so vast, in fact, that you should be able to keep boilerplate (mundane) code to a minimum in your applications.<br>
Java software can be incredibly secure if written correctly; memory leaks are only ever an issue if you are working with objects that manage their own memory (ie, collections classes such as Stack and Queue implementations). All you have to do is declare variables within the smallest scope possible to ensure that memory management does a proper job; you don’t have to worry about deleting or free()ing pointers, you don’t have to worry about accidentally trying to re-delete or re-free() a pointer that hasn’t had NULL or zero assigned to it.<br>
Bounds checking is built in to the JVM, so you never have to worry about accessing non-existent indexes of an array (a block of memory), or writing beyond the end of that block of memory (overflows).</p>
<p>In short, I don’t think there’s anything inherently easier about Java than, say, C++ (or any given OOP language).<br>
You are ultimately dealing with a paradigm; the language, once you learn the grammar and feature set, becomes a non-issue.</p>
<p>On to projects.<br>
People are probably going to beat me over the head for this, but I always suggest an IRC bot, because you get to deal with so many aspects of the language (and programming/OOP design in general).</p>
<p>Firstly, IRC bots deal with string manipulation. You parse strings using regex, you create strings. The experience that you get with regards to regular expression usage is quite valuable.</p>
<p>Secondly, you deal with socket programming and the client-server model. This isn’t language-specific at all, but it’s something that’s nice to play with and certainly worth getting your head around.</p>
<p>Thirdly, most bots require things such as permissions and users; this means that you have to implement data types for those users and permissions. Will you take a highly granular approach to permissions (attributing permissions without basing them on a user class; for example, Joe Blogs may be able to kick and ban with the bot while someone else may only be able to run games), or will you take a far simpler approach (class-based permissions, where a user with class x can do something, and a user with class y can do all things that class x can do plus all of the things class y can do).<br>
When dealing with structures such as users you then start to deal with the collections API and generic programming. This is another aspect of the language that is well worth experiencing and using.</p>
<p>Another reason to do an IRC bot is that you learn to implement something designed by someone else, based on existing documentation. This is an important skill to have if you ever program professionally as most projects will revolve around you receiving an interface to implement, which will then be expected to just work when combined with whatever a second group is developing.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are more, but I think those reasons alone justify it as a project for the intermediate programmer. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
