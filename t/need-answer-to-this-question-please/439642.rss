    <description>Okay, So...
Someone gets their account hacked on a rsps server. Knows who hacked them and is reporting to admin/owner whatever.
If and when the owner investigates this, What will they do.? CAN they look at the IP address&#39;s of who logged onto the said hacked account, And also check what other accounts they have/hacked.? 
If they can how long does this take.. ? 

Thanks all.</description>

Yes they can investigate who the last person’s IP on the account was, if they looked in the character files. So if they have recovered the account it is not likely the IP will still be there. If that IP matches somebody elses, then it is that person 99% of the time. It would take like 1 minute</p>
