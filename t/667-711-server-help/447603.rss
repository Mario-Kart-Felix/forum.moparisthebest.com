    <description>Hello,
Im not a coder, neither am I a programmer, Im just making a server for the fun of it and for me to play with my friends, so anyone who is going to help me, it is really appreciated :)
Okay here&#39;s my problem, Im using the Disturbed files that I found in the downloads section, now Im making the server with hamachi and its running alright, but I want to know how to make a server with no-ip so that I won&#39;t need to get my friends to download hamachi and just makes everyone&#39;s life easier. I&#39;ve already looked at the portforwarding tutorials but I don&#39;t really get what I exactly have to do, so can anyone explain it to me in details and say every step that I have to follow to get the server running on the ip made by no-ip?
Thank you very much for your cooperation ^^</description>

              <p>Well first of all register on <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a>. Then make an ip for your server. Then you have to download the no-ip client and log in with your info and select the ip adress you made. After that you must portforward. You need the password to your router. There should be an option called forwarding or port forwarding. Look for that. (Connect to your router with 192.168.0.1 or with your ip adress, to get your ip adress go to <a href="http://ipchicken.com" rel="nofollow noopener">ipchicken.com</a>). Then when you see port forwarding you have to forward the port (43594) and you have to enter your ipv4 adress. To find your ipv4 adress open your cmd and type ipconfig then hit enter. After portforwarding you run the source, and you should have a client with your ip adress that you set so they can just run the client and log on. If you need any help download teamviewer.</p>
