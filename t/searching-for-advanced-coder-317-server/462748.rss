    <title>Searching for Advanced Coder 317 Server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/searching-for-advanced-coder-317-server/462748</link>
    <description>THIS IS A 317 SERVER WITH REVISIONS! I have hosted many servers before and have a basic knowledge of coding. However I am looking for someone with around 3-4 years of firm coding knowledge. I am looking for someone who knows how to add bosses, update client interfaces, Add minigames etc. If your interested let me know via a private message on here or login to my server and try to reach me on there. Best way to get a hold of me is by email which is &quot;ruebel.brock at gmail.com&quot; send me an email with your experience and what you know how to do. If you are good enough I may even pay you! But these are subjects we can discuss after the fact. So anyone interested shoot me an email</description>
