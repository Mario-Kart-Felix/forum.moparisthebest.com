So i need a hoster that, Can do this: 20/7 / handle 40-50 Players, czar based source,
I want an experinced hoster, that Isn&#39;t a noob, I dont have time for noobs I have a server to moderate &amp; Forums To moderate, so I&#39;m looking for a good hoster that&#39;s not bugging me 24/7

Reward: Now this is why most of you noobs are here, I&#39;d rather not buy dedicated, as most of them are about $35-50 To only host about 40, So im offering you $25 monthly, For your hosting.
