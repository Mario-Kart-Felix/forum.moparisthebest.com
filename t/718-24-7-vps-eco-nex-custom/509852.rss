    <description>Hello there,
My friend and I have been working very hard on an RSPS for our gaming community called ProjectFatality, we&#39;ve released a Garry&#39;s Mod server which has been quite a success and we&#39;ve chosen to expand.
We are still working on this RSPS, however it has reached a point where a large majority of the bugs are fixed and we can now release to the public. We&#39;re waiting on a domain to register with our website and as I said, we&#39;re still working on the server. I admit that it is a Matrix source, however I promise to make it unique unlike many other RSPS&#39;s.
PS: [size=6] We Need Staff [/size]
If you&#39;d like to download the client, here&#39;s a link:

We also have a webclient however we&#39;re waiting for domain to register:
[url=http://192.95.2.139/client.html]http://192.95.2.139/client.html[/url]
And here&#39;s are forums for the time being:
