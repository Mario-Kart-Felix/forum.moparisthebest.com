        <p>Alright, so I had an idea the other day. What if we constructed a server browser client, that networked out into a ton of other servers? Basically it would be a full screen application (default preference), that allowed you to browse a seemingly unlimited amount of servers, and forcing the servers on this list to utilize “project omega’s” (name that just sounded cool) API to send current players online, and tags and such along with it, you could browse all kinds of different private servers. Filtering by tags, players, etc. etc… Have favorite lists, blacklists, maybe even friends that show what server’s they’re playing (?)… When you chose a server, the client info and cache would be downloaded by the server browser (to avoid stupidity in some client’s cache downloading setup’s), and then the client would start in-frame in the full screen server browser (full-screen to support server’s with full-screen client’s) and you could play regularly.</p>
<p>Thought’s on this idea? Would it work? Would it be useful? Could it make a difference? That brings some other questions in like: If this were made, would it need to be moderated with quality control, or would it just be freedom to whatever developer or idiot wants to have his server on the list?</p>

Have 1 client. Make it work for as many servers as possible. Allow the port and ip to be changed. The rest is server sided.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">How are you going to manage that?</span><br>
In theory, you would have a wrapper or launcher type thing where each individual client code base would be downloaded and ran inside the program itself, somehow.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Are you gonna make an interface for server owners to update the cache links and versions?</span><br>
That would be the idea.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How are you going to verify that the cache is working and good?/What if the link 404’s?/what if the user zipped their data incorrectly?</span><br>
Of course that would all be handled by the server browser itself, as any good program should catch all possible user mistakes.</p>

<p>That’s where my point about quality control comes in at the bottom there.</p>
<p>Also, for the record, I’m not talking about developing this myself or with anybody else, merely just an idea I wanted to throw out there and discuss. Thanks for the feedback.</p>

        <p>Whether or not it works depends on the people developing it.<br>
If it will be useful, I honestly can’t say.</p>
<p>I enjoy doing some programming from time to time, and all of the programs I make are almost always based around making it as seamless and simple for even the most basic user to understand. So, something like this could actually be quite handy to a lot of people.</p>
<p>I feel like the community is too small for it to be used to it’s full effect though.</p>
