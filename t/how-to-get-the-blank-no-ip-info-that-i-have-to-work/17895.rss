    <title>How to get the (blank).no-ip.info that i have to work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-the-blank-no-ip-info-that-i-have-to-work/17895</link>
    <description>yes, i have followed others insctuctions so many time over and over deleting and redoing....i&#39;ve decided to just ask..i have a no-ip but everytime i logg in from my runmoparscape folder and &quot;start server&quot; it goes to that 127.0.0.1 and do you have you set it to start server no-ip.info? or is there another d\l that isnt a private server that i have not found. and in the &quot;FAQ&quot; i think they have what i want but it says account is suspended. thanks say anything that you might even think might help at all. 

thanks,
