    <description>For many years, people have told stories about &#39;haunted houses&#39; and how there are ghosts in them. Those storys had changed into people&#39;s beliefs. The question is, do you believe in ghosts?</description>

              <p>I’d like to say that ghosts don’t exist, but I am open to all possibilities. I believe that to solve a problem you have to be open to all possibilities no matter how ridiculous they seem to appear at first. A great example of this is the world being flat. If you did not understand the concept of gravity, you would not be able to grasp how the world could be round, as if you were on the bottom you would simply fall off. However, we now know that the world is indeed not flat. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Just keep that in mind when you read my reply.</p>
<p>Instead of saying ghosts exist, I tried thinking of how they could possibly exist. Is there any way we could explain with logical reasoning and scientific inquiry of the possibility of invisible entities that could interact with our world? I believe I may of came with a possible solution that allows for that. If you look about us everything is three dimensional. Even the computer screen is three dimensional, because if you look at it really closely it will have imperfections and curvatures making it three dimensional not two dimensional. Now, we can assume that everything in our world is three dimensional because everything is composed of three dimensional objects (known as atoms). Please also forgive me for dismissing superstring theory which assumes there is 10 spatial dimensions. In that case everything has 10 dimensions since everything is composed of strings. But the question I then asked myself was, does everything have to be composed of those three dimensional objects? What if, per say, there was a different object, that didn’t have our first three spacial dimensions, which we perceive and light permeates through, but a fourth spatial dimension? It would exist on our world at that instant because it would have a common time dimension, but have a different spatial dimension. We would not be able to see it but it would still be here with us. Then the question is how can we test hypothesis?</p>
<p>Then I’d like to bring attention to MacDougall’s experiments. I recognize that they have flaw and perhaps no merit, but I believe it is a good example nonetheless. He measured weight loss at the instant of death of some individuals. However, the equipment had some error and people have proposed where the weight loss could of came from besides the soul. I would like the experiment to be done now with higher degrees of precision, but alas I cannot find any repeated experiments of this sort. But let’s suppose that MacDougall’s experiments were correct and there was indeed a mass loss. That means that the soul exists but we cannot see it. Perhaps the soul is composed of this “object” that only has a fourth dimension? This could explain how it can leave a vacuum (confined by the three spatial dimensions the soul does not have). This could also explain walking through walls and every sort of thing ghosts “can do”. Besides perhaps lifting objects and touching people, but perhaps energy permeates all dimensions and therefore we can exert energy onto them and they can exert energy onto us.</p>
<p>Next thing I would also like to bring to light is the multiple dimension aspect. In superstring theory, scientists suppose that the reason we do not see the other 7 spatial dimensions is because they are really small and tightly coiled. Personally, this makes no sense to me. How can a dimension have a dimension? Dimensions permeate through everything and are infinite. You can’t say a dimension has a limit. Perhaps the reason we cannot see these other dimensions is simply because our eyes can only perceive three, or that we are made of three of the ten spatial dimensions. This would really put a new spin on particle physics, though. Just some food for thought on the subject.</p>

<p>For many years, people have told stories about ‘haunted houses’ and how there are ghosts in them. Those storys had changed into people’s beliefs. The question is, do you believe in ghosts?</p>

              <p>no, and someone whom’s gullible enough to believe should believe. people believe in ghosts because of coincidence and/or the environment. furthermore, by people passing mislead information around like: “oh i think ghosts are real because my door moved!”, make the gullible people believe, and this information just goes all over.</p>
<p>i mean if you think about it like this: what determines a ghost… if it’s someone who picks souls to becomes ghosts…surely the world would be infested with ghosts and not just 1 or 2.</p>

I mean, I’m Agnostic so I could imagine something like them possibly existing, but not like we see the modern ones.  I doubt if a human dies a horrible death they stay in the house until a priest blesses the place or whatever.  Most people that claim to see them don’t really have any evidence and if they did it probably was more of something of them being tired from just waking up from a nightmare, happened to me all the time after I played <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/189227" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Exmortis</a>.[/quote]the intro creeped me lol</p>
