    <title>Only one 6x9 working after battery drain</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/only-one-6x9-working-after-battery-drain/403074</link>
    <description>Quick question, hoping someone might have a possible solution. 

Left my lights on my car today and totally drained the battery. Got it bump started and everything&#39;s fine except one of my 6x9s doesn&#39;t seem to want to work properly. When I have music going I can hear a faint sound from it but barely anything. It was working perfectly before the power drain. I&#39;ve checked all the obvious things like connections, amp, EQ etc, but can&#39;t get anything from it. Just about to go and have another fiddle around, but if anyone has any suggestions on would could of caused this then pls.

Cheerrzz

Edit - Just traced all the speaker wires back to the Head Unit and nothing wrong. I don&#39;t get this?? If I get time tonight I will quickly do a speaker swap on the amp...</description>
