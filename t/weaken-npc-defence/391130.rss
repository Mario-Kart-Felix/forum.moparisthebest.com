    <description>Base is Devo 7

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a new player that joined the server, and you decided to attack a rat. You&#39;ll be wearing a bronze longsword and a wooden shield and hitting 0s for about 10-15 seconds and then hit a 1 then you have the rat hitting 1s and 2s and owning you 2-3 times before you kill it.

How do I make it easier for you to hit on the rat?</description>
