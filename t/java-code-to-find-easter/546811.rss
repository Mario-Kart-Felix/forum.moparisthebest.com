    <title>Java code to find Easter</title>

    <description>I need someone to follow these instructions and produce the code so I can see what I did wrong in mine, thanks.

Use the following 11-step algorithm to write a program to calculate the month and day on which Easter falls for any date after 1700.

Make life easy for yourself: use the same single letters as variables as are used in the algorithm.

Calculate the day and month on which Easter falls given the year.

Let y be the year.

Divide y by 19 and call the remainder a. Ignore the quotient.

Divide y by 100 to get the quotient b and remainder c.

Divide b by 4 to get the quotient d and remainder e.

Divide 8 * b + 13 by 25 to get the quotient g. Ignore the remainder.

Divide 19 * a + b – d – g + 15 by 30 to get the remainder h. Ignore the quotient.

Divide c by 4 to get the quotient j and remainder k.

Divide a + 11 * h by 319 to get the quotient m. Ignore the remainder.

Divide 2 * e + 2 * j – k – h + m + 32 by 7 to get the remainder r. Ignore the quotient.

Divide h - m + r + 90 by 25 to get the quotient n. Ignore the remainder.

Divide h - m + r + n + 19 by 32 to get the remainder p. Ignore the quotient.

Easter falls on day p of month n. For test purposes, Easter in 2014 falls on day 20 of month 4.

Print out your results in the form: In the year 2001 Easter falls on day 15 of month 4. You do not need to supply the actual month name, only the number of the month. (Month names become much easier to deal with when we get to arrays, later in the class.)

Warning: there are a number of Easter Day algorithms on the Internet. I’ve modified this one slightly to clear up possible confusion between “a” as a part of speech and “a” as a variable name. (Otherwise you end up with something that reads: “get a remainder a” which is confusing.</description>
