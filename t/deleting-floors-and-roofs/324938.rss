    <title>Deleting floors and roofs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deleting-floors-and-roofs/324938</link>
    <description>Okay so i want to delete a bulding , i know how i delete the walls and stuff, but how do i delete the floor and the roof??

For roof just do upheight and then add the coord to deleteobject??

And how about the floor?? its not really a floor but im talking about the texture on the ground i want to change it into grass to costomize my home.
I can edit the whole texture, but all of those places where this kind of texture is added will change too, and i only wanna remove 1 bulding.

Is this possible ??
Probably but does anyone know the answer?? i hope so.
Please i need some help here guys.</description>
