    <description>I have 2 [317] rsps&#39;s and one of them has stopped working properly and so now am using the other one. The one that stopped working had the perfect 4-spec models for the dragon claw spec. and the one that I am working on now doesn&#39;t. Is there any was I could transfer/replace the good dragon claw models from the broken server to the server I am working on now?</description>
