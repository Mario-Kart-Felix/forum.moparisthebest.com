    <title>How to make weapons only for owner?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-weapons-only-for-owner/191805</link>
    <description>Like i got a perfect ring, if i wear it.

Then only Owners can wear it with 3 player rights.

If one with 1 2 or 0 player rights wants to wear then it says: You can&#39;t wear this item, its only for owners.

Then he cant wear it.

Thank you,
