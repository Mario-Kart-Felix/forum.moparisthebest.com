              <p>Okay… If I were you, I wouldnt use the 127.0.0.1… Id download some type of source (found in the downloads section) and winRar. Then, go to shops.cfg, open it, and put the shop number (one last higher than the last), and put what it sells (first a 1 or 2). Youll know the rest when you open. Shops, I dont know lol.</p>
