<p>RuneWars is a new RPG server that has opened in 2013. Unlike other servers our friendly team of staff are dedicated in bringing you the best possible experience. At the core of what we offer is a crafted land that gives you the opportunity to explore and discover; experience quests, learn stories, battle with magic, find loot, defeat bosses and most importantly… fight for your Caste.</p>
<p>Prove your worth to progress through the Caste which you represent and gain the ability to reach new plains and use new abilities. When you are a stout veteran who has fought many battles, you may even be asked to represent your Caste in the Rune Wars.</p>
<p>Which Caste will you choose? - Make your choice on: <span class="bbcode-i"><a href="http://play.runewars.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">play.runewars.org</a></span></p>
<p>[center]<a data-bbcode="true"><img src="http://i1171.photobucket.com/albums/r553/master294/Test19_zpsa87a0d33.png" alt width="" height=""></a>[/center]</p>
<p>[center][size=5]<span class="bbcode-b">Important: Server is closed for re-development. More info at <a data-bbcode="true">Site</a></span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[center][size=5]<span class="bbcode-b"><img src="http://i1171.photobucket.com/albums/r553/master294/Test5_zpsf1265beb.png" alt width="" height=""></span>[/size][/center]</p>

<p>In the RuneWars world, there has been an age-long conflict that has shattered every balance of power. Only recently has several powers emerged, these powers are known as <span class="bbcode-u">Castes</span>. Each Caste offers a selection of abilities and perks that allow you to evolve your fighting. Upon first joining the server, you will be taken through the basic’s and introduced to each Caste, at this point you will choose your Caste.</p>
<p>Once in a Caste you will only be the first rank, you still need to prove your worth to be rewarded with the next rank and more abilities. This is completed by having enough ‘Quest Points’ and ‘Money’. Quest points are gained by completing the quests of the many people who inhabit this world. Money is earned through both quests and trading. Once you have enough, you will be able to trade these for the next rank.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The ranks:</span><br>
[ul][*]<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Convict: </span></span>First rank of the server; your time as a hard-working labourer has ended and you must learn the ropes before being shipped out into the dangerous world.[/ul]</p>
<p>[ul][*]<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Wanderer: </span></span>Lacking a Caste to call home after your time imprisoned, you are wondering the world and learning of the battles and trials which the free must currently endure.

<p>[ul][*]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">?Ranger | Trainee | Duellist: </span></span>Your choice has been made, a Caste has accepted you into their ranks.

<p>[ul][*]<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Dusk Spy | <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Neophyte </span></span>| Echo: </span></span>Having impressed your Caste and paid their training fee, you now have access to new /spells and abilities. <span class="bbcode-b">Cost:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">$20,000 &amp; 15 Quest Points</span>[/ul]</p>
<p>[ul][*]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Bane Hunter | <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Disciple </span></span>| Reaver: </span></span>New opportunities present themselves to those who explore, as you have quickly learnt.

<p>[ul][*]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Temporal | Deacon | Summoner:</span></span> Dedication has proven that you do indeed have loyalty for your Caste, in return they reward you with a great honour; the right to fight for them in the rune battles.
