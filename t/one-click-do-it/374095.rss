    <title>One click, do it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/one-click-do-it/374095</link>
    <description>You know on Runescape and Pali servers it is usually one click object and then it does what it is supposed to do even if the object is miles away like a tree, it will run upto it and then chop without the need of another click.
