    <title>SolumScape -- Help With My Ideas</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solumscape-help-with-my-ideas/266590</link>
    <description>With this topic, I&#39;m just after a little advice. I&#39;m got this idea that I&#39;ve been working on (on a 508) and I need a little advice. I&#39;m going to explain what happens when you join the server and then explain my problems, and see if you guys can help me.

[i]When you first join the server, your put in &#39;otherworld&#39;. In this world, your character doesn&#39;t have a form. He&#39;s just a bunch of sparkles. He can choose two different portals. One of the tauren and one of the beast. The tauren consists of beings like minotaurs, centaurs, humans and other &#39;humanoid&#39; type creatures. The beast consists of ork, goblins and giants and other creatures. 

You play the game, in which, when you die, you can return to otherworld or you can inhabit the earth as a spirit for a while (possessing suit of armour and becoming things like animated armour). Well, a setup like this doesn&#39;t allow for anything but a human to wear armour or weapons, rares and capes or anything (except maybe minotaurs who can can become rune minotaurs, etc.), without going to extreme lengths to add it in.

Basically, does anyone have any ideas that can make this server worth while playing for anyone that hasn&#39;t chosen the human race? I mean, I could limit the items, so teams are a bit more balanced, but what can I give the other races that make it fun for them to play also. Any ideas?

Many thanks,

Syrillia.[/i]</description>

<p>Well, I’ve decided to seperate the skills out between the races. Maybe 3 each (this allows other races to be added in future). I’m definately give construction to orks. This allows them to build small camps which other orks can use to ‘tunnel into’. Tunneling will be the beast version of teleporting. But I need something to make the game more interesting if you cant wear items, etc. Any more ideas?</p>
