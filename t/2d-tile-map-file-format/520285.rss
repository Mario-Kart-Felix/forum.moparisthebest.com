    <title>2D tile map file format</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2d-tile-map-file-format/520285</link>
    <description>File format for a 2D tile based region (think pokemon-esque)

First byte = region id
4 bits - number of different referenced tilesheets
1 byte for each difference referenced tilesheet id, first one would be relative tilesheet id 0, etc.


For each tile:
1 bit - blocked? (for those that don&#39;t know, means you can&#39;t walk through it)
3 bits - layer empty? (111 would mean all 3 layers have a tile id, 010 would mean only the middle layer has a tile id)
2 bytes for each tile layer: (if 3 active layers, would be 6 bytes for the tile, etc)
AAAABBBB BBCCCCCC
A = 4 bits, relative tilesheet ID
B = 6 bits, tile X from tilesheet
C = 6 bits, tile Y from tilesheet

[u][b]Example:[/b][/u]

[u]Header:[/u]
01001011 (Region 75)
0011 (3 different tilesheets referenced in this map)
00000011 [Tilesheet 3, relative ID 0] 
00011001 [Tilesheet 25, relative ID 1] 
00101000 [Tilesheet 40, relative ID 2]


[u]Actual map:[/u]
[i]Tile 0, 0[/i]
0 (not blocked)
110 (2 active layers)
0001 (relative ID 1)
010111 010110  (23, 22)
0000 (relative ID 0)
000001 000000  (1, 0)
[i]Tile 1, 0[/i]
1 (blocked)
100 (1 active layer)
0010 (relative ID 2)
010110 010110  (22, 22)
etc


[u]Map file size assuming a 64x64 map with all 3 layers always used: (note this is a worst-case scenario, most of the time you wont be using all 3 layers)[/u]
26 kilobytes

Thoughts, comments, ideas on how I could make it smaller, what you think I should change, etc?</description>

              <p>Or, you can just be lazy and write a format that’s quick to parse but mostly unconscious to compression, then use some sort of RLE or dictionary-based compression algorithm that massively sizes it down. That’s mostly what I do these days, though it’s also really fun to develop your own lossy compression algorithm that stacks with a RLE or dictionary-based, meaning you can even size the data down significantly further, at the cost of minimal precision loss.</p>

There wasn’t in a lot of even Gameboy games, where your workable RAM was only 4KB and the ROM was 1MB max. The only data compressed in the Pokemon generation 1 games are the Pokemon. The Megaman Xtreme games don’t compress their maps. Neither do several other games.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the info, Bowser jr. It is a bit weird how they layout their layers, but it makes a lot more sense now. I think all David can pull from that system is possibly a third layer for pseudo-weather, but I think an overlay or post-processing shader effects would be more convenient, depending on how he does it. So I still stand by the 2 layer + objects list style.</p>

              <p>Interesting, Bowser.</p>
<p>Well I need some help, I’m brainfarting while drawing the code to center the map around the player.</p>

		int tilesWide = (getWidth() - offsetX)/tileSize + 1;
		int tilesTall = (getHeight() - offsetY)/tileSize + 1;
		System.out.println(tilesTall);
		for (int y = 0; y &lt; tilesTall; y++) {
			for (int x = 0; x &lt; tilesWide; x++) {
				Tile t = r.getTile(x+xStart, y+yStart);
				g2.setColor(t.getColor());
				g2.fillRect(offsetX + x * tileSize, offsetY + y * tileSize, tileSize, tileSize);
				g2.setColor(Color.WHITE);
				g2.drawString((x+xStart) + ":" + (y+yStart), offsetX + x * tileSize, offsetY + 32 + y * tileSize);

		g2.translate(-originX, -originY);
		g2.setColor(Color.RED);
		g2.fillRect(xI-10, yI-10, 20, 20); //my cute little square player :3</code><br>
xI yI are just temporary variables I’m using for debugging at the moment, those would normally be the coordinates of the center of the player. And obviously Tile wont have a color variable, that’s also for debugging until I make some maps.</p>
<p>Anyways, I have the update loop changing xI and yI around so I can watch the map move, and it’s working great if the origin is moving up and left (ie, the index =&gt; 0), but if the index =&gt; r.getWidth() [the number of tiles wide the region is], I will get an out of bounds exception right at the end. In other words, it’s trying to draw the x or y index being 30 when it can only go 0-29.</p>
<p>Picture reference. In this case, the map was scrolling down until it hit 29, but it would then try to render  [X, 30] and give me a NPE.<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/34DCn.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I have a feeling one of my calculation logics is just a tiny bit off, and I could use a fresh pair of eyes.</p>

You don’t colide with them, but they are drawn over you.</p>
<p>A little mistake in my layer list.<br>
Solid parts of roofs/treetops are in both layer 1 and 2. (Don’t ask me why)</p>
<p>EDIT: Pokemon emerald’s layers make no sense at all.  But shows some pattern.<br>
Layer 0 is text boxes and interface. Layer 1 is nearly the same as in Zelda, but some include some solid parts of the roof and chimney(?). Layer 2 makes is terrain(ish).  Layer 3 contain textures to be drawn under elements like dirt paths so such elements can be used on many different terrains.</p>
<p>EDIT 2:<br>
If I were to make the layers myself it would be.<br>
0: Non solid items that would be drawn over you.<br>
NPC/Monster/player layer.<br>
1: Elements on the map like rocks, houses… with transparent background.<br>
2: Basic terrain. (Grass, dirt…)<br>
3: Lighting/weather effects. In Zelda it isn’t mapped 1:1 to the rest of the map, so it is more dynamic than baking it into the rest of the layers.<br>
X: You also need the collision map as described by you earlier, but this should be handled by the map elements and not in the file.<br>
Taharok might not like it, but it makes map making quite dynamic. And before Taharok kills me, you would combine 1 and 2 on runtime, so you draw them quicker.</p>

Just a bit of feedback on the per-tile information, I very rarely see games need 3 layers. They may provide the illusion of having three layers, since there are tiles you can walk on (layer below), tiles you cannot walk on (same layer), and tiles that are above you when you walk on them (layer above). Nevertheless, even for tiles that are semi-transparent being drawn on a background tile, that’s still only 2 visual layers. I pretty much never see transparent tiles on transparent tiles on an opaque tile (3 layers). Reconsider just implementing 2 layers and implementing some nice editor tricks for making it seem like 3. Unless, of course, I’m misunderstanding your intended goals.[/quote]GBA game use 4 layers. I’m sure the DS does the same or something similar.[/quote]</p>
<p>Interesting. What are the four layers used for? Do you have any screenshots to show a situation where anything more than 2 layers is actually necessary? I can see situations where 4 layers would be very nice, but typically it’s overkill. This is true even for terrain blending in modern 3D engines, as well. A lot of modern engines support infinite layers, but a game usually only needs 2-4ish, depending heavily on the blending techniques used.</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:14, topic:520285”]I don’t mean they would all be actional objects, just objects in general that would be on the second layer(bushes, flowers, etc), but yea some of them would be actionable. But ignoring actions for now, can you explain what you meant a bit further, specifically ‘editor tricks’ to make the two layers appear like three.</p>
<p>Also slightly unrelated, but for a grid-by-grid walking system instead of free roam, do you know if it matters if I have a static screen size and have the regions match it (the map never moves), or have the map centered on the player (would mean larger regions), or something else? Or which players would prefer?[/quote]</p>
<p>I just mean that most situations can be done using two layers, instead of needing more. Some people may think there are different levels of background geometry (ie grass, stone, dirt, etc.) and thus each level can be represented by a different layer, where you just control some blend factor between them (more evident in terrains than in tilemaps, but similar idea). Although this works perfectly well and is quite convenient to develop, it’s not common for a single tile to be blending between all four or even three of the types in question. Usually you only see blending between stone and dirt, dirt and grass, etc. Rarely do you need to support blending (or a mixture) of all three simultaneously. Thus, even though multiple layers is convenient, most of the time you are only going to see a single background type tile and a single foreground type tile together.</p>
<p>You mention lighting tiles. That would be an excellent example of when a third layer would be quite convenient to support. You have several options in this case. You could bake multiple layers together, thus only requiring 2 or even 1 single layer, otherwise you can add more layers and increase the amount of blending. Essentially, it’s a CPU versus memory situation, since baking is a one-time cost with a memory loss and a draw time gain. Adding more layers saves memory but requires more draw time. To each their own.</p>
<p>I’m not exactly sure what you mean by the movement system. Regardless of the region size, you’re still going to need to stitch the regions together so when the camera moves past the edge of a region, it’s viewing parts of multiple regions at one time. The camera being centered on the player is a good option, though. It’s really up to you from a design perspective. If you prefer the way pokemon does it, then center the camera on the player, making sure to add constraints to stop the camera when you’re on the edge of the loaded area (unless it’s truly seamless, in which case you have to be careful when you’re on the edge of the entire game world). Otherwise if you really like the area-by-area feel, you could make it so the camera is centered on the region, like you mentioned, and just load a new region everytime the player goes off screen, moving the player to the other side and continuing with the new area. I can’t give you advice one way or the other, because it’s a completely opinionated decision.</p>

<p>I wasn’t aware you wanted object support. You could support “objects” just by making certain tiles “actionable,” wherein you can perform an action on them by some key or walk over or something. That way you’re only introducing a single bit per tile instead of needing another ID. If you really need object support, then it will be similar to three layers to store the object ID, but you could also store a list of objects separate from the tile data, then store a locator for each ID which represents which tile the object exists on (a bit opposite to I was saying above). This is a good solution because there will be few objects, so you’ll end up saving a lot more space this way versus storing a “null object” for most of the tiles, since most will probably not have an object.</p>
<p>All depends on what you’re planning on doing with it.</p>

Layer 0 (below), Layer 1 (above), objects (below)</p>
<p>Then I would have to have a list of all of the objects and their relative sprite ids as well, and I don’t see how storing that object ID would be easier than storing the tileid as a different layer. Unless I’m misunderstanding what you mean.</p>

The main reason I’m using X and Y coordinates instead of having a huge tile atlas with every tile is exactly for that reason, it doesn’t matter how many sheets I have, it’s completely expandable until I get to 255 tilesets (# of tiles completely expands) or if I need to reference more than 15 tilesets in a single map, which I think is outrageous. I estimated I’d never need more than 5, so I figured 15 was over-the-top.</p>

Besides, it’s not at all noticeable but you’re hurting performance this way by taking more cycles than just reading a couple bytes for tile properties.[/quote]The maps wouldn’t be sent that way at all, or used at all in bitmap format once it gets read initially. As for reading it, you’re right it would be very slightly less efficient this way, but I’m talking more about file format to make it as small as possible.</p>

<p>And I figured it might tie well into a tutorial I was going to release about bit manipulation and how you can use it for file saving, wanted to make sure I got my information at least somewhat correct (been a while since I’ve done any of this stuff)</p>

<p>Not when its 26kb. That’s plenty small. Don’t trade quality for redundant performance. If it doesn’t run slow, then you shouldn’t worry about performance.[/quote]What do you mean ‘quality’?</p>
