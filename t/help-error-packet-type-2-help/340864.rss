    <title>[HELP] Error Packet Type 2 [HELP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-error-packet-type-2-help/340864</link>
    <description>Ok, first of let&#39;s get some things straight:
-Im new, yes woop de do.
-Ive searched endlessly for a fix for this..ENDLESSLY!
-I AM using Bluur&#39;s client, BUT it has been edited and renamed as DDSpeced V3.1 Bug Fix....I DID leach, and will give credits when i am done.
-I have Testing new Clients, and worked out that it ISN&#39;T the client BUT the Server.

Ok, from my conclusions its not a Client-side problem it&#39;s Server-side, It&#39;s either a playerHandling, playerLoading, playerSaving or playerAssitance (My Player.java Files)..This previously happened and i just restarted, but ive done MUCH more since i restarted the server and do not wish to re-start so can someone please take a look at the Source and Client and tell me whats wrong?

Here is an image of the server, Client and java client.

Please comment something more than, &quot;It&#39;s Client sided&quot;, &quot;Probably Models&quot; or &quot;Try Client.java&quot; and not specify what to look for...

I&#39;ll help the person who helps me as much as i can with whatever i can.

Thanks,
