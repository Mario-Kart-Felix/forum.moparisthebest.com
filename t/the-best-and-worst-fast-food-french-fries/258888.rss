    <title>The Best (and Worst) Fast-Food French Fries</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-best-and-worst-fast-food-french-fries/258888</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Worrying about calories seems silly after you&#39;ve consented to a French fry grease-fest, but sometimes you can&#39;t help it.  During one such conflicted experience, I wondered if some fast-food fries were less hard on the body than others. Looking at the nutritional facts of some common French fry purveyors, I found that you can, indeed, save some serious calories if you know which fries to buy. 

I looked at these seven:
-Arby&#39;s Curly Fries
-Burger King&#39;s French Fries
-Carl&#39;s Jr.&#39;s Natural-Cut Fries
-Dairy Queen&#39;s French Fries
-Jack in the Box&#39;s Natural Cut Fries
-McDonald&#39;s French Fries
-Wendy&#39;s French Fries

Notes: The numbers below are estimated reports by each restaurant&#39;s official website at the time of this article.

Calorie-wise:

The Best
Dairy Queen wins with 2.69 calories/gram
Jack in the Box is close behind with 2.71 calories/gram

The Worst
McDonald&#39;s it is, with 3.25 calories/gram

Those stats may sound like just a few calories&#39; difference, but that&#39;s a 21% difference, which adds up since a large serving tends to be around 190 grams.


But there are other stats to look at...

Here&#39;s the zero trans fat team:
Burger King
Carl&#39;s Jr.
Dairy Queen
McDonald&#39;s
Wendy&#39;s

This one is the trans fattiest:
Jack in the Box


How about saturated fat?

The Best
Dairy Queen (0.018g saturated fat/gram of fries)

The Worst
Arby&#39;s (0.037g saturated fat/gram of fries)


Also remember that a good deal in dollars, doesn&#39;t translate to your diet, and a &quot;large fries&quot; means something different to everyone: 

Large Fries Serving Sizes 
McDonald&#39;s: 154g
Carl&#39;s Jr.: 184g
Wendy&#39;s: 184g
Dairy Queen: 186g
Arby&#39;s: 190g
Burger King: 194g
Jack in the Box: 236g&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Culver&#39;s fries are also okay, but I have never heard of Carl&#39;s Jr or Jack in the Box.</description>
