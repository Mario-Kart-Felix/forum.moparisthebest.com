    <title>Command Help (Resolved, Thanks To Everyone!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/command-help-resolved-thanks-to-everyone/533693</link>
    <description>I envision this idea that I&#39;ve researched for awhile and I know I&#39;ve heard of it before, I just can&#39;t find he right thing. I attempted to write it out on my own but I&#39;ve been at it for awhile with multiple errors. I want players to be able to, once they reach kills counts of 100, 250, and 500, be able to spawn the &quot;100, 250, 500 Kill Wings&quot; with a command such as ::100kills, ::250kills, etc... 

[code]if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;250kills&quot;)) {
				if (c.KC &gt; 250)
				c.sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations on your 250th kill!&quot;);
				c.getItems().addItem(1, 15051);

			}
[/code]

This is the rough base of the command that I trimmed everything off of. Don&#39;t spoon feed me, suggestions and learning are what I&#39;m here for.</description>

<p>This is what I have going so far, tried multiple methods, but this current one gives the correct message, item, etc… Except that you can spawn the wings before 100kills<br>

<p>Your code would have to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("100kills")) {
if (c.killCount &gt;= 100) {
c.sendMessage("Congratulations on your 100th kill!");
c.getItems().addItem(itemId, amount);
} else {
c.sendMessage("You need at least 100 kills to use this command!");
return;
}</code></pre>
<p>As for the variable killCount, you will need to make sure the variable is being declared and initialized properly; for example, you need to make sure that you find the NPC death method and set the variable to increase (c.killCount++) every time an NPC is killed, so the variable is being stored. You need to also make sure you are saving the variable’s value to the player file so that it can be initialized back into the previous value as before once the server is restarted.</p>
<p>Edit: If you have done the following, I can only suggest you check the control flow of your if-statement, because if it isn’t being done properly it might not check for that variable’s value until AFTER the command has been executed, which sounds highly improbable due to the example you provided, but it is the only thing I can consider a possibility.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ok it’s finally working exactly how I imagined it, thank you Tutorial!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Yeah I had that issue with blocks when I added it, but I found the method I prefer most now thanks to Tutorial. Btw, you need to quit your job and break up with your girlfriend so you can play OldSchool more.</p>
<p>OT: Thanks again Tutorial, Sk8r, Null Amount, Docent, Vain_, Amirparvis, and Strucker (not really though). You all worked awesomely in trying to resolve this with me and I appreciate it!</p>

<p>This, the item has no stats. I’m thinking of trying to implement it as to where you automatically get the item at your 250th kill, or make it obtainable from a shop and only be able to wear at 250 kills. Considering ideas at the moment. [/quote]<br>
If the item has no stats, and you can get it as much as you like, why would you care to automatically give it to the player?<br>
Just add it in the section that gives the player the +1 point for kills…<br>
Only issue is it’d give it to you every kill after, unless you did if(c.KC == 250)…</p>

Thanks for the advice, I’ve implemented it to my current version. For some reason it gives me a full inventory of toolkits now, with no message. Lol Wut?<br>
[/quote]I believe the parameters for the addItem method is itemId, amount, not amount, itemId. You should also rename your variables so it follows naming conventions (camelCase).[/quote][quote=“Docent, post:8, topic:533693”]I know why it gives you a full inv of toolkits…</p>
<p>replace [code=java]if (playerCommand.startsWith(“250kills”)) {<br>
