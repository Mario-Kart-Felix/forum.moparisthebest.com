    <title>Need help with pking timer and attacktimer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-pking-timer-and-attacktimer/260372</link>
    <description>whats on?
my attack timer doesnt work, also pking timer.

compiler errors?
no.

ok, im asking for help because i really couldnt fix it.
its like my attack timer or my pking timer are wrong.
it doesnt realy work, i mean, the timer work, but you can just click before the timer ends and attack.
in my server my weapons are all in client and with attackdelay and pkingdelay, my timers. About the weapon codes, they&#39;re not wrong, i set attack timer 10 and pking delay 10 at max.
it suppose to make the attack timer and pking delay a bit of..slow.
that happens, but not as it shoulded.
the timer can be interrupted if u click again at enemy, wich means it just doesnt matters.
i also tryied to put 8000 timer and pking delay, but it just glitched at my food and stuff.
so i beg, please for help.
i think theres something wrong with the own code, attack timer and pking delay.
can someone please post a correct code wich works about the delay of the weapons?i mean, a attack timer code or pkingdelay code, anything who works...
thanks, rah.
