    <description>Well, simple as this, I want to see what everyone can do with the provided base model of a scythe i had made. Its not a contest, but I think it would be cool if all the models made would be compiled into one folder. And if anyone is wondering, I do have permission to do this. And you can do whatever you want to the model. So good luck, have fun :D
