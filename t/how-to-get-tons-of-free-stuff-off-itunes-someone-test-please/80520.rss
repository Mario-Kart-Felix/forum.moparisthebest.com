    <title>How to get tons of free stuff off iTunes (Someone test please)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-tons-of-free-stuff-off-itunes-someone-test-please/80520</link>
    <description>Ok, I did this and it worked for me, but I&#39;m not sure if it works for anyone else.

1. Go to a local grocery store/bank and buy a $25 visa or mastercard gift card.
2. Create a paypal account at www.paypal.com
3. Use that gift card you just bought as your credit card on your paypal account.
4. Go and spend all your money on the giftcard somewhere else.
[u][b]**IMPORTANT**[/b][/u] Leave atleast 1 cent on your gift card! If you spend every last cent it will deny it no matter what...
5. Now go in your account in iTunes and choose Paypal as your payment option.
6. Follow the steps until you&#39;re finished changing your payment option.
[u][b]**NOTE**[/b][/u] Check your e-mail when you&#39;re done with step 6, if it has an e-mail telling you that you made a billing agreement, then you did it right.
7. Now go buy stuff in iTunes. With me I just bought movies and tv shows and it let me download them all.

[i][b]Notes:[/b][/i]
You might need a shopping cart, but I&#39;m not sure. I had a shopping cart and it worked.
I think you&#39;re paypal account can&#39;t be verified and NO BANK ACCOUNT!
If you have a bank account it will just subtract money from there.</description>

              <p>then why can you download off of limewire or kazaa or or torrents, and they don’t come to your house and steal your computer for piracy and crap huh??? it doesn’t make any sense and they can’t trace a file from someones computer to a website then to a webhost to a computer…it’s too much work and i would cost them millions of dollars to get maybe 100 people when they won’t even win back 10 million from all the cases…its just not happening…</p>

              <p>You can download it off of itunes, save it to a flash drive, take the flash drive to another computer and upload it to a file hosting site, like:<br>
-<a href="http://easy-share.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://easy-share.com</a><br>
-<a href="http://rapidshare.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://rapidshare.com</a><br>
-<a href="http://megaupload.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://megaupload.com</a></p>
<p>Then send us the link so we can get free music etc.</p>
<p>Files I’d like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tetris</li>
<li>Jackass (1 or 2 doesn’t matter)</li>
</ul>

              <p>Ok, I did this and it worked for me, but I’m not sure if it works for anyone else.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to a local grocery store/bank and buy a $25 visa or mastercard gift card.</li>
<li>Create a paypal account at <a href="http://www.paypal.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.paypal.com</a>
</li>
<li>Use that gift card you just bought as your credit card on your paypal account.</li>
<li>Go and spend all your money on the giftcard somewhere else.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></span></span> Leave atleast 1 cent on your gift card! If you spend every last cent it will deny it no matter what…</li>
<li>Now go in your account in iTunes and choose Paypal as your payment option.</li>
<li>Follow the steps until you’re finished changing your payment option.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"><strong>NOTE</strong></span></span> Check your e-mail when you’re done with step 6, if it has an e-mail telling you that you made a billing agreement, then you did it right.</li>
<li>Now go buy stuff in iTunes. With me I just bought movies and tv shows and it let me download them all.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Notes:</span></span><br>
You might need a shopping cart, but I’m not sure. I had a shopping cart and it worked.<br>
I think you’re paypal account can’t be verified and NO BANK ACCOUNT!<br>
If you have a bank account it will just subtract money from there.</p>
