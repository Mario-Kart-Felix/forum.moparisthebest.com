    <description>                                            [size=25pt]-SabiaScape Official-[/size]



                      [b]This server is coded by Sabia(Jake), and Martin(my irl friend). It is runned and maintained by Martin and I. [/b]



 [size=10pt][b]Minigames[/b][/size]

 Mini Games have been coded to turn out perfect inside this game. We are making and trying to make our Mini Games playable and enjoyable for [b]All[/b] levels, in most server higher levels get the most advantage on minigames, we are trying very hard to make our Mini games enjoyable for all levels.

 Here are some pictures of the minigames we have so far.
[u]
- Duel Arena[/u] - 100%
All rules working perfect, correct interface, correct timers and most of all correct staking. All working 100%.

Picture

- [u]Fight Pits[/u] - 100%
Fight pits works perfectly timers,rewards,champions best one out there.

- [u]Pest Control[/u] - 100%
Our pest control is not like any pest control its close to almost perfect as runescape. All the npc&#39;s have the correct attack emotes, They don&#39;t noclip or clipping from each other all work perfect and interfaces with work the same it shows portals hp, time left, void knight hp, rewards work also.

[size=10pt][b]Pking(Player Killing)[/b][/size]

Okay this is where we get serious, watching runescape pk vids all day trying to get correct timers was worth it. Okay so most server say there pking is perfect well yeah just like &#39;DeltaScape&#39;. I don&#39;t play private server that much put I know that the number 1 private server are shit and dirty. Economy ruined and much more. They attract players with their custom items and how high you can hit. Unlike most server SabiaScape will not have shity custom items I find them pointless. They ruin servers.


[b]PKing Features[/b]

[u]Melee[/u]

- Special Attacks - 100%
* Every special attack is close to runescape and 100% better than any server out there. [u]NOTE: This server has been based of Shards not Delta!.[/u]

- Hit formulas - 100% 
* After searching and researching over 20 commonly uses max hit formulas and studying their minor variables we have found the median of them all to come together with what is thought to be the most accurate damage calculator known to RuneScape servers.

- Bonus - 100%
*Our bonus have been searched in google.com, I found correct bonus for each weapons that means weapons don&#39;t have 9999 strenght bonus on them. So you wont be hitting 80&#39;s on this server.
[u]
Range
[/u]

- Projectiles - 100%
* Well the most important method in range is their projectiles and timers, unlike most server in this server all range weapons have correct projectiles and timers and they all hit the same as runescape.

-Special Attacks - 100%
* The special attacks are well coded and have a very well hit formula.

-Range Armour - 100%
*Every item related to range has been updated and have the correct bonuses and defense bonuses.

[u]Mage[/u]

- Spells - 100%
*All mage spells work perfectly in all mage books as in Modern,Ancient, and Lunars. Yes Lunars magic works perfect all the spells will be working soon with ther correct meaning.

- Projectiles - 100%
*The coolest thing about mage is their projectiles their diffrent colors and without projectiles mage will be useless :)

- Requirements - 100%
* As magic is seen as the weakest skill in the Combat triangle (Melee, Range, Magic) we have spiced it up a bit, Increasing Magic armor bonus&#39;s to hit a little harder, and be a little more effective, only to even up the score for those who wish to be pure mages or use it as a more effective combat tactic.
[u]
Skills
[/u]

I find skills the most important on any servers. Without skills servers will get boring really quick. That is why Martin and I have coded all the skills from scratch we don&#39;t copy skills from crappy tutorials on any forums.

Fishing - 100%
The fishing in SabiaScape is probably the best fishing in any server. There ALL fish, catching multiple fish from one spot (etc. tuna/swordfish). Fishing speed is adjusted due to which fish you are fishing for, and your fishing level!

Cooking - 100%
This skill (Unlike other servers) Has its burn rate formula more realistic to RS. If you are wearing a cooking cape (100 cooking) and cooking gauntlets, you will rarely burn Manta Rays. Burning is based on mostly cooking level. But we have also endured to make this our first &#39;Full&#39; skill, no skill on ANY server has EVER had a full skill, with EVERY cook able food, with the exact ingredients as RuneScape

Woodcutting - 100%
The woodcutting in SabiaScape is awesome, there are all types logs, you can cut trees from any angles, dragon axe works with the correct cut emote. The time it takes to cut a log is based off the tree you are cutting, the axe you are wielding, and your woodcutting level.

All the skills work perfect! By perfect I mean perfect almost as close to runescape. You will have to wait in till the server is in beta testing to see what I mean!

[size=10pt][b]Boss Monsters[/b][/size]

 All the bosses on the server have been added and working perfect as runescape. With correct hp defense bonuses and max hits, you must have a team to kill a boss. Bosses are meant to be killed with a team.

Chaos Element - 100%
The Chaos Elemental has 4 different attacks, doesn&#39;t hit 0 if you are using mage protect(halves the damage)
Melee attack(1):
1.The Chaos Elemental does one melee attack if you are close to him, a
body ram.

Mage attack(3):
1. A regular attack with a projectile.
2. An attack that removes a random piece of equipment.
3. An attack that eletricutes you, which makes you stop combat.(Instead of bullshit annoying teleporting)

King Black Dragon - 100%
The king black dragon has 6 different attacks.
It is very highly advised to use an anti-dragon shield or dragon fire shield (Fully charged) along with magic protect and an anti-fire potion if your going to melee, an anti-fire potion, and constantly use magic protect if you choose to use a ranging weapon.

Melee attack(2):
1. The king black dragon can attack you with his claws, hitting less than a headbutt.
2. The king black dragon can do a very powerful headbutt.

Mage attack(4):
1. The first attack, is his fire breath. This attack allows the king black to potentially deal extra damage.
2. The second attack of the king black dragon, is a poisonous breath.
3. The third attack of the king black dragon, It&#39;s Ice breath, has the potential to deal moderate damage while freezing you in place
4. The fourth attack, is a stat-lowering breath.


Kalphite Queen - 100%
The kalphite queen is a special boss, as it has the potential to attack everybody around her at once. The Kalphite queen is the strongest boss, as it deals high amounts of damage to everybody close to her in one attack. The kalphite queen has 1 magic attack, 1 ranging attack, and 2 melee attacks.

Melee(2):
1. The kalphite queen can bite a single person, with venomous teeth.
2. The kalphite queen can kick a single person, thus it&#39;s weakest attack with no effects.

Range(1);
1. The kalphite queen ranging attack fling&#39;s spike&#39;s at everybody near the kalphite queen, causing massive damage.

Magic(1):
1. The kalphite queen has a very unique magic spell, which hits one player, causing a chain reaction and forces the spell to hit the next player and so on.


Daggonath Kings - 100%
The dagannoth king&#39;s are fairly special, as there is three of them, and little bitches in the water. There is one king that uses range attacks, one king that uses magic attacks, and one king that melee attacks.

Magic attack(1):
1. The dagannoth supreme uses a magic attack, that is very powerful.

Range attack():
1. The dagannoth prime uses a ranging attack, shooting a spike from its back at you.

Melee attack(1):
1. The dagannoth rex uses a poisonous claw to strike.

[size=13pt][b]The Server In Detail[/b][/size]

 In this server stability is perfect I can run this server 24/7 without any lagg with over 200 players online. I don&#39;t have to test it I know it by a fact as our process is perfect thanks to graham our client.java is only 58kb. The stability I cant explain its perfect no crashing. We have our own anti ddos and agf bot is nothing.

Leveling is not going to be fast or slow that means you wont be getting a skillcape in a day. I believe in leveling to be perfect as it will keep players to keep on playing. Unlike other servers. When your going to go pking you will see a bunch of diffrent levels not only 90-126. Items such as whip will be hard to get so welcome old runescape pking with dragon scimitars and dds :). Pking has no rules. You can pj,1 item pk, anything unless you x logg put we have anti x logg so gl. This server will have a website with a webclient and a down loadable client if you want to download it and may have problems with webclient. Forums will be active when the server is going to be turned on for beta testing. This saturday.

<p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Pking(Player Killing)</span>[/size]</p>
<p>Okay this is where we get serious, watching runescape pk vids all day trying to get correct timers was worth it. Okay so most server say there pking is perfect well yeah just like ‘DeltaScape’. I don’t play private server that much put I know that the number 1 private server are shit and dirty. Economy ruined and much more. They attract players with their custom items and how high you can hit. Unlike most server SabiaScape will not have shity custom items I find them pointless. They ruin servers.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PKing Features</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Melee</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Special Attacks - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Every special attack is close to runescape and 100% better than any server out there. <span class="bbcode-u">NOTE: This server has been based of Shards not Delta!.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hit formulas - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After searching and researching over 20 commonly uses max hit formulas and studying their minor variables we have found the median of them all to come together with what is thought to be the most accurate damage calculator known to RuneScape servers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bonus - 100%<br>
*Our bonus have been searched in <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>, I found correct bonus for each weapons that means weapons don’t have 9999 strenght bonus on them. So you wont be hitting 80’s on this server.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><br>
Range<br>
</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projectiles - 100%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Well the most important method in range is their projectiles and timers, unlike most server in this server all range weapons have correct projectiles and timers and they all hit the same as runescape.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Special Attacks - 100%</p>
<ul>
<li>The special attacks are well coded and have a very well hit formula.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Range Armour - 100%<br>
*Every item related to range has been updated and have the correct bonuses and defense bonuses.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Mage</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spells - 100%<br>
*All mage spells work perfectly in all mage books as in Modern,Ancient, and Lunars. Yes Lunars magic works perfect all the spells will be working soon with ther correct meaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projectiles - 100%<br>
*The coolest thing about mage is their projectiles their diffrent colors and without projectiles mage will be useless <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirements - 100%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As magic is seen as the weakest skill in the Combat triangle (Melee, Range, Magic) we have spiced it up a bit, Increasing Magic armor bonus’s to hit a little harder, and be a little more effective, only to even up the score for those who wish to be pure mages or use it as a more effective combat tactic.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><br>
Skills<br>
</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I find skills the most important on any servers. Without skills servers will get boring really quick. That is why Martin and I have coded all the skills from scratch we don’t copy skills from crappy tutorials on any forums.</p>
<p>Fishing - 100%<br>
The fishing in SabiaScape is probably the best fishing in any server. There ALL fish, catching multiple fish from one spot (etc. tuna/swordfish). Fishing speed is adjusted due to which fish you are fishing for, and your fishing level!</p>
<p>Cooking - 100%<br>
This skill (Unlike other servers) Has its burn rate formula more realistic to RS. If you are wearing a cooking cape (100 cooking) and cooking gauntlets, you will rarely burn Manta Rays. Burning is based on mostly cooking level. But we have also endured to make this our first ‘Full’ skill, no skill on ANY server has EVER had a full skill, with EVERY cook able food, with the exact ingredients as RuneScape</p>
<p>Woodcutting - 100%<br>
The woodcutting in SabiaScape is awesome, there are all types logs, you can cut trees from any angles, dragon axe works with the correct cut emote. The time it takes to cut a log is based off the tree you are cutting, the axe you are wielding, and your woodcutting level.</p>
<p>All the skills work perfect! By perfect I mean perfect almost as close to runescape. You will have to wait in till the server is in beta testing to see what I mean!</p>
<p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Boss Monsters</span>[/size]</p>
<p>All the bosses on the server have been added and working perfect as runescape. With correct hp defense bonuses and max hits, you must have a team to kill a boss. Bosses are meant to be killed with a team.</p>
<p>Chaos Element - 100%<br>
The Chaos Elemental has 4 different attacks, doesn’t hit 0 if you are using mage protect(halves the damage)<br>
Melee attack(1):<br>
1.The Chaos Elemental does one melee attack if you are close to him, a<br>
body ram.</p>
<p>Mage attack(3):</p>
<ol>
<li>A regular attack with a projectile.</li>
<li>An attack that removes a random piece of equipment.</li>
<li>An attack that eletricutes you, which makes you stop combat.(Instead of bullshit annoying teleporting)</li>
</ol>
<p>King Black Dragon - 100%<br>
The king black dragon has 6 different attacks.<br>
It is very highly advised to use an anti-dragon shield or dragon fire shield (Fully charged) along with magic protect and an anti-fire potion if your going to melee, an anti-fire potion, and constantly use magic protect if you choose to use a ranging weapon.</p>
<p>Melee attack(2):</p>
<ol>
<li>The king black dragon can attack you with his claws, hitting less than a headbutt.</li>
<li>The king black dragon can do a very powerful headbutt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mage attack(4):</p>
<ol>
<li>The first attack, is his fire breath. This attack allows the king black to potentially deal extra damage.</li>
<li>The second attack of the king black dragon, is a poisonous breath.</li>
<li>The third attack of the king black dragon, It’s Ice breath, has the potential to deal moderate damage while freezing you in place</li>
<li>The fourth attack, is a stat-lowering breath.</li>
</ol>
<p>Kalphite Queen - 100%<br>
The kalphite queen is a special boss, as it has the potential to attack everybody around her at once. The Kalphite queen is the strongest boss, as it deals high amounts of damage to everybody close to her in one attack. The kalphite queen has 1 magic attack, 1 ranging attack, and 2 melee attacks.</p>
<p>Melee(2):</p>
<ol>
<li>The kalphite queen can bite a single person, with venomous teeth.</li>
<li>The kalphite queen can kick a single person, thus it’s weakest attack with no effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Range(1);</p>
<ol>
<li>The kalphite queen ranging attack fling’s spike’s at everybody near the kalphite queen, causing massive damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Magic(1):</p>
<ol>
<li>The kalphite queen has a very unique magic spell, which hits one player, causing a chain reaction and forces the spell to hit the next player and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Daggonath Kings - 100%<br>
The dagannoth king’s are fairly special, as there is three of them, and little bitches in the water. There is one king that uses range attacks, one king that uses magic attacks, and one king that melee attacks.</p>
<p>Magic attack(1):</p>
<ol>
<li>The dagannoth supreme uses a magic attack, that is very powerful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Range attack():</p>
<ol>
<li>The dagannoth prime uses a ranging attack, shooting a spike from its back at you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Melee attack(1):</p>
<ol>
<li>The dagannoth rex uses a poisonous claw to strike.</li>
</ol>

<p>[size=13pt]<span class="bbcode-b">The Server In Detail</span>[/size]</p>
<p>In this server stability is perfect I can run this server 24/7 without any lagg with over 200 players online. I don’t have to test it I know it by a fact as our process is perfect thanks to graham our client.java is only 58kb. The stability I cant explain its perfect no crashing. We have our own anti ddos and agf bot is nothing.</p>
<p>Leveling is not going to be fast or slow that means you wont be getting a skillcape in a day. I believe in leveling to be perfect as it will keep players to keep on playing. Unlike other servers. When your going to go pking you will see a bunch of diffrent levels not only 90-126. Items such as whip will be hard to get so welcome old runescape pking with dragon scimitars and dds :). Pking has no rules. You can pj,1 item pk, anything unless you x logg put we have anti x logg so gl. This server will have a website with a webclient and a down loadable client if you want to download it and may have problems with webclient. Forums will be active when the server is going to be turned on for beta testing. This saturday.</p>
