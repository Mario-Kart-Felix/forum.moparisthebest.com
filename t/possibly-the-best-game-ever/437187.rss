    <title>Possibly the best game ever?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/possibly-the-best-game-ever/437187</link>
    <description>Was watching some videos on a game called Facade, what happens is that one guy named &quot;Trip&quot; invites you over to a little party in his apartment with his wife. You go over to find that they have a failing marriage and spark into argument, but you can either play the game seriously or do what is more common (fuck around with them). 

Here&#39;s a video:

It&#39;s free and it&#39;s fun to screw around in.</description>
