[li]Create your character here, and log on and enjoy![/li][/ol]


2)[b] Server Info[/b]
We are the #1 Private RSC server that exists. Our code is the most bug-free, our combat systems the most accurate, and our staff the most active. Runescape Classic Revolution is the closest to a true classic experience that you can actively play (with a few improvements!).

While in the search for acquiring that nostalgic feeling, we came to understand a few things about what made RuneScape great and what made it worse. We have tried to cut out the bad aspects of the game and streamline the process. 

Experience Rates have been improved. But not too much! We cut the grind down as to make the game faster, but not outrageous.

[b]Combat (Att, Def, Str &amp; HP):[/b]
-Non-sub: 8x
-Subscriber: 9x
-Wilderness: + 1x

[b]Combat (Prayer, Magic, Range):[/b]
-Non-sub: 3x 
-Subscriber: 4x
-Wilderness: + 1x

[b]Skilling Rates:[/b]
Non-Sub: 2x
Subscriber: 3x

Here&#39;s a few things we do differently (better!):

[ul][li][b]Batched skilling:[/b]
As you level up, the more you can automate skills. At lvl 20 to 29, all skills automatically repeat themselves twice. 30 to 39, they repeat 3x. All the way up to 9x at 90![/li]
[li][/li]
[li][b]Global Chat:[/b]There is a global chat feature to always keep you feeling like you aren&#39;t alone training.[/li]
[li][/li]
[li][b]Bank:[/b] We have rebuilt the original bank interface and added lots of more features such as:[/li]
[li]Bank organizing, you can organize your bank however you wish inside the bank interface[/li]
[li]Bank notes: Goodbye the inability to carry large quantities of whatever! You can note every single item, which makes selling and buying that much quicker[/li]
[li][/li]

[li][b]Android Client:[/b] We have successfully ported a fully playable version of RuneScape client for android devices! [/li]
[li][/li]
[li][b]Party System:[/b] That&#39;s right, we cut down the grind even more. You can train with your friends while sharing the XP with party members in range[/li]
[li][/li]
[li][b]Auction House:[/b] Selling and Buying items made easy. Want to sell something? Put it on Auction House and just wait[/li][/ul]



3) [b]Game Commands[/b]

[ul][li]::1  -- This allows you to speak in global(general channel) (ex: ::say Hey is anyone selling bowstrings??)[/li]
[li]::2  -- This allows you to speak in global(PK channel) (ex: ::say Hey is anyone selling bowstrings??)[/li]
[li]::wildy -- This tells you the status of the wilderness. We rotate between F2P rules and P2P rules every two days in order to appeal to everyone&#39;s preferences. [/li]
[li]::online -- This tells you the number of players online.[/li]
[li]::onlinelist -- This lists those players so you know exactly who is on.[/li]
[li]::skull -- Puts a skull above your head. Useful for accepting a Death Match where both players want to be skulled.[/li]
[li]::fatigue -- Puts you at 100% fatigue so you stop gaining experience. Useful for those low level pkers who want to stay at a certain point.[/li][/ul]



4) [b]FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)[/b]

1) [i]Are all items and locations available for free? No members only?[/i]
a) Yes! There are no restrictions. Enjoy all the skills, items, and locations with or without being subbed!

2) [i]Subbed? What is a subscription?[/i]
a) A subscription is purely a donation. You gain no items and no levels.It is a $5 donation to help with server costs and the only benefit you gain is an added XP bonus. Instead of gaining 3x combat xp (3.5x if you are in the wilderness), you gain 4x combat xp (4.5x in wildy). With Skills XP, you gain 2.5x by being a subscriber, 2x without. It also allows you to remain in 1 spot for 10 minutes as compared to 5 minutes of not moving.

3) [i]Can I bot here?[/i]
a) NO! We have a reputation as being the most anti-bot friendly server out there. We want our players to have a community of real people, not a cesspool of automated botters. We crack down on all bot users by actively monitoring players and having our own private detection methods (no spyware or secret files are put on your computer, it is all server side). You may get away with botting for a brief time, but we will always catch and ban you eventually.

4)[i] How do I make money when I first begin?[/i]

a) There are a few ways people make money to start with. Probably the quickest way is to spin flax  ( http://runescapeclassic.wikia.com/wiki/Flax ) into bowstrings and sell them. If that is too far away, Balls of Wool are sellable as well. Shear the sheep in Lumbridge, spin the balls in the top of the castle, and walk to Draynor to bank.
There are many ways to earn money, don&#39;t be scared to ask for help in global for more information.

All other questions, comments, concerns not addressed in this post can be answered through the forums or in-game. Don&#39;t hesitate to ask!

We hope you enjoy your stay! Welcome to RuneScape Classic Revolution!</description>

              <p>[quote=“RSCRevolution, post:179, topic:542399”]Hello,<br>
I have a new experimental update for you, which is live right now.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Hotspots:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">You must be in party to get the hotspot benefits</span></p>
<p>Every two hours a hotspot in wilderness is randomly picked, if you go into this area in party you and your party members in that area will start <span class="bbcode-b">receiving 150% more experience</span> and <span class="bbcode-b">double amount of stackable drops(coins, runes, and so on)</span>.<br>
Once another party enters to hotspot in your control, you will lose control of it and lose your benefits. So this is kind of team-based “king of the hill”, in original RSC wilderness!</p>
<p>The <span class="bbcode-b">wilderness levels are ignored</span> and<span class="bbcode-b"> you can attack any level character who is in a party in that area</span>, except your own party members.</p>
<p>At start only the most useful areas of wilderness will be the hotspots, such as:<br>
Castle,<br>
Graveyard,<br>
End wild dungeon.<br>
more…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">You can view who’s party is currently controlling hotspot and where it is by command<br>
::hotspot</span></p>
<p>I have decided to release the Revenants as an addition to the <a href="http://www.rscrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?id=6064" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Wilderness Hotspots</a> update.<br>
<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/ef38abe0181df953b222fe175f13153e.png" alt width="419" height="390"><br>
You can find them slaying npcs at the current hot-spot, <span class="bbcode-b">they are harmless until you do damage to it</span> and if you happen to make damage to him, he will remember that for the next 5 minutes or until he’s dead. Once you’ve been targeted by Revenant, other npcs will not attack you as long as you are in hotspot area, if you don’t attack revenant for 5 minutes in anyway or revenant dies, other npcs will become aggressive again.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">You must be in a party before you can attack them!</span><br>
They are very tough and you will need good gear and several friends in your party before you can defeat him and when you do, you are rewarded with loot from 4 different loot tables at same time.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Loot tables:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://i.gyazo.com/a27537d68a1c1d78d780927fa35fd4e7.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Runes, guaranteed drops of each rune, only the amounts change</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://i.gyazo.com/763a3c6bea2858f160ed9736f83e785d.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Gear, from rune to dragon medium. Most items are in noted form </a></li>
<li><a href="https://i.gyazo.com/763a3c6bea2858f160ed9736f83e785d.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Gear, from rune to dragon medium. Most items are in noted form </a></li>
<li>Food and potions. Most items are in noted form</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Notice: </span>Paralyze Monster won’t block his hits completely, but it will take 50 percent off from his damage.</p>
<p>Have fun playing!<br>

<p>or ignore someone that wants to play… thats cool too</p>

<p>I have played some servers on and off, but this one is pretty sweet. I spend most of my time playing on my laptop, but I can also play it on my android when I am on the road or at work. Great community, no complaints aside from a certain person or two that may get annoying in global, but I’ve added them to my ignore list. Overall, great server.</p>
