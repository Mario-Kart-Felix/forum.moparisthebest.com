    <description>So I&#39;ve been here before, but I got annoyed and left because I didn&#39;t understand anything about it. All I knew how to do was leech and host servers. So I was wondering what types of coding go into making an actual runescape server. I&#39;m interested in the (317) style ones. Specifically I want to know ALL types of coding used in making your own server, and ALL types of coding used in making your own client.

<p>Thanks for the reply. But I was wondering, do you have to use a different coding when making a client? Like when you start a client for the .cmd to run everything?</p>

How do people customize a client to go along with their own server then?[/quote]</p>
<p>it is called modifying open-source code</p>
