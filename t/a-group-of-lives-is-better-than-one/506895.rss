    <title>A group of lives is better than one</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-group-of-lives-is-better-than-one/506895</link>
    <description>A group of peoples lives are in danger, a train is speeding towards them not slowing down. You have a choice, push the person in front of you onto the train track making the train come to a screeching halt saving the group of people down the track or don&#39;t push the person in front of you and let the group of people die.

My question is, is it ethically right to take a life to save more. I mean if you think about it, murder is murder and you&#39;re killing someone who has their own life, who has their own family and friends. If you think about it a group of lives to save is better than one but when it boils down to murder, is it right or wrong? I mean if it&#39;s within the law how would you explain it to the victims family? Who knows, maybe the person you just killed was planning on proposing that night, or maybe taking their kid to their sons first baseball game. All these things should rush through your head when deciding and I believe you just wont have the will power to do that, to kill someone using your hands.

As a summary, will you kill one person to save the lives of more people and is it right?

Btw, did you think of throwing yourself in front of the train?</description>

Death isn’t feared because of the things you will lose, it is feared because people have yet to experience it and anything unknown to people is intimidating.</p>
<p>Even people with nothing in life can fear death, as people who have a lot may not. It depends on whether you find it intimating, if you are at peace or you accept the fact you are going to die, then you don’t fear it.<br>

I’ve noticed in your recent posts (tell me if this is just me thinking this) that you are fixated on only what you can conjure up, by that I mean your belief is only what you believe, it sounds like you’re not taking under consideration that anything else can be a possibility (remember correct me if I see it incorrectly).

This is very possible, but i think everyone’s belief is what they believe. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Everything is possible, i was being silly and generalising based on my experiences.</p>
<p>I don’t think that every question doesn’t have an answer, i believe there is but you’ve yet to discover it.</p>

Some people may fear it because it’s a 1-way route and there’s no way back. So when you have things you love (girlfriends, friend(s), family, passion/hobby), death would seem like a harsh thing.</p>
<p>If you have nothing in life that makes you want to stay in life, then death would seem like nothing to be afraid of.</p>

<p>I disagree, I think not existing is scary.  And death is a big deal to me, because there is no telling what things are like after you’re dead.[/quote]<br>
I should have stated that part was just my opinion on it, sorry about that (that wasn’t a sarcastic statement).</p>
<p>What’s scary about not existing? Is it because you can’t imagine it, is it because you want to protect people, is it because you will miss the distractions that distract us our whole lives; what is the reason;o?</p>
<p>I agree death is a big deal, I just said it shouldn’t be a big deal (I’m not saying don’t mourn the dead ofc) as it just means you won’t feel pain and suffering anymore but of course this means you won’t feel happiness and joy anymore. It’s all just chemical reactions and so on so to me superficially all of these emotions are important but in reality they seem to be pretty pointless if you agree that life doesn’t hold much positive value.<br>
I can’t honestly say I remember a day in my life that held much value (that was down to me, not down to others companies), can you?</p>

<p>I would take my life, yes. I wouldn’t dedicate my life for others though. Not existing isn’t a scary thought so death shouldn’t be a big deal exl. the pain of dying which is pretty damn scary; living and working/w.e. is a real commitment etc, you have to continue doing it whereas death most probably leads to no feeling, pain and so on.</p>

<p>I don’t think I would be able to kill a six year old boy, but if I only had a few seconds to decide I would probably push him in front of the train.  Unless of course I knew the boy.  If he was my brother, or cousin or someone I would definitely not save the group.</p>

              <p>Like Jc was implying, the more variables in the question, the harder it is to answer…</p>
<p>The mathematical backbone of the question is<br>
“5 die or 1 dies, which do you choose?”</p>
<p>I think everyone can agree you’d pick the 1 in this scenario. But then you start to add more variables…<br>
“5 die or you kill 1, which do you choose?”</p>
<p>It’s suddenly a much more complex and morality based question. A lot of people would just flat out refuse to kill anyone, no matter how many others would die. Some would ask if the 1 was elderly (and/or willing to die), or if the 5 were children or females.</p>
<p>So let’s take it a step further.</p>
<p>2 children, one pregnant mother, a baby, and Osama bin laden die in a train crash, or you have to kill a 6 year old boy (saving the other 5). Or what if both were going to die, and you got to pick one group to save (the boy or the other 5)?</p>
