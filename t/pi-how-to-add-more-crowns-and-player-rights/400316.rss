    <description>How to add more playerrights and more crowns.

Difficulty 5/10

lets start in the 
[code]client.java[/code]
client sided:

now I wont be showing all the code cause it takes awhile I will add all the code in eventually atm I dont have much time.

first in client.java search for
[code]modicon
cr0
and pushmessage[/code]
okay what modeicon does after you search that add the new case for every modicon place(each case is a new player right) you change it to the new modicon you aded so lets say you added
[code]case 7:
modeicon[7].drawSprite(xPos, yPos - 12);
xPos += 14;
break;[/code]

it mean that modicon7 is goign to be cr7 and also used for playerrights 7.

now for
[code]pushmessage[/code]
push message is what shows the crown when you talk for whisper clan talk and regular :S an exzample would be this:
[code]if(myPrivilege == 7) {
pushMessage(myPlayer.textSpoken, 2, &quot;@cr7@&quot; + myPlayer.name);[/code]
same dealo of what the code does but it shows the crown when that player talks. MAKE sure to replace ll code like this the other pushmessage codes in client.java leave alone.

double check you changed all the pushmessage by searching for 
[code]cr0[/code] 
and adding your new rights like you did up there ^ 
its pretty much all copy and paste will take me forever to take every single line and put it in a tut you get the general idea though
now find your sprites and find where your modicons picture is make a new crown ad label is modicons 7 all caps.


thats if for client sided.

now for server sided go to commands youll see something like this
[code]    if (c.playerRights &gt;= 0)
        playerCommands(c, playerCommand);
    if (c.playerRights == 5 || c.playerRights == 6 || c.playerRights == 3) 
        moderatorCommands(c, playerCommand);
    if (c.playerRights == 6 || c.playerRights == 3) 
        administratorCommands(c, playerCommand);
    if (c.playerRights == 3) 
        ownerCommands(c, playerCommand);
        DonatorCommands(c, playerCommand);
        if (c.playerRights == 4) 
        DonatorCommands(c, playerCommand);
            if (c.playerRights == 5) 
        moderatorCommands(c, playerCommand);
    }[/code]
add your player rights to whichever sort of priverlage you want to give them than add a command that is sort like this

[code]			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;giveadmin&quot;)) {
				try {	
					String playerToAdmin = playerCommand.substring(10);
					for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
						if(Server.playerHandler.players[i] != null) {
							if(Server.playerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToAdmin)) {
								Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[i];
								c2.sendMessage(&quot;You have been given admin status by &quot; + c.playerName);
								c2.playerRights = 7;
								c2.logout();
								break;
							} 
						}
					}[/code]
change the send message and c2.playerrights and command.starts with with whatever you like
for me number 7 is the admin so i made the command name giveadmin
and to give the right player rights your working with this
[code]c2.playerRights = 7;[/code]

that is how you add a new crown attached to different player rights. when I have more time I will update this.</description>

add your player rights to whichever sort of priverlage you want to give them than add a command that is sort like this</p>
<p><code>			if (playerCommand.startsWith("giveadmin")) {
				try {

								c2.sendMessage("You have been given admin status by " + c.playerName);
								c2.playerRights = 7;
								c2.logout();
								break;
							} 
						}
					}</code><br>
change the send message and c2.playerrights and command.starts with with whatever you like<br>
for me number 7 is the admin so i made the command name giveadmin<br>
and to give the right player rights your working with this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>that is how you add a new crown attached to different player rights. when I have more time I will update this.</p>
