    <title>World 17 (RS SOURCE!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/world-17-rs-source/167547</link>
    <description>The main post is after the line, in this part I&#39;ll just post for asking for things that I may need:

[b]I am currently looking for Server crashers, hacker w.e tools you may have got[/b]. (send through pm since the distribution is not allowed. and we don&#39;t want noobs going on a server crashing spree)

[b]Looking for people who will code the quests, people who know how to work with cut scenes [/b]

[hr]

Hey all ;D I&#39;m back.. I&#39;ve stopped working on my 459-470 sources simply because I got tired oh all the work (i may resume after this project).

I have noticed that sources now a days suck shit. Easily rapeable sources that are worthless. So I&#39;ve decided to make a source for all of you from scratch :) those who would like to join me are welcomed, leechers go finger yourselves before joining.


Here is a screen shot of what I have so far:

[img]http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/8761/newsourcebaseom2.png[/img]

The source will be 100% replica of rs when it was at version 317.
It will be a strong source with minimal lag, very clean coding, and properly written in a professional manner.

The source will be distributed once it&#39;s done. Everyone&#39;s contribution will be credited.</description>

              <p>My success does not depend on others. My goal is to create such source, not have people accept it. It is purely for educating and practicing purpose (as I am getting into a habbit of documenting each tiny bit and organization as well as java conventions (ex: constants being full caps, etc…). Once again others who want to use it can take advantage… those who don’t can continue and flame and spam but it doesn’t affect me, because I am getting to my goal.</p>
<p>I understand you are trying to make a point that it is useless, but to me it is not. Thanks for your interest and time in replying.</p>

              <p>you will /FAIL quite badly. as someone said in 1 of the earliest posts, this has been done before and it jsut got rejected, the point of moparscape is people making runescape how they like. If they wanted a server that was exactly like how rs was when it was on 317 cache they would jsut play rs, because jagex will most of the time beat any person on here in any type of codign they attempt to do.</p>

This may have been done before but what harm is he doing making a different version? He wants help, not people trying to put him off his project. Now I don’t know what your getting out of flaming him on this thread, mabye your trying to be funny? It’s making you look immature and stupid (Note: Also mabye some of you want to look immature? Don’t post here) Who gives a shit if you’ve done something like this before? He dosen’t unless your releasing it… Who cares if your project was a failure? He dosen’t, unless you tell him what he could do to prevent his bieng a failure. He wants to learn, and wants other people to learn too, this is how we all should be. Please keep your negative comments about me in private messages. And im sure he wouldn’t mind if you sent him your negative comments by private message either. God, what has happened on theese forums since I was last on? It’s stupid what you immature kids are doing here, imo it’s a big waste of time you even bieng here. Don’t post unless your encouraging him or helping him… Thanks.</p>

He has a valid point, “source developers,” or whatever you ejaculate to at night, have lost the true point and developmental value of what could have been. You advertise your server source as the best, and what do developers get? A bunch of half-assed code, with random, non-logical, object and non-player character placement. When you go to “write” your next line of code, ask yourself this. “Why am I making the player do this?” So much more can be done, in yet adding commands and changing names allow for the rights to release the pieces of shit many call work.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I lol’d, but it’s true. I spent a day flaming at people in the download section, nothing there is new ++ they all have the same old base.</p>
<p>Actually i just noticed that your going to make it like rs, exactly like it, i don’t see the point, when rs2 is much better coded than yours (If your making it like rs2) as well as graphics and whatever. People are better off playing runescape. Private servers are to get away from the reality(for some) that is runescape. Easier leveling, getting items quicker, faster. Without the hassle of all that bullshit pass tutorial island, walk across the whole god damn map to get a bucket of milk, when here you have commands, or portals, or whatever you might use.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well the goal doesn’t end there… It’s to make it like runescape so people can edit things from there on. Right now, 99% of the so called “servers” have 1 place where you can train, with more than half the source being about “commands”. With my release, skills can be trained throughout the world which other people will find useful when modifying the source. I know RS has been done and people want different things, but what I’m trying to get them back at is proper functionality.

[/quote]Woman, you shut the fuck up and listen. I have done this before. No one liked it. Why? Because if people want to play RS, they’ll go to <a href="http://runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runescape.com</a>. So you sit your bitch ass down and fucking give up now. There is no hope in such a stupid project. Fuck off.[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote=“Paintball199, post:18, topic:167547”]Quest rs, You fail. Im working on 453 server ( still need to figure out the packets. )<br>
and I dont think 450+ has a client.java. haxerownsmopar showed me his 422 Server Folder<br>
and he didnt had a client.java. If you make a 455+ server with a client.java i will<br>
give you a cookie.[/quote]</p>
<p>Stop flaming him. If Quest rs wants to build a server from scratch then he should do that. If you have nothing good to say then dont post.</p>

<p>Not sure to whom you’re referring, but I only wrote the source so people like quest rs can learn more about java and use a real abstract server base with a logical model.<br>
And before you critisize my code I implore you to look at it. Half-assed it may be, but there’s nothing random or non-logical about it.</p>

<p>I lol’d, but it’s true. I spent a day flaming at people in the download section, nothing there is new ++ they all have the same old base.</p>
<p>Actually i just noticed that your going to make it like rs, exactly like it, i don’t see the point, when rs2 is much better coded than yours (If your making it like rs2) as well as graphics and whatever. People are better off playing runescape. Private servers are to get away from the reality(for some) that is runescape. Easier leveling, getting items quicker, faster. Without the hassle of all that bullshit pass tutorial island, walk across the whole god damn map to get a bucket of milk, when here you have commands, or portals, or whatever you might use.</p>

              <p>Varek, I’m using my own source that I’ve been working on from scratch for a while now, though the only trouble I’ve had with it so far is the map loading. Last night I noticed you released your server, I may snoop around to see how you worked with things. And yes I know wL’s isn’t the best base there is…</p>
<p>I may reconsider on how far I will take this seeing as how I’ll be busy programing for my robotic’s team for the FIRST competitions. As of now I’m aiming at full source no matter how long it takes.</p>
<p>Edit: I think I’ll release 2 versions of this, one with wL’s as base and one with my base. And if you ever release your source when I get a chance to look at it carefully I may make it compatible to that also…</p>
<p>I’m hoping to have an active connection to all sources based on my releases for automatic update but have no idea on how to do that without having my ISP suspend my account ;D (like last year). You guys are the pros, give tips and suggestions as you may see them fit please… after all I’m still learning :).</p>
