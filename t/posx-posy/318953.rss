    <title>PosX PosY</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/posx-posy/318953</link>
    <description>having trouble getting the thing for PosX and PosY, I don&#39;t have a cord to be able to tell where I am standing at, I don&#39;t have a command for it and I don&#39;t have a Cord locator on my client, I want to make one in my Quest tab, but I don&#39;t have any idea how to make it. Please inform me on how to do so. Not asking for the full thing but if you can give me it that would be great aswell.

Thank you, Spades

PS using Delta base.

I have gotten this far but it doesn&#39;t update my cords when I walk, just the cords I was at when I logged on.
