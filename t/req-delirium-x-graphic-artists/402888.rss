Hello, My name is Cory and I&#39;m relatively new to the Moparscape community. I was unsure where to post this kind of thread so I searched for threads of the similar type and it led me to this board.

I am currently looking for a GFX artist for my new server. To apply fill out the following application.


[code]What is your name?
How old are you?
What programs do you use for graphics?
How long have you been doing graphics?
Can you post an example of your work? If not why?[/code]



I currently have 3 GFX artist spots open. I will not give staff in return for your GFX work but you will have a higher chance of getting staff. (This is because I need to get used to you and see how you work. Don&#39;t want people messing up my server.)

[b]A little background on my server.[/b]
We have paid webhosting + VPS and domains. A very unique look to our forums will give you the play ground you need to let your skills flourish. We have paid advertising so we will gain players and your work will not be put to waste.
