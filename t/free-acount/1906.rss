    <title>Free acount</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/free-acount/1906</link>
    <description>Like the topic eh? well ok i bought an acount off sythe and the guy recovered a week later. I got him banned off sythe and he came to me and said that his friend recovered it and he changed the pass and gave me back the acount. today the same thing happened except this time i told him that his friend recovered it and that i really needed it to get it to 76 fishing. After that he gave me the pass and now im trying to get it banned like theres no tommorow. i went to the majour trading places and used fagex&#39;s spammer. i think im muted but no luck other than that. He can easily recover the acount but im not sure how he does it. Heres the catch.give me a convincing way that you will be able to make the acount unrecoverable and its all yours. please note i will not giv it to leechers. and if nothing happens i will pm the details tonight to mopar and he can have it as a thanx.

heres the stats:

              <p>Heres the complete story. I saw an add for a guy that wanted to sell an acount on sythe. I agreed and when we got an mm the mm said that the answers to the recovery question which the scammer provided were wrong. The scammer said they  worked for him. i was all convinced so i bought the acount. about a week later the pass was changed. i told him and he said it was his friend who recovered it and he re-recovered and gave me the pass. But by then he was already IP banned offf sythe. A few days  later the pass changed again i knew it was obviously him. I was desperate to ban the acount so i told him that his friend recovered it again and asked him if he could recover it for me because i wanted to get it to 76 fishing. that day i got the fishing lvl from 73 to 74 through aryan however the acount wasnt banned. I went to <a href="http://fagex.net" rel="nofollow noopener">fagex.net</a> and got their spammer and used it (ill post the spammer in next post). i used it in most majour trade places and also in the catherby lob fishing area. so many people reported me it wasnt funny. after that i thought it was no use trying to get the acount banned so i just started getting flax. it got around 1500 flax and 486 lobs so i decided i want to sell. i went to world 2 and when i tried to log in it said your acount has been disabled please check your message center for details.i quickly went there and used up the apeal. in the apeal i confessed to the crime. Then on msn i told him that i knew he was scamming me all along and that i got the acount banned. He was away and he came on later after that this is what he said [QUOTE]ஐ◄███▓▒░░Sean Owens░░▒▓███►ஐ…I Love You Sooo Much Caitlin  XOXOXOXOXO You Are My WorldHappy Ten Months  says:<br>

              <p>Like the topic eh? well ok i bought an acount off sythe and the guy recovered a week later. I got him banned off sythe and he came to me and said that his friend recovered it and he changed the pass and gave me back the acount. today the same thing happened except this time i told him that his friend recovered it and that i really needed it to get it to 76 fishing. After that he gave me the pass and now im trying to get it banned like theres no tommorow. i went to the majour trading places and used fagex’s spammer. i think im muted but no luck other than that. He can easily recover the acount but im not sure how he does it. Heres the catch.give me a convincing way that you will be able to make the acount unrecoverable and its all yours. please note i will not giv it to leechers. and if nothing happens i will pm the details tonight to mopar and he can have it as a thanx.</p>
<p>heres the stats:<br>
