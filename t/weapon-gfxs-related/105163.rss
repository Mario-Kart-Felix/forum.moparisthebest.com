    <description>How do I make it so that an animation goes the right way if I attack a person?

E.g. I use a bow. A glowing arrow shoots out, but it always point south. So when I shoot somebody that&#39;s north of me, the arrow goes backwards. How do I make it so that the arrow always goes towards the person?

How do I make it when I attack somebody, the GFX appears on my character?

E.g. I have special attacks. I use Dragon Longsword and I use it&#39;s special. The animation appears on the other character at a wierd angle. The animation doesn&#39;t appear on my Dragon Longsword; it appears on the other character. How can I solve it? Picture -
