    <description>Hi there. My name is Devin, I&#39;ve recently finished up my BS in Computer Science and landed an internship at Intel here in Camas, WA.

Before I left the private server community to pursue my degree, I was the owner of the Eclipse servers, revisions 639 through 709. I&#39;m sure information on my previous servers is available via a simple Google search.

I am here today to offer my services, free of charge, to someone who is willing and dedicated to a project worth doing. Not for my own gain, but simply for the fact that at one point in my life, this community was the only thing I had in my life worth counting on. So if your project is looking for a 6th year-experienced content developer or web developer, please post here to bump this thread and serious inquiries please send a personal message.</description>
