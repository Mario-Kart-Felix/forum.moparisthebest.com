[CENTER][SIZE=5]BACKGROUND[/SIZE][/CENTER]

It was an idea to start a new, unique, never-before-seen RuneScape Private Server for months between two great friends. With months of talking about it, the motivation wasn&#39;t quite enough. But finally, we noticed that RuneScape Private Servers are just dying and repeating. In late November 2014, the name Ascaria was set in stone. Mod Jon, Owner, and Mod Four, Co-Owner, are the ones responsible for the birth of Ascaria.

[SIZE=5]STAFF TEAM[/SIZE]

[B]Server Owner:[/B] [I]Jon[/I]
[B]Co-Owner:[/B] [I]Four[/I]
[B]Lead Server Developer:[/B] [I]Austin[/I]
[B]Server Developer:[/B] [I]Jon, Four, and JKetelaar[/I]
[B]Website Developer:[/B] [I]Osiris[/I]

Everything is first [B]planned out[/B] so not only does the community see what&#39;s coming, but all the developers know exactly what to do. Everything from the client to the website is being updated daily to have the very best experience! There will be a lot of very fun custom content ranging from minigames to quests! Many of the custom content will be [I]unique, fun, and different[/I] than the average RuneScape Private Server.
