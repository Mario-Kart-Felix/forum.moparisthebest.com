    <title>Question about a PSU/GPU</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-a-psu-gpu/535676</link>
    <description>Alright guys I have an ATI Radeon 4870 HD Sapphire GPU and a Rosewill 500W psu. The graphics card requires two 6 pin connectors. My PSU has one. Was thinking about buying a molex to 6pin adapter. Something like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812887001

Was wondering if anybody here uses an adapter like that. How reliable are they etc</description>

              <p>You’ll be cutting it close to the max power output of that psu (maybe it throttled for your uncle but he didn’t notice). It’s recommended you should get a psu that can provide 50 more watts of power than you need (capacitor aging etc leads to more electricity usage too). Rough estimate because I have no clue what other componuts you have or even what psu it is but I’d estimate you only have 20w to spare which isn’t a lot at all + you’ll probably hear a coil whine from your psu since it’ll be at like 95% usage while gaming (assuming your system isn’t loud as hell).</p>
<p>You can buy the cables online though. I’m sure if you contacted Rosewill and claimed they got damaged (in a way that isn’t your fault) if it was still under warranty they’d replace it for free. Should only cost a few $ online to buy the cables elsewhere if not from Rosewill. In all honesty it’d probably be better just to get a better psu which you can use in your next system as well. It’s up to you though, I don’t know your financial situation.</p>
<p>P.S. An adapter like that should work, they just get hot. I have used voltage step down adapters in the past no issues apart from their hot so you should probably avoid buying them from … random sellers online because if their not constructed to a high quality they might catch fire etc.</p>

<p>Do you think it will bottleneck at all? I’m a newbie when it comes to building computers. My GPU didn’t come with any adapters because I got the GPU and PSU off of my uncle  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> So i have to buy all the adapters myself. Everything seems to be functional, only thing I need is a molex-6 pin adapter to actually test out my gpu.</p>
