    <title>Nobel Peace Prize</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nobel-peace-prize/307993</link>
    <description>Many of you probably know that he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Did he really earn it? 
What did he [b]actually[/b] do to get the prize?

[hr]
[quote=&quot;CNN&quot;]The committee said it honored Obama for his &quot;extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.&quot;

Obama said he viewed the decision less as a recognition of his own accomplishments and more as &quot;a call to action.&quot;

The decision appeared to catch most observers by surprise. Nominations for the prize had to be postmarked by February 1, only 12 days after Obama took office. The committee sent out its solicitation for nominations last September, two months before Obama was elected president.

Obama had not been mentioned as among front-runners for the prize, and the roomful of reporters gasped when Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Nobel committee, announced that the president was the winner.

The Nobel committee recognized Obama&#39;s efforts at dialogue to solve complex global problems, including working toward a world free of nuclear weapons. Video Watch CNN&#39;s Christiane Amanpour&#39;s analysis »

&quot;Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world&#39;s attention and given its people hope for a better future,&quot; the committee said.

Jagland said the decision was &quot;unanimous&quot; and came with ease. Video Watch the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize announcement »

He rejected the notion that Obama had been recognized prematurely for his efforts and said the committee wanted to promote the president just it had Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 for his efforts to open up the Soviet Union. Ed Rollins: Obama now must earn it

&quot;His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world&#39;s population,&quot; the committee said of Obama. Video Listen to Jagland explain why Obama was this year&#39;s choice.[/quote]</description>
