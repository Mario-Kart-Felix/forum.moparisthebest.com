    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-7-mining/460373</link>
    <description>Hey,

So I&#39;ve been trying to code some unique mining.

What I [u][b]want[/b][/u] to happen:

-I want the mining to be: when you click a rock, you go through a full mining animation, then receive an ore, and stop mining. You click the rock again, you receive another ore after the full animation, and repeat. I don&#39;t want the ore to run out at all, so you can continuously click the rock, do the mining animation, and receive an ore.

 
This is my code in mining.java :

[code]                Copper_Ore(1, 10, 436, 10, 10, 14906, 0, 1), 
		Tin_Ore(1, 10, 438, 10, 10, 14902, 0, 1), 
		Iron_Ore(15, 15, 440, 10, 10, 14856, 0, 1), 
		Coal_Ore(30, 25, 453, 10, 10, 14850, 0, 1), 
		Gold_Ore(40, 32, 444, 10, 10, 2098, 0, 1), 
		Mithril_Ore(55, 40, 447, 10, 10, 14853, 0, 1), 
		Adamant_Ore(70, 45, 449, 10, 10, 14862, 0, 1), 
		Runite_Ore(85, 50, 451, 10, 10, 14859, 0, 1);[/code]

When I mine one of the rocks, it entirely disappears after I receive an ore, and doesn&#39;t come back. It also does not take the full mining animation to receive an ore, the timer is completely random. 

Also, I can only mine the rocks when I&#39;m west of the rock, south of the rock, and north of the rock. Why not east?</description>

<p>I think this is your base to what you want to know. Can you show me how they are actually coded? Like oreRandomTime what does that actually do, the random timer that gives you the ore? I have a good guess of what they do but I can’t really say anything without knowing for sure.</p>

And for randomLifeProbability, when it’s set at 0, you can mine unlimited ores without stopping. I have it set at 1, so you mine one ore, then stop.</p>

<p>I got the timer pretty close to what I wanted, but what about the rocks disappearing after being mined?</p>

              <p>Hey,</p>
<p>So I’ve been trying to code some unique mining.</p>
<p>What I <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">want</span></span> to happen:</p>
<p>-I want the mining to be: when you click a rock, you go through a full mining animation, then receive an ore, and stop mining. You click the rock again, you receive another ore after the full animation, and repeat. I don’t want the ore to run out at all, so you can continuously click the rock, do the mining animation, and receive an ore.</p>
<p>This is my code in mining.java :</p>
<p><code>                Copper_Ore(1, 10, 436, 10, 10, 14906, 0, 1), 
		Tin_Ore(1, 10, 438, 10, 10, 14902, 0, 1), 
		Iron_Ore(15, 15, 440, 10, 10, 14856, 0, 1), 
		Coal_Ore(30, 25, 453, 10, 10, 14850, 0, 1), 
		Gold_Ore(40, 32, 444, 10, 10, 2098, 0, 1), 
		Mithril_Ore(55, 40, 447, 10, 10, 14853, 0, 1), 
		Adamant_Ore(70, 45, 449, 10, 10, 14862, 0, 1), 
		Runite_Ore(85, 50, 451, 10, 10, 14859, 0, 1);</code></p>
<p>When I mine one of the rocks, it entirely disappears after I receive an ore, and doesn’t come back. It also does not take the full mining animation to receive an ore, the timer is completely random.</p>
<p>Also, I can only mine the rocks when I’m west of the rock, south of the rock, and north of the rock. Why not east?</p>
