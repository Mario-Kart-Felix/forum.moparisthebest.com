    <description>A video of some kind of teleporting clip glitch. How do i fix this? Where is the code coming from?
If you think this is a troll, I&#39;m dead serious it isn&#39;t. I aint editing the clip or anything of a sort. Also
if you die from an opponent 2-3 squares off in melee fights. You tele near them and do the death emote.
0:14 is on of them, another is 1:25. Another thing is, how can I take the delays out from switching in server sided? Links or tuts please. Thnkx. Another thing is when a player wins a stake fight in duel arena, it shows the interface of the winning item, but the player doesnt get his/her item back with the staked item. Why is that? Pm me on skype please: kk_killah, look for the name paradox.
