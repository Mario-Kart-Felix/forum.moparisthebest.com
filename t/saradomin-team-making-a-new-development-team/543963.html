Hello everyone. Saradomin is a 317 pi.<br>
“At Saradomin, we strive to deliver unique, distinct, &amp; diverse content that’s exclusive to our server. We’re constantly trying to improve and expand, and will never stop working to provide our members with content of the highest quality.”</p>
<p>Something I truly believe in. I don’t want to be the rsps thats just like runescape or a replica. My plans for saradomin are not only big, but unique, ranging from a quest and storyline thats interactive with how players seem to be playing in the game. Where your choices truly change the server. Where though the war may never end zamorak cripples the saradomin army and supplies diminish and prices raise for saradomin followers. Though some if this such as direct things impacting the economy of a faction may be only a statement currently and should players and staff decide ageasnt it it may not truly happen. I want players to choose what Saradomin, truly is. And how it is formed and shaped. From every quest to content that may relate to the godwars depends on peoples views in ingame votes or polls by some npc to capture a view of what the players may want before we dish out the surprise update. I am looking for a truly unique team. A team dedicated to only Saradomin. Im not saying not to have a life. Or have free time. But I’m looking for the team that gets on there computer looking to enjoy some new content for the players coming. I am looking for a mature team.</p>
<p>You can find our project thread <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,662388.msg4429893.html#msg4429893" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> though it isn’t currently up to date.</p>
<p>Currently the project consists of only myself, and stuart(Riipiinftw). I have jusre removed all my developers to truly find the perfect fit for Saradomin. If you have previously been a developer here and were demoted you are still able to apply and join. This is simply to build the best development team possible. Here is what I am looking for.</p>
<p>Server developer.<br>
Client developer.<br>
Content developer.<br>
Web developer.<br>
Dedicated official gfx artist.<br>
(Funded? - not truly needed but always helpful.)<br>
I am also looking specifically (if possibly, not required) to someone with a vast knowledge of sql and java to integrate Saradomin very deeply with sql for some plans I have.</p>
<p>I am also looking for someone with the ability to make a nice loader. Or someone to make a swiftkit type client.</p>
<p>I have put quite abit of money into just the domain name, having to win it in a auction. I have prepaid hosting for a webhost for one year. I have a computer myself dedicated only to running Saradomin.</p>
<p>I am running virtual box on it with windows 2003, 7gb ram quad core i7 3.40 ghz. It will do the job. And if ever needed i can buy a real dedi or vps.</p>
<p>I have the money for all the ads when we are ready for a true release to push us straight on any and all rsps type sites. And make us one of the top over the course of less then a week or so from a release.</p>
<p>If you are looking to be apart of a soon to be top rsps. This is the server, you will want to join.</p>
<p>If you are interested, post here with your unique application format. Uniqueness is a must when joining saradomin, and don’t be boring. Consider this an interview. Be fun. Hope to see some creative people replying soon.</p>
