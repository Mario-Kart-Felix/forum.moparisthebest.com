    <description>Is it possible to alter this, and if so, how?

I tried replacing the 0x328 (Stand anim) with another anim in two different ways, firstly I tried just the anim on its own. (2256) But this gave me 100 errors, so seeing how the original was laid out I tried replacing it in both the client.java under weapons 

[code]else
{
return 0x328;
}
} 
[/code]
with 

[code]
else
{
return 0x2256;
}
} 
[/code]

I also edited the player.java, changing the original stance to the same anim.

When i compiled i got no errors, but in-game nothing had changed.

Does anyone know what I did wrong? Also, is it possible to make one stance just for the owner, meaning all other players stand normally, while the owner uses another anim?

Thanks</description>

<p>Well, it seems to have half-worked. When i log in, theres my character standing just as i want, but after you move it goes back to the normal standing position when you stand again.</p>
<p>Any ideas?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 21, 2008, 02:44:03 PM[/size][hr]Also, what about the “one stance for owner” thing i was talking about?</p>
<p>Any clue how to do that aswell?</p>
