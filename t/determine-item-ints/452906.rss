    <title>Determine item ints</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/determine-item-ints/452906</link>
    <description>Client sided work is always something I&#39;ve pushed away, but I&#39;ve started to realize it is important to at least have a small understanding of how things work. How exactly are model ints determined? I&#39;m very much aware that you can use a few programs to actually create models, but the question is.. how do you make them cooperate with the client?

If someone would be so nice to explain the process of this, as I have been let completely oblivious to this stage of model design.</description>
