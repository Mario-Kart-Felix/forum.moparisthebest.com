    <description>[font=arial black]NEWS[/font]
[font=arial]The cleaning project i released didn&#39;t go so well because i just switched from a windows 7 all the way down to an xp. Before i could send my work to my usb my dad deletes my account from the windows 7. So i thought, WHAT IFFFFF i could make my own version of runscape? Well right now I have just started.[/font]
[hr /]
[font=arial black]What Will happen[/font] - Part One, Models -
[font=arial]I need an expert modeler, someone who can issue out 317 models that don&#39;t look like crap, and then can add them into the places they must go. I can do that myself but it would be great to not have to do another development ALONE. If you can model just e-mail me at the e-mail at the bottom of the page and i will henceforth communicate with you.[/font]
[hr /]
[font=arial black]What Will happen[/font] - Part Two, Vision -
[font=arial]The reason i put models first was to emphasize on the fact that we need more customization to show how far rsps can really go. I myself am not an expert at java, perhaps the farthest thing. But i know that you guys are, so for those of you who can start this i encourage you to join. This is no nonsense, i want to get this done to the best i can. But the amount of time i have for rsps is sadly low. 

[table]
[tr]
[td]My vision of the new 317 (the nickname i will now henceforth give this project).
New character models
Clean cut graphics with a side of stability
New armor models (to fit around the new character models).
New all around models
Story lines
De fragmentation of the 317 client/source[/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

And that really is it, none of these things i can do alone (especially the modeling).[/font]
[hr /]
[font=arial black]What Will I Do?[/font]
[font=arial]For those of you thinking that having all of you guys do the work, you could be farther from the truth. As you guys slave away at the server and client, i will be organizing advertising and staff positions for the server, as well as adding a web client, working on easier web client integration. I will also help with any communication issues, and i have all the development software you need. There are alot of things that will be happening behind the scenes IF this does work out.[/font]
[hr /]
[font=arial black]Why Should I Join[/font]
[font=arial]Remember that alot of you will recieve credits (and unlike others I will personally make WEBPAGES dedicated to the different volunteers and what there services are, much like a biography type scenario). You will also gain access to the vast resources i have with me for development. 

If there is more than 5 people working on this development then we will start the development, if i can get more people then the less you and I will have to work. PLUS I guarantee that you will be satisfied with everything i have to offer.[/font]
[hr /]
[font=arial black]Contact[/font]
[font=arial]Right now i prefer you contact me on moparscape or zerocomfor, and since i am fairly buisy you should actually write your info here.[/font]
[hr /]
[font=arial black]Sign Up[/font]
[font=arial]to sign up you must have some good background of java and know what you are doing (unlike me lol).
Just C&amp;P this into your post
[/font]
[font=Comic Sans MS]NAME: ME
KNOWLEDGE OF COMPUTERS: (scale of 1-10, 10 being you know how to create your own applications from java)
WHEN DID YOU START CODING?:
WHAT ELSE SHOULD I KNOW?:
WHAT PART DO YOU WANT TO VOLUNTEER IN?:[/font]</description>
