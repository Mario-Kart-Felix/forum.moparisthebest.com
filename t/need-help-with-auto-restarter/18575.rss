    <title>Need help with Auto-Restarter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-auto-restarter/18575</link>
    <description>OK. I found a TUT for it on Rs-server.net. (For those wanting the link here it is: http://rs-server.net/forums/showthread.php?t=3134)

Anyway back to business. It&#39;s saying its suppose to run endserver.bat which supposedly ends the server obviously... But, the problem is, it doesn&#39;t... All it does is open the file, which has like one half of a sentence in it saying [code]tskill java /a[/code]

and it does nothing. 

Tasks does open runserver.bat but it doesn&#39;t close the first one. Does anyone know how to fix it and ACTUALLY make it turn off the server? 

Thanks in advance.[br][size=1]Posted at: 16 October 2006, 09:43:58[/size][hr]Can someone PLEASE help?? I really need 2 fix this damn thing..</description>
