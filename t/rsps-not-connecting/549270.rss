    <title>Rsps not connecting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-not-connecting/549270</link>
    <description>Hey all, so I am starting a server, which i am going to be hosting via a powerful desktop server machine I have untill i can get it coded up and fixed up to the point where a VPS is required.

However, I am having trouble connecting to it.

I have created a host with no-ip, and portforwarded (canyouseeme.org) says the port IS forwarded.

I have changed the client settings to use my no-ip address, and yes i did compile after, and it sits on &quot;checking for udpates - 0%&quot; I have also tried putting my physical ip instead of the no-ip address and it does the same.

Any help is appreciated?

thanks</description>

<p>I can get your IP within 5 seconds of logging into your server, even though you have no-ip.</p>
<p>Just JAR your client, that’s a better chance of people not finding your IP then actually using a shitty send-through system.[/quote]The point of no-ip is that if you have a dynamic IP, like most people who host at home do (it tends to change once in every few months) you just change it on the no-ip website or use the automatic tool to do this for you so you don’t need to change the IP on the client every time this happens. It’s not used for masking IP’s because that’s idiotic and even if it’s jarred it’s still rather easy to find the IP. Also completely irrelevant. NO-IP is also a host name and NOT a shitty send-through system like Hamachi is. It’s like <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a> instead of the actual IP.</p>
<p>OT: Have you tried connecting with localhost first? If so and it worked does the server or client show any errors/exceptions?<br>
You should also try connecting with the moparscape client if possible to make sure your client isn’t the issue.</p>
