    <title>What linux based OS should I get</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-linux-based-os-should-i-get/368214</link>
    <description>Well I haven&#39;t been on much because my hard drive is well done. (Ran a diagnostic test critical/fatal error in disk drive c:/ ) 

So I have decided to get a new computer and not get another hard-drive since my laptop isn&#39;t good enough for all I want to do. Only a 100gb hard-drive, 1gb Ram , 2.1mhz so it wasn&#39;t all that. I have decided to get a desktop (used). It has 4gb or ram 150gb of hard-drive space and its processing speed is 2.9mhz. 

I wanted to switch to a linux based OS for a while and I though this would be the perfect time to do so. So, please tell me what Linux based OS I should get. So far I thinking of getting Ubuntu. 

Im on the computer at school soposed to be finishing a website but eh don&#39;t feel like it.</description>

              <p>Generally I use Ubuntu and LUbuntu. Ubuntu is generally, one of the most popular linux bases OS’s around. I just like Lubuntu though because I have a low-end laptop that it runs smooth on. I would suggest Ubuntu though, as it is more known, and with those specs, would run just fine.</p>
