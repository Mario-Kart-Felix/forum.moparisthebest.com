    <title>Does anyone remember me?</title>

    <description>The answer is no.  But many things have changed on these forums and they are great.  I think this isn&#39;t spam or a leaving/joining/dying thread.  Well just would like to say that I&#39;m proud to say I was once very active on a community this great(not really that proud).  Well lock this if it does break any rules and I love the quiz at the beginning, it&#39;s lots of fun!</description>
