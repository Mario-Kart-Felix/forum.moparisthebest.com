              <p>[quote=“CoonHunter, post:2, topic:336064”]Are you sure it is not the server that is lagging? Typically, unless these are hard-coded in a java file, instead of the typical cfg, it should not have anything to do with the lag of your server. See about cleaning up your server and that might solve your problem, or get a new computer to host it on. Possibly even a VPS.[/quote] i tryed a new computer yesterday and its just not allstarscape i tried differnt sources to with the same thing happening and i have noticed that the items im talking about arent in the id list included in the server</p>
