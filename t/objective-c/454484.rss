    <title>Objective-C</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/objective-c/454484</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve only recently just started browsing this part of the forum again. For those who remember, i used to visit this section rather frequently. What I&#39;ve noticed is the lack of community awareness when it comes to anything other than Java. 

I&#39;m all for using a language that accommodates to your needs. However, i believe it&#39;s extremely beneficial for any aspiring programmer to dabble and explore other possibilities. I think it&#39;s safe to assume that most young starters hope to make this hobby into a career one day. I know many members have already started their path by enrolling into Computer Science courses at university. 

I strongly suggest that you all check out Objective-c. It&#39;s wonderful. Beautiful even. It&#39;s not for everyone however. If not, so be it. Below are some nice resources that may open your mind a little.

Firstly, an overview: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html

A little information on it&#39;s rapid success. Including it&#39;s overtaking of cpp in terms of popularity. This language is tipped to be the best money maker in 2013, as well as providing the most job opportunities in the industry:

For a good start, watch these informative videos. Excellent tutorials and by the 65th, you should have a decent idea on whether you like what it offers:

              <p>Thanks for those links, I never really read/watched a objective c tutorial before. I have, however, seen it’s syntax and threw up a little bit, but I’m willing to get past that and give it a proper try.</p>
