[FONT=arial black]Overview of Xealth:
[/FONT]Xealth is a new way of life for many users. It has many unique features, and it isn&#39;t Project Insanity. Many of you users may have heard of [B]InnovationX[/B] which was unfortunately shut down in the past month. There were many servers at InnovationX, but one of them was golden; 900 players daily, active staff among other unique features. Upon the shutdown [B]James [/B]wanted the users of InnovationX to be pleased, therefore bringing back a server that was in the glory days a top 5 server in the RuneScape Private Server community.

I know a lot of the users enjoy Project Insanity, but deep down inside we all know that Battlescape holds a place in our hearts. That&#39;s why we based it upon it, to get out of the mainstream hype and hopefully restore Battlescape&#39;s greatness, which once was what every server wanted to be, but sadly they never made it that far. Xealth strives to give you the best game-play available at [B]any[/B] of the other RuneScape Private Servers, meaning we won&#39;t give up any time soon..
