    <title>Layouts on the forums</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/layouts-on-the-forums/453778</link>
    <description>For the last 2 years or maybe even longer I have been coming to Moparscape every now and then and i always see this ugly layout that they have. I suggest that maybe there could be a option to change your layout. Since I think these forums can get more swagged out if they put some effort in it.</description>
