    <title>Would anyone be interested in a Yogcraft (FTB) server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-anyone-be-interested-in-a-yogcraft-ftb-server/518394</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got a pretty badass new PC that I kinda feel like hosting a server on. It uses the same launcher as the main server (you may have seen the pack in the mod list), and I have an easy to use Sphax 64x texture pack you can use if you like. (Hard to find other FTB packs)

Also, would have to be discussed, but I am not opposed to having little cheats to get us started (nobody wants to go around collecting diamonds to start up again, right?)... basically sort creative to get started and then we have to actually build our own stuff to become self sufficient, etc.

All assuming this site isnt just completely dead of course, havent checked in a while  :o</description>
