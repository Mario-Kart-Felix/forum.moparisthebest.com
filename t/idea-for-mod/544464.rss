    <title>Idea for Mod?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/idea-for-mod/544464</link>
    <description>Ever notice how there are so many different&#39;s of the same things in modded games? You can have like 5 funaces, 3 different grinders, and 8 Generators/engines depending on power sources and what not. 
Well I was thinking of possibly making a &quot;simple&quot; mod that would serve as an [b]interface[/b] so all furnaces could act the same. 

I think it would save on config file space. Allow mod developers to basically use what they have already. Since it would be a package of abstracts - They would still be free to override any methods they needed to. On top of it all would have to be a manager. 

I have no experience with mod making for Minecraft but i think this would be a very powerful tool with minimal work. What do you guys think?

I would also add a &quot;Power Source&quot; interface to simplify that as well.


Do you guys think this would be a manageable task?</description>

<p>Although I do like your idea of a power source interface. I’d like a central hub where I can see how much energy per tick is being used for each machine and to be able to dedicate x amount of power to any given machine from this same interface.</p>
