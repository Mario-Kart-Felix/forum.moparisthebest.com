    <title>Some Raps by my Brother-In Law</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-raps-by-my-brother-in-law/352258</link>
    <description>Alright, well my brother-in law is 24 years old and hes been getting into rapping. I really like his music, he has alot of songs and has been doing this for over 6 years now. His name is Marc. Him and his friend Teddy call themselves Black Label. You can add them on facebook by searching Black Label. Theres a picture of him and his partner Teddy as the display. Theyre just starting to become famous in Detroit and have been noticed by Kid Rock [Country and Rock singer]

So here im just gonna give you a download link with 3 of his songs in it.

He likes to sample and remake songs so if you recodnize some thats why. Ill explain what theyre samples from/what theyre remade from.

Im So Alone
The track named &quot;Im So Alone&quot; is sampled from All i Ever Wanted - Basshunter.

Track 14
Track 14 is a remade version of Unforgettable - Drake ft Alicia Keys. The girl that sings in it is actually my sister.

02 Track 2
Track 2 is a remake of Nirvana - Smells like Team Spirit.

Rap is not something you really correct grammer in, otherwise it would just sound even more stupid than it is.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@TOPIC</span> - I wish them luck, I wont be one of the fan’s as i have never found rap that i like, so i have discontinued my listening in that genre.</p>
