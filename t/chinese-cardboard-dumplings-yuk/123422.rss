    <title>Chinese Cardboard Dumplings(yuk)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chinese-cardboard-dumplings-yuk/123422</link>
    <description>Yet another glorious fact about the people’s paradise of China-  the dumplings you buy are made out of cardboard, bacon fat and lye.  If you are one of those people planning to go to China for the Olympic games, you may want to bring a sack lunch with you.

Hilarious and not surprising, from the AP here:

    Chopped cardboard, softened with an industrial chemical and flavored with fatty pork and powdered seasoning, is a main ingredient in batches of steamed buns sold in one Beijing neighborhood.

    Countless small, often illegally run operations exist across China and make money cutting corners by using inexpensive ingredients or unsavory substitutes. They are almost impossible to regulate.

    Baozi are a common snack in China, with an outer skin made from wheat or rice flour and and a filling of sliced pork. Cooked by steaming in immense bamboo baskets, they are similar to but usually much bigger than the dumplings found on dim sum menus familiar to many Americans.

    The hidden camera follows the man, whose face is not shown, into a ramshackle building where steamers are filled with the fluffy white buns, traditionally stuffed with minced pork.

But in this instance-

    Squares of cardboard picked from the ground are first soaked to a pulp in a plastic basin of caustic soda — a chemical base commonly used in manufacturing paper and soap — then chopped into tiny morsels with a cleaver. Fatty pork and powdered seasoning are stirred in.

MMM, tasty.  At least its not cat.

So, what do you think people? how would you like to eat cardboard in a bun treated with industrial chemicals that probably are toxic?</description>
