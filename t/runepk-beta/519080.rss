[B][U]History of RunePK;[/U][/B]

RunePK was a somewhat popular server that was released around May 2012, The owners ( Jamie and Jake) were both brothers
and their goal was to make a half Pk and a half Remake server, they didn&#39;t bring anything new to the RSPS community,but simply
refined the best parts of a RSPS in my opinion. They reached around a 100+ Player base daily. Jake was a very quiet but kind Owner.
Jamie was very aggressive and cocky,which leaded to the downfall of the server,with players abusing a cheat client released by Nando
( [url=http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/downloads/410229-runepk-cheatclient.html]http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/downloads/410229-runepk-cheatclient.html[/url] ) getting billions,dupes left and right the server fell. Due to how ruined the economy began they had no choice but to shut down, 
although controversial they said they were shut down by Jagex. They soon came back on Youtube informing 
that they are making a new server called &quot;Reviry&quot; which has not come out 
to this day.

Posting this to try and help bugs be found for austin.
