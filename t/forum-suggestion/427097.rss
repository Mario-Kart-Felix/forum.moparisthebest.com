    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/forum-suggestion/427097</link>
    <description>Well you see this a lot in tech forums for VB.

What I am suggesting is a mod to be added as such so where on server help/client help/general questions maybe you mark the topic as [unresolved] or [solved]

when it is in the [solved] tag it would automatically lock the topic. Only a moderator or the topic owner be able to change it back if the problem was perceived to be fixed but did not actually fix it. 

The reason why I am suggesting this is I grow tired of seeing troll/flame comments on topic that have already been answered. 

[hr]

Another item I would like to suggest is giving topic owners in the same sections power to delete user comments that are not needed. The reason for this is to help moderatoe your own topic without having to wait five plus hours for a moderator to come a long and give a &quot;warning&quot;

I feel that both of these suggestions are useful and could work out to be very good.</description>

<p><em>sigh</em> Although I like the idea of resolved/unresolved, I feel like this needs to be said at least every 6 months or so. We don’t lock topics just because the question is answered. What if someone wants to solve something, searches for it, sees that topic, but has additional information to add/request? Should they post an entirely new topic that needs to go through the process all over again?</p>

              <p>hmm I see the arguments here on both sides about locking/merging/not doing anything. I have a better solution.</p>
<p>This WILL require some maintence obviously but I feel over a course of time this could be good.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a sticky with all the various revisions/bases.</li>
<li>Like several tutorial stickies you list all the different  topics in general. so for example " how  to do this - 317 - PI " etc.</li>
<li>IF the answer cannot be sent from the source or found in the source (the stickied thread) then the person’s [UNRESOLVED] thread will appear. Like…let’s say every month for instance a staff member could go and “update” this thread with the new entries.</li>
<li>I still support that once the issue has been fixed that the topic is locked as it will be in the database/sticky thread then. (When you lock it, it could automatically make a link to the topic in the database/sticky thread? )</li>
<li>The topic would go to [RESOLVED] status.</li>
</ol>
<p>OR</p>
<ol>
<li>Somebody makes a database/sticky thread with a hell a lot of information like the other suggestion</li>
<li>server help/general help/client help/general questions/whatever turns into more of a “ticket” system.</li>
<li>upon completion of the help to the person the topic would be forwarded to the team handling the sticky thread/database to be added. The topic COULD stay opened for addendum etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>But in all honesty, something DOES need to be done. The server help section is literally swamped with good and bad help questions. Some aren’t even related to the proper places and even with reports to moderators it never gets moved cause there are so many. Only way to start change is to contribute to it.</p>
<p>I would be, and I am sure there are several members of the community who would be glad to help with updating/keep up to date a vast database of some sorts.</p>

              <p>And what is the harm of locking a thread? Making this suggestion related to making the forums look like ‘trash’ would be irrelevant due to the fact that this forum is quite a dull place, and I understand that members have yet to find a solution or reasonable solution in this case to make these forums a little dull, I mean look at Rune-Server, those administrators strive their best (from what I know) to make the community happy with SOTW, daily updates to the forums etc., and what do we have?</p>
<p>If this suggestion was to be put into place, where is the harm in that? It could be removed within a matter of seconds, and I do remember MITB stating in some place that when moderator(s) make a decision to delete, lock, stick etc., a thread – he can recover all made decisions to what was originally ‘seen’.</p>
<p>What has the moderators for MoparScape, Moparisthebest etc. done for us to make us like this forum? If I’m not mistaken, the reputation of this site is incompetent, immature, disgrace,drop-outs etc., so how can we even change that aspect of our community when we don’t even want to do some LITTLE updates for these forums as a whole?</p>
<p>Once a new member has joined, there told that MITB are full of assholes and dick-heads just because that part of the community wants to be with their “own” because they feel as if the “outsiders” are bunch of morons.</p>
<p>In a full conclusion, what is the harm?</p>

I support auto-locking either way, if the problem is solved, there’s no reason for anybody to still post on the topic. If anyone still posts it’s usually either because they need to finish an argument with someone, or they feel the need to spam. I think auto-lock would be a good idea because it would prevent spam and/or flame.<br>
[/quote]I disagree completely, there are plenty of reasons to reply to a solved question. You could present a better answer, or someone could post a slight variation of the issue, there are many examples. Locking them just encourages people to spam the help section with similar questions over and over again.<br>
[/quote]They spam the help section with the exact, not just similar, question nearly everyday. Have you not been on the help section in a while? Plus these people asking for help don’t care how good the content is, all they want is something that works. After getting the code that works, 80-90% of people don’t come back to their topic anyways. Presenting better code is virtually useless.[/quote]No, because then if somebody else searches for the answer (and you’d be surprised how many do, they just either lurk as guests or did a google search that linked to Moparscape), the better answer is there if they want it.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick stat from right now:<br>
169 Guests, 81 Users</p>
<p>I think we should help guests too, even if the ‘users’ are the ones spamming the help section. If people see a repeated question, I actually encourage you to report it with the link to a thread that has the answer so we can try to foster a more self-sufficient environment. You may just actually want to PM me it, as other moderators may not do anything about it (which is fair, as they don’t break the rules) and close the report before I see it.</p>

              <p>If i could add onto this topic (since all my posts are ‘moderated’ i don’t think a topic would do me any good). Why not get rid of the bitchy reputation sysem and add a ‘like’ and ‘dislike’ button for every post (NOT FOR FACEBOOK, JUST A BUTTON WITH A LIKE COUNT). It’s very simple if you use javascript or ajax.</p>

              <p>I’ve seen this suggestion before, like a lot of others it was generally accepted (iirc) and then nothing happened.</p>
<p>Software like MyBB have this already implemented, it’s called a prefix system, you can have specific prefix’s for certain boards and such. There are probably SMF mods for it though.</p>
<p>Though like Taharok said, why would you need to lock solved topics? It seems pointless, what harm does allowing a reply do, unless it’s spam (which they could do on any topic.)?</p>
<p>So basically I support prefix’s but not auto-locking or anything of that sort.</p>
