    <title>Javac Error Compile Help (For Impsoft Aryan Issue)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/javac-error-compile-help-for-impsoft-aryan-issue/1933</link>
    <description>Ok, so let&#39;s say you&#39;re getting a javac error or w/e when you try to compile to use impsofts aryan, I have a helpful tip that worked for me without all the technical mumbo jumbo, since I for one suck horribly at it.

Step 1.  Make sure you have a script pack d/led into a previous aryan, like mopars for example that already has them all compiled.

Step 2. Open up another folder with the Impsoft Aryan into it and create a new folder label it &quot;Scripts&quot;

Step 3. Go back to the scripts that are in the (ex.) Mopars aryan and select all of them by right clicking and dragging your mouse. and then copying them CTRL+C 

Step 4. Make sure you still have that other window opened with the new scripts folder.

Step 5. Then as you enter back into that window, paste all of the (ex) Mopars already compiled scripts into there...

Hope I could help if you were having any issue&#39;s!

This worked for me I don&#39;t know if it will work for anyone else, but just in-case people are having problems!  ENJOY!</description>
