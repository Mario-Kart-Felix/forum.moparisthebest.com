    <title>What changes is each revision?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-changes-is-each-revision/352028</link>
    <description>So I think it&#39;s time I listened to my players and moved onto a new cache. But I don&#39;t want to download a new source and start from scratch again. I was just wondering if there is anything I would need to change server-sided besides uKeys and (possibly) the login protocol to allow a newer client to connect properly and work. Can someone with experience in this area help me? If all I need to do is change the uKeys, then examine the login protocol and see if I need to change anything, I could probably just do it tonight.</description>
