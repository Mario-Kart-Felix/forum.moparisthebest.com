    <title>How to remove stupid Netbean&#39;s long build folder?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-remove-stupid-netbeans-long-build-folder/526790</link>
    <description>I was trying to remove my server from my system, but then, I saw the build directory and it was sooo long. I tried renaming all of them to be one letter, but at some point, it said I cannot rename them anymore.

Any ideas?</description>
