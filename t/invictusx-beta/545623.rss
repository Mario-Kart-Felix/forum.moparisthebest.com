    <description>Friendly Community
I would like this RSPS to be know for a great and friendly community! What this means is for all players new and old to feel welcome and comfortable with all the players and staff! Staff will help maintain this peace. These staff will be personly chosen by me and the players/community will have a big say in the staff! Thanks and a warm welcome to all new players! Please communicate to use with the &quot;Contact Us&quot; Tab or talk to us on the fourms!
Great Customs and Home!
