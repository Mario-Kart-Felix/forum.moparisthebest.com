    <title>Help with some (hopefully) minor problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-some-hopefully-minor-problem/7547</link>
    <description>Ok this is what is happening. Whenever I go to Yahoo, Hotmail or RuneScape and enter my User and Pass and then press Login the &quot;This Page cannot be displayed&quot; message comes up. It also happens with MSN Messenger, it says Cannot login, troublshoot problem and when I do it says things about DNS Server and ports. This happens to me occasionally and I always fix it by System Restoring. This time I tried it 2 or 3 times and it still is screwing me up.

Can someone come up with an explanation for this =/
