    <title>Free server idea for a coding team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/free-server-idea-for-a-coding-team/279701</link>
    <description>I think this idea could be used as a &quot;team&quot; development project, instead of just one individual. I thought it could help create more inspiration for others, that rsc development is currently too close minded about what is possible to make. This is not a &quot;mini-game&quot; idea, but an actual server in itself.

It didn&#39;t take long to write and there&#39;s alot of stuff I probably missed but I&#39;m currently in a hurry.

Please provide some add on&#39;s that I may have missed and some idea&#39;s on how the concept could be improved. Flaws/good points etc. 

This would take a lot of hard work to make. It would require a team.

I will not be participating but I will how-ever organize a team of developers, private forums and website. The dev team will be not be limited, but new people will be voted in. Post if you wish to be apart of it and I will organize forums on my website.

Rush (variation of Gun Game)

Concept: Rush game where you have to use almost every main weapon in the available rsc item list at least once. You start off with an iron 2h and slowly upgrade. In order to get a level up or an upgrade your weapon you must  someone with the weapon that is associated with the leve you are on. For example, the Iron 2h is level 1. In order to advance to level 2 (the Steel 2h) you must kill somebody with an Iron 2h.

Rush improves your skill and profiecency with every weapon, this way you can learn to become a pro with each weapon.

Round time: 60 minutes or until player reaches final level. A timer is shown with how long left in the round.

Maps: Intervals of main towns/wilderness etc. Interchanging after the time limit reaches zero. All players will then be teleported to the new map/town and start again at level 1.

The below weapons have no weapons level restrictions;

Level/Inventory/(stats, Atk, Def, Str):


Level 1: Iron 2h, 3 lobs (1 1 10)
Level 2: Steel 2h 4 lobs (5 1 8)
Level 3: Black axe, 5 lobs (8 1 10)
Level 4:  Mith axe, 6 lobs (8 1 12)
Level 5: Fire strike, 8 lobs (1 20 1)
Level 6: Full black, mith axe 6 lobs (10 8 12) 
Level 7: Full black Earth bolt, 8 lobs ( 1 15 1)
Level 8: Mith 2h, 7 lobs ( 12 1 14)
Level 9: Addy Axe, 8 lobs ( 15 1 13)
Level 10: Full black kite w/Addy long, 9 lobs (12 15 15)
Level 11:  Full mith w/ Water blast, 7 lobs ( 1 20 1)
Level 12: Addy 2h , 6 swordfish (23 1 25)
Level 13: Full addy w/Fire blast, 8 swordfish (1 25 1)
Level 14: Addy 2h w/str ammy, 31 prayer, 10 swordfish (30 1 40)
Level 15: Rune baxe, 10 swordfish (40 1 48)
Level 16: Full addy w/Water wave def ammy, 10 sharks (1 40 1)
Level 17: Rune baxe, full addy kite, str ammy, 10 sharks ( 40 30 55)
Level 18: Rune 2h str ammy, 15 sharks, (33 1 68)
Level 19: Fire wave, 15 sharks ( 1 1 75)
Level 20: Rune 2h str ammy, 20 sharks (15 1 99)
Level 21: Full rune, baxe, ammy, 10 sharks (40 40 70)
Level 22: Dragon long, ammy, 18 sharks, str pot, (60 1 73)
Level 23: Dragon Axe, ammy, 12 sharks, (45 1 88)
Level 24: Full rune, r2h ammy, 10 sharks, (50 50 92)
Level 25: Dwarf Cannon, 1 shark (1 1 1) Place on floor, shoots multiple targets. Hits between 10 and 30. 
Level 26: Guthix. 0 food (1 1 1) Once casted you have to wait 5 seconds to re-cast.
Final level: Crossbow, 20 bolts, 0 food. (1 1 1, with 5 range). 

To level up you will require 2-3 kills on the one level.

Not everybody will be attackable to everybody. I think it&#39;s fair to say 2-3 levels of somebody within your level should be applicable.

Teams: Will be divided into two and randomly allocated as per a team balance. Two seperate respawn spots for different sides. If player count is unfair a team balance will occur and will select an appropriate player to switch. That player, next time they die will respawn in the other teams spawn. Team mates cannot be attacked.

Highscores: Will be kept for players with most wins. Although a team effort, individuals will have to thrive.

Extras: May include team vantage points/flags in which if captured can provide bonus levels e.g. Team A captures Team B&#39;s flag and returns it to Team B&#39;s base. That player on the way to their base (whilst holding the flag) will be surrounded by a large crystal, to notify team A of who has their flag. The player who returns it to Team B&#39;s base will receive an extra level.

When you kill somebody their inventory will not drop on the ground. 

Once dying your inventory will be, again filled with the starting base package.

              <p>I love the idea, I would play it. My put on this idea is that instead of like getting 2-3 kills to level up I would make it like 10+ depending on the amount of people playing the game. You should do something like Combat Arms in which you use gamerpoints to buy new armor, weapons, ect. I’m not willing to help with the project as I’m all tied up working on my game. If you make a forums or a website I’ll be sure post ideas for it. Good luck developing a team of coders to work on.</p>

              <p>This “gun game” idea sounds very enjoyable, as a mini-game. I’m hoping that this is just a mini-game idea, and not the framework for an entire server. As for the coding, it shouldn’t be difficult at all, especially if you manage to get a team of programmers to work on it.</p>

              <p>I think this idea could be used as a “team” development project, instead of just one individual. I thought it could help create more inspiration for others, that rsc development is currently too close minded about what is possible to make. This is not a “mini-game” idea, but an actual server in itself.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long to write and there’s alot of stuff I probably missed but I’m currently in a hurry.</p>
<p>Please provide some add on’s that I may have missed and some idea’s on how the concept could be improved. Flaws/good points etc.</p>
<p>This would take a lot of hard work to make. It would require a team.</p>
<p>I will not be participating but I will how-ever organize a team of developers, private forums and website. The dev team will be not be limited, but new people will be voted in. Post if you wish to be apart of it and I will organize forums on my website.</p>
<p>Rush (variation of Gun Game)</p>
<p>Concept: Rush game where you have to use almost every main weapon in the available rsc item list at least once. You start off with an iron 2h and slowly upgrade. In order to get a level up or an upgrade your weapon you must  someone with the weapon that is associated with the leve you are on. For example, the Iron 2h is level 1. In order to advance to level 2 (the Steel 2h) you must kill somebody with an Iron 2h.</p>
<p>Rush improves your skill and profiecency with every weapon, this way you can learn to become a pro with each weapon.</p>
<p>Round time: 60 minutes or until player reaches final level. A timer is shown with how long left in the round.</p>
<p>Maps: Intervals of main towns/wilderness etc. Interchanging after the time limit reaches zero. All players will then be teleported to the new map/town and start again at level 1.</p>
<p>The below weapons have no weapons level restrictions;</p>
<p>Level/Inventory/(stats, Atk, Def, Str):</p>
<p>Level 1: Iron 2h, 3 lobs (1 1 10)<br>
Level 2: Steel 2h 4 lobs (5 1 8)<br>
Level 3: Black axe, 5 lobs (8 1 10)<br>
Level 4:  Mith axe, 6 lobs (8 1 12)<br>
Level 5: Fire strike, 8 lobs (1 20 1)<br>
Level 6: Full black, mith axe 6 lobs (10 8 12)<br>
Level 7: Full black Earth bolt, 8 lobs ( 1 15 1)<br>
Level 8: Mith 2h, 7 lobs ( 12 1 14)<br>
Level 9: Addy Axe, 8 lobs ( 15 1 13)<br>
Level 10: Full black kite w/Addy long, 9 lobs (12 15 15)<br>
Level 11:  Full mith w/ Water blast, 7 lobs ( 1 20 1)<br>
Level 12: Addy 2h , 6 swordfish (23 1 25)<br>
Level 13: Full addy w/Fire blast, 8 swordfish (1 25 1)<br>
Level 14: Addy 2h w/str ammy, 31 prayer, 10 swordfish (30 1 40)<br>
Level 15: Rune baxe, 10 swordfish (40 1 48)<br>
Level 16: Full addy w/Water wave def ammy, 10 sharks (1 40 1)<br>
Level 17: Rune baxe, full addy kite, str ammy, 10 sharks ( 40 30 55)<br>
Level 18: Rune 2h str ammy, 15 sharks, (33 1 68)<br>
Level 19: Fire wave, 15 sharks ( 1 1 75)<br>
Level 20: Rune 2h str ammy, 20 sharks (15 1 99)<br>
Level 21: Full rune, baxe, ammy, 10 sharks (40 40 70)<br>
Level 22: Dragon long, ammy, 18 sharks, str pot, (60 1 73)<br>
Level 23: Dragon Axe, ammy, 12 sharks, (45 1 88)<br>
Level 24: Full rune, r2h ammy, 10 sharks, (50 50 92)<br>
Level 25: Dwarf Cannon, 1 shark (1 1 1) Place on floor, shoots multiple targets. Hits between 10 and 30.<br>
Level 26: Guthix. 0 food (1 1 1) Once casted you have to wait 5 seconds to re-cast.<br>
Final level: Crossbow, 20 bolts, 0 food. (1 1 1, with 5 range).</p>
<p>To level up you will require 2-3 kills on the one level.</p>
<p>Not everybody will be attackable to everybody. I think it’s fair to say 2-3 levels of somebody within your level should be applicable.</p>
<p>Teams: Will be divided into two and randomly allocated as per a team balance. Two seperate respawn spots for different sides. If player count is unfair a team balance will occur and will select an appropriate player to switch. That player, next time they die will respawn in the other teams spawn. Team mates cannot be attacked.</p>
<p>Highscores: Will be kept for players with most wins. Although a team effort, individuals will have to thrive.</p>
<p>Extras: May include team vantage points/flags in which if captured can provide bonus levels e.g. Team A captures Team B’s flag and returns it to Team B’s base. That player on the way to their base (whilst holding the flag) will be surrounded by a large crystal, to notify team A of who has their flag. The player who returns it to Team B’s base will receive an extra level.</p>
<p>When you kill somebody their inventory will not drop on the ground.</p>
<p>Once dying your inventory will be, again filled with the starting base package.<br>
[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 21, 2009, 10:44:33 pm[/size][hr]I forgot to add. New people who join late will start with the average level of the players currently playing.</p>
