    <description>[i](continued from [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,381597.msg2873702.html#msg2873702]here[/url])[/i]

Most of my beef with wxWidgets lies in the core component wxAui, which is a docking manager for the library. It is quite amateur, and I have first-hand experience of that, and since docking is a functionality used in many applications, this is not true:
&lt;blockquote&gt;wxWidgets can be used perfectly for almost any kind of program&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While we&#39;re talking about false statements, let&#39;s throw some more up on the board:
&lt;blockquote&gt;QT is not C++&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It also means that since millions of people use these controls, it is extremely unlikely to find a significant bug in one of them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;QT on the other side renders the controls itself, trying to imitate native controls, being ... more prone to look &amp; feel discrepancies&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The primary reason I switched to Qt from wxWidgets was because wxWidgets does focus more on WINAPI than the other platforms supported by the &quot;cross-platform library,&quot; which leads to look &amp; feel discrepancies between versions of the application you&#39;re trying to make. For example, it doesn&#39;t do actual MDI in Linux, it just uses tabbing as an alternative. You&#39;re right, wxWidgets uses native controls whenever possible, even if it leads to discrepancies; they seem to honor speed above the cross-platform aspect of a &quot;cross-platform library.&quot; Therefore Qt does a better job at achieving this goal.

<p>Obviously but everything in the movie goes smooth as it should be, neither are their any bug reports on the internet (other then a few years old).<br>

<p>Yes, I meant both when talking about a docking manager. The control itself also has to be scalable for the number of items it controls. For example, if you look at the wxAui sample that comes with the library, you see it can dock a lot of things, and they have the different properties that you can set for docked/undocked windows. More importantly, if you play around with this sample, you should probably start to see at least a bug or two (I haven’t worked on it in over a year, so maybe they fixed everything). In any case, you can’t tell how well a control works by looking at a screenshot of it.[/quote]<br>
True, screenshots show nothing. The video below it does:<br>

<p>GTK+ itself is C which kinda means I’d never use it, however GTKmm (Which is a C++ wrapper for it) is somewhat popular and said to have a better C++ API than both wxWidgets and QT, but I’ve never really tried it myself yet.</p>

<p>zstars, there are a couple problems with your lists. The first, most prominent thing is that it’s way too short and shallow; you didn’t scratch the surface of a comparison between the two libraries, because in order to do that, we have to compare the different components and how well they work together and how much additional functionality is provided. And there has to be evidence. You keep saying that Qt is “more prone to native OS look &amp; feel discrepancies,” but I haven’t yet seen any myself.</p>
<p>Oh, and to anyone asking about GTK+: I’ve never used it, and I know zstars is a wxWidgets fanboy and I’m a Qt fanboy so I figured we’d try to finally settle this.</p>

I tried it at first, but on that moment I used glade to build the GUI but I couldn’t enjoy it. After that I tried wxFormBuilder and figured out how it worked, so I sticked with it.<br>
However I might understand Glade now, because I was used to visual studio alike GUI builders (easy to dock/align etc) while these GUI builders require sizers etc. Which isn’t bad, but it is annoying if you never did it before <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

There are two things that can be called docking.<br>
One: the thing I said.<br>
<img src="http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/3913/vsdock.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Two: Able to dock it on realtime by moving it etc. Which you meant (which I didn’t check, which was my mistake).<br>
Still if I look at: <a href="http://www.kirix.com/labs/wxaui/screenshots.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.kirix.com/labs/wxaui/screenshots.html</a> it looks to be working perfectly.</p>

I find your attempts to contribute to this subject amusing, given your lack of real, supporting evidence. Until you decide to come back with something substantial, stay at the kids' table, drink your juice, and let the adults talk for a while. For the future, you may also want to learn what functionality a docking manager actually provides.

<p>Most of my beef with wxWidgets lies in the core component wxAui, which is a docking manager for the library. It is quite amateur, and I have first-hand experience of that, and since docking is a functionality used in many applications, this is not true:</p>
<blockquote>wxWidgets can be used perfectly for almost any kind of program</blockquote>
<p>While we’re talking about false statements, let’s throw some more up on the board:</p>
<blockquote>QT is not C++</blockquote>
<blockquote>It also means that since millions of people use these controls, it is extremely unlikely to find a significant bug in one of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>QT on the other side renders the controls itself, trying to imitate native controls, being ... more prone to look &amp; feel discrepancies</blockquote>
<p>The primary reason I switched to Qt from wxWidgets was because wxWidgets does focus more on WINAPI than the other platforms supported by the “cross-platform library,” which leads to look &amp; feel discrepancies between versions of the application you’re trying to make. For example, it doesn’t do actual MDI in Linux, it just uses tabbing as an alternative. You’re right, wxWidgets uses native controls whenever possible, even if it leads to discrepancies; they seem to honor speed above the cross-platform aspect of a “cross-platform library.” Therefore Qt does a better job at achieving this goal.</p>
