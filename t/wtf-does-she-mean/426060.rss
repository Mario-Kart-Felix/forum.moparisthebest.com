    <title>Wtf does she mean?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf-does-she-mean/426060</link>
    <description>So, my girlfriend and I just broke up... And, I asked (ofcourse) what I did wrong.

She said:
&quot;You&#39;re very sweet and nice, and I really like you. But 
I don&#39;t love you.&quot;

So my question is:
What is the difference between liking someone really much and loving someone??

<p>Don’t be so hard on yourself though. Sometimes people just don’t blend well. Sometimes we’re just incompatible. You will eventually figure out what’s your fault and what’s not.

<p>As for fourteen year olds feeling love? I’d say it’s hard for people of that age to distinguish the difference between love, attachment and lust.[/quote]<br>

<p>When i was 14 I was crazy <span class="bbcode-b">IN LOVE</span> with my girlfriend. My parents and her parents always said we we’re too young to be in love, but she was awesome, we had so much in common and everything was perfect (for me atleast) then she broke up with me cuz i wouldn’t please her correctly or something (i found out later) she said pretty much the same thing, I’m guessing that your girlfriend was looking for a deeper relationship (It doesn’t have to be sex) but she wants something more then what you were giving to her.</p>
<p>List what you did and didn’t do with her and I might be able to give you some suggestions <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>They think they are too young but in truth teenagers at a point are the most capable of being in love as our hormones are practically forcing us to find a mate.</p>

              <p>Well love has a few different realistic meanings to people at different ages/stages of life.</p>
<p>Overall though, Love is the ultimate confession of how truly you feel for somebody. When a person loves somebody that person is willing to do whatever it takes to protect, to be with, and to cherish anything and everything that loved one says and/or does.</p>
<p>Love at the same time can be dangerous to say the least. it creeps into your heart, and it grabs you hard, it clings so much that you can’t get rid of it. Even if you two break up, if there was any love between each other that love will still be there after.</p>

              <p>If you’ve ever been in love this question would come easily to you</p>
<p>OP: Love:<span class="bbcode-b">Love</span> is patient, love is kind. It has no envy, nor it boasts itself and it is never proud. It rejoices over the evil and is the truth seeker. Love protects; preserves and hopes for the positive aspect of life. Always stand steadfast in love, not fall into it. It is like the dream of your matter of affection coming true.   Love can occur between two or more individuals. It bonds them and connects them in a unified link of trust, intimacy and interdependence. It enhances the relationship and comforts the soul. Love should be experienced and not just felt. The depth of love can not be measured. Look at the relationship between a mother and a child. The mother loves the child unconditionally and it can not be measured at all.   A different dimension can be attained between any relationships with the magic of love. Love can be created. You just need to focus on the goodness of the other person.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Like</span> is texting,holding hands, yet liking someone doesn’t show you’re affection towards you’re partner. Say you like a girl in you’re homeroom, yes you like her, but would you want to live you’re life with her? Wake up in bed everyday next to her? Wrap you’re arms around her when she’s sobbing? Take care of her like a man is supposed to? No. In fact, at you’re age, you’re not ready for love.</p>

That primal level of wanting someone as a mate mentally and physically. Best to just move on or become friends, maybe you guys will click on a deeper level someday. Good luck mate.</p>
