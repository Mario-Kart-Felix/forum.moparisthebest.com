    <title>Unmute,unban command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unmute-unban-command/301919</link>
    <description>now look when i mute someone, it will write his name in the mute list.
if i wanna unmute him i need to go to the list and delete his name.
how do i make a command for unmuting and unbaning.

i already got this
[code]}
if (command.startsWith(&quot;unmute&quot;)) {
	try {
		String muted = command.substring(7);
		int playerMuted = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(muted);
		client m = (client) server.playerHandler.players[playerMuted];
		m.sM(&quot;A member of staff has lifted your mute, allowing you to talk again&quot;);
		sM(muted+&quot; is no longer permanently muted&quot;);
	}
	catch(Exception e) {
		sM(&quot;Enter the name of the player you want to unmute&quot;);
	}
}
[/code]
okey the problem is... it doesnt erease the name out of the list...
so if someone can help me and make an unban then i will be happy :)
