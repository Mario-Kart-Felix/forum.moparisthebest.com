    <description>This will take a few pages this time because on the other forum it would just freeze your computer up, weird. But here goes.

*R.I.P. Kaitnieks forums, you will be sorely missed.*



Hello everyone. This is my newest SCAR tutorial. 


Ok today I&#39;m going to teach you most of what I know, or what I can remember. Today we will be learning about the following:

I.)What is SCAR?
II.)Program line
III.)begin
IV.)end.
V.) MoveMouse
VI.)MoveMouseSmooth
VII.)ClickMouse
VIII.)HoldMouse
IX.)ReleaseMouse
X.)Wait
XI.)SendKeys
XII.)SendKeysSilent
XIII.)repeating
XIV.)constants
XV.)variables
XVI.)Writeln
XVII.)Readln
XVIII.)findcolor
XIX.)procedures
XX.)includes
XXI.)comments
XXII.)Putting it all together[br][size=1]Posted at: March 27, 2006, 04:39:41 am[/size][hr]I.) What is SCAR?
SCAR is a scriptable macroing device made by Kaitnieks(whom some may refer to as &quot;CakeMix&quot;.) With this program you can 
do almost anything(on a computer, of course.)



II.)Program line
When you open up scar you will see three lines which say


[code]Program new;
begin
end.[/code]


The first line is the Program line and this is a requirement for all scripts. Some people choose not to make it, 
I&#39;m not sure if it makes a difference, but this line is basically the title of your script. For instance...


[code]Program AutoMiner;
begin
blahblahblah;
blahblah;
end.[/code]


This let&#39;s you know that it is in fact, an automining script. Cool, huh?



III.)begin
The second line when you open up scar says &quot;begin&quot;. This tells scar to do something. &quot;What does it do????&quot; 
you may say. I&#39;m going to tell you, right now. It tells SCAR to begin the script. It is a MUST for ALL scripts. 
There&#39;s not really too much explaining to this one, so I&#39;ll go ahead and move on to the next one.



IV.)end.
This is the third line you see when you open up SCAR. It is always the last line of every script. 
{Off Topic:  I really like using the bracket things..hehe} Once again, there&#39;s not much explaining to this one. 
Do not get this confused with the other end;   That just means that it is the end of the command or procedure. Moving on.



V.)MoveMouse
This function tells scar to move the mouse to the selected coordinates. The coordinates are in the bottom lefthand 
corner of your SCAR window. However, you don&#39;t see the mouse move there in this one, it just goes from one and then 
magically disappears and reappears in the coordinates you typed in. (Ex.)


[code]Program AutoMiner;
begin
MoveMouse(100,500);
end.[/code]


That would tell scar to move the mouse directly to the coordinates 100,500 . Easy enough.

{SideNote}:To know the coordinates of the certain window you must drag the crosshairs over to the window you want.[br][size=1]Posted at: March 27, 2006, 04:40:55 am[/size][hr]VI.)MoveMouseSmooth
This is about the same thing as the MoveMouse function, except it moves the mouse in a smooth way to the coordinates, 
as if a human were moving it. Not much explaining here, I explained it in the last part.



VII.)ClickMouse
Here we have the ClickMouse function. This will click the mouse! blashphemy, isn&#39;t it? There&#39;s another step to do when 
you&#39;re making the clickmouse part in the script though. It has to know if it needs to left click or to right click 
the mouse. Such as


[code]Program AutoMiner;
begin
MoveMouse(100,500);
ClickMouse(100,500,true);
end.[/code]


Ok, here we are telling it to move the mouse too to coords 100,500 then click on the coords 100,500. 
After the second comma it says true. That means it will left click on those coords. To make it right click, 
you would obviously set it to false. As in..ClickMouse(x,y,false);  Enough said.



VIII.)HoldMouse
This one i didn&#39;t figure out until not too long ago, it will make scar hold down the mouse, you might use something 
like this to drag an icon or something over to a different spot on your desktop, games like &quot;Spank the Monkey&quot;, etc. 
Here&#39;s how it works.


[code]Program Autominer;
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
end.[/code]

Once again, we put true in there so they know you use a left click to hold it. 
But this doesn&#39;t really make sence unless you want to release the mouse, of course. Which is in the next part.



VIX.)ReleaseMouse
Obviously used with the HoldMouse function, this releases the mouse so you let go of whatever you were holding or moving. 
Here&#39;s an example:


[code]Program Autominer;
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
end.[/code] 


Still using the true part. NEXT!



X.)Wait
Using Wait will make it wait, as to not make everything happen at once, because things can and will go wrong if you don&#39;t 
make it wait. This program uses milliseconds so you will have to convert the seconds you want to wait, and then convert it 
into milliseconds to write in there.


[code]Program Autominer;
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
Wait(1000);
end.[/code]


Tells it to do all that, and then wait 1 second.
[br][size=1]Posted at: March 27, 2006, 04:43:19 am[/size][hr]XI.)SendKeys
Here we have the SendKeys function. This is a favorite for autoing programs because it makes people less suspicious 
about you autoing if you&#39;re actually talking. An example may be:


XI.)SendKeys
Here we have the SendKeys function. This is a favorite for autoing programs because it makes people less suspicious 
about you autoing if you&#39;re actually talking. An example may be:


[code]Program Autominer;
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39;);
end.[/code]


That will do all of the above then type in that. The quotations make it so it types a sentence and not a command, 
think of it as SCAR quoting what you said then typing it in. There&#39;s only one problem. It doesn&#39;t hit enter just yet. 
So here&#39;s how we fix it. To the computer, enter is the 13th character on the keyboard. So to hit enter when you&#39;re wanting 
it to talk, an example would be..


[code]Program Autominer;
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39; + chr(13));
end.[/code]


Here it will say that, then hit enter for you so you&#39;re actually talking. For some odd reason, if you just wanted to 
hit enter and not say anything, the script would be like:


[code]Program HitEnter;
begin
SendKeys(chr(13));
end.[/code]



XII.)SendKeysSilent
aside from the normal SendKeys, this will send keys to the window you selected by dragging the crosshairs from SCAR 
on to that window. So even if you have other programs up, if you have it selected it will still say it to only that window 
and not the ones you have on top of it. I basically explained it in part XI, so I&#39;m going to move on. 



XIII.)repeating 
Another widely used command in SCAR is the repeat function. It is used to...well....repeat the script. However, this 
command can not work alone because SCAR won&#39;t know how long to repeat it, so you have to make it repeat until a certain 
thing happens. For instance...


[code]Program AutoMiner;
begin
repeat
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39; + chr(13));
until(false)
end.[/code]


the until(false); part of it tells it to repeat that script forever. You can make it repeat a script until a certain 
thing happens, which I&#39;ll probably explain later on in here.



XIV.)constants
constants are harder for me to explain. All I can say about them is that they&#39;re like a memory system for SCAR to use 
so you don&#39;t have to spend all that extra time typing. Cool huh. Here&#39;s how it works.


[code]Program AutoMiner;
const
Talk=&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39;;
begin
repeat
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
until(false)
end.[/code]


Easy isn&#39;t it, it just basically stores the information that telling it to Talk will tell it to say
&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39; .



XV.)variables
Variables are kind of like that too. They store numbers(as far as I know). I only know one kind of variable, which is 
integer variables. There are also boolean varirables, string variables, array variables, etc... but I have no clue as to 
how they work. So here&#39;s how integer variables work.
[br][size=1]Posted at: March 27, 2006, 04:46:48 am[/size][hr]XVI.)Writeln
Writeln is pretty cool, it do you see the bottom window in scar where when you push play it will say 
&quot;successfully compiled&quot; and &quot;successfully executed&quot; ? That&#39;s where it will appear. To use it in a script it would be 
something like..


[code]Program AutoMiner;
var
x,x2,y,y2: integer;
const
Talk=&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39;;
begin
x:=100;
y:=500;
x2:=500;
y2:=750;
Writeln(&#39;You are now using the Auto Miner.&#39;);
repeat
MoveMouseSmooth(x,y);
HoldMouse(x,y,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
until(false)
end.[/code]


It will make it say &quot;You are now using the Auto Miner.&quot; in the bottom window part. Brilliant!


XVII.)Readln
This here function will bring up a window asking the question you typed in for the Readln, like:

[code]Program AutoMiner;
var
x,x2,y,y2: integer;
const
Talk=&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39;;
begin
x:=100;
y:=500;
x2:=500;
y2:=750;
Writeln(&#39;You are now using the Auto Miner.&#39;);
Readln(&#39;Push ok to move on to the script.&#39;);
repeat
MoveMouseSmooth(x,y);
HoldMouse(x,y,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
until(false)
end.[/code]


If you haven&#39;t done this by now, go ahead and copy and paste the script we have been building into the SCAR window. 
It won&#39;t actually automining, it&#39;s just an example, but it works. Put it into SCAR, and hit run and 
you can see how it works.


XVIII.)FindColor
This is one of the more complicated parts to some of the beginners. This is a kinda algebra type thing, because it 
has if&#39;s and then&#39;s and or&#39;s , ETC. Kind of like:


[code]Program AutoMiner;
var
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;
const
Talk=&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39;;
begin
x1:=100;
y1:=500;
x2:=500;
y2:=750;
Writeln(&#39;You are now using the Auto Miner.&#39;);
Readln(&#39;Push ok to move on to the script.&#39;);
repeat
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
end;
until(false)
end.[/code]


Now I will explain how it works. In here I made new variable declarations, I changed the x and y variables to x1 and y1 
because FindColor needed x and y.  When you are using the FindColor function, you don&#39;t need to define x and y 
because it&#39;s saying if it finds the color of 564738 in between the coordinates of 0,0 and 500,500 then to do the rest 
of that script. The 564738 is the color, you can select the color that you need to get using the color picker, which 
is right beside the magnifying glass. the 0,0 and 500,500 are known as the xs,ys and xe,ye coordinates. 
To find these ....well i&#39;ll explain in picture form.

There, I&#39;m trying to explain it as easily as I can. If you still don&#39;t understand, XxKanexX has a tutorial on it 
somewhere on the forums, but come back soon because there&#39;s more to learn!



XIX.)procedures
I also have just started using these recently. They&#39;re very useful. They kind of relate to constants or variables 
because they&#39;re storing data, just a full script. Here is how they work.


[code]Program AutoMiner;
var
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;
const
Talk=&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39;;

procedure MineTheStuff;
begin
x1:=100;
y1:=500;
x2:=500;
y2:=750;
Writeln(&#39;You are now using the Auto Miner.&#39;);
Readln(&#39;Push ok to move on to the script.&#39;);
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
end;

begin
repeat
MineTheStuff;
until(false)
end.[/code]


These are for people who just like using them, or for very long scripts that use different variables for different things.
[br][size=1]Posted at: March 27, 2006, 04:51:45 am[/size][hr]XX.)includes
An include is a script with a bunch of procedures that has been premade and saved by a very generous person so you 
don&#39;t have to do all that writing yourself. To make SCAR use an include you would put {.include includename.txt} 
right after the program line. Like this:


[code]Program AutoMiner;
{.include Randoms.txt}
var
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;
const
Talk=&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39;;

procedure MineTheStuff;
begin
x1:=100;
y1:=500;
x2:=500;
y2:=750;
Writeln(&#39;You are now using the Auto Miner.&#39;);
Readln(&#39;Push ok to move on to the script.&#39;);
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
end;

begin
repeat
MineTheStuff;
RandomHandler
until(false)
end.[/code]


See how it works? It tells it that the include it&#39;s using&#39;s name is called &quot;Randoms&quot;. To my knowledge, Randoms is not 
an actual include, I made it up, so it won&#39;t actually work. But here is a script with a real include


[code]Program AutoMiner;
{.include Squig.txt}
var
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;
const
Talk=&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39;;

procedure MineTheStuff;
begin
x1:=100;
y1:=500;
x2:=500;
y2:=750;
Writeln(&#39;You are now using the Auto Miner.&#39;);
Readln(&#39;Push ok to move on to the script.&#39;);
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
end;

begin
setupsquig;
repeat
MineTheStuff;
until(false)
end.[/code]


Cool, isn&#39;t it? Thanks to whoever made up the idea for includes!



XXI.)comments
comments are things you put before, in the middle of(I wouldn&#39;t know why), or after the script. Most people put them 
before the script so you will notice them, but you know, whatever floats your boat.  :rolleyes: They go before the program 
line and to make them you can either put //then the message you want, which looks messy if you&#39;re making a lot of them. 
Most people use the //message part after the line that they want to explain. Another type is the {message} comment part. 
It&#39;s been made so you can say what you want to say without it interfering with the script. Putting your knowledge of 
all that you&#39;ve learned so far, along with these, could look like:

 

[code]{Hello, how are you doing, I&#39;d like to welcome you to my Auto Miner that isn&#39;t real =P}

Program AutoMiner;
{.include Squig.txt} //not to be confused with a comment, is has a   .  before it says include
var
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;
const
Talk=&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39;;

procedure MineTheStuff;
begin
x1:=100;
y1:=500;
x2:=500;
y2:=750;
Writeln(&#39;You are now using the Auto Miner.&#39;);
Readln(&#39;Push ok to move on to the script.&#39;);
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
end;
 //do you like how this is coming along? Are you learning it well?
begin
setupsquig;
repeat
MineTheStuff;
until(false)
end.[/code]



XXII.) Putting it all together

Ok here is your whole script.




[code]{Hello, how are you doing, I&#39;d like to welcome you to my Auto Miner that isn&#39;t real =P}
Program AutoMiner;
{.include Squig.txt} //not to be confused with a comment, is has a   .  before it says include
var
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;
const
Talk=&#39;Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?&#39;;

procedure MineTheStuff;
begin
x1:=100;
y1:=500;
x2:=500;
y2:=750;
Writeln(&#39;You are now using the Auto Miner.&#39;);
Readln(&#39;Push ok to move on to the script.&#39;);
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
end;
//do you like how this is coming along? Are you learning it well?
begin
setupsquig;
repeat
MineTheStuff;
until(false)
end.[/code]


Now you&#39;ve learned all I can teach you, atleast all that I think i can teach you with my bad memory, 
and you can put this all together to good use and make a great script and be noticed.  To learn more you can 
do what I did and what most people do, and learn from looking at other peoples&#39; scripts, and observe how they work. 
I hope you have a good stay at Mopar&#39;s forums, and I hope you liked my tutorial!! :)


ALSO, DON&#39;T FORGET THIS !!!!!!(look down)

I have taught you guys the most basic commands in SCAR scripting. The AutoMiner script we stuck with is not a real script,
it was there to show you how things work =D.  It has also recently been brought to my attention that the functions 
MoveMouse, MoveMouseSmooth, SendKeys, and SendKeysSilent are very detectable in RuneScape, so I wouldn&#39;t reccomend 
using them. Squig made a procedure in his include to make a function called SendKeysHuman that would type things
at a human-like speed. There is also MoveMouseSmoothEx which also moves it at a human-like speed.</description>

XXII.)Putting it all together[br][size=1]Posted at: March 27, 2006, 04:39:41 am[/size][hr]I.) What is SCAR?<br>
SCAR is a scriptable macroing device made by Kaitnieks(whom some may refer to as “CakeMix”.) With this program you can<br>
do almost anything(on a computer, of course.)</p>
<p>II.)Program line<br>
When you open up scar you will see three lines which say</p>
<p><code>Program new;
begin
end.</code></p>
<p>The first line is the Program line and this is a requirement for all scripts. Some people choose not to make it,<br>
I’m not sure if it makes a difference, but this line is basically the title of your script. For instance…</p>
<p><code>Program AutoMiner;
begin
blahblahblah;
blahblah;
end.</code></p>
<p>This let’s you know that it is in fact, an automining script. Cool, huh?</p>
<p>III.)begin<br>
The second line when you open up scar says “begin”. This tells scar to do something. “What does it do???”<br>
you may say. I’m going to tell you, right now. It tells SCAR to begin the script. It is a MUST for ALL scripts.<br>
There’s not really too much explaining to this one, so I’ll go ahead and move on to the next one.</p>
<p>IV.)end.<br>
This is the third line you see when you open up SCAR. It is always the last line of every script.<br>
{Off Topic:  I really like using the bracket things…hehe} Once again, there’s not much explaining to this one.<br>
Do not get this confused with the other end;   That just means that it is the end of the command or procedure. Moving on.</p>
<p>V.)MoveMouse<br>
This function tells scar to move the mouse to the selected coordinates. The coordinates are in the bottom lefthand<br>
corner of your SCAR window. However, you don’t see the mouse move there in this one, it just goes from one and then<br>
magically disappears and reappears in the coordinates you typed in. (Ex.)</p>
<p><code>Program AutoMiner;
begin
MoveMouse(100,500);
end.</code></p>
<p>That would tell scar to move the mouse directly to the coordinates 100,500 . Easy enough.</p>
<p>{SideNote}:To know the coordinates of the certain window you must drag the crosshairs over to the window you want.[br][size=1]Posted at: March 27, 2006, 04:40:55 am[/size][hr]VI.)MoveMouseSmooth<br>
This is about the same thing as the MoveMouse function, except it moves the mouse in a smooth way to the coordinates,<br>
as if a human were moving it. Not much explaining here, I explained it in the last part.</p>
<p>VII.)ClickMouse<br>
Here we have the ClickMouse function. This will click the mouse! blashphemy, isn’t it? There’s another step to do when<br>
you’re making the clickmouse part in the script though. It has to know if it needs to left click or to right click<br>
the mouse. Such as</p>
<p><code>Program AutoMiner;
begin
MoveMouse(100,500);
ClickMouse(100,500,true);
end.</code></p>
<p>Ok, here we are telling it to move the mouse too to coords 100,500 then click on the coords 100,500.<br>
After the second comma it says true. That means it will left click on those coords. To make it right click,<br>
you would obviously set it to false. As in…ClickMouse(x,y,false);  Enough said.</p>
<p>VIII.)HoldMouse<br>
This one i didn’t figure out until not too long ago, it will make scar hold down the mouse, you might use something<br>
like this to drag an icon or something over to a different spot on your desktop, games like “Spank the Monkey”, etc.<br>
Here’s how it works.</p>
<p><code>Program Autominer;
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
end.</code></p>
<p>Once again, we put true in there so they know you use a left click to hold it.<br>
But this doesn’t really make sence unless you want to release the mouse, of course. Which is in the next part.</p>
<p>VIX.)ReleaseMouse<br>
Obviously used with the HoldMouse function, this releases the mouse so you let go of whatever you were holding or moving.<br>
Here’s an example:</p>
<p><code>Program Autominer;
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
end.</code></p>
<p>Still using the true part. NEXT!</p>
<p>X.)Wait<br>
Using Wait will make it wait, as to not make everything happen at once, because things can and will go wrong if you don’t<br>
make it wait. This program uses milliseconds so you will have to convert the seconds you want to wait, and then convert it<br>
into milliseconds to write in there.</p>
<p><code>Program Autominer;
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
Wait(1000);
end.</code></p>
<p>Tells it to do all that, and then wait 1 second.<br>
[br][size=1]Posted at: March 27, 2006, 04:43:19 am[/size][hr]XI.)SendKeys<br>
Here we have the SendKeys function. This is a favorite for autoing programs because it makes people less suspicious<br>
about you autoing if you’re actually talking. An example may be:</p>
<p>XI.)SendKeys<br>
Here we have the SendKeys function. This is a favorite for autoing programs because it makes people less suspicious<br>
about you autoing if you’re actually talking. An example may be:</p>
<p><code>Program Autominer;
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys('Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?');
end.</code></p>
<p>That will do all of the above then type in that. The quotations make it so it types a sentence and not a command,<br>
think of it as SCAR quoting what you said then typing it in. There’s only one problem. It doesn’t hit enter just yet.<br>
So here’s how we fix it. To the computer, enter is the 13th character on the keyboard. So to hit enter when you’re wanting<br>
it to talk, an example would be…</p>
<p><code>Program Autominer;
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys('Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?' + chr(13));
end.</code></p>
<p>Here it will say that, then hit enter for you so you’re actually talking. For some odd reason, if you just wanted to<br>
hit enter and not say anything, the script would be like:</p>
<p><code>Program HitEnter;
begin
SendKeys(chr(13));
end.</code></p>
<p>XII.)SendKeysSilent<br>
aside from the normal SendKeys, this will send keys to the window you selected by dragging the crosshairs from SCAR<br>
on to that window. So even if you have other programs up, if you have it selected it will still say it to only that window<br>
and not the ones you have on top of it. I basically explained it in part XI, so I’m going to move on.</p>
<p>XIII.)repeating<br>
Another widely used command in SCAR is the repeat function. It is used to…well…repeat the script. However, this<br>
command can not work alone because SCAR won’t know how long to repeat it, so you have to make it repeat until a certain<br>
thing happens. For instance…</p>
<p><code>Program AutoMiner;
begin
repeat
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys('Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?' + chr(13));
until(false)
end.</code></p>
<p>the until(false); part of it tells it to repeat that script forever. You can make it repeat a script until a certain<br>
thing happens, which I’ll probably explain later on in here.</p>
<p>XIV.)constants<br>
constants are harder for me to explain. All I can say about them is that they’re like a memory system for SCAR to use<br>
so you don’t have to spend all that extra time typing. Cool huh. Here’s how it works.</p>
<p><code>Program AutoMiner;
const
Talk='Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?';
begin
repeat
MoveMouseSmooth(100,500);
HoldMouse(100,500,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(500,750);
ReleaseMouse(500,750,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
until(false)
end.</code></p>
<p>Easy isn’t it, it just basically stores the information that telling it to Talk will tell it to say<br>
‘Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?’ .</p>
<p>XV.)variables<br>
Variables are kind of like that too. They store numbers(as far as I know). I only know one kind of variable, which is<br>
integer variables. There are also boolean varirables, string variables, array variables, etc… but I have no clue as to<br>
how they work. So here’s how integer variables work.<br>
[br][size=1]Posted at: March 27, 2006, 04:46:48 am[/size][hr]XVI.)Writeln<br>
Writeln is pretty cool, it do you see the bottom window in scar where when you push play it will say<br>
“successfully compiled” and “successfully executed” ? That’s where it will appear. To use it in a script it would be<br>
something like…</p>
<p><code>Program AutoMiner;
var
x,x2,y,y2: integer;
const
Talk='Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?';
begin
x:=100;
y:=500;
x2:=500;
y2:=750;
Writeln('You are now using the Auto Miner.');
repeat
MoveMouseSmooth(x,y);
HoldMouse(x,y,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
until(false)
end.</code></p>
<p>It will make it say “You are now using the Auto Miner.” in the bottom window part. Brilliant!</p>
<p>XVII.)Readln<br>
This here function will bring up a window asking the question you typed in for the Readln, like:</p>
<p><code>Program AutoMiner;
var
x,x2,y,y2: integer;
const
Talk='Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?';
begin
x:=100;
y:=500;
x2:=500;
y2:=750;
Writeln('You are now using the Auto Miner.');
Readln('Push ok to move on to the script.');
repeat
MoveMouseSmooth(x,y);
HoldMouse(x,y,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
until(false)
end.</code></p>
<p>If you haven’t done this by now, go ahead and copy and paste the script we have been building into the SCAR window.<br>
It won’t actually automining, it’s just an example, but it works. Put it into SCAR, and hit run and<br>
you can see how it works.</p>
<p>XVIII.)FindColor<br>
This is one of the more complicated parts to some of the beginners. This is a kinda algebra type thing, because it<br>
has if’s and then’s and or’s , ETC. Kind of like:</p>
<p><code>Program AutoMiner;
var
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;
const
Talk='Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?';
begin
x1:=100;
y1:=500;
x2:=500;
y2:=750;
Writeln('You are now using the Auto Miner.');
Readln('Push ok to move on to the script.');
repeat
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then
begin
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);
Wait(1000);
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));
end;
until(false)
end.</code></p>
<p>Now I will explain how it works. In here I made new variable declarations, I changed the x and y variables to x1 and y1<br>
because FindColor needed x and y.  When you are using the FindColor function, you don’t need to define x and y<br>
because it’s saying if it finds the color of 564738 in between the coordinates of 0,0 and 500,500 then to do the rest<br>
of that script. The 564738 is the color, you can select the color that you need to get using the color picker, which<br>
is right beside the magnifying glass. the 0,0 and 500,500 are known as the xs,ys and xe,ye coordinates.<br>
To find these …well i’ll explain in picture form.</p>

<p>There, I’m trying to explain it as easily as I can. If you still don’t understand, XxKanexX has a tutorial on it<br>
somewhere on the forums, but come back soon because there’s more to learn!</p>
<p>XIX.)procedures<br>
I also have just started using these recently. They’re very useful. They kind of relate to constants or variables<br>
because they’re storing data, just a full script. Here is how they work.</p>
<p>[code]Program AutoMiner;<br>
var<br>
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;<br>
const<br>
Talk=‘Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?’;</p>
<p>procedure MineTheStuff;<br>
begin<br>
x1:=100;<br>
y1:=500;<br>
x2:=500;<br>
y2:=750;<br>
Writeln(‘You are now using the Auto Miner.’);<br>
Readln(‘Push ok to move on to the script.’);<br>
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then<br>
begin<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);<br>
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);<br>
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);<br>
Wait(1000);<br>
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin<br>
repeat<br>
MineTheStuff;<br>
until(false)<br>
end.[/code]</p>
<p>These are for people who just like using them, or for very long scripts that use different variables for different things.<br>
[br][size=1]Posted at: March 27, 2006, 04:51:45 am[/size][hr]XX.)includes<br>
An include is a script with a bunch of procedures that has been premade and saved by a very generous person so you<br>
don’t have to do all that writing yourself. To make SCAR use an include you would put {.include includename.txt}<br>
right after the program line. Like this:</p>
<p>[code]Program AutoMiner;<br>
{.include Randoms.txt}<br>
var<br>
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;<br>
const<br>
Talk=‘Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?’;</p>
<p>procedure MineTheStuff;<br>
begin<br>
x1:=100;<br>
y1:=500;<br>
x2:=500;<br>
y2:=750;<br>
Writeln(‘You are now using the Auto Miner.’);<br>
Readln(‘Push ok to move on to the script.’);<br>
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then<br>
begin<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);<br>
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);<br>
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);<br>
Wait(1000);<br>
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin<br>
repeat<br>
MineTheStuff;<br>
RandomHandler<br>
until(false)<br>
end.[/code]</p>
<p>See how it works? It tells it that the include it’s using’s name is called “Randoms”. To my knowledge, Randoms is not<br>
an actual include, I made it up, so it won’t actually work. But here is a script with a real include</p>
<p>[code]Program AutoMiner;<br>
{.include Squig.txt}<br>
var<br>
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;<br>
const<br>
Talk=‘Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?’;</p>
<p>procedure MineTheStuff;<br>
begin<br>
x1:=100;<br>
y1:=500;<br>
x2:=500;<br>
y2:=750;<br>
Writeln(‘You are now using the Auto Miner.’);<br>
Readln(‘Push ok to move on to the script.’);<br>
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then<br>
begin<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);<br>
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);<br>
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);<br>
Wait(1000);<br>
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin<br>
setupsquig;<br>
repeat<br>
MineTheStuff;<br>
until(false)<br>
end.[/code]</p>
<p>Cool, isn’t it? Thanks to whoever made up the idea for includes!</p>
<p>XXI.)comments<br>
comments are things you put before, in the middle of(I wouldn’t know why), or after the script. Most people put them<br>
before the script so you will notice them, but you know, whatever floats your boat.  :rolleyes: They go before the program<br>
line and to make them you can either put //then the message you want, which looks messy if you’re making a lot of them.<br>
Most people use the //message part after the line that they want to explain. Another type is the {message} comment part.<br>
It’s been made so you can say what you want to say without it interfering with the script. Putting your knowledge of<br>
all that you’ve learned so far, along with these, could look like:</p>
<p>[code]{Hello, how are you doing, I’d like to welcome you to my Auto Miner that isn’t real =P}</p>
<p>Program AutoMiner;<br>
{.include Squig.txt} //not to be confused with a comment, is has a   .  before it says include<br>
var<br>
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;<br>
const<br>
Talk=‘Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?’;</p>
<p>procedure MineTheStuff;<br>
begin<br>
x1:=100;<br>
y1:=500;<br>
x2:=500;<br>
y2:=750;<br>
Writeln(‘You are now using the Auto Miner.’);<br>
Readln(‘Push ok to move on to the script.’);<br>
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then<br>
begin<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);<br>
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);<br>
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);<br>
Wait(1000);<br>
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));<br>
end;<br>
//do you like how this is coming along? Are you learning it well?<br>
begin<br>
setupsquig;<br>
repeat<br>
MineTheStuff;<br>
until(false)<br>
end.[/code]</p>
<p>XXII.) Putting it all together</p>
<p>Ok here is your whole script.</p>
<p>[code]{Hello, how are you doing, I’d like to welcome you to my Auto Miner that isn’t real =P}<br>
Program AutoMiner;<br>
{.include Squig.txt} //not to be confused with a comment, is has a   .  before it says include<br>
var<br>
x,x1,x2,y,y1,y2: integer;<br>
const<br>
Talk=‘Hello, how are you doing on this fine day?’;</p>
<p>procedure MineTheStuff;<br>
begin<br>
x1:=100;<br>
y1:=500;<br>
x2:=500;<br>
y2:=750;<br>
Writeln(‘You are now using the Auto Miner.’);<br>
Readln(‘Push ok to move on to the script.’);<br>
if(FindColor(x,y,564738,0,0,500,500))then<br>
begin<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(x1,y1);<br>
HoldMouse(x1,y1,true);<br>
MoveMouseSmooth(x2,y2);<br>
ReleaseMouse(x2,y2,true);<br>
Wait(1000);<br>
SendKeys(Talk + chr(13));<br>
end;<br>
//do you like how this is coming along? Are you learning it well?<br>
begin<br>
setupsquig;<br>
repeat<br>
MineTheStuff;<br>
until(false)<br>
end.[/code]</p>
<p>Now you’ve learned all I can teach you, atleast all that I think i can teach you with my bad memory,<br>
and you can put this all together to good use and make a great script and be noticed.  To learn more you can<br>
do what I did and what most people do, and learn from looking at other peoples’ scripts, and observe how they work.<br>
I hope you have a good stay at Mopar’s forums, and I hope you liked my tutorial!! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>ALSO, DON’T FORGET THIS !!!(look down)</p>
<p>I have taught you guys the most basic commands in SCAR scripting. The AutoMiner script we stuck with is not a real script,<br>
it was there to show you how things work =D.  It has also recently been brought to my attention that the functions<br>
MoveMouse, MoveMouseSmooth, SendKeys, and SendKeysSilent are very detectable in RuneScape, so I wouldn’t reccomend<br>
using them. Squig made a procedure in his include to make a function called SendKeysHuman that would type things<br>
at a human-like speed. There is also MoveMouseSmoothEx which also moves it at a human-like speed.</p>
