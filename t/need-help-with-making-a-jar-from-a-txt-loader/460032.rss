    <title>Need help with making a .jar from a .txt loader</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-making-a-jar-from-a-txt-loader/460032</link>
    <description>Greetings,
Today I&#39;m supposed to say that I&#39;ve worked on 5 servers and I&#39;ve told to make a downloadable client for one of them.The loader they were using for thier webclient was a .txt file (full name loader1.txt).And I want to know that how can I jar it to make an .exe client.I can make an .jar from the classes but theres only one compiled .txt class.I had thier old classes but thier new client is updated and they made a .txt class which has all the content.Help will be appreciated.

Regards
