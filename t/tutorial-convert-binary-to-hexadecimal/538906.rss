    <title>[Tutorial] Convert binary to hexadecimal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-convert-binary-to-hexadecimal/538906</link>
    <description>Hexadecimal is base-16 notation, and is useful for representing binary numbers.

You can split a byte into two &quot;nybbles&quot;, and each nybble contains four bits. One nybble has the possible range of between 0 (0 + 0 + 0 + 0) and 15 (8 + 4 + 2 + 1). This gives each nybble 16 different combinations, making a base-16 system perfect for representing it as it is only one character.

Let&#39;s take the binary number 01100111. If we split this into the 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1 columns, we see that it makes (64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1) which is 111. To represent it as a hexadecimal character, we need to split it into two nybbles.

We now have 0110 and 0111. To start with, we take the rightmost nybble, 0111. We split it into the 8 4 2 1 columns and this nybble has a value of 7. In hexadecimal, 7 is represented as [b]7[/b]. We then take the next rightmost nybble, 0110, and split it the same way (into 8 4 2 1). This nybble has a value of 6, which is represented in Hexadecimal as 6. Therefore, 01100111 can be represented as 67 in hexadecimal.

Let&#39;s take a larger number, 01011111. This has a denary (decimal) value of 95. Let&#39;s split it into nybbles and get converting: 0101 and 1111. 1111 has a denary value of 15 when split into the 8 4 2 1 columns, which is represented in hexadecimal as F. 0101 has a denary value of 5 when split into the 8 4 2 1 columns and is represented in hexadecimal as 5. This means that 01011111 has a hexadecimal representation of 5F.

This is used more in theoretical computing rather than actual computing, but it can make code a bit cleaner if you are working with very long, constant integer values.</description>

<p>This same technique can be used to convert between any number system which is a multiple of base 2, for example binary (base 2) -&gt; octal (base 8) just involves splitting the binary string into groups of 3 bits (2^3 = 8). binary -&gt; base64 could be converted by grouping the binary bits into groups of 6 (2^6 = 64). Can be adapted to conversions not involving binary such as octal (8) -&gt; base64 (64) - which is just done by grouping two octal digits together.</p>

<p>Is there any way this technique can be applied to numbers that don’t have a prime factorization of 2? i.e base 37</p>

<p>Please explain to me why you’d need to manually convert a binary number into a hexadecimal number when all modern programming languages have the ability to do so? You wouldn’t need to. This is for people who wish to do it without the use of a computer (hence the theoretical).</p>

              <p>Hexadecimal is base-16 notation, and is useful for representing binary numbers.</p>
<p>You can split a byte into two “nybbles”, and each nybble contains four bits. One nybble has the possible range of between 0 (0 + 0 + 0 + 0) and 15 (8 + 4 + 2 + 1). This gives each nybble 16 different combinations, making a base-16 system perfect for representing it as it is only one character.</p>
<p>Let’s take the binary number 01100111. If we split this into the 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1 columns, we see that it makes (64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1) which is 111. To represent it as a hexadecimal character, we need to split it into two nybbles.</p>
<p>We now have 0110 and 0111. To start with, we take the rightmost nybble, 0111. We split it into the 8 4 2 1 columns and this nybble has a value of 7. In hexadecimal, 7 is represented as <span class="bbcode-b">7</span>. We then take the next rightmost nybble, 0110, and split it the same way (into 8 4 2 1). This nybble has a value of 6, which is represented in Hexadecimal as 6. Therefore, 01100111 can be represented as 67 in hexadecimal.</p>
<p>Let’s take a larger number, 01011111. This has a denary (decimal) value of 95. Let’s split it into nybbles and get converting: 0101 and 1111. 1111 has a denary value of 15 when split into the 8 4 2 1 columns, which is represented in hexadecimal as F. 0101 has a denary value of 5 when split into the 8 4 2 1 columns and is represented in hexadecimal as 5. This means that 01011111 has a hexadecimal representation of 5F.</p>
<p>This is used more in theoretical computing rather than actual computing, but it can make code a bit cleaner if you are working with very long, constant integer values.</p>
