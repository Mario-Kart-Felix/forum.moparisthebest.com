    <title>DNA, Fingerprints. Privacy?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dna-fingerprints-privacy/224159</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve been talking with some people and we discussed a national databank that stores DNA and fingerprints of all inhabitants of a country. Some of them started talking about privacy, and that this databank would ruin peoples privacy. Now, am I missing something or are they just paranoid idiots? I mean, their argument was that burglars and other criminals would be against it.

Tell me why such a databank would harm peoples privacy, because I don&#39;t see how it would.</description>

<p>That means I’d love to live in a house I built by myself from the wood that grows from the trees in the woods surrounding my house without another soul for miles.</p>
<p>Just feels like another part of that is taken away from me when they mention these data banks.</p>
