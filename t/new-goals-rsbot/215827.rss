    <title>New goals(RSbot)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-goals-rsbot/215827</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;ve been done with rs for over a month now and I&#39;ve decided to get 99 wc before the acc gets banned. So I&#39;m using RSbot and I&#39;ve started at level 63. I will post pics and logs. I usually will let the script run every day for about 6-8 hours. Seeing as it gets 5 loads of williows (130 logs) per 15 minutes I think it&#39;s possible to reach the goal within the time period of being banned. Currently my acc is still 63 wc so I will just post a pic when I get 70,80,90,95,99 if I do make it that far. I should get done some time around Sunday night reaching level 70-72 if my math is correct.

Script includes good anti randoms for many of the randoms. 

Other randoms
---------------
Anti ban random mouse

Anti ban chat - &quot;brb full&quot;,&quot;full load brb&quot;,&quot;ill brb&quot;

Anti ban player level checks

Anti ban changing 

Maybe this script will last me a while.

Randoms so far:1 - Failed [Had to use user input]</description>
