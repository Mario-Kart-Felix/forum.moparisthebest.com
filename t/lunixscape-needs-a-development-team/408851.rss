    <description>[size=14pt]Hi  ;D

[center]I need a team to help me make an rsps. I made the website but I need a team to make the server stuff.

 My idea was to make a server like Ritzscape. Ritzscape uses credits and you can buy all these cool customs. Some people hate servers with customs but they&#39;re not so bad..
I need [b]a server coder[/b],[b] a server client maker[/b], and [b]a server hoster[/b].   I already have the website :).

 Also you can get real money if you do this. 70% of the server profits go to the people who helps out. But don&#39;t get excited, people will only donate if it gets popular  :o

If you can do any of these, fill out a template and post it here :S

[u]Server Makers or Client Makers[/u]
Name:
Age:
MSN:
How much experience do you have:
Any previous work you can show me:
Any other stuff you wanna put in here?:

[u]Hoster[/u]

How long can you host per day:

Also need a GFX Dude :)

A little sample for me:

              <p>Yea, it totally seems like you are using people to make you a server. Then you get owner rights, and 30% of donations? You don’t even have a base source? Also what kind of website did you make?</p>
