    <title>Does anybody want to make a website with me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anybody-want-to-make-a-website-with-me/544179</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking to produce a sort of portfolio and was wondering if anybody wanted to develop, design it with me.

This will be responsive and it&#39;ll be done ground up. I don&#39;t want to use any frameworks. 
Trying to minimize all JavaScript but still maintaining a dynamic website. 

Prefer to work with a novice (or anybody interested) so that they can learn from this, I already am a good designer and am far capable of doing something this trivial on my own however I just need company and somebody to work help with design. This is still open for everybody. 

I don&#39;t need anybody doing php or anything of that crap because I&#39;m going to use rails to handle everything. 

It would be great if your motivated and active. 

Just message me if you want to make something with me. 

Edit:[b] I only use iMessage or Google hangout.[/b]</description>

You could reduce the clutter by switching some of the ng attributes by using custom elements to define behavior (obviously not entirely). It also gives the benefit of having reusable components in the case you want to define the same behavior elsewhere in your application.

Welcome to Moparscape, where you can ask for a support partner in a development thread, and our members will take it away from you! Screw your support partner, lets debate about Ruby!</p>

<p>It’s a hot topic in any website development forum you fudgeing goon. If you don’t have anything useful to say to the discussion then why bother saying it? You even asked a fudgeing question about Ruby in this thread. Absolute shit for brains some of you people.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, and this post was more useful, huh? Just because it’s a hot topic doesn’t mean people need to turn other people’s threads into talk about Ruby. If you want to talk about Ruby that bad, make a thread title, “Ruby Discussion”, and talk there. Not in everyone’s threads.</p>

<p>It’s a hot topic in any website development forum you fucking goon. If you don’t have anything useful to say to the discussion then why bother saying it? You even asked a fucking question about Ruby in this thread. Absolute shit for brains some of you people.</p>

<p>Fair enough. Have you given directives a try? You could reduce the clutter by switching some of the ng attributes by using custom elements to define behavior (obviously not entirely). It also gives the benefit of having reusable components in the case you want to define the same behavior elsewhere in your application. As for empty content, I’d think as long as you call your data source before the view is completely rendered you generally shouldn’t run into this issue (in this case, your controller should be calling this at compile time) unless the network is slow.</p>

<p>My mistake, the emphasis was primarily on performance and efficiency; the bandwidth comment was a bit misleading since it’s not really relevant. Anyway I’d encourage you to at least research and review the SPA model and how it relates to Angular, as you’ll gain a better understanding of how they are used together to provide a better user experience than the standard model.</p>

<p>You’re correct in saying it’s not the browser’s responsibility to populate content, however most modern browsers are powerful enough to do this out of box anyway. I disagree with trying to go the extra mile though to ensure content is delivered, with reliability you’re going to see a drop in performance when you want to scale. Think of how many times you would need to create your blocks of content for each page view and how much processing power is wasted trying to render the page each time. It’s painfully slow and redundant, which is just as bad as a broken page.</p>
<p>I think you’re missing the point of Angular and it’s underlying concepts, rather than creating an essay as to why their design works, I will link you to their wiki page to explain their design goals.</p>

<p>If you’re relying on the browser to parse initial content why not just dynamically create the DOM instead? Just my two cents.[/quote]</p>
<p>wat?</p>
<p>The browser’s only responsibility is to parse the DOM not populate your content… regardless if the script loads or not. AngularJS only injects these variables if the DOM has been loaded and the framework has been initialized. If you’re going to make a huge assumption that end-user has it disabled (which likely won’t happen), you probably shouldn’t be using a <em>JavaScript reliant</em> framework in the first place to serve your content…</p>

              <p>A dynamically created page is parsed before sent to the browser. I don’t think the browser should be performing the initial parse, only dynamic content afterward. If the script failed to load you wouldn’t see what’s expected. Plus it leaves an ugly view source page.</p>
<p>If you’re relying on the browser to parse initial content why not just dynamically create the DOM instead? Just my two cents.</p>

<p>I fail to see the point… how is that any different from any dynamically created page? If you expect your end-users to have it disabled, you should have a fallback static page to redirect to or a nice message reminding them it’s 2014 via the noscript tags.</p>
