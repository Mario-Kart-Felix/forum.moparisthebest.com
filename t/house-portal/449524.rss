    <description>what i&#39;m trying to do is when you click &quot;Go to your house&quot; it checks in the file &quot;Data/cfg/houses.cfg&quot; and if your name and coordinates are in that file it will teleport you to the coordinates that are next to your name. this is what the beggining will look like
[code]if(c.dialogueAction == 1041) {[/code]
I&#39;m sure I could figure out how to do it myself but it would take lots of time. and if you tell me how to do it I&#39;ll know how to do it forever
Rep++ if your help works thank you.</description>
