<p>Java is not a “hard program language”. The syntax is simple and there’s a giant amount of information online because of the amount of developers who know java. And being a musician and a developer I can tell you first hand that music can be pretty complex. And also Cruel Truth I never said I was stating any facts, I told Shock that he has no evidence to back up his statements and “generally” musicians that start at a younger age or better.</p>

<p>Yeah sure, but dont compare java with music. Java is a hard program language. And its totally impossible that children can say that they’re ‘Experienced’ in java. And i totally agree Cruel truth, they would understand the basics but not the advanced way of java. Thats for what im looking for. I need an EXPERIENCED Developer who knows how to program the Advanced way of java. The most children try to understand java,  but they are NOT able to do that. They will never understand java till they have reached an appropriate age. This would answer everything here.</p>
