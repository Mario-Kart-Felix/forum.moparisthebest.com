    <title>Anyone know whats happening with RiD?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-know-whats-happening-with-rid/419666</link>
    <description>The sites been down all day. I know they were getting DDoSed yesterday and they came back, and RiD also mentioned that they were going to do a update for the site but this seems like a ridiculous time and I need to get on the site to download the latest bot so I can finish a text alert program I made in java in-case the bot crashes. Are they getting hit with another DDoS?</description>

<p>it uses advanced colour clicking algorithms which making it pretty successful at botting, I used to use it a lot on my <em>legit</em> pures so they didn’t get banned. highest level i got was a 89 in ranged.</p>

O, so its kind of like RiD? But free?<br>
Also, I’d think I have to create my own scripts right? Or are they released somewhere, etc.</p>
