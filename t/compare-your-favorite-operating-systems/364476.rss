    <description>[size=8pt]We don&#39;t have to show off pictures or anything fancy, just typing is necessary.[/size]

LINUX

I actually enjoy updating and modding the old 2001 model of novel&#39;s Open SUSE source. We have plenty of old and new Novel shit just laying around, so i mod and play around with it a couple of times when i&#39;m bored, it&#39;s basically the only thing i can focus my attention on for over 24 hours without blinking. My specific favorite linux server however is also a SUSE, SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 9 NOVEL is the full title of the case in which 4 cds containing no less than 261mb of data for the entire OS to be installed. I mod around with it when i have the chance on vmware&#39;s newest workstation software, but i really don&#39;t do that much other than update it and the drivers.

WINDOWS

I like to also play around with older versions of windows, i so far have an incredibly modded version of microsoft&#39;s windows NT (of course for private use, just don&#39;t tell microsoft ;) ). Then there is XP which is my main source of joy in life, i don&#39;t mod it much, aside from a few msstyles and some patches here and there.

I also have a few other systems i mess around with, including some old mac systems, windows 1.0 and 3.1, i also have managed to get me a copy of windows longhorn but after about 3 days or so the copy became corrupt due to the nature i acquired it.


And remember kids, don&#39;t download pirated operating systems as your main OS, it&#39;s a ton of bullshit full of Trojans and malware. Of course you know it all bastards probably already know that so why don&#39;t you just go correct me on this instead.</description>
