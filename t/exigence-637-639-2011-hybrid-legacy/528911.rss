Revision 637


Note: This server has been developing undercover for some time, it is not a blank project.



Information:


&lt;blockquote&gt;Exigence has always been and always will be a pking server. Our servers have been around for a while now and have been solely based around the idea of pking. Most servers strive for pking but don&#39;t know how to push for it without adding any kind of spawning system. Exigence has always been and will be spawn free and our unique economy is revolved around player-killing and PvMing in the deep wilderness. 

Our mission for this server is to bring back the fun pking experiences people had on private servers long ago. By sticking with a fun revision, but adding our own twists it will be a perfect fit for our targeted players. With contacts through pk clans, teams and youtube that ran and still run through different servers and runescape today, we think players won&#39;t be a problem for us. We plan on targeting players that mainly love to player kill and to be more specific hybrid. But, we also like to target the Pvmer&#39;s and skillers which will have a special feature set in our economy.

Without having anything to do with spawning, this server will revolve around a unique economy. On start up, players will be given a cash starter as well as a few welfare sets to get them started. A Barrows shop will be available for the first couple of days which will sell the pieces for a mediocre amount where players can start achieving their max sets. Pking is a major part of the server. Welfare sets won&#39;t be as expensive and will be easier to obtain (mystic gear). Max sets will be a little bit harder but won&#39;t take ages to get. However, items like dragon claws and along those lines won&#39;t be so easy to obtain. Pking will offer a substantial way to make money because the target system will award players for killing their targets. Random cash drops will be given and put inside your inventory, and you will be rewarded with PK points on a given kill.

PvMing will be an important aspect. Many types of NPC&#39;s will be incorporated into our server where players will have to PvM not only in safe zones, but even in the wilderness! Bosses such as Bork will be placed deep in the wilderness that will drop high valued items. 

Skilling will also be an important part of the server. Still on the table for discussion, but skill points and rewards for skilling will be given out to players that choose to skill on the server.&lt;/blockquote&gt;



Update Log:



&lt;blockquote&gt;8/25/13
 Bug Fixes/Background Added
 Most doors open
 Added in bounty hunter and ep system from older verison

8/26/13
Donator ranks and ability&#39;s that only donators can do (e.g wear certain items, yell, set loyalty titles + more)
Donator ranks are done with rights and made it so they can do :: for commands and don&#39;t have to use the developer console ( client sided )
Made a quick way to change the client ip in like 5 seconds ( not really a useful update but yeah )
Added corporeal beast and improved nex
Added highest killstreak, current killstreak (both saving and buffering correctly)
Added pk points along with total kills and deaths
Fixed the bug where if you switch gear while running you stop running ( now you will continue running / walking if you switch gear )
Fixed the bug where you could autocast with magic and use gmaul special attack and it would hit like 50 numbers at once
Opening of all doors are fine
Added custom interface in the achievements tab showing pkp, total kills, currently slaying, and amount left to say and some information for the player
Added wolpertinger, spirit terrorbird, obsidian golem, wartortoise, bullant familiars
Added server messages, fixed the dropping bug ( Wildskillers tutorial )
Added a 10 second pj timer to prevent players pjing eachother immediately after someone gets killed
Added the ability to achieve mobilising army titles depending on the amount of kills you get
Added full revenant caves with the entrance and exit to the cave along with the correct definitions of the revenants ( adding the drops real soon )
Fixed the bug where npcs could hit through walls and so could players hit through walls, ( clipping of this has been fixed )
Added the guthix npc (that mager), added, necrolord, kalphite queen of both the stages, elite npc
Implemented 100% character designing/ Saving of Character design
fixed tons of glitched equipment, helmets &amp; platebodies (some helmets were glitched like your hair would stick out from sides due to char design and platebodies were fuzzy)
8/27/13
Added damage soaking along with the gui in itemdefeditor edited to allow me to edit soaking bonuses ( these are set for a bunch of armours, i will add soaking bonuses to more items if it needs to as i go along but i think i have done most of them )
Added damage poisoning against players ( daggers with p will hit less than daggers with p+ and p++, the poisoning amounts are realistic )
Added damage poisoning against npcs, now the npcs will get poisoned too if you use a poisoned weapon on them
Added fully-working Sanfew Serums&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Added barrows with barrows tunnel and fixed the bug where the barrows npcs will spawn but you can't attack them once you killed them in the tunnel
Added slayer reward which you can learn to make slayer helmet and fletch broad bolts along with the rewards you can buy ( like broad bolts and runes etc )
Finished donator ranks with donator symbols done in the client and added a yell system also added more donator benefits
Fixed the bug where when you view equipment stats, you couldn't equip any items, you could only remove them
Added some missing mapdata, north magebank and rock crabs will no longer null you out. Ice plateau doesn't null you out either.
Fixed up the king black dragon npc, it was too easy before
Added pouch creation for summoning using the obelisk
Added a bounty hunter system. Been tested for every possible way it can to be tested for bugs, all tests came out negative ( meaning there are no bugs ) and the arrows are correct along with the likelihood configs
Made it so when there is a familiar over a player, the player will show instead of the npc and the player hid under it ( this helps bridders as they won't have to right click when familiar walk over opponents )</code></p>

A Barrows shop will be available for the first couple of days which will sell the pieces for a mediocre amount where players can start achieving their max sets. Pking is a major part of the server. Welfare sets won’t be as expensive and will be easier to obtain (mystic gear). Max sets will be a little bit harder but won’t take ages to get. However, items like dragon claws and along those lines won’t be so easy to obtain. Pking will offer a substantial way to make money because the target system will award players for killing their targets. Random cash drops will be given and put inside your inventory, and you will be rewarded with PK points on a given kill.</p>
<p>PvMing will be an important aspect. Many types of NPC’s will be incorporated into our server where players will have to PvM not only in safe zones, but even in the wilderness! Bosses such as Bork will be placed deep in the wilderness that will drop high valued items.</p>
<p>Skilling will also be an important part of the server. Still on the table for discussion, but skill points and rewards for skilling will be given out to players that choose to skill on the server.</p>

8/26/13
Donator ranks and ability's that only donators can do (e.g wear certain items, yell, set loyalty titles + more)
Donator ranks are done with rights and made it so they can do :: for commands and don't have to use the developer console ( client sided )
Made a quick way to change the client ip in like 5 seconds ( not really a useful update but yeah )
Added corporeal beast and improved nex
Added highest killstreak, current killstreak (both saving and buffering correctly)
Added pk points along with total kills and deaths
Fixed the bug where if you switch gear while running you stop running ( now you will continue running / walking if you switch gear )
Fixed the bug where you could autocast with magic and use gmaul special attack and it would hit like 50 numbers at once
Opening of all doors are fine
Added custom interface in the achievements tab showing pkp, total kills, currently slaying, and amount left to say and some information for the player
Added wolpertinger, spirit terrorbird, obsidian golem, wartortoise, bullant familiars

Added a 10 second pj timer to prevent players pjing eachother immediately after someone gets killed
Added the ability to achieve mobilising army titles depending on the amount of kills you get
Added full revenant caves with the entrance and exit to the cave along with the correct definitions of the revenants ( adding the drops real soon )
Fixed the bug where npcs could hit through walls and so could players hit through walls, ( clipping of this has been fixed )

8/27/13
Added damage soaking along with the gui in itemdefeditor edited to allow me to edit soaking bonuses ( these are set for a bunch of armours, i will add soaking bonuses to more items if it needs to as i go along but i think i have done most of them )
Added damage poisoning against players ( daggers with p will hit less than daggers with p+ and p++, the poisoning amounts are realistic )
Added damage poisoning against npcs, now the npcs will get poisoned too if you use a poisoned weapon on them
