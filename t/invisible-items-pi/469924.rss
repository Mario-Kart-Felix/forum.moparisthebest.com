here are my int&#39;s

[code]        case 2:
    itemDef.modelid = 20003;
    itemDef.name = &quot;@blu@Torva platebody&quot;;
    itemDef.description = &quot;Torva Platebody.&quot;;
    itemDef.modelZoom = 1513;
    itemDef.modelRotationY = 566;
    itemDef.modelRotationX = 0;
    itemDef.modelOffset1 = 1;
    itemDef.modelOffset2 = -8;
    itemDef.anInt165 = 20002;
    itemDef.anInt200 = 20002;
    itemDef.groundActions = new String[5];
    itemDef.groundActions[2] = &quot;Take&quot;;
    itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
    itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
    itemDef.itemActions[2] = &quot;Check-charges&quot;;
    itemDef.itemActions[4] = &quot;Drop&quot;;
break;[/code]

can someone tell me what is wrong..the normal torva works fine..and i only changed the colors...

the only reason i posted this here..(assuming its client sided) is because the client help section doesn&#39;t seem to know whats wrong or won&#39;t help me. please give me some help community?</description>
