<p>A lot of people know what is happening in your country, a lot of people know about the war that still goes on and the problems you face. That does not mean, however, that we feel the same way about it as you do. Patriotism effects each of us differently, and we feel more strongly toward our own country then others which is why those who have watched this video will not be moved. It is a tale of a boy who was saved because of trust, to them that is all it was although to you it was so much more.</p>

<p>Amy, I’m sorry to say but this has as much meaning and importance to every race of people as it does to the Muslim faith.</p>
