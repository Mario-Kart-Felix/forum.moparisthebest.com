              <p>[quote=“amy_webb, post:21, topic:525147”]I understand the Muslim religion and how they trust one another, i do. However, i cannot agree with the fact that you said it would change the life of those who watch it. We come from different background and understand different values, it would be ignorant to say this will effect us all the same. Those who follow religions such as Christianity or no religion at all do not have the same faith or trust in those of the same religion as those who are Muslim do.</p>
<p>A lot of people know what is happening in your country, a lot of people know about the war that still goes on and the problems you face. That does not mean, however, that we feel the same way about it as you do. Patriotism effects each of us differently, and we feel more strongly toward our own country then others which is why those who have watched this video will not be moved. It is a tale of a boy who was saved because of trust, to them that is all it was although to you it was so much more.[/quote]</p>
<p>Amy, I’m sorry to say but this has as much meaning and importance to every race of people as it does to the Muslim faith.</p>
