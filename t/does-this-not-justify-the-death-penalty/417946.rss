<p>Would it not be a greater and harsher punishment to put such offenders in prisons and make them work for the rest of their lives? If they want a meal at the end of the day they have to work and pay for it (Obviously they work within the prisons. Knowing you are here for the rest of your life is a definate punishment.</p>
<p>In an idealised world then the inmates could be taught and eventually brought back into society. But only if they pass all relevant tests within the prison to make sure that their mental state and what not is in order.</p>

<p>Agreed, many of the problems lie with the government of these countries trying to keep the people oppressed. Much aid that we do give to impoverished countries never reaches to people. But you guys want the US to keep to their own business and not interfere with other countries so the US shouldn’t worry about it (not that I wouldn’t want to do this anyway because it would put our economy in a much worse state spending more of foreign aid).[/quote]<br>
Do you know why foreign aid doesn’t work?<br>
Because imperialist countries get 6 times the money back because of illegitimate loans in the past.</p>

How do you execute someone by an accident or self-defense?[/quote]<br>
Where did I say ‘execute’?  I clearly said ‘kill’, and you should be able to see how you could kill someone accidentally or in self-defense, right?</p>

              <p>This isn’t a problem restricted to Africa or third world countries, the same journalist did an investigation in the UK to find that it also occurs there. Poverty might make you steal but I don’t think it will push you to commit such horrible acts.</p>
<p>The problem I see here, is the superstitious belief in black magic etc. Religions long ago executed people for committing black magic, whether it involves murder or not. Whilst these practises have largely withdrawn from society, there is a real possibility that it may return to popular culture as it is already.</p>

<p>Second we should encourage them to build up their own corporations, and NOT let rich multinational corporation exploit their country. And encourage them to have strict control of their own natural resources. The best would be to let state owned corporations dig up the valuables, and use the money to build the country.</p>
<p>Third: We can delete debt that never should had been given. (Pocket money for dictators). And if we give them new loans or aid, it must be on their premise, not ours. (Not force them to become our prostitute).</p>
<p>Fourth: Remove embargo against Cuba and other countries.</p>
<p>Fifth: Prioritize getting them out of poverty and give them a better life, and not on removing all those dictators we don’t like.</p>
<p>The first world got rich by exploiting the rest, it is time to fix the problem. Poverty is very often the reasons for crimes, death penalty have no effect there.</p>
