    <title>Distractions and Diversions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/distractions-and-diversions/548789</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, recently I was working on a Champion distraction event to add some more content to my source. While doing that I was thinking of developing all (or the majority) of the different Distractions and Diversions RuneScape originally offered.

This thread will be updated periodically to include when I finish a new D&amp;D, so please continue to check up on it.

Once finished all these D&amp;D will be released for use. 

D&amp;D 1: Penguins
Release: [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,667641.msg4465161.html#msg4465161]https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,667641.msg4465161.html#msg4465161[/url]

D&amp;D 2: Champions&#39; Event
Release: N/A
Media: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPI1EcVGPw0]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPI1EcVGPw0[/url]

With the completion of the Champions&#39; event, the next D&amp;D I am working on is:

[code]Ancient effigies were released on 15 June 2010. These require randomly selected non-combat skills (levels ranging from 91 to 97) to restore, rewarding a significant amount of experience in the skills used and a Dragonkin Lamp upon full completion of the effigy.
They do not require any specific levels to receive as a drop, and the assist system can be used if players do not have the required level in either of the two skills the Effigy requires. Each stage of the effigy has two different skills which can be used before passing onto the next stage.

There are four stages of effigies; each stage offers a choice of two skills at a given level to unlock it.[/code]</description>

<p>Not sure if it took this long, or rather no one wanted to release it. I know I’ve used them in my servers for quite some time but just now wanted to release it for more people to use.</p>
