[size=14pt]More About Our Server...[/size]
Our server in progress is a top notch PVP server. Let me take you through it from the start. When you first start the server, you will set your skills, maybe read the rules, buy your gear, and go the the PVP battleground of your choice. There is Safepk and DangerPK. In SafePk you will fight with other people not for gear, but for score. Your score goes up with every kill and down with every death. When you kill someone, the points that you receive depend on the level of your opponents. Let&#39;s say that you set your skills to range, go buy range gear, kill a couple people, and get bored of ranging. Well you can easily reset your skills in your quest tab. Let&#39;s say your melee now and you want to risk it all to gain other people&#39;s gear. (gear does cost) You would go to dangerpk where you can loose everything (except for 3(unless your skulled)) or gain everything. In DangerPk there will be no running (or in SafePK) and you cant teleport in combat. You will have to face your fears. You will be able to buy everything you want, the best of items (with a few exceptions for donations) for 1 million gp a piece. You will start the game off with 25 million. To make money kill other people.

I have a lot of experience with managing servers, I’ve been every position you can think of, except a developer. I will be active, helpful, consistent, fair and much more, which will be a great help to the server, forums, and the community. I will be able to watch over the community and make sure that everybody is having a good time playing the server, and that rule-breakers are seen to and punished. I will be fair though, and I will never be biased. The server will be the first thing I go to when I come on my laptop, and the last thing I visit before I turn it off. I don’t know what else to say, however if you would like to know more then please contact me on MSN so that we may speak in further detail.</p>
<p>Thanks.[/center]</p>

Why do you think that your the man for the job? Well I have worked with 2 big name servers platchscape and reenscape. I worked on both of the clients for most of my time helping them. I’m good at advertising and getting the name out there. I’m good with people but follow rules and keep them in line</p>

              <p>@ abdullah<br>
I am a very strong programmer. I would be fine joining your team but first I would like to let you know that I spent over 7 months (yes 7 months of coding not of pretending to do stuff) building a 508 into an insane server. I have basically done the following: (to the best that I can remember… there are tons…)</p>
<p>Perfected mining and woodcutting (Your character looks at the rock while he mines it and time/lvl/pick calculations. as well as rock/tree depletion and replacement)</p>
<p>Construction… Legit. You can do everything u can in real rs. (I would just have to show u…)</p>
<p>The usual. (Fletching. Firemaking. Runecrafting (with multiple and combo runes) and all those gay skills)</p>
<p>Hunter… Yes I did make hunter just like rs. (Place trap wait for chin to approach. Chin attacks. You catch him. Bleep bleep.</p>
<p>Flood protection. (this one took like literally 3 and 1/2 minutes… Don’t know why every1 is scared of it…)</p>
<p>pvp points… nothing new.</p>
<p>Grand exchange. (Not credited by me tbh. I got the base code from mithscape and had to basically port it over… But I did make huge changes to it(Define huge))</p>
<p>Fishing… (Fishes are caught based on level and difficulty)</p>
<p>Farming… (different plants take different times(potatos take like 8 seconds and trees take like 27 minutes) (and you CAN watch them grow through all of the like 8-9 stages) (and you are alarmed when the growth is finished.) (But I was to lazy to make loots so once they grow u pick them for cash rofl.))</p>
<p>Smithing… (I hate this skill because I removed bronze in my server to add things like dragon plate and full helm. (So I planed on shifting everything down and at higher lvls u make dragon or somtin))</p>
<p>Combat… (I fixed lvl + armor + weapon calculation to match runescape. (Also I ddnt effing do everything with if-statements. I is not stoopid!) (I fixed the combat to better fit game ticks. Everyone else had dagger and bandos godsword slash at the same speed…))</p>
<p>Npc clipping… (this one was tricky and gay. Took me like 1 1/2 hours to code it. And like another 3 hours to store every location that is clipped.) (508 clipping in real rs is server side and so is mine. But you have to go to every location u want clipped and type ::cl (if ur admin) or ::cd (to delete clip)) (The clips are stored as a matrix. and only the stores clips are tested and stores. So it only takes like 1 megabyte of ram and no cpu. Its awesome and I have not seen another server even attempt that :] )</p>
<p>Player following/attacking player clipping follows the same lines as the last one.</p>
<p>(p.s. If ur wondering what about clipping in the rest of the game… Just wanted to say… Thats client side. I don’t need to do that. But U can do periodic checks to see if some1 is hacking clipping though =] )</p>
<p>Magic. (I added every single magic skill. And effing sound(the correct sounds) to every one) Barrages barrage like rs and sht</p>
<p>Sound. I added a crap load of sounds to actions. (equip armor. Different weapon sounds. Whip. daggers. maces. scimis. flail. bgs. magic attacks. bows. knives. ect)</p>
<p>Doors. I coded doors to open and close and removed it like a day later. It worked but why not just remove doors… Thats what I did atleast. Removed them.</p>
<p>Fixed object re-creation. 508 has a problem with spawning global objects in wrong loations… I fixed that problem.</p>
<p>Now I am gonna be straight. I HAVE NOT FIXED THE NPC BUG. (The whole reason I got pissed at the server and stopped coding!) The bug that seems to at random when too many npcs are on the client at once. The client crashes with an error… Ld client. Hd client. anyclient. So I know it is a server sending something wrong but I can’t place my finger on where.</p>
<p>HD and Fullscreen. Yes I added hd and full screen and a runescape music player</p>
<p>Anyways, There is more but I am boring myself and ur probly not even gonna respond nor is this community generally serious about any project (with exception to a few). My point is that I myself coded all of those and plenty more on a 508 so I am capable. I am looking for a partner with good programming skills and maybe his own server that we can merge. Basically, I would like to merge our servers together and create something bigger than we could have done alone. But my requirement is that every member of a certain spot gets equal as every other member. (unless they obviously did less) That means NO lead programmer. Tasks are discussed across all programmers and separated and completed. Every dollar earned over $75 monthly gets separated into every persons wage. With no single person making all the dough.</p>
<p>Would like to discuss. Might end up creating a team if u refuse. Anyways, cheers. Btw I am 19, in USA, The name: Louis a.k.a. halolouie.</p>

<p>[size=14pt]More About Our Server…[/size]<br>
Our server in progress is a top notch PVP server. Let me take you through it from the start. When you first start the server, you will set your skills, maybe read the rules, buy your gear, and go the the PVP battleground of your choice. There is Safepk and DangerPK. In SafePk you will fight with other people not for gear, but for score. Your score goes up with every kill and down with every death. When you kill someone, the points that you receive depend on the level of your opponents. Let’s say that you set your skills to range, go buy range gear, kill a couple people, and get bored of ranging. Well you can easily reset your skills in your quest tab. Let’s say your melee now and you want to risk it all to gain other people’s gear. (gear does cost) You would go to dangerpk where you can loose everything (except for 3(unless your skulled)) or gain everything. In DangerPk there will be no running (or in SafePK) and you cant teleport in combat. You will have to face your fears. You will be able to buy everything you want, the best of items (with a few exceptions for donations) for 1 million gp a piece. You will start the game off with 25 million. To make money kill other people.</p>
