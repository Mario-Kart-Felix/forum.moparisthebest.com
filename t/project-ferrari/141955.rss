Hello all! I have not been here in a long time... but I&#39;de like to announce the launch of my newest project... Project Ferrari! We need your support! I&#39;m glad to say that its coming from scratch (Winter Loves Source), so nothing is leached. But this is the begining of a great new Source and server, witch uses Silabsoft&#39;s Client, so it has skill capes the new items from Silabsoft, and is kept up to date. On making this me and my team are going to accomplish alot of things, we want most of everything working, while starting from a source that has absolutly nothing working, and make it as fun as runescape, but better. with all working skills, customized areas, and a good economy! so not everyone has all level 99, and full dragon, you got to work for it. and by the way, there will be NO COMMANDS, but some for teleporting, only if we cant get the portal chanber in.

- Skill capes (creds go to Silabsoft)
- new items (creds go to Silabsfot)

<p>I know basic HTML. I’m don’t know anything fancy, but I could do a little bit of coding for the website. I have Dreamweaver MX 2004 on my computer that works pretty good, too. That’s what I usually use.</p>
