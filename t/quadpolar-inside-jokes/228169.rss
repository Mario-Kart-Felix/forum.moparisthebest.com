    <title>Quadpolar? (inside jokes)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quadpolar-inside-jokes/228169</link>
    <description>Lol, so a year or two ago, my and my best friend noticed that our other friend is sort of... well, he can come off sort of bipolar sometimes. some people use this word too loosely. But i really think he was some sort of bipolar. But he would be more than bipolar at times, or what it seemed. Sometimes he would be a totally different person and change his personality. And other times he was just really emotional. Idk, so we called him quadpolar and its been an inside joke ever since. 

Any of you ever had some inside joke with a friend about your other friends?</description>

You know, some people on this forum <span class="bbcode-i">are</span> bipolar, right? Also, you’re a fucking idiot, bipolar has nothing to do with multiple personalities, but I’m sure genes make you too fucking retarded to understand that.</p>
<p>This is why I’m anti-inbreeding…<br>
[/quote]ohhhh io9. You must have not understood, the whole thing is really a joke. An inside joke. I mentioned in there that bi-polar was used loosely, and i was only going along with those definitions. I am aware that some of what i said has nothing to do with the actual “bi-polar” every one of you have taken so seriously to mention to me. I said it was an inside joke that me and my friends use <span class="bbcode-b">as a JOKE</span> on my <span class="bbcode-b">FRIEND</span> and not the literal term of bi-polar. I didn’t mean to offend anyone with bi-polar or whatever you mistake me of doing. The point of the thread was for people to post an inside joke. You however feel the need to insult me because i mistook the word bi-polar for its literal term and used it in a joke. <span class="bbcode-i">But I’m sure genes make you too fucking retarded to understand that.</span> meh, maybe its because you’re “anti-inbreeding”.[/quote]GTFO</p>
<p>Some illnesses aren’t ment to be made as a “inside joke” as you call it. I’ts not funny nor will it ever be.</p>
<p>Fuck off</p>

<p>It’s called Menopause. But yeah, me and my friends have like a new inside joke every week. Like We made up this name for a kid, the name was Randall, and we always say to each other, “Quit the shenanigans.” Or something to that effect. We also have an obsession with Geico commercials. We watch them a lot, or quote them. Another is Final Destination. And like, these are my friends from church, so we say stuff like. “You’re going to Hell.” Just like sarcastically, but with a funny accent.

<p>No, she actually is bi-polar. She even has a prescription for some meds, but she doesn’t take them. She basically gets drunk all day. Majority of the time it’s fine, but when she has her little episodes holy shit. She sure loves throwing sharp objects…</p>
<p>And she has some weird manic episodes too. Sometimes does the laugh too.</p>
