    <title>525 running problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/525-running-problem/302382</link>
    <description>So i am starting a 525 server, and this keeps coming up, it&#39;s disallowing me to access, but with other sources, i can. Please note this is my first time working with this version of server, just simply help me if you can/wish, and i&#39;m going to be fine.

Here&#39;s the problem

[code][2009/09/14 18:28:52] [AnonymousIoService-1]: New session from: /(MY IP ADDRESS):2515
[2009/09/14 18:28:52] [AnonymousIoService-1]: Session has been closed: /(MY IP ADDRESS):2515[/code]

So basically what i see is that it&#39;s denying me from accessing it, yet the server is running, and the client server status says it&#39;s online, although this happens. It&#39;s not liek it always happens, i can connect to some, but sometimes this pops up, any help or ideas.</description>

<p>Did you code that server? If not i recommend you use the other sources you used that works, because 508s are pretty hard to code unless your really good at j coding.</p>

[/quote] I would really agree with that, if i were you i would start with a 317 first, like me, learn some basic coding and THAN start a 525, but thats my say, do whatever you want, im only givin advice[/quote]</p>
<p>Your both idiots… this is 525 not fucking 508… Learn to read the topic name before you post shit…</p>
<p>i would suggest my idea that i told you in msn… even though its probably not right its advice</p>

              <p>It’s a cleaned source, i really don’t feel like removing shit the creators of the source added on the sources that let me connect, and for anyone that thinks this is a port forwarding or connection error it’s not, if you don’t know what it is don’t post fucking nonsense. Plus zane02, as mentioned in the title and in the beginning paragraph, it’s a 525, not a 508.</p>
<p>EDIT : I’m not a beginner, i’m creating a 525 because I am moving up in the “generation,” of private servers.</p>
