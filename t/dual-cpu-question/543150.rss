    <title>Dual cpu question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dual-cpu-question/543150</link>
    <description>I am planning on saving up money to build &quot;my gaming computer&quot;

I have been going through various motherboards trying to figure out exactly what I wish to use and I think I am going to use this

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131817&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=&amp;AID=10446076&amp;PID=3938566&amp;SID=

However, my questions are these:

1. what type of cpu cooler system would be suggested for best efficiency with something like this?
2. In theory, if I was to purchase 2 x 2011 12 core xeon cpu, I would literally have a 24 core system? 0_o... what concerns would i need to add into from this? The cpu&#39;s I am considering ( mind you these are expensive I know ) 

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116925&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=&amp;AID=10446076&amp;PID=3938566&amp;SID=

3. I am also worried about the heating majorly ( I think anybody would be with these prices lol... ) besides a good cpu system, and good cable management what else would be suggested? Are there special cases out there for computers such as this?

4. Talking about cases, I am going to need ONE HELL of a case to hold all of this. I want the case to also to be able to hold at least the larger OEM gpu&#39;s, and also of course the best cpu cooler. 

Thoughts/Suggestions? 

Yes I know I&#39;m crazy ;)</description>

Lol what the hell no, an AMD/Intel hybrid would be retarded, it would just give you a product in the middle of a little more shitty but a little more cheap.

What’s the debate? I agree with you that Intel is superior. I just said it was way more expensive. And if anyone claims AMD is better they’re just plain wrong, both have been tested numerous times and Intel’s processors overclocked perform better. AMD is just better bang for buck IMO.[/quote]</p>

<p>From what I can see benchmark wise the 8350 is like a low level 3rd grade i7?</p>
<p>I already know I can use an i5/i7 if I wanted to I was more or less curious what the performance of the server territory cpu’s (  aka xeon )  how they compare to a intel  i5/i7 considering the benchmarks I have seen show the xeons to be at the top ( due to their cache or whatever you call it I assume )</p>
<p>I mean in theory  nothing  says you can’t  game on an  xeon  cpu. (it’s still a 2011 socket)  I think if I end up getting an i7 it would probably be one of the  extreme editions but if I am going to spend that much, again, I would want to at least consider if Xeon  has any practical  use here performance  versus wise.</p>

<p>First off, appreciate all the comment/feedback thus far. I have been wanting to get an intel based system for a while now.</p>
<p>I figured that I suppose, and yeah I know it is at least partially  server territory cause I remember my dad used to have a $500,000 server rack with some  uber  memory and stuff in it where we worked but I wasn’t able to play with any of the fun stuff <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>In reality, would processing be slower in my situation as I will never use all 24 cores so most of them will never be dormant am I thinking about this correctly? Does the ghz really play any factor here versus let’s say an i5/i7? How does the Xeon series compare to the i5/i7’s?</p>
<p>From what I see on pcpartpicker the xeons are some of the top ranked cpu’s (would have to be with a 30mb cache o.0 ) but still 2.7 vs. 3.2 or whatever the i7’s are at now ( I have always been an AMD fanboy )</p>
<p>I’m thinking about selling my current build:</p>
<p>-amd 8350<br>
-r9 290x<br>
-16gb 1866</p>
<p>just selling the parts and making an intel base or having it to go towards one at least. I just don’t know if it would really be worth it. I can already pretty much do everything I need it to do.</p>

              <p>I am planning on saving up money to build “my gaming computer”</p>
<p>I have been going through various motherboards trying to figure out exactly what I wish to use and I think I am going to use this</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131817&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131817&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-</a><em>-na-</em>-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=&amp;AID=10446076&amp;PID=3938566&amp;SID=</p>
<p>However, my questions are these:</p>
<ol>
<li>what type of cpu cooler system would be suggested for best efficiency with something like this?</li>
<li>In theory, if I was to purchase 2 x 2011 12 core xeon cpu, I would literally have a 24 core system? 0_o… what concerns would i need to add into from this? The cpu’s I am considering ( mind you these are expensive I know )</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116925&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116925&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-</a><em>-na-</em>-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=&amp;AID=10446076&amp;PID=3938566&amp;SID=</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>I am also worried about the heating majorly ( I think anybody would be with these prices lol… ) besides a good cpu system, and good cable management what else would be suggested? Are there special cases out there for computers such as this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talking about cases, I am going to need ONE HELL of a case to hold all of this. I want the case to also to be able to hold at least the larger OEM gpu’s, and also of course the best cpu cooler.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoughts/Suggestions?</p>
<p>Yes I know I’m crazy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
