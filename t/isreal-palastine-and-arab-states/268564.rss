this whole situation is made much worse because of people&#39;s religious beliefs.


You actually have people who believe God gave them rights to this land, and anyone who disagrees must be killed and have their virgins captured.

Religion does not allow for compromise, and will stop at nothing to carry out God&#39;s wishes.

If Isrealis were not Jews and Arabs were not Muslims, this whole thing would have blown over decades ago, and exactly the same thing happened in Northern Ireland, and in Bosnia, and in Sri Lanka, and in Chechnya, etc etc etc...

If you&#39;re part of the Christian, Muslim or Jewish faith, you&#39;re part of a meme machine which does nothing but destroy and waste and cause massive suffering.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

I’ll also make you eat all the dirt you’ve got in your backyard until you die. This, my friend, is simply what happened in Ghaza, in a very small version.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">“The threat they pose to Israel”</span>.<br>
Have you ever thought that Israel might be the real threat? Owning a nuclear in the middle of countries that have nothing like that. Maybe you should think about that.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">“The wealth the leaders have -&gt; Nuclear arms + Crazy beliefs = WWIII”.</span><br>
Talking about the wealth the leaders have isn’t any of your business, it’s their country and they have the money(yes, that, in my point of view is very unjust, but it’s not us to decide, is it?). So simply don’t be like America, having their noses in everything that doesn’t have to do with them.  Crazy beliefs? Isn’t having that God promised one nation to own a land thousands of years ago, and now they want to do it is crazy? Isn’t planning to make all the Gentiles(non-Jews) their slaves one day, a crazy belief?(read The Protocols of the Elders of Zion). And on and on.<br>
“<span class="bbcode-b">WWIII?</span>” Read this book: Scenario for World War 3, Israel was nearly the reason behind it.</p>
<p>“And the leaders of Arab nations aren’t crazy. They do what any other leader would do in their situation: Look like a bad ass.”<br>
Aren’t they all? Just plain workers and agents for Israel and America(I love you Sheikh of Qatar! - I live in Qatar, btw).</p>
<p>And I would like to quote from myself:<br>
“Look look, Palestine is the land of my ancestors, my grandparents, and mine, and if it wasn’t to do with anything religious, then we can come to geographical evidences and prove to everyone it’s for Palestinians.  Very simply, this is my land, I should own it. The farms there belong to Palestinians, and the sand in there is my(Palestinian) peoples sand. Now, a simple question, am I doing ANYTHING wrong? I really don’t get where.<br>
I will share the land with you, I will share it with a Jewish, Christian, Arabic, Indian, Satanic, American, Hindi, Pakistani, Atheist man etc. You name it, and I swear I will open my arms to you and invite you to have breakfast, lunch and dinner. But if you are here to take my land, and to kick me out of it, and kill my sisters and brothers, and smash and burn my religious buildings and my precious Mosques and ruins, then no, you will only eat sand and get away to somewhere else. Am I doing anything wrong, I ask, again? I don’t believe I am.”</p>
<p>And I don’t think I’ll be able to reply, since Lothy will ban me again and again, like always, and ironically the reason for that is because I said what I wanted to. And thinking that, here, in Moparisthebest, someone would take his freedom of speech seems true in everything except talking bad about America and it’s people. Well, that’s how it was with me.<br>
So unless there’s a very important reply and questions that need answers, then it isn’t worth evading another ban for.<br>

<p>No, I am very well aware of how the US and European powers annexed the land that is now called Israel due to Zionists in the aftermath of WWII. But due to the fact my country is allied to Israel, I am bias. As I said, it is a very complex issue that is nearly impossible to deal with.</p>

<p>Reading your first two sentences, I think you blame Palestine. But when two fight, two are to blame. Especially in this case. And Palestine will never stop, because they fight for what is theirs. European Jews invaded their country, and claimed it to be theirs.</p>
<p>And the middle east is more then just oil. Iraq is going to be an important country soon. There already are a shitload of company’s interested in investing in Iraq. For instance: There is a huge concrete factory that had cost about $500 million, and it’s earning itself back in about 3 years.</p>

<p>this whole situation is made much worse because of people’s religious beliefs.</p>
<p>You actually have people who believe God gave them rights to this land, and anyone who disagrees must be killed and have their virgins captured.</p>
<p>Religion does not allow for compromise, and will stop at nothing to carry out God’s wishes.</p>
<p>If Isrealis were not Jews and Arabs were not Muslims, this whole thing would have blown over decades ago, and exactly the same thing happened in Northern Ireland, and in Bosnia, and in Sri Lanka, and in Chechnya, etc etc etc…</p>
<p>If you’re part of the Christian, Muslim or Jewish faith, you’re part of a meme machine which does nothing but destroy and waste and cause massive suffering.</p>
