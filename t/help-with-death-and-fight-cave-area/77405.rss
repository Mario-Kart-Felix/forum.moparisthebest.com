    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-death-and-fight-cave-area/77405</link>
    <description>Ok, my source is pimpscape, and whenever someone dies, the dont tele port on anybodies screen but theirs. So they end up somewhere else on my screen. EX. they die at 1990x 2000y, on their screen tele to 2000x 2000y, and run back to 1990x 2000y. On my screen, they die at 1990x 2000y, get back up, and run to 1980x 2000y. It created pking errors, so they can attack me but I cant attack them. About the fight cave area, the monsters there get to 0 hp then don&#39;t die. I have searched around and can&#39;t find anything, and this is my first server. Please help me.</description>

              <p>It’s just a matter of attacking them after they die, and they show up. If you just click the first blood spell on ancients and cast it, it works. the glitch only occurs right outside of the varrock bank, so its easy to attack them. Other than that, no glitch.[br][size=1]Posted on: April 09, 2007, 04:13:34 PM[/size][hr]Online… need players.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>The fight cave problem can be solved by going in npc.cfg and searching for the monster then change its HP. e.g <code>npc = 1		Man				2	7</code> The 7 is its hp. The monster your fighting might be at 0. Change it from 7 to whatever. Don’t know what the max is, but try to keep it under 200.</p>
