    <description>When i first started RS privates i had no idea about programming and now i have a good bit under my belt, mainly C++ but they are written almost the same from what i can see, just the syntax differences. My point to this post is to ask questions before i dive into a new project-

i may mention i used Deltascape source last time.

1) Best source to start with now-

2) 317, 508, or what now?

3) What modeling program would i use, ( i plan on re-doing the world map and items ) 
  * I am good with blender so if anyone knows if there is an exporter that would be lovely.

4) mySQL integration worth it at this point?

   * I would have online sign up with php

5) What is the current model for pvp?

6) Is it WORTH getting back into at this point in the game?</description>

              <p>[quote=“thrystascape, post:3, topic:440377”]Thanks, im glad to see that 317’s are still the prevalent sources, SQL wouldn’t be a problem for me because i have a good bit of experience working with it. I would build a simple Account creation for the sever with php. Do you know what model making programs are used and what object format?[/quote]I don’t deal with stuff like that, but when I do model (their shitty xD) I use Metaseq. I know there’s also ones like Blender (I think it’s called) and I think there’s also one called Cinema4D…</p>

              <p>The majority of the servers are 317 Project Insanity servers with 600+ data… The one thing that I just don’t get though is why not just use a 600+ client/server? And anywho, if your going 317 the best source would be Apallo but it’s hard to work with. And if I’m not mistaking, the world map is only tiles that are places around, I don’t thing any modeling is involved. Objects are models though, dunno if you mean that or not. I would personally like MySQL cause of easily being able to do Server to Site and Site to Server connections. That and for easy multiple worlds if need be. And what do you mean about the current model for pvp? And yes, it can be worth it if you bring something new to the table. As you can see, the majority of the servers are again Project Insanity with 600+ data in it. But in the end, if it’s worth getting back into or not will be 100% your decision. Hope I helped :S</p>
