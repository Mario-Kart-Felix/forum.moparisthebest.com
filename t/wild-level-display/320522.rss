    <title>Wild level display</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wild-level-display/320522</link>
    <description>Ok guys, I need a little help. Does anyone know how I can get the wild to display the levels (Corner of the screen).
As an addition if it isnt too much trouble I&#39;d like to know how I can edit the range of levels that can be attacked (I.E. &quot;The difference in your levels is too great! You must go deeper into the wild to the wild to attack this person&quot;) 
Any and all help is apreciated

-Thanks
