    <description>Before you answer...
My port 43594 is open I JUST checked canyouseeme.org
I do have my no-ip running and it is using my current IP
My server is set to where public can join. I know it works because 
My brother just got on from a different computer.
The IPs in his files ARE set to my no-ip and
Mine are set to 127.0.0.1 (LocalHost).
When we got on at the same time though, we could
not see each other in-game. I checked my Server Status on runelocus
and it says my server is offline.

PLEASE HELP.</description>

              <p>Well your brother can connect regardless because he is in your home i’m guessing, and that would be considered lan connection, are you sure you portforwarded the ip that your no-ip is using?</p>
<p>If you are 100% sure… You just need to add firewall acceptions or turn your firewall OFF.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
