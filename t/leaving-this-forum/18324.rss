    <title>Leaving this forum</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/leaving-this-forum/18324</link>
    <description>Hello mates,

I have been thinking of leaving this forum for quite some time now. I don&#39;t really have time, anymore, for the Internet or mainly this forum. A lot of people are leaving or were leaving so I decided that I should think about leaving for good. However, this forum is like my e-home, and I enjoy meeting new people and helping out whenever I can. I wanted to someday become a community member and then a moderator. 

Over the summer, I would have spent over 4 hours on this site, but now that school has started, I rarely log on.  I try to log on at least once a day but sometimes can’t. I have many reasons for leaving this site: I get too much homework everyday, and am working on it until 12 am. I have been getting moody because I only have 3-4 hours of sleep every night. :mad: I don&#39;t spend time with family anymore, and can&#39;t focus on my homework because I want to log on here. 

I can&#39;t think of anything else to say right now because I am really tired. Sorry if I don&#39;t have proper punctuation, I can&#39;t really be bothered right now. So I am considering leaving, but am not absolutely sure that I want to.

Have a good weekend.

Your friend,
Leader</description>

I spent three hours writing the entry essay, and then had to do an interview, but now I am in it. I thought I wasn’t going to be chosen. Now I have to wake up even earlier. So much to do, so little time.</p>

              <p>School is more important than the internet, even if it is like your e-home. This may sound harsh, but if this is getting in the way of your family and making it hard to concentrate, you need to take a break.</p>
<p>You can always come back and visit, besides, sometimes all you need is a break. Its not like you have to leave for good.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you do decide to leave, I’ll miss you. I always see you helping out around the forums, and its good to have somebody like that in a community, so I’m sure a lot of people will miss you.</p>
