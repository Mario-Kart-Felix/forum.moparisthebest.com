    <title>Exposing a limited API to a scripting engine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/exposing-a-limited-api-to-a-scripting-engine/545718</link>
    <description>I was just curious as to if anyone know how to expose a limited API to a scripting engine. I would like to expose some portions of my code to a scripting engine (Javascript, ruby, lua or something similar). The framework I&#39;m working on would allow users to upload their custom scripts for other users to download, but I don&#39;t want the average user to download a script, that ends up wiping their player database (or some similar effect). Is there a way I could do this? Would I have to use a SecurityManager or something similar? (The framework is written in Java).</description>

You all suck.</p>
<p>Use a separate database security context for running SQL from untrusted downloaded scripts. Do this by connecting to the database using a login which is limited in what it can do (for starters, it won’t be allowed to drop the database, change database structure, access the password field in a player table view, etc).<br>
If you load the downloaded scripts and execute them in such a way that they can’t bypass use of this security context then you’re all good. You just need to make sure your database login for this purpose is restricted in what it can do.<br>
