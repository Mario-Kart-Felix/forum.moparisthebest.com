    <title>Need a Client Background</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-client-background/181286</link>
    <description>I  need a background for my client, just want it to follow these requirements:

Image: my server is about pking, so try to get something along those lines
Text: Project PK (please make it look somewhat good at least...)
Colors: w/e looks good i guess, i wante there to be red and/or blue tho...
Theme: somethin that looks good again..


I kind of made the image and stuff easiest to make as possible.

If you make a picture, just post it here or pm me with it.

Thanks alot!</description>
