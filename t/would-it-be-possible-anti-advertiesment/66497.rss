    <description>To make it so that you can&#39;t have any links in the body of your post that doesn&#39;t sart with moparisthebest.com, and maybe someone could approve sites and then if you go to say moparisthebest.com/123(yoursite)efjndja then it will redirect. This is so poeple can&#39;t advertise there own sites without approval. in your sig, you oculd post any links though.</description>

I just mean that u pm a admin and the make it so that if you go <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/</a>(title of site/file/whatever) then it will redirect you, and you gfget isnta warned if the body of your post contains a link that doesn’t start with <a href="http://moparistehbest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparistehbest.com</a>[/quote]</p>
<p>Moparisthebest does not have enough time to do something like that. As Lothy said, it would not be worth the effort. And, as White Castle said, it is hard to manage a large list of downloads rather than approve a few in a message.</p>

<p>It’s not worth the effort. Most users are more then happy to comply with the rule - After all, it doesn’t take that long to message an admin. As for the occasions that people feel they’re above the rule, the topics are often quickly locked.</p>

<p>Mopar would need mods for that, and since he seldom can apply them (since he’d need to do it on both forums, moparisthebest and moparscape), this probably won’t happen. Nice idea though.</p>
