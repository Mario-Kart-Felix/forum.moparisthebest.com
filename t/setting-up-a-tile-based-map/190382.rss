    <title>Setting up a tile-based map?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-up-a-tile-based-map/190382</link>
    <description>Using Java 2D Graphics, how would I setup a &#39;map&#39; or &#39;level&#39; which contains lets say 12x12 tiles?
So if I had a 2x2 map, it would look like:
[img]http://i25.tinypic.com/213pvzs.png[/img]

Now, having that, how would I setup a system so that each individual tile could be easily modified?
That would make it so Tile C would be at coordinates (1, 2). Keep in mind, this wouldnt be your normal coordinate graph from math class. Each tile down would go plus one for the y value, and each tile to the right would go plus one for the x value. 

Following that last paragraph, I&#39;ll give an example. If I wanted to place a 12x12 image on the tile at (1, 2), I would do something like [i]graphics.drawImage(&quot;./image.jpg&quot;, x, y, null).[/i] The x and y spots is where I get mixed up. Its not that I dont know what that is or how it works, I do. But I dont want to keep specifying those two values by hand. Instead, somewhat of an array[], or multi-array[][] (?), is what I was looking at. But I cant quite think of anything right now. 

Thanks in advance.
[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 17, 2008, 06:36:17 PM[/size][hr]Well, according to Cheese_Police and lawl on IRC:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[18:26] c|p: Tile[][] map = new Tile[width][height];
[18:26] c|p: ma[i][/i]p[x[i][/i]][y] = new Tile(dicks);
[18:27] c|p: or
[18:27] c|p: do it da other way
[18:27] lawl: ye lul wut i did
[18:27] lawl: new tile[w * h]
[18:27] c|p: ye
[18:27] TeleNubby: ffs
[18:27] lawl: w = off / h
[18:27] lawl: or some gay shit
[18:27] TeleNubby: wtf didnt i think o fthat
[18:27] c|p: dats a much better way tbh
[18:27] c|p: do it the way lawl is suggesting&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I half-get it, half-dont. Can somebody explain a bit more? Also, what are the [][] arrays called exactly?</description>

<p>I will accept the king moron title. That post was a very dum rant of mine, but it had its use. I was trying to stress the point that Ollie is being a little arrogant asshole right now and should gtfo tbh.</p>

Moparscapers do have friends. In fact, they have lots of them.

You could check a random between 4 numbers specifying whether or not the npc should go a tile north, south, east, or west. And, before it moves the npc to that tile, it checks to see whether or not it is moving outside its walking boundaries, in which case it would re-randomize the numbers again.</p>
<p>As for dialog, all you would do is paint it and draw the string (obviously). I don’t see how that would be very difficult.</p>
<p>The attacking system would just require a properly timed sequence of animations and a randomization of ‘damage’ dealt (again, between a range of numbers).<br>
