    <title>Server wont run, changed spawn.cfg</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-wont-run-changed-spawn-cfg/551521</link>
    <description>First this is the error code popping up when i run my server:
[code]Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
Caused by: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 7
        at server.model.npcs.NPCHandler.loadAutoSpawn(NPCHandler.java:4121)
        at server.model.npcs.NPCHandler.&lt;init&gt;(NPCHandler.java:37)
        at server.Server.&lt;clinit&gt;(Server.java:70)
[/code]

After looking into it i found lots of people have posted this same problem (mostly after changing item.cfg) but have been unsolved.
The people giving advice on it have said two main solutions 
-there is a space some where that should have a tab (i looked through my spawn.cfg pretty well and didnt see any)
or
-the values are filled in incorrectly (i think this maybe my problem)

ex:
the top of my spawn.cfg says:
[code]//      spawnX    spawnY   height      walk      maxhit      attack     defence      description[/code]

so it should be 
[code]//      spawnX    spawnY   height      walk      maxhit      attack     defence      description
spawn = 914	3098	3926	0	1	30	90	90	BattleMage3 Wildly[/code]
(five numbers between the coords and the description)

but i have some codes like this but is it something that was already in the coding, not something i added
[code]//      spawnX    spawnY   height      walk      maxhit      attack     defence      description
//Home
spawn = 555	3084	3500	0	0	0	0	0	0 	skill cape shop
spawn = 2566	3086	3500	0	0	0	0	0	1	wise old man
spawn = 522	3077	3511	0	0	0	0	0	0	IBUYANYTHING
spawn = 520	3080	3512	0	0	0	0	0	1	GenStore
spawn = 290	3084	3511	0	0	0	0	0	0	2b tickets
spawn = 599	3081	3486	0	0	0	0	0	0	Makeover mage
spawn = 2258	3106	3560	0	0	0	0	0	2	Mage of zammy[/code]
(six numbers between the coords and description on these)

because it is not following the pattern that is on top i feel like the codes with the extra number are the wrong codes that are messing this up but i dont want to go deleting stuff without knowing what they are there for.
-what is the extra number representing on these codes?
-should i be adding a number to all the codes with 5 there or should i be deleting one on all the codes with 6?


If anyone knows how to fix this problem please help out as soon as possible so that i can figure this out and finish the spawns.</description>

<p>Interesting. Just throwing this out there though never pay someone to code your source. Keep your source to yourself, keep it secure,  keep working on it and it’ll be valueble.

<p>[quote=“trilogy-reborn, post:9, topic:551521”]yeah ofc playing rsps’s with boring quest where you go kill a boss and your done is the reason i want to make a few small story lines and maybe a big storyline involving pvp gear, the gods, or something. im trying to make mine very unique and interesting to play. no clue if ill ever host it or not since i was told vs hosting, and advertising can be very expensive. also i can easy do the free forums websites myself but i would also have to learn html forums coding or pay someone to do it cause i think the free forums seem to suck and the add banners they put everywhere are annoying</p>
<p>but hosting one day or not… learning &amp; coding these rsps’s is a very fun side hobby for me to do when im not at work. my progress is a little slow because i’ve learned a ton lately but im still pretty new but im getting lots of progress and having fun doing it.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Also if i do host it one day dont i have to get permission from xenon since that is my starting source?<br>
ive changed a lot and plan to do tons more before that point so it wont really be a leach but i think i still need permission</p>
<p>Edit <span class="hashtag">#2:</span> also with the i have a rs2011 remake source with that interface and it works but the code for that source is so different from the pi source i been learning everything on it is very confusing. i could probably rip the files no problem but i think it would take a bit of reprogramming to make all the buttons work on the pi source but that will be something i research a bit and try to figure out myself. someone offered to do it for me for 50$ but this being a hobby to me; him doing it would not be helpful to me lol i want to learn and do it myself so that i accomplish something nice lol[/quote]<br>
Hosting can be costly and it can be cheap. it depends where you buy, and when. I buy domains for 50 cents. Yes, 50 cents. And others buy them for $1-$20. It all depends on where you shop. I also have a VPS that I’m only playing $10 a month on, add on webhosting and I’m only paying $17 a month to host my rsps.<br>
But if it was publicly hosted and I had forum adverts and etc, I’d probably want a better vps than the $10 one, so that’d be upgraded to one of twice it’s value or more. Just to ensure my players get no lag (As I haven’t had lag on my current one).</p>
<p>Since the server was released, you don’t actually <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> to give credits, unless you release the server for download as well. You can give credits if you’d like, but be weary, as if you tell people which client you used, they <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> be able to find a copy of it and then connect to your server using their client… Which can lead to lots of exploits if you don’t have server sided checks in place (And some even if you do have those checks).</p>

              <p>Adding that character design interface would be rather difficult, as you’d probably have to modify lots of the client. I’d rather just use a client that already has it… Or at the least try to rip it from one of the newer clients that does have it.</p>
<p>As for the rest, you should go ahead and work on it… Custom quests are always good, just try to add a story line to it and not just a quest for the player to find random crap and give it to a guy, then maybe kill a boss. At least put work into it.</p>

oh well i know how to figure it out now. and btw i think it was on a different help thread i posted but you posted a link for me to learn how to understand some java. i didnt look at it right away but i checked it out a couple weeks ago and it was a bit confusing at first but pretty helpful in the end. Thank you for that and also thanks for nearly always being the first person to help me on my problems.</p>
<p>I really want to get good at coding rsps so i can make a very good and unique pi rsps (using a xenon source atm) and maybe move up to the harder rsps’s to code one day like rs2011 remake- i have the rs2011 remake source but it is way different from pi and pretty confusing so i want to master pi and delta before moving up to working on that source.</p>
<p>I am about to go take a look in the developement section to see if posting my progress there is something id like to do or not.<br>
i want to show my progress but also i have some origanal ideas im working on that i dont want someone else to put into their server. so idk</p>
<p>If there is more things your can teach me and wouldnt mind with maybe we can add each others emails or get on skype or team speak someday.</p>
<p>here are some plans i want to work on that i will spending a lot of time coming up trying to learn/ figure out:<br>
-i have xenon pi base but i want the high detail awesome character creation/ customization like eoc/ rs3 had.<br>
<img src="http://i593.photobucket.com/albums/tt19/michaelrobson02/charactercreation.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
-i want to make lots of custom quests with good stories/ diologue.<br>
-skilling randoms like gems from mining, guards when theiving.<br>
-got couple custom minigame ideas (rather not say here for others to read)<br>
-there is a lot more id like to do but i think this message is long enough lol i can always tell you more later if you get intrested what i am working on.</p>
<p>sorry this is so long, thanks for reading it, and let me know what you think please.<br>

there was a space somewhere when there should have been a space and i found a good way to fix it myself.</p>
<p>Tip for the next person that ends up on this page because  they are having the same problem:<br>
I figured out a simple/ obvious way to find and fix the problem.</p>
<p>1.) ctrl+ f to bring up the find tool.<br>
2.) search for space - " "<br>
3.) if you find any in the middle of your code just replace it with a tab</p>
<p>lol with so much codes looking for a space rather than a tab just seems overwhelming but i didnt realize how easy of a problem it was to fix.</p>

Either the NPC’s you added have 1 value fewer than what the server tries to parse or the NPC’s already in the spawn file have 1 value too much. Post your NPCHandler.loadAutoSpawn() method so I can have a better look.</p>

Here’s an example on a similar error you can use to debug where your error is.<br>

              <p>First this is the error code popping up when i run my server:</p>
<p><code>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
Caused by: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 7
        at server.model.npcs.NPCHandler.loadAutoSpawn(NPCHandler.java:4121)
        at server.model.npcs.NPCHandler.&lt;init&gt;(NPCHandler.java:37)
        at server.Server.&lt;clinit&gt;(Server.java:70)
</code></p>
<p>After looking into it i found lots of people have posted this same problem (mostly after changing item.cfg) but have been unsolved.<br>
The people giving advice on it have said two main solutions<br>
-there is a space some where that should have a tab (i looked through my spawn.cfg pretty well and didnt see any)<br>
or<br>
-the values are filled in incorrectly (i think this maybe my problem)</p>
<p>ex:<br>
the top of my spawn.cfg says:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>so it should be</p>
<p><code>//      spawnX    spawnY   height      walk      maxhit      attack     defence      description
spawn = 914	3098	3926	0	1	30	90	90	BattleMage3 Wildly</code><br>
(five numbers between the coords and the description)</p>
<p>but i have some codes like this but is it something that was already in the coding, not something i added</p>
<p><code>//      spawnX    spawnY   height      walk      maxhit      attack     defence      description
//Home
spawn = 555	3084	3500	0	0	0	0	0	0 	skill cape shop
spawn = 2566	3086	3500	0	0	0	0	0	1	wise old man
spawn = 522	3077	3511	0	0	0	0	0	0	IBUYANYTHING
spawn = 520	3080	3512	0	0	0	0	0	1	GenStore
spawn = 290	3084	3511	0	0	0	0	0	0	2b tickets
spawn = 599	3081	3486	0	0	0	0	0	0	Makeover mage
spawn = 2258	3106	3560	0	0	0	0	0	2	Mage of zammy</code><br>
(six numbers between the coords and description on these)</p>
<p>because it is not following the pattern that is on top i feel like the codes with the extra number are the wrong codes that are messing this up but i dont want to go deleting stuff without knowing what they are there for.<br>
-what is the extra number representing on these codes?<br>
-should i be adding a number to all the codes with 5 there or should i be deleting one on all the codes with 6?</p>
<p>If anyone knows how to fix this problem please help out as soon as possible so that i can figure this out and finish the spawns.</p>
