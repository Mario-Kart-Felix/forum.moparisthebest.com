    <title>Java NIO SelectionKey attachment</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-nio-selectionkey-attachment/462123</link>
    <description>I was told that when writing a socket server using NIO, to map client objects to their SocketChannel or SelectionKey instead of using the SelectionKey.attach() method. This was because once the client disconnects, the key remains in the selector&#39;s keys list. But after logging in 30 or so clients (bots), I found that after they all disconnected, only one key was left in the selector, the ServerSocketChannel&#39;s key. Am I okay to assume that Oracle has since fixed the issue I was advised about?</description>

              <p>I don’t think it was ever an issue. See the documentation for SelectionKey and Selector.</p>
<blockquote>A key is added to its selector's cancelled-key set when it is cancelled, whether by closing its channel or by invoking its cancel method. Cancelling a key will cause its channel to be deregistered during the next selection operation, at which time the key will removed from all of the selector's key sets.</blockquote>
You don't have to worry about cancelled keys if you use selectedKeys(). I'm not too sure about synchronisation, though.
