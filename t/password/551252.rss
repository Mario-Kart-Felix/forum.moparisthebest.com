    <description>How to add like when a player logout the password will be &quot;reseted&quot; and it won&#39;t be saved.

This thing will prevent scamming/hacking when he logins in other computers. 
The meaning is when you logout it&#39;ll only appear the Username you have entered but in the password text there&#39;s nothing and he has to enter it again if he wants to log-in again.

Would anyone help?</description>

              <p>In a 317 revision look under packet 109 (S -&gt; C). It is the logout packet, so you should find the method you need somewhere nested in it. Assuming you have a 317… In other revisions it be different.</p>

              <p>FYI: There should be a “resetLogout” method. That method cleans up the client data and resets it to the login screen. If you want to clear any information on logout, that would be the place to do it.</p>

              <p>Oh yeah it worked. I was searching in the server files.<br>
I found it in the client folder in client.java in the “resetPassword” method.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

              <p>The odds of this happening are minimal, but whatever. What revision are you running?<br>
It’s definitely client sided, so don’t look in the server files.<br>
I’m not entirely sure where it’s located, but probably somewhere within a login/logout packet.</p>

              <p>You open your client, you enter your username and password normally, you play in-game and after that you logout or exit the client and everything is okay.<br>
Sometimes people are required to re-log (let’s say: they want to be skulled) so when they logout they’ll see their username and password are in place and to ease it for them they just click ‘login’ again and play again…<br>
But… what if they want to log-in to other account? Or he’s at his friend PC and his friend wants login? Let’s say that first one got out of home and then his friend wants to login, when the first logs out and goes the second comes and wants to enter his password and username to play too but he sees that his friend forgot to ‘remove’ his password so the second one can log-in with his not own account and can scam him.</p>
<p>I’m asking for something that would remove the password when you logout and you have to re-type it to prevent scams/hacks.</p>
