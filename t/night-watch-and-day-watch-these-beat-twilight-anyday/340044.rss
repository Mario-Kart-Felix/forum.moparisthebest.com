    <description>I&#39;ve only seen Night Watch but Day Watch looks fucking awesome!

I&#39;m not sure about Day Watch but Night Watch is in Russian but has English subtitles.

Both movies are epic.

Well what I&#39;ve seen from Night Watch, is that there are two sides, Light and Dark. On number one I forgot his name but the main character finds out that his son is a other, the son he never knew. He was to tell his son to choose between the light or dark, in the end the main character wasn&#39;t there for his son (he lies) and Yugo goes to the dark side. But then I think on Day Watch Yugo goes rogue. Oh yeah the dark side are vampires and both sides can go invisible, well into a different dimension but still in the same world, that is called The Gloom.</description>
