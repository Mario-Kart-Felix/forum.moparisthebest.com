Idk about him, but I don’t… Is there such thing as “entry level” programming jobs? I mean I do know shit about programming, but it’s nothing that has a degree or etc behind it.[/quote]<br>
There is. I was a Jr Software Developer with no previous experience, I most likely know less about programming than you &amp; I had not so good grades. That being said my CV &amp; interview skills are good, I have a portfolio and I of course have a decent value of desirable traits.<br>
It wasn’t easy though, often I got told to do things with no support (because they didn’t have time to help) that having a good education would have helped with for sure. At other times it sucked too, doing the same testing over and over again for literally 3+ days, writing interfaces/re-factoring code (inc thinking you made a mistake then going through it but finding out it was someone else updated code and that part of the program/site no longer functioned = days wasted) and so on.</p>
<p>But being pushed is good of course; I learned a hell of a lot, earned money, gained a good reference (I’m back in education now) &amp; have the option to go back their in the future.</p>

Know your basics like data structures and algorithms. OO and language concepts come too (ex: what is a virtual destructor). Try looking for the Cracking the Code book, it’s a good way to prep for interviews. All the places I’ve worked at will laugh at you if you don’t have a degree or at least significant experience.

              <p>The need for programmers is in rather high demand right now since many companies are currently looking for websites and applications. I’ve done internships with a few local software development companies who really stressed that a large part of obtaining the job is how well you work and interact with others since almost all projects are done in small groups and managed by a single individual. The general stereotype of a programmer is a socially awkward person who doesn’t interact well with others, most companies won’t hire someone like this because they worry that person could slow down development because of an inability to communicate. Education is very important too don’t think i’m hinting that it isn’t, but ten degrees still wont seal the deal if you cant make eye contact with your interviewer.</p>
<p>If your sporting a 2+ year degree from either a college or trade school, work well in groups, and are enthusiastic (or at-least pretend to be) about the job your applying for you should be alright.</p>

              <p>I’ve worked got Xerox, Amazon, Microsoft, and Nordstrom. All you really have to do is know your stuff for the job you’re applying for. Generally, phone screens ask you the basic questions. If it’s an SDE role, it’s mostly C#/Java questions, if it’s an SDET role, there will be testing questions as well (what unit testing is, test driven development, what to test given a certain situation, etc). How to implement certain algorithms, like Stack, Linked List, cyclical linked lists, how to implement a certain function iteratively or recursively (ie. calculating a specific fibonacci number), what the difference is, why you would choose one over the other. If you don’t know something, be honest. “How would you implement an ecommerce website with Angular?”, if you don’t know the technology, state it. Employers hate nothing more than believing you know a technology, and then finding out you’re incompetent when they ask you to do something.</p>
<p>Once you get in, you’ll likely be working in an Agile/Scrum lifecycle, so knowing what the basic process is would help. But most of my experience is in enterprise systems. I haven’t had a lot of experience in little 1-2 person dev shops.</p>

The only way it came about is when I give my email to people they see its at a top level domain.  There is a surprisingly number of businesses out there that want to be online but can’t afford top dollar web development firms.

<p>Sure there are. I am in co-op at my university and even many first years got jobs and internships. Realistically it may not be as much programming as you would like (such as testing and QA jobs) but typically this is what you start doing if you don’t have a solid portfolio or are just starting school for your major. However, I knew lots of people who had actual programming positions and even some who had pretty important tasks assigned to them. It’s definitely possible, you just need to network effectively. The great thing about doing a co-op at your school is that the network is already setup for you and applying to jobs are easy.</p>
