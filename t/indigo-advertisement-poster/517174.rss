              <p>Thanks for that Kidpaparoach I never even noticed it was there (mainly because i’m a keyboard noob) I usually edit the text and rasterize them as I go along (not like in the poster) but this is really help full <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I see, well if your intending to post it on forums then the size is fine. You should post in the dev section here and on r-s I’m sure you can find someone who is willing to do those jobs for you, it wouldn’t even be too hard either I doubt if you showed some of your work.</p>
<p>I see, well the style hasn’t failed but I personally don’t think it’s suitable for RSPS; the background is a bit random but it still looks aesthetically pleasing which means it works perfectly fine. I see, I’ve gotten pretty used to spell-check too.<br>
Here you go, this is for cs5 (I’m not sure which version you have) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6C4AMUrgQ0" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6C4AMUrgQ0</a> .</p>

              <p>[quote=“Kidpaparoach, post:4, topic:517174”]I know your not asking for comments on the server itself but the server itself looks nice :P.</p>
<p>Ontopic: I don’t like the font you’ve used which says Indigo and the lighting, well I like it but I simply don’t think it looks nice on your poster. The info at the bottom &amp; pictures could be moved a little to the right as the images don’t look perfectly uniform; not a big deal I’m just trying to find things to criticize. Theirs a typo which says something like ‘kill your skill icon’ which you should probably change :P.</p>
<p>I really like it as a whole though, good job.</p>
<p>Edit: After reading Soulcists post I would like to add in I think it’d look better if it was scaled larger and if possible slightly wider.[/quote]</p>
<p>The image was originally meant to fit the whole page (100% width) which I don’t know why it’s not. (But I would fix it if I was serious about server).<br>
Thanks for the comment on the server although it’s not something i’ll be hosting because I hate being alone with a project having somebody manage server etc would be cool (including that if server was released it would not bother me lmao).</p>
<p>OT: The actual theme of the poster was meant to a street/graffiti style (where I clearly failed), my excuse for all the typo’s are that i’m so used to having a spell checker (automatically working) that I don’t take notice (photoshop may having something like this if somebody can show me how to set it up lol). There’s a gap from the footer in case I wanted to add more stuff in!</p>
