    <title>Who is Raw, really?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-is-raw-really/19362</link>
    <description>Ok, you guys ready for this?

It&#39;s a chain linking the Josh we all know and love to someone else entirely :D
I&#39;m going to be short on logic-description because it&#39;s 1 AM and I want to sleep before I have to wake up in five hours.

Be aware of various aliases: Josh, Hitman, raw, and apparently Michael.

In some of ruler&#39;s logs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sep 28 21:53:34 &lt;RaW&gt;	you still use MSN?
Sep 28 21:53:38 &lt;RaW&gt;	you must add me
Sep 28 21:53:41 &lt;RaW&gt;	and not be hostile with me
...
Sep 28 21:54:05 &lt;RaW&gt;	guvnor@rex.co.il&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(note the .il address, from Israel-loving 00josh)

On rootkit.com:

&lt;blockquote&gt;hittman

e-mail: pleasemetouchgmailcom

MSN: guvnor@rex.co.il

real life name: raw

Country: United Kingdom&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We find something important here: pleasemetouch@gmail.com is linked to raw and guvnor@rex.co.il.
Also, hittman&#39;s only post on rootkit is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Making money in an anonymous manner using TOR and E-Gold : message board

Posted by hittman (Untrusted stranger) [ip info hidden] - May 26 2006, 23:54 (UTC+0)
erm
hi

contact me to make money some deals

guvnor@rex.co.il - MSN
pleasemetouch@gmail.com - email&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you remember ruler&#39;s earlier postings about raw&#39;s egold scams, that title is telling.

Now let&#39;s move on: what can we find about pleasemetouch@gmail?

First, a voip board posting looking for business partners:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...blah...
INTERESTED? EMAIL ME AT: pleasemetouch@gmail.com

Mick.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A reverse email search on MySpace gets us this guy: Micky.

http://www.myspace.com/kurbsideprophets
(The Kurbside Prophets are a Plymouth local band? Only reference I can find is an old bar site&#39;s open mic night.)

Apparently he attempted to use Josh as a RuneScape-only identity to avoid connecting his scams to real life (that&#39;s shaky though).</description>

<p>There <em>is</em> an AutoRune Ltd registered in the UK. I have no non-circumstantial evidence that it actually belongs to RaW, but he’s used it in the past to threaten people making “AutoRune Reborn/2/cracked” bots, saying that the name AutoRune is a trademark as the name of his company (which does not appear to be true). I’ve been trying to get more info on it for several days (among other things to verify the 2002 founding date), but the time offset is really limiting my access to the Companies House service. Anyone who’s awake and at a computer from 07:00 - 12 Midnight UK Time want to check it out for us?</p>

<p>Anyway: the point of this thread was to link two of RaW’s aliases, and to advise anyone (like ruler maybe) who is still looking for info on him that you might find him as “Michael Watkins” in more legitimate capacities and that he might be older than you think (if AutoRune Ltd. were really founded in 2002, he would have been 13 according to that MySpace page - who registers a company to or for a 13-year-old kid?).</p>

[/quote]<br>
If you deal with scammers you are a enemy that is how i see it.  That is why you were hit get use to it.  Your affliations with lgz have hurt so many including me.  I have lost about 2 days and 14days of uptime due to lgz and what you told them.  They costed pplsqlballz even more money wise but that wasn’t related to you.  They wasted hours of nerices time.  Countless hours battling attacks also.</p>
<p>You don’t take a stand against it you would rather go with the flow and make sure they are happy and make sure they ahve no reason to be against you.</p>
<p>Their is no middle ground with me.  However you were not on the middle ground since you were talking with them and let them be admins/mods on your site after they attacked you.  Not to mention lieing to both me and them.</p>
<p>I dont let the past die, past history is good indicator of future behavior.</p>
<p>I don’t care if your “innocent”, if you help scammers in any way then i am against and will be against till you change your ways.</p>
<p>You have changed since then, you no longer talk to them but then again they havn’t been around since pplsqlballz got scammed.  I also think the last admins from their camp has been removed from your site  (i think).</p>
<p>I do like nukewire’s position against them.  He is my only ally in your camp on this issue and has picked up a sword in the past.</p>
<p>Here is what they forced me to say after 2 weeks of downtime:<br>

What in the hell?</p>
<p>It’s not like I told everyone to go so I can laugh at them.  He’s not even a threat, that’s what I said “gtfo and now one cares.”<br>
I don’t baby people, ruler.  And, they’ll hear a million times that RaW scams, but they won’t listen.<br>
[/quote]<br>
not a threat?  i guess i overestimated your intelligence.  You should reads the history of this kid in the cheating community and out side of it, he always has a scam going where it be in rs cheating, e-gold, or other places.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ruler. I. Do. Not. Like. Scammers.</p>
<p>Neox is admin on my site. He was admin i think on my site before legion. I like Neox thus he is admin. Neox is cool that is why he is admin. Neox is a good admin. Before you brought it up in some conversation i didnt know Neox was admin at legion, but i found out because Neox said they would resign as admin their because you were threating to Ddos Rs-resources.</p>
<p>Yes i regret “alling with them”, for ripping and watever. They were right though, why should i have given into your demands? If neox wanted to be admin there that is HIS choice. I dont have the right to say to Neox, ‘hey because your admin here, your not allowed to be admin anywhere else’…How childish.</p>
<p>Neox is still admin on my site, why should i remove him? He is a good friend of mine and an excellent admin.</p>
<p>What has pplz being scammed got to do with anything?</p>
<p>He needed 10 mill because of a reason and asked me to find it, i asked Neox, and as a thankyou me an Neox both recieved 20Mill each. That is how he met Neox. Neox then found him many customers. After a while, pplz stopped selling because he was angry at getting scammed so much.</p>
<p>What Pplz that got to do with anything? You have dragged yet someone else into this, whom has nothing to do with it, and whom neither cares.</p>
<p>To pwnd: Im pretty much done, its just about writing about how to implement it now, ive written all the sections on gathering the stuff you need. I should be done by the end of this week since im off all week :D. Cant wait to finish it lol :p. After im done, i’ll probaly write some new tuts, maybe on getting Hooks. Idk, depends what i feel like =p</p>

And i noticed<br>
“(1:15:22 AM) <a href="mailto:w12ath@jaghax.com">w12ath@jaghax.com</a>: I remember him talking to me about the hitman”</p>
<p>Could be raw that attacked all 3 months ago.  Would be scary if raw and fagex have some sorta relationship.  Also odd every time i post at fagex my acct get disabled and posts deleted.</p>

              <p>[quote=“jme_009, post:25, topic:19362”]Ruler’s way too paranoid, he thought I was thesmacker11’s alias, just the other day. Although, it would seem that smacker wishe’s he were me, after reading this on his stupid site: "Azn-Hosting is now under new management. “Smacker” is not longer part of this network. All you current hostee’s will be fine. Sincerely Jamie Johnston "<br>
-.- Everyone hates him, so he put my name so that people would actually trust his stupid hosting. Can’t believe I stuck up for that jerk.<br>
[/offtopic]<br>
If you ask me raw probably just asked kaitnieks to link to his site, so kaitnieks did without caring so much. Notice that he did remove it fairly quickly, if you don’t remember. When I told kaitnieks about how horrible it was at autorune(If you don’t remember, flaming and spamming was the cool thing to do there, as long as you said fuck every second word then you would become a mod and be considered cool.) I told kait to link to <a href="http://saradomin.net" rel="nofollow noopener">saradomin.net</a>(everyone seemed to switch over there instead), he said he wasnt going to link there. But shortly after he did remove the link to raws forums, probably had nothing to do with what I told him though.[/quote]<br>
i didn’t post that anywhre i just quesiton you in irc, see you used the same paypal as smacker.  That is all.  you are not smacker.  I remember many things hehe.</p>
