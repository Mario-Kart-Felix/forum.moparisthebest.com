    <description>So this idea came to me today, while I was sitting in school and thinking about not-school. Was still sobering up from smoking before hand too. Also, this is sort-of based off Kaysie&#39;s baby making (in the idea) but that&#39;s about all.

This could be a skill, quest (series), activity, minigame, or just an option. It all depends on how you implement it.

So basically, the name is everything. You can unlock the option (or ability) to have a family on your server. Though, my idea is you don&#39;t just click &#39;start family&#39; and boom you have a family. It needs to be somewhat realistic.

[b]Dating[/b] - As most would know (or i assume nowadays) to get a girl/boyfriend, you go on at least one date. In your server, you&#39;d have many various men and women around cities in Gielinor. (If you want, you can make some gay, that&#39;s up to you to implement) Now, the player (you) must do the most nerve racking thing ever, which would be asking them out, or getting to know them. When the player clicks on the person of their choice, you start with a friendly dialogue, and the npc would respond back saying key words about themselves. Eventually throughout the dialogue, you get the option to *flirt* with the npc to try and *woo* them. After you do, you can ask them out for a date. Make sure you ask them to the right location or you&#39;ll be turned down.

[b]On the date[/b] Great, now the player is out with a person. The ideal setup for this would be to make it kind of like a cutscene, where the minimap blacks out and the inventory isn&#39;t accessible. How detailed this is would be up to the programmer. Lets say for instance player [u]tehNumbahOne[/u] went out on a date with npc [u]Jillian[/u]. She&#39;s a &#39;loose&#39; girl and loves to drink, so tehNumbahOne took her to the Jolly Boar Inn in Varrock. A bartender (the waiter) comes over ever so often, asking if you want new drinks, refills, etc. As the date progresses you are supposed to learn what you can about Jillian and impress her, depending on how in depth these characters go, you can actually make them show signs of disgust (among other feelings) and have them (or yourself) ramble on about things, which can turn you (if you pick to) off or the date. After the date, (s)he may lead you on to continue the date *cough winky winky cough* somewhere else, or offer to go on another. Alternatively, you can ask for a second date, end it there, or attempt to do the dirty deed.

You can go on multiple dates, as many as you want, or until the npc looses interest in you.

[b]Marriage[/b] All good relationships eventually take it to the next level, marriage. Again, depending on the situation, the npc may even ask you to marry them! In order for you to propose to them, you need a ring. How valuable it is would be up to you, but remember, the bigger the better ;). when you propose, you have 3 possible outcomes:
1) The npc rejects you (nicely) and says you should say friends (the friendzone haha).
2) They say yes. Time to plan the wedding.
3) The npc rejects you (harshly) and throws things at you, so on so forth.

[b]Wedding[/b] Now you&#39;ve got a significant other willing to marry you, and a ring. All that&#39;s left, besides the rest of your life, is the wedding. Here&#39;s a few ways this can be set up:

A] There&#39;s npcs around the world that are wedding planners. You talk to them about setting up the wedding. This includes fees, venue (where it&#39;ll be), guests (Hey, maybe you can make it possible to invite REAL players? hah), and the whole 10 yards.
B] Skip the wedding planners, and you handle it all. You find a priest (from a local church) to handle the actual ceremony, and you deal with everything else.
C] The npc (your significant other) sets up everything, you get to pay for it all though, so be prepared.

Regardless of what you pick above. The following needs to happen: A priest must attend, to validate the wedding rituals. The rings must be placed on your hands (Just use an anim of some sort). And of course, the big kiss.

-If you can&#39;t tell, I&#39;m running out of fuel for this idea. I may (more than likely) will edit this more later.

[b]Honeymoon[/b] Every good marriage starts with some form of honeymoon (don&#39;t quote me on this, as I know it&#39;s not always true). Use various houses/inns for this as I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be right for a person to hold a honeymoon fighting the kbd (though you could implement a feature to have your wife/husband go with you on adventures and fight other npcs). Now, to be cheesy and make life easier, you should check into the house/motel, and have a quick cutscene showing you and your npc go to their room, have it cut to black, and them walk out a few seconds later.

[b]Living arrangements[/b] this is were it gets really creative. You know all those houses either not used or used by an npc you don&#39;t care to actually do something with? Well now you have a use for those houses. You and your SO (significant other, tired of typing it) need a place to live in. So now it&#39;s time to shop for a house. How I think it &#39;could&#39; be implemented, is a house that is taken by another player would (obviously have someone in it, and) have a signpost outside of it that would read upon examining: &quot;This house belongs to &lt;HouseOwnerName&gt; and &lt;TheirSO&gt;&quot; After you pick a house, you talk to a real estate agent (have fun figuring out a way to implement this), you pay for the house, and then move in.

-SideIdea- You can remove all objects from the house and have the player shop for new items.

[b]Children, and lovemaking[/b] Yes, in [i]some[/i] marriages sex happens. Bad jokes aside, you and your loved one can have occasional sex, depending on their mood. Remember, these are time before there were such things like condoms, or stds (haha again, jokes. We&#39;re just pretending that stds don&#39;t exist here). So randomly one time after sex your SO (or if you&#39;re a girl in the game, you. Or if it&#39;s gay marriage, neither) can get pregnant. Unless you want to work out how to make them look pregnant, ignore that and have a set amount of time (1 week?) happen before she bursts. If you&#39;re offline the time she is supposed to give birth, (or if you&#39;re offline when you&#39;re supposed to give birth), you just suddenly have a kid at your house now (again, lazy on the details).



Anywhore, this idea isn&#39;t final, and again it&#39;s just an idea. Have fun.</description>

Very true, but there’d have to be a way for them to reproduce without the player killing off all spawns.[/quote]<br>
