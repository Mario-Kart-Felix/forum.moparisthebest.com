    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-is-a-real-development-project/519206</link>
    <description>I&#39;m gathering some developers for a project which will soon be started on. I&#39;m hoping to writing all the content from scratch and with the right developers I&#39;m sure we could scramble something sexy! 

All project details are currently unknown due to the fact nothing has been started and having a team to discuss the upcoming of the server I&#39;m certain that we&#39;ll produce something worth getting acknowledged. Enough said I&#39;m considering a 503+ server (favorites) with a couple of 600/700+ features (not using any crappy 317 stuff) to create that uniqueness because we&#39;re not Jagex, and no way going to create a remake. 

Enough said here&#39;s my sexy development/advertisement poster! (which is uncompleted and has like 1% with this topic, but it looked good?)

<p>It really does not matter too me who I have because I know really skilled people in everything there is too it who would gladly contribute and I’m capable of doing this alone but having people actually contribute would be better then me just stressing myself. A few developers would be nice etc and I’m not the person who “keeps their code private” so I’d even make this open source if developers are fully okay with that.</p>

<p>well what i mean is like are you going to add your own unique features as in something totally different from what jagex has already done. all servers are basically the same just replicating jagex, not putting them down or anything just saying that itd be nicer if someone came up with something of their own for once ya know. atleast thats what im doing, embattled was doin it and froyoscape started but quit, so ima go all the way with it, i got enough support and team members that it should all work out good.<br>

              <p>I’m gathering some developers for a project which will soon be started on. I’m hoping to writing all the content from scratch and with the right developers I’m sure we could scramble something sexy!</p>
<p>All project details are currently unknown due to the fact nothing has been started and having a team to discuss the upcoming of the server I’m certain that we’ll produce something worth getting acknowledged. Enough said I’m considering a 503+ server (favorites) with a couple of 600/700+ features (not using any crappy 317 stuff) to create that uniqueness because we’re not Jagex, and no way going to create a remake.</p>
<p>Enough said here’s my sexy development/advertisement poster! (which is uncompleted and has like 1% with this topic, but it looked good?)</p>
