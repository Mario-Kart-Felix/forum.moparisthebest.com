<p>I run one of the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> World of Warcraft servers, runescape is like what… nothing. It’s just a little thing I made for when our WoW server is offline for updates. The <span class="hashtag">#1</span> runescape server has like what? 400 players lol? Try having 24,000.[/quote]</p>
<p>WoW = C++ and a completely different core structure.<br>
RSC = Java, different mechanics, etc.</p>
<p>I know, I used to host both as well. They are two completely different things.</p>

<p>Do you honestly think your server will last when other servers fix this DDoS problem? Also, I heard you got hit earlier. How many players do you have now?[/quote]</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be talking… your server is offline, very frequently. Also, we know who did the work for RSCPK (Hint: It isn’t you.).</p>

Yeah “Taking down there Server” I don’t take down peoples servers I just use bugs\dupes.<br>
When someone does a dupe\bug on my server and I find it out, I fix it within 3-10 minutes.

<p>Yeah that’s exactly what I’m saying. Don’t get into something you know nothing about. Most of these kids are just trying to make a name for themselves, not for the development of RSC servers. They bring up a server with no java edits and no idea how to code java and/or secure a server.<br>
That rule should be pretty standard.</p>
<p>Even if that server fails (I don’t know why I said IF. It will), they will always be able to say “yeah so I ran this server called blah blah, I’m somebody now!!1”. That shit is so old.</p>
