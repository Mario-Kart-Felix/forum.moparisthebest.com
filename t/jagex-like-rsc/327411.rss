    <title>Jagex-like RSC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-like-rsc/327411</link>
    <description>Elite Gaming is a group of people who run servers for games such as World of Warcraft and Runescape and soon to come Counter-Strike: Source. Anyways about the RSC server, we started hosting it because our staff at Elite Gaming use to play way back before RS2.

First group of people that join ill give you free stats and what not to get the economy going. And if you wanna PK ill give you the gear, pots, food ect.

It&#39;s not a big server, and we don&#39;t plan on being a big server as it&#39;s completely Jagex-like. But if it does happen to bring lots of people we have a dedicated host to support them.

If you feel like joining, please visit the url in my signature.

in no way did i compare them, All i did was point out the invalidity of the OP using WoW as a base for his RSC exploits.</p>

<p>Rsc != WoW, stability is stability whether its 1200 people or 700 people(which rsca has proven capable of holding). To compare the 2 is absurd.
