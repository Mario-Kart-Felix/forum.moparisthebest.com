    <description>hey ppl yesterday i went to bad, and i had a awsome Idea, and i wanna hear what u guys think of it.

oke so its like a gaming site, like www.spele.nl  u can click any game u want.

but what if it was like no games on there but webclients, and when u click on it it loads te webclient, and u can see the server features below it.

and then ofcourse ppl can upload their client.jar, ( every person gets a unique name jar name, ofc)

and then a server status checker check if it its online and it is accepted then, and below below 80% uptime it will be deleted.

and there are then 2 sides on the page, the Pk servers and Normal boss slaying skilling and training servers.

and ofc there is a gold section above of the page, 15 Pk servers and the left and 15 Normaln servers on the right.

and below the gold servers the other servers are, also there are only 3 pages with servers , so u have to re upload  so new fresh servers get on top of it for like 1 day , and then new ones come


tell me what u think of it guys 

it to bad i can create it my self, cuz i cant code php or html, to bad ;(

also have some picture&#39;s 
this is how the page looks like the interface the grey boxes have names of the webclinets free ppl uploaded

and the gold ones are for the payed ones,

and here is a picture how the page would look like if you opened one of those webclient, it has a like button and show u how many likes, and it has a little chat under it.

and under that the features of the server are, and pictures, and a story why u should join, also some info like forums

              <p>I thought this was exactly what the server status page was.  People post their servers, with descriptions, and you can click to play them immediately inside of MoparScape.  Soon you will be able to upload your own client to play in MoparScape as well, I just haven’t added that yet.</p>
