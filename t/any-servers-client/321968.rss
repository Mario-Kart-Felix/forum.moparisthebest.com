    <title>Any server&#39;s client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-servers-client/321968</link>
    <description>Well first of all, I want to let you know that I run on a VERY low-spec computer now.  The hard drive is maxxed at 10 gb, the processor is ~500 mhz, etc.

And recently I have enjoyed actually [b]playing[/b] rsps, but now everyone has their own client, and you can&#39;t test it before downloading.  Its a very annoying to download a client and discover the server offers no ideas, etc for my own developement.
And I&#39;m actually unaware of how this works.  But does anyone have a client with an ip/port changer, that will log on [almost?] any server.  Also, if you have the time, would you mind explaining how this works?  Preferably open source so I can remove anInt988++, anInt988 = 0, and if(anInt1278 &lt; -##).  I can use the class&gt;java decompiler if neccesary, but those events are just annoying :P [camera position moves over tiem lol].

Thank you so much in advance, and Merry Christmas!</description>
