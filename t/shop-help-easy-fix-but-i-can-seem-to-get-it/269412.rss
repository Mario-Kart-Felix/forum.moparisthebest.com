    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shop-help-easy-fix-but-i-can-seem-to-get-it/269412</link>
    <description>Heres What I Have In Shop.cfg
[code]shop = 4	Han&#39;s Skillcape Exchange			2	2	2678	1	2681	1	2684	1	2690	1	2696	1	2699	1	2702	1	2705	1	2708	1	2714	1	2717	1	2723	1	2726	1	2729	1	2732	1	2738	1[/code]
Heres What I Have In AutoSpawn.cfg
[code]spawn = 544	3097	3499	0	0	0	0	0	1	Shop[/code]
Heres What I Got In Client.java
[code]case 544
				Coords = true;
				Shop = 4;
				break;[/code]
But after i compile and restart the server my client dosnt actually &quot;freeze&quot; but the screen stays black and i can click most of the buttons. so i thought &quot;ok 1 of the skillcapes must not be in class8&quot;. so i tried to spawn em all with ::pickup and they all work fine. can anyone help me? Im using richscape.</description>
