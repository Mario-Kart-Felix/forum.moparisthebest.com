    <description>[font=Verdana]Now log into the router and go into &quot;advanced&quot; (at top of screen on mine). Then on the sidebar to the left click the &quot;gaming&quot; button (is only left side for me...) Then you need to make a new rule and fill in the blanks with this information:

Name: 1
IP address: 2
TCP Ports to open: 43594
UDP Ports to open:
Inbound Filter: Allow All
Schedule: Always[/font]

i type in my ip and i log into the router, but idk if its the wrong ip because when i click advanced i dont see the gaming tab, and the gaming tab i go to doesnt have the fill in the blanks, am i doing anything wrong?</description>
