    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-too-many-dev-teams/106787</link>
    <description>Hello everyday or few days i knotice anouther Development Team advertise, i want to know if other people have knoticed and do you rekon there is too many and that they should cut it down a bit.

Sorry if this is in wrong section im not sure if it should be in this section cause this is where the problem is related or the Questions section.
Do not flame me if im worng, i just ask that a mod move it if they will please, because its an honest mistake.
