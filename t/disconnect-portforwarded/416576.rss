    <title>Disconnect &amp; Portforwarded</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/disconnect-portforwarded/416576</link>
    <description>I have portforwarded my 317 server and I had put it on so some friends could test it with me, but suddenly after 2-3 minutes they totally disconnect. (Their client gets exit also) So I am wondering how this is getting caused, I&#39;ve checked EVERYTHING which had to be inflicting this. The only thing I guess it that I had less RAM while the server was online / portforwarded. Because I had done this before using Hamachi, but no problem was occured, only when portforwarded. (Only they get kicked, not me, also nothing is listed on the command prompt).</description>

              <p>That’s the problem, it doesn’t display ANYTHING, and as far as I know, closing the client completely has nothing to do with the server… Right?</p>

Find out why and maybe you can fix it. It would help if you told us if server displayed any messages.</p>
