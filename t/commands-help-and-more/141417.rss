    <description>Hi, basically, I&#39;ve started to make my own server. I want to know three main things;

 - How can I edit and create effects using the ::command thing. In other words, how would I go about making a starter kit (some armour and money) by inputting ::starter into the chat box. Also, how would I get a character to teleport by inputing ::varrock.

 - How can i get the NPC&#39;s I place around the map to fight back. At the moment, when I hit them, they just curl up and die.

 - How can I read and edit, mainly read the CLASS files in the Hybridscape folder.

If you could help me with this, I&#39;d be grateful. I&#39;m just a beginner and like all beginners I want to learn.
