[ul][center][size=20pt][b]Solve Security Issues in Windows XP[/b][/size]
by Ron[/center]

Do you not believe me? Think I&#39;m some crazy hacker? Think I&#39;m weird? Well ok then lol. All these tweaks are from websites such as www.TweakXP.com, www.TweakHound.com, www.WinGuides.com/windowsxp/, and www.MarkusJansson.net/exp.html so I&#39;m not just pulling these tweaks right out of my bum. All I have done is organized it, and put all the most efficient and compatable tweaks that will still keep your operating system very stable with very few problems. At the end of this tutorial you can scan your computer for open holes and such and I guarantee you that you will have about 20 or so holes fixed on XP. This tutorial is practically a nessecity if you don&#39;t have a firewallsuch as McAfee, Norton, or Zone Alarm.

WARNING: Please Create a system restore before even thinking about doing this tutorial. To run a system restore click on Start &gt; Program &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; Create a Restore Point.

Sorry for all the people that have XP Home and not the Pro version. Turns out if you give Microsoft more money they will include more security features in the Microsoft OS, but won&#39;t turn them on because they are a**holes. Anyways, all the Categories for each listing says if it&#39;s for XP Pro Only or XP Home/Pro which means for both. Now here&#39;s the tutorial. 

[b]-&gt; Closing MANY MANY Holes by tightening up Windows Registry &amp; Services[/b] - XP Home/Pro
[list]
[*] Just [url=http://goons.freepgs.com/downloads/SecureRegistry_and_Services.zip]download this .zip[/url] file and run the .reg and .bat file. :)
[*] After running both of them. Reboot your computer.
[/list]
.

[b]-&gt; Network Connection Security[/b] - XP Home/Pro[list]
[*] Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Network Connections &gt; Right click on Local Area Connection 2 &gt; Click on Properties.
[*] On the General Tab, uncheck every checkbox except for Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
[*] Now click on Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and click on Properties.
[*] On the General tab, click on Advanced at the bottom. Advanced TCP/IP Settings should pop up. 
[*] Click on the Options tab, then click on TCP/IP Filtering and click on Properties. 
[*] Uncheck Enable TCP/IP Filtering (All Adapters).
[/list]

[b]-&gt; Change Remote Scheduled Tasks[/b] - XP Home/Pro
Instead of having to wait for the remote scheduled tasks, which is useless information to anyone who is not a system administrator remotely configuring scheduled tasks, you can disable this feature.[list]
[*] Go to Start &gt; Run &gt; regedit &gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; CurrentVersion &gt; Explorer &gt; RemoteComputer &gt; NameSpace
[*] In the NameSpace folder you will find two entries. One is &quot;{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}&quot; which tells Explorer to show printers shared on the remote machine. The other, &quot;{D6277990-4C6A-11CF-8D87-00AA0060F5BF}&quot;, tells Explorer to show remote scheduled tasks. This is the one that you should delete.
[*] If you have no use for viewing remote shared printers and are really only interested in shared files, consider deleting the printers key, &quot;{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}&quot;, as well. This will also boost your browsing speed.
[/list]

[b]-&gt; SafeXP[/b] - XP Home/Pro
Safe XP is a small executable program that does not require installation. It brings up a window with many settings to secure your computer such as disabling many vulnerabilities that my tutorials nor system mechanic could have done. It&#39;s a very useful program, and it&#39;s only 324 or so KBs 
[list]
[*] [url=http://www.theorica.net/download.htm]Download Safe XP[/url]
[*] Run the SafeXP.exe, move your mouse over any check box, read the description in the status bar at the bottom of the window, and check which one you like.
[*] If you&#39;re lost and don&#39;t know which one to check. [url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=BLFV1VDB]Download my settings[/url] and then just click on &quot;Restore Settings from File&quot; on the bottom left of the SafeXP screen once you have loaded it, and then find the location of the SafeXP.dat file and click ok.
[*] Click on Apply and you&#39;re done!
[/list]

[b]-&gt; Firefox, an alternative to Internet Explorer[/b] - XP Home/Pro
This program is the best web browser on the internet and clears soooo many holes by using this browser instead. Plus it has many positives and few negatives, while Internet Explorer has many negatives and few positives. More info here on [url=http://goons.freepgs.com/stuff.php?p=Mozilla_Firefox_vs_Internet_Explorer]Mozilla Firefox vs. Internet Explorer[/url].

[b]-&gt; User Accounts[/b] - XP Pro Only
By default, the Guest account password is blank. Make it something difficult, such as a combination of letters and numbers, preferably not based on dictionary words. [list]
[*] Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Computer Management &gt; Local Users and Groups &gt; Highlight User Account &gt; right-click and click on Set Password.
[*] Remove/Delete any unused accounts, especially any &#39;remote assistance&#39; accounts.
[*] Disable the Guest account since you can&#39;t delete it.
[*] Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Local Security Policy &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options Account &gt; Rename Guest Account - Double click and rename the account to something weird like Fa98sasjd9as (this is where the weirdo leet language comes into play, but only here).
[/list]

[b]-&gt; Remote Machines[/b] - XP Pro Only
If you do not need to connect to your computer from a remote machine, be sure to turn this off.
[list]
[*] Go to Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Local Security Policy &gt; Local Policies &gt; User rights Assessment &gt; &quot;Access this computer from the network&quot; and then delete all users and groups. This should now be blank.
[*] Click on &quot;Deny access to this computer from the network&quot; - this should include all users and groups. Double click on the policy, click Add User or group, click Advanced, click Find Now, highlight all the accounts and click OK.
[*] Under System Properties &gt; Remote &gt; Turn off Remote Desktop and Remote invitations
[/list]

[b]-&gt; Reboot your Computer[/b] - XP Home/Pro[list]
[*] Check to see if your internet works.
[*] Check to see if you can have other programs connect to the internet.
[*] If you can&#39;t, then post in this topic for help. I&#39;ll be able to figure your problem and help you find a solution.
[/list]

[b]-&gt; Windows Updates[/b] - XP Home/Pro
I can&#39;t stress this enough. You NEED to do windows updates. Microsoft sucks so much, but everytime they issue out a patch or whatever, download it immediately. Every now and then just check for Windows Updates by clicking [url=http://update.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/]here[/url] or going to your Start Menu and clicking on Windows Updates right above Programs. If there are any updates to install, download and install them, and then reboot your computer once again.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Don&#39;t be lazy. 
Don&#39;t be late.
Keep your Computer, up to date.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]-&gt; Run Online Security Checks[/b] - XP Home/Pro - Use IE for this only. Sorry Firefox fans.[list]
[*] [url=http://www.hackerwhacker.com]Hacker Whacker&#39;s Sweet Security Scans[/url]
[*] [url=https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2]GRC - Shields Up[/url]
[*] [url=http://onlinecheck.emsisoft.com/en]Emsisoft&#39;s Security Checks[/url]
[*] [url=http://scan.sygatetech.com/]Sygate Tech&#39;s Security Checks[/url]
[*] [url=http://housecall.trendmicro.com/]TrendMicro&#39;s Online Virus Scan[/url]

<p>Windows should supply us with a Windows Update to fix all of this, but of course Windows and security programs like firewalls are all conspiring to make money off us.</p>
<ol>
<li>Windows leaves holes open on purpose, it sucks, and everyone knows it. It’s a monopoly so we have to use it or we can’t get as many programs or whatever.</li>
<li>Firewalls are made and created to block viruses and crap from ports that shouldn’t even be open in Microsoft.</li>
<li>Firewalls make money off it. 10% cut probably goes to Microsoft.</li>
<li>AntiSpyware/AntiVirus programs are made and created to fix crap not blocked by the firewall and of course microsoft has its legs wide open and lets you get fucked.</li>
<li>AntiSpyware/AntiVirus make money off it. ANother 10% cut goes to Microsoft.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s all a conspiracy. SO FIX THE SHIT! :)[br][size=1]Posted at: July 14, 2006, 05:27:05 PM[/size][hr]Added .reg file and added more security tweaks within the .reg file! Now all you have to do is download that file, and open it up, and it will do most of the work for you. I’m still working on a way to shut off those services without you having to do it by hand. Enjoy the revision of this tutorial. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

If you usd this tutorial, I would go over it again. Just to make sure everything is still intact. I listed my sources and I added some other things on how to back up your registry.</p>
<p>I also fixed an error under LanMan. I’m very sorry, I think I just typed in the wrong number. It’s fixed now so please go over it and change your registry. It’s imperative that you do so if you have Windows XP.</p>

<p>Do you not believe me? Think I’m some crazy hacker? Think I’m weird? Well ok then lol. All these tweaks are from websites such as <a href="http://www.TweakXP.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.TweakXP.com</a>, <a href="http://www.TweakHound.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.TweakHound.com</a>, <a href="http://www.WinGuides.com/windowsxp/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.WinGuides.com/windowsxp/</a>, and <a href="http://www.MarkusJansson.net/exp.html" rel="nofollow noopener">www.MarkusJansson.net/exp.html</a> so I’m not just pulling these tweaks right out of my bum. All I have done is organized it, and put all the most efficient and compatable tweaks that will still keep your operating system very stable with very few problems. At the end of this tutorial you can scan your computer for open holes and such and I guarantee you that you will have about 20 or so holes fixed on XP. This tutorial is practically a nessecity if you don’t have a firewallsuch as McAfee, Norton, or Zone Alarm.</p>
<p>WARNING: Please Create a system restore before even thinking about doing this tutorial. To run a system restore click on Start &gt; Program &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; Create a Restore Point.</p>
<p>Sorry for all the people that have XP Home and not the Pro version. Turns out if you give Microsoft more money they will include more security features in the Microsoft OS, but won’t turn them on because they are a**holes. Anyways, all the Categories for each listing says if it’s for XP Pro Only or XP Home/Pro which means for both. Now here’s the tutorial.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; Closing MANY MANY Holes by tightening up Windows Registry &amp; Services</span> - XP Home/Pro<br>
[list]<br>
[<em>] Just <a href="http://goons.freepgs.com/downloads/SecureRegistry_and_Services.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">download this .zip</a> file and run the .reg and .bat file. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
[</em>] After running both of them. Reboot your computer.<br>
[/list]<br>
.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; Network Connection Security</span> - XP Home/Pro[list]<br>
[<em>] Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Network Connections &gt; Right click on Local Area Connection 2 &gt; Click on Properties.<br>
[</em>] On the General Tab, uncheck every checkbox except for Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).<br>
[<em>] Now click on Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and click on Properties.<br>
[</em>] On the General tab, click on Advanced at the bottom. Advanced TCP/IP Settings should pop up.<br>
[<em>] Click on the Options tab, then click on TCP/IP Filtering and click on Properties.<br>
[</em>] Uncheck Enable TCP/IP Filtering (All Adapters).<br>
[/list]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; Change Remote Scheduled Tasks</span> - XP Home/Pro<br>
Instead of having to wait for the remote scheduled tasks, which is useless information to anyone who is not a system administrator remotely configuring scheduled tasks, you can disable this feature.[list]<br>
[<em>] Go to Start &gt; Run &gt; regedit &gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; CurrentVersion &gt; Explorer &gt; RemoteComputer &gt; NameSpace<br>
[</em>] In the NameSpace folder you will find two entries. One is “{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}” which tells Explorer to show printers shared on the remote machine. The other, “{D6277990-4C6A-11CF-8D87-00AA0060F5BF}”, tells Explorer to show remote scheduled tasks. This is the one that you should delete.<br>
[*] If you have no use for viewing remote shared printers and are really only interested in shared files, consider deleting the printers key, “{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}”, as well. This will also boost your browsing speed.<br>
[/list]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; SafeXP</span> - XP Home/Pro<br>
Safe XP is a small executable program that does not require installation. It brings up a window with many settings to secure your computer such as disabling many vulnerabilities that my tutorials nor system mechanic could have done. It’s a very useful program, and it’s only 324 or so KBs<br>
[list]<br>
[<em>] <a href="http://www.theorica.net/download.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download Safe XP</a><br>
[</em>] Run the SafeXP.exe, move your mouse over any check box, read the description in the status bar at the bottom of the window, and check which one you like.<br>
[<em>] If you’re lost and don’t know which one to check. <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=BLFV1VDB" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download my settings</a> and then just click on “Restore Settings from File” on the bottom left of the SafeXP screen once you have loaded it, and then find the location of the SafeXP.dat file and click ok.<br>
[</em>] Click on Apply and you’re done!<br>
[/list]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; Firefox, an alternative to Internet Explorer</span> - XP Home/Pro<br>
This program is the best web browser on the internet and clears soooo many holes by using this browser instead. Plus it has many positives and few negatives, while Internet Explorer has many negatives and few positives. More info here on <a href="http://goons.freepgs.com/stuff.php?p=Mozilla_Firefox_vs_Internet_Explorer" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Mozilla Firefox vs. Internet Explorer</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; User Accounts</span> - XP Pro Only<br>
By default, the Guest account password is blank. Make it something difficult, such as a combination of letters and numbers, preferably not based on dictionary words. [list]<br>
[<em>] Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Computer Management &gt; Local Users and Groups &gt; Highlight User Account &gt; right-click and click on Set Password.<br>
[</em>] Remove/Delete any unused accounts, especially any ‘remote assistance’ accounts.<br>
[<em>] Disable the Guest account since you can’t delete it.<br>
[</em>] Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Local Security Policy &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options Account &gt; Rename Guest Account - Double click and rename the account to something weird like Fa98sasjd9as (this is where the weirdo leet language comes into play, but only here).<br>
[/list]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; Remote Machines</span> - XP Pro Only<br>
If you do not need to connect to your computer from a remote machine, be sure to turn this off.<br>
[list]<br>
[<em>] Go to Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Local Security Policy &gt; Local Policies &gt; User rights Assessment &gt; “Access this computer from the network” and then delete all users and groups. This should now be blank.<br>
[</em>] Click on “Deny access to this computer from the network” - this should include all users and groups. Double click on the policy, click Add User or group, click Advanced, click Find Now, highlight all the accounts and click OK.<br>
[*] Under System Properties &gt; Remote &gt; Turn off Remote Desktop and Remote invitations<br>
[/list]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; Reboot your Computer</span> - XP Home/Pro[list]<br>
[<em>] Check to see if your internet works.<br>
[</em>] Check to see if you can have other programs connect to the internet.<br>
[*] If you can’t, then post in this topic for help. I’ll be able to figure your problem and help you find a solution.<br>
[/list]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; Windows Updates</span> - XP Home/Pro<br>
I can’t stress this enough. You NEED to do windows updates. Microsoft sucks so much, but everytime they issue out a patch or whatever, download it immediately. Every now and then just check for Windows Updates by clicking <a href="http://update.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> or going to your Start Menu and clicking on Windows Updates right above Programs. If there are any updates to install, download and install them, and then reboot your computer once again.</p>
<blockquote>Don't be lazy. 
Don't be late.
Keep your Computer, up to date.</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; Run Online Security Checks</span> - XP Home/Pro - Use IE for this only. Sorry Firefox fans.[list]<br>
