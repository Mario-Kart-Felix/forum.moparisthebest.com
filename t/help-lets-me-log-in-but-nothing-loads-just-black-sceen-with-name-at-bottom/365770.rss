    <description>I get this whenever i try to login, on my client it just shows my name a the bottom at the chat box where none of the login messages show, and the inventory is black as well as the map and screen.

This is what the Source &quot;Run&quot; shows after a little bit, it says &quot;connection lost - attempting to restablish&quot; bla bla bla.
