    <title>ServerStatus Page Not Working Successfully For Me</title>

    <description>EDIT: Just noticed my IP changed last night, found out what the problem was, a moderator can lock this thread now.)

Hello, I have turned my server online and tried to send in a request to the server status page.

However after I send it in it says that my server is offline, but it is definitely online.

Could I please get some help? I don&#39;t know what is going on.</description>
