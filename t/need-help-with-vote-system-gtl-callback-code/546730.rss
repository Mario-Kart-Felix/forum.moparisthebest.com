<p>Rarely anyone on these forums knows how to place a cache in their c: drive to be honest, but good luck finding someone to help you! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I’m just going to go ahead and report your post as spam. As that is all it is. The point of this section is 1 of 2 things: Help, or get help. You’re doing neither of them here. Instead you’re actually criticizing the users (as a whole). I can guarantee there are plenty of users here that are more than capable of “placing a cache in their C:/ drive”, I can also guarantee there are users here that can code an entire server from scratch. That is a hell of a lot more than I’ve ever seen you do, so you have no room to talk.</p>
<p>OP:<br>
Can you post more information on your issue? Are you having an issue getting/making the callback links? or what?<br>
GTLVote script made it rather easy, and you don’t even have to modify any PHP to add links…</p>
