<p>There were resets only because Owners had to fix the duping. It’s all fixed now.</p>

<p>If voting returns 25m think how horrible the economy is you buffoon.<br>
[/quote]It depends on yopur total level, If you’re maxed you get 25m, if you just vote with no skills you get like 200k.</p>

</aside>
<p>So they’re not balancing the economy? Think if someone who’s up and coming votes every day and gets 1m, then a maxed user votes every day and gets 25m after 10 days the not as advanced user will have 25m and the maxed user will have 250m? Lol…</p>
<p>Take it on a 30 day month for example, if the user who gets 1m votes every day and gets 30m, the maxed user will have three quarters of a billion.<br>
[/quote]Well that’s why it will inspire people to skill. Our players aren’t complaining.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>An ex player just complained about economy resets. Economy resets are performed due to an unbalanced economy and if they think that’s going to balance it out then they’re down right retarded.<br>
[/quote]There was a reset because of duping. Learn to read.<br>
Everything is fixed atm. And if you do nothing but hate then leave.[/quote]</p>
<p>I owned a server around the time pwnxile first came out and I had over 600 online within 4 months. They’ve only just reached that, if they focused on their economy they could have a much better server.</p>
