    <description>[size=12pt]Hey guys!
I need some help with my server. I&#39;m thinking of making a new minigame like nazi zombies and there are a couple things I could use some help with![/size]

[size=12pt]The first thing I need to know how to do is make a menu like the one in the Fight Caves that displays the number of waves left and the amount of zombies left to kill. I think it is something like[/size]

[code=java]public void hspanel() {
setInterfaceWalkable(15892);
sendQuest(&quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, 15894);
sendQuest(&quot;Game starts in: &quot;+PlayerHandler.hswait+&quot;&quot;, 15895);
sendQuest(&quot;Points: &quot;+hspoints+&quot;&quot;, 15897);
sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15898);sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15899);
sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15900);sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15901);
sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15896);sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15902);
sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15903);sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15904);
sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15905);sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15906);       
 }[/code]

But I need to know how to customize it and make it stay up until you leave.


The next thing I need to know is how to make the npc&#39;s spawn at the different times (Like waves) and come after the player(s).


I think I have the mystery box down and everything plus I know how to makeGlobalObjects and that, but how could I make it so if you use a hammer on the barrier it gets fixed and when the zombies walk into it it gets damaged?

[code=Java]  if (useItemID == ITEMID &amp;&amp; atObjectID == OBJECTID)                                {
                                teleportToX = XXXX; 
                                teleportToY = YYYY;
                                sendMessage(&quot;---- YOUR MESSAGE -----&quot;); 
                                sendMessage(&quot;---- YOUR MESSAGE 2 ---&quot;); 
                               }
[/code]
I think that would work with the barriers but I don&#39;t know how to make them deteriorate and be repaired.

And how could I make it so that killing a zombie gives you &quot;Zombie Points&quot;? I was wondering if I could use the &quot;Pk Points&quot; from this but make them &quot;Zombie Points&quot;?

I don&#39;t think I could make the guns on the walls unless I made an item on object where you used points on a walls object ID and got a weapon etc.

Thanks in advance,
