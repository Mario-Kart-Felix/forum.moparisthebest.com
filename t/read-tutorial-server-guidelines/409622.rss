    <title>[READ] Tutorial/Server Guidelines</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/read-tutorial-server-guidelines/409622</link>
    <description>[b]What this tutorial is meant to teach:[/b]
This tutorial is here to teach users on how to properly submit a useful tutorial. It has become the norm to simply post Copy &amp; Paste snippets with small information for the users who are using the tutorial to &quot;learn&quot;. To put an end to this, I hope this tutorial can teach people on how to construct a proper tutorial for this section.

Please note that this tutorial/server guidelines only applies to [b]RSPS only[/b] and should not be applied to anything else.

Before starting your tutorial please read this topic [size=32pt][url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,350844.0.html]HERE[/url][/size] and the use the links within that thread and continue further reading.

[b]What?! Why do I have to read so much stuff?[/b]
The answer lies simply in the fact that it will help you comprehend how your tutorial should be laid out, what it should contain, and how it should be written. If you cannot read a few simple topics, how could you even produce your own topic in a way that would allow others to gain knowledge or ideas from so they can understand it?

[b]I don&#39;t want to write a tutorial but I can&#39;t find a tutorial for a specific source that I&#39;m using?[/b]
Frankly, you shouldn&#39;t be looking for tutorials on how to do something for a RuneScape Private Server if you can&#39;t understand the JAVA programming language and how it works. Programming takes studying which means more reading!

[b]I&#39;d rather just take snippets of codes and bring up my server so I can start collecting donations[/b]
In all honesty, that kind of thinking is shunned by the more intelligent programmers around the world. Although it costs money to keep a dedicated server online, nothing should be done for the pure purpose of profit. However it is not illegal (per say) but it will not make you a better person overall and you won&#39;t be learning anything out of it and you will continue to be as ignorant as you started. Not good right?

[b]So if I want to write a useful tutorial or program a server, what should I do?[/b]
The number one thing you should do is find a programming language which you find is suitable for you. You can find one [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages]here[/url] but note that not all languages is meant for programming a server. If you want to narrow down the list of languages to research I can name a few that has been used to program a RuneScape Private Server over the years:

[ul][li]ruby[/li]
[li]JAVA[/li]
[li]C#[/li]
[li]C++[/li][/ul]

[size=5pt]note: I have only listed those that I&#39;ve seen so far, if you know any more possible languages in which COULD/HAVE be/been used to program a server, tell me.[/size]

After you find the language you like, start learning everything you can and don&#39;t stop!

[b]I feel like I know as much as I can to start programming or writing tutorials, what should I do?[/b]
Well first should take a look this thread [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,498106.0.html]HERE[/url]. If you don&#39;t understand anything written there, you probably shouldn&#39;t start writing tutorials or programming a server yet.

[b]I understood what was in the link, I started programming a server and it&#39;s gone by well so far. I want to write a tutorial to contribute to the community, how do I do so?[/b]
Well if you&#39;ve gotten this far, you&#39;ll know that tutorials shouldn&#39;t be written by the source you use. Everything you program (which is usually JAVA on this site) can be implemented into other sources and even other languages. If you don&#39;t know how, you should stop programming right now and continue studying how to program with the language you chose and/or the language that the other source uses. If you do, then you should know that a tutorial is not only meant to teach someone how to do something but give someone and idea using the method you approached with that tutorial. The tutorial should [b]NOT[/b] teach how to program something within a specific source. It should be detailed and documented regardless of method/variable names.

I think that sums it up, if there&#39;s anything you think I should add to the tutorial, just tell me and I&#39;ll see if it should go here.

<p>Before starting your tutorial please read this topic [size=32pt]<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,350844.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a>[/size] and the use the links within that thread and continue further reading.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What?! Why do I have to read so much stuff?</span><br>
The answer lies simply in the fact that it will help you comprehend how your tutorial should be laid out, what it should contain, and how it should be written. If you cannot read a few simple topics, how could you even produce your own topic in a way that would allow others to gain knowledge or ideas from so they can understand it?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I don’t want to write a tutorial but I can’t find a tutorial for a specific source that I’m using?</span><br>
Frankly, you shouldn’t be looking for tutorials on how to do something for a RuneScape Private Server if you can’t understand the JAVA programming language and how it works. Programming takes studying which means more reading!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I’d rather just take snippets of codes and bring up my server so I can start collecting donations</span><br>
In all honesty, that kind of thinking is shunned by the more intelligent programmers around the world. Although it costs money to keep a dedicated server online, nothing should be done for the pure purpose of profit. However it is not illegal (per say) but it will not make you a better person overall and you won’t be learning anything out of it and you will continue to be as ignorant as you started. Not good right?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">So if I want to write a useful tutorial or program a server, what should I do?</span><br>
The number one thing you should do is find a programming language which you find is suitable for you. You can find one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> but note that not all languages is meant for programming a server. If you want to narrow down the list of languages to research I can name a few that has been used to program a RuneScape Private Server over the years:</p>
<p>[ul][li]ruby[/li]<br>
[li]JAVA[/li]<br>
[li]C#[/li]<br>
[li]C++[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[size=5pt]note: I have only listed those that I’ve seen so far, if you know any more possible languages in which COULD/HAVE be/been used to program a server, tell me.[/size]</p>
<p>After you find the language you like, start learning everything you can and don’t stop!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I feel like I know as much as I can to start programming or writing tutorials, what should I do?</span><br>
Well first should take a look this thread <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,498106.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a>. If you don’t understand anything written there, you probably shouldn’t start writing tutorials or programming a server yet.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I understood what was in the link, I started programming a server and it’s gone by well so far. I want to write a tutorial to contribute to the community, how do I do so?</span><br>
Well if you’ve gotten this far, you’ll know that tutorials shouldn’t be written by the source you use. Everything you program (which is usually JAVA on this site) can be implemented into other sources and even other languages. If you don’t know how, you should stop programming right now and continue studying how to program with the language you chose and/or the language that the other source uses. If you do, then you should know that a tutorial is not only meant to teach someone how to do something but give someone and idea using the method you approached with that tutorial. The tutorial should <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> teach how to program something within a specific source. It should be detailed and documented regardless of method/variable names.</p>
<p>I think that sums it up, if there’s anything you think I should add to the tutorial, just tell me and I’ll see if it should go here.</p>
