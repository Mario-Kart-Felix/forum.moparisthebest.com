    <title>Impossible question? :o 562</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/impossible-question-o-562/370935</link>
    <description>Alright, in my 562 source file.  The source is runeslay, and i can&#39;t seem to get rid of it.  When you log in, as a new account, it will always say im new to runeslay.  I have serched this whole website.  Did a serch on the client and server, I got no results.  I even asked some coder and he didn&#39;t know.  (guess he wasn&#39;t much of a coder anyway then) XD.  If you could please solve this problem you are a master at RSPS coding! 

Thank you very much for all your time.</description>

<p>oh, i thought editing the server a lot wasn’t really leeching.  I thought of it as a base. :S  sorry.</p>

</aside>
<p>Even if you edit the server a lot, You still have to give credits to whoever else helped work on it,<br>
Otherwise it is leeching no matter how much you modify it.</p>
<p>Also I don’t see how you can edit it a lot if you don’t event know how to change the name.</p>
