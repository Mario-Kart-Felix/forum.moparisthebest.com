    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/battlescape-idk-what-base-that-is-need-help-with-a-few-things/381891</link>
    <description>Hey guys this is a list of what i need help with for this base since its pretty different from what delta was which is the one i was used to coding so


1. making a certain monster (id 4160 i think) reduce prayer when it hits you...like amount hit /2 = prayer loss
2.adding dragonfire shield, need model and how to add it to server although i can probaly find model online
3.adding a custom quest
4.deleting a monster that isnt in npc.cfg, autospawn, npcdrops.java, NPC.java, or npchandler &gt;.&gt;...its a mammoth that is in lumbridge and when it walks it glitches like a bomb hit it... and i cant find it in any file lol &lt;-- doing searching so i probably can get this one eventually, and its not that important
5.Somebody please tell me what base battlescape is counted as... the files are not organized like delta, and the tutorials for PI dont fit, and i know nothing about shard or the other ones so idk.
6.Thanks for any help given xD 


edit- still need help =\</description>
