    <title>Can anyone read the rules?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-anyone-read-the-rules/71596</link>
    <description>This question is directed to everyone posting in this section.

Why don&#39;t you all read the rules?
If you are posting a question having to do with a server post in the Server Development/Help
If you are posting a question having to do with clients post in the Client Hacking Section.
If you are posting a question about the MoparScape client/webclient post HERE
If you are posting a misc. question post here.

If you don&#39;t want to think of it as doing the RIGHT THING, think of it as your question will be answered quicker</description>
