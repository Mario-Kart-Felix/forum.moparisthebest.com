    <description>I&#39;m not much of a gfx artist, so I was wondering if someone could make me a pretty signature... Doesn&#39;t have to be of any specif theme, just has to be nice, cool and stylish  Just surprise me, and erm, dunno what the dimensions are these days, but I&#39;d like something not too big in height...

Ok, i need a nice picture for my Forum, with my name in it
Name is: 0BbY
Can someone make it for me?
I dont care what one, it need to be a cool one 

Thanks, 0BbY/Moerin</description>

<p>the only problem i have with that is the circle is not centered so it is annoying the hell outta me.</p>
<p>Also so you have no specific style you want? so it could be anything? ill probably make something just screwing around tomorrow and post it…</p>
