    <title>Setting timer Bump</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-timer-bump/552216</link>
    <description>I need help setting a small timer for my projectiles in my dark bow code, so that 1 arrow hits after another instead of the same time.. if this don&#39;t make any sense go look at a video on youtube (Rushing with dark bow) you can see what i mean on how it hits.. as it comes out of the dark bow.

[code]case 11235: // dark bow	
			c.usingBow = true;
			c.dbowSpec = true;
			c.rangeItemUsed = c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows];
			c.getItems().deleteArrow();
			c.getItems().deleteArrow();
			if (c.playerIndex &gt; 0) {
				c.getItems().dropArrowPlayer();
			} else if(c.npcIndex &gt; 0) {
				c.getItems().dropArrowNpc();
			}
			c.lastWeaponUsed = weapon;
			c.hitDelay = 3;
			c.startAnimation(426);
			c.projectileStage = 1;
			c.gfx100(c.getCombat().getRangeStartGFX());
			c.hitDelay = c.getCombat().getHitDelay(i, c.getItems().getItemName(c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon]).toLowerCase());
			if (c.fightMode == 2)
				c.attackTimer--;
			if (c.playerIndex &gt; 0)
				c.getCombat().fireProjectilePlayer();
			else if (c.npcIndex &gt; 0)
				c.getCombat().fireProjectileNpc();
			c.specAccuracy = 1.85;
			c.specDamage = 1.65;
		break;
		}[/code]</description>

<p>The reason the arrows still hit at the same time is because you threw all the code into the case…</p>
<p>If you recall, I stated that the server runs on a 600ms tick.<br>
You need to use that in order for this to work.</p>
<p>This is usually frowned upon, but for this to work you need to use the process() method of your Client.java</p>
<p>The reason for this is because that method is executed every tick, so the timer will be checked each tick. You will need to make sure the player is using the special (You have 2 booleans for that… “usingBow” and “dbowSpec”) for the bow, otherwise every player will be shooting arrows as long as they’re in game.</p>
<p>What you should do is create a method for the timer in your client class, and then use it in the process method.<br>
The first two things you should check are the booleans. Then check that the player is still in combat and has arrows.</p>
<p>As for making sure it doesn’t run more than twice:<br>
if you declare the long “lastMessage” in the Player or Client class, you can do something like this:</p>
<p><code>        if (c.lastMessage &lt; System.currentTimeMillis() &amp;&amp; (c.lastMessage &gt; -1)) {
                c.lastMessage = c.lastMessage == 0 ? (System.currentTimeMillis() + DBOW_DELAY) : -1;
        }</code><br>
When you declare a long, it will by default be 0. 0 is obviously greater than -1, so that’s 1 run. Then it checks if the value is 0, and on first run it is. If it is, it will set the value to the current time plus your delay (Clearly above 0). On second run (key work: second), it will set the value to -1, as c.lastMessage is no longer set to 0.</p>

<p>Why did your code suddenly change so dramatically? You went from using a timer to a task (What we originally said to use).<br>
Also, you don’t put a task into process() of client.java. The point of using process was to mimic what that task does, which is executing code at timed intervals.</p>
<p>Create a method in combat assistant that is for handling the dragon bow special. It’ll handle removing the arrows and the gfx and etc etc.<br>
Place the EventManager code in there.<br>
Place the code you want to run every X milliseconds within the execute method of the EventManager.</p>
<p>Another thing: I said you should use <span class="bbcode-i">CycleEvents</span> because the EventManager doesn’t run in sync with the server. This can cause issues.[/quote]</p>
<p>Threw it in meleeSpecial (aka) “CombatAssistance for me” still will not work right, any other help?</p>

<p>So i understand where your getting at this is much better thank you. As you explain more it helps me understand how to write something like this, here’s another example of how i think it would sort of would be probably not right but im making effort to figure it out.</p>

<p>Next, you don’t need to subtract the delay variable from the System.currentTimeMillis(). You need to make sure the variable you’re using to save the time of the last message sent is the System.currentTimeMillis() plus how long you want it to wait before the next one sends.</p>

<p>So do I need to add in projectiles, gfx, anim’s or any of that sort? or does the code automatically know that the d’bow is using all of that already? Cause it’s going to have to be a timer for both projectiles if i’m not mistaken cause if it were just for one then it would probably do the same thing it does now.</p>
<p>Here’s what i came up with it compiled no error’s but both arrows still hit at the same time.</p>
<p>[code]case 11235: // dark bow	<br>
c.usingBow = true;<br>
c.dbowSpec = true;<br>
c.rangeItemUsed = c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows];<br>
c.getItems().deleteArrow();<br>
c.getItems().deleteArrow();<br>
long lastMessage = 0;<br>
final int DBOW_DELAY = 1200;</p>
<pre><code>		if (lastMessage &lt; System.currentTimeMillis()) {
            lastMessage = System.currentTimeMillis() + DBOW_DELAY;

Okay so here is what i’m thinking, first off the code is either going to go to rangeData.java or it’ll be in player.java second the code will start off with something like this?</p>
<p>[code]if (System.currentTimeMillis() - dbowSpec<br>
c.playerEquipment[c.playerCombat] 11235</p>
<pre><code>		}
	}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>[/quote]<br>
The code would probably be more fitting in something like CombatAssistant, or the file that handles literally every other special attack…</p>
<p>And no. You would not start with “Something like that”. Because something like that wouldn’t compile. You’re missing a lot of the components to even make a complete if statement.</p>
<p>I wrote the following code <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Using an online Java IDE</a>, the two classes are an example of a timer using System.currentTimeMillis().</p>
<p>[code=java]public class HelloWorld {<br>
// Ignore below this, it’s just initializing the thread.<br>
public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
Thread t = new Thread(new Example(1000));<br>
t.start();<br>
}//Ignore above this</p>
<pre><code>private static class Example implements Runnable {
	private long lastMessage;// Take note of the 2 variables I use to setup the timer. NOTE: Your "delay" variable would never change, so you could make it a constant.
	private long delay;
	// Ignore below this line
	public Example() {
		this.delay = 500;
		this.lastMessage = System.currentTimeMillis() + this.delay;
	}

	public Example(int delay) {
		this.delay = delay;
		this.lastMessage = System.currentTimeMillis() + this.delay;
	}//Ignore above, except that the lastMessage value is being set to System.currentTimeMillis() + the value of the delay

	@Override
	public void run() {
		while (true) {//Ignore
			if (lastMessage &lt; System.currentTimeMillis()) {// This is what you should be worried about
				lastMessage = System.currentTimeMillis() + delay;
				System.out.println("Hello. This is a timed message that sends every " + this.delay + "ms.");
			}// This is what you should be worried about
		}//Ignore
	}

}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]<br>
Basically, your timer comes down to these small components:</p>
<p><code>	private long lastMessage;
	private long delay;
//
	if (lastMessage &lt; System.currentTimeMillis()) {
		lastMessage = System.currentTimeMillis() + delay;
	}</code></p>
<p>Every time the “lastMessage” variable is less than the value of the System’s current time in milliseconds, it executes the code in the if statement. For the timer to work properly, you must reset the “lastMessage” variable (In this example) to the System’s current time <span class="bbcode-b">PLUS</span> how long you want to wait.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> Server’s run on a 600 millisecond ‘tick’, so you will <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> be able to time it down to the last millisecond. You will have to do it based on ticks (1 tick = 600ms, 2 ticks = 1200ms, so on).[/quote]</p>
<p>So my timer for dbow would go in meleeSpecial along with the stuff that deals with special attacks ect…<br>
as for the coding the “delay” becomes a number or “dbow” confirming its the item your going to be using. The “ms” becomes 1000millisseconds or whatever you want it to be and lastMessage would become dbowSpec stating that your using dbow special?</p>
<p>[code] if (lastMessage &lt; System.currentTimeMillis()) {// This is what you should be worried about<br>
lastMessage = System.currentTimeMillis() + delay;<br>
System.out.println("Hello. This is a timed message that sends every " + this.delay + “ms.”);<br>
}// This is what you should be worried about<br>
}//Ignore<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>    }
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>[code] if (dbowSpec &lt; System.currentTimeMillis()) {// This is what you should be worried about<br>
dbowSpec = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000;<br>
System.out.println("Hello. This is a timed message that sends every " + this.delay + “ms.”);<br>
}// This is what you should be worried about<br>
}//Ignore<br>
}</p>

<p>The code would probably be more fitting in something like CombatAssistant, or the file that handles literally every other special attack…</p>
<p>And no. You would not start with “Something like that”. Because something like that wouldn’t compile. You’re missing a lot of the components to even make a complete if statement.</p>
<p>I wrote the following code <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Using an online Java IDE</a>, the two classes are an example of a timer using System.currentTimeMillis().</p>
<p>[code=java]public class HelloWorld {<br>
// Ignore below this, it’s just initializing the thread.<br>
public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
Thread t = new Thread(new Example(1000));<br>
t.start();<br>
}//Ignore above this</p>
<pre><code>private static class Example implements Runnable {
	private long lastMessage;// Take note of the 2 variables I use to setup the timer. NOTE: Your "delay" variable would never change, so you could make it a constant.
	private long delay;
	// Ignore below this line
	public Example() {
		this.delay = 500;
		this.lastMessage = System.currentTimeMillis() + this.delay;
	}

	public Example(int delay) {
		this.delay = delay;
		this.lastMessage = System.currentTimeMillis() + this.delay;
	}//Ignore above, except that the lastMessage value is being set to System.currentTimeMillis() + the value of the delay

	@Override
	public void run() {
		while (true) {//Ignore
			if (lastMessage &lt; System.currentTimeMillis()) {// This is what you should be worried about
				lastMessage = System.currentTimeMillis() + delay;
				System.out.println("Hello. This is a timed message that sends every " + this.delay + "ms.");
			}// This is what you should be worried about
		}//Ignore
	}

}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]<br>
Basically, your timer comes down to these small components:</p>
<p><code>	private long lastMessage;
	private long delay;
//
	if (lastMessage &lt; System.currentTimeMillis()) {
		lastMessage = System.currentTimeMillis() + delay;
	}</code></p>
<p>Every time the “lastMessage” variable is less than the value of the System’s current time in milliseconds, it executes the code in the if statement. For the timer to work properly, you must reset the “lastMessage” variable (In this example) to the System’s current time <span class="bbcode-b">PLUS</span> how long you want to wait.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> Server’s run on a 600 millisecond ‘tick’, so you will <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> be able to time it down to the last millisecond. You will have to do it based on ticks (1 tick = 600ms, 2 ticks = 1200ms, so on).</p>

This code in specific, no… It’s currently being used to refill your special bar.<br>
However, that is a timer… And a good example for you to read so you can see how it works in your server.<br>
For your timer, you need to basically do the same thing as seen above… but you will be using different methods, and a different way to check if the player needs to be modified (here it checks the players spec amount.  Your would check if they’re using dbowSpec).<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>O.K it’s just hard for me to understand what needs changed or what needs done, cause when i’m reading through java books they don’t exactly show you a private server being created or being fixed ect… that’s obv… i know. It’d just be nice to actually learn server coding instead of methods and class ect… with different examples being used… so it’s more understanding.[/quote]</p>

One could also explain in depth what a certain utility does in the given language followed by an irrelevant code snippet. It would display the same thing that you learn off of, explaining exactly what this element does, with unrelated code. Making you learn hands-on, ensuring you don’t lose what you’ve learned.<br>

<p>I’ve explained the parts he said he was stuck on, when he could give me an accurate post as to what he was stuck on…</p>
<p>And lets not forget the idea of the help section is that we’re helping push them into the right direction, not giving them the direct answer. He should also have some form of Java knowledge… Which (no offence tank) it is apparent he doesn’t based on the thread in it’s current state.</p>
<p>I can explain it to him 100 times, but I’ll be using Java (and computer) terminology, which I could presume he would not understand.<br>

<p>At this point, Tank, I think you need to read up on the Java documentation a bit more. You’re getting further into RSPS, which is entirely wrote in Java.<br>
For you to do anything effectively, you need to learn Java… Not use tutorials and snippets (Or spoonfed code) to get by, as you will run into a problem (guaranteed) that there is no tutorial for.</p>

Naming variables depends on what they’re for.</p>
<p>There’s very few real “restrictions” on variable names (Ex: can’t have it be a keyword like ‘int’, can’t have spaces or certain special characters, etc), but the literal name isn’t restriction.</p>
<p>You could call it “theLongThatIsForTheDarkBowSpecialTimer” if you wanted to.</p>
<p>But you <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> name it according to what it does. This makes it easier to read the code in the later…</p>
<p>[quote=“Wikipedia”]Some of the potential benefits that can be obtained by adopting a naming convention include the following:</p>
<p>to provide additional information (i.e., metadata) about the use to which an identifier is put;<br>
to help formalize expectations and promote consistency within a development team;<br>
to enable the use of automated refactoring or search and replace tools with minimal potential for error;<br>
to enhance clarity in cases of potential ambiguity;<br>
to enhance the aesthetic and professional appearance of work product (for example, by disallowing overly long names, comical or “cute” names, or abbreviations);<br>
to help avoid “naming collisions” that might occur when the work product of different organizations is combined (see also: namespaces);<br>
to provide meaningful data to be used in project handovers which require submission of program source code and all relevant documentation<br>
to provide better understanding in case of code reuse after a long interval of time.[/quote]<br>

<p>That would be why I just linked you to some of the basic guides.<br>
Here’s one on creating methods.<br>

<p>I know and understand this! i got 2 Java learning books from a public library where i live i read them it helped me understand things like the symbols and what a method is to what it does, like &amp;&amp; these are basically saying (and) || these lines are saying (or) ! this is meaning (not) ect… i learned a few things just don’t know how to write or what to put…</p>

<p>Writing the code is like 90% of the battle.</p>
<p>What exactly are you stuck on now?</p>
<p>Also, don’t say “I know and understand this” when you just said in the statement before:</p>

<p>I’m just trying to tell you i know everything else like that, but what class does this method even go in?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Okay, sorry, you confused me because it seemed like you were saying you already knew about methods.</p>
<p>I would say that the code needs to go like so:</p>
<p>The variable is declared in your Player class.</p>
<p>You’re probably going to want to declare a second one, a boolean, in there too (to know the player is using the specific special).</p>
<p>Now, you want to create a method for the special attack. Within this method it will do the following:<br>
Check the delay timer, make sure if you set the long to currentTime + delay, to set the value of the long to -1 after the second one has been shot. And also make sure to check the long is set to greater than 0 (default is 0) and less than current time. If you were doing it the opposite way (setting the long to just currentTime) you would need to check that the currentTime minus the long is greater than or equal to the delay. (Both ways need to check if the variable is &gt; 0 and set it to -1 when done).<br>
Check if the special is being used (Using the boolean you created).<br>
Send the gfx/arrow based on two conditions (Each condition for each time it sends):</p>
<ol>
<li>The dbow spec boolean is true, but the variable is &lt; 1 (The checks above need to take this into account) as the first time it sends it will be less than 1.</li>
<li>The dbow spec is true and the long is set to whichever way you used in the above check. When this arrow shoots, you set the bow spec to false and you set the long to -1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then within your activateSpecial method in your combat assistant, you want to turn the boolean for the spec above to true in the case (or if statement) for the dark bow.</p>
<p>You will have to edit the combatassistant next, and edit the attackplayer and attacknpc (naming may be wrong here) to account for the special. If the special is in use don’t let these methods send any other type of attack.<br>
In the same methods, would be where you use the method I described above.</p>
<p>I apologize if I worded that… confusingly.[/quote]</p>
<p>Okay another question my variable that i’ll be using in my method will be “projectile” right?</p>
