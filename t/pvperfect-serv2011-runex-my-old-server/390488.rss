    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pvperfect-serv2011-runex-my-old-server/390488</link>
    <description>Hey guys - it&#39;s me, Cows1471 (Or Chuck_Norris__ on r00nserba) and I&#39;m here to release my old delta source which i continuously needed to work on, but ran into problems because the process is too big and i couldn&#39;t replace it with anything -.-

The client.java is about 380kb, so it&#39;s been cleaned a bit. Loads of shit has been removed and i&#39;m not going to continue with it.

THE ATTACK IS 100% AWESOMENESS RECODED BY ME :jelly:

The antileech is in the range, and in the server.java. Enough hints.

Old as image ripped from my old account.

My old thread. This is heavily based from this.

[quote=&quot;cows1471, post:1, topic:337868&quot;][center][size=18pt]RuneX ~ By Bill[/size]
[size=12pt]
The Objective of RuneX is to bring together a new type of server. The server content will be very much based around how runescape was in 377 - 400. The only difference will be the economy!

So it is half correct when i say im making a &quot;RuneScape Remake&quot;. Difference: Economy and shop positions.

By Economy i mean shops, what players own and how much money they have. I aim to create a &quot;Perfect&quot; economy. The effect of a &quot;Perfect&quot; economy is being afraid to PK. I have played RuneScape since the 194 BETA and RSC

I am going to try and get EVERYTHING to do somthing. If that makes sence  :|

[b]Base: Deltacleaned
Why? 1 Reason. Yes, i could code on any base i would like, BUT on delta i can code fast. Very fast.[/b]
Lets begin:[/size]

Attack: 100% ~ Had allot of work on it by me and now is close to &quot;Perfect&quot;
Strength: 100% ~ Had allot of work on it by me and now is close to &quot;Perfect&quot;
Defence: 100% ~ Had allot of work on it by me and now is close to &quot;Perfect&quot;
The whole combat system has been rewritten by me to produce nice, clean combat. The max hit formulas are as close as can be and the battle timers are as close as possible. NPC&#39;s are using another &quot;perfect&quot; system. they NEVER flinch, but still need some work
Range: 100% ~ DONE :)
All projectiles, all requirements etc.
Prayer: 100% ~ Recoded and sexy!
Nothing much to say ~ Pretty perfect! Effects also added to the maxhit
Magic: 100% ~ Credits to Bakatool :D
Runecrafting: 50% ~ Started :D
Produces whats required, just need the hand held things...
HP: 100% ~ Ties in with rest...
Agility: 0% ~ No work yet
Herblore: 0% ~ No work yet
Thieving: 0% ~ No work yet
Crafting: 0% ~ No work yet
Fletching: 0% ~ No work yet
Slayer: 0% ~ No work yet
Mining: 95% ~ NEARLY!!!
Smithing: 0% ~ No work yet
Fishing: 100% ~ Only a bit left
Cooking: 40% ~ Needs work :/
Firemaking: 95% ~ Close to finishing.
Woodcutting: 70% ~ Needs more work
Farming: 0% ~ No work yet

Minigames:
Castle Wars: 90% ~ A bit more work needed
There will be more work ~ Just a bit more time needed :|
Evidence of work:

Me standing in varrock -,-
[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/2wc1wut.jpg[/img]

Me and a few mates chilling on the server
