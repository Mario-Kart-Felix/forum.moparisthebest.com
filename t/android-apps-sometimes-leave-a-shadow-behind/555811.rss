    <title>Android: App&#39;s sometimes leave a &quot;shadow&quot; behind</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/android-apps-sometimes-leave-a-shadow-behind/555811</link>
    <description>Hey, 

I have an android phone and it&#39;s running Android version 6.0. 
There&#39;s a been an issue I&#39;ve been having and I want to know if others have had this issue? 

Something apps would leave a &quot;shadow&quot; or watermark type print on my phone. E.g. I was once using chrome and the website (moparscape) + a few of chromes buttons like got imprinted on to my desktop wallpaper. When I switch users, it&#39;s fine the mark goes. If I change wallpapers the mark stays. I blamed Dr House (quietly) and factory reset my phone. 

I guess Dr House was not the blame because it happened again but this time with snapchat! I can see bits of the snapchat app on my background but this time it&#39;s like a mark on my camera. When I load my camera app, I can see a shadow of Snapchat in the background. It&#39;s not leaving a mark on my pictures though. Simple reboots do not fix this. When I screenshot, the shadow is not there either. 

Have you guys had this issue or heard of it? The phone I have is LG v10

Help meeee :(</description>

              <p>No, the reason this happened was not because it’s a cheap device. Sometimes if the screen gets damaged it becomes more prune to screen burn. Even if the digitiser is intact and there are no cracks etc.</p>
<p>But my trap line is better then the phone you linked.</p>

              <p>Okay so what I think it’s called is “screen burn”. The issue is suppose to only happen to AMOLED and OLED screens but my phone has IPS LCD. I tried a screen burn fix tool (which just flashes red, blue, green and white constantly) but that did not fix the issue <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Apparently it’ll fix by itself. So i’ll see what happens in 24 hours but wtf?</p>
<p>Edit: Does fix but a shadow of something else comes e.g. the spotify icon had a shadow left behind.</p>
