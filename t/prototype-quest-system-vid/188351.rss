    <description>[rant]There&#39;s so many private RSC-servers out there, they&#39;ve lost their flavour. Nothing is unique anymore and creativity is lost. It&#39;s all &#39;reach 99 99 99 in a week&#39; pk servers for lazy people whose excuse for persuading developers into making the game excruciatingly easy is &#39;they have a life&#39;, and so they can&#39;t train under more difficult conditions. And so when the training factor is removed, their &#39;busy lives&#39; become 24/7 pking with their easy stats. Next people will be asking for inbuilt autocatchers because they&#39;re too busy to pk properly. The sense of &#39;work for your rewards&#39; is gone, which was the key element in RSC, the game everyone here used to love. Whatever.[/rant]

Quests - the only unachieved gem in RSC server development, the only feature that truly implements diversity into a RSC server drowned in a sea of useless junk.

There&#39;s an example of my working prototype Quest system, fully scriptable and functional with database storing. It&#39;s about 60% done, and it didn&#39;t take long at all. It&#39;s time to mix this boring shit up a bit and create some real variety in this bland environment. I post this here as proof that things outside of the box are possible, and as an encouragement to fellow RSC server developers to quit copying eachother and do something [b]different[/b]. Quests are possible, they&#39;re not difficult to code if you know what you&#39;re doing, so where the hell are they?

Come on guys, do something new. We won&#39;t learn anything by copying eachother&#39;s poor-quality StorkPK rip-offs. Make your own games!

Good day.

Love,
punKrockeR.</description>

              <p>Hello, <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>When I first discovered Runescape Classic private servers, I have always wanted to play one that is as close to Runescape Classic as possible, because the reason I play Runescape Classic private servers is I’ve always wanted to play Runescape Classic, so for me the closer to the real thing the server is, the better!</p>
<p>As you can imagine, seeing this thread is great news to me, because adding quests to Runescape Classic servers is a big step forward to making something that is exactly the same as Runescape Classic!</p>
<p>Am I correct in thinking if you took RSCD and sorted out all the NPC’s (putting them in the right places and making them say the right things), added all the missing shops, added Theiving and Agility, and <span class="bbcode-i">then</span> added all the quests, you’d pretty much have a game that’s exactly the same as Runescape Classic?</p>
<p>I also think your idea of making brand new quests would be great!  As long as all the original Jagex quests are there too, I think it would be really great because if somebody doesn’t like any of the quests, they could make a suggestion if they’ve had an idea for a quest they would like to play.  Also, as somebody said, you could have quests that let you go to completely new areas!  So along with the whole original Runescape Classic map, if somebody made a server and they wanted to do this, they could enlarge the map with new places!</p>
<p>Thank you for doing this punKrockeR, I can’t wait to see if somebody is going to make a server with your quest system!</p>

              <p>[quote=“Stork, post:11, topic:188351”]I’m impressed. Finally, some real progress on an rsc server.<br>
So how did you do it? Mediator had some ideas with waypoints and such (can’t remember exactly how he wanted it done). If it’s scriptable and flexible, that’s good work.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks man. If I remember right, Mediator said something about having an int[] array in Player.java that stored the quest’s ‘stage’. If that’s correct, that’d mean the quests were probably also intended to be hard-coded into the server. Obviously I’m not going to post the source code to my quest system (at least not just yet) because last time all that seemed to encourage was lazy plagiarism, not acceleration of RSC server development like I was hoping. But I’ll explain it so that people who actually know how to code have some idea of how my system works - I’m sure there’s a billion alternative possible systems that would work just as well.</p>
<p>It’s probably not the most efficient method, but it’s the only method I could think of that truly allowed complete scriptability and control over quests. Basically, when the server starts, it loads the quest class files out of a folder called ‘quests’ (much like old RSC bots loading from the ‘scripts’ folder). A playable quest extends <span class="bbcode-b">Quest.class</span> (Methods.class with STS as a comparison - Quest holds all the quest-specific commands and the link to the Player owner and the server engine) It loads the <span class="bbcode-b">.class</span> files into memory (not the Quest objects due to the inability to correctly instantiate abstract classes that have been loaded directly, resulting in all quests having the same owner lol), and then when a player logs in, their QuestManager creates all the Quest objects with the player as the owner. Kind of hard to explain easily, but it works.</p>
<p>I’ll let the source code to the example TestScript explain the rest as much as possible.</p>

<p>Currently, triggerEntity() is handled by a synchronized Thread created inside the server engine itself, which is causing a number of odd side-effects, but there doesn’t appear to be any major bugs or exploits with the system so far.</p>
<p>The only thing the database saves is the quest’s current ‘stage’ (setStage(), getStage()) and the quest’s identifying UID and the user’s hash. This represents the player’s progression in the quest - whether they’ve just started it, they’ve already finished it or are up to the part where they collect the wool etc. All the database loading/saving is done automatically inside Quest.java when the stage value is modified or the quest is loaded.</p>
<p>QuestAction.class is just an enum with a list of action definitions, like MobState.class in Demonik. As you can see with triggerEntity(), any entity with an ID that has been defined as ‘associated’ with this quest will be redirected to that quest’s triggerEntity() method to be handled and controlled.</p>
<p>Basically, to add a new quest to the game, all that’s required is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The .class file in the quests folder.</li>
<li>The client-side quest name modifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>A brand new, unique quest will create its own database entry upon loading if necessary, so the quest creator doesn’t need to touch the database to implement new quests, nor do they have to touch the server or client’s source code (as quest names will be loaded externally client-side, and the quests assign themselves all the entity IDs they require to function in ‘define()’ so that you don’t have to touch the server code unless you’re tweaking the quest system itself).</p>
<p>My ideal purpose for quests is to add depth to the game instead of just ‘You require level 60 attack to wield this item’, not to create useless content to bore the players with. Most players hated RSC quests because 1) they’re lazy and 2) most of Jagex’s quests sucked. A good quest/story line makes the player actually want to complete it. Balls of wool is a bad example, but with a little imagination, you could come up with anything.</p>
<p>Obviously all these virtual objects could cause problems on a less-than-amazing server with 200 players all doing quests, but hey, it’s progress lolz.</p>

nah in my opinion the only reason pking was so much fun (and dont get me wrong, I loved rs-classic and pking) was because people had to train skills (fishing, mining, cooking, ect…) to get my for items. The pk servers make items worth practically nothing allowing people to get em from monster drops (guards and shit…) People felt proud to show up in the wild with a r2h or ruby ammys. Now I see those items all over the floor on Glowing Dagger and other pk based servers.</p>

              <p>Yeh not bad, but now someone is going to have to scrape up the old client and put the quest page in :P.</p>
<p>I didnt think quests would be too hard, but nobody liked quests (at least it seemed that way when it got brought up in rscd)</p>

<p>Rofl. Nice quest system, but any chance you’ve looked into what might be causing the memory leak? At 120ish users online the server can last for about 30 minutes without needing a restart.</p>
