Yeah well here is something ironic. If we havent found them… then what makes you think they would be able to find us? IDIOT!!! Think about it.<br>
I think there is other out there somewhere.[/quote]<br>
i smell dumbness…</p>
<p>other life forms may have such evolved technology that they are able to teleport and if you don’t know what teleporting means(wich i dont think you know cause you’re too dumb to even think about it)i’ll explain: teleporting means going from point A to B without anyone seeing you between the point A and B.<br>
Now we can’t find them 'cause they are too far away from us but they can reach us within (maybe) seconds with teleporting</p>
<p>Now i could say the same thing about you :<br>
“IDIOT!!! Think about it”</p>
