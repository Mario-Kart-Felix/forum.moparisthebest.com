    <description>When was the first time you did drugs? What was it? and how did you feel?

My first time was in gr.7. It was weed, and when i took in the huge breath my throat and  stomach burned like a son of a bitch and I ran to the tap.</description>

I’m confident that those who don’t get high their first time did not inhale correctly. I got high my first time, and 2 other people that tried it with me for their first time got high (I made sure they inhaled correctly). However, it took ~15 minutes to take affect my and their first times.</p>

<p>My first time few times I did not get baked at all. I might have been inhaling the wrong way. This is common. My first time getting truly baked, I was very suprised how good it felt. Next thing I know, I bought a shitload of munchies at the store, and then we were walking home and it felt like I was being sucked into the ground and stuff. I wish I could get those effects still, lol.</p>

i cant believe that all these people who say there first time at weed was ok but they just had the munchies… So no one pulled a whitey? no one was sick? find that hard to believe<br>

<p>i cant believe that all these people who say there first time at weed was ok but they just had the munchies… So no one pulled a whitey? no one was sick? find that hard to believe</p>

<p>The first time I had a spliff I felt a little “light headed”, and almost light footed, and been fine since. The first time I tried a “bong”, (not a full bong a little shitty small bottle) I felt sick but I knew I wasn’t going to be sick and I wasn’t, although my mates thought differently and kept their distance. Funnily enough, I can’t smoke cigs normally without choking half to death, however even with less than 3:1 in tobaccos favour to weed, I can smoke it fine. Saying that though, I’m a non smoker so I really do doubt anyone who has tried weed that didn’t do it in a spliff first time would have troubles, but I always toked my spliffs slowly.</p>
