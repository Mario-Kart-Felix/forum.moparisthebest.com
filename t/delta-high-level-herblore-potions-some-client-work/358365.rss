    <title>[Delta] High-Level Herblore Potions [Some Client Work]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-high-level-herblore-potions-some-client-work/358365</link>
    <description>This does include some client-sided work, but it&#39;s just recolors, so I figured it was okay to add them to this tutorial, since most of the work was server-sided.

[b]NOTE: This tutorial will replace the following potions...
Attack Potion
Defense Potion
Restore Potion
Fishing Potion
Superantipoision
Zamorak Potion
Antifire Potion[/b]


Open up class8.java, and add this in with your custom items.

http://pastebin.com/SfqivHxa
(I had to use pastebin, because with all the code in the entire post added together, the post was over 30,000 characters long).



If you don&#39;t use a switch for your custom items, then add this in instead.

http://pastebin.com/iSFBqSd4

Compile your client and reload it.



[Server Sided]
Open up potions.java, and add this in.

http://pastebin.com/Mn4ccakB



OPTIONAL:
For the overload potion damage effect, Do the following...

In client.java, declare these variables:
[code]public int overloadcount = 0;
public long overloadtimer = 0;[/code]

Add these lines to the four overload potion codes in potions.java:
[code]c.overloadtimer = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000;
c.overloadcount = 5;[/code]

Add this to your process() (or equivalent) method in client.java:
[code]if(overloadtimer &lt;= System.currentTimeMillis() &amp;&amp; overloadtimer != 0){
if(overloadcount &gt; 0){
overloadhit();
}
if(overloadcount &gt; 1){
overloadcount -= 1;
overloadtimer = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000;
} else if(overloadcount == 1){
overloadcount = 0;
overloadtimer = 0;
}
}[/code]


Explaining the bits and pieces...

[code]c.specialAmount += 25;
if(c.specialAmount &gt; 100){
c.specialAmount = 100;
c.sM(&quot;Your special attack energy is full!&quot;);
}[/code]
Increases your special attack energy by 25%.
After you drink the potion, the server resets the energy back to 100 if it went over that amount.

[code]c.setAnimation(829);[/code]
The eating animation. No shit.

[code]				if(c.currentHealth &lt;= 0) {
				break;
				}[/code]
Prevents you from eating if you died.
[code]
c.deleteItem(####, slot, 1);
c.addItem(####, 1);[/code]
Replaces the consumed potion with the next lowest dose.

[code]if (System.currentTimeMillis() -c.potionDelay &lt; 2000)
return;[/code]
Does not let you consume the potion if you have consumed one in the last 2 seconds.

[code]c.playerLevel[#] = c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[#]);
c.playerLevel[#] += 26;[/code]
Sets the boosted level to its normal amount before boosting it to prevent the user from boosting multiple times.

[code]
c.overloadtimer = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000;
c.overloadcount = 5;[/code]
Sets the amount of hits it deals to 5, and makes it happen in 1 second (1000 milliseconds)

[code]if(overloadtimer &lt;= System.currentTimeMillis() &amp;&amp; overloadtimer != 0){
if(overloadcount &gt; 0){
overloadhit();
}
if(overloadcount &gt; 1){
overloadcount -= 1;
overloadtimer = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000;
} else if(overloadcount == 1){
overloadcount = 0;
overloadtimer = 0;
}
}[/code]
If the overloadtimer is 0, then you have not drank an overload potion.
If it is not 0, but it&#39;s still less than the current system time, then it knows that a second has passed, and deals another hit.
If the overload count is more than 0, then it deals a hit.
If it is more than 1, then it resets the counter and timer, so that&#39;s the last hit that is dealt.


Enjoy.
Comments, Issues, whatever.
Just reply.

If you don&#39;t want to replace any of the potions mentioned in the beginning of the tutorial, do not ask me to change all the ID&#39;s. You can do that yourself.
Don&#39;t leech, unless your converting it to work on Packaged servers.</description>
