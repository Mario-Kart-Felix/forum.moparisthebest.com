        <p>Since I joined this community, it’s gotten a lot better. Why is it that every time I see it starting to peek to a point where it seems like everything is getting so much better, someone has to complain about how terrible it is. Half of the reason why “This community fails” is because no one looks forward to it’s future. If it’s so terrible, why don’t doesn’t everyone that rants about it try a little bit harder and contribute to the community rather than complaining. We’ve already established that a majority of the members here are immature, but by complaining about it you’re only making yourself look as low as them. I’ve tried to explain in a few threads my opinion on this subject, but no one even takes notice to it. Imo, I don’t see how anyone else can understand each other on the same level when they all want to get their own opinion across. Our problem is being selfish; everyone here wants to make some sort of name for themselves.</p>

        <p>Well the answer to that question is very simple, A large proportion of people are ignorant and dont even look at a single word in the rules. (these members often have little computer knowledge and expect to be spoonfed their way to the top). If you think its getting worse, thats because “some” staff have given up on constantly having to pester people just to make the site look ‘ok’. Last but not least, the main reason that this site is messed up is that <a href="http://www.google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a> is not apprarent to several members. If every member made the effort to use google and learn java <span class="bbcode-b">before</span> moaning like a two year old the community would become a much more informative place.</p>

First of all, I dont know if this is really server help.<br>
I dont really care <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Second. Welcome to the internet :D! Jerks are gonna be jerks, its the way of the world. No matter what you do, theres still gonna be some egotistical jerk, or some annoying idiot out there to make things seem messed up.</p>
<p>So you know what I would do? Shut em up :P. I am absolutely SURE that every single successful server owner out there have dealed with at least 100 morons or jerks. But the world keeps on spinning, and everyone learns someday (usually :P).</p>
<p>By the way, Im 12 <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> I dont know if you can tell by sucky spelling or grammer but im in 6th grade, and Ive seen plenty of 16 year morons. You would think have “senority” over lower grades would make you more mature. Well something about senority that makes people think they have the right to be a jackass to youger kids.</p>
<p>Of course im not stereotyping, Because im not sure how im gonna be when im 16 <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> I have 2 older brothers, one 19 and one 17 and there friends arent exactly “mature” most of mine arent either. Well sorry to keep rambling on, I hope ive proved some point <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>[/quote]A 12 year old thats more mature than a lot of 13-17 year olds on here? Doesn’t surprise me one bit.[/quote]</p>
<p>I wouldn’t call that maturity either. He will end up the same way as his brothers no matter how much he tries to resist. He may be become more mature underneath, but he will still seem immature on the outside. That’s how all of us are.</p>

<p>Everyone is ignorant of something. For example, you are being ignorant of the fact that not everyone here is as ignorant and stupid as you portray them to be. And I also doubt that you yourself made an effort to use google and learn Java before coming here yourself, so why are you giving this piece of advice to others?</p>

        <blockquote>I wouldn't call that maturity either. He will end up the same way as his brothers no matter how much he tries to resist. He may be become more mature underneath, but he will still seem immature on the outside. That's how all of us are.</blockquote>
<p>Well that’s a little bit depressing. I understand, my 19 year old brother is actually really mature, always has been. Kinda a weird thing about him.<br>
Anyway, I know it already says it in the rules to “use Google first” and “NO SPOONFEEDING” I don’t understand why people don’t get penalized for it. I think we need to get even stricter in order to get people to calm down and think.</p>
<p>And now thinking even further, how many private servers are REALLY successful? I understand there’s a million people looking to start a server. I think a forum like this is great, but we gotta get past just the “port forwarding stage” eventually right? Now Ive seen some pretty awesome guides and tuts that are great for the server but too many that say “how to add dialogue” and “how to make yourself admin”. Now I am a little bit stubborn, so I usually try to do everything myself. I didn’t come across moparscape till awhile after my server was up. So I learned the hard way how to port forward and make a web client and more and more. But at least now I know mostly what Im doing. Now i have loyal donators, a good webclient some nice players, a forum admin, mods, and I’m about to pay for a brand new VPS. Of course I used Google as help. But what I don’t understand is why people come here first, instead of Google. Google will come up with what moparscape has, and so much more :D.</p>
<p>My point is is that the forum maybe could become a little more advanced. Im not sure how much more we can do about it, but we gotta get people to just try.</p>

<p>I agree, the success of a server is usually directly related to the amount of content that is in it. But the performance is a large factor, which is why Mopar has the entire Sponsored Servers thing going on now.</p>
<p>And about improving the website, if you get any ideas, make sure you post them in the suggestions sticky right away. I personally look forward to seeing all the ideas that people come up with.</p>
