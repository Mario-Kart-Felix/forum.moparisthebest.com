    <title>Players in view</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/players-in-view/463463</link>
    <description>I am curious to know how many players any of you have successfully managed to show in the view of one player (on the client-side), without any bugs or other problems occurring.

I know the client can show 500 players in its view at any given time. Have anyone actually managed to do that?

If you do get problems at any number of players, what problems do you get?

If you wounder why I ask this. I do get problems when showing 256 players in my own view (including myself), but not 255 players. I have a theory to what can cause this, but before any conclusions can be made, I need input on this from the whole community. It may after all be a problem on my end. But it may also be something other people have noticed (I don&#39;t know).

Note: This isn&#39;t a question asking for help in the normal sense, as I&#39;m not asking for a solution to this problem. So therefore I put it in this section rather than the help section.</description>

              <p>I was thinking perhaps the algorithm being used to write bits would be the cause. But I’m not so sure.</p>
<p>It works fine if I use the last part of the player position update (that is, the part that adds new players to the client, or that updates already known players whose positions have changed more than one step in any given direction). Although, by doing so, I will also increase the load on the server-side and client-side a lot. The part that updates already known players that are either removed, have walked one step in any given direction, have only changed their direction or have done nothing, should be used.</p>
<p>The algorithm for writing bits is pretty much the same as in all other servers, that I know. The algorithms for encoding and decoding messages are not the same as in, for instance, RSCA, as they will not work correctly with the original RSC client. The same thing is true for player position updates (and npc position updates). No indices are used in the part where you update already known players (or npcs).</p>
<p>What actually happens when I write the index of players in the last part of the player position update (and I also have the update existing players part just above that one), is that a lot of the indices will be read incorrectly (sometimes when read, they are above 1000, even if there are only 300 players). If I check their index before being written to bits, they do have correct values.</p>
<p>Lothy: The limitation client-side for player in ones view is 500 and there is an array for players that has a length of 4000. I think the array with a length of 4000 is used in conjunction with the last part of the player position update, that is, when adding new players that havn’t been added to the client before. Players that have been added to the client before, but are part of this last part, are not added to that array.</p>

              <p>There shouldn’t be much to it. Maybe the size of the players array client side, maybe a limitation on the number of players in an update packet. Beyond that though, nothing comes to mind.</p>

<p>If you can show 255 but not 256 then that means that only a byte is being used to represent the total number of players being sent in the update packet – 255 is the maximum value of an unsigned byte.</p>

<p>im sure he knew that! theres gotta be something more</p>

<p>I noticed some RSCD-based servers (probably RSCDaemon and onwards), had their player and npc position updates changed from that in the original RSC client.

The source I was using in that video was DarkQuest, so yeah it’s based on RSCA. As for the client… I can’t say much about it… I haven’t really looked into a non-rscd client in depth before.</p>

<p>RSCA had 700+ players in 1 area (about 12x12) and it ran fine. but after you start reaching that much data being sent from client&lt;&gt;server you can come across all sorts of issues if you don’t handle packet fragmentation properly.</p>
