    <description>For all of those who need help with No-ip hosting!....

I am not really big to this but i can host no-ip so....

First of all you need to download a server to host! click [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html]Here[/url]
And find any server that you find suitable for you! Now that we have downloaded a server, we can open up our folder to get the server working right click the compiler and change it to:
[code]@echo off
title rapeScape Compiler
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_10\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp . *.java
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_10\bin\java.exe&quot; server
pause[/code]
note:[i]Change the java to what yours is...[/i]

Now open up your &quot;run server.bat and change it to:
[code]@echo off
title p00nscape Server
java -Xmx1024m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-ga-bin.jar server[/code]

note:[i]Change the java to what yours is...[/i]

I do not use my compiler or my runserver i use a runserver&amp;compiler:

[code]@echo off
COLOR 0c
title Narbscape Compile + Run
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin\javac&quot; -cp . *.java
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin\java&quot; server
pause 
[/code]

Now that our compilers are working your server is ready for updating but now to do no-ip, First of all we need a domain, you can pay or you can get one for free, go to www.no-ip.com and register, now that we have registered we can login and go to &quot;manage&quot; on the left hand side of our screen and click &quot;add a host&quot; now we can pick a server name and what ip we want! if an ip is already taken then don&#39;t moan lol.
Now go to downloads and download no-ip DUC and then it will update your no-ip host so you can host it!

We have a perfect server, a perfect no-ip host, BUT WAIT now we need no-ip to work, go to your start panel and right click &quot;my computer&quot;  and click &quot;properties&quot; Now at the top you will see loads of tabs, click &quot;advanced&quot; Then at the bottem of this tab you will see &quot;enviroment variables&quot; click this.

Now on the first box click &quot;new&quot; and add this for the variable name use &quot;[code]CLASSPATH[/code]&quot; and for the variable value use &quot;[code]Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;%CLASSPATH%;.[/code] &quot; now that box is done we need to do the other box! they are not the same but the variables are, for the name click &quot;CLASSPATH&quot; for the value click
&quot;[code].;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_09\lib\ext\QTJava.zip[/code]&quot; now put your server on, And if it doesn&#39;t work then your computer is a cookie head.

If that doesnt work use this one:</p>
<p><code>
@echo off

title [Your title here]
c:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_13\bin\javac" -cp . *.java
echo Succesfully Compiled!
pause</code> And IF That Doesnt Work You Probably Downloaded The Wrong Java Like Me Make Sure You Typed FULL Version Of Java Not A Crappy One, You Can Also Try Uninstalling And Re-Installing Java.</p>

<pre><code>  When I decided to come back to private servers, I got all the files I needed but couldnt find the code I needed for the compiler. Thanks to you.. I have it! So many people tried to solve my problem with.. "Go download java" Well, isnt that a good idea you noobs. Anyway, thanks a bunch, couldnt get my compiler to work. Didnt read the rest of the post, just got the code I needed. I'm sure its very helpful.
