(sorry no link)

[quote]WEST KENDALL, Fla. - Officials locked down a Florida elementary school after two people reportedly fired shots at each other and fled the scene, WTVJ-TV reported Thursday.

The two suspects were on school grounds when the shooting took place, authorities told the NBC News affiliate.

Police closed off roads in the area as they look for the suspects.

Shots were heard shortly before 11 a.m. near Christina M. Eve Elementary School, said John Schuster, a school district spokesman for Miami Dade County Public Schools. 

Schuster said there was no indication the suspects were students and initially said the shooting did not occur on school grounds. The reason for differing information could not be immediately be determined.

Two men, maybe more, were reportedly in a car in front of the school, and police were reportedly looking for the vehicle.

There were no immediate reports of injuries.</description>
