    <title>Linux server hosting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/linux-server-hosting/334756</link>
    <description>I recently changed my windows laptop to Linux (Ubuntu YAY!) and I wish to run my server on it. I followed the tutorial by Fat Cookies (I think?) and it all went well until I had to run the server. I made run.sh (the shell version of my run.bat file) and I tried putting   chmod -x run  into terminal but it says it cannot find the file or directory.

Any help is appreciated, maybe even repped if I think that it is deserved
