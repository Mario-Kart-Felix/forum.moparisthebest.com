    <description>Recently Sony Pictures was the victim of a massive network attack. Massive amounts of intellectual property and business secrets were stolen and dumped online. The attack was claimed by the &quot;GOP&quot; - Guardians of Peace.

I have put together a small presentation, including an overview of the data that was dumped and some technical analysis of the attack vectors:
