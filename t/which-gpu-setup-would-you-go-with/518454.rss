    <title>Which GPU setup would you go with?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-gpu-setup-would-you-go-with/518454</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to build a new computer soon, but I&#39;m debating on the two following GPU options:

1) NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 690 4GB GDDR5
OR
2) Dual (SLI) NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 680 2GB GDDR5

Which one would you rather prefer/think would perform the best?</description>

              <p>SLI will always be better for higher resolution, higher texture games no matter how you chalk it up. Go for the SLI setup if you’re going to be gaming on high resolutions (1920x1080 or more) or if you want to run some custom high textures for games. If you likely won’t be doing either of those things, a single card will use much less power, there will be less heat, it’s usually cheaper and upgrading won’t be too much of a hassle.</p>

I’m going to build a new computer soon, but I’m debating on the two following GPU options:</p>
<ol>
<li>NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 690 4GB GDDR5<br>
OR</li>
<li>Dual (SLI) NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 680 2GB GDDR5</li>
</ol>
<p>Which one would you rather prefer/think would perform the best?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Dual GTX 680 would WAAAY out-preform the single 690[/quote]<br>
Hardly, plus it takes up a lot more room, electric bill++, bad sli drivers etc.</p>
<p>See benchmarks: <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/gtx690-vs-gtx680-sli-review">http://www.squidoo.com/gtx690-vs-gtx680-sli-review</a></p>
<p>I have the GTX 680 at the moment, but if I were to pick again I’d pick up the 690 instead of another 680</p>
