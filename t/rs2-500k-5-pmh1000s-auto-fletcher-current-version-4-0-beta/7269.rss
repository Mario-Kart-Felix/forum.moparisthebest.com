                  21) Removed A Few Out Of Date/Useless Procedure and functions
                  22) Adjusted The Running Procedure
  Version 3.3 For This Update i had to fix a few var errors caused by the new srl, 3.81
                this is now fixed and thus the script will compile again. i also had
                to redo the stringing procedure because rs FINALLY decided to put in
                a make-x into stringing, everyone knows that alot of peeps fletch
                and have needed it for a long time. well anywayz i fixed the stringing
                procedure and made a few changes to some other things in order to make
                the script run a little smoother. i hope everyone enjoys to update!  
  Version 3.2 Basically I have made a lot of chanegs based on the New srl (3.7) And
                the new scar, Scar Divi 3.06, Everything is now fully functional and
                i have made several bug fixes and modified a few procedures as well
                as speeding up the fletching and stringing some. thanks for everyones
                patience, i have been so busy and im sorry it took me so long to release
                it :\ but its here now! 3.2  
  Version 3.1 Improved the stringing by making it faster and run smoother. Improved
                the  Bank Detection by correcting a timing error for the procedure
                bankerror; thus enabling the fail safe with the setting in the form
                Made the banking open smoother. Improved the timing on the wait during
                fletching by tweaking my technique. This allows for better detection on
                laggy comps as well. Added compass direction for logging in and when
                script takes a break. Corrected a bug with locating the bank, a fail safe
                Added a detection to my GoToScreen procedure, where it clicks on rs screen
                if form didnt minimize, now will detect if it needs to do this.
  Version 3.0 This was a huge update that added DetectFrogCave, a new banking
                procedure that i wrote, OneClickBank. I also removed some procedures
                due to them no longer being used, CloseBank2 LoginPlayer2 &amp; LogOutEvery2.
                I reorginized all of the procedure into five categories, Misc Bank Fletching
                Stringing &amp; Forms. Made a list of every procedure that i wrote in my script
                and i gave the line number where they were found. It is still left as OpenSource
                so that you can learn from my script
  Version 2.5 Made A few Changes With SRL V3.4 And Fixed The Banking Errors :P
  Version 2.4 Added A BankType Which Allows You To Pick Between 5 Different Banking
                Procedures, As Well As OpenBankQuiet And The Area Your At :)
  Version 2.3 Added A LogType To The Form And Now You Can Even Cut Shafts And Reg Bows :)
  Version 2.2 Changed The Script To Accommidate The CrossBow Stock Option
  Version 2.1 Added Forms To The Script :P Thanxs To Starblaster, MadCow &amp; Bego
  Version 2.0 Changed The Whole Script Using New Techniques To Make The Script Much
                Better Then What It Once Was Including Antiban, Randoms And Using SRL
  Version 1.5 Rewrote My Randoms Procedure As Well As The Banking And Antiban Features
  Version 1.4 Scripted It With The New Squig2 And Added A Few More Antiban Features
  Version 1.3 Added The Ability To Choose Whether You Fletch Or Whether You String.
  Version 1.2 Added The Ability To Also String Bows After Your Done Fletching
  Version 1.1 Put In A Working Progress Report For Both Fletching And Stringing

              <p>just to give everyone an update. i have been 95% done with v4.0 twice now and due to a hard drive crash the first time i lost all 18 hours worth of work. i was pissed but yesterday i decided to sit down and do it all ove again from the start of version 3.3.  However, somehow i got a trojan that was giving my popups from hell and not allowing me to go to any websites. i fought it for about 30 min and uploaded the only copy of 4.0 that i had. i attached it and emailed it to my self. i was happy that i was able to save it before i wiped the hard drive and started over again.thats been the second wipe in a week. anyhow after the wipe i went to pull it from my email and finish it. i had put around 8 hours of nonstop work into it this time. and when i downloaded it, it was like i had done nothing…  somehow it was reverted back to 3.3  so naturally im pissed as hell and i swear im going to try one more time and if something happens im going to take a two-three week break because ive put alot into it two time and lost it both time.  26 hours of straight work with a lot of improvements and making it a lot better was lost. so anyways im going to start on it now and if all goes well ill have it soon. thanks for your patience and understanding. your support is the reason that i am still working on it. without it i would have given up already. and to all that want to purchase it i just want to let you know that first i want to have 4.0 released because due to a updated srl / rs interface 3.3 doesnt currently work. I hope you understand. i just dont want to sell you a broken copy, even though the new one should be out soon.</p>
<p>P.S.  Please remember to email me with suggestions and ideas on what i could do to make the script even better, or if you find a bug. send the email to,    <a href="mailto:pmh1000@hotmail.com">pmh1000@hotmail.com</a>    and for the subject either put ‘Fletcher V(Version number) Bug’      Or      ‘Suggestion For Fletcher’</p>
<p>Thanks So Much</p>
