    <title>Something new, please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/something-new-please/367900</link>
    <description>EDIT: Getting some proof of ability at this very moment.

As we are all aware, there is a veritable plethora of poorly woven servers. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are many who have positively contributed, but often these contributions go to waste, as they are (in terms of snippets and tutorials) crammed into otherwise badly crafted servers, which, in turn are washed away in a sea of the same.

This is what makes those who know what they&#39;re doing so much more special.

And this is why I was thinking- why not gather the greatest minds of RSPS development, and provide for them a haven, where collaboration is unfettered by the endless waves of noobs, and new and exciting systems may be born?

Ultimately, I am hoping that borne on the success of the venture, there will be a renewed vigour in the development of quality RS private server mechanisms, (excuse any erroneous terminology) and hopefully, a true, new era.

At this moment, there&#39;s no [i]public[/i] site for this... collective, if you will. If any interest is expressed, I will continue its development and get something started.

[b]Some notes so you don&#39;t flame me. Well, please don&#39;t anyway. Actually, I will get flamed anyway, because I can&#39;t reach you.[/b]

[ul][li]I understand that these people will not always be willing to just hand out the code.[/li]
[li]I know that this is probably stupid, but I&#39;m bored and thought that it may be a good idea.[/li]
[li]I am aware of the billion reasons why it probably won&#39;t work.[/li]
[li]I used some tricky words and got criticised for it, sweet. 
[/li][li]I hope you enjoy my &#39;optimism&#39; ;D[/li][/ul]</description>

I will enable an application system soon; if I were to implement a forum based one such as most of the others have, they would be available for the rest of the community to see, and we know how it’s awkward both touting yourself around in front of everyone, and when everyone disagrees (as stated by EmulousGuru)- therefore I’m going to make a more private one.<br>

You’re going to make a more private application, so people classify themselves as elitists, and you determine who joins, and who doesn’t?</p>

<p>If you want an ‘amazing server’ to prevail, then start learning about programming, not just Java.<br>
Take some C# classes, or Netty/Mina classes to learn about the networking.</p>
