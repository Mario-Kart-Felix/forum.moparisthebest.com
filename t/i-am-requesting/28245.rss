    <title>I am requesting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-am-requesting/28245</link>
    <description>I would like to request an &quot;Auto-(type of rune)Maker&quot;
It would probabily take forever to make, and I don&#39;t know if anyone has made one before(because I didn&#39;t look).
But if anyone would like to give it a shot, go ahead, my past attempts have failed for some reason.
And, since I&#39;m loseing members soon, maybe an &quot;AutoFisher/Banker&quot; from Karamja..Just cuz I&#39;m lazy to work on the walking.</description>
