    <title>HP bar and chat doesn&#39;t show above head</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hp-bar-and-chat-doesnt-show-above-head/257503</link>
    <description>Well, I have a problem. The HP and chat does NOT show if the player is IN COMBAT with an npc or another player. It is invisible. I get this when I use silab or mopar client, but not a client such as RichScape. I am using PvP Palace for my new server base. Is there anyway to have the HP visable using the moparscape or silab client?

I can&#39;t really supply any code as I have no idea what loads the HP bar or chat; except the chat packet. But if anyone has had this problem or does know how to fix it...it would be greatly appreciated!</description>
