    <title>New Server - Need a Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-server-need-a-team/545912</link>
    <description>Hi,

I am looking to start a server up and am looking for a team to help me out.

Basically, I have a website/name already come up with. It is a .com website too. I&#39;m looking for active and motivated people to help me out on this. I am active a lot throughout the day and also have Skype on my phone to communicate with.

What I can offer:
A .com website with a name already picked out
A little coding experience
Activity and Motivation towards the project


What am I looking for in a Team:
Motivation and Activity
Creativity
Professional Attitude



If you&#39;d like to talk about joining my team, add me on skype - Garrett3650</description>
