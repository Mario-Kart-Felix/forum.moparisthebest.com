    <title>Welcome to Dimmu!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/welcome-to-dimmu/136924</link>
    <description>Well, I have had many **** servers, as meaning, hardly anything SEMI DECENT in it at all.

How I got into PServs:
Well one day I was browsing [url=http://www.sythe.org]www.sythe.org[/url], and I came across these &quot;private servers&quot;. I asked one person how to use them, and he told me I had to be really good at SCAR lmao, and I believed him. So a few months later I came across [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf]www.moparisthebest.com/smf[/url], and registered. From then on I started to code. I slowly learned, and put out two servers that made it, and averaged 20 people on every hour or so. But this story is horrible, so here comes the updates.
Now a little slideshow:

[url=http://img228.imageshack.us/slideshow/player.php?id=img228/6698/11875963573xz.smil]Slideshow of Masked Items![/url]

Goal:
Rent a DEDICATED SERVER!
I will accept donations ranging from 100K-1M, or how much you want to. I only accept RSGP, because I can make a lot more than what I&#39;d be sent by selling it to RL friends. I don&#39;t have a Paypal, and I don&#39;t want random amounts of cash being sent to me in the mail, because my parents would be pissed. So if you want to donate, I&#39;ll need $105 I believe for the first month. {About 20M for the first month. I can get about $5-$6 per mil from my friends, because they have jobs, and are 2-3 years older than me. Keep in mind, I&#39;m only 14, and my parents don&#39;t want random people sending me money in the mail..}

              <p>Aww, that’d be really kind of you to donate. I don’t care if it ranges from only 100K to whatever you want. All donations above 100K help a lot. I need to update it a bit more.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
About 3 new updates guys. I’m removing Item Masking so Magic has a point. I will post pictures soon, I need to start adding portals back in… :S</p>

Shut up Steviie. I need donations if you want it be up 24/7 with NO LAG. I only accept RUNESCAPE because I sell mils/items to my friends IRL. I don’t have Paypal because my dad is to lazy to talk to the bank about it. My parents are also strict about the fact of people sending me small/large amounts of cash, and especially about people they don’t know. If you think I’m doing this to get “fr33 itemz plz”, you can just leave my thread. If my parents were less strict, I’d accept cash by mail, but they’re just like that.<br>

<p>You mean leave your topic. Anyway, alot of people say this, in the end they end up getting scammed. I ‘DONATED’ a whip with torag legs. In the end, 2 days later, I was banned and he made about 20+ mill by ‘DONATIONS’ rofl.[/quote]<br>
Steviie, stfu.<br>
Stop looking at others but look at yourself.<br>
Your acting like a monkey.</p>

I have 1 Mod AT THE MOMENT, but I can’t remember his name. I believe it’s just Reaper, on a site I go to that Harvey owns. But I won’t go to far into detail about it. Keep the posts coming! I want to have a 2:10 ratio of posts to views. The more you post, the more I update.</p>

              <p>Well, I have had many **** servers, as meaning, hardly anything SEMI DECENT in it at all.</p>
<p>How I got into PServs:<br>
Well one day I was browsing <a href="http://www.sythe.org" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">www.sythe.org</a>, and I came across these “private servers”. I asked one person how to use them, and he told me I had to be really good at SCAR lmao, and I believed him. So a few months later I came across <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com/smf</a>, and registered. From then on I started to code. I slowly learned, and put out two servers that made it, and averaged 20 people on every hour or so. But this story is horrible, so here comes the updates.<br>
Now a little slideshow:</p>
<p><a href="http://img228.imageshack.us/slideshow/player.php?id=img228/6698/11875963573xz.smil" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Slideshow of Masked Items!</a></p>
<p>Goal:<br>
Rent a DEDICATED SERVER!<br>
I will accept donations ranging from 100K-1M, or how much you want to. I only accept RSGP, because I can make a lot more than what I’d be sent by selling it to RL friends. I don’t have a Paypal, and I don’t want random amounts of cash being sent to me in the mail, because my parents would be pissed. So if you want to donate, I’ll need $105 I believe for the first month. {About 20M for the first month. I can get about $5-$6 per mil from my friends, because they have jobs, and are 2-3 years older than me. Keep in mind, I’m only 14, and my parents don’t want random people sending me money in the mail…}</p>
