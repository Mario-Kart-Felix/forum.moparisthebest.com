    <description>Ok hello there guys this is my first post  :cool:
Let me begin by saying that this is NOT going to be a newb spoonfeeding topic, as I am an experienced coder and do not need help grasping code.

I have been interested in runescape ever since I was a kid and was always facinated by moparscape as well, but it seems like the concepts which seem basic to most just seem to escape my grasp. I would love to be involved with development, but it seems like the only two sides of tutorials are incredibly basic noob sh*t, such as port forwarding, etc, or stuff that is made for more experienced moparscape devs. I am looking to get started with making a server, but there are a lot of things which i cannot find answers too which may seem simple, so bear with me please.

1) I know nothing of runescape/moparscape src structure, etc; Are there any generic tuts on what does what? like for example, where do models/music compile too- are they external internal, etc. anything like this is simply not spoken of.

2) Is there ANY kind of mainline source tarball? I have no idea what on god&#39;s green earth &quot;Hyperion&quot; or &quot;Project Insanity&quot; are, but I assume that they are some kind of revision of the main source. Where are descriptions of all of them, or even a list of all the ones that exist? even still, what ARE they? are they versions of the same code? are they by different authors? are they even the same game??

3) Is there any database of source/binary packages? is there a central location of all the projects?

I seriously dont know jack squat about this software as you can tell, but I am no noob- I need a concise, to the point tutorial that isnt afraid to break into the java. Hopefully I can find some answers here. Please help  :(</description>

<p>thanks that clears a LOT of stuff up. I see many servers now in the forums, these are all open source correct? a buddy of mine says that they contain a lot of proprietary code, this is true for only the game data files and not the individual server packages right?</p>

              <p>There’s a search bar with windows and most IDE’s have a search. If you’re looking for something such as music search “music”.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how you get confused by the source though since its all layed out like <code>minigames/pestcontrol.java</code> or <code>npc/kbd.java</code>  etc.</p>
<p>More or less client sided everything is packed within the cache (well should be) such as sprites, animations etc.</p>
<p>Hyperion/Project-Insanity are all names given by the creators of that source I.E creating the server from scratch (assuming you know how since you did say “I am an experienced coder”) and naming the project w.e.</p>
<p>The central location for these servers are the download section. There is also a tutorial section for you too check out which contains  loads of stuff.</p>
