1: Ok first problem....My max stats are 200 right but when i log into game they 200/99. I want the stat to read 200/200 for all players. How may I fix that?
2: Ok next problem....My hp is supposed to be 200/99 but i did master command right.....well then when i logged in cause u have too once you do master command. OK well when i logged in everything else was 200/99 but hp was 1/99. Then when i ate food the highest my hp would go to was 70/99. How may i fix that?

Well thats about it atm. If you could help with these problems that would be great.
