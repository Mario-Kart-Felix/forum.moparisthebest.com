    <title>Moparscape wont open (mac)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-wont-open-mac/47864</link>
    <description>I&#39;m really hoping you can help me with this.

I downloaded the mac version, and I try to open the MoparScape.jar, and I get a message saying:

[center]&quot;[b]Jar Launcher[/b][/center]

The jar file &#39;MoparScape.jar&#39; could not be launched.  Check the Console for possible error messages&quot;

I dont know what this means.  I opened Console, and didn&#39;t see anything.  I also tried going to the &quot;open&quot; option in Console.  All it did, was let me see the coding, or whatever it is that makes up the program.  (Btw, there is no &#39;run&#39; option in console.  All it seems to do is let you see what makes up the program) Can someone please tell me how to get MoparScape to open?  I am really anxious to play, but cant due to this...
Thanks for the help.

Note: This is on a mac.  I read the FAQ, and dont really know what to do on a mac.  It only has things for a pc.

Thanks for any help on the matter.</description>
