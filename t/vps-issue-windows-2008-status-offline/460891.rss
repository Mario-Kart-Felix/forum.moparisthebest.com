    <title>VPS Issue (windows 2008, status: offline)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vps-issue-windows-2008-status-offline/460891</link>
    <description>I am using dewlance VPS&#39; and for some reason it shut off without warning and has said &quot;offline&quot; on the control panel for over an hour or so now. Has any experienced an issue like this? when I hit the &quot;boot&quot; or &quot;reboot&quot; button it doesn&#39;t do anything even though it states it is in the process of doing so. I have used there services before and even with a lower-end vps and never had to come across this issue.

I also have contacted them with no reply.</description>
