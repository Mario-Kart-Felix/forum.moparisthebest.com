<p>Its the principal that matters, really.</p>
<p>Do you let people go around stealing shit from you?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In the end this is true. There have been times before where I wish at the moment I had less control over my actions and let myself loose. If I had found someone was stealing and rummaging through my bag, I would want to probably smash a chair into their face too, I just don’t have the lack of control to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So you would risk giving someone internal brain injury over a soda?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I would if they stole something from me, especially if it was concealed in a private area. I’m pretty sure it was a last resort, and probably was discussed for a few minutes until the person finally had enough.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Do you realize what you are saying? You’re saying you would risk giving this guy a brain damage over a $1.50 can of soda, compared to $1.50 I wouldn’t want jail/juvy time nor having to be the one responsible for giving the kid brain injury or even death. I would understand a small shove over but smacking the kid over with a desk, around me I would fight for the kid in blue. Plus it’s not like the kid couldn’t have paid him off[/quote]<br>
Why do you keep using a biased interpretation of the situation? The ideal of it remains the same, no matter what item was stolen or what the victim decided to do. Of course, I do believe that both people should be punished, but they should be punished based by the crime they committed. If you steal something from a store, whether it be cheap candy or a flat screen television, you can legally only be punished for theft.</p>

That made me chuckle. Losing a soda wouldn’t have lost the red guy respect, beating the blue kid up would have. Why? Because beating the shit out of some kid who stole a soda is obviously blowing out of proportion. This is all just some highschool teen immaturity, you’ll find once you grow up (i hope) beating the shit out of your co-worker will get you fired and put you into a position where you probably wont be able to support your family or maybe even yourself. The kid was lucky he wasn’t charged with anything because in the end a living life weighs down the scales a lot more than a can full of sugar. If you think what the red kid done was ethically right then sir, why are you considered humane.<br>

I also never said what the kid did was right. But how does someone stealing from you not lose your respect for said person again?[/quote]<br>
If anyone out of them both the person who would have lost respect would have been the thief. Thieves are not loved by anyone but then someone who beats the shit out of someone else is even more frowned upon</p>

<p>In the end this is true. There have been times before where I wish at the moment I had less control over my actions and let myself loose.

<p>Do you realize what you are saying? You’re saying you would risk giving this guy a brain damage over a $1.50 can of soda, compared to $1.50 I wouldn’t want jail/juvy time nor having to be the one responsible for giving the kid brain injury or even death.

This is the same risk of ANY confrontation. I could just as easily throw a right hand hook and hit the side of their skull, force force my palm into their nose, or punch them in the back of the head. I could just throw him to the ground and have him hit his head on the ground. All of these situations of course would be not within the intention of killing a person.

Yes but what he did was intentional and direct impact</p>

He could have probably killed the kid because someone merely disrespected him (who is he to have earned any kind of respect anyways? If he’s someone that resorts to pummeling someone with a god damned desk he’s surely not someone who deserves any kind of respect to begin with).</p>
