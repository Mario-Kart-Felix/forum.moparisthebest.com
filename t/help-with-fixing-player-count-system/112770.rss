    <description>Hello members of the moparscape community!
How do i fix the player count system? I notice a lot of servers have that problem. Is there already a fix for this or do i have to make it my self. Thirteen people could be logged in and it would say twenty people were logged in. I stopped the nulls from being displayed. As that was such an easy fix. I was just trying 2 find the lazy way out. 
Tell me if i need to be more specific.
Thanks.</description>

<p>Yeah, having it where only 20 people can log on is kind of a hasle. Just set it higher to around 30-35.</p>
