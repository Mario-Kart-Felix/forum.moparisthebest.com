[b]You can check out the repository [url=https://www.github.com/open-animus/dominus-engine]here[/url].[/b]

[b][i]Note: There has been a lack of development recently due to the fact that I&#39;m currently undergoing the process of moving to my dorm room at ASU. Development will resume on the 12th, and I plan to have quite a large engine overhaul pushed to Github on the 17th; therefore, it is not recommended that anyone attempt to use this until I&#39;ve cleaned this mess up on the aforementioned date.[/i][/b]
