<p>that’s better, however professionals still don’t even like calling it a superset, subset, extension, whatever.  it is considered it’s own language. java can natively support C as well.</p>

<p>Yes, I am aware of JNI; however the native code is not compiled by javac whereas a c++ compiler (ex: g++) can compile C code.<br>
[/quote]there are some subtle gotchas in C++ that invalidate this when technically speaking, not all C++ compilers will compile C code identically to how a C compiler would do it.</p>
<p>i don’t see why people use reasoning that C++ is influenced heavily by C and therefore can’t be shit without C being shit, the reason for me thinking C++ is shit is because it’s taken just about everything under the sun and crammed it into one language without any actual consideration. there’s so many different language features created to address one problem it’s unreal and really does stink of a poorly thought out language with much more bloat than needed. i really don’t mind large languages with lots of concepts (ie. Haskell), but i hate it when all these concepts are either superfluous and/or appear to be bolted on to the language as a little extension to please a small pocket of cargo-cult programmers who absolutely love one concept to bits that they think C++ should include it… since… well why the hell not?[/quote]</p>
<p>Give a few examples of those features that have been crammed into C++ and shouldn’t be there. I’d also like you to give examples of those ‘so many different language features for doing one thing’ that get you confused when picking the right one. The C++ standard’s committee consists of a lot of people - they don’t just add stuff, they consider it carefully, voting takes place.</p>

<p>Went over these links quickly. It’s mostly about how C++ is so difficult and it’s easy to make a mistake, and how the compiler doesn’t tell you about every possible error out there. Errors are the programmer’s fault and the compiler isn’t there to babysit you. Only a small amount of those arguments were valid, but not anymore - C++11 solves those issues.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
I read through this <a href="http://www.fefe.de/c++/c++-talk.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">www.fefe.de/c++/c%2B%2B-talk.pdf</a> as it seemed to be the most hateful out of all. All it contained was bullshit, in fact the author seems to be an idiot. Given C++'s complexity, to properly criticize it you have to be an expert in it to not make any mistakes. However, you simply don’t become a C++ expert to start hating it.</p>

<p>also, mopar, when i used kubuntu, i had issues with EVERYTHING. i guess i was not used to the way it was set up. also, i HATE how it locks you out of a root acc (when you first run it). you have to change the root password, then login to su. i guess thats their way of making it more user friendly.</p>

<p>extension: A part that is added to something to enlarge or prolong it; a continuation.<br>
superset: In mathematics, especially in set theory, a set A is a subset of a set B if A is “contained” inside B. A and B may coincide.</p>
<p>Fair enough, the word I was looking for was superset.</p>

<p>that’s better, however professionals still don’t even like calling it a superset, subset, extension, whatever.  it is considered it’s own language. java can natively support C as well.</p>
<p>c++ is its own language, either way.</p>

<p>Yes, I am aware of JNI; however the native code is not compiled by javac whereas a c++ compiler (ex: g++) can compile C code.<br>
[/quote]there are some subtle gotchas in C++ that invalidate this when technically speaking, not all C++ compilers will compile C code identically to how a C compiler would do it.</p>
<p>i don’t see why people use reasoning that C++ is influenced heavily by C and therefore can’t be shit without C being shit, the reason for me thinking C++ is shit is because it’s taken just about everything under the sun and crammed it into one language without any actual consideration. there’s so many different language features created to address one problem it’s unreal and really does stink of a poorly thought out language with much more bloat than needed. i really don’t mind large languages with lots of concepts (ie. Haskell), but i hate it when all these concepts are either superfluous and/or appear to be bolted on to the language as a little extension to please a small pocket of cargo-cult programmers who absolutely love one concept to bits that they think C++ should include it… since… well why the hell not?</p>

</aside>
<p>Give a few examples of those features that have been crammed into C++ and shouldn’t be there. I’d also like you to give examples of those ‘so many different language features for doing one thing’ that get you confused when picking the right one. The C++ standard’s committee consists of a lot of people - they don’t just add stuff, they consider it carefully, voting takes place.</p>

<p>Went over these links quickly. It’s mostly about how C++ is so difficult and it’s easy to make a mistake, and how the compiler doesn’t tell you about every possible error out there. Errors are the programmer’s fault and the compiler isn’t there to babysit you. Only a small amount of those arguments were valid, but not anymore - C++11 solves those issues.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
I read through this <a href="http://www.fefe.de/c++/c++-talk.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">www.fefe.de/c++/c%2B%2B-talk.pdf</a> as it seemed to be the most hateful out of all. All it contained was bullshit, in fact the author seems to be an idiot. Given C++'s complexity, to properly criticize it you have to be an expert in it to not make any mistakes. However, you simply don’t become a C++ expert to start hating it.[/quote]pointers, references, smart pointers come quickly to mind of features that really do attempt to solve the same problems, essentially. there’s also the fun in playing around with functions, function pointers, functors (functionoids to some), anonymous functions (which boil down to the previous) and the various other beautiful things built upon these conceptually sound but collectively awful things, ie. the STL algorithms accepting functions and functors because duplicating your functionality to allow for people to mix up what they’re doing is a great example of the ridiculous and superfluous complexity. arguing flexibility is a completely moot point here, i think we all know that one way of passing around function-like constructs is more than enough. i do realise that the standards committee are present in the ratifying and construction of new standards, but evidently they’re still in the mindset that incorporating everything is a good idea. that is not careful considering from a bystander’s point of view.</p>
<p>C++ is difficult, so are many languages, but C++ is difficult because it’s overly complex and easy to make awful mistakes in. i don’t understand why you don’t want a babysitting compiler though, since a babysitting compiler is a better compiler; fixing your mistakes at compile time is much more desirable than spending hours debugging a runtime bug stemming from a silly mistake that the compiler probably could have picked up on its own had it been a qualified babysitter. i think you’ll realise on your own that a compiler that sees more mistakes in your code can be extremely useful when you’re on a tight deadline with your job on the table.</p>
<p>the author of that presentation, Felix von Leitner, i believe is much more qualified to talk about standard libraries and language design than anyone else considering he is the creator and maintainer of dietlibc (a tiny C standard library implementation for use in embeddable applications), and really i think it was more of an exemplar of <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?HaHaOnlySerious" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Ha Ha Only Serious</a> humour than an actual hateful criticism, it points out the ambiguities in C++'s syntax that often leaves maintainers and adopters of codebases guessing what a certain line does and since you evidently don’t have much maintenance experience, you seem to have missed the actual wisdom of that slideshow. i think you’ll get it eventually.</p>

<p>oh wait, let’s add std::function to my previous list too! why the hell are these all needed? function objects can maintain state, true, but what i don’t see is why all these different ways of expressing a function are required. surely it would be easier just to drop the whole idea of a traditional C function and work purely with things boiling down to std::functions so that there’s no plethora of types that you must deal with.</p>

<p>C++ still trying to retain somewhat backwards compatibility with C is stupid, i don’t see why they ever chose to keep it that way, but there we go, D exists for when you get fed up.</p>

also, mopar, when i used kubuntu, i had issues with EVERYTHING. i guess i was not used to the way it was set up. also, i HATE how it locks you out of a root acc (when you first run it). you have to change the root password, then login to su. i guess thats their way of making it more user friendly.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Nothing a quick ‘sudo passwd root’ can’t fix.</p>
<p>They do it that way because best practice says you really shouldn’t need to use the root account, because you can really mess things up if you do something wrong.[/quote]</p>
<p>oh i see, they dont want you overwriting the /boot directory or something :P. that would be bad. XD.</p>
<p>i guess some people like it the new ‘safer’ way of doing it, and some people like the ‘old-school’ way. it just depends what you like, and what your used to useing.</p>

<p>C++ is difficult, so are many languages, but C++ is difficult because it’s overly complex and easy to make awful mistakes in. i don’t understand why you don’t want a babysitting compiler though, since a babysitting compiler is a better compiler; fixing your mistakes at compile time is much more desirable than spending hours debugging a runtime bug stemming from a silly mistake that the compiler probably could have picked up on its own had it been a qualified babysitter. i think you’ll realise on your own that a compiler that sees more mistakes in your code can be extremely useful when you’re on a tight deadline with your job on the table.</p>

<p>Pointers, references, smart pointers: What’s the confusion here? Pointers point to dynamically allocated objects, you use smart pointers if you don’t want to call ‘delete’ yourself. References are there to effectively pass around stack allocated objects. In fact C# also has references (ref/out keywords).</p>
<p>Functions, function pointers, function objects: Why do you care about the STL algorithms accepting them all? If it creates confusion in your own code, then you can just wrap them all in std::function to have a unified picture. Function objects are quite useful when you need to maintain state.</p>
<p>The author of the presentation can be a C guru all he wants, but there are many mistakes in his “C++ story”. Also, at times he complains about things that bring up the question “why the fuck would anyone even want to do this?”.</p>
<p>The only thing I don’t like about C++ is that it started as a ‘superset’ of C and has since maintained compatibility with it - this results in some feature-duplication. But it’s really not an issue if you always write C++ and resort to C only if needed.<br>
[/quote]passing around stack allocated objects can also be done with pointers though, which is an archaic C way but still allowed in the language, and many people do it. i’m sure there’s also a lot of passing of various smart pointers going on in the wild, the problem is the overlap of features which either completely deprecates one or gives rise to confusion when abusing the others.</p>
<p>oh wait, let’s add std::function to my previous list too! why the hell are these all needed? function objects can maintain state, true, but what i don’t see is why all these different ways of expressing a function are required. surely it would be easier just to drop the whole idea of a traditional C function and work purely with things boiling down to std::functions so that there’s no plethora of types that you must deal with.</p>
<p>and you obviously haven’t been anywhere close to a real codebase if you’re asking why certain things would ever be done, because they will. certain programmers do stranger things than others, and i’m sure there’s a real world example of everything he pointed out floating around somewhere, all you have to do is take a look at codebases like the openssh one (albeit in C but still relevant for being awful on so many levels) to realise that anything that can be abused will probably be abused. yes, this delves down to poor programmers being poor, but in reality it shouldn’t be allowed.</p>
<p>C++ still trying to retain somewhat backwards compatibility with C is stupid, i don’t see why they ever chose to keep it that way, but there we go, D exists for when you get fed up.[/quote]</p>
<p>std::function is just for wrapping all the function representations you can think of (including lambdas). Example: a std::map&lt;std::string, std::function&lt;void (void)&gt;&gt; that stores a function, a function object, a lambda.</p>
<p>And of course I’ve been near a real codebase. I’ve seen bad code, but it’s the fault of incompetent programmers, no reason to blame the language. That’s why employers screen programmers by looking at their previous works and assigning them demo jobs. In fact it’s more likely that a Java programmer makes a mistake than a C or C++ programmer, people who write code in a managed language generally pay less attention to what they write.</p>
<p>Anyway, this arguing is getting nowhere. It’s not about what is right and what’s wrong. I don’t mind that C++ is versatile. You like minimalism, doing everything in a certain way, that’s ok.</p>

<p>i would also like to see proof of your speculative comment that Java programmers make more mistakes than C++ programmers, competent C++ programmers still have to worry about the various things that C++ can bend them over with while the majority of Java bugs are more likely to be logic errors or clumsy mistakes, due to the lack of control that it gives the programmer. you have a point that i shouldn’t blame the language for the tremendous amounts of incompetent programmers that use it, but surely their incompetency comes from the overcomplexities?</p>
<p>finally, why do you think minimalism implies exiguity in solutions? it shows that one can do lots with very little, ie. the minimalistic nature of Lisp gives rise to incredible power and flexibility, hence why it has the reputation of being one of the most, if not the most powerful and flexible language. i would rather you not assume that minimalism is rigidity.</p>
<p>and this really isn’t going anywhere is it? C++ has a reputation of having an underexperienced userbase and a complexity level that hits the sky, i don’t think that will ever change.</p>

<p>I’ll continue this thread. I actually have a love-hate relationship with C++, there are times when I really hate it. Mostly because they don’t add important libraries early and are always too late. Almost every 3rd party application programming framework has it’s own string class, STL classes (Qt duplicates the STL), threading classes, networking classes, because in a distant past there was no STL, no threads in C++. Now there’s std::thread, where does it fit (doesn’t integrate with existing frameworks)? Next step is to standardize libraries based on Boost.Filesystem and Boost.Asio. This is a serious problem. By the time the standard’s committee decides to add a library, all places are full of 3rd party libraries with similar functionality.</p>

i believe requiring a wrapper around various representations of basically the same thing indicates a design flaw in the language, <span class="bbcode-b">they should have introduced it earlier</span> on and used std::function as an underlying representation of everything anyway.<br>

<p>I’ll continue this thread. I actually have a love-hate relationship with C++, there are times when I really hate it. Mostly because they don’t add important libraries early and are always too late. Almost every 3rd party application programming framework has it’s own string class, STL classes (Qt duplicates the STL), threading classes, networking classes, because in a distant past there was no STL, no threads in C++. Now there’s std::thread, where does it fit (doesn’t integrate with existing frameworks)? Next step is to standardize libraries based on Boost.Filesystem and Boost.Asio. This is a serious problem. By the time the standard’s committee decides to add a library, all places are full of 3rd party libraries with similar functionality.[/quote]that too is one of my pet hates with C++, it’s a shame really. C++ would definitely be better off being the early bird with those things.</p>
