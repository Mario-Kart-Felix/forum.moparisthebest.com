    <title>Need Help With My Second Model</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-second-model/267937</link>
    <description>Okay, I know I made a few good modellers mad, and I apologize. But, I would appreciate some help with this problem I have.

Just a look at how I&#39;ve started out.

It is a little 3D, but only from raised faces. The other side has not been added, and i need a few tips with that as well...

Okay, the Move tool isn&#39;t working for me for some reason. I need to raise a few faces before going on and mirroring or whatever I decide to do.... And tips on colors would be nice, as green was just to start out. All constructive criticism is welcome.

But, looking at it, I think it is TONS better than the first piece of garbage I made. All thanks to SilentCJ&#39;s vid.

              <p>Well…For the colors…Hmmm. Try a black or dark red blade maybe? Looks like a kind of ‘dark’ sword in my opinion…Maybe make the hilt red and add a little gold at the end and maybe the top of the hilt…</p>
<p>Looks awesome, btw. Wish I could model like that. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
