    <description>[center]Hi Recently i&#39;ve noticed that there wasn&#39;t really Customs on DSPK, People say People Don&#39;t Want Customs for DSPK, but i have proof they do. In the first month (still in my first month) my total players at its peak was 62. We regularly have 36-47 now. The name is Myth-Scape And These are the customs i&#39;ve made so far, there are definetly more here to come.
[u][b]I would also like to know what Customs you think would be cool to add to Dspk, post as a reply[/b][/u]

I&#39;m willing to help anybody with Customs. And if requested enough i&#39;ll release a tut, I would definetly Tell you to follow I Vain I&#39;s Tutorial on how to do this, but as you can see i was able to add recolors and customs.

              <p>At least add a little more information than this, and I don’t support the custom items. Though whatever, members must love the customs for a reason.</p>
<p>Good luck with the development.</p>
