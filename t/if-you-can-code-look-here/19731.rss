    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-you-can-code-look-here/19731</link>
    <description>Well I have so many ideas that would make servers better so I thougth why don&#39;t I just make a server. So I tried to make a server but I&#39;m clueless. Ok well so if there is any expert coders there or you don&#39;t have to be an expert just know what you are doing then message me on here. Well if you want to know any of the ideas here you go.

Starter Kits- 2M, hammer, 1000 bronze bars and a bronze pick axe.

Shops 
-hat sell rares besides Phats/H&#39;ween/Santas..So it will sell other rare drops.
-Armor such as God/trimmed/Dragon
-Weapons all from rune up
-Barrows shop
++more


Codes- None. Only smithing codes. There will be alot of drops.


FUN EVENTS!!!
-The first day the server opens I will drop 3H&#39;ween masks (3ea. color
3 blue phats,3 red phats,1 white phat,2 Sets full guthix, 2 sets full zammy, 2 sets full
++ more rare stuff.
-On Holloween if I get the server up before there I&#39;ll drop 7 of ea. color of h&#39;ween mask.
-On my birthday (November 10) I will drop5 phats 5 of ea. color.
-On christmas I will drop 10 Santas+At some time on Christmas Eve I will stay in one spot in varrock or falador and everyone WAITS there turn and ask me 1 thing tehy want for christmas but itcant be phats/h&#39;ween masks/santas.
-On New Years Day there will be a Drop Party

+++ more Holiday fun on Holidays between there.

SO..JSUT MESSAGE ME IF YOU INTRESTED IN GOING PARTNERS WITH ME ON MAKING A SERVER. AND DON&#39;T ASK TO BE MODS BEFORE TIME I DONT EVEN KNOW IF THIS SI GOING TO HAPPEN


UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

              <p>[quote=“mod taharok, post:11, topic:19731”]I can say this for the whole community to hear. I started private servers 2 months ago (late Auguts), and I figured out moparscape by myself. I found out about forums and used them to download Project 16 v3.0. I then (with my bros advice [he knows tons about computers, but he doesnt know java like me]), set my server online. I found out how to edit cfgs (be myself), and then I started to love modifying servers. I then upgraded to Project 16 v4.5 after using v3 for a few weeks. I then saw on mopar forums how to fix compile error and the guide didnt work. But using it I fixed it myself - ha! I then started editing the sources of the p16s. I upgraded to p16 v6 for about 2 seconds and then went back down to 4.5 because 6’s auto-saver was broken. I then found it a nuicense to use the p16s, so I upgraded to Testscape. Then I went on a coding freenzy. I started using Testscape about four to five weeks ago. And after about one week using Testscape I made a moparscape account (with difficulties at the time, but I got it working all the same [as you can tell]). Then I started learning like mad (figuring out all by myself). I looked at other people’s tutorial but rarely used them. I looked at them to learn from them, not to use them. Then I started making my own tutorials. And that brings my back to my point. I figured out how to code all by myself and I loved it so much. You should stop being lazy and have other people do stuff for you - this will get you nowhere in life. You have to work your but off to survive in the real world and you have to work you but off to make yourself known to other people in this community. I hope you read, understood, and will follow throught this story. And also, this is what really happened. Enjoy my summary of the last two months of my on computers!</p>

<p>Although I agree he needs to make his own server, I just want to let you know, I don’t think you’re a hero. I did the same thing you did. I don’t go around posting it. I don’t feel any sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>I also don’t believe you fixed your compile without a guide. You said the one on the forums didn’t work and you fixed it yourself. I believe what really happened is you were like “omgz no paf speksified???one how do i fix dis!11oneshiftslamkeyboard” and then you realize you don’t have Version 6, you have version 8. So you’re like “SHIZZLEZ i is so close to leet prisate serber!11one how i do dis!11oneeleven omg 6 = 8!!1oneshiftctrl+htopbox6bottombox8!!!”</p>
<p>And besides that, what BIG THING have you done that I haven’t noticed? I think that would be teh kee kraftin, which I could’ve made.</p>
<p>Lastly, before you go ranting me on “omg u nub wat big ting has u dun??”…I haven’t done anything big. And I don’t have a problem with it.</p>
<p>Kthxbye.</p>
