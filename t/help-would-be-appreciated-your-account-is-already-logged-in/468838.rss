    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-would-be-appreciated-your-account-is-already-logged-in/468838</link>
    <description>Okay, before anyone says that I need a different source or something of the sort, I am not trying to log into someone elses server, just the moparscape client itself.

I had successfully done it on the webclient and the downloadable one a few days ago but it seems whatever password/username that I use it says &quot;your account is already logged in&quot;

If anyone has an explanation please state it along with a detailed way on how to fix it.

Would be very appreciative :D</description>
