    <description>I wrote this today, tell me what you think about it so far...


King Beningston III was, and always will be known as an idiot; but no one knew that. He was born into wealth, nobility, and stupidity, all being necessities to properly govern the great Ignoranté kingdom. The nation was divided into five provinces: Purgatory, Hellfire, Hellhole, Devilland, and the capitol, Ohshititisgettingreallyhotinhere. King Beningston belated mother died in childbirth due to her kingly son entering the world via her arse, with entrails spewing across the once pink floor, painting it dark red. 
	
Beningston believed (as many others in his time) he was created in the act of foreplay, not during sexual intercourse. Our version of the actual creation of a human being today, is mere child’s-play, quite literally. King Beningston III was often a victim of his father’s (Rinkard) experimental behaviors, and/or child’s play. It involved numerous toys, none of which were enjoyable to him. An excerpt from his father’s dairy explains his feelings of contempt towards his “stupid-ass” son.

	“I used my stupid ass son for child’s play today; he was much less burdensome than the young stallion I eloped with today, which continuously reared me in the testicles. Did he not know that I was king?”

	This excerpt leaves a controversial question: did King Rinkard care more for the stallion more than his son? This next excerpt from his father’s dairy is often referenced to back up to a pro-stallion argument.

	“I care more about this damn stallion than my godforsaken son.”

	The young prince resorted to abnormal behaviors due to his father’s sexual abuse. A servant-boy on his way to clean his room recalled this in his personal diary:

	“While I was a’headin’ down to the prince’s chambers, I saw him shoving a rooster into his trousers, beaming while doing so. Repeating this technique until the rooster suffocated, and the prince ate him right there and then.”

	Following these strange occurrences, numerous pairs of lingerie were reported missing from King Rinkard’s chambers, as said in King Rinkard’s personal diary, he stated:

	“Some dumbarse stole numerous pairs of lingerie from my chambers; my stupid ass son won’t have any clothes to wear while I use him for child’s play. I guess I will make do…”

	Years later King Beningston recalls these few days as “the time of my life”, feeling so utterly connected to his father, other than a penis to ass connection. It was much, much more to him than that. Oh sure, the physical part was great (well for his father that is), but he actually felt his father cared for him. He was wrong; “Daddy doesn’t care” was later published by King Rinkard showing his utter disdain for his son.

	King Beningston attempted to end his life numerous times, but was stopped only by his pure stupidity, nothing more. He lit himself on fire, only to end up jumping into a jug of kerosene (believing it was water), and nearly burned down the entire castle, lucking his father was there to throw him off the side of the castle wall, landing in the moat.</description>
