    <description>well its been a long time but i planed to post this as just a idea but
as many people know the hardest part of Rs privet servers is the model part and i have a proposition we can make the models but we cant repack them exactly but i have a idea 
build a custom compression program that packs them down and dose basicly what we have been trying to do but we need to do this the resone we cant repack it is the compression codec so we make our own it might take a while but i think its not to far way and the best part is we can use common model makeing programs to make the objects then run them threw a custom converter then a packer i have some ideas for how we could get this common goal but im going to need a team i can get the objects required but i need a team of semi skilled programers must meet the following requirements
-----------------------------------------

End of first list
----------------------------------------

skilled in JAVA
have a basic understanding of model and client codeing
