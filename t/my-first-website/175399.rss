    <title>My First Website</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-website/175399</link>
    <description>Ok, well this is my first website and I was wandering if you guys would be kind enough to give it a look over and report any gramatical errors/problems with the website you see. FYI: The website is nowhere near finished and the only page that really has anything is the homepage. This is mostly to make sure of any graphics or link problems etc. So all feedback would be greatly apreciated.

Website: [url=http://www.rsdb.ulmb.com]www.rsdb.ulmb.com[/url]

Thanks for reading. 
NOTE: this is not an advertisement. I am just trying to get some feedback because, as you can see, it is my first website. Thanks.

Edite1: Also this website was made from scratch. All the graphics were made by me in photshop. They are all mine and no one can claim them as their own. And no I did no use a template.</description>

              <p>the buttons make my eyes bleed. Make the text more easier to see. and the black box around the nav ruins it. the screen shot stuff and that other thing put to the side (like the right down) aside to the news on the left.</p>
