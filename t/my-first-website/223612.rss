              <p>Although I used Freewebs myself when I first started doing web programming, it’s a very low-featured <span class="bbcode-s">and shitty</span> website hoster. I suggest you start at <a href="http://www.unlimitedmb.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.unlimitedmb.com</a>. It’s free, you can upload PHP scripts, and they have a pretty decent free plan (you get a good amount of space for scripts), but NEVER buy from them, they have prices way over the average website hoster. I would get a cheap computer (anything with &lt; 256 MB of RAM) and take everything off of it, throw on some Linux distribution and run LLMP. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
