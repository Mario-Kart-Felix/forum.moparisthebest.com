    <description>Ok so I got the emote set for runecbow and its a wep now and everything, and also the Dbolt, ok the Dbolt
goes into the right spot where its suppose too but heres my problem

The rune-cbow will shoot with out dbolts - how can I make so that it will not shoot without bolts

Also If you have bolts in your inv when you shoot them it does not leave your inventory like a rune arrow would if you shot it, any way too make it so they actually leave you range inventory everytime you shoot like mage bow and rune arrows?</description>
