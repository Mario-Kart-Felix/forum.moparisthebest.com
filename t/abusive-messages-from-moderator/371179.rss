    <description>Abusive messages I have received from &#39;Moderator Greeny&#39;

NOTE : I have already taken my warning against having another account, the account was permanently banned and I do not have any more accounts.

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, I don&#39;t stop when it comes to young, obnoxious, arrogant morons who think they know better than anyone. 

Look kid, you are stupid, really fucking stupid to have even taken this argument this far. It&#39;s not easy to rip a little shit like you to bits, but I&#39;ve already done that publicly which is why I&#39;m PMing you. No need to embarrass you any further now, is there?

You can&#39;t spell, punctuate, construct coherent or logical sentences. Your arguments are void by your own hypocrisy and your attempts at threatening me just make you look more moronic. 

Unfortunately I&#39;ve had PMs about you owning multiple accounts, and I&#39;m obliged as staff to investigate. So this message is basically a heads up that if this is true it is a ban-able offence and I&#39;ll gladly not have to see your god awful posts appearing on this forum any more. G&#39;day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[quote]Think about this, and don&#39;t take one fucking look at this and say &#39;what a big block of spam and flame&#39;, because it&#39;s my opinion.[/quote]

The last paragraph isn&#39;t but.. you said you&#39;re 15 you are a child. I wouldn&#39;t be bothered by age it just annoys me when some condescending idiot thinks he can call me the kid when he&#39;s 5 years younger than me. So why the fuck are you arguing about that? That&#39;s obnoxious as hell you moron.

Want to know where your arrogance and stupidity arise from, comments like this:
Quote
seeing that I&#39;m the one who stops that just shows that your maturity keeps you going, right? You haven&#39;t &#39;ripped me to bits&#39;, if so, how?

You haven&#39;t stopped, you just kept going. Idiot. You&#39;re probably planning a reply in your head reading this.

Quote
I&#39;m sorry I come from a different country and maybe our spelling is different, learn about &#39;Americanization&#39; please, hypocrisy? I&#39;m sorry but that is down right disrespectful

I&#39;m British, not American. You called my language American, disrespectful shit. How&#39;s that for a taste of your own hypocrisy. I write in as best English as I can get on an English forum. Tell me what I&#39;m doing wrong. 

Haha your arguments are terrible. I only sent the PM to investigate your &quot;multiple accounts&quot; anyway. 

I have my information.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He just keeps abusing me, and if you want more proof just ask.</description>

<p>I know that you wont… Krackkid, I am not a troller or flamer at all, it’s hard to be nice if people are doing it to you all the time though, and this ‘thread’ is another point of mine, I am not a troller, flamer or I don’t think im the best, if you actually knew the situation at emps-scape you would maybe know what happened, never saw you in-game while I was talking with zodiac? No? Then stfu unless you actually know what happened.</p>

              <p>Don’t post abusive stuff in your thread? That’s all you do in other thread mate. This is my last reply here, from what I seen of you on these forums and emp, your the biggest flamer there is. I know you post graphic’s and you think your wonderful at them. But there are people that will be better then you, and flaming them doesn’t make them suck at graphic’s.</p>

</aside>
<p>Please don’t post abusively on my threads, but I will post some of my replies, it was purely a reaction and not flaming at all, I am not trolling or flaming because trollers don’t write huge blocks of text about how they are feeling. They usually produce really short messages E.g. ‘stfu n00bz’.</p>
