    <description>Has anyone watched this? What did you think of it? 

I really can&#39;t believe it has 8.2/10 on imdb. 

At the start I really thought: yes this movie is going to be awesome I just know it. Half way through it gave me that feeling you get when you meet a beautiful girl and then meet her mother who looks like an obese Jeremy Clarkson, and you just know this beautiful girl will one day wilt in to a similar figure as her mother.

Finally it ended, and so did my hopes that I would ever work out the actual storyline that the director was trying to follow.

I assume as it rated highly there will be somebody on these boards who has watched and enjoyed it, so please tell me how you did this.</description>

<p>That’s actually a technique that Quentin Tarantino uses to great effect in some movies. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’ve seen the milk shake scene, which was cool, but that’s it. Basically some scrougy priest holds out on the main character by not selling land to him so the main character can obtain the oil underneath it. Main character drinks the priest’s milkshake by extending straws into it from surrounding land. Then this is all revealed to the priest at the end when he changes his mind and tries to sell it.</p>
<p>Main character proceeds to beat priest to death for screwing him around a bit.</p>
<p>And that’s pretty much it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
