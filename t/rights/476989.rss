    <description>How do I add new rights, I already have in Commands but I don&#39;t know how to add the crowns and stuff, which file is that in? (for example 3 is admin, 2 is mod, 1 is donator, 0 is player) But when someone types in a message the admin crown shows up for 2 and mod crown shows up for 1 in public/private/clan how do I change that or is there a tutorial you could link me thx?
