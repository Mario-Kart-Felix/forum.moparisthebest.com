    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shopping-system/529129</link>
    <description>So I would like to get some advice on how you personally believe the shopping system should be done. I will be taking Sinisoul&#39;s advice about using the configs already done (I&#39;m not big on putting items in shops anyway so the normal RS shops is plenty for me ) 

What I am wondering about though is exactly how the anti dupe/cheat engine be set up? I don&#39;t know a whole lot about cheat engines. 

What would you also suggest for maximum performance?</description>

              <p>I recommend turDkill4hs anti-dupe engine, it’s purpose built for this sort of thing in mind. It uses polynomially distributed hash tables with A* lookup mechanisms, and even has an e-commerce bounce-submission detector.</p>

              <p>The reason I don’t like what sinisoul posted is that it really does leave a lot of potential to mess up the shop system if you aren’t 100% careful with all of the code you write. You’re letting the client create the shop items, which to me doesn’t really make sense. In any shop anti-dupe system you’re going to need to have the shop items saved server-sided anyways, so there’s no real point to use the configs he posted.</p>
<p>That said, here are some things you need to make sure you have that relate to anti-dupes and anti-cheats in shops:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the player has physical access to the shop in question. This is usually handled in your NPC/Object interaction packet handlers.</li>
<li>Have a player variable that keeps track of the store the player currently has open, this is much easier than creating a Shop instance for each player. Set this to -1 or whatever when they do any action that closes the shop (closing the interface, walking away, etc)</li>
<li>Store the item amounts and prices on the server… each shop should have this.</li>
</ol>
