    <description>Hi there my name is justin, my gaming name is maz &amp; i am 19 years old.

I have made several servers for a game called wolfenstein. MCF,*vsay, Trickjump
I have handed them all to my co owners wich still owns the servers and are some of the best today.

I Figured out that an RSPS is way diffrent and harder to do, thats o.k i like the challenge.

Im looking for a partner to help me With RSPS. or possibly i could help you.

*my benefits*
I have 3 computers incase we get a lot of players, we could make a brother and sister rsps. including your computer thats 4 or more.
I am very motivated to do this.
I played runescape 8 years, and know all the is to know about it. i no longer play, since rs sucks now.. hence why i am here at RSPS&#39;s! :D.
i have paypal, and i am willing to put thousands into this, to make the most successfull server.
also i play average 14 hours a day.

i need a partner who could help me out and know his shit. if this is you let me know send me a message il reply and add you to my facebook or you add me.

money could be made doing this the way i plan :D. Thanks!





I AM LOOKING TO START ASAP! im anxiously waiting for someone to reply.</description>
