    <title>Request for TuT &gt; automatic message when a player reaches lv. 99 in a skill</title>

    <description>Hello everyone,

I just started my server and I would really like to have an auto-message in it. 
As on my server, skillcapes are rare, and skilling takes long, I&#39;d really like something like this:

A message like &quot;[i]PLAYERNAME[/i] reached level 99 in [i]SKILLNAME[/i]!&quot; 
When a player reaches level 99 in any skill, that message will be sent. Including their playername and in which skill they reached it. That would be awesome!

Now I&#39;m requesting someone that can make a code for me, and tell me where I need to place it, as I do not know which file must be editted. :/ And I&#39;m &#39;kinda&#39; not good in java. 

Thanks ALOT if you can help me :D</description>
