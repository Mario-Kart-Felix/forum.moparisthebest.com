    <description>[center][u][b]Server Information[/b][/u]

[b]Calypso[/b] is a Server being developed by me and only me. Were trying to sustain as much respect as possible and a huge Community. Calypso has only been developed for atleast 1-2 weeks and is developing quite quickly. Were trying to be at the top, we can do this by; keeping our code clean, effcient and wisely detecting those memory leaks, we also like cutting out those none-used proccescors to stop the EventManager over-flowing.

[u][b]About me[/b][/u]

My name is James, i&#39;m 15 years old. I&#39;ve only joined this RuneScapePrivateServer Community today and none other. I&#39;ve been learning/programming Java for around 2-3 years so i&#39;m pretty experienced but I still have alot to learn as i&#39;m sure even the proffessionals do as well.


Yes, I know there&#39;s hardly any information, more is coming soon!

              <p>X Entinity X has taken the words from me once again, and I will have to agree with the whole 562 maps and stuff. It’s shameful that the 317 revision is being ruined with mapdata that the 317 revision shouldn’t have, at first I thought it would be amazing. However, my mind has changed about that, and I think people should keep maps to the 508 + revision, in their own place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I do believe this isn’t that bad for having such maps, and hope to not be disappointed. Good luck mate, hope this is successful.</p>

Thanks. I’ve had a roam around and I don’t see alot from scratch other then basic networking, combat and so on.<br>
This isn’t Destination Pking or whatever it’s called.<br>

<p>When people write a whole base from scratch , you know they are pro’s , we have a few of them here , and no i’m not a pro , i just try to expertise in the 317 PI base for a while.<br>
I do have plans for making a 474 from scratch when i get more experienced with java ( swing , imageicons etc , i’m taking lessons xD )<br>
again , GL , ignore flamers / haters , if you managed to do this all in 2 weeks , i’m sure you will get this to a very nice base in no time =D[/quote]</p>
<p>Just because someone can write a base from scratch it doesn’t mean their “Pro”, you just need to learn Java, its concept and how it works overall, if you want more learning experience I suggest useing <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html</a> before moving onto 474. Before all of this, get comfortable with what your doing with Project Insanity or Delta.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Topic</span> - Good luck, it’s coming along quite well although the concept of RSPS’s are to go back not forward, so I suggest removing “Loading 562/508 data”.</p>
