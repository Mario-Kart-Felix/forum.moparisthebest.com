    <description>Ok so the thing is

EVERY SINGLE NPC HAS AN UNDERSCORE INSTEAD OF A BLANK SPACE D: AND I TRIED REPLACING THE UNDERSCORES BUT THEY HAVEN&#39;T BEEN MANUALLY CHANGED! Meaning there not in entityDef.java. Any ideas on how to fix that??
Is there a way to make it not pickup &quot;_&quot;&#39;s as a actual character

If you don&#39;t know what I mean well then his is basically what&#39;s wrong:
The npc names
- Jesus_Christ
What It should be/I want it to be
- Jesus Christ


EDIT: I was wrong with how not to fix it,
To fix, simply go into EntityDef.java and search for &lt;blockquote&gt;replaceAll(&quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot;);&lt;/blockquote&gt;
You come across something like 		name = stream.readString().replaceAll(&quot;_&quot;, &quot; &quot;);
Change the (&quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot;) to &lt;blockquote&gt;(&quot;_&quot;, &quot; &quot;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
