    <title>Need Some Help With Server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-help-with-server/77130</link>
    <description>Heres the deal, I downloaded Pimpscape, added a few tuts, downloaded Hamachi, made networks, I could get on my server, nobody else could. Now I think I know what the problem is, but I&#39;m not sure on how to do this.

My problem would be port forwarding. But, everytime I type my Default IP into Internet Explorer, it says &quot;Page Cannot Be Displayed&quot; Any help would be greatly appreciated![br][size=1]Posted on: April 09, 2007, 02:45:39 AM[/size][hr]Come on, nobody even read this yet![br][size=1]Posted on: April 09, 2007, 02:50:32 AM[/size][hr]OMG Please Help![br][size=1]Posted on: April 09, 2007, 03:01:00 AM[/size][hr]PLEASE!!!!</description>

              <p>Does other know your Hamachi Networks and Passwords? You do not need an open port for Hamachi. And of course your not suppose to use Internet Explorer/Firefox to open your IP <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
