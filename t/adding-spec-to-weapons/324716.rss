    <title>Adding spec to weapons :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-spec-to-weapons/324716</link>
    <description>Ive been searching for ages for this and couldn&#39;t see it anywhere so i thought i&#39;d post it :)
right im new to coding im just having some fun with a 317 and I&#39;m trying to add special to vls and swh

vls id = 10010
swh = 10012
i know the emote i want for the specs and they are.
vls = 2890
swh = 2927

just no idea where to put them or what to do :(.

also im trying to add effects to the specials so when you use the spec it hits abit higher than normal.

not asking for whole version could you just point me in the right direction.

thanks :)</description>
