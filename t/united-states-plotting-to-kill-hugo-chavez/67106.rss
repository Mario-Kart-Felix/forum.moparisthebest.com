    <title>United States plotting to kill Hugo Chavez?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/united-states-plotting-to-kill-hugo-chavez/67106</link>
    <description>[url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=a6TJORGwN5ao&amp;refer=latin_america]http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=a6TJORGwN5ao&amp;refer=latin_america[/url]

The USA/CIA has already killed dozens of South American leaders that have leaned towards socialism, and apparently Hugo Chavez has become a great threat after he has nationalized oil in Venezuela, not to mention calling Bush the devil.
Bush recently travelled to South America to try and talk the countries out of socialism and for various other reasons including negotiating with Bolivia and praising Evo Moralis for his Ethanol research.
Obviously no country can get away with threatening our capitalist government, but Hugo Chavez is a great man and is for the people of Venezuela instead of himself or another corporate entity.
We have killed countless leaders in South America including Che Guavera, and a president of Chile who kicked some American corporations out of his country so he could give the money back to the people.(Che was buried under airport tarmac after his hands were cut off)
I think this is horrible and it is very likely that Hugo could be killed in the next few years of Bush/Cheney&#39;s presidency.
Here&#39;s a quote from the article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;March 11 (Bloomberg) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez accused his U.S. counterpart George W. Bush of plotting to assassinate him and promised ``100 years of war&#39;&#39; should harm come to him or his Bolivian ally, President Evo Morales.

``The embassies of the United States continue pushing assassination plans in our Latin American countries,&#39;&#39; he told crowds gathered today at the El Alto Air Force base in Bolivia. ``I accuse the president of the United States of being behind all these plans.&#39;&#39;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

i don’t play games first of all<br>
second i am stadying politics how they control each other and the goverment controls them.<br>
these kind of information you can not get it from books because it’s not allowed but when you are studying policties you need to lern how things work in the goverment.</p>

You are quite right, although they ARE people we know, like Karl Rove, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, etc.</p>

<p>Yea that’s why they need to postpone all his ideas. Ti’ll the Elections for the next president are coming. Then finally George Bush won’t be reigning and hopefully they will stop trying to get control of South America.</p>

<p>This is excatly what I always say too! Iraq will be Vietnam 2.0, you really can’t go to country like that, and bring so called Democracy. They should just let them settle their things and leave the whole country.<br>
But no, they are sendin another 20000 soldiers there soon. Poor young lads.</p>
