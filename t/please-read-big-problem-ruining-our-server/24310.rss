    <description>Guys i have this problem where any item that is dropped and picked up, when you walk away from the item until you can&#39;t see the place where you dropped the item on your screen and walk back to the spot, the item will be there again. We are tryin to perfect a server where you have to get items by working for them and not just getting them very easy. Please help me</description>
