I am so terrified because they can all IP ban each other and I can&#39;t delete IP bans &quot;Safely&quot; Because I might delete the wrong IP, Can anyone please help me? It was working fine then just out of random people start logging in as Co&#39;s It was working fine yesterday... I have a feelin it has something to do with Player or PlayerHandler files... Please help...
