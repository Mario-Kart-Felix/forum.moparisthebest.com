So I&#39;m having trouble with my client connecting to my source, I know this sounds stupid but trust me I&#39;m a experienced coder. And idk what&#39;s going on.
Please message me on skype for more information. It&#39;s a js5 connect error. I had someone message me already saying he could fix it.
And I explained what all the other people have said when trying to help me and he said OH. You&#39;re using rune evo v3 right, i said yes. He asked what client I said foxtrot.
he said that should work, then a few moments later he said oh, i got it. then I looked on my source cmd, and surely enough he had been connecting to me. and he was logged in and had fixed it only problem is he wants me to buy him a years of runescape membership for correcting the problem.. He also said I wouldn&#39;t find ANYONE else who could fix it.

Please help.. I can pay but minimum is like $30</description>
