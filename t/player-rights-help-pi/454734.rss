    <description>So basically I wanted the donator &quot;$&quot; next to the donator&#39;s name. So I went on to Client Class (client sided) and checked the &quot;case:&quot; for the MODICON aka the Donator image, and the case was 5. So basically that means players need to have their player rights set to &quot;5&quot; in order to get that symbol next to their name, and that actually worked.

The problem is, having player rights set to &quot;5&quot; gives you owner commands, and when I check the commands class I don&#39;t find anything that hints to player rights 5 giving owner commands or something. Is there any way to change this so player Rights 5 doesn&#39;t give you any special commands but regular player commands?</description>
