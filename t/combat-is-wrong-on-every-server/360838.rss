    <title>Combat is wrong on every server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/combat-is-wrong-on-every-server/360838</link>
    <description>So I have been playing some legitimate runescape the past few weeks and have come to the conclusion that all servers (including rsc) do combat wrong.

On all servers that I have seen combat is initiated and is controlled by timers (weapon speeds of sorts) but this is only part of the equation.

I have come to the conclusion that combat is still round based (a round consists of a time span to perform mutliple activities).

Weapons do not have Speeds they have round ticks which only appear as speeds. Proof of this would be why a user has the ability to use a scimitar then switch to a two handed sword quickly and perform another attack in a very short time span. 

Consumables do not effect your speeds of attacks but do add some sort of cool down that effects your round ticks.

Magic - Some spells are ticks some spells are cooldowns for the combat event

Range - tick based only


Example: Lets say a round is 500ms for sake of example.
Entity A: has a rune scimitar equipped which ticks at (100ms,500ms) of the round timer. Entity A is using lobsters that add a (100ms) cooldown 
Entity B: has a rune 2h hander equipped which ticks at (250ms)
Round 1:
Entity A attacks Entity B - Entity A round 1 starts on the initial attack so the first attack is free. then gets to attack again at 100ms and 500ms of round 1. Round one is now Finished for entity A
Entity B did not retaliate right away but the round as already started for entity B. Entity B retaliates at 375ms and misses his chance to attack entity A in the first round.

Round 2:
100 MS: Entity A attacks Entity B 
105 MS: Entity B eats a lobster and now has a 100ms cooldown on all attacks
250 MS: Entity B attacks entity A as the cool down has already expired 
255ms: Entity A eats a lobster and adds a 100ms cooldown
450ms: Entity a eats another lobster and resets the 100ms cooldown
500ms: Entity A misses chance to attack due to cool down from eating the lobster

Other notes:
Cooldowns expire at a end of a round so the best time to eat would be at the end of your round
Cooldowns expire when switching weapons (not when the packet is received but when the action is completed)


So any input from you lothy as I know you also play runescape from time to time.</description>

              <p>yeah the timing was made up.</p>
<p>thats interesting on the potions is it the first potion has no cooldown or all? i went out with some strength pures I can perform the first potion free of cooldown but I have a cooldown on the second.</p>
<p>It maybe that consumables have no cooldown on the first one but then start to build a cooldown.</p>

              <p>Sure, I can give you input. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>First and foremost, every weapon has at least a 1 tick (600ms) break between strikes. So while you’re probably on the money, your timing is a bit out. I imagine there’s about 2 ticks between each attack with a scimitar/whip/sara sword, and at least 6 ticks between each use of a two handed weapon.</p>
<p>Also note that drinking potions can occur right before eating a piece of food without any gap, so potions don’t seem to have any effect on the timing there. Same goes for drinking a potion and then attacking something, iirc.</p>
