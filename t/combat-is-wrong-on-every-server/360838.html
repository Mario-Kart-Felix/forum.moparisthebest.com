        <p>So I have been playing some legitimate runescape the past few weeks and have come to the conclusion that all servers (including rsc) do combat wrong.</p>
<p>On all servers that I have seen combat is initiated and is controlled by timers (weapon speeds of sorts) but this is only part of the equation.</p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that combat is still round based (a round consists of a time span to perform mutliple activities).</p>
<p>Weapons do not have Speeds they have round ticks which only appear as speeds. Proof of this would be why a user has the ability to use a scimitar then switch to a two handed sword quickly and perform another attack in a very short time span.</p>
<p>Consumables do not effect your speeds of attacks but do add some sort of cool down that effects your round ticks.</p>
<p>Magic - Some spells are ticks some spells are cooldowns for the combat event</p>
<p>Range - tick based only</p>
<p>Example: Lets say a round is 500ms for sake of example.<br>
Entity A: has a rune scimitar equipped which ticks at (100ms,500ms) of the round timer. Entity A is using lobsters that add a (100ms) cooldown<br>
Entity B: has a rune 2h hander equipped which ticks at (250ms)<br>
Round 1:<br>
Entity A attacks Entity B - Entity A round 1 starts on the initial attack so the first attack is free. then gets to attack again at 100ms and 500ms of round 1. Round one is now Finished for entity A<br>
Entity B did not retaliate right away but the round as already started for entity B. Entity B retaliates at 375ms and misses his chance to attack entity A in the first round.</p>
<p>Round 2:<br>
100 MS: Entity A attacks Entity B<br>
105 MS: Entity B eats a lobster and now has a 100ms cooldown on all attacks<br>
250 MS: Entity B attacks entity A as the cool down has already expired<br>
255ms: Entity A eats a lobster and adds a 100ms cooldown<br>
450ms: Entity a eats another lobster and resets the 100ms cooldown<br>
500ms: Entity A misses chance to attack due to cool down from eating the lobster</p>
<p>Other notes:<br>
Cooldowns expire at a end of a round so the best time to eat would be at the end of your round<br>
Cooldowns expire when switching weapons (not when the packet is received but when the action is completed)</p>
<p>So any input from you lothy as I know you also play runescape from time to time.</p>

        <p>Sure, I can give you input. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>First and foremost, every weapon has at least a 1 tick (600ms) break between strikes. So while you’re probably on the money, your timing is a bit out. I imagine there’s about 2 ticks between each attack with a scimitar/whip/sara sword, and at least 6 ticks between each use of a two handed weapon.</p>
<p>Also note that drinking potions can occur right before eating a piece of food without any gap, so potions don’t seem to have any effect on the timing there. Same goes for drinking a potion and then attacking something, iirc.</p>

        <p>yeah the timing was made up.</p>
<p>thats interesting on the potions is it the first potion has no cooldown or all? i went out with some strength pures I can perform the first potion free of cooldown but I have a cooldown on the second.</p>
<p>It maybe that consumables have no cooldown on the first one but then start to build a cooldown.</p>
