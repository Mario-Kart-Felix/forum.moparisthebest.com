    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-help-needed-with-client-ip/382352</link>
    <description>ok i&#39;ve gone into client.java and changed the ip to 127.0.0.1 but when i load the client it says: error js5connect 
basically its offline and i dont know why... 
my runserver seems to be working fine it says: 
[code]starting server on port:5555
error loading banned users list[/code]
i dont think its because of the banned user list because it says the servers starting but i dont know im using aznzsscape base can anyone help? thanks</description>
