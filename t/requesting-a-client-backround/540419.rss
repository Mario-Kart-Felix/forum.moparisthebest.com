    <title>Requesting a Client Backround</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requesting-a-client-backround/540419</link>
    <description>Hello moparscape, Virus King here! . So i come to u and my source is Aggroth and (im sorry amy) but i need to replace the backround so it matches my server name, DealtX. This is what it looks like now. http://prntscr.com/2ueajl

I would like it to be:

Backround with someone hitting a high dds smack againts someone.

On the bottom in white letters (small and 6 font) &quot;DealtX. All Rights Reserved.&quot;
Where the text says aggroth, change it to DealtX and make the letters blue and black outline in 3d (if possible)

If anybody is willing to do this, i will rep you and if u join my server when its up you will get GFX rank. Thank you!</description>
