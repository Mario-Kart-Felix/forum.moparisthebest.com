    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-not-working-after-i-added-shop/420597</link>
    <description>I just finished adding a shop to my server, but now the client wont load correctly.
what it does:
1)Everything besides the world map and graphics show up.

I&#39;ve heard that many other people have had this problem so i was wondering obviously:
How do i fix this?
Thank you for helping me get this far. But i just need to understand whats going on.
Again, help is MUCH appreciated!!

-Thanks!</description>
