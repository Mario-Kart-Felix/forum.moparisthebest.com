    <description>[url=http://www.selfinger.com/budget-ddos-protected-windows-xp-seo-vps.html]Click me[/url].

They&#39;ve apparently been around since 1999, but I can&#39;t seem to find any reviews or anything about them.

Lots of websites only show the whois about them, and nothing more. [url=http://www.scamadviser.com/is-selfinger.com-a-fake-site.html]Scamadviser[/url] says it&#39;s a trusted website, but this is the only site I&#39;ve seen give any form of feedback about this company.

All in all, they seem to offer a good deal on a protected vps.</description>
