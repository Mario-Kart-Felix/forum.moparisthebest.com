    <description>Answers some unanswered questions

[code]&lt;t4&gt; the change of heart? one can&#39;t just go from making god know&#39;s what per month to nothing over &#39;morality&#39;
&lt;Jacmob&gt; money from rsbuddy is insignificant to me
&lt;t4&gt; if it was a moral decision, especially regarding gold farmers - you could have combated that
&lt;t4&gt; furthermore, no one has seen your final update to RSBuddy
&lt;Jacmob&gt; it wasnt simply a moral decision, it was somewhat more complex than that
&lt;Jacmob&gt; the last update to rsbuddy was last friday
&lt;_^_&gt; Jacmob
&lt;t4&gt; so you released a working copy?
* Discardedx2 has quit (Quit: Leaving)
&lt;_^_&gt; unban from #rsbuddy &amp; #rscode
&lt;_^_&gt; ty
&lt;_^_&gt; plz
&lt;_^_&gt; thx
&lt;Jacmob&gt; a few people on mumble saw - it was updated with player, npc, projection, input, and widget hooks
&lt;t4&gt; okay, back to the decision to shut rsbuddy down
&lt;Jacmob&gt; people massively overhyped this cluster flutterer release of course
&lt;Jacmob&gt; idk why people like Speljohan_ made idiotic comments about it being impossible to deal with
&lt;t4&gt; it seems as if you were threatened or bribed in the same manner Speljohan_ was.
&lt;Mopman&gt; to be fiar, he didnt
&lt;Mopman&gt; he made one comment and it got blown up
&lt;Mopman&gt; by other people
&lt;Jacmob&gt; ah okay
&lt;Mopman&gt; Jacmob: is it true youre owrking at jagex nao? :P
&lt;Mopman&gt; njo hate or anything im just curious
&lt;Jacmob&gt; yes
&lt;t4&gt; specially frell 
&lt;Mopman&gt; Jacmob: thats awesome, gz
&lt;Jacmob&gt; well i havent started yet Mopman 
&lt;t4&gt; Jacmob: i have no problem with your decision btw
&lt;Mopman&gt; IF I APLLY TO SOME SHIT DEPT LIKE CUSTOMER SERVICE CAN YOU TELL THEM HOW HARD WORKING AND WONDERUFL I AM LOLOL
&lt;t4&gt; just wish you were a bit more open to what exactly transpired 
&lt;Mopman&gt; Jacmob: are you gonna be moving to cambridge? or are you already near by
&lt;ramen&gt; Mopman, you should get a job at jagex too 
&lt;ramen&gt; resume: administrator on moparisthebest.com
&lt;Jacmob&gt; since im still at skl in london for now sorting out access and collaboration is still in progress
&lt;Jacmob&gt; after that if i&#39;m in cambridge at uni there&#39;s less of an issue
&lt;Mopman&gt; jagex is just a blap down the a14 for me
&lt;Mopman&gt; ive considered applying to jagex before but id never get aj ob there lol
&lt;Jacmob&gt; i dont want that repeated really but i guess some people will feel the need to go spreading it around
&lt;_^_&gt; Mopman: what was the comment
&lt;Mopman&gt; its already
&lt;Mopman&gt; massive rumour man
&lt;Mopman&gt; ive been told about 50 times in the last 2 days
&lt;Mopman&gt; thats why i asked
&lt;Jacmob&gt; of course, that&#39;s fine
&lt;t4&gt; yeah Jacmob, for one i won&#39;t spread this convo
&lt;Jacmob&gt; just don&#39;t want to confirm yet
&lt;_^_&gt; &lt;Mopman&gt; ive considered applying to jagex before but id never get aj ob there lol
&lt;t4&gt; although others will
&lt;_^_&gt; you are not genius material
&lt;_^_&gt; you&#39;re above average at best
&lt;_^_&gt; don&#39;t consider
&lt;Jacmob&gt; but i&#39;m tired of rumours at this point so w/e
&lt;t4&gt; Jacmob: so, they hired you under the ground to shut down rsbuddy?
&lt;Jacmob&gt; especially bullshit about how i love money when i&#39;ve turned down making plenty of money of numerous occasions
&lt;Jacmob&gt; on*
&lt;_^_&gt; t4 how important was rsbuddy to you
&lt;ramen&gt; rsbuddy was t4&#39;s life
&lt;t4&gt; _^_: not so much
&lt;Jacmob&gt; no t4
&lt;Jacmob&gt; not to shut down rsbuddy
&lt;Jacmob&gt; to work on the game engine
&lt;Jacmob&gt; more detail about that is confidential though
&lt;Mopman&gt; Jacmob: did you actually show them your bot as leverage for this job
&lt;Mopman&gt; cuz im surprised theyd hire
&lt;Mopman&gt; like
&lt;Mopman&gt; an undergrad
&lt;Mopman&gt; for real code
&lt;Mopman&gt; these days
&lt;Mopman&gt; thats pretty cool
&lt;Jacmob&gt; there are other factors 
&lt;t4&gt; so you weren&#39;t ordered to stop the production of rsbuddy, Jacmob ?
&lt;Mopman&gt; t4: haha, its pretty obvious
&lt;Mopman&gt; that he couldnt continuewhile working there
&lt;t4&gt; Mopman: well duh
&lt;Jacmob&gt; oh ofc i had to stop rsbuddy
&lt;Jacmob&gt; indeed, rsbuddy would have become much harder to keep running
&lt;Jacmob&gt; it would inevitably have gone down within a few months at most
&lt;t4&gt; Jacmob: so you would say it was less of a threat, more of an opportunity?
* Davidi2_LINUX is now known as Davidi2
&lt;Mopman&gt; Jacmob: so they do know exactly who you are
&lt;Mopman&gt; is what i was really wondering
&lt;Mopman&gt; hehe
&lt;Jacmob&gt; they know exactly who a lot of people are
&lt;Mopman&gt; heh
&lt;t4&gt; i&#39;m referring to what transpired between you and jagex
&lt;Mopman&gt; RUH OH
&lt;Jacmob&gt; i agreed with jagex about a lot of things t4
&lt;t4&gt; such as?
&lt;Jacmob&gt; i didnt make rsbuddy because i love the idea of people cheating in runescape
&lt;ramen&gt; is this confiedntialinformation
&lt;Jacmob&gt; i am pretty indifferent to the issue
&lt;Mopman&gt; i can honestly see
* SeanWT (pre@mopar-FE7F5534.sgyl.cable.virginmedia.com) has joined #mopar
&lt;Mopman&gt; that position
&lt;Mopman&gt; like, there was talk among the people who devd aryan (ohi SeanWT )
&lt;Mopman&gt; about how not all of them
&lt;Mopman&gt; were happy with
&lt;Mopman&gt; its impact on the  game
&lt;t4&gt; Jacmob: i actually hate botting/botters
&lt;Jacmob&gt; the impact on the game is complex as is my position of it
&lt;Jacmob&gt; on*
&lt;t4&gt; they really exploit the system
&lt;Jacmob&gt; gold farmers exploit the system
&lt;Jacmob&gt; i already had plans to shut them out
&lt;Jacmob&gt; but as long as there&#39;s botting
&lt;Jacmob&gt; there will be a bot developer
&lt;Jacmob&gt; who doesnt care to
&lt;SeanWT&gt; im going to start a gold farm
&lt;t4&gt; the users do too, Jacmob :P
&lt;Mopman&gt; plant gold seeds
&lt;SeanWT&gt; I bought 20 of sams future children
&lt;t4&gt; frost dragon scripts, barrows scripts
&lt;Jacmob&gt; yes but it&#39;s a spectrum t4
&lt;SeanWT&gt; he said he would fulfil the order within a week
&lt;t4&gt; seriously :P
&lt;SeanWT&gt; he must be a pimp
&lt;Jacmob&gt; and there&#39;s a threshold
&lt;Brolapse&gt; Speljohan_, we shud play bf3 sometime
&lt;Brolapse&gt; i need to get a mic tho
&lt;t4&gt; Jacmob: you made a statement about optical bots earlier
&lt;Jacmob&gt; what aobut them
&lt;t4&gt; something to the extent of how they&#39;ll be obsolete 
&lt;_^_&gt; SeanWT is here
&lt;_^_&gt; wow
&lt;Jacmob&gt; ah ya well
&lt;_^_&gt; have i stepped 5 years into the past
&lt;Mopman&gt; it happens sometimes
&lt;SeanWT&gt; _^_ more like 8
&lt;SeanWT&gt; yuoungin
&lt;SeanWT&gt; *youngin
&lt;t4&gt; do you have any insight on how they&#39;d (jagex) accomplish that feat?
&lt;Jacmob&gt; the idea is to reduce grind, but of course that&#39;s not a simple thing to do
&lt;_^_&gt; SeanWT: fair
&lt;SeanWT&gt; Jacmob youd only have to entirely change the game
&lt;Mopman&gt; the fact that Jacmob is still here
&lt;Jacmob&gt; these screen scraping bots are very limited
&lt;Mopman&gt; and hasnt been banned from talking to us
&lt;_^_&gt; yeah
&lt;Mopman&gt; makes me think they want to turn him into some fucking
&lt;Mopman&gt; botter liason
&lt;Mopman&gt; hahaha
&lt;SeanWT&gt; ban him cha cha cha
&lt;_^_&gt; he&#39;s the official jagex ambassador to the cheating community
&lt;_^_&gt; :D
&lt;Mopman&gt; Jacmob: THE MOUTHPIECE OF JAGEX
&lt;Jacmob&gt; well im not actually in cambridge atm
&lt;t4&gt; Jacmob: do go on
&lt;_^_&gt; Jacmob: did they have any contractual stipulations regarding what contact you are to have with the cheaters ?
&lt;Jacmob&gt; of course there may well be more detection methods coming for screen scrapers
&lt;Jacmob&gt; but i prefer the idea of making them obsolete
&lt;Jacmob&gt; because removing bots changes the gameplay
&lt;Jacmob&gt; and in some respects that change is for the worse
&lt;Jacmob&gt; it would have been easier on me if the gameplay changes had come first of course :p
&lt;t4&gt; what about the 12 year olds that have billions in the bank and several 99s, is Jagex going to do anything about them? :P
&lt;Jacmob&gt; no
&lt;SeanWT&gt; t4 they have already broke their own game multiple time because of us
&lt;SeanWT&gt; they dont want to go banning because of assumption of guilt
&lt;t4&gt; well that sure stinks, Jacmob - there will be such a divide in the runescape community
&lt;Jacmob&gt; well there&#39;s no perfect solution
&lt;SeanWT&gt; there will always be divides
&lt;_^_&gt; several former botters have declared that they will go back to playing legit
&lt;SeanWT&gt; look at party hats
&lt;Jacmob&gt; runescape has outgrown its original gameplay
&lt;SeanWT&gt; how much fucking money are they worth now
&lt;Jacmob&gt; and its hard to make it work well
&lt;t4&gt; SeanWT: ~1.5b+
&lt;_^_&gt; i would imagine they are refraining from banning people because they have found that they don&#39;t come back afterwards
&lt;SeanWT&gt; t4 in real money?
&lt;_^_&gt; it leaves a deep scar on their young fragile noob hearts
&lt;t4&gt; SeanWT: gp, obv - around 800 usd+
&lt;Cbot&gt; Jacmob: you said it was meant for compatibility when it first came out right?
&lt;SeanWT&gt; so insane
&lt;Jacmob&gt; well having removed bots, it&#39;s preferable not to have to punish the people who were so easily able to run them
&lt;SeanWT&gt; i gave most of mine away on christmas because my friends werent on for the drops
&lt;Mopman&gt; i remember selling my santas for like 15k
&lt;Mopman&gt; in retrospect
&lt;Mopman&gt; bad idea
&lt;SeanWT&gt; indeed
&lt;_^_&gt; durr
&lt;SeanWT&gt; we have had periods of bots vanishing
&lt;SeanWT&gt; they will come back
&lt;SeanWT&gt; no matter what jagex does it will always be counterable
&lt;Jacmob&gt; anyway i would refund people for longer periods
&lt;Cbot&gt; Mopman: those 5-7 years of waiting wouldn&#39;t have been worth it
&lt;Mopman&gt; SeanWT: lets do it
&lt;Jacmob&gt; unfortunately
&lt;ramen&gt; cool and Jacmob will probably get to know how far off the refactored namings in clients are
&lt;Jacmob&gt; that would mean me having to pay costs
&lt;SeanWT&gt; its just a whole different ball game right now, but people will do it
&lt;_^_&gt; SeanWT: i am worried that RS will not be coming back though
&lt;Jacmob&gt; ie i would have lost money by starting rsbuddy
&lt;_^_&gt; i&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already seen this 
&lt;_^_&gt; but
&lt;SeanWT&gt; _^_ im shocked its even still alive
&lt;SeanWT&gt; I hated rs2
&lt;SeanWT&gt; rsc pking is where it was a
&lt;SeanWT&gt; t
&lt;Jacmob&gt; because i payed out so much of the turnover on expenses
&lt;SeanWT&gt; *at
&lt;_^_&gt; http://www.google.com/trends?q=runescape&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0
&lt;Mopman&gt; Jacmob: wtf expensis did yo ueven have
&lt;Mopman&gt; iu cant understand how it was that high
&lt;t4&gt; mk Jacmob one last question i suppose
&lt;Mopman&gt; or were you just bad at monetising :P
&lt;SeanWT&gt; runescape had its place back in the day why anyone continues to play it is beyond me
&lt;Jacmob&gt; since i wanted a big infrastructure rather than more money
&lt;SeanWT&gt; but with the money jagex has im sure they can offer something of value
&lt;_^_&gt; SeanWT: have you noticed that everyone thinks that runescape was best during whatever time they happened to join it, and everything afterwards is crap ?
&lt;t4&gt; what do you foresee for the future of runescape and runescape cheating?
&lt;Jacmob&gt; i never bothered to obsolete scripting since i liked that people were able to work on scripts
&lt;Mopman&gt; _^_: except the people who played rsc, are right
&lt;Jacmob&gt; and agreed to pay out 60% otherwise the quality would have been even worse
&lt;_^_&gt; Mopman: suck on a live grenade
&lt;Jacmob&gt; then there were legal things
&lt;Mopman&gt; :P
&lt;SeanWT&gt; _^_ well I dont believe ive ever known anyone who loved rs2 but I quit the scene after the change and barely had anything to do when doign rs2
&lt;Jacmob&gt; preparing for jagex issues, i&#39;m still suing paris
&lt;SeanWT&gt; but you have a point 
&lt;SeanWT&gt; but I just hated the pking system in rs2
&lt;Mopman&gt; Jacmob: youre suing paris? i didnt even fuckin know that
&lt;Mopman&gt; haha
&lt;Mopman&gt; what for
&lt;Jacmob&gt; rsbuddy&#39;s hosting is ridiculous
&lt;_^_&gt; paris as in the city
&lt;_^_&gt; or
&lt;SeanWT&gt; i thought the engine was neat and wrote a bot for it
&lt;_^_&gt; a person called paris
&lt;Mopman&gt; no paris as in the guy
&lt;Mopman&gt; duh
&lt;Jacmob&gt; we have anycast dns routing to 5 datacenters
&lt;_^_&gt; WHAT GUY
&lt;ramen&gt; ins3
&lt;Cbot&gt; _^_: ins3 if you know him
&lt;_^_&gt; seen around, don&#39;t know
&lt;Mopman&gt; rsbot
&lt;Cbot&gt; that guy that took over speljohan&#39;s bot
&lt;t4&gt; Jacmob: what do you foresee for the future of runescape and runescape cheating?
&lt;_^_&gt; Speljohan_ made a bot ??
&lt;Jacmob&gt; yea the ass hole who does actually want max cash
&lt;ramen&gt; THE FUTURE IS BLEAK
&lt;Mopman&gt; _^_: srsly?
&lt;_^_&gt; that wasn&#39;t a 1% completed load of fuck
&lt;_^_&gt; ?
&lt;Cbot&gt; hes trolling
&lt;_^_&gt; am not
&lt;_^_&gt; unless you mean
&lt;SeanWT&gt; rsc pking was basically like flipping a coin, yet it was incredibly fun and intense, when I played rs2 the wildy was a clusterfuck though I know they later removed it.... which sounded even worse
&lt;Mopman&gt; johan made rsbot originally..
&lt;_^_&gt; the thing that zerofreeze commissioned
&lt;Jacmob&gt; well t4 i expect runescape cheating to end and runescape to change its gameplay
&lt;Mopman&gt; no
&lt;_^_&gt; ohh
&lt;Cbot&gt; omg
&lt;_^_&gt; right
&lt;_^_&gt; ok
&lt;Mopman&gt; that was after
&lt;Cbot&gt; not zetabot lol
&lt;_^_&gt; yeah zetabot
&lt;_^_&gt; not zetabot
&lt;Mopman&gt; zetabot was a POS
&lt;Cbot&gt; I still have the source for it
&lt;Mopman&gt; there i said it
&lt;Cbot&gt; somewhere
&lt;Mopman&gt; dont hurt me 
&lt;Cbot&gt; it was good for the 3 days it was up
&lt;_^_&gt; it is truley amazing
&lt;ramen&gt; Mopman, POS?
&lt;Jacmob&gt; im happy to sue paris since he&#39;s been an ass hole to plenty of people
&lt;ramen&gt; point of
&lt;_^_&gt; how quickley jagex has brainwashed you into believing this is possible
&lt;Mopman&gt; Jacmob: its funny, people said that when they first started using obfuscation
&lt;Mopman&gt; and when they first broke google
&lt;Mopman&gt; etc
&lt;Mopman&gt; its never happened
&lt;_^_&gt; runescape cheating will continue as long as people play runescape on computers that aren&#39;t owned by jagex
&lt;_^_&gt; it is that simple
&lt;SeanWT&gt; indeed
&lt;Cbot&gt; or is it
&lt;Jacmob&gt; yea but this time the threshold that&#39;s being pushed is different Mopman 
&lt;Mopman&gt; this is like apolcalypse #5
&lt;Mopman&gt; Jacmob: peopel always say that, too :p
&lt;SeanWT&gt; so what
&lt;_^_&gt; well
&lt;_^_&gt; i agree with Jacmob on that last point
&lt;_^_&gt; it&#39;s a new frontier
&lt;_^_&gt; the new bot is the neural network bot
&lt;SeanWT&gt; runescape had 13 year olds who didnt know shit writing bots for runescape, look at richyt, WoW had much more intelligent people hackign away at its codebase
&lt;Jacmob&gt; fair enough, but the analysis in real terms that leads to that conclusion suggests that it really won&#39;t be worth writing the software now
&lt;_^_&gt; of course old SCAR will chug alone galliantly
&lt;SeanWT&gt; just because the threshold increases dosent mean it goes away
&lt;Jacmob&gt; this is different in that jagex really has taken loss to remove bots
&lt;_^_&gt; the most effective method
&lt;_^_&gt; is just manual mass banning
&lt;Jacmob&gt; nothing near this significant
&lt;SeanWT&gt; theyve been hacking away at their limbs for years to stop bots, random events was meant to be the bot killer of rs2 
&lt;SeanWT&gt; people will adapat
&lt;Jacmob&gt; is that a joke
&lt;_^_&gt; well
&lt;_^_&gt; ok
&lt;_^_&gt; seriously
&lt;_^_&gt; there is no point in having this debate
&lt;_^_&gt; let me just say this to Jacmob
&lt;Jacmob&gt; you can&#39;t seriously say that jagex have been working their limbs off to stop botting
&lt;_^_&gt; in what i hope represents the aggregate sentiment of the cheating community
&lt;_^_&gt; after this update
&lt;Mopman&gt; in the past thye have
&lt;_^_&gt; :
&lt;Mopman&gt; they go through phases
&lt;_^_&gt; bring it on
&lt;_^_&gt; &quot;
&lt;Mopman&gt; of being very passive and very active
&lt;SeanWT&gt; hacking their limbs off by destroying their game in attempts to stop botting
&lt;SeanWT&gt; not working their limbs off
&lt;SeanWT&gt; is what I meant
&lt;SeanWT&gt; and they have
&lt;SeanWT&gt; I know jagex take drastic measures
&lt;Jacmob&gt; and you can only argue either way with quantitative data
&lt;SeanWT&gt; I often feel to their detrament
&lt;SeanWT&gt; as far as gameplay is concerned
&lt;Jacmob&gt; which i can&#39;t relate so we&#39;ll have to wait and see
&lt;Mopman&gt; at least this update didnt detrimentally affect gameplay
&lt;_^_&gt; heh
&lt;SeanWT&gt; Mopman other than performance
&lt;Mopman&gt; performance of the client, sure, but the game itself stayed
&lt;_^_&gt; +1 Mopman
&lt;SeanWT&gt; and removing the unsigned client apparently
&lt;Jacmob&gt; this update isnt finished
&lt;Jacmob&gt; this update is actually quite far from finished
&lt;Mopman&gt; haha
&lt;Mopman&gt; care to share
&lt;Mopman&gt; :&gt;:&gt;
&lt;SeanWT&gt; the boogey man wants you scared
&lt;SeanWT&gt; DONT LOOK UNDER THE BED KIDS
&lt;Jacmob&gt; in fact what&#39;s happend so far is overhyped and mediocre
&lt;SeanWT&gt; id agree with that
&lt;Mopman&gt; ive been trying to underhype it and people keep telling me im naive
&lt;Mopman&gt; so i can only assume theres more to it than ive seen
&lt;_^_&gt; Jacmob, what realistic measures can their be against screenreading bots
&lt;Jacmob&gt; the new obfuscation is a good basis to make analysis a bigger pain
&lt;SeanWT&gt; I said it from the day of the patch that &quot;this isnt it&quot;
&lt;Mopman&gt; _^_: screenreading as in scar?
&lt;_^_&gt; there be (
&lt;_^_&gt; wow
&lt;Jacmob&gt; but in and of itself isnt much
&lt;Mopman&gt; well simba*
&lt;_^_&gt; i type like a retard
&lt;SeanWT&gt; there may be a lul
&lt;SeanWT&gt; but it will end 
&lt;Mopman&gt; tough
&lt;Mopman&gt; whos gonna end it
&lt;Mopman&gt; atm
&lt;Mopman&gt; i have no idea
&lt;SeanWT&gt; frank prolly
&lt;SeanWT&gt; :P
&lt;Mopman&gt; hahaha
&lt;_^_&gt; frank is a lazy bag
&lt;Mopman&gt; frank could
&lt;Mopman&gt; but he wont
&lt;_^_&gt; he is too lazy
&lt;_^_&gt; he&#39;s old and fat and bald
&lt;SeanWT&gt; franks smart enough to do it if mopar dips into his fund
&lt;Mopman&gt; mopar will dip into his fund
&lt;_^_&gt; his spry youth is a distant memory in the rearview mirror of the sunset
&lt;Mopman&gt; i shouldnt be promising things on behalf of mopar
&lt;Mopman&gt; but
&lt;Mopman&gt; fuck it
&lt;Mopman&gt; he would
[/code]

[code]
&lt;Mopman&gt; does anyone knwo whya ndrew left btw
&lt;_^_&gt; or something
&lt;Mopman&gt; it seemed
&lt;SeanWT&gt; that just makes it look faggy
&lt;Mopman&gt; like
&lt;Mopman&gt; bad
&lt;Mopman&gt; like somethign went down
&lt;SeanWT&gt; Mopman because he was rich?
&lt;Mopman&gt; dramaz
&lt;Mopman&gt; nah it seemd way more than that
&lt;Jacmob&gt; no Mopman hes still there
&lt;Jacmob&gt; thats just a rumour
&lt;Mopman&gt; Jacmob: define &quot;there&quot;
&lt;_^_&gt; and the fact that andrew is worth 300mill whatever the british currency is
&lt;_^_&gt; ?
* SeanWT slaps eXemplar around a bit with a large dildo
&lt;Mopman&gt; he no longer holds any shares and has formed another studio
&lt;Jacmob&gt; in the office frequently
&lt;Mopman&gt; that seems like hes left to me
&lt;Mopman&gt; oh hes still around
&lt;Mopman&gt; ok
[/code]

something obvious:
[code]&lt;Jacmob&gt; jagex were going to take down rsbuddy at some point if i hadn&#39;t decided to stop it
[/code]


[code]
&lt;Jacmob&gt; i dont trust jagex to do more than stop botting for a few weeks, but i trust myself to do it
&lt;Jacmob&gt; of course it&#39;s very easy for me to trust myself
&lt;unhandled&gt; http://franklyfrank.info/quote/10
&lt;SeanWT&gt; well if anyones going to trust you, it would be yourself
&lt;Mopman&gt; eXemplar: are you writing it in ruby
&lt;SeanWT&gt; I dont
&lt;eXemplar&gt; no, because i&#39;m not gay
&lt;Mopman&gt; lol
&lt;eXemplar&gt; hey Mopman, hows the mod tracker
&lt;Mopman&gt; fuck ya then
&lt;Mopman&gt; eXemplar: haha
&lt;Mopman&gt; i got lazy :(
&lt;SeanWT&gt; eXemplar you make me love you more everyday
&lt;Mopman&gt; i mean
&lt;Mopman&gt; i had other things
&lt;Mopman&gt; to do
&lt;eXemplar&gt; yes, you are clearly a man with a lot on his plate :P
&lt;Mopman&gt; 22:55:08        Jacmob | i dont trust jagex to do more than stop botting for a few weeks, but i trust myself to do it
&lt;Mopman&gt; so is your role at jagex going to be anti cheat focused
&lt;SeanWT&gt; eXemplar why arent you asking about his 3d space game with seemless planteary flying
&lt;Jacmob&gt; no Mopman 
&lt;Mopman&gt; he didnt know about that
&lt;Mopman&gt; stfu 
&lt;Mopman&gt; ok
&lt;SeanWT&gt; or his html5 turned java game
&lt;eXemplar&gt; SeanWT: go on?
&lt;Jacmob&gt; but i still have a feeling

&lt;frank_&gt; hacked one*
&lt;frank_&gt; super_, is this what they use instead of instanceof? http://pastebin.com/n7CWawDd
&lt;super_&gt; if its like
&lt;lawl&gt; its illegal in ur state
&lt;Mopman&gt; lol some of the quote on these cryptocgrams
&lt;super_&gt; aload dup ifnonnull arraylength bipush if_icmpeq
&lt;Mopman&gt; make me think im doing it wrong
&lt;super_&gt; if its like that
&lt;Mopman&gt; because the phrase makes no sense
&lt;super_&gt; then yes
&lt;Mopman&gt; then it does
&lt;Mopman&gt; "since when is public safety the root password to the constitution"
&lt;Mopman&gt; i had root password and saw constitution and was like...wat
&lt;Mopman&gt; guys can we start ruining another game
&lt;Mopman&gt; rs is no fun now and theye wrecked their own performance anyway
&lt;Mopman&gt; thsi is a win
&lt;frank_&gt; runescape too hard for you?
&lt;Mopman&gt; yes
&lt;Mopman&gt; yes it is
&lt;frank_&gt; someone should write a bot so they get the fucking message to stop making it so grindy
&lt;Mopman&gt; or they just do something else annoying asn dtime consuming nad gay
&lt;Mopman&gt; FACE IT THEY WON
&lt;Mopman&gt; even you cant be btohered anymore
&lt;frank_&gt; rong
&lt;lawl&gt; lol i was showing my mom voice recognition on phone
&lt;lawl&gt; so i said 'send photo' or some shit
&lt;frank_&gt; i couldnt be bothered when noobs like jacmob were in control
&lt;lawl&gt; and it wrote 'some f***'
&lt;lawl&gt; i wasl iek wtf
&lt;Mopman&gt; thats y ur deobfuscator is coming along swimmingly i assume :P
&lt;lawl&gt; it wrote the *'s tho
&lt;frank_&gt; tbh, for the most part it works fine
&lt;t4&gt; frank_: they hire people like Jacmob but not you? :(
&lt;Mopman&gt; we dont know jacmob is hired 
&lt;Mopman&gt; he could well just be bullshitting
&lt;frank_&gt; how old is jacmob?
&lt;t4&gt; i guess
&lt;t4&gt; frank_: 17 or 18
&lt;Mopman&gt; especially since apparently he said "back from runefest" on the day is started
&lt;Mopman&gt; it*
&lt;frank_&gt; then no, he hasnt been hired
&lt;frank_&gt; he probably got accepted to oxbridge or something
&lt;Mopman&gt; he said hes goign to cambridge
&lt;t4&gt; frank_: what makes you conclude this
&lt;frank_&gt; iirc jagex do work exp from cambridge
&lt;Mopman&gt; they do work experience from like
&lt;Mopman&gt; all the big unis
&lt;Mopman&gt; they always have stalls at the sandwich recruitment shits
&lt;Mopman&gt; for example they were in leeds
&lt;Mopman&gt; and thats nowhere near cambrdige
&lt;frank_&gt; who the fuck would give up the intellectual challenge if they were in his position?
&lt;Mopman&gt; lul
* jme has quit (Ping timeout)
&lt;t4&gt; frank_: maybe he got some big buckeroos from jagex
&lt;Mopman&gt; its possible that jagex offfered him a sandwich placement i guess
&lt;Mopman&gt; on his uni course
&lt;frank_&gt; why would they hire him when they can scare him away with lawyers
&lt;Mopman&gt; "hey kid, when youre doing your placement, ill put in a good word for you"
&lt;Mopman&gt; "IF you stop what youre doing"
&lt;Mopman&gt; "wink wink"
&lt;lawl&gt; np: Mezzoforte - Hard Wired [00:13 of 04:43] [987kbps]
&lt;frank_&gt; what does he mean when he took rsbuddy to runefest?
&lt;lawl&gt; :O
&lt;super_&gt; frank_, 
&lt;frank_&gt; he had it on a thumb drive in his pocket?
&lt;super_&gt; he fixed it
&lt;t4&gt; frank_: flash drive
&lt;Mopman&gt; frank_: afaict he meant he took a working update to runefest and showed them
&lt;super_&gt; after the update
&lt;t4&gt; and showed them, frank_ 
&lt;super_&gt; and went to runefest
&lt;super_&gt; and showed it to thed evs
&lt;super_&gt; or something
&lt;frank_&gt; proof plos
&lt;Mopman&gt; i dont find that so hard to believe tbh
&lt;t4&gt; HEY GUISE LOCK ME UP RITE NOW
&lt;t4&gt; LOOK WHAT I DID LOL
&lt;Mopman&gt;  ya cuz its totally criminal to write rs bots
&lt;t4&gt; Mopman: over exaggeration 
&lt;Shawnjohnsj&gt; he took it on a flash drive and set it up on their dedicated PCs to play RS
&lt;Mopman&gt; ino :p
&lt;Mopman&gt; then he swung in from a rope
&lt;Mopman&gt; screaming FREEDOMMM
&lt;frank_&gt; as if jagex let you run shit on their pcs
&lt;Mopman&gt; and killed gower
&lt;t4&gt; idk i kinda agree with frank_ 
&lt;Mopman&gt; frank_: well we could have found out last year
&lt;ramen&gt; i run rsbuddy let me show you it
&lt;t4&gt; he seems like an intelligent guy
&lt;Mopman&gt; but you were too muc hof a pussy
&lt;frank_&gt; hah
&lt;Mopman&gt; and persuaded me not to do it
&lt;t4&gt; but the odds of a company
&lt;t4&gt; rolling out the red carpet 
&lt;t4&gt; for HIM
&lt;frank_&gt; like you were going to go anyway
&lt;t4&gt; doubtful
&lt;Mopman&gt; i srsly wanted to try that
&lt;Mopman&gt; but you
&lt;Mopman&gt; scared me
&lt;Mopman&gt; probably rightly
&lt;ramen&gt; t4 id imagine thats possible in real life
&lt;ramen&gt; they have no internets to hide behind
&lt;frank_&gt; if you were going to do anything, you should hand out business cards
&lt;Mopman&gt; i was going to hand out zetabot
&lt;Mopman&gt; on cd
&lt;t4&gt; frank_: have u read
&lt;t4&gt; https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,523421.msg3806973.html#msg3806973
&lt;Mopman&gt; but
&lt;Mopman&gt; i got the updater
&lt;Mopman&gt; looked at it and went
&lt;Mopman&gt; I AM NOT FIXING THAT
&lt;t4&gt; might give you insight to the claims
&lt;frank_&gt; yes
&lt;t4&gt; kk
&lt;frank_&gt; i didnt read it all cus i have a low tolerance to bullshit
&lt;Mopman&gt; haha
&lt;Mopman&gt; is this why you dont talk to me much anymore
&lt;Mopman&gt; makes sense
&lt;Mopman&gt; oh wait no thats the wow addiction
&lt;t4&gt; frank_: what you think really happened then?
&lt;Budda&gt; The topic or board you are looking for appears to be either missing or off limits to you.
&lt;frank_&gt; he put it in his "too hard" basket
&lt;t4&gt; kind of a stupid move
&lt;frank_&gt; botting didnt ruin the game
&lt;Mopman&gt; i still think its likely that they made some flippant comment about him doing placement there
&lt;frank_&gt; their grind design did
&lt;Mopman&gt; and he got excited and didnt want to ruin it
&lt;Mopman&gt; its a cheap way to stop him while possibly getting a reasonably proficient guy to do a placement
&lt;Mopman&gt; he is here, btw
&lt;Mopman&gt; while we sit talking abotu him
&lt;Mopman&gt; haha
&lt;frank_&gt; who cares
&lt;t4&gt; he's most likely asleep anyway
&lt;frank_&gt; if jagex offered me a job id take it, but i wouldnt stop what i was doing until i got my first pay cheque
&lt;Mopman&gt; he still plans to go to uni, from waht i gahtered
&lt;Mopman&gt; so its not like its a full time job nomsain
&lt;Mopman&gt; and them hiring him as some kind of secret anti cheat dev guy seems too far fetched to me
&lt;frank_&gt; they dont need an anti cheat guy
&lt;frank_&gt; they are doing fine
&lt;Mopman&gt; well yeah exactly</code></pre>
<p>frank_ and his wisdom</p>

<blockquote>15:54:42 &lt; Jacmob&gt; i would rather have gameplay changes
15:55:02 &lt; Wizzup&gt; jagex won't go after colour bots
15:55:06 &lt;@sppt&gt; hehehe
15:55:09 &lt; Wizzup&gt; they're such a minority and not breakable
15:55:17 &lt; Wizzup&gt; They'll ``break'' them anyway with their normal updates
15:55:19 &lt;+vortex&gt; i'd rather not play runescape
15:55:22 &lt;@sppt&gt; too bad jagex doesnt seem to realise what the reason is behind people botting
15:55:23 &lt;+vortex&gt; o i haven't played for years
15:55:24 &lt;@sppt&gt; such a shame
15:55:27 &lt; P&gt; vortex, ++
15:55:33 &lt; Jacmob&gt; thats not quite true Wizzup there are things that may be done
15:55:38 &lt; Jacmob&gt; but ya its not a huge priority
15:55:42 &lt; Wizzup&gt; Such as, Project: ACID RUNESCAPE?
15:55:48 &lt; Wizzup&gt; or, RUNESCAPE FOR BLIND
15:55:53 &lt; P&gt; just make the xp rate 1000 nobody would fucking bot anyways!
15:55:58 &lt; Niall&gt; sppt: come play lotro with me gayslave yohan and rowan
15:56:02 &lt; Wizzup&gt; The only thing that really got colour bots before, they removed
15:56:06 &lt; Wizzup&gt; The Ent for example
15:56:07 &lt;@sppt&gt; lotro lollllllllllllll
15:56:09 &lt; Wizzup&gt; or Gas on rocks
15:56:12 &lt; Wizzup&gt; evil chicken
15:56:15 &lt; Wizzup&gt; They removed it all
15:56:17 &lt; Wizzup&gt; silly jagex
15:56:24 &lt;@sppt&gt; yes, because its annoying as shit Wizzup 
15:56:32 &lt; Wizzup&gt; well, then they won't get colour bots
15:56:36 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; jaccy babe how you doin sexy
15:56:59 &lt; Jacmob&gt; there are other ways to break them, but again, i dont think that should be a priority
15:57:04 &lt; Rictoo_&gt;  too bad jagex doesnt seem to realise what the reason is behind people botting
15:57:05 &lt; Jacmob&gt; simply because the gameplay needs changing anyway
15:57:11 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; majority are chinese gold farmers, iirc
15:57:13 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; so: money?
15:57:48 &lt;@sppt&gt; why would there be a market for gold farmers and RWT in general, Rictoo_ ?
15:57:55 &lt; Wizzup&gt; Jacmob: Name them
15:57:59 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; no, its not cuz game is boring sppt
15:58:03 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; all mmorpgs have gold farmers
15:58:04 &lt; Wizzup&gt; How will you break a bot that acts exactly like normal playeras
15:58:10 &lt; Wizzup&gt; By LOOKING at the screen
15:58:13 -!- ytuio9` [~ytuio9@OVER.9000] has joined #mopar
15:58:19 &lt; Wizzup&gt; You can't make a ``clusterflutter'' on the screen
15:58:22 &lt;@sppt&gt; yes, but runescape is quite an extreme if you ask me Rictoo_ 
15:58:25 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; captchas
15:58:26 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; sleepwalker
15:58:27 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; dyl0ck
15:58:28 &lt;@sppt&gt; all it is is a glorified MUD
15:58:36 &lt; Wizzup&gt; reCaptcha came to mind yes
15:58:38 &lt; ytuio9`&gt; i reported u 2 mitb :)
15:58:41 &lt; Jacmob&gt; the bayesian anti-deformational priori flutterer
15:58:45 &lt; ytuio9`&gt; i hope ur account gets banned u fucking bitch :)
15:58:46 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; Wizzup, they used to have that
15:58:53 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; but rscn got past it :p
15:59:00 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; with cold feet or w/e the fuck it was called
15:59:06 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; sleepwalker maybe
15:59:22 &lt; antiyou&gt; sleepwalker indeed
15:59:36 &lt; antiyou&gt; hey Rictoo_ 
15:59:37 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; good times
15:59:43 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; sup antiyou hows life treating you
15:59:54 &lt; antiyou&gt; still kickin
15:59:56 &lt; antiyou&gt; :P
16:00:03 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; cool
16:00:08 &lt; bootnecklad&gt; hai antiyou 
16:00:13 &lt; antiyou&gt; hey booty
16:01:09 &lt; ytuio9`&gt; wtf i thought this was #rscode...
16:01:19 &lt; antiyou&gt; its not so gtfo
16:01:46 &lt; ytuio9`&gt; hey bro u think ur cool?
16:01:47 &lt; ytuio9`&gt; do u m8?
16:01:56 &lt; ytuio9`&gt; iĺl fkn 108 a cap in ur ass
16:02:18 &lt; Rictoo_&gt; you accidentally an ascii char
16:02:25 &lt; Wizzup&gt; Jacmob: I assume that is a ``I don't know''?
16:03:06 &lt; Jacmob&gt; there are a couple of things that that i cant mention but are pretty obvious
16:03:11 &lt; Jacmob&gt; one that
16:04:03 &lt; Wizzup&gt; Are you implying they'd hire someone who has been ruining their game
16:04:09 &lt; Wizzup&gt; I don't believe that crap
16:04:24 &lt; Wizzup&gt; If someone who'd ruin my game came at my door, I'd kick him out and file a lawsuit
16:04:26 &lt; Wizzup&gt; not hire him
16:04:55 &lt; Wizzup&gt; The same happened to kaitnieks
16:05:07 &lt; Wizzup&gt; made a deal, got instabanned, then he made scar
16:06:25 &lt; Wizzup&gt; so I don't buy it ;) 
16:06:36 &lt; eXemplar&gt; me either
16:06:45 &lt; Jacmob&gt; im not trying to sell anything; i really dont care either way
16:06:45 &lt; eXemplar&gt; but either way, it doesn't affect me in the slightest, so i also don't care
