    <description>I am trying to make a voting system for my server where if they vote they go tell an admin+ then an admin does a command like
[code]::givevote +playername+[/code]
so then after that command it disconnects the player and sets the vote in the player log to 1 so then when the player logges back in he can now do the command
[code]::votereward[/code]
after that command it opens the interface 8207 and then he has an option of 4 different rewards:
[code]Option 1: 20mill
Option 2: Masters wand
Option 3: (Barrows set then Opens up another 8207 interface that give the choice of these barrows sets
(Option 3: Option 1: Karils set)
(Option 3: Option 2: Ahrims set)
(Option 3: Option 3: Torags set)
(Option 3: Option 4: Guthans set))
Back to the initial set of options
Option 4: 10 Pest Control Points that then disconnects the player and adds 10 points to his/her Pest control in the player log.[/code]
After selecting any of these options it sets the vote in the players log to 0
If they do not enter the command to use the vote and they vote again the total votes then build up until they choose to spend them.

If anyone would be able to do this for a 317 Delta (Ddsspeced) source please help me!! because atm this is my command for when players get votes...
[code]            if (command.startsWith(&quot;vote&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 1) {
                try {
                    String otherPName = command.substring(5);
                    int otherPIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(otherPName);
                    if (otherPIndex != -1) {
                        client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];
			p.addItem(995, 20000000);
                	p.disconnected = true;
			p.sM(&quot;You now have A Vote Reward!!!&quot;);
			sM(&quot;You have given &quot;+p.playerName+&quot; A Vote Reward.&quot;);
                    } else { 
                       sM(&quot;The name doesnt exist.&quot;); 
                    }
                } catch (Exception e) { 
                    sM(&quot;Try entering a name you want to give a vote reward to...&quot;);
                }
            }[/code]
