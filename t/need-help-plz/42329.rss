    <description> :|   Next, you will need to open ports in Windows Firewall and/or the firewalls offered by McAffee, Norton, or other full-system maintenance suites.  For Windows Firewall, open its settings file in the control panel.  Click on the &quot;Exceptions Tab&quot; and then click &quot;Add Port.&quot;  Add the following port: 43594.  (If you&#39;d rather not open a specific port or have to worry about Windows Firewall disabling access in any way, you can disable it entirely.)

but i dont have firewall icons in panel control

Now we will need to make the rule for your router, by doing this you need to go into your router. You can do this by going into Internet Explorer (or whatever client you use for the Internet), and then type in the IP address of the router. Now log into the router and go into &quot;advanced&quot; (at top of screen on mine). Then on the sidebar to the left click the &quot;gaming&quot; button (is only left side for me...) Then you need to make a new rule and fill in the blanks with this information:

Name: 1
IP address: 2
TCP Ports to open: 43594
UDP Ports to open:
Inbound Filter: Allow All
Schedule: Always


PLZ SOME 1 CAN SHOW ME THE EASIER WAY TO DO IT ((( WITH A PICTURE ITS WILL BE BETTER FOR ME CUZ IM NOT VERY GOOD IN ENGLISH )))</description>

<p>I don’t think you can put a port in norton.delete norton if you have it,but I use my server with it on and its fine.</p>
