[size=14pt]Have you ever just sat back and though about how lucky u were just to have Moparscape to teach you all these great things and expand your mind? Well I did for the last 2 days and now im going to start a project that will be released for all of the Moparscapians So everyone has something to start on. I want to make this server perfect, so basically i&#39;m never going to stop working.

I would love to have everyone post what they want to see in the server and any Ideas for new areas. Ill be doing all the work and im kinda new to coding so PLEASE no hateful comments, i&#39;m just trying to be a part of Moparscape.[/size]

[size=14pt]Updates
Anti Syi added
Fixed Gfx on Bando&#39;s Godsword
Added healing to the Saradomin Godsword
Made a fast auto saver, still trying to find out what time to save it at. (set to 30 seconds and logout)
Added Mapdata for the Bounty hunter area, Picture coming as soon as its stable.

Updates soon to come
--- Dart throwing 35% Projectiles added, stackable dragon darts added,(still need the animations for throwing)
--- Skill cape emotes 95% (having problems with the gfx&#39;s loading at the right times, take about a week for all)
--- New punching 50% (All works fine, I just need to aply it.)
