    <title>Members getting PKed in non-pking area - edgeville (World - 111)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/members-getting-pked-in-non-pking-area-edgeville-world-111/3639</link>
    <description>Apparently there has been either a massive hack, or a massive bug. People were getting PKed in edgeville world 111 earlier in non-pking areas. Tons of valuables were lost in this bug/hack (E.X : Full dragon, whips, mask sets, money) It has the whiff of a hack because there was a huge line of people following one guy asking &quot;Is this falador?&quot; With no spelling errors. But MEH. When a friend told me about this - either he&#39;s lying or I died laughing for a reason. He said he&#39;ll send me pictures.

              <p>durial has been banned/locked and the bug has been fixed. basically, you can att other players in the dungeon of a house. but if the owner kicks you out, you can still attack other ppl any time anywhere.<br>
so its useless begging for the bug now, it no longer exists.</p>

<p>and also they can give use back our shit(thats why private servers can do the item spawning) but they are really lazy and besides letting people have free stuff becasue they submitted the wrong thing and jagex failed to check up properly, now we just get to sit back and laugh at the newbs that lost good stuff, the mod said BANK, but you walk around saying kill me</p>

              <p>Paul said on the forums:</p>
<blockquote>Hi, 
thought I'd respond to rants about a bug we had last night where some people managed to go playerkilling outside of the wilderness. 
Development staff got out of bed in the middle of the night to sort things as quickly as possible, but I apologise for this inconvenience that will have been caused to a number of our users. 
We do have a testing team who did spend a lot of time testing this update, but the update had so much content I guess it wasn't that unlikely we'd not think of every way to break every feature and that something would sneak through. 
<p>That is not an excuse to be lax on things on my part, we are obviosuly unhappy that sort of bug occured and certainly wouldn’t want a repeat of it.<br>
We are learning from this and are making improvements to our testing and coding procedures so that this sort of bug will be less likely to occur.</p>
<p>I would like to take this oppurtunity to point out that bug abuse is against the rules of our game, especially something as serious as this and people involved with this one have their accounts disabled now.</p>
<p>I wish it was possible to refund items people have lost, but it’s just too hard to tell who really has lost stuff, there would be too many false claims to handle - as it is I can see people claiming they have lost stuff that weren’t even online at the time.<br>
The people making up stories make it seem like more people have been adversly affected by bugs than actually is the case</p>
<p>In terms of rollbacks, they’re pretty tricky things for us to do technically and it’s certainly too long ago to consider now as it would majorly set people back an awful lot of game play time. Thousands and thousands more people than were affected by the bug.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that we cannot unfortunatly allow people to link to other sites, those are standard forum rules and always have been and not related to this incident - this is NOT us covering things up - but more that we cannot be sure that certain of the security of other sites and that things won’t contain keyloggers.</p>
