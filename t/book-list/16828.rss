<p>Sadly, more kids and adults do not read books. Oh well, they don’t know what they’re missing. Here is one of my favorites.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Book:</span> Sword in the Storm<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Author:</span> David Gemmell - Former Bouncer lol.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Description:</span> [i]"Fierce and proud, the Rigante dwell deep in the green mountain lands, worshiping the gods of air and water, and the spirits of the earth.  Among them lives a warrior who bears the mark of fate. Born of the storm that slew his father, he is Connavar, and tales of his courage spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>The Seidh–a magical race as old as time–take note of the young warrior and cast a malignant shadow across his life. For soon a merciless army will cross the water, destroying forever the timeless rhythms of life among the Rigante.</p>
<p>Swearing to protect his people, Connavar embarks on a quest that will take him into the heart of the enemy. Along the way, he receives a gift: a sword as powerful and deadly as the Seidh who forged it. Thus he receives a name that will strike fear into the hearts of friend and foe alike–a name proclaiming a glorious and bitter destiny . . ."[/i]</p>
<p>Amazonia, Amazon, Slipt, Godfather, Transal Saga, … so many lol. I wish they made movies out of the good books like they used to, instead they make remakes. Graah. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
