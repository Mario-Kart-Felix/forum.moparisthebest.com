    <description>i have a server that i really want to get online. my computer says my default gateway is 192.168.0.1 but i cant put that in for port forwarding. i have a router/modem from westell. my provider is verizon so i dont go to a westell page when i type in 192.168.0.1 so portforward.com is no help at all. i would also like to add music to the client so when it starts it plays my music instead of the crappy music it came with. my client is cody&#39;s client v2 meant to work with cody scape. another thing is that in some towns i have these, i dont even know what to call them. theyre like these weird loking things that surround the east bank in varrock and some other buildings. how do i get rid of these? another thing. jad is set to drop fire capes. he drops 1 coin everytime. why? also, since my server is a 508+ is it possible to add like saradomin swords because i have saradomin godsword and things but no saradomin sword. i would also like to add dragon platebody but if 508+ servers cannot handle these items i understand. i have played 508+ servers with working sara swords though. also, do i just need to port forward 43594 or do i need to port trigger it as well. and is a port forward for no-ip necessary? i really want to get it up and running once i fix the bugs but since i cant figure out how to do the port forwarding and have it work i cant. HELP...</description>
