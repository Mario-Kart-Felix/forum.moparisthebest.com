              <p>They wouldn’t have that in there because this is not a absolute famous game, and no one plays hamachi anymore because some people don’t trust the program. And go into control panel&gt;network connections&gt;local area connection&gt;support.</p>
<p>Then were it says “default gateway:” thats your ip, type that in the address bar in mozilla firefox or internet explorer and it should tell you are kind of default gateway, then find your gateway kind for example 2700Hg or somthing like that <a href="http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> Scroll down to find it. Then look at the tutorial and it will tell you, if you cant understand it, don’t even try to portforward…  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
