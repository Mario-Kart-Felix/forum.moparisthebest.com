    <title>[PI]Rebellion - 1 Year+ Work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-rebellion-1-year-work/474577</link>
    <description>So someone keylogged me by asking me for help and
sent me to a website that bugged my pc.
He stole my work, therefor
I am going to release it so everyone knows when they
see my content, I created it. -.- Also i dont want people
being tricked into paying for my work to some douche.
 A lot of custom work of mine(NOT custom items),
90% Prestige System, A lot of Re-Written skills,
a lot of bug fixes/dupe patches. My combat is far from perfect, we
are mainly a pvm, and skilling eco server, so i did not put a huge
amount of work into combat.

The kids skype is: so.fishy &lt;DO NOT TRUST.

“I want people to stop using notepad++ and actually know what they’re doing”  Not trying to shove words in your mouth or anything, it’s just that you were starting to sound like some of the fags from R-S that basically say if you don’t use Hyperion and Eclipse then you’re basically worthless.<br>

If you want to try and say notepad++ is a better than eclipse for developing java, then you should really remember to take your pills in the morning. You obviously have something against people originating from Rune-Server, so that is a personal problem, don’t take out your frustration on me asking people to stop using notepad++ for server development.[/quote]</p>

<p>Are you implying that people who use Notepad++ don’t know what they’re doing?  I use it a decent amount and know what I’m doing for the most part, I only use IDEs when writing brand new, large content, like a minigame or a quest, but otherwise I do everything else in Notepad++<br>

And how did i imply that? o.o<br>
An IDE will compile for you, show errors for you, making it easier/faster to develop content which increases efficiency. Of course i do basic edits inside notepad++ because honestly sometimes its too much of a hassle to open up eclipse and wait for it to load up, but when i do a whole session, i use eclipse.[/quote]<br>
