<p>Shut the love up fame, all you’ve done here is negatively reflect anyone who has anything to do with running a private rsc server project. Your own lack of self esteem towards someone who is trying to help everyone else out, if they’re looking for a server similar to something of this nature, is reflected poorly upon you if someone smart were to take the time to realize. If you think their passwords are susceptible to hacking then maybe warning them of the instance, instead of flaming the OP server admin, would probably be the more mature course of action. Anyone even considering this server has a lack of what this man has to offer them.  You might go far some day if you notice your own ignorance in the course of your accusations. Just be aware, for future reference, you might be able to code a server of a dying game, you might even be able to brag about it to everyone who has no idea, but in the end you’re still just a nobody talking about nothing anyone cares about so much to even quote you at the dinner table to themselves.</p>
<p>On Topic: I think this idea has been stretched out a thousand times, by people more capable than yourself, Matt. Maybe by condensing your own skill set with others and to maybe sacrifice more than you’re willing to do so, you can probably find a solution to “our” dying rsc private server situation. Not to say that you aren’t trying, but i think it’s going to take more than what you’re offering as a supplementary solution to the needs of the few who actually give a love.</p>
<p>Good luck tho.[/quote]It’s funny how you don’t even know how to use half the words in your post, let alone what they mean. Not a single sentence in your first paragraph makes any sense.</p>

[/quote][/quote]<br>
this is coming from a first time poster hmm wonder who he is??? but i can say that when I’ve had my other servers up i never had a problem with anyone’s password being compromised or any accounts stolen.  As far as bugs I fixed most the bugs that came up while they were running, also i added several updates, fixes and new areas(different from real RSC). thanks for the concern, i’ll try my best.</p>

Agreed.</p>
<p>It is ok for the people that are judgmental to not try the server out, just don’t come on topic to bash or put people down for no reason at all… you can sit there and say oh i just wanna let people know what they are dealing with, but in reality it is just alibis to your being a negative nuisance.

<p>Also, people have the right to know that the owner of a server is incompetent to the point that he is incapable of securing their passwords.</p>
