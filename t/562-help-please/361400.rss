    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-help-please/361400</link>
    <description>I really don&#39;t know what section to post this in, mainly because someone said it&#39;s cache, someone said it&#39;s server-sided, someone said it&#39;s client-sided, i really don&#39;t know, so please don&#39;t flame. In my 562 i want to add some items in like Staff of Light, and there isn&#39;t any tutorials on it that i can find. SilentCJ&#39;s tutorial really only works for 317 so don&#39;t post a link to that, it won&#39;t help. I really wish someone would make a tut on adding items to a 562, but till then yeah. Can anyone help me out? i really want to add some items like SoL</description>
