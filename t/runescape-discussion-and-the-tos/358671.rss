    <title>RuneScape Discussion And The TOS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-discussion-and-the-tos/358671</link>
    <description>Here are the statements you have to agree to on the MoparScape TOS:

1. You are not an employee of Jagex LTD, or runescape, and are not a family member or acquaintance of the aforementioned.
2. You are not an employee of any law firm contracted with Jagex LTD, and are not a family member or acquaintance of said firm.
3. You do not currently play runescape, or any other Jagex game, and are therefore not subject to their TOS or any other agreement with them.
4. All of the information on this site is solely for learning purposes, as the main purpose of this site is to instruct people in the art of programming. All programs provided for download from this site are entirely coded by the members of this community and are not the intellectual property of any business or organization.

(Read number 3.)

Is this rule not really enforced, or outdated, or what? I see threads like &quot;Post Your Character&quot; in this forum and I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re trying to do with it, whether it&#39;s catching rule-breakers, or banning you from this site, or something else.</description>

              <p>This is to protect our accounts, If they knew we posted account info ect. and we still play they could of banned us.<br>
BUT: As casey always says, Jagex gave up on this site; They probably don’t look through it anymore.<br>
So basically it was a precaution.</p>
