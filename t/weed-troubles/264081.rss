    <description>I havn&#39;t done weed in about a year now. But I want to start again. The reason is, the first time, I was about 140 pounds and took maybe 2 hits from a bong and was okay. And it was constantly like that, another time, i was same weight took like 2-3 drags from a blunt and I would feel great, but start to get neausia (SP) and throw up like a pregnant black whore with aids. Its happened twice, I can&#39;t shake the feeling that I will get a bad high and I always think that im subconsciously making myself throw up because of the one time I did too much.

I just kept singing &quot;dude, I totally miss&quot; you by Tenacious D until I stopped vomiting in the shower and could handle getting up and sleeping. Help ftw?</description>

How about dont smoke weed<br>
[/quote]<br>
Kill yourself. Now.[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s a perfectly valid answer. Some things is not for some peoples.</p>
<p>I started getting shitty highs from weed - I stopped smoking it. Makes sense, when you think about it.</p>
<p>EDIT: If you really want to be persistant, two things it could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anxiety. The fact you said you feel you might be doing this “subconsciously” might suggest that you’re having a panic attack brought on by the feeling of coming up on weed (it’s stupidly common to link panic attacks to sensations, smells and suchlike and have those trigger them). It’s pretty unusual to panic to the point of vomiting, but it can happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low Blood Sugar. Do you have a history of blood sugar disorders like diabetes? When people “whitey” on weed (pale, trembling, sweating etc) it is often due to low blood sugar. It happens even to veteran smokers sometimes if they didn’t eat well that day or just cuz nature felt like being shitty to them. Again, not likely to cause vomiting, but I’ve passed out cold before while walking, with practically no warning whatsoever, due to low blood sugar, so hey I guess vomiting could maybe happen.</p>
</li>
</ul>

              <p>I smoke weed quite a bit and can handle quite a lot but one day not long ago I had a joint to myself and I began to have what seemed like a fit. The weird thing is that I felt like I was going to die but 5 minutes later I didn’t even feel the slightest bit stoned.</p>
<p>If you are unsure if your body can handle it then just have a little bit to start with and if you feel OK then have as much as you want.</p>
