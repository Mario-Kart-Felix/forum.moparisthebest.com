    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/all-moparscape-and-private-clients-choppy/246604</link>
    <description>Hello, i&#39;ve been searching the forums for a while and can&#39;t find answers too my problems, so im now posting this. I have downloaded moparscape client, and it worked normally for a while, but one day the screen became very choppy.  Too add to the problem, i downloaded a private servers client, donkiescape.no-ip.org and the screen is the same way.

Does anyone have any answers? I would like any suggestions. And my other problem is silab servers. When i load it, it says this:     Not Found
The requested URL /loaderror_savefile.html was not found on this server.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
