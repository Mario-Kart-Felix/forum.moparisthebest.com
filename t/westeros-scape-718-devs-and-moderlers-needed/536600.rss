Hi, I am currently looking for around 2 new developers to help me and my current developer with a project we are working on; &quot;Westeros-Scape&quot; it is based on the world of Westeros, Game of Thrones and we are trying very hard to make it a unique and fun experience, but with just two of us it is quite difficult. We are also looking for a modeler, as we need loads of new items, such as weapons, armour and other quest based items. We would also need new NPC&#39;s.


Developers:
Too apply for the developer slots you must have:
- 1 year+ experience with 718&#39;s.
- A rough understanding of Westeros or Game of Thrones.
- The ability to easily add new NPC&#39;s and quests along with general RSPS coding skills.

Desired Ability&#39;s:
- A great understanding of the lore of Westeros.
- The ability to make custom, in-house editing tools such as map editors.
- A drive to work hard.



Modelers:
Too apply for the modeler slot you must have:
- Good 3D modeling skills.
- The ability to pack models in to a cache to speed the development process.
- A rough understanding of Westeros or Game of Thrones.

Desired Ability&#39;s:
- 2 years+ of experience with 3D modeling.
- A drive to work hard.
