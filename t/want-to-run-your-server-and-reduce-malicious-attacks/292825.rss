    <title>Want to run your server and reduce malicious attacks?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/want-to-run-your-server-and-reduce-malicious-attacks/292825</link>
    <description>I can service anyone running from a linux environment, with full installation of LiteSpeed Webserver Enterprise (www.litespeedtech.com) w/CSF, and other tools for reducing multiple methods of attack. I cannot guarantee 100% uptime, as it varies from attack. If you have any questions, please post in this thread. If you&#39;re here to troll or spam, don&#39;t really care for it, so don&#39;t bother. In the future, I&#39;ll be releasing a tutorial for everyone to use, at your own discretion.

PM me for details. Mods, please PM me if this is in anyway of a violation of rules, even though more than likely you&#39;ll just delete than mute me for some bogus reason.</description>

              <p>Caching is your best bet for web servers. Wordpress users have a mod for caching their posts when Digg puts them on it’s front page. PHP accelerators work pretty well in this case too. E-accelerator is my personal favorite. I can set it to cache a couple hundred megs of PHP scripts in RAM and that helps reduce the pressure a ton. You also would need to look at your MySQL server. Most default installs only are set for at most 20 connections, others more. You can use a firewall to prevent connections to MySQL from external IP addresses and whitelist only allowed ones. A custom installation of MySQL can also be set so that it can accept upwards of about 1000 connections. I am unsure if a forum only uses a single connection to a database, same with the RSCD server, but if you find your forum being pounded by an attack, you could also set it to use a persistent connection so there will not be a flood of SYN-ACK where it connects and disconnects very rapidly which overwhelms MySQL and crashes it, along with your RSCD server.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 18, 2009, 07:58:26 pm[/size][hr]</p><blockquote>LSWS Enterprise 2-CPU Owned<br>

<p>KO9: <a href="http://forum.lighttpd.net/topic/43645" rel="nofollow noopener">http://forum.lighttpd.net/topic/43645</a> - Some reviews found. Personally, I would recommend LiteSpeed since you’re able to control more via its GUI (specifying conn. max), especially since you’re site is dependant on PHP. It’s incredibly easy to setup, even if Apache already exists, run the install script, and you’re online. PM me if you want to see the demo in the future.</p>
