</aside>
<p>Authoritarian Socialism (USSR socialism) had its flaws, but on many fields it worked, we just need to remove the bad apples. It made Russia a super power and people were better off in East-Germany than modern Germany, without being a slave to big corporations. As long as you didn’t complain or try to flee.</p>
<p>You say that theory and practice are different. Do you claim that the theory is wrong, or just hard to implement? I would say the later, and we just need to find the right way, even if that means trial and error.</p>
<p>I would not dictate exactly what the best system is, but abolishing private property is a great step in the right direction to equality.</p>
<blockquote>why are we using liberal as synonymous with liberalist - is that commonplace in other countries, because here they would mean very different things?</blockquote>
Excuse me for using the term Liberal incorrect, it just make sense for me that liberals support liberalism. If I were to translate the term we use in Norway, it would be "bourgeois", but that would include to many ideologies.
<blockquote>I don't know what problems you are talking about, but they aren't completely the fault of Liberalism. Looking at the Middle East, Liberalism is exactly the solution for their problems. A completely unregulated economy is wrong, but not every flavour of Liberalism preaches a free market.</blockquote>
I'm not saying the problem is liberalism in middle-east (Many of them have in fact a Arabic flavour of socialism). But the western world's liberalism, where we exploit workers in China and India in the name of profits. We are not able to provide decent healthcare for everyone, inhumane immigration politics, non-effective criminal care, an unstable economy, and a lot of poor people because they were unfortunate or we needed them to do the worst paid labour.
<p>The reason I think a flavour of Socialism can solve all of this is simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Removing greed from the system, and destroying the consumer culture would eliminate the reason for exploiting workers in other countries. We can afford to pay them a liveable wage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With everything in governmental control, we could have a much more effective economy and we would have no problem paying for health care.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>2b. I believe that cooperation, not competition is most effective for desired results. If the content of this article is correct: <a href="http://www.charleswarner.us/articles/competit.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.charleswarner.us/articles/competit.htm</a>, then my view has also scientific evidence.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>If kill egoism, we would not deny people who need it to live in our country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If everyone has what they need, nobody would become criminals because they fell outside society or doesn’t get what they need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the economy is under control and we abolish the credit economy we would have a much more stable economy without crisis because of some retards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>5b. Command economy has its problem when it comes to production, but that that also applies to capitalism. And command economy is more fitted to do it, when it has the necessary information and doesn’t take risks.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>If everyone get the same decent living standard, we wouldn’t have poor or rich.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not say we should let leachers leach, I would say that healthy people who deny working should get the same privileges that the rest of us.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A last thing, I ask you how much socialism you can accept, and still call it liberal? For instance I would not include social democrats in that definition.</p>

</aside>
<p>So instead of being a slave to big corporations, you’ll be a slave to the government?</p>
<p>I wouldn’t call the USSR a successful country. Looking at today’s unified Germany, it’s the East that still lacks behind the West. The former DDR is still a poor part of Germany, and a lot of the people there move to the west. And if you look at the video’s from 1989, you’ll see that everyone is happy they can go to the west. I doubt they were happy because they could spread their ideology or tell about their great Motherland.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t call the USSR a successful country. Looking at today’s unified Germany, it’s the East that still lacks behind the West. The former DDR is still a poor part of Germany, and a lot of the people there move to the west. And if you look at the video’s from 1989, you’ll see that everyone is happy they can go to the west. I doubt they were happy because they could spread their ideology or tell about their great Motherland.</p>

<p>Maybe people were happy in 1989, but this tell another story.<br>

How do you plan for a bureaucracy to have the necessary information? That's the whole point of markets i.e. decentralized approach to efficient resource allocation. You don't face the problem of ~200 government workers trying to aggregate and interpret all the information of the populus; instead, the market price mechanism effectively solves this issue autonomically. However, pragmatically, there arise some issues which result in the contemporary use of collective bargaining and decentralized economic planning.

The bureaucracy already have the system to gather necessary information. Each store registers how much is bought of each item, so we have a measure of the consume. As a government owned store would have no competition, so it would have a stable consume, and the numbers could be trusted. And the Bureau of Statistics would know at any time how many people are living in each place, so any change in population could be adjusted for.</p>
<p>The real positive sides with a more planned economy is that you could easily persuade people to take more healthy choices by lowering the price on healthy food, and it would be in the government’s interest to keep products with poor quality out of the marked.  You don’t need to close a store that is not profitable, if it serve an important service to people in small places. In some places you would need less stores, as many stores are built close to each other without it serving a real need.</p>
<p>Anyway we have a too big consume in most countries in the western world, US’ ecological footprint is four times too high and need to be lowered. The free marked would NEVER try to reduce or consume.</p>
