    <title>Importing Client Class</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/importing-client-class/376370</link>
    <description>I made a Fishing class as adding it into the object packet was a bit difficult. But obviously I have methods in there such as sendMessage and addItem. How can I import these methods without copy pasting them into the Fishing class? Thanks. Also I went ahead and made all of the classes packages. For some reason it won&#39;t recognize them though. Like for example I made all classes have at the top:
&lt;blockquote&gt;package Deob_Source.src;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That is where they are all located.
Next I added this in the Fishing class.
[code]import Deob_Source.src.Client;[/code]

Thanks for all of the help.</description>
