[b]WATCH THIS FIRST[/b]

1.) How do I get my weapons to actually strike instead of disapearing and looking like some homo trying to slap someone.

2.) How do I make it so that my custom weapons actually take up both hands, I have already put the id number in item.java under twohanded and it still didn&#39;t work.

3.) How do I get my wings to fly once I equip them.
