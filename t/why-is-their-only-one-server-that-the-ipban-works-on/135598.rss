    <title>Why is their only one server that the ipban works on?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-is-their-only-one-server-that-the-ipban-works-on/135598</link>
    <description>Does anyone no How to add a FULL working ipban, that actully blocks every single name they try.

because when I ipban someone they just do a new name and it works. this is rather pointless.

The only server I no to have full working ipban is Hybrid Isle&#39;z.

Does anyone no how to add it?

Many Thanks I James I.</description>

              <p>What your problem is is that you server dose not save a new char file then read it. It reads it and dose not find it and saves a new one and just goes. You need to make it read the char file before logging the person in. Or you can do what I do search “moreinfo file not found” or char file or w/e (normally both) and then in that code after it says it was not found add disconnected = true; it is very simple</p>

<p>For your thick skull, banning their IP address means BANNING THEIR COMPUTER. It’s always successfully worked for me.</p>
<p>I’ve got 3 computers, say you IP banned me I’d be able to use another computer to get onto yours. Maybe that’s that they’re doing?</p>

<p>um go to ‘connected…’ then find their latest name they have logged in with. then copy their ip address, go back then go into the file that says ‘data’ and find the file in data that says ‘ipbans’ paste their ip in that. then close and save changes.</p>
<p>NOTE: the server must be offline for you to ban an ip !</p>

              <p>Does anyone no How to add a FULL working ipban, that actully blocks every single name they try.</p>
<p>because when I ipban someone they just do a new name and it works. this is rather pointless.</p>
<p>The only server I no to have full working ipban is Hybrid Isle’z.</p>
<p>Does anyone no how to add it?</p>
<p>Many Thanks I James I.</p>
