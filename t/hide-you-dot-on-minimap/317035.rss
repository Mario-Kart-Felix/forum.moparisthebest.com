    <title>Hide you dot on minimap</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hide-you-dot-on-minimap/317035</link>
    <description>I was wondering if there is a way to hide your dot on the minimap. Because I made a hidden admin and did Pnpc to make him invisible so I could monitor my players (like new staff and stuff). But my dot on the minimap gives away where I am and they walk up to the dot and say is someone there and stuff. So is there anyway to make it so I could do a command or something and not have a dot on minimap</description>
