    <title>Catalyst RSC Emulator</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/catalyst-rsc-emulator/352788</link>
    <description>My latest project (had to be done some time)

Basically Catalyst is a new RSC emulator written from scratch, i know well that using RSCD can only go so far. RSCD is single threaded and when i was running with RSCA when we hit around 700 players, it was pretty much at it&#39;s peak. Lots of people who play popular servers like RSCA/RSCE usually say that the original RSC felt like it had less lag. That&#39;s because technically it did.

RSCD is not event driven and every 40-50ms it will process your data, this means your most likely going to gain an extra 40-50ping than you did with RSC. Then theres the client updater in RSCD which runs at 600ms (which means when you cast a spell, equip an item, you and others will have to wait for this next loop to come around (which could take around half a second plus the latency differences) to actually see your self doing that. This is unnecessary and the 600ms ClientUpdater isn&#39;t needed for a lot of the updates it does (it can be sped up a lot, instantly).

Overall this means theres a lot of headroom to decrease latency between the client and server.

Basically the features of this emulator and why people should use it over RSCD is:

Catalyst will be Multi-theaded (more CPU cores = more performance, RSCD would have no improvements using more than 1 core) therefore being able to hold more players and process tasks faster to keep latency lower.

Catalyst will use the Netty framework (from my little research, Netty is faster and less bloated than apache MINA)

Catalyst will be event driven and tasks will be processed instantly

Catalyst will run most of the content (skills, item/object/npc actions etc) as plugins (we will have a website for the emulator, and a plugin-dump where you can share your plugins)

Catalyst will use Python and setup so writing an NPC script, quest or other actions will be a breeze.

Catalyst will focus on optimizing tasks that RSCD didn&#39;t to ensure lowest latency possible (to feel fast to the player)


As this emulator is open source and i&#39;m writing it for you guys, not for me. i&#39;m not using this and hosting a server after this. You could say i&#39;m writing this for experience. If anyone has any alternatives to any parts of the server and can provide information on how it would be better, i&#39;ll be sure to let you, or myself implement it.

Sometime down the line i&#39;m also going to add character AI. basically i&#39;ll be able to load up 2000 &#39;fake&#39; players to be spawned all over the RSC world and run scripts, these might go mine the nearest rock, might wear armor, might talk, open doors, walk around etc. It can be used to stress out the server, and it&#39;s a cool little addition to see that many people around.


[b]This project is open source[/b]. You may find the subversion at googlecode: http://code.google.com/p/catalystrsc/

Right now i&#39;m still working on the basics, after i get multiplayer/walking etc done, ill be porting a lot of content over from RSCD and cleaning it up if it needs to be to speed this process up. I will be using all of RSCD&#39;s def/locs/formula&#39;s and other things that are not necessary to write again. Once i hit a milestone that i&#39;m aiming for, everyone will be able to help develop to make this as close as RSC as possible. It won&#39;t have any direct support for PK/point servers unless you highly modify it.

I am for an RSC clone and will continue to update this emulator patching every dupe and exploit possible. Others can help by writing plugins, NPC/object data or even drop data to get this emulator as accurate as possible.</description>
