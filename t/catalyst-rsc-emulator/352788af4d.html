<p>[code]<br>
Jagex Library<br>
Here is a list of all the features which our technology already supports:</p>
<p>2D-Graphics<br>
Scrolling background, designable by a map editor. Ideal for platform games, shoot-em-ups etc…<br>
Pixel perfect collision detection.<br>
Replacement java sprite routines, draws lots of small sprites quickly!<br>
Translucent sprites! Great for reflections, explosions and other special effects.<br>
Shadow masks. Give your sprites shadows for more realism.<br>
Resize sprites. Useful for games which are really 2d but still use perspective.<br>
Graduated or translucent rectangles - (Make great menu boxes.)<br>
Blur and greyscale functions.<br>
Screen transition effects - fade or scroll between screens.<br>
Rotate, flip, or skew sprites.<br>
Ripple effect, ripples any sprite horizontally for a watery effect.</p>
<p>3D-Graphics<br>
Uses our super-optimsed engine for fast 3d graphics.<br>
Create huge virtual worlds, potentially thousands of polygons big.<br>
Resize, rotate, or skew 3d objects in real time!<br>
Perspective correct texture mapping.<br>
Gourad shading, helps make objects look more rounded.<br>
Fogging - looks good and hides distant objects for more speed!<br>
Dynamic light sourcing! Change the direction of the light in real-time for cool effects.<br>
Animating textures, e.g A 3D TV could have an animating screen.<br>
3-Dimensional collision detection.<br>
Interlace option - only draws alternate lines for more speed on slower machines.</p>
<p>Music and sound<br>
Play module files as background music! (can replay .mod .s3m or .xm format)<br>
Play up to 64 sounds or instruments simultaneously!<br>
24-bit mixing and sample-interpolation for optimal sound quailty.<br>
Change the volume or speed of the music. Can also fade in and out.<br>
Speed-up or slow-down soundeffects to change pitch.</p>
<p>Multiplayer games<br>
Uses a 2nd java application which runs on your server and controls the game.<br>
Optimised networking routines ensure smooth gameplay.<br>
Chat facility, allows players to talk to each other.<br>
Waiting room where players can meet and challenge each other to games.<br>
Automatic save games - keep track of players scores.<br>
Scoring system &amp; league table - shows the top players.<br>
Multiple rooms allows hundred of games to run simultaneously.<br>
Link multiple games together into 1 program, so player can jump between them easily.<br>
Produce logs and statistics of everything that happens!<br>
Language filter helps prevent unwanted conversation.</p>
<p>Loading/Saving<br>
Compress data for quicker load times. Uses custom compression engine for comptability with all web-browsers.<br>
Script processor - put all the paremeters of the game in one text file so they can be easily altered to change the game, (e.g number of lives, player speed etc…)<br>
Loading bar - shows the loading progress when the applet is run.</p>
<p>Other<br>
Automatic frame insert system - keeps game running at a constant speed across a range of computers, and uses the extra available power for smoother graphics.<br>
Dual-build - The game will run equally well as an applet on a webpage, or as a standalone java application!<br>
Pop-up window - The game can appear in a new resizable window, rather than being embedded in the webpage.<br>
Hiscore table - Uses a perl cgi to automatically save the best players scores. [/code][/quote]Where did you find that?</p>
