    <description>When purchasing a Hermes Birkin bag it&#39;s important to be able to know if the Hermes Birkin bag is a fake. The Hermes Birkin bag is a status symbol to many. And lots of people purchase them on sites like Ebay, at what they think is a great bargain. Many of these bags are fakes though, whether or not the owner realizes it. Below are tips on how to know if a Hermes Birkin is fake or authentic.
Polished 18kt yellow gold-plated case in the shape of a handbag which dangles from a gold-plated base on the strap.

On an authentic Birkin, the stitching will be very even and tight. Also, the stitches on all Birkin handbags are called &quot;saddle stitches.&quot; This is when two stitches cross over each other to create an &quot;X&quot; pattern.Check all spelling on all printings on the bag, including any tags, engravings or stamps. Be sure that the words and brands are spelled correctly. For example, &quot;Hermes&quot; should not be spelled any other way. Another example would be if &quot;Birkin&quot; were spelled &quot;Berkin,&quot; that would be a giveaway that the bag is fake. Pictures in the listing are of the actual necklace for auction. P.S. Due to shooting angle, illumination changes and background color, there could be a little color difference.
