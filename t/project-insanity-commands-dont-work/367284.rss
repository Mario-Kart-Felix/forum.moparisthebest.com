    <title>Project Insanity Commands don&#39;t work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-commands-dont-work/367284</link>
    <description>Well i have been trying to use many different PI sources, and on most of them, most of the commands don&#39;t work. I would like to know how to fix it.
EX: ::item doesn&#39;t work at all.
I&#39;m used to delta and was wondering if the &quot;rights&quot; system is different and maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s not working.</description>
