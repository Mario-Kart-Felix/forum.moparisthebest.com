--------------------------------

Now let us forgot the crap I was spewing about America supplying so-and-so and let&#39;s focus on the real issue!

[img]http://img516.imageshack.us/img516/3286/moparevidence2cw8.jpg[/img]


Now in my humble opinion stating such a remarkable statement as this and allowing no further dispute against it is dictatorship..ish! And although this forum relies on dictatorship I just thought it was important to stand up against this act of crazehnezz and try to prove it wrong.

http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_was_China_involved_in_World_War_2

&lt;blockquote&gt;For China, the WW2 started earlier than 1937.  In September 1931, Japanese invaded China massively already.  Three provinces in the northeastern China was occupied as Japanese colony, which was normally called Manchurian in English.  But this term is never accepted by Chinese.  Today, it is still a strongly annoying word, especially for people living in that region. 

With the order of Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese President at that time, Chinese military forces withdrew from the northeast completely.  Most of them were sent to the northwest to fight against the Red Army of the Chinese Communist Party. 

Before the western countries were brought into the war in Europe, they were still be able to look after their interests in China.  Therefore, Japanese held its invasion steps to some extent. 

When Hitler&#39;s troops invaded in Poland, Japanese government believed that it was the time for more aggressive actions in China without caring the western countries&#39; concern.  Finally, in 1937, Japanese troops went across the Great Wall and invaded into the rest of China. 

Therefore, it is not a proper way to say &quot;how was China involved in the WW2&quot;.  The root of the war is originated from its continuous conflict against Japan. 

Answer

China being invaded by Japan in 1937 was a major partcipant in the pacific war against Japan. Japan exhausted much needed supplies on conquering the vast expanses of China. Although the Chinese Army was of limited quality and combat effectiveness her land provided many problems for the Japanese because of stretched supply lines.

Answer

In the decades leading up to WWII, China was in ruins. The last dynasty collapsed in 1911 (by then radio and airplane was already invented!). Europe had their hands all over China. Meanwhile, the revolutionary groups that took down the last dynasty began gaining momentum. The Koumingtang (KMT) or Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was in an power struggle of who would rule China. Japan invaded China in 1937, because of the civil war, Japan took many Chineses cities with little or no resistance. The KMT and CCP would have rather killed each other than fight the Japanese. There was a short period of cooperation but that didn&#39;t last long.

That was how they were involved in WWII because that was the conflict in the Pacific Theatre. The U.S. supplied the KMT with military advisors and artillery to fight the Japanese but they were finding out that they were using it to fight the Communists instead. The Americans were hoping that the KMT would distract the Japanese so they would have it easier in their own fight against Japan. But it didn&#39;t work. The Japanese started withdrawing troops from China to fight the US in the Pacific. Of course you know the outcome of that. The US dropped the A-Bomb and forced Japanese troops to surrender in China. The war was over.

Answer

Japan raped plundered and pillaged China prior to attacking the US at Pearl Harbor. As the war progressed China joined the Allied powers but were occupied by Japanese forces close to the border. When Colonel Doolittle took a group of pilots and attacked Japan&#39;s industrial sites in Tokyo and a couple other cities, China was the designated landing site. Unfortunately due to Japanese occupation for the most part - none of the planes made it back. Almost all of the pilots and crews did make it out but he felt it was a failure without the planes as well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now as we can see here there&#39;s a lot of words... and in amongst this mass of language are a few, more important words! Words such as &lt;blockquote&gt;China joined the Allied powers&lt;/blockquote&gt; And &lt;blockquote&gt;The US dropped the A-Bomb and forced Japanese troops to surrender in China&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now let us see, the world war, of the second sort, officially happened the dates of September 1, 1939 – September 2, 1945. Suspiciously China was at [b]WAR[/b] with Japan during these years. Now seeing as China is part of the World, and the world was at [b]WAR[/b], and China was also at [b]WAR[/b], this makes me think &quot;Hmmm, [b]CHINA WAS INVOLVED IN WW2!!!!!![/b]&quot;

Thank ye little citizens for taken ye sweet ol&#39; time to read/scan this post with your beady little eyes. I accept no responsibility for being completely wrong about this but accept all the credit for being correct.

It’s “World War II.” So, the fighting between China and Japan is actually very important, and it wasn’t just little fighting, it was a full out war [Sino-Japanese War, lasted about 8 years]. But if you refer to it as only the battles between axis/allies, you’re right - however, you really ought to refer to it with a more accurate name.</p>

Yet almost every country trades with them. The point of being involved in WW2 was to the extent that you were on either the one side or the other. China wasn’t on either side and was being in a war for their own good.</p>

<p>So japan invaded china, it’s not like china did anything of any worth in world war 2.  And like your answers said, it pretty much all stemmed from a war between japan and china in the decades before.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I actually just read a book about China’s involvement in WW2. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Sun" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Empire of the Sun</a> (By J.G. <a href="http://www.spikemagazine.com/1100jgballard.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Ballard</a>) which is written from the point of view of a young British child wandering around China, during the Japanese/Chinese war then through WW2. It’s a great novel and though the historical content is just a backdrop it is very detailed and a great read all the way through.</p>
<p>China was certainly involved in WW2 though not as much as some other nations. As Wikipedia says succinctly;  “After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Second Sino-Japanese War merged into the greater conflict of World War II.”</p>
