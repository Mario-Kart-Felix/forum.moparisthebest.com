    <title>How to find out what you&#39;ve gotten for the holidays</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-find-out-what-youve-gotten-for-the-holidays/164510</link>
    <description>Disclaimer- To any parent reading this after their kid got caught, FUCK OFF. To the kid, way to find a scape goat. Don&#39;t blame me if you get in trouble. If you do this right, you&#39;ll know everything that&#39;s under the tree, guaranteed.

Ok, now on how to commit this act of discretion. All you need is:


[ul][li]One arm of the scissors. (No, you don&#39;t have to break them in half, the sharper it is, the better.)[/li]
[li]Scotch, or the type of tape that your parents used to wrap your present[/li][/ul]


That&#39;s it, so now on how to actually do it.

So you got a present, and your wondering what the fuck it is, well here I am to help you.

Pick up your present, lets say it&#39;s a rectangle: [img]http://img103.imageshack.us/img103/3858/35548468wr8.png[/img]

Take your one scissor arm, or knife, or whatever you decided to use and make the following cuts.

[img]http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/6889/83039059wg8.png[/img]

 Make sure that you press down hard enough that it will make an incision, but at the same time won&#39;t tear a hole for your family to see every time they walk in the living room and you get grounded. If you can&#39;t make a clear incision that&#39;s straight, then try making light smooth ones that you go over a bunch of times to make a clear one. That&#39;s why, every year, I practice on my siblings presents to get back into being able to do it well. That way, I can do mine well, and I also know what they&#39;re getting (knowledge is power). If your an only child, your in luck, just use a smaller present from the back to start on, one that you know you&#39;ll be able grab in the present unwrapping and rip to shreds before your parents can see what you&#39;ve done.


Now that you&#39;ve made the cut, and know what I do every december, it&#39;s time to find out what your parents don&#39;t want you to know. Just fold back the paper, and see what&#39;s underneath. Do these cuts anywhere that you think will tell you what the gift is. I chose a place that most places put the title. but sometimes the side or the top works just as well. Once you are done, and you know what each of your gifts are, just put tape on the incisions, and it looks like nothing happened.

Happy gift searching!
