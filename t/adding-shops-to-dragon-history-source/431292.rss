    <title>Adding shops to Dragon history source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-shops-to-dragon-history-source/431292</link>
    <description>Well i think dragon history source is pretty sweet... i just wanted to add a new shop... i tried looking up some tutorials and most of them said to go into client.java and search for &quot;zeke&quot; or &quot;wanneshop&quot;... im assuming they do this because they need to justify the npc as a shop. when i search for either of those in my client.java, they do not come up...


So what file do i look in to find all the npcs that are shops so i can add a new one?</description>
