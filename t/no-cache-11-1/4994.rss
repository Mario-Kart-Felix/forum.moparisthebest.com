Wait, now it&#39;s saying..

Sorry an error has occured

To fix this try the following order

1: try closing all open web windows and reloading - DONE

2: try clearing your web browsers and cache from tools &gt; internet options - DONE

3- try using a different game world - ??

4- Try rebooting your comp - DONE

5- Try selecting a different version of java from the game menu - ermmm.. how? lol


Ok help please &lt;/3</description>
