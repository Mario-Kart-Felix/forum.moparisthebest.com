    <description>k, ive downloaded an source,
but now i edited it alot.

so after i done all the editing work i wanted to put it online 
so i changed all in no-ip and 127.0.0.1 to my no-ip,
i did this in client and server.

i also did in the client of the source.
so wen i run it i still only can log in into 127.0.0.1 or nothing.
but i cant log in in my no-ip and other people either.

i already did portforwarding
i already compiled cause most people think i forgot that.
so wat i need to do?</description>

              <p>I did the same thing,<br>
exactly.<br>
And it didn’t work.<br>
so what i did is redownloaded everything, and only changed the clients server ip under “gui.java”.<br>
Try only changing the server ip in the “gui.java” folder in the client.<br>
(make it your no-ip)</p>
