              <p>[b]This tutorial is by 007 Snoop From <a href="http://Rune-Server.Org" rel="nofollow noopener">Rune-Server.Org</a> I take no credit for this and am no way realted to the creation of this tutorial</p>
<p>Client Editing Tutorial [/b]</p>
<p>[QUOTE=007 Snoop;107821]Hello, In this tutorial you will be instructed on how to edit around a Runescape Client to fit your needs.<br>
This is for new people that do not know how to do this, so please dont flame me saying,"This is for nubs.’’</p>
<p>Ok to begin you need an Open Source Client,<br>
I will add the download link shortly.<br>
Next we need to Identify the important .java files that are used during client editing.     *<br>
[LIST]<br>
[<em>]Client.java - The main class of your client.[/LIST][LIST]<br>
[</em>]     * Signlink.java - A class in package ‘sign’.<br>
[<em>]     * Class30_Sub2_Sub1_sub1.java - .java where the background picture is specified to load from.[/LIST][LIST]<br>
[</em>]     * Frame_Sub1 - Creates the swing frame[/LIST]Ok, you want your client fully edited for your server right? So lets begin.<br>
To Change the name of the client go to - Client.java and click Edit &gt; Replace All<br>
Then Input the Client source’s name such as the download is, “Soulscape” and have it changed to your client name here, “Client Name here.”<br>
Once that has been completed go to your Frame_Sub1.java and find where it says, “Soulscape” change that to your client’s name. That will display your clients name at the top left of the application when it is activated.</p>
<p>Now to change the background picture. The should already be a .jpg picture in the clients folder just replace it with another picture that you want as your clients background. <span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=Red]WARNING - The picture must be named bg.jpg for it to work!<br>
[/COLOR]</span>[COLOR=Red]<br>
[COLOR=Black]Now with that out of the way lets say you want your client to load the cache from a different location than the client folder. Go to the folder named, “sign” and find the signlink.java file and open it. When you have opened the file search for," /cache/" Then replace that with the folder the cache will be loaded from such as, “C:/windows/”<br>
Then right above that you should see, “.file_store_32” change that to the folder that the cache is loaded from such as, “.mpr_file_store_32” that would load it from Moparscape’s downloaded cache.<br>
[COLOR=Red]<span class="bbcode-b">For all of the above changes to be made, be sure to compile!</span>[/COLOR]</p>
<p>That concludes my tutorial, but edits and more things will be added.<br>
Credits are to me for making this.<br>
Comments/posts are appreciated.<br>
Thanks,<br>
