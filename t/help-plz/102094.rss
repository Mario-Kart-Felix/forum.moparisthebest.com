          <blockquote>
              <p>A majority of all servers are hamachi… If you have downloaded hamachi, I have a server that is up 24/7<br>
(nobody on atm)<br>
warmwaddle6<br>
password: 123<br>
Port: 43594 (its default so dont change it when you bring up moparscape)<br>
I.P. = <a href="http://warmwaddle.servegame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">warmwaddle.servegame.com</a><br>
Now I think someone posted hamachi in the download section…I’m not sure where it is. But when you download it, install it, and at the bottem of the hamachi window there are three buttons. Click the middle one, and a list will pop up. Select the one that says “join an existing network” and put warmwaddle6 in the title spot, and 123 in the password spot. Click ok, then get on moparscape (use the webclient, at <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>) And use any username and password in the  correct spots, then type <a href="http://warmwaddle.servegame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">warmwaddle.servegame.com</a> in the spot marked IP:. Hope this helped!!</p>
