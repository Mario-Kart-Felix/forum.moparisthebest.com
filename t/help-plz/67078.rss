    <description>I know there are lots of tutorials for this, but I get confused really easily. I&#39;ve read the forum rules and I know how they I&#39;ve had my own share of forums.. I just  have no java coding experience at all and I just want a mess around with runescape on my own server. I need someone to walk me through how to make a basic private Runescape server for myself and others.. If someone can get me started in the right direction and get my server running I can carry on from there. I have the most recent Java.. I&#39;ve gotten sources.. I&#39;ve changed names, ports, you name it I&#39;ve done it and I cant seem to get it to work.. So if someone could help me via MSN that would be most helpful.

Thanks
