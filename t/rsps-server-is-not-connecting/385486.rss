    <title>RSPS - Server is not connecting!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-server-is-not-connecting/385486</link>
    <description>Hello...My second help thread,it looks like I keep getting various answers,so I am VERY confused.

basicly,the problem i have having is I can log onto my rsps but other&#39;s cant.

Runelocus said its online,(sorry for advertising)
and so do other sites.

Secondly,I think he has something to do with the IP&#39;s set in the files.etc etc etc

To tell you what I have them set to,

this is what they are.

SOURCE FILES:CLIENT FILE IN SOURCE FILES NEED AN IP CHANGED,SO DOES THE SERVER FILE IN THIS FOLDER!(SOURCE FILES FOLDER,NOT PLAY CLIENT)

NOW ,LASTLY,THE PLAY CLIENT NEEDS AN IP SET IN THE GUI.

Now I will tell you the IP&#39;S set in each of these FILES,NOT FOLDERS!

IN PLAY CLIENT=GUI:My NO-IP

IN SERVER FILES=CLIENT FILE IS SET TO 0.0.0.0 AND SERVER FILE IS SET TO MY NO-IP

Is this right?

Thanks,hope someone actually helps this time.... :(</description>
