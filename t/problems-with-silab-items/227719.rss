    <title>Problems with Silab Items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-silab-items/227719</link>
    <description>Hey, I am using Funscape source, and it says it has all the silab items and they all work. But when I get them in Silab client, they all appear as random items (wrong id&#39;s)
Can someone help me, if I need to edit code or whatever?

Will offer mod position if you want.

I got a client with the source, but it got as far as Unpacking Config, then told me there was an error with the cache I think. 

If that is the problem someone please help me.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 24, 2008, 02:26:12 am[/size][hr]Anyone please HELP ME!? :eek: :(</description>
