    <title>[562] simple commands needed [562]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-simple-commands-needed-562/356502</link>
    <description>Okay these are a few commands that i am either missing, or don&#39;t work for my 562, would be really helpful for someone to post there command!
1- ipban username             -admin only
2- teleall                          -admin only
3- checkbank username      -admin only
4- clearbank username       -admin only
5- this isn&#39;t a command, just need the code for a working 562 economy reset.
6- ::food (gives 10k shark)
7- ::rules (with 10 &quot; &quot; areas for me to add rules, or just edit)
8- update (amount of seconds)      -admin only
or any other snippets that someone could please post that would be useful.
I HAVE IN FACT USED THE SEARCH BAR, AND LOOKED IN TUTORIALS SECTIONS AND COULD NOT FIND THESE! SO DON&#39;T FLAME!!! :cool:
--the admin only means that it is only for the commands used by admins when they press the button under esc, &quot;`&quot;.</description>
