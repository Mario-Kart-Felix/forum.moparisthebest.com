    <title>[Help] Shop Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-shop-error/132419</link>
    <description>I was using ShopMaker today and when I added the stuff into shops.cfg and autospawn.cfg and client.java I got an error in the client.java when I was trying to recompile. This is it(see attachment)

If you need to see my client.java where the wanneshp = 2 is I&#39;ll get that. Just tell me which and how much of it you need/want to see.</description>
