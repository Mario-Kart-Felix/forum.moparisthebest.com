    <title>NPC&#39;s are not cooperating</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npcs-are-not-cooperating/316811</link>
    <description>There are two things that I have tried with the NPC&#39;s and they just are not working out.

First off, I am trying to make an Otherworldy Being freeze a player on one out of every 5 attacks.
The code for his attacks look like this... (npchandler.java)

[code]						} else if (npcs[NPCID].npcType == 126 &amp;&amp; misc.random(5)==1) {
					       npcs[NPCID].animNumber = 1979;
					       plr.specGFX(370);
					       plr.ifFreeze(20);               
					       plr.sM(&quot;The being freezes you solid!&quot;);
hitDiff = 5 + misc.random(40);[/code]


All the effects that are called for occur when he uses this attack, but after it hits the player, he is still able to move freely.
ifFreeze is the effect that is supposed to freeze the player and keep him from moving.
I can tell Its being called properly because it sends the message &quot;You have been frozen!&quot; when the npc uses this attack (along with the one listed above).
Here is the public void in client.java, I&#39;m thinking the void might be messed up.

[code]
public void ifFreeze() {
if(EntangleDelay &gt; 0) {
sM(&quot;You have been frozen!&quot;);
toX = absX;
toY = absY;
                newWalkCmdSteps = 0;
                newWalkCmdX[0] = newWalkCmdY[0] = tmpNWCX[0] = tmpNWCY[0] = 0;
                getNextPlayerMovement();
}
}[/code]
Any suggestions?

Second off, I am trying to make it so Nezikchened (NPC, Attackable, ID = 934) can only be damaged by melee attacks.

One thing that worked was making it so his health refilled everytime he was attacked if the player did not have a ranged item equipped.
But that looked a little messy (his hp bar flew back and forth) and using mage on him with a bow equipped would have hit him, which is not what I wanted.

Any suggestions?</description>
