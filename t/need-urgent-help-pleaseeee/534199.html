<pre><code>Diary of private mason, England (1893-1915)
</code></pre>
<p>June 19th, 1915<br>
Tomorrow is going to be my first day in the trenches, yesterday our team, Delta<br>
Squad 8, had a special training from sergeant Patrick Conneil. He appears to<br>
have a lot of experience with the modern warfare in trenches, our team learned a<br>
lot about what we to do in certain situations. For example, what we have to do<br>
when a gas grenade is thrown near us. Anyways we are really excited to prove<br>
ourself to our country. My team seems to consist of a lot of nice guys and we are<br>
really getting close, now I am going to catch some sleep.</p>
<p>June 20th, 1915<br>
I am at the hospital, the war is absolutely horrible! Today was our first day in the<br>
trenches. I have never been so scared in my entire life, 2 People out of our team<br>
got killed by some German machine gunners and my leg is almost blown of by<br>
some damn motar. Everyone is so scared and we all want to go back home, this<br>
was not as they had led us to believe it was. I am so afraid that I will never see<br>
my family back.</p>
<p>June 21th, 1915<br>
Ofcourse I was already thinking about how it should feel to kill an human being.<br>
Today was the first day I actually shot someone, suprisingly it didn’t do that much 	to me.<br>
Because of this war I don’t seem to see humans like humans anymore.<br>
There aren’t any norms or values out here. I think that all of my ‘normal’ human<br>
emotions are gone, all I feel is anger, everyone feels so much anger. Anger<br>
towards the government and everything and everyone. The only light in this cloud<br>
of darkness is Jacob, he has become my brother in arms and I surely would catch 	a bullet for him.</p>
<p>June 22th, 1915<br>
What are we doing here? Today our team, although what is left of our team,<br>
realised that this war is so pointless. Everyone is just killing each other but for<br>
what? Some soldier are so desperate for the war to be over that they just shoot<br>
themself in a random body part so they didn’t have to participate in the fight.<br>
Everything is such a mess, our medical condition just sucks and we are running<br>
out of food and all sort of medical supplies. I have no idea how or when this war is<br>
going to end but I know how I am going to end.</p>
<p>June 23th, 1915<br>
Jacob is death. Now I am absolutely empty, this war is changing me. I don’t feel<br>
any regrets when killing someone nor I feel any sadness for the death of jacob.<br>
All I can think of is surviving. It seems like this war turned off my emotions and<br>
turned on my instinct. I feel so tired but still so alert.</p>
<p>June 24th, 1915<br>
Today we had our first clash with gas. It was really horrible, I was just on time with<br>
my mask but 2 other people weren’t that lucky. We had to put them in a car and<br>
they were sent to the hospital. After that we walked for a couple of houres, tired<br>
and broken but still alert for any sounds. We lost like the half of our team, still<br>
counting. Every 5 minutes I think about killing myself but I just can’t seem to do it.</p>
<p>June 25th, 1915<br>
We are now reinforcing with the french troops but it’s a chaos over here. All I can<br>
here is people shouting and shooting, what is wrong with the world…</p>
<p>So this is my writing assignment, we had to make a diary of a soldier in the trenches.<br>
Could anyone tell me if the grammar/story is okay?<br>
and if not how I should improve it</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

        <p>Wow, we were set the exact same assignment. Yours looks pretty good, can you review mine? Cheers man.</p>
<p>May 19th, 1915<br>
Today marks my first day out of basic training. It was a solemn day but at the same time I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. The males around me also felt in similar compassion, with likewise regrets and remorse. However I decided to look towards star and take method forward… mother always said that no man can live on bread alone.</p>
<p>May 19th, 1915<br>
Wow, what a night. Lizards crawling around the tent, their glow reflecting off the cobwebs in the westerly wind. It’s times like these that I really miss the life before military. My mother always used to say - once a man, always a man. Never take life forgranted. I made my first friend today - his name was Jeff and we share many common interests. He likes similar music artists such as Green Day, and also enjoys watching movies in the cinema. Funny how you can be dispatched to remote parts of the world and meet such similar people.</p>
<p>May 22th, 1915<br>
Mother always said that life is like a box of chocolates, some white, some brown, some with coconut and others with a delicoous juicy fondant in the centre. Today I had my first experience of friendly fire. Jeff was messing around with some bazooka the 7th General 4th Batallion II Wing Commander officer had given him, but accidently fired it 30 degrees northbound of my position. It caused most of my hair to catch fire so I had to be shaved, but the priest says I shall recover.</p>
<p>May 23th, 1915<br>
A hard day. We met the Italian regiment today and they were pretty fun guys. One guy, Marconi, showed me how to make pizza with the carburetter of our supply truck… and it was pretty damn good. Never again will I judge a race of people on their skin colour.</p>
<p>May 24th, 1915<br>
Steamy day with the lads again. Mostly training, but we also took a look down at Camp Bastille and shot at some immigrants. Mother always said to me, one immigrant is just another immigrant. Coming here to take our jobs. And in hindsight, she was correct. But the moment I pulled the trigger on that brown man was the day I sold my soul to the US Army. Never again will I look at a brown person in the same way. The look on his face was unbearable and I will never forget the image in my head. However I must now finish the letter as Jeff is calling me for some delicious rabbit stew.</p>

He likes similar music artists such as Green Day, and also enjoys watching movies in the cinema. Funny how you can be dispatched to remote parts of the world and meet such similar people.</p>
<p>May 22th, 1915<br>
Mother always said that life is like a box of chocolates, some white, some brown, some with coconut and others with a delicoous juicy fondant in the centre. Today I had my first experience of friendly fire. Jeff was messing around with some bazooka the 7th General 4th Batallion II Wing Commander officer had given him, but accidently fired it 30 degrees northbound of my position. It caused most of my hair to catch fire so I had to be shaved, but the priest says I shall recover.</p>
<p>May 23th, 1915<br>
A hard day. We met the Italian regiment today and they were pretty fun guys. One guy, Marconi, showed me how to make pizza with the carburetter of our supply truck… and it was pretty damn good. Never again will I judge a race of people on their skin colour.</p>
<p>May 24th, 1915<br>
Steamy day with the lads again. Mostly training, but we also took a look down at Camp Bastille and shot at some immigrants. Mother always said to me, one immigrant is just another immigrant. Coming here to take our jobs. And in hindsight, she was correct. But the moment I pulled the trigger on that brown man was the day I sold my soul to the US Army. Never again will I look at a brown person in the same way. The look on his face was unbearable and I will never forget the image in my head. However I must now finish the letter as Jeff is calling me for some delicious rabbit stew.[/quote]</p>
<p>Looks quite realistic and cool, except for this part:</p>

<pre><code>Diary of private mason, England (1893-1915)

<p>June 19th, 1915<br>
Tomorrow is going to be my first day in the trenches<span class="bbcode-b">.</span> Yesterday<span class="bbcode-i">,</span> our team<span class="bbcode-i">delete ,</span> Delta<br>
Squad 8, had <span class="bbcode-b">delete a</span> special training from sergeant Patrick Conneil. He appears to<br>
have a lot of experience with the modern warfare in trenches,<span class="bbcode-b">use a transitional word, e.g., as</span> our team learned a lot about what we (<span class="bbcode-b">I think you forgot to put the word need here</span>) to do in certain situations<span class="bbcode-i">,e.g.,</span> what we have to do<br>
when a gas grenade is thrown near us. Anyways<span class="bbcode-b">,</span> we are really excited to prove<br>
oursel<span class="bbcode-b">ves</span> to our country. My team seems to consist of a lot of nice guys and we are<br>
really getting close<span class="bbcode-b">.</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Transitional Word</span>Now I am going to catch some sleep.</p>
<p>June 20th, 1915<br>
I am at the hospital,<span class="bbcode-i">use a conjunction instead of a comma</span> the war is absolutely horrible! Today was our first day in the<br>
trenches. I have never been so scared in my entire life<span class="bbcode-b">.</span> 2 <span class="bbcode-b">p</span>eople out of our team<br>
got killed by some German machine gunners and my leg is almost blown of<span class="bbcode-b">f</span> by<br>
some damn <span class="bbcode-b">mortar</span>. Everyone is so scared and we all want to go back home<span class="bbcode-b">.</span> this<br>
was not <span class="bbcode-i">what</span> they had led us to believe it was. I am so afraid that I will never see<br>
my family <span class="bbcode-b">again</span>.</p>
<p>June 21th, 1915<br>
Of<span class="bbcode-b">space</span>course<span class="bbcode-i">,</span> I was already thinking about how it should feel to kill <span class="bbcode-b">a</span> human being.<br>
Today was the first day I actually shot someone<span class="bbcode-b">.</span> <span class="bbcode-b">Surprisingly,</span> it didn’t do that much 	to me.<br>
Because of this war<span class="bbcode-b">,</span> I don’t seem to see humans like humans anymore.<br>
There aren’t any norms or values out here. I think that all of my ‘normal’ human<br>
emotions are gone<span class="bbcode-b">.</span> All I feel is anger<span class="bbcode-b">.</span> Everyone feels so much anger. Anger<br>
towards the government and everything and everyone. The only light in this cloud<br>
of darkness is Jacob<span class="bbcode-b">;</span> he has become my brother in arms and I surely would <span class="bbcode-i">take</span> 	a bullet for him.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s all I felt like reviewing. Put it through an online grammar checker or at least word processor. There are spelling errors word would catch.</p>
