    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-problem-rep-to-anyone-who-can-figure-out/396868</link>
    <description>ok so ive been stuck on this for the longest time and it seems like no one knows how to fix this? This is my code below:  and its suppost to convert 500 tokkul into 50k cash. but theres one problem. Say you have 501 or 1000 tokkul and use it, it will only give you 50k but take away all the tokkul you have on you. I want to fix this because i&#39;m going to have the same thing but for money to tokkul and i dont want someone to waste max cash getting 500 tokkul =/ i tried it as a command and now as a chest/object. and its results are the same. this is all in my actionhandler file on a &quot;[pi]&quot; if someone please can help me with this or give me a code ill rep++  -thanks guys


//tokkul chest
		case 2182:
			if(c.getItems().playerHasItem(6529, 500)){
			c.getItems().deleteItem(6529, 500);
			c.getItems().addItem(995, 50000);
        		c.sendMessage(&quot;Here ya go 50k well earned!&quot;);
			} else
			if(!c.getItems().playerHasItem(6529, 500)){
         		c.sendMessage(&quot;Not enough tokkul!&quot;);
