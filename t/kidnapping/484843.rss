Idk… If someone who just ripped me from my entire life and started trying to tell me that a house I had lived in for 20 years was all of a sudden wire tapped I would remain skeptical.

<p>Maybe I’m thinking too clearly because I’m not in that situation, I just don’t find myself being that naive. It just feels like everything doesn’t add up to her having to live that kind of life for that long.[/quote]<br>
As stated before, she’s quite naive.  We’re talking young innocent girl that accepts rides from strangers, not person who debates on forums and is quite knowledgeable about the modern technology, weapons, etc.  Looking at some of the teens from my school, most of them think getting on their friend’s Facebook when they’re not looking is hacking, and thinks that Obama is the anti chirist, I’d say the chances of her being naive enough to believe her situation are quite high.</p>

<p>I think that this is all fake, i doubt this actually happened the way it was explained. Everything just doesn’t make sense, the way she acted and such. It would have made sense if she had tried to escape but she didn’t so i believe she was their on her own bondage fantasies. Probably found him on creigs list or something.[/quote]<br>
This happened a long time ago, not sure it was even around then.</p>
<p>The only reason I’d believe it is because if you’re naive enough to accept random rides from strangers, you’re likely to believe something that’s drilled into your head after a year or so whilst being tortured.</p>
