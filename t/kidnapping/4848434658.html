Idk… If someone who just ripped me from my entire life and started trying to tell me that a house I had lived in for 20 years was all of a sudden wire tapped I would remain skeptical. Not sure when security cameras that weren’t the size of cinder blocks were created, but she could have easily wrote it on a piece of paper, sent it in the mail, and much more.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m thinking too clearly because I’m not in that situation, I just don’t find myself being that naive. It just feels like everything doesn’t add up to her having to live that kind of life for that long.</p>

As stated before, she’s quite naive.  We’re talking young innocent girl that accepts rides from strangers, not person who debates on forums and is quite knowledgeable about the modern technology, weapons, etc.  Looking at some of the teens from my school, most of them think getting on their friend’s Facebook when they’re not looking is hacking, and thinks that Obama is the anti chirist, I’d say the chances of her being naive enough to believe her situation are quite high.</p>
