    <description>When the intercourse (sexual reference) of 1337 people and their rights are like encroached on, we don’t like it. And we make this.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all 1337 members are created equal, that they are endowed by moparisthebest.com with certain unalienable rights that among these are Posting, Spam and the pursuit of Fagginess. — That to secure these rights, websites are instituted among 1337, deriving their just powers from the consent of the not-as-cool-members, — That whenever any form of power becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right (yes, our right) of the 1337 to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new website, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their 1337ness and Fagginess. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that websites long established should not be changed for light and transient causes (‘cus we been through shit, yah dig); and accordingly all experience hath shown that not-as-cool-members are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses (sexual and uhh, just unwanted kthx) and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their (the 1337) right, it is their duty (our duty), to throw off such crazy-ass-bitches, and to provide new firewalls (to protect from the hackers lolz) for their future security. — Such has been the patient ass-to-ass molestation of these veterans; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of communist rule (rly). The history of the present ruler of moparisthebest.org, (his holiness moparisthebest) is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute communist rule over these 1337 folks. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

moparisthebest has refused our right to freedom of posting, (if we want to frikin’ post let us post, yah dig?) necessary for the public good.

moparisthebest has refused our moderators the ability to make rules of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his (ass)ent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them

moparisthebest has refused to pass other rules for the accommodation of the vast majority of the 1337 community, ‘cus he’s a tyrant.

He has called together administrative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable (due to the ass-chaps), and distant from the depository of their public face, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them (with molestation) into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved 1337 communities repeatedly, for opposing his stupid-ass regime.

He has refused (since he went gay), after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the administrative powers, incapable of xxxplosion, have returned to the 1337 at large for their exercise; the community remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has allowed too many people (who have joined before) join again (and that ain’t cool); for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Pride and Pedophilia (a spin on Pride and Prejudice) ; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations to Hitler, and raising the conditions of new sites (with free hax &lt;.&lt;).

His word is the law, and it bites (kthx).

He has made the staff dependent on his will (‘cus he kinda owns the site but who cares) alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries (ahaha yea right).

He has erected (I TOLD YOU HE WAS GAY) a multitude of new positions, and sent evil folks to steal our gp.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, mercenaries to murder/rape our women and children (who are men confidentially) without our damn consent (we would LET YOU FOR GP)..

He has affected to render (GFX) the programmers independent of and superior to the 1337 power of the 1337 people ‘cus we’re 1337.

He gets other peeps from other sites to boss us around (WTF).

For quartering large bodies of leechers among us:

For protecting them, by keeping the damn registrations open, and allowing their scammings nooby asses to go unpunished for the bad stuff they do which they should commit on the 1337 members of this site:

For cutting off our gp sales with all parts of the internet:

For imposing gay rules that make no sense on us (without our consent):

For depriving us of the ability to defend our 1337 asses when someone says we scammed:

For banning us without being tried by staff:

For giving us gay popups and spyware and shit-like-that:

For taking away our rights to advertise our new websites (newb):

For suspending our secret society meetings in which we whip each other for our own pleasure:

He doesn’t do shit to help us:

He has plundered our gp, ravaged our mothers, wasted our lives, and destroyed the reputations of countless 1337 people.

He is at this time is getting tons of leechers to come join these forums so he can get more gp.

He has convinced others to be gay with him.

He has made us all really angry, and we don’t like it.

In every stage our oppressions, we have been ignored, and banned, so we made this cool paper.

We don’t want to be mean to you (not-as-cool-members) but, you will remain oppressed.

We, therefore, the 1337 members of the moparisthebest.org community, hereby establish our own separate lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor (And prepare for battle ‘cus we can do some pretty nasty shit—if you know what we mean).

-1337 People who will fight for our cause:

Thomas Jizzonson (Jewsus)

John Hanoncock (Annex)

George Washingincum (DraculaZ, Cowbell, Jon, WHATEVER YOUR DAMN NAME IS)

Benjamin Franklessin (Jansen)

William Whipplinipple (MittenZ)

Fight for the cause pl0x &lt;.&lt;

(This document was initially posted on Sythe.org by me, and the revolution is spreading kthxbai)

And this was posted due to moparisthebest&#39;s tyrannical leadership and/or his desire for us to join his forum, but we disregarded his request for joining without inciting rebellion...&#39;cus we 1337 and all that jazz...G&#39;day</description>
