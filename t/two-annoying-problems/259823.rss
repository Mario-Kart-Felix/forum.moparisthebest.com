    <description>Lately I&#39;ve been working on getting a ingames highscores shown on a scoreboard, and a fully working Dark bow.


My problem with the scoreboard is that instead of listing the top 10 online players, it lists a bunch of gibberish. For example, the first rank might be

Rank 1: [Ljava.lang.string.;@1510077 - Total level : []@f599d2

And so on. Then, if you exit that window and click the highscore board again, it&#39;s usually just blank. This is what i have in...

My Server.java - 

[code]/*Highscores*/
   /*For more highscores to be recorded, change the #s in [] to the number you want kept, +1*/
   /*For example, if you want the top 20, put 21 in the [] ([21])*/
   public static int[] ranks = new int[11];
   public static String[] rankPpl = new String[11];
[/code]

I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s in the right spot because it doesn&#39;t show any errors when i compile, and i don&#39;t know where else to put it than underneath 
[code]
 public static final int cycleTime = 500;
[/code]

This is what&#39;s in my client.java

[code]//In-game highscores
public int playerRank = 0;

public void resetRanks() {
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
      server.ranks[i] = 0;
      server.rankPpl[i] = &quot;&quot;;
   }
}

public void highscores() {
   clearQuestInterface();
   sendQuest(&quot;@dbl@&quot;, 8144);  //Title
   sendQuest(&quot;@dre@~In-Game Top 10 Highscores~&quot;, 8145);
   for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { // you also need to change this for it to display more, simply the number you want it to display, say 20 = for(int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++)
      if(server.ranks[i] &gt; 0) {
         sendQuest(&quot;@bla@Rank &quot;+(i+1)+&quot;: @red@&quot;+server.rankPpl+ &quot;@bla@ - Total Lvl:@whi@ &quot; +server.ranks, 8147+i);
      }
   }
   sendQuestSomething(8143);
   showInterface(8134);
   flushOutStream();
   resetRanks();
}
//end highscores
[/code]

that&#39;s underneath my 
[code]public class client extends Player implements Runnable {[/code]

And stil in my clent, under my case 132, I have
[code]        case 132:
           int objectX = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndianA();
            int objectID = inStream.readUnsignedWord();
            int objectY = inStream.readUnsignedWordA();
            int face = 0;
            int face2 = 0;
            int GateID = 1;
            //highscores
if(objectID == 3192)
{
highscores();
}            [/code]


So that&#39; my first problem, any help guiding me in what i need to fix would be great. I don&#39;t need the exact code, I can figure that for myself. Just some guidance here is all I&#39;m asking. 


My second problem is with the Dbow. 

So far I&#39;ve gotten it to shoot from a distance, but the person attacking with the bow still runs up to the target.

There&#39;s alot of stuff or the Dbow in my client.java, so for saving time I won&#39;t post everything like I did above. 
If you want proof of my progress ask me for anyting specifically and I&#39;ll post it up immediately.

And once again just some guidance on how to make it so you don&#39;t run up to the target would be great.</description>
