    <title>Three things: Repeating actions,Timers, and Click-to-remove objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/three-things-repeating-actions-timers-and-click-to-remove-objects/246359</link>
    <description>I need help with three things:

1. Making actions repeat. I really want to make it so like if you click on a spinning wheel it doesn&#39;t just give you one but instead changes your whole inventory of flax; another example would be clicking a fishing spot, how would I make it so if you click it it continually fishes and you don&#39;t have to click again.

2. I want to learn to add timers, from the above example fishing spots, I want to make it so that when you click something it has a delay and then dose the stuff like mining a rock, I want to learn how to add timers so that you have to wait a few seconds before you successfully get the ore.

3. I want to know how you would make it so like if you were to click an object it would delete it then after a while (probally using timers) the object would respawn: if you need a visual I want to do that with my Cabbage case:

[code]

case 1161:
setAnimation(2292);
addItem(1965,1);
sendMessage(&quot;You pick a cabbage.&quot;);
break;

[/code]

[hr]

Any help will be greatly appreciated!</description>
