    <description>OK guys seriously this is the 3rd or 4th time i posted this and i need some help please.

Ok the first thing i need help with is my ::item command im using vividscape v1 and it&#39;s ::item command is messed up it has item command but when ever i do ::item 3101 1 or ::item 391 1 nothing comes in my inventory....


My second problem is not so big but i could not fix it again it&#39;s with vividscape cuz im using it as a base and well basicly there are gaps between my commands in the quest tab.

This is what i mean look at next pic and see what i did.
