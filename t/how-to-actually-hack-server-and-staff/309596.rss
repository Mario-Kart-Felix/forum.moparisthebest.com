    <title>How to actually &quot;hack&quot; server and staff!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-actually-hack-server-and-staff/309596</link>
    <description>Okay well i saw another post about &quot;hacking owner&quot; but it was a big fake and the guy was just advertising his server. So im going to actually tell you how to &quot;hack&quot; staff but not the owner :/ 

1. Its pretty simple actually. Go to a website that has servers on it.

2. Pick a server and make sure its 317 and not 508 or it wont work. 

3. Now to do this you will need to be on either moparscapes client (moparisthebest.com) or silab&#39;s client (client.silabsoft.org). 

4. Now log in with some normal dumb name and make sure the owner isnt on. 

5. If he isnt thats a good thing. Find out what his name is then log out. 

6. Lets say for now that it is Owner Bob. So for the username type in Owner Bob

7. Now after Owner Bob put a bunchhh of spaces and then start spamming random letters.

8. It will look something like this.....Owner Bob              adsfsdfhfhsncsdck

9. Now you are doing it exactly right. Now just type in a password. (doesnt matter what it is)

10. and then simply log in. 

11. Now its time to do the &quot;hacking&quot; Find any admin or mod. Go up to him and be like hi chris(lets say his name is chris). Do you want to have co-owner?

12. Obviously he will say yes. If he doesnt..well he is reallyy retarded.

13. Once, or if, he says yes be like okay tell me your password so that I can make you it. The command needs your password for safety reasons.

14. Now if the guy believes you, which some do, then he will give you his password.

15. Then tell him to log out for 30 seconds then come back in. 

16. So when he logs out, log onto his account quick and type in ::pass (then a password)

And boom!! YOU HAVE A STAFF ACCOUNT AND HAVE OFFICIALLY &quot;HACKED&quot; THE SERVER 

hope you liked it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</description>
