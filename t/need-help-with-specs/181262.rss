    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-specs/181262</link>
    <description>Okay so heres the thing,

I have specs for like everything on my server... However since no one can obtain the  G Maul i want to make it 

have unlimited specs....

Okay so i heard a lot of things about files but the one that a mod wanted was this:

}
					if (playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4153 &amp;&amp; specialAmount &gt;= 50) {
    					ProjectileSpec(340, absY, absX, offsetY, offsetX, AttackingOn, EnemyY, EnemyX);
  					calculateSpecial();
   					maulSpec();
    					usingSpecial = false;
    					specialDamage = 0;
    					specia

i dont know if thats exactly everything but yeah

the mod never replied back to my post =/ so yeah and if there are tuts on this could u please tell me the link? thanks!

But just a reminder im mainly trying to get these:

Unlimited Spec (the main objective)
Admin+ item 

I really need this because my server seems to be popular and with spec updates it may be favored more =D</description>
