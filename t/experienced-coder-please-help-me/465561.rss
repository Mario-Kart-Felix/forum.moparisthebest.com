    <description>Time and time again I&#39;ve tried to make a Runescape private server, I&#39;ve tried 100s of clients and sources that never work.
I know barely any Java and when I do get a decent source and client I can never put into a web-client or .java client.
I know if you help me create the server you gain nothing from it; if you can make me a server you can obviously make your own so why would you need Co-owner rank etc. but I&#39;ve been trying to do this for ages and It is really stressful and I know a few people on here could whip up a decent server in 5 minutes if they wanted to.

If anyone kind enough is willing to help me then add my skype: Joshb1rd or message me on here.</description>
