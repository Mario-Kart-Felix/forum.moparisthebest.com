              <p>LOL there is no seaching needed its called common sense all you have to do is go down the list and change it. For example when i first started coding i didnt make a dumb ass topic like this o no no no i changed the values to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ect then ran my server</p>
<p>This is exactly what i did</p>
<p><code>[SKILLS]
character-skill = 0	1	0
character-skill = 1	2	0
character-skill = 2	3	0
character-skill = 3	4	0
character-skill = 4	5	0
character-skill = 5	6	0
character-skill = 6	7	0
character-skill = 7	8	0
character-skill = 8	9	0
character-skill = 9	10	0
character-skill = 10	11	0
character-skill = 11	12	0
character-skill = 12	13	0
character-skill = 13	14	0
character-skill = 14	15	0
character-skill = 15	16	0
character-skill = 16	17	0
character-skill = 17	18	0
character-skill = 18	19	0
character-skill = 19	20	0
character-skill = 20	21	0
character-skill = 21	22	0
character-skill = 22	23	0
character-skill = 23	24	0
character-skill = 24	25	0</code></p>
