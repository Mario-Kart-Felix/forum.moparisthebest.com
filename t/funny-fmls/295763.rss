Mine:

Today, I was walking through Borders with my girlfriend, when we pass a girl scout cookies stand. I see a box of Samoas, my favorite, point at them, and shout, &#39;YEAH&#39;. My girlfriend looks shocked. Behind the box of cookies was a five year old scout bending over, with her bottom pointed at me. FML

Today, I was on the phone bragging to a friend about losing my virginity last night. When I went downstairs, my 6 year old sister was digging through my purse. She explained that she had overheard my conversation and wanted to help me find my virginity. My mom was in the kitchen with us. FML

Today, I heard my sister masturbating in her room. I took the dog around the block to get out of the house, and I came back to see her leaving her room... my electric toothbrush in her hand. FML</description>

<p>Today, I lost a bet with my girlfriend. I now have to wear a shirt saying “Worlds Smallest Penis” everywhere I go for a month. FML</p>
<p>Today, I asked a woman where her beautiful accent was from. The woman stared at me for a while. Then her daughter told me that the reason her mother talked like that was because she had a stroke a few months ago. FML</p>
<p>Today, my boyfriend and I went on our 2nd date. We decided to get to know each other with a game. I asked him what makes him nervous. He said “talking to really attractive girls.” I then asked him if I was making him nervous. He said no. FML</p>
<p>Today, I went to get a pedicure for the first time. My feet are VERY ticklish. I reflexively kicked the poor lady in the face, as I wet my pants. FML</p>
<p>Today, my nose was itchy. As I reached towards it to itch it, I sneezed ridiculously hard. I punched myself in the eye and now it’s all purple and puffy. FML</p>
<p>Today, my boyfriend introduced me to his family. They were drinking and having fun, so I joined in. I had one too many, got really goofy and then suggested the farting game. “Sorry, I can’t hold my liquor!” I quickly explained. My boyfriend’s mom shot me a cold look and said, “It’s non-alcoholic.” FML</p>
<p>Today, I walked in on my husband in our room completely naked. At first I thought he was waiting for me so we could have sex. He hadn’t seen me yet, so I started to undress too to surprise him. Then I saw that he had drawn a face on his penis and he was talking to it. FML</p>
<p>Today, it was my 21st birthday. All my friends showed up at my house already drunk, so I had to be the designated driver. FML</p>

<p>Mine:</p>
<p>Today, I was walking through Borders with my girlfriend, when we pass a girl scout cookies stand. I see a box of Samoas, my favorite, point at them, and shout, ‘YEAH’. My girlfriend looks shocked. Behind the box of cookies was a five year old scout bending over, with her bottom pointed at me. FML</p>
<p>Today, I was on the phone bragging to a friend about losing my virginity last night. When I went downstairs, my 6 year old sister was digging through my purse. She explained that she had overheard my conversation and wanted to help me find my virginity. My mom was in the kitchen with us. FML</p>
<p>Today, I heard my sister masturbating in her room. I took the dog around the block to get out of the house, and I came back to see her leaving her room… my electric toothbrush in her hand. FML</p>
