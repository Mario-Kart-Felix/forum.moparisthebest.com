<p>You should not make a thread advertising your server here…unfortunately you cannot do that anymore here. But you can use this page: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php</a>  , better ones like <a href="http://www.google.com/status/index.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.google.com/status/index.php</a> ( found on rune locus, not sure why it is changing it to google…) …I am not sure of others ones.</p>
<p>Mediafire:<br>
I could not upload the images I had due to school computer uploading bug…so I will just explain it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the green button that says upload to mediafire without an account</li>
<li>Select file you want.</li>
<li>Click begin uploading files</li>
<li>Should give you a link to your file so people can have a link for download of your files.<br>
If you get stuck there…give me a print screen of your screen. The school computers just say ‘upload stalled’ at that point so…</li>
</ol>
