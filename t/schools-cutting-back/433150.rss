    <description>They are cutting all JV and middle school sports + cutting back on transportation to special programs. Anyone else experiencing this in their school system?

It seems our President has affected us with the “rising health care costs”, note it was the first reason listed.  The national debt of the nation kills any possible increase towards the education system, which are government based and a national law. The states need to pick up the slack but they cannot because the economy is sour. So the local government needs to pick up the slack which it can’t because the economy is sour, so the only thing left is the resident and businesses who pay taxes, somehow they have the money even though the economy is sour.</description>

<p>Public education is much cheaper than national health care. Health care is a life time thing, public school is just 12 years. Why doesn’t the government pay for college? That way everyone can get the same education.[/quote]<br>
Public education utilized by most Americans age 4 - 18 and is offered all but 3 months of the year. Health care would be used at times of being sick or in need of procedures (which is often much less frequent than the amount of time spent in school). The government does pay for (a portion) certain universities (see state universities). University education isn’t a right (at least in my many others’ opinion since it’s specialize study) - primary schooling is a right since it’s an access to broad, equal education opportunities.</p>
<p>ps: America has the money, it’s just a matter of how the budget is allocated. a large chunk of it is given to DOD.</p>
<p>Oh, but we need this amount of military spending or else we’ll get behind!!! Oh wai-<br>

<p>pps: America already has a piss-poor social healthcare program known as medicare and unfortunately due to the population of elderly being &gt; the current population (see: baby boom), it is a huge expenditure.</p>

<p>decent public healthcare system means the general population are healthier which is better for the economy, treatment in the uk costs less per patient than the us per patient for example</p>

<p>True. It’s hard to argue with that logic. My parents are hard workers and they believe that you should work for everything. You shouldn’t receive handouts for something you did not earn.</p>
<p>I believe in laissez faire, but I also believe the government needs to regulate some things. The key to a great economy is finding that perfect balance. That balance, in my opinion, has been lost with national health care. The only thing the government needs to control is national security.</p>

What’s the point of arguing this? Health care has passed and I should shut up about it. Since we have national health care things should be getting better. That’s what Obama said and that’s what many liberals have said for the past couple of years. We just need to wait…<br>
[/quote]Except he implemented it poorly and didnt take the state of the economy into mind, you can’t have low taxes AND good social services.[/quote]</p>
<p>He wants higher taxes, people don’t want higher taxes. So what does he do? He targets education in hopes the parents realize education or higher taxes, hence, national health care caused my school system’s budget cuts. It’s Obama’s fault. He is the president and the blame falls on him.</p>
