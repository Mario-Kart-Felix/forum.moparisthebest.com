    <title>RuneScape Dialogues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-dialogues/437980</link>
    <description>I&#39;m requesting users to go into the game and talk with random NPC&#39;s, and to record the dialogues. I&#39;m talking about dialogues with any NPC, located anywhere. For example: Baraek within RuneScape&#39;s Varrock SQ. Please do try to steer clear of quest specific NPC&#39;s though. I prefer ones like waiters, lone merchants, etc.

NPC - dialogue here
PLAYER - dialogue here
OPTION - dialogues here
Then dialogues after OPTION to be marked with a corresponding number so I know which goes with which.

I will help to contribute to this thread as well as long as I see some effort being put forth.

EDIT: 


&lt;blockquote&gt;OPTION1: &quot;Can you sell me some furs?&quot; and &quot;Hello. I am in search of a quest.&quot;
PLAYER1: &quot;Hello! I am in search of a quest.&quot; goes with option two of OPTION1.
NPC1: &quot;Sorry kiddo, I&#39;m a fur trader not a damsel in distress.&quot; goes with PLAYER1.
PLAYER2: &quot;Can you sell me some furs?&quot; goes with option one of OPTION1.
NPC2: &quot;Yeah, sure. They&#39;re 20 gold coins each.&quot; goes with PLAYER2.
OPTION2: &quot;Yeah, okay, here you go.&quot; and &quot;20 gold coins? That&#39;s an outrage!&quot;
PLAYER3: &quot;20 gold coins? That&#39;s an outrage!&quot; goes with option one of OPTION2.
NPC3: &quot;Well, my best price is 18 coins.&quot; goes with the PLAYER3.
OPTION3: &quot;OK, here you go.&quot; and &quot;No thanks, I&#39;ll leave it.&quot; goes with NPC3.
PLAYER4: &quot;OK, here you go.&quot; goes with option one of OPTION3.
PLAYER5: &quot;No thanks, I&#39;ll leave it.&quot; goes with option two of OPTION3.
PLAYER6: &quot;OK, here you go.&quot; goes with option one of OPTION2.

GAME: &quot;Baraek sells you a fur.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I know that was rather confusing, I would write this in a switch statement, but the sectional rules say no runescape private server discussion and I didn&#39;t know if that would count :/</description>

<p>I won’t lie, I’m ignorant when it comes to anything like this. I Google’d a few bots but the only legitimate ones I came across were Simba, Robotz in Disguise, and thankfully RareBot. Simba is horribly designed in my opinion and it would take ages in order to create a script possible of doing everything I need with it, robotz in disguise doesn’t allow user-submitted scripts, but RareBot is just what I need. Nonetheless for this I will still need membership, and I’ll have to learn a lot more about RuneScape in order to make a bot capable of venturing around. There are still flaws with this though because there are areas that require levels, items, or quests to be completed in order to gain access to that area. This will mean I’ll have to spend months (not an exaggeration, I hate RuneScape and it would probably take me months if not a year to train an account capable of this) on requirements. Also, I know I could do it if I just set my mind to it, but I just don’t have the determination to go through all of that. I just don’t think a bot will be the best solution to this problem honestly. I’m going to stick to FTP dialogues for now and hopefully someone will contribute later on towards my PTP stash.</p>

<p>I’m sorry if I came off as rude as well, I didn’t mean too, I was just irritated with the outcome of this thread thus far. Anyways, I don’t have any specific NPC’s, as my goal is to recreate all of RuneScape, although I know that’s a daunting task and so I’ll probably focus on the main cities for the first few months; until I expand outwards and do the lesser known areas. I will disagree with that last part as every addition to a server is content and I would argue that’s not useless.</p>

              <p>I’m requesting users to go into the game and talk with random NPC’s, and to record the dialogues. I’m talking about dialogues with any NPC, located anywhere. For example: Baraek within RuneScape’s Varrock SQ. Please do try to steer clear of quest specific NPC’s though. I prefer ones like waiters, lone merchants, etc.</p>
<p>NPC - dialogue here<br>
PLAYER - dialogue here<br>
OPTION - dialogues here<br>
Then dialogues after OPTION to be marked with a corresponding number so I know which goes with which.</p>
<p>I will help to contribute to this thread as well as long as I see some effort being put forth.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<blockquote>OPTION1: "Can you sell me some furs?" and "Hello. I am in search of a quest."
PLAYER1: "Hello! I am in search of a quest." goes with option two of OPTION1.
NPC1: "Sorry kiddo, I'm a fur trader not a damsel in distress." goes with PLAYER1.
PLAYER2: "Can you sell me some furs?" goes with option one of OPTION1.
NPC2: "Yeah, sure. They're 20 gold coins each." goes with PLAYER2.
OPTION2: "Yeah, okay, here you go." and "20 gold coins? That's an outrage!"
PLAYER3: "20 gold coins? That's an outrage!" goes with option one of OPTION2.
NPC3: "Well, my best price is 18 coins." goes with the PLAYER3.
OPTION3: "OK, here you go." and "No thanks, I'll leave it." goes with NPC3.
PLAYER4: "OK, here you go." goes with option one of OPTION3.
PLAYER5: "No thanks, I'll leave it." goes with option two of OPTION3.
PLAYER6: "OK, here you go." goes with option one of OPTION2.
<p>GAME: “Baraek sells you a fur.”</p>

I know that was rather confusing, I would write this in a switch statement, but the sectional rules say no runescape private server discussion and I didn’t know if that would count <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">
