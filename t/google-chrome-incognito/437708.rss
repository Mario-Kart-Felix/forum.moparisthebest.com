    <description>Well at my school people use Incognito to not be found browsing and stuff at school, the IT guy can check the history and stuff from Incognito. How can I save myself and delete all that history?</description>

              <p>on those pc’s with bios locks is it possible to open them up? at my hs they had some computers(cheap suse pcs) that where obscured from the teachers vision. that had screws you could unscrew with your fingers. if so you could remove the cmos battery or hitting a reset button on the mobo. I screwed one of those computers up. it sucked i never got in trouble for it though, kinda felt bad b/c the teacher know i was messing with it and i was going to show her how i could get windows xp to run on it yet still have suse installed(qemu); it(the vm) worked well but how i messed it up was i replaced system files from one os(suse) with another’s(puppylinux). the good then was it was about summer so it wasn’t unusable for too long.</p>
<p>the teamviewer solution sounds like the best. bypassing the keylogger you could simply vary the methods of typing the last half(of the password or what ever word you dont want the keylogger to catch correctly) - the last letter go back to the beginning type the first half - the first letter, then go to the end and place the last letter, finally type the first letter. or use the OSK on your home computer(or whichever computer you are tving).</p>
<p>I was also thinking someone could make a program on your tving computer that reads cryptic keystokes then outputs the correct keystokes(e.g. you physically type like you were using a dvorak keyboard, then the program converts and outputs qwerty. probably be hard to get used to but probably the most effective unless they figured out what was going on. lol they would be like wtf this kid is typing gibberish).</p>
<p>edit: <a class="mention" href="/u/skyro">@skyro</a> last year(or 2) my highschool gave(i should say leased; but they get to use them till senior year if they pay the annual price, and get to keep them if they want to pay it off) laptops(i think they may actually be netbooks) to all the freshmen and all the upperclassmen and alumni(which was/i am) were like wtf why didnt we get laptops(but i heard that some teachers let upperclassmen can bring they own laptops in and use). also the year b4 that they school constructed a whole new section to the school just for freshmen.</p>

For me, everything is keylogged, and at the beginning of school you have to sigh an agreement that basically says “We, the district, have rights to access any of the information you put into our computers if needed: Including passwords, usernames, sent emails. etc.” Just to use the internet.</p>

The IT guy at my school has like a 6-pack and is strong as fuck. And he is an amazing hacker. Idk why he has a shit job at my school.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t know why hackers are cool!!, hacking doesn’t mean you have great programming abilities, at my uni it is encouraged, although we are asked to find exploits and report them, few of my classmates have gotten certificates from google and Microsoft for finding exploits and they hire alot of us, every year.</p>

              <p>What I do is run Fedora on a VM. Then I put the connection to bridged and make myself part of the LAN. Since this is a VM on bridged it has it’s own local IP and the IT guy can’t figure out where the connection is coming from. It basically looks like some 3rd party foreign computer is connected to the LAN, when it’s really a VM running on my machine.</p>
<p>Then, I just retrieve all the hosts in the LAN with Fedora (through ettercap), you can also do the same with Cain &amp; Abel on Windows and then I try to figure out which host is the IT guy’s computer, this is fairly simple because our PCs are labeled so when I resolve the host names from the IPs I can easily tell which one is the IT guy. After I figured that out, I just perform a MITM attack (ARP poisoning) and then DoS the shit out of him. This pretty much fucks up his network connection and he can no longer do check-ups. It’s funny, sometimes I just kill the whole school network (e.g. when we have to do exercises on the WWW), then people start to whine and blame it on the ISP. I’m so cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, all incognito does is prevent saving data on YOUR computer. All internet activity goes through the router and switch first and since he is the IT guy he pretty much has the ability to log all the packets flowing through your LAN.</p>
<p>So what you can do is kick him out of the LAN, do your thing, then put him back in. Of course, later on, if he saves logs of all the internet data, he’ll be able to view all sites you visited.</p>

IT people who’re not at large companies, and especially those at schools, are notoriously retarded. If you can connect over SSH (or even another port, really), you’ll be set.<br>
[/quote]to do what exactly</p>
<p>i think you miss OP’s point</p>
<p>OT -  I think you’re looking at this the wrong way. The most likely way he is looking at your history isn’t actually your browser history at all, but the connections made through the schools network from the computer. (They look at the computer and see who was logged in at that time)</p>
<p>You can’t ‘delete’ this information, at least not with student permissions, so your best bet is to cross your fingers and avoid normal means of accessing these ‘blocked’ sites. Some other ways to view them could be to access them via another webpage that doesn’t connect to the actual url, but still sends you the data (basically a proxy). Another way could be to use something like teamviewer (lol) to connect to your home computer and do whatever you want, as that’s completely hidden unless they screencap your sessions.[/quote]<br>
-D argument for GNU SSH starts a local proxy server. Putty can do the same thing. Alternatively you could forward X (assuming you’ve got X server running on the machine you want to browse on). ALTERNATIVELY, YOU COULD USE LYNX LOL</p>
