    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/packet-editing-from-client-to-server/371575</link>
    <description>hay guys. is there a way to use a Packet editor to edit the packets sent from the client to the server to be able to edit them and be able to do what ever you want.

im cureous because of the program &quot;AutoRune&quot; which was developed back in RSC and i was wondering if you could do the same thing on RSPS&#39;s with packet editors.

if it can be done please can you give me a short TUT on how to do it, :D thnx</description>
