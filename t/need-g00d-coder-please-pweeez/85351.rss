    <description>Hey, I Need a coder who can spare me probbly about 10-60Mins..[Not sure how long as i&#39;m a rubbish coder]
Well..Heres a few things i would like you to do..If possible. :)

[b][i]This Server is Adventurescape..Hope that&#39;s not a problem..[/i][/b]

-Make lvl-ing Slower..Because when you attack a monster for example. Your attack/defence/str/hit-Pionts go up [b][i]REALLY[i][/b] Fast..If you could change ths so it&#39;s a lil&#39;Bit harder that would be [b]great![/b]

-[i]maybe[/i] Fix Some Stuff like..Bugs? Anythin&#39; yooh think shouldn&#39;t be there.

-Oh and..I Would like to make myself a admin/Owner on it[Dunno how to do it..I know..Noobie...]
My user [i]Will[/i] be xB L A D Ex in the server.

-I dunno if it&#39;s possible..but...Yooh know when yooh 1st start playin&#39; the server as a [i]new[/i] Character you start with armour like dragon and all that..Could yooh possibly change it to just .. Full Bronze, Str ammy and bronze scimmy? `n&#39; When yooh first start yooh get to choose what your character looks like. Like normal runescape - That would be great!!

-Every time i advertise or somethin&#39; The people who help me Will [b]Allways be in the credits for great help[/b]
-And i dunno what else..Maybe yooh can like decide to change somthin&#39; And ask? ;)



P.S This is ALOT of coding..Some people might just think i&#39;m takin&#39; advantage of good coders..I&#39;m not im askin&#39; Nicley for some help so i can make a good server for people to have fun and a great time on,[i]Breaks between revising, Homework?[/i] :rolleyes: ;)


-Thank Yooh So Much For Your Time To Read This &amp;&amp; I Hope Someone Wil Help And Spare Some Time.



- xB L A D Ex -


[size=20pt]I&#39;ll Be extremly happy for your help and you will have all the credits[/size] :)
