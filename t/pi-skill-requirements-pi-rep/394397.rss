    <title>[PI] Skill Requirements [PI] Rep++</title>

    <description>Hey everyone.
Was playing my server as a skiller, and was thinking of ways i could promote skilling. So, I&#39;ve Decided to create a skilling Area, with the Requirements of 99 Firemaking, Woodcutting, and Farming, that could be accessed by an object. I&#39;ve been browsing through my client class, and couldnt find anything that had to do with a requirement of such. and have come here for help.
Would anyone mind sharing that with me?
Thanks :)</description>
