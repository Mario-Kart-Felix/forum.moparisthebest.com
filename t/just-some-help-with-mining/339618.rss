    <description>Hey guys, I just had a question about Mining for 317&#39;s. If you could help in anyway, please do. Well, I would just like to know how to make it so, when i mine an ore on my server, it doesn&#39;t continue to mine, but rather stops, and the ore turns to a grey rock (like runescape). Then how to add a delay to it before it turns back to it&#39;s original ore. If you could help me with any part of this, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</description>

2 errors
Press any key to continue . . .</code></p>
<p>and also, you wrote “switchObjectID”, and talked about typing in the rocks/ores. but in your other post u didn’t have that there, you just had “additem(xxxx, etc.)” do you want me to put that there…? you’re kinda talkin about two different things.</p>

              <p>You add it with whatever initializes your mining method. I’m not sure what your mining method looks like so I’m not going to really say where to put it. I’m sure you could figure it out though.</p>
<p>As for the xxxx’s<br>
when it replaces an object, it should replace the object you are clicking on.<br>
Ex:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">replaceObject(objectX, objectY, blankRockID, 0, 10, 0);</code></pre>
<p>I forget if there’s another 0 in replaceObject or not.</p>
<p>As for getting ore IDs<br>
You should do it like this</p>
<p><code>switch(objectID) {
	case BronzeRockID:
		return bronzeOre;
	case IronRockID:
		return ironOre;
	case CoalRockID:
		return coal;
}</code></p>

              <p>Do i need to put this in multiple times, like after every of my mining codes, or just once at beginning or end? and for the “xxxx”'s, does it want me to put ALL the object id’s once, and then ALL the item ore id’s once? j/w. Thanks a lot btw.</p>

              <p>Well, no offence to you, but I am aware you’re not here to spoonfeed me. And I don’t need spoon feeding, trust me. I would just like some assistance as to the code or however you would just add a delay and switch the rock id. I can do the rest on my own (which i have actually done already). And if you do know how, instead of just saying that you’re not here to help, why not just tell me what to do and be of some assistance?

<p>No offense, but where not here to spoon feed.<br>
Look after something else?<br>
Perhaps tutorials, or even simple java tutorials somewhere, and then figure out how to use it.<br>
As you will be using that ALOT later on.</p>

<p>have the object give the exp, and ore. then set it to change the object for say- 5-6 seconds to the grey one. Then after that it switches back.</p>
