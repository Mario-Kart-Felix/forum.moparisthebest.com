    <title>Few Demise Source [ Delta ] problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-demise-source-delta-problems/367685</link>
    <description>1. Character file resets every time i run the server ( deltes existing file and creates a blank character file )
2. There was a command to add pkpoints, but i changed it to add a different thing in the character file as the pkpoints didnt do anything, i suppose it was anti-leech, so this is what the command is: [code]if(command.startsWith(&quot;givekills&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 3)) {
String name = command.substring(8);
try {
int p = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(name);
client c = (client) server.playerHandler.players[p];
c.wincount += 100;
updateText();
c.sM(&quot;You recieve 100 kills. Gratz.&quot;);
} catch(Exception e) {
sM(name+&quot; either isn&#39;t online or doesn&#39;t exist&quot;);
}
}[/code] and heres the error:
client.java:7873: cannot find symbol
symbol : variable wincount
location: class client 
c.wincount +=100
  ^
It used to say pkpoints where wincount is, i just switched it.
The problem seems to be the &quot;.&quot;, but that worked before?
3. How do i make it so an item cannot be picked up?</description>
