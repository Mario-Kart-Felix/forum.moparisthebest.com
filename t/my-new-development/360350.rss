    <description>Hey guys since i just released my little edits from demisepking v5 giving the right amount of credits with it, people liked it and said it was not bad for a beginner. So what i am now going to do is go a step further. Im going to use a cleaned version of deltascape which was provided by Chozen Pkz. 

By doing this I hope to enhance my skill in creating servers since I only know very basic stuff. I will release everything I do so i get some views and feedback on how im doing.

There is alo a small request I am going to ask here as well. If anyone knows a lot of delta coding please PM me your email address so you can help me out with my development and teach me. Don&#39;t worry I will give you credits for when i release :P

              <p>Good luck.<br>
I would not suggest Delta, but I just started a new project with Delta so I cannot say that.</p>
