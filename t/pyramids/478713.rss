    <description>how is it that two different contents have pyramids on them?

that would either mean the races on those continents had contact. (no proof)

or the races on those continents were visited by other beings (we do have proof, they are referred as gods, but we can call them aliens)

or as noobs are ftw stated they were simply smarter than us, most archaeologists do disagrees on that though. (since there is no technology left over, or stated in history apparently ) but that is one of the possible conclusions and valid theory in my opinion

thoughts?

any different logical theorys for this? or what?</description>

<p>the total weight of the PYRAMIDS AT GIZA would be in the region of 6.5 MILLION tonnes, one tonne is 1000kg which weighs less than your freaking car, THERE IS NO WAY the pyramids AT GIZA weigh less than 30~ average cars</p>
<p>and again I am NOT saying the pyramids OF GIZA weren’t hard to build, I’m saying they’re not complex relative to any modern building today, you SIMPLY CANNOT build a skyscraper without good quality steel, good quality concrete and good planning, all that is required to build a pyramid is that you stack (heavy) blocks of solid stone on top of each other until you get a point</p>

<p>I’m not saying your right or wrong, or that Rome was made by aliens, but assuming that those pyramids are over 30 tons, you have to wonder how a population of under 7 million (probably much less) made all those Pyramids with the given amount of time &amp; I’m sure that Niall would agree not everyone in those times was a skilled sculptor.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>you don’t have to be a sculptor to build pyramids, the pyramids AT GIZA are NOT solid objects, they are composed of an estimated 2.3 MILLION solid limestone blocks (along with some mortar and granite blocks)</p>
<p>the limestone blocks were mined from nearby quarries, limestone is relatively soft and doesn’t require any special methods to mine that the egyptians didn’t have available to (copper and bronze tools), granite however is very difficult to mine with copper and bronze tools but we know how they mined it, if you place sand on the granite (hint: egypt has lots of sand) and start sawing the granite with a copper saw you’ll quickly find that because the sand is tougher than granite you’ll be able to cut through granite with relative ease, another example would have been drilling holes into the granite along a line (also with sand) and putting wooden wedges in the holes, if you then get that wood wet it will expand and crack the granite, both of these examples have been tested and shown to work, and the second method is known to have been used because we have physical proof of this</p>
<p>the granite blocks weren’t mined at the site of the pyramids but at aswan instead (go look it up on a map), there actually was a river running up to the site of the pyramids so again, no special methods were used to transport 25-80 tonne blocks</p>
<p>as I linked to in the last post, building a pyramid wouldn’t have been unnecessarily complex, it would have however have required thousands of labourers (not slaves) and several years, it’s estimated that 5-10 thousand labourers built the main pyramid of giza in 15-20 years, and the giza complex as a whole in up to 80 years, 5-10 thousand labourers being fed well working for what they would have believed to be a demi-god over the course of 20 years would have been a HUGE operation that wasn’t going to be matched again for a good few centuries</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>in case it wasn’t blatantly loveing obvious in my post, the pyramids that are aligned near perfectly with a compass ARE THE PYRAMIDS AT GIZA AND THE PYRAMIDS AT GIZA ALONE, and as I stated in my post this would have been a much more technological advancement than cutting and placing blocks in an increasingly small square</p>
<p>the complex at giza would have taken 80~ years to build using thousands of skilled labourers being fed well, the main pyramid of giza would have likely taken 15-20 years to build with a workforce of 5-10 thousand, it took mankind a mere 65 years to go from it’s first ever flight to leaving loveing earth and landing on the loveing moon</p>

<p>where’s the resemblance other than they’re all pyramid-esque in shape?</p>
<p>of course, not even the other pyramids of egypt look like the pyramids in americas, the closest example of an egyptian pyramid looking like an american pyramid would be the ‘step pyramid’ of djoser, as seen here</p>

<p>Egyptians were intelligent people, they discovered a lot of things so i doubt it would be difficult to say that with their studies they weren’t able to figure out direction. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, how do you know they didn’t build the pyramids at all 4 points so that the sun could reflect off each effectively during different parts of the day? There are too many theories that have little chance of being proven, maybe instead of questions that cannot be answered, you should just accept that they knew things we don’t.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not saying your right or wrong, or that Rome was made by aliens, but assuming that those pyramids are over 30 tons, you have to wonder how a population of under 7 million (probably much less) made all those Pyramids with the given amount of time &amp; I’m sure that Niall would agree not everyone in those times was a skilled sculptor. Yet they built multiple Pyramids that were </p><blockquote>ALMOST perfectly align to north, east, south and west within 3 degrees of being perfectly aligned to the compass points</blockquote> in different regions of the world. Then you have to think about how long it would take someone in those times to get from the Pyramids of Giza to the American ones yet they have similar designs. There are lots of things to consider, and you shouldn’t be so quick to judge just because someone else’s beliefs don’t support your own. On top of that some of these Pyramids were made in the middle of the desert &amp; and if you’ve ever been to desert ( which I haven’t ) I’m also assuming those wouldn’t be the ideal construction environment especially with the technology at hand.

<p>herp derp civilizations around the world have all made cube shape structures that they reside in, GIVE ME THEORIES ON HOW THEY DID IT GOD DAMNIT</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>sorry sir, but pyramids are not different. You have the same type of pyramids, yes even those less pointy ones in egypt. its not all about the big gizah pyramid you know. An easy gemetrical shape? NO. These buildings are complex build. </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>repeat after me: THE PYRAMIDS AT GIZA ARE NOT COMPLEX BUILDINGS, the pyramids at giza are relatively simple to build but they required a loveing ton of manual labour, by today’s standards it would be easier for an average person to design and build a pyramid than to design and build a modern house</p>
<p>if you want to talk about the pyramids of giza being special then talk about how they ALMOST perfectly align to north, east, south and west because that is a lot more complicated to do than building a SIMPLE pyramid structure, if I recall the pyramids are within 3 degrees of being perfectly aligned to the compass points</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>^ First of all, pyramids are complex build structures. They are not simple grain of sand put together. Second of all, the same type of buildings on two different continents. And im not just talking about egypt and native americans. I’m talking about all over the world.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>like I’ve said already, pyramids are NOT COMPLEX TO BUILD, <a href="http://www.world-mysteries.com/mpl_2_1plane.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this is a demonstration of how the pyramids of giza were built</a>, it is not the exact build but if you were to build a pyramid this is how you would go about it</p>
<p>of course we don’t actually know how the pyramids were built for 100% certainty but we can speculate that the above url wouldn’t be far off and would be EASILY within the technological limits of the ancient egyptians, we also know that slaves DID NOT BUILD THE PYRAMIDS, skilled labourers built the pyramids and we have physical evidence of this</p>
<p><img src="http://www.world-mysteries.com/ramp1.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>this is another ‘theory’ as to how they built and dealt with the ramp issue, the ramps would have been composed of dirt and wood which in comparison to the solid limestone blocks would have been easy to remove as they were coming down the pyramids when it was finish</p>
<p>for the love of loveing god I learned the basics of how the pyramids were built in school when I was 6, 14 years later I am now attempting to educate you on how simple the pyramids would have been to build, do me a favour and go pick up a loveing book before you call the pyramids complex structures</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>You do not think structures that can stand for thousand of years are complex?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>the important thing to loveing note here is that THE PYRAMIDS AT GIZA HAVEN’T STOOD FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, at least not stood without damage, in case you don’t know the pyramids of giza used to have a white limestone shell that was knocked off in an earthquake which the modern egyptians stole for use on houses in cairo</p>
<p>you can still see the white limestone on the top of one of the pyramids here:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.hotelclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pyramid_of_giza.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>the pyramids of giza were said to be a white star in the desert (paraphrasing) because the white limestone casing would have shined like a mirror in the desert sun, realistically this is what the pyramids used to look like:</p>
<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vOC4UimT0Cg/T_wO6MVhlpI/AAAAAAAAAL4/3dstuhlvOhU/s1600/Giza01.jpg" alt width="546" height="410"></p>
<p>yes, the pyramids of giza are still technically standing but over the few thousand years since they were built they have taken substantial damage and have lost their limestone casing, I have actually been inside the pyramids of giza and there are a great deal amount of cracks on the granite rocks inside, they are not in pristine condition</p>
<p>of course an important thing to loveing note is one of the reasons that the pyramids stood so long is the geographical location and environment and not just the nature and materials of the structure, the pyramids at giza are built in a freaking desert with no rain for most of the year and the only real thing that has damaged the pyramids is erosion and earthquakes, in comparison smaller more common buildings such as houses and roads can literally get washed away in flash floods</p>
<p>the stone henge for instance is a structure that has survived for comparably as long as the pyramids and the one thing you’ll notice they both have in common IS THAT THEY’RE BOTH MADE OUT OF SOLID loveING ROCK AND HAVE BRICKS THAT WEIGH SEVERAL TONNES EACH</p>
<p>I want to stress how big the pyramid actually is, the pyramid is composed of smaller solid limestone blocks and larger solid granite blocks in the burial chamber, when I say that the limestone blocks are small what I really mean is they’re larger than a metre squared, see below:</p>
<p><img src="http://sacredsites.com/africa/egypt/images/building-blocks-great-pyramid-500.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>and to put the actual size into perspective:</p>
<p><a href="http://c1038.r38.cf3.rackcdn.com/group1/building1161/media/media_26852.jpg" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://c1038.r38.cf3.rackcdn.com/group1/building1161/media/media_26852.jpg</a></p>
<p>so no, to recap the pyramids aren’t complex to build but they would have required YEARS of effort from skilled labourers, the blocks were made of solid loveing limestone and solid loveing granite, the granite blocks weighing in a region of 25 to 80 tonnes EACH, coupled with the fact that the only natural damage they would occur is through erosion and sandstone = the capability to stand for thousands of years</p>
<p>of course I’ve primarily talked about the pyramids of giza in egypt, much of what I said is applicable to the pyramids in south america, they are large structures composed of stone, they’re not going to be washed away in a flood and they’re not going to take substantial damage from earthquakes, the key difference here is of course that the pyramids of giza kill people tourists who climb and fall on them, while <a href="http://www.infowars.com/mayan-apocalypse-results-in-damaged-pyramid-caused-by-tourists/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> the pyramids of guatamala are ‘irreversibly’ damaged by tourists climbing the steps</a></p>
<p>fun fact, modern buildings built up to spec to resist earthquakes could likely also survive thousands of years if placed in a desert or a location where no flash flood is going to destroy them[/quote]</p>
<p>Making a 30 ton Pyramid in the middle of the desert with compass-like features using rocks, that wasn’t hard or anything.</p>

<p>sorry sir, but pyramids are not different. You have the same type of pyramids, yes even those less pointy ones in egypt. its not all about the big gizah pyramid you know. An easy gemetrical shape? NO. These buildings are complex build.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>repeat after me: THE PYRAMIDS AT GIZA ARE NOT COMPLEX BUILDINGS, the pyramids at giza are relatively simple to build but they required a fucking ton of manual labour, by today’s standards it would be easier for an average person to design and build a pyramid than to design and build a modern house</p>
<p>if you want to talk about the pyramids of giza being special then talk about how they ALMOST perfectly align to north, east, south and west because that is a lot more complicated to do than building a SIMPLE pyramid structure, if I recall the pyramids are within 3 degrees of being perfectly aligned to the compass points</p>

</aside>
<p>like I’ve said already, pyramids are NOT COMPLEX TO BUILD, <a href="http://www.world-mysteries.com/mpl_2_1plane.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this is a demonstration of how the pyramids of giza were built</a>, it is not the exact build but if you were to build a pyramid this is how you would go about it</p>
<p>of course we don’t actually know how the pyramids were built for 100% certainty but we can speculate that the above url wouldn’t be far off and would be EASILY within the technological limits of the ancient egyptians, we also know that slaves DID NOT BUILD THE PYRAMIDS, skilled labourers built the pyramids and we have physical evidence of this</p>
<p><img src="http://www.world-mysteries.com/ramp1.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>this is another ‘theory’ as to how they built and dealt with the ramp issue, the ramps would have been composed of dirt and wood which in comparison to the solid limestone blocks would have been easy to remove as they were coming down the pyramids when it was finish</p>
<p>for the love of fucking god I learned the basics of how the pyramids were built in school when I was 6, 14 years later I am now attempting to educate you on how simple the pyramids would have been to build, do me a favour and go pick up a fucking book before you call the pyramids complex structures</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You do not think structures that can stand for thousand of years are complex?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>the important thing to fucking note here is that THE PYRAMIDS AT GIZA HAVEN’T STOOD FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, at least not stood without damage, in case you don’t know the pyramids of giza used to have a white limestone shell that was knocked off in an earthquake which the modern egyptians stole for use on houses in cairo</p>
<p>you can still see the white limestone on the top of one of the pyramids here:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.hotelclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pyramid_of_giza.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>the pyramids of giza were said to be a white star in the desert (paraphrasing) because the white limestone casing would have shined like a mirror in the desert sun, realistically this is what the pyramids used to look like:</p>
<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vOC4UimT0Cg/T_wO6MVhlpI/AAAAAAAAAL4/3dstuhlvOhU/s1600/Giza01.jpg" alt width="546" height="410"></p>
<p>yes, the pyramids of giza are still technically standing but over the few thousand years since they were built they have taken substantial damage and have lost their limestone casing, I have actually been inside the pyramids of giza and there are a great deal amount of cracks on the granite rocks inside, they are not in pristine condition</p>
<p>of course an important thing to fucking note is one of the reasons that the pyramids stood so long is the geographical location and environment and not just the nature and materials of the structure, the pyramids at giza are built in a freaking desert with no rain for most of the year and the only real thing that has damaged the pyramids is erosion and earthquakes, in comparison smaller more common buildings such as houses and roads can literally get washed away in flash floods</p>
<p>the stone henge for instance is a structure that has survived for comparably as long as the pyramids and the one thing you’ll notice they both have in common IS THAT THEY’RE BOTH MADE OUT OF SOLID FUCKING ROCK AND HAVE BRICKS THAT WEIGH SEVERAL TONNES EACH</p>
<p>I want to stress how big the pyramid actually is, the pyramid is composed of smaller solid limestone blocks and larger solid granite blocks in the burial chamber, when I say that the limestone blocks are small what I really mean is they’re larger than a metre squared, see below:</p>
<p><img src="http://sacredsites.com/africa/egypt/images/building-blocks-great-pyramid-500.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>and to put the actual size into perspective:</p>
<p><a href="http://c1038.r38.cf3.rackcdn.com/group1/building1161/media/media_26852.jpg" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://c1038.r38.cf3.rackcdn.com/group1/building1161/media/media_26852.jpg</a></p>
<p>so no, to recap the pyramids aren’t complex to build but they would have required YEARS of effort from skilled labourers, the blocks were made of solid fucking limestone and solid fucking granite, the granite blocks weighing in a region of 25 to 80 tonnes EACH, coupled with the fact that the only natural damage they would occur is through erosion and sandstone = the capability to stand for thousands of years</p>
<p>of course I’ve primarily talked about the pyramids of giza in egypt, much of what I said is applicable to the pyramids in south america, they are large structures composed of stone, they’re not going to be washed away in a flood and they’re not going to take substantial damage from earthquakes, the key difference here is of course that the pyramids of giza kill people tourists who climb and fall on them, while <a href="http://www.infowars.com/mayan-apocalypse-results-in-damaged-pyramid-caused-by-tourists/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> the pyramids of guatamala are ‘irreversibly’ damaged by tourists climbing the steps</a></p>
<p>fun fact, modern buildings built up to spec to resist earthquakes could likely also survive thousands of years if placed in a desert or a location where no flash flood is going to destroy them</p>

Stone Henge is an awesome example. Complexity doesn’t equate to durability, and if anything, they almost seem to cancel each other out, unless done properly.</p>
