    <title>Favor please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/favor-please/7467</link>
    <description>Well I downloaded MoparScape but I can&#39;t find any websites that work that give me item IDs and when I get an item like a Torag Body (was expirementing) I tried to wear it and I could still see my Green Shirt under it should it wouldn&#39;t work with whatever I wear so I have a favor for someone.

Will someone spawn:

Ahrims Hood
Obby Cape
Kharils Body
Ahrims Skirt
Fury Ammy
Climbing Boots
Cooking Guants
Whip
Obby Shield

Could you spawn them and wear them then just take a picture and post it on here for me?

Thanks in advance.</description>
