              <p>well i never thought anyone would acuse me of being fake, but i wanted him to log on and not just see that he is banned… but that he has to start over… also he is muted but that was before i got on their, he had full zombie, full mime, he didnt have any cash, i beleive someone else hacked him before (thats prob how my mate knows his pass) dont ask me though, they go to school together.</p>
