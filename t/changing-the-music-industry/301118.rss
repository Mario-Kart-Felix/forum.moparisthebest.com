    <title>Changing the Music Industry?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-music-industry/301118</link>
    <description>Blink 182 Guitarists and Vocalists Tom Delonge Shocked blink fans across the world in February 2005 by ending the band blink 182. The reason he decided to call it quits is because he simply didnt want to do it anymore. Tom Delonge wanted to mature with his music, he wanted to do something different with music (he didnt want to be immature talking about fucking dogs). He actually wanted his music to make a impact, so he started a new band AVA (angels and airwaves), made a website (modlife). Why he did this I kept wondering, What is in this guys head? Im a big fan of tom myself so I decided to dig a little deeper into this mystery. 

Tom Delonge after breaking up with the band walked into a studio and said &quot;I want to change how music is made, I want to change how its produced, I want to change the music industry&quot;. People did not take him seriously, they were like arent you the guy in that band  who runs around naked? After creating his new band and releasing 2 albums Tom is Finally getting his respect. Angels and Airwaves will be releasing a album called &quot;love&quot; on valentines day this upcoming year and also releasing a movie as well. This will be the first ever movie released by a band. 


The interview below is brilliant. I personally thought he wasnt this smart.

What is your guys thoughts? Do you believe music will actually be like this ? (in the interview)</description>

Nine Inch Nails is another band that’s against the way the music industry currently operates, although with respect to their pricing. Trent Reznor told people to steal the Year Zero album because he was disgusted with how much the Universal Music Group was charging for it.</p>

The only channels that I I can watch without directly paying someone for it are public channels, which are funded by the government. And hey, where does the government get their money from?<br>

<p>I do. But some posts in this thread state that TV is free. Which isn’t the case.</p>

<p>This isnt about blink182. This is about tom delonge and his idea with the music industry how music shall be free (like tv). But bands will sell there merchandise (like u watch simpsons and u wanna go buy a simpsons shirt). He talks about how technology has a impact on music and how his goal is to change the way music is marketed.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/goatee">@goatee</a></p>
<p>Yes this will be the first movie from a band thats not a documentary or anything. Usually band movies are about the band, AVA however is taking a little different. Making a real movie.<br>
[/quote]<br>
since when is tv free?[/quote]</p>
<p>TV is use to be free, all you had to do was buy a television. Its like radio, you buy a radio and u listen to the stations u want. But for the future since people just dowload music illegally, music should just be handed out for free. But how will artists make it? They will using a website with membership, or selling there merch</p>
