    <description>So I was making a jar client last night and it wasn&#39;t working for me, but I just found a client.bat file that I didn&#39;t know about and it said it was made last night whenever I was doing my jarring, and it works, soo is this the jarred file or what? This is what the cmd says..

THIS BATCH IS FOR DEBUGGING THE EXECUTABLE JAR ONLY
DOUBLE-CLICK THE &quot;client.jar&quot; TO RUN IT
