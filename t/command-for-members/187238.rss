    <title>Command for members</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/command-for-members/187238</link>
    <description>I need a command that makes it to where everyone is a member.(e.g. - my server is used from project czar source and czar is member server thing)But i dont feel like going and clearing all that stuff and also i dont know how. So if anyone can think up or knows a code for a command that makes everyone member that would help out alot!

Thanks, ~dominate</description>
