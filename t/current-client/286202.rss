    <description>ok i know this probably isn&#39;t the right place but its about clients possibly to private servers. i was looking through the current rs client to compare and contrast between a 317 and the current client. and i found stuff about jagex&#39;s mechscape. it is in class gg string z. so i was wondering is there a way to get early access to mechscape? also i found stuff that looked like clipboard transfer code in their current client. and some more interesting stuff. i am a noob in clients atm right now i am trying to learn it and im getting better or i would try to find out myself. thx for reading and if you think this is spam then lock. just thought i would share info. in the attachments is the rs jar, the imported clipboard transfer api java file and the java file that contains mechscape is loading. if u need anything else ill try to get. sorry if it was a bad decompile i used jode i have popcorn deob stuff but not atm and idk how to really use. in the attachments is the deobed source code for the current runescape client zipped. i used popcorns deob stuff  so thx to who that is. to fix 2 of the 95 errors you must add plugin.jar(in jre\lib folder) to you classpath. someone better then me could fix the errors i know. if anyone gets it working and adds a way to get the mapdata from runescape i would help get the mapdata. or gets access to mechscape models idk if thats possible though.</description>

              <p>Theres an very easy way to try this…<br>
But all the mechscape (or stellerdawn) stuff is only the loader.<br>
in the cache theres also a foldert called stellerdawn</p>
<p>and to try it: Run a client with game1 and not game0 argument.<br>
it will show like its loading mechscape…</p>
