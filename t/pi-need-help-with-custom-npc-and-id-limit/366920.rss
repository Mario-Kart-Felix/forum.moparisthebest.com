    <title>[PI] Need help with Custom NPC and ID limit</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-help-with-custom-npc-and-id-limit/366920</link>
    <description>I just added a few custom NPCs or switched the NPCs ID. Like on the client side GWD NPCs were already in the client that came with PI, but I decided to switch the IDs around and the NPCs are not the GWD NPCs, but like guards and dwarfs... any idea? It may be server side, but I am not sure.

Original IDs where 25__, but I changed them to 62__. Any idea why its being stupid?</description>
