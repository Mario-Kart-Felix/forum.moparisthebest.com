    <title>Server up?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-up/540801</link>
    <description>So whats going on? I know there are 100&#39;s of posts but i just want a straight answer. This server was highly anticipated when the idea was first mentioned and if it is heavily advertised i&#39;m sure it can &#39;centralize the RSC community&#39;. There are 3 main servers out right now with 30 players each..</description>

<p>Actually that just summarizes pretty much all your server so far… “I could throw it up”.</p>
<p>Okay, my first reaction was maybe too harsh, but seriously, what do you want to accomplish? If you say “I can do that if you want” that’s weak. That just shows you are weak. Someone (sorry, I just don’t remember who you were) said that the problem is all the private servers are out there to “please everyone”. WTF?! Who thinks it is possible to please everyone?! That is just plain stupid. As that someone said if you want to make a successful private server, you have to follow your target, you can’t just think on half way what others want. If you have made your server structure clear enough for players, then it is easy to follow your path. If you start making changes you are just fucked up.</p>

it will never happen and the true base for RSC is already depleted.o<br>
[/quote]<br>
Depleted and dead are two different things, until this community is dead i see no reason why a server like mopar shouldn’t happen. We need to merge all players onto 1 world otherwise servers like the one you have in your signature will kill the rest of us off. Maybe i’m being too optimistic and a little naive, but i have faith in the coders of Mopar.[/quote]<br>
I know and it has a retarded name too. Anything with high exp rate isn’t worth playing IMO. I’d be down to advertise the crap out of a 1x server like I did Project RSC. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I’d pay for advertisement thats how much I want a 1x server. I ran the PRSC Facebook and Reddit before it died. I was gone for 8 months and shit hits the fan. uhg.</p>

</aside>
<p>Depleted and dead are two different things, until this community is dead i see no reason why a server like mopar shouldn’t happen. We need to merge all players onto 1 world otherwise servers like the one you have in your signature will kill the rest of us off. Maybe i’m being too optimistic and a little naive, but i have faith in the coders of Mopar.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:3, topic:540801”]No. It’s not. It’s highly anticipated when the idea was first mentioned by xEnt. Kryptix died then everyone jumped on ProjectRSC bandwagon. Which caused the initial delay of moparclassic for a year. There are 3 main servers out there right now with 30 players each because as soon as we even talk about launching there will be another one. (like RSCR has to launch as soon as I throw up a MoparClassic beta ) People just have it in their head that it’s a better plan to fly solo rather than put the community in the correct hands who has had rather good success administrating (MITB).</p>
<p>Which I don’t understand because if ProjectRSC was in MITBs hands it would still be up. Oh and lets not forget MITB had the beta server up for a year but only 3 people bothered to push the project.[/quote]<br>
Well then maybe it’s time for a fresh start? Does xEnt,MITB,Pets,codeforfame,and yourself still want/able to work on this project ? Maybe we can all regroup and make a new sticky or subsection in order to get some attention? Maybe release a clean Beta again after some advertisement and somewhat of a player/fan base is established?</p>
<p>I just feel that Moparforum is visited by most players in the RSC community and a RSC private server made and sponsored by this site should attract new players, and the remainder of the players that are still on these half dead profit driven servers.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if all of the rsc community is up to putting in the effort of having to train/start a new server(i think that’s the best/most fun part), but i know if things continue the way they are the RSC community will continue to dwindle to the point of no return. The flying solo part is definitely not working in anyone’s favor and i’m hoping the credibility of Mopar can knock some sense into the RSC community and centralize the players we have left.</p>
