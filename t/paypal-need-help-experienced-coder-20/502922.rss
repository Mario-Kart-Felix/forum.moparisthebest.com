    <description>Hello.

I have a server hosted on soho vps from ucvhost 3gb RAM.

Yet i&#39;m hosting about 40 players (we&#39;re brand new)

We keep dcing well once in an hour, most of the time its not a whole &quot;DC&quot; but like 18-55% of the server that lags out, rest just screen freeze, for a maximum of 14 seconds

I guess its some kind of cycle handling that lags it out? I removed my announcements already

I thought the &quot; [player-#] Fatal : couldn&#39;t find connection vertex: Dropping packet &quot; was the error, fixed most of it and it still happens, and yeah.

Then i thought it was the &quot; [ Player-#] invalid waypoint in walking queue &quot;


Or sometimes i get &quot; java.lang.Arrayoutofbounds&quot;

Also two unHandled packets but i don&#39;t think those would DC a server.

But when it dc&#39;s, most of the time, none of theses appears, it just dc&#39;s, and the vps is pure BLACK, like when i try to &#39;browse&#39; the vps screen, it just doesnt work until the &quot; lag&quot; is done.

It is not the providing because its a verified compagny, and i know my public void main is kinda off, well can anyone check it out? I&#39;ll give 20$ to whoever FIXES it, if you try and fail , too bad.

The source is EXILIUM PI/DSPK, I heard it&#39;s based to deathly pvpz but it&#39;s not really similar.


I also removed a zombie minigame that, i thought it caused lag


THANKS FOR FEEDBACK



** I&#39;ll post any files you request **

THIS IS WORTH IT!

This happened with the original source , so you can download the mopar source if you might want to test, i wont give you my game but screenshare\teamview only

**note. Didnt lag with my own computer when hosting, but its dual processing 16gb ram</description>
