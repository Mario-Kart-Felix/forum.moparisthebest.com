    <title>Corrupted Vista Partition</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/corrupted-vista-partition/109711</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if anybody can help me, but it&#39;s worth a try.

Vista fixes bad entries on my hard-drive during boot. This happens occasionally, a few days ago it fixed a lot of errors and then finished booting the system.

Basically, I can&#39;t view any file on drive (D) and you get the point.

Refrain from telling me: Format your drive, check if your hard-drive is plugged in.

I am not really skilled with hard-drives, MFTs and ect..</description>
