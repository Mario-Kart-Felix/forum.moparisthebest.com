What is a STAAR test? I never heard of it o.o
[/quote]
It replaces the TAKS and it&#39;s harder.
[/quote]What is TAKS?
[/quote]
Texas Association of Knowledge and Skills I think.

What I think:

TORTURE.ALL.KIDS.SILENTLY

STAAR stands for State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness

What I think:

STUDENTS.TORTURED.AFTER.AWESOME.RECESS (Or break for you guys. Break = Recess)

I&#39;ve had the last two weeks of school full of SACs for different classes, English SAC (which was an essay on a stupid book), a Media SAC, an Accounting SAC (i have another one tomorrow), ect. But i&#39;m not stressing out about anything, basically just winging it all.

<p>My mom made me start taking the practice tests(PSAT here) when I was in 9th grade and they definitely help you get a feel for what you’ll be experiencing on the real thing. Once you’ve taken it you’ll laugh at how nervous you were <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Unless of course you weren’t actually prepared… :o</p>
