    <title>Server Status Page Spammers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-status-page-spammers/541827</link>
    <description>I posted my server to the status page, and I was excited to see that its sorted by uptime.  Although I wondered how there could be so many servers at 100%.  I looked through the other advertisements to find that about half of them are the same server using different mopar accounts to post to the list.  I am suggesting letting staff members do a daily prune of the status page to get rid of duplicates.</description>

              <p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention, whenever somebody has an issue with the status page it’s usually dealt with fairly quickly. I’ve reviewed the page and removed 20 or so of the same server and banned the registrar for spamming and registering an absurd amount of accounts to obtain an advantage in advertising.</p>
