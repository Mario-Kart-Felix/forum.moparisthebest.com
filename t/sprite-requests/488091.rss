    <title>Sprite Requests</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sprite-requests/488091</link>
    <description>I have been trying to add new and &#39;unique&#39; features to my server.. And now I need some sprites.
The first, is.. Well. This is hard to explain. It&#39;d almost be an image of the Home Teleport button, but with a faded arrow in place of the H, and it&#39;d overlap the blue circles really.
I also need it in 2 different sizes. One is 18x18. and the other is 22x23.
Here&#39;s a copy of the Home teleport button:

[hr][hr]

Now, I need some for my UI I&#39;m making in a tab.
UI=User interface.
First, I need another image that&#39;s 22x23. It needs to resemble a Control Panel of some sort. Something that&#39;ll tell the user &quot;Hey,  there&#39;s buttons in here you need to look at&quot;

Next, I need 9 images for my Mod/Admin/Owner part of the tab. [Player/Donor part comes later]
It needs to consist of the following buttons:

[ol][li]Give Rank (So, something that shows a person giving another person something?)[/li]
[li]Give Item/Coin (This could be like a p hat, or a cash stack)[/li]
[li]Ban/Ipban player (So like a player in jail or somethng?)[/li]
[li]Mute/Ipmute player (A player with a covered mouth?)[/li]
[li]Staffzone tele (this button just tele&#39;s staff to the staffzone)[/li]
[li]Teleto button (Tele&#39;s player 1 to player 2)[/li]
[li]Teletome (Tele player 2 to player 1)[/li]
[li]Teleall (Obvious)[/li]
[li]Send Alert Message(Sends an alert across the server[/li][/ol]

Note: None of the images need to have text, as I can put the text on over it.

Now for the player side:

[ol][li]PK Teleport (sends the pk teleport list)[/li]
[li]Skill Teleport (Takes you to the Skill zone)[/li]
[li]Open Bank (Only works for player if not in wildy etc etc.)[/li]
[li]Buy Food (Work in progress.)[/li]
[li]Teleport to Donor Zone (Obvious)[/li]
[li]Change into Demon (Makes your character a random demon)[/li]
[li]Unused - Suggest[/li]
[li]Unused - Suggest[/li]
[li]Unused - Suggest[/li][/ol]


Here is the button that you will be using for each image:

Thank you all for taking the time to read, and thank you whoever makes the images.

I&#39;m also in need of a gfx artist for my server, so if you&#39;d like to. Please PM me.</description>

Oh I didn’t want it to fade. I wanted it faded. So it was pure white.<br>
And the tip would be at the top of the image, and the end being the middle of the image.<br>
The total size of the image is supposed to be 22x23<br>
[/quote]<br>
So you just want the opacity of it lowered?[/quote]<br>
That’d be the easiest way I assume.</p>
