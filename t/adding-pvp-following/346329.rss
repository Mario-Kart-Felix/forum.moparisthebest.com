    <title>Adding pvp following</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-pvp-following/346329</link>
    <description>Base: karmascape

Alright for the last 3 days, I have been trying to create a pvp following method.. and on all those occasions I have failed.
I have used killamess&#39;s pvp follow tutorial, but nothing :(
I have reverted the case 153 back to following, but it was still no help.
the reason for the case 153 revert was to check if the normal following would work, but yet it didn&#39;t.
Ugh this is frustrated, could anyone help, please?

Also: the reason why I am using karmascape, is that it was my first ever private server.
I have cleaned it down, and added some skills with a few msn friends, and packaged the server.</description>
