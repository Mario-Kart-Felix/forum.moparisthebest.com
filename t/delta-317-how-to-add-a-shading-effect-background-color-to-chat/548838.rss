    <title>[DELTA 317] - How to add a shading effect (background color to chat)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-317-how-to-add-a-shading-effect-background-color-to-chat/548838</link>
    <description>Hi there, I was wondering if anyone knew how to add a background shade command such as @sha@. It&#39;s basically an offset text command, which outlines the original color. I&#39;ve seen many PI based servers use this, as well as a few Delta&#39;s Such as Project Rainbow and BainScape (back in the day).


I have some colors added in my client that are pretty hard to see, and a black background behind them would be helpful... If any of you know about this please feel free to comment!


Thanks for looking.</description>

Hi there, I was wondering if anyone knew how to add a background shade command such as <span class="mention">@sha</span>@. It’s basically an offset text command, which outlines the original color. I’ve seen many PI based servers use this, as well as a few Delta’s Such as Project Rainbow and BainScape (back in the day).</p>

<p>I think the easiest way would be to take the text enclosed in the <span class="mention">@sha</span>@ tag, and then one pixel to the right, and one pixel down, draw that text on the screen in black, and then draw it colored.</p>
<p><code>
public void drawShadedString(final String message) {
    final int shadedX = x + 1;
    final int shadedY = y + 1;
    drawStringOnScreen(message, shadedX, shadedY, Color.BLACK);
    drawStringOnScreen(message, x, y, Color.YELLOW);
}
</code>[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for the help! How exactly would I implement that into say a server message? I mean would I have to convert that into some type of color code such as <span class="mention">@sha</span>@, or would it be more like a void such as sha()/ How would I go about doing that?</p>
