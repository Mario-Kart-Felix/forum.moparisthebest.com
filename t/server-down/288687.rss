    <title>Server Down?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-down/288687</link>
    <description>[size=25pt][b]It turns out it was my router this entire time...[/b][/size]

My RSCD Control Panels keeps on telling me my server is down.   And I can&#39;t think of a reason for it.  My server is indeed using my dedicated&#39;s database.  Also, I&#39;ve allowed the IP to access my database.  And it&#39;s still giving me the error.

Also, when I try to connect to the website using my client, I get a timed out error.
None of my settings are wrong, I&#39;ve tested those many times.

So, I&#39;ve come here for some help.
Any ideas on what could be causing this.  And if the server is in fact &quot;down&quot;, how would I go about turning it back on?

[b]I think the problem could be that it is unable to load the IP that my that my server is given.
71.74.235.73:43594
So, that would explain the connection timouts.
Does anyone know anyway that I could change or fix the error so that you can connect to my server through the IP of &quot;71.74.235.73:43594&quot;?[/b]
