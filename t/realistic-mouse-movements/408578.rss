    <title>Realistic mouse movements</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/realistic-mouse-movements/408578</link>
    <description>There were a few good threads on the subject by people like pplsuqbawlz, frank_, and semaphore, but they died, in my opinion, a tad bit early. /Hopefully/ this thread can revive the discussion.

Are current algorithms like Benland&#39;s adequate? Are they excessive? What algorithms would work best? Can an algorithm be driven by modern AI and *learn* from real humans?</description>

</aside>
<p>I know I’m hardly qualified to speak here, but I’ll give my opinion nonetheless. Simba probably makes up for such a tiny amount of bots, why would they even bother getting rid of it? I think they are better off spending the resources that have freed on improving the game itself, instead of getting rid of the few bots that remain.</p>

<p>Iirc, Jagex has recently claimed to be able to detect simple mouse recording programs in something like an hour. If their serverside detection systems are that well done, I doubt wind mouse is really going to do that much. I believe I read/heard somewhere that it is actually very predictable. I know super_ recently showed me an article that said modeling mouse movement timing after Fitts’s Law is actually very unrealistic, too.</p>

              <p>just a yes? no basis for that answer or facts/evidence to suggest or support that claim? They just “adjust” their detection system for a touchpad? I am aware that my “letter-vomit” is me rambling (i have the tendency to do that), but that’s a very crackpot answer to say that they can just adjust for the use of a script. If the script makes the same human errors, moves the cursor to a human-like selected area on the target(s) and clicks at human intervals, what basis would they have to say that there is a difference? Honestly, at least offer some kind of parameters that they would be looking into. Or is it that you don’t know, but want to just go with the flow on this one?  I didn’t want to have to flame, but you realy need to offer some kind of support to that answer of yours if you want it to sound at all convincing, especially when you want to just bypass my supporting facts about why I [imply] believe that they would have a hell of a time trying to figure out the difference, and label it as “letter-vomit”.</p>
<p>I am looking at this hypothesis objectively, but at least I am offering facts and support for my ideal claim. You on the other hand couldn’t convince me that I needed air to breathe. Try adding something to your answer as to “why” or “how” they can tell the difference between a user using a touch screen input and a script doing the same thing. Think about it this way:</p>
<p>Two acounts with the same stuff needed to complete the same task, same detail, location, etc… I do the task as a human with one account, and the other account is controlled by a script that does the exact same thing real-time as I do it (maybe about 4ms difference). Barring the idea of you watching both and knowing that it is too improbable that two accounts would do the exact same thing at the same time, would you be able to tell which one is human and which one isn’t? The idea is that the script is coded to operate with randomness in its accuracy, movement, clicking, and even its errors, so it appears to function like that of a human. Since this is undisputed so far, you say Jagex can still determine which one would be the script. Why?</p>
<p>[modify]</p>
<p>I want to add that the coding for the randomness is based on tests that i perform about how I personally interact with the client, so the script will operate as I do, such as how fast I click, move, how accurate I am, and what kinds of errors I make and how often. The script operating as if it were me in my eyes would appear to jagex to look like it were me playing. What do you say to that?</p>

              <p>Ok, let me try it with a hypothetical and see where this goes…(I don’t mean to hijack the mouse movement thread, but maybe this can flood jagex with too much data analysis if more people try this, thus resulting in the likelihood that scripts mimicking human mouse movements would be far less likely to be detected, or become obsolete very soon).</p>
<p>You use either a touchpad (iPad, or whatever else) or a touchsmart PC from HP, and you play runescape. The touch sensory is handled as a separate input device, and the data is then forwarded to the mouse move, position, drag, and click events within the system itself. These are legitimate uses of what Jagex would imply as “third-party software”, and they would lose too many paying customers if they actively scanned and banned those who use a touchscreen device for their mouse (apple would probably sue them for denying the use of their iPad, and claim they were anti-technologists or something), so they just let that slide, because let’s face it, anything beyond the basic 2 button mouse from a couple of decades ago runs on some sort of software or scripting for its advanced uses (Logitec mouse and keyboard anyone?), so Jagex will face alot of heat if they hunted down anyone who went with the times in regards to touch screens.</p>
<p>Now that the use of the touch is established as the hypothetical, and so far assume that Jagex may know when you are and aren’t using a computer that has one actively running, what happens when a script is run that does what you do? In this case, they will be looking for the drag and drops and mouse movements when they are most likely to occur rather than those mundane tasks of point and click, where a touchscreen would render the output to Jagex as mousecursorat(x,y); mouseclick=true. This is how it would appear to Jagex whether or not the script is run because the touchpad would do the same thing.</p>
<p>Now I ask you, if this hypothetical is true in the sense that it is indeed practical to play runescape using a touch screen as the mouse input device, Jagex understands you are using one via their “detection system”, and ignores the jumpicghng of the cursor, then after a bit of time (say a week or so) the use of a script would not get flagged because there is no notable change in hoe the cursor is acting clientside from the known use of the touch screen.</p>
<p>So basically what I am asking is if the only factor being taken into account is the mouse cursor jumping but they know that you use a touch screen, would they know or have evidence of when you are using a script to mouse click for you or not?</p>

This will ensure that Jagex sees that you are indeed using a touch screen, but they will not be able to actually determine whether you are running a macro that moves your cursor and clicks because it will look exactly the same as if a human were doing it.</p>
