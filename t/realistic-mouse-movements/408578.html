        <p>How did his original algorithm work? What about WindMouse? The physics-based one used in Kbot and Powerbot?</p>
<p>What we know:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Jagex can mark your account as “suspicious” (flagged in Aryan days) – /usually/ triggered by reports, according to the Player Moderator forum leak[/li]<br>
[li]Jagex can activate client-side mouse tracking send it to the server; logged data includes local mouse position and time… probably activated for “suspicious” accounts[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Given enough tracked mouse data, Jagex can accurately represent the progression of your mouse movement and model it mathematically. This model can likely be mapped to known “profiles”, if you will, of spline-based algorithms like Benland’s, using some statistical classification. Fool-proof accurate? Not quite, but potentially valuable information. Does Jagex do this? Maybe.</p>
<p>I think byte brought an article detailing something similar in the past… some sort of classifier (naive Bayesian maybe?) backed by biometric training samples, however I think it’s impractical to track <em>every</em> player to construct “normal” profiles for each. Plus, I doubt it would be too accurate either, considering automated tracked mouse input that went by unnoticed would taint the sanctity of the normal profile, and given enough of such pollution, the profile would fail to accurately distinguish the authentic player movement from typical movement.</p>
<p>Mouse movement algorithms that learn are a lightly-touched topic on the board. Enforcing each individual bot user to keep their own profile of mouse data, fed to a machine learning algorithm backing a classifier (back-propagation on a multi-layer perceptron ftw? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/coolae52.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:">) could potentially add a bit of “uniquity” (it’s in Webster’s Unabridged in 1913, it’s a real word! I swear :P) to the bot and give it a more organic, /human/ feel. Anybody try such an idea out? I think Robotzindisguise uses this method…</p>
<p>Many algorithms used in the scene today use a set tolerance and a bit of psuedo-randomness to help make the movement seem less “controlled”. One problem I’ve seen however is that humans aren’t /quite/ like this; in-fact, a model using a 2D probability distribution with appropriate decay rate, with highest “intensity” around the ideal destination point, seems more accurate here.</p>
<p>And on the topic of variable speed… I can go on and on. I think I’ll quit speaking for a little while. :o</p>

<p>In all seriousness, <em>decent</em> mouse movement algorithms will probably be more than enough to avoid being banned. Also, splines seem unfit for this job.</p>
<p>For those that don’t know, splines are piece-wise polynomial functions used for interpolating between data sets. The spline generates a “curve of best fit” (say, a quadratic or cubic Bezier curve); that is, it employs non-linear regression analysis techniques to derive an appropriate function which /nearly/ matches or, again, “fits” a /limited/ sample of data points (these are randomized and called control points in Benland’s MMouse algorithm found in Powerbot). An alternative to splines are continuous polynomial curves, used in cubic or quadratic regression. It’s basic high-school-Pre-Calc-level statistics.</p>
<p>One interpolates along the generated curve at a desired sampling frequency of their choice to extract “hops” and uses these for their mouse movement. The sampling frequency is derived from the results of an application of Fitt’s law of ergonomics, which successfully manages to approximate the human-like speed-accuracy trade-off logarithmically. The problem with these splines is that they are smooth, and even with tolerance-based psuedorandom noise (called variance here), it’s still fails to appear human-like. If you recorded your mouse movements and compared them to a the Bezier spline algorithm Taharok posted here a few years back, you’d be able to notice the difference. What makes you think <em>another</em> human can’t notice this either?</p>
<p>MMouse implemented in Java: <a href="https://github.com/powerbot/RSBot/blob/master/src/org/rsbot/script/internal/MouseHandler.java" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/powerbot/RSBot/blob/master/src/org/rsbot/script/internal/MouseHandler.java</a></p>
<p>Powerbot also features another algorithm that appears to succeed the previous one: <a href="https://github.com/powerbot/RSBot/blob/master/src/org/rsbot/script/task/MouseTask.java" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/powerbot/RSBot/blob/master/src/org/rsbot/script/task/MouseTask.java</a></p>
<p>This one is based off of a simple 2D physics simulation of your mouse as a rigid body being acted upon by forces towards your destination. Research suggests this was originally implemented in the now-defunct Kbot. I /don’t/ know enough about it’s performance to comment on it, but given the mechanics it likely was too smooth as well. It isn’t implemented as a spline for a change, however, so it may work out OK.</p>
<p>A similar algorithm is Benland’s WindMouse, mentioned by the bank earlier. Googling found me a URL to an implementation, once again in Java: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/downloads/simba/make_tools/plugin_builder/public-smart/src/smart/EventNazi.java" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/downloads/simba/make_tools/plugin_builder/public-smart/src/smart/EventNazi.java</a></p>
<p>It appears similarly physics-based. Not much to be said about it, either, but SCAR uses this algorithm now. Given reviews available on the SRL forums, it appears to be much “better” in terms of detectability in comparison to Benland’s older MMouse.</p>
<p>Most people say that detecting your mouse movements is not what generally will lead to detection of bots and banning of their users. It is claimed that poorly-designed scripts are more likely to be the reason. I suppose this logically makes more sense in accordance with Pareto’s principle. Still, once you have been flagged suspicious, it is likely your mouse is being tracked and logged server-side. I believe it was semaphore who stated that one cannot know when they have been reported and subsequently flagged as such and therefore, as it goes, <em>it’s better to be safe than sorry</em> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> However, for mouse tracking and whatever else to be activated, /shouldn’t/ the client receive some sort of signal from the server? Couldn’t this potentially be used to identify just exactly when the bot needs to start being careful? Or is tracking enabled by default? Answers here are welcome. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And, of course, an interesting article about machine-learning Fitt’s law. Can’t be /too/ much harm to read, right? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

        <p>Actually while I’ve got you here, I wouldn’t mind running a little idea I had past you.</p>
<p>You have 2 points, your starting location (lets call it A) and your destination (B).  Now let’s assume you have implemented a level of tolerance in your movement from A to B.  For this purpose, lets make that tolerance 5.  We then construct a triangle, with your tolerance being the base and your B point being the mid point of your base with a Y-value relative to the total distance.  Here’s a picture:<br>
<img src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/5431/trig1.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Now, your mouse movements must be contained within these bounds while moving along to point B.  However, with each “step” it takes, the base of the triangle is recreated at its current position.  This allows for a steeper triangle (and therefore lower level of tolerance) as it approaches the destination.  Here’s a picture incase you’re not following (with the current point being about halfway to its destination…lets say Point C):<br>
<img src="http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/5431/trig1.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>When it reaches the last “step” before Point B, its final location is then set to be somewhere within a rectangular area of “tolerance”.  This could be calculated at the very beginning and used as your B value instead.</p>
<p>Would a concept like this be effective?  I feel that as a human being my biggest area of error is when I begin moving my mouse, and my accuracy increases as I approach my destination.  With simple trigonometry, I believe I have demonstrated such a theory here.  I’d love to hear your thoughts before I make a POC.</p>

        <p>[quote=“the bank, post:6, topic:408578”]Actually while I’ve got you here, I wouldn’t mind running a little idea I had past you.</p>
<p>You have 2 points, your starting location (lets call it A) and your destination (B).  Now let’s assume you have implemented a level of tolerance in your movement from A to B.  For this purpose, lets make that tolerance 5.  We then construct a triangle, with your tolerance being the base and your B point being the mid point of your base with a Y-value relative to the total distance.  Here’s a picture:<br>
<img src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/5431/trig1.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Now, your mouse movements must be contained within these bounds while moving along to point B.  However, with each “step” it takes, the base of the triangle is recreated at its current position.  This allows for a steeper triangle (and therefore lower level of tolerance) as it approaches the destination.  Here’s a picture incase you’re not following (with the current point being about halfway to its destination…lets say Point C):<br>
<img src="http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/5431/trig1.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>When it reaches the last “step” before Point B, its final location is then set to be somewhere within a rectangular area of “tolerance”.  This could be calculated at the very beginning and used as your B value instead.</p>
<p>Would a concept like this be effective?  I feel that as a human being my biggest area of error is when I begin moving my mouse, and my accuracy increases as I approach my destination.  With simple trigonometry, I believe I have demonstrated such a theory here.  I’d love to hear your thoughts before I make a POC.[/quote]</p>
<p>It sounds like a fresh idea! However, from experience, I find myself randomly jittering and my mouse jerking out of the way when approaching something of great accuracy :|. Could this be common human nature? Or, more likely, is it just my Parkinson’s… <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>But on a serious note, it may be too simplistic. Do you have examples to show us the algorithm in action? It would be interesting to follow up on. What if you reversed the triangle? Would that not be a bit more natural feeling, or am I just hallucinating?</p>

Put your mouse somewhere near the corner of your screen.  Pick a point somewhere opposite to it, a button or something.

<p>Where the breadth of the triangle is greatest i.e. least tapered I tend to move more quickly, while approaching it I focus on accuracy more and reduce my speed… Unfortunately my jitter doesn’t conform to the triangle and seems to be fairly uniform through-out, although rationally I’d think with less accuracy I’d jitter more and there would be less tolerance / a smaller threshold of variance. In other words, your model rationally makes (to <em>me</em> that is) sense however a PoC would /indeed/ be interesting <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <p>I also think taking it all in steps with a short wait in between moving again may be a good idea.  I’d assume (as all movements have been previously), any detection algorithms they have are for measuring a consistent route to the destination.

<p>I also agree with your points on speed variance, however sometimes I find my first “movement” to be slower than the rest (usually because I’m trying to locate the mouse cursor on my screen).</p>

<p>The idea that interests me the most is a bot that mimics human mouse movement by being taught by one <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> However I doubt I, or anyone else for that matter, have the immediate will-power to actually implement a proof-of-concept here… :o</p>

        <p>Without looking too far into it, the idea of a teachable bot has been around for awhile.  Some guy named Syntax or something similar worked on one awhile ago, and sent me some of his work.  I don’t think its ever been released but its so old and out dated (not to mention incomplete) that I don’t think he’d mind if I posted it here.  I’ve made myself a note to do so next time I’m on my tower.</p>
<p>However, one could “teach” a computer how to move the mouse without actually implementing neural classes (ie. Brain, Eyes, Ears etc).  I’d go about this through some sort of calibration.  Launch an app and request the user to move the mouse from point A to point B several times.  Each time the “properties” of the path (ie. direction, distance etc) change.  With only a few entries I don’t think it would be that difficult to simply extend/compact and combine/split these patterns (with a certain degree of tolerance of course) to fit the needs of each individual mouse movement.</p>
<p>Although that sounds easier, it’d still be quite a bit of work, and would probably have a lot more overhead than any of today’s methods.  Is it really worth it?</p>

        <p>Worth it? I think so. Am I able to see the future? Sadly not. It can’t hurt to /try/ something cool though, no?</p>
<p>Synt[a]x (aka opTiX and pTiX) or as he was originally known here, System79, as far as I know, did <em>not</em> program something truly like this. I remember the code you’re talking about, where it abstracted the bot into something like a body as you stated. That code was frankly what most people call a POS <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Machine learning doesn’t require such stupid abstraction, and would be closer to what you brought up as “calibration”. The difference is that it would learn from a much higher-quality sample acquired from actual game-play. AI learning algorithms are actually just that though – <em>calibration</em> of parameters and weights in an artificial neural network. Your example is very simplistic though and naive in a sense… if you consider a bot as an intelligent agent in this sense, and the client being it’s environment, the mouse is a peripheral for interaction. Supervised learning algorithms would help develop and optimize the bot’s ability to predict a natural user movement. By training from individual users, bots could be fine-tuned to resemble their normal users “style” and keep movement unique for each bot.</p>

        <p>I’m just kind of running with the idea here but it would also be smart, imo, to not look at the game as singular.  For example, instead of looking how someone “plays the game”, look at how they interact with the inventory, or how they move to objects, change tabs etc.  In this way, a single bot could react entirely different given the situation of the user.</p>
<p>However, that opens up a whole new realm of problems.  How will scripts be able to anticipate usages without being made <span class="bbcode-i">specifically</span> for that user?  Maybe some people do things wrong…or inefficiently.  Not to mention the amount of time and annoyance the end-user my face while adapting the bot to their own specifications.</p>
<p>Personally, as cool as I think it would be, as a user or “scripter” I would almost be more comfortable with a more static, and predictable system.  But that goes both ways of course, as Jagex would also prefer that.</p>
<p>Why not hybridize the two?  A bot with a mostly static method of doing things, which could be mostly anticipated by someone developing for it (atleast enough so that they will know “basic” bot behavior) but allow certain aspects (speed, frequency of mouse jerks, frequency of over-shooting, accuracy, to name a few), to change overtime.  Perhaps through allowing the user to play the game legitimately for 10 mins, and collecting the data during that time period.  That way if the user ever wanted to “recalibrate”, they simply run that application again and spend another 10 minutes in game.</p>
<p>Not only would that be a <span class="bbcode-b">far</span> easier implementation (relatively speaking), it would still maintain the basic workings with only enough dynamic changes to throw off mouse “scanners” etc.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, <em>decent</em> mouse movement algorithms will probably be more than enough to avoid being banned. Also, splines seem unfit for this job.</p>
<p>For those that don’t know, splines are piece-wise polynomial functions used for interpolating between data sets. The spline generates a “curve of best fit” (say, a quadratic or cubic Bezier curve); that is, it employs non-linear regression analysis techniques to derive an appropriate function which /nearly/ matches or, again, “fits” a /limited/ sample of data points (these are randomized and called control points in Benland’s MMouse algorithm found in Powerbot). An alternative to splines are continuous polynomial curves, used in cubic or quadratic regression. It’s basic high-school-Pre-Calc-level statistics.</p>
<p>One interpolates along the generated curve at a desired sampling frequency of their choice to extract “hops” and uses these for their mouse movement. The sampling frequency is derived from the results of an application of Fitt’s law of ergonomics, which successfully manages to approximate the human-like speed-accuracy trade-off logarithmically. The problem with these splines is that they are smooth, and even with tolerance-based psuedorandom noise (called variance here), it’s still fails to appear human-like. If you recorded your mouse movements and compared them to a the Bezier spline algorithm Taharok posted here a few years back, you’d be able to notice the difference. What makes you think <em>another</em> human can’t notice this either?</p>
<p>MMouse implemented in Java: <a href="https://github.com/powerbot/RSBot/blob/master/src/org/rsbot/script/internal/MouseHandler.java" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/powerbot/RSBot/blob/master/src/org/rsbot/script/internal/MouseHandler.java</a></p>
<p>Powerbot also features another algorithm that appears to succeed the previous one: <a href="https://github.com/powerbot/RSBot/blob/master/src/org/rsbot/script/task/MouseTask.java" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/powerbot/RSBot/blob/master/src/org/rsbot/script/task/MouseTask.java</a></p>
<p>This one is based off of a simple 2D physics simulation of your mouse as a rigid body being acted upon by forces towards your destination. Research suggests this was originally implemented in the now-defunct Kbot. I /don’t/ know enough about it’s performance to comment on it, but given the mechanics it likely was too smooth as well. It isn’t implemented as a spline for a change, however, so it may work out OK.</p>
<p>A similar algorithm is Benland’s WindMouse, mentioned by the bank earlier. Googling found me a URL to an implementation, once again in Java: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/downloads/simba/make_tools/plugin_builder/public-smart/src/smart/EventNazi.java" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/downloads/simba/make_tools/plugin_builder/public-smart/src/smart/EventNazi.java</a></p>
<p>It appears similarly physics-based. Not much to be said about it, either, but SCAR uses this algorithm now. Given reviews available on the SRL forums, it appears to be much “better” in terms of detectability in comparison to Benland’s older MMouse.</p>
<p>Most people say that detecting your mouse movements is not what generally will lead to detection of bots and banning of their users. It is claimed that poorly-designed scripts are more likely to be the reason. I suppose this logically makes more sense in accordance with Pareto’s principle. Still, once you have been flagged suspicious, it is likely your mouse is being tracked and logged server-side. I believe it was semaphore who stated that one cannot know when they have been reported and subsequently flagged as such and therefore, as it goes, <em>it’s better to be safe than sorry</em> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> However, for mouse tracking and whatever else to be activated, /shouldn’t/ the client receive some sort of signal from the server? Couldn’t this potentially be used to identify just exactly when the bot needs to start being careful? Or is tracking enabled by default? Answers here are welcome. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And, of course, an interesting article about machine-learning Fitt’s law. Can’t be /too/ much harm to read, right? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

<p>Interesting /and/ fun to read indeed. Where is this from? Is this the Player Moderator leak?</p>
<p>As mentioned with the dartboard example, keeping an “area-of-uncertainty” as a static rectangle with a 2D uniform random distribution is <em>detectable</em>, Jagex confirmed it! I think they like the idea of some sort of non-uniform random multi-modal distribution, with a higher probability to hit near the bull-eyes. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<blockquote>There is accuracy, and precision. These programs do not replicate human precision. Consider the dartboard as an example: The goal is to simply "hit it."

<p>It appears they majorly catch players with /abnormal/ tendency to execute actions for long periods of times and send mouse clicks with impressive efficiency and accuracy, respectively.</p>
