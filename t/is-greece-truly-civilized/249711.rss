    <title>Is Greece truly civilized?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-greece-truly-civilized/249711</link>
    <description>Is Greece truly civilized? I doubt it. 

I don&#39;t know if you follow the news much, but a few days ago a 15 year old was shot by the Grecian police. What happened after that makes me think the people in Greece, and the youth in particular, is retarded. They thought that it was necessary to start riots and plunder shops, followed by throwing Molotov cocktails into the shops. And to top it off, they want new elections!

Of course, it&#39;s bad that the kid got shot. It shouldn&#39;t happen. But why riot about it? And why the hell does Greece need a new government? And last but not least: Why plunder shops?

There is a South Park episode that has a somewhat similar storyline, and it was the first thing that jumped to my mind. Something bad happens, and out of nowhere the urge to plunder arrives. I believe it was the episode about global warming, but I&#39;m not sure. Anyways, it shows that the plebs is retarded. Any civilized person wouldn&#39;t even think about plundering a shop.

And to finish off: think about it for a second, and then replace the 15 year old with a 30 year old homeless person doing drugs. You think the same would happen?</description>

              <p>Like someone else in this thread said, this world isn’t civilized. If tried hard enough, we revert to how we were 1000’s of years ago.</p>
<p>Also, American’s do riot. We are no better then anybody else.</p>
<p>We don’t blow shit up that we don’t understand. Old white republicans in the White House do that. Hope I don’t grow up like that.</p>

<p>No I did read, I was referring to when you were saying something along the lines of a civilized person would never…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh I see.</p>
<p>A civilized person is someone who thinks before he does something. In this case, the reaction (riot/plundering) has nothing to do with the action (death of the kid). A civilized person keeps thinks about what he is going to do. If his actions are truly justified, he does it.</p>
<p>An example: A serial-killer is arrested. He admits that he is guilty. Someone from the crowd attacks him, and punches him so hard the serial-killer gets permanent brain damage. The puncher probably gets arrested, but his actions are justified. He might be sentenced to a few months in jail, but it doesn’t matter. He isn’t a great example of a civilized person, but at least his reaction was justified.</p>
<p>Now another example: The same serial-killer gets arrested. Another person thinks that now the serial-killer is arrested, he can break into a shop. He is arrested, and his actions are not justified. He certainly is not civilized.</p>
<p>The last example seems quite far fetched, but it isn’t. The action: the killing, and the reaction: burglary, have nothing to do with each other. But the latter is a reaction to the first.</p>
<p>In the Greece situation it’s the same: The action, the death of the 15 year old, has nothing to do with plundering and rioting. A civilized person knows that, the reaction is not justified by the action.</p>
<p>Now to answer your question in short: The reactions of civilized people are justified by the action.[/quote]</p>
<p>Who did the killing? A government associated organization?<br>
Who are they stealing from? I don’t know if the system in Greece is any different from ours.</p>
<p>It’s kinda like:</p>
<p>A farmer shoots a dog.<br>
All the dogowners around go ballistic and steal all the farmers’ in the lands chickens.</p>
<p>Very simplified version, but it’s almost the same.</p>

<p>Oh I see.</p>
<p>A civilized person is someone who thinks before he does something. In this case, the reaction (riot/plundering) has nothing to do with the action (death of the kid). A civilized person keeps thinks about what he is going to do. If his actions are truly justified, he does it.</p>
<p>An example: A serial-killer is arrested. He admits that he is guilty. Someone from the crowd attacks him, and punches him so hard the serial-killer gets permanent brain damage. The puncher probably gets arrested, but his actions are justified. He might be sentenced to a few months in jail, but it doesn’t matter. He isn’t a great example of a civilized person, but at least his reaction was justified.</p>
<p>Now another example: The same serial-killer gets arrested. Another person thinks that now the serial-killer is arrested, he can break into a shop. He is arrested, and his actions are not justified. He certainly is not civilized.</p>
<p>The last example seems quite far fetched, but it isn’t. The action: the killing, and the reaction: burglary, have nothing to do with each other. But the latter is a reaction to the first.</p>
<p>In the Greece situation it’s the same: The action, the death of the 15 year old, has nothing to do with plundering and rioting. A civilized person knows that, the reaction is not justified by the action.</p>
<p>Now to answer your question in short: The reactions of civilized people are justified by the action.</p>

<p>Don’t look at the title, as it’s an exaggeration. Read what I typed, maybe read some news articles about it, and post your opinion.</p>
<p>Or discuss my opinion about it: people make an elephant of a mouse* and then exploit it so they can justify their need to riot and plunder.</p>
<p>*Or in this case, maybe a dog as it’s not a daily occurrence.</p>

              <p>Is Greece truly civilized? I doubt it.</p>
<p>I don’t know if you follow the news much, but a few days ago a 15 year old was shot by the Grecian police. What happened after that makes me think the people in Greece, and the youth in particular, is retarded. They thought that it was necessary to start riots and plunder shops, followed by throwing Molotov cocktails into the shops. And to top it off, they want new elections!</p>
<p>Of course, it’s bad that the kid got shot. It shouldn’t happen. But why riot about it? And why the hell does Greece need a new government? And last but not least: Why plunder shops?</p>
<p>There is a South Park episode that has a somewhat similar storyline, and it was the first thing that jumped to my mind. Something bad happens, and out of nowhere the urge to plunder arrives. I believe it was the episode about global warming, but I’m not sure. Anyways, it shows that the plebs is retarded. Any civilized person wouldn’t even think about plundering a shop.</p>
<p>And to finish off: think about it for a second, and then replace the 15 year old with a 30 year old homeless person doing drugs. You think the same would happen?</p>
