    <description>[size=24pt]Please reply to this and tell me what you think of this please![/size]

Ok so a few days ago i was playing WoW and i thught of a idea. &quot;What if i took Alliance and Horde (WoW factions) and added somthing similar to a rsps. So now I am trying to edit a private server to make it a bit more like WoW. Heres my ideas.

-At spawn theres 3 portals red team,blue team and then green protal which puts you on team that needs you most.

-Instead of making all new train areas and stuff for each faction (as I don&#39;t want to have to re-upload client because i got dial up and it takes forever) im making 4 areas that you can only attack people on the other faction. at every spot theres a control point. IF you capture it your team can tele there if not they have to tele out side of it (the attacking position) Those 4 areas are:

-Advanced shop area:Has better items then basic shops making it a key objective [b]COMPLETED[/b]

-Skills Area:Allows players to make advanced items if they can&#39;t capture the advanced shops. [b]COMPLETED[/b]

-Red Base Camp: A spawn outside reds base that if captured by blue could make them have no were to go.(If this happens and a staff is on he can type a command sending all players back to there base.

-Blue Base Camp: A spawn outside Blues base that if captured by red could make them have no were to go.(If this happens and a staff is on he can type a command sending all players back to there base.

Also when you make a account you get to choose a class which lets you have a special ability.(all special abilitys last for 25 seconds)

-Warrior-Rage-Boosts special attacks strengh by 10%

-Rouge-Invisiblity-Lets you go invisible.

-Hunter-Marksman-Increased bow damage.

-Palidan-Holy Light-gives you 50 hp.

-Priest-Pray-Gives you 50 prayer points

I will give detail on how this project is going as i code it.

Note: I think this is in the right section since it is server development but if it isnt please move it. Thanks

~Updates~
Both shop areas have been completed but not as planned since a ran into a problem making a npc make all players on one team being able to tele to one spot an the other team not being able to. Instead both sides are but on oppisite sides and the objectives in the middle.</description>

Yes you have a point why would people play a rsps if they like wow but your also frogeting about the people who like both. Im sure some people who like both would like to see a mix between both games.[quote=“Kihomura, post:7, topic:334058”]the name of the server will be something on one of these two pages.</p>

Actually a already had my server online before i thought of this project so it won’t be there. I would say the name of it but some one out there will post and complain and say that i advertised so i won’t.</p>

<p>-Advanced shop area:Has better items then basic shops making it a key objective <span class="bbcode-b">COMPLETED</span></p>
<p>-Skills Area:Allows players to make advanced items if they can’t capture the advanced shops. <span class="bbcode-b">COMPLETED</span></p>
<p>-Red Base Camp: A spawn outside reds base that if captured by blue could make them have no were to go.(If this happens and a staff is on he can type a command sending all players back to there base.</p>
<p>-Blue Base Camp: A spawn outside Blues base that if captured by red could make them have no were to go.(If this happens and a staff is on he can type a command sending all players back to there base.</p>
<p>Also when you make a account you get to choose a class which lets you have a special ability.(all special abilitys last for 25 seconds)</p>
<p>-Warrior-Rage-Boosts special attacks strengh by 10%</p>
<p>-Rouge-Invisiblity-Lets you go invisible.</p>
<p>-Hunter-Marksman-Increased bow damage.</p>
<p>-Palidan-Holy Light-gives you 50 hp.</p>
<p>-Priest-Pray-Gives you 50 prayer points</p>
<p>I will give detail on how this project is going as i code it.</p>
<p>Note: I think this is in the right section since it is server development but if it isnt please move it. Thanks</p>
<p>~Updates~<br>
Both shop areas have been completed but not as planned since a ran into a problem making a npc make all players on one team being able to tele to one spot an the other team not being able to. Instead both sides are but on oppisite sides and the objectives in the middle.</p>
