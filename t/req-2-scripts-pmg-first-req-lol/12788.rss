    <title>[REQ] 2 Scripts (pmg first req lol)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-2-scripts-pmg-first-req-lol/12788</link>
    <description>Hey, I need a GuildFisher script using SRL, and a flax-picker/banker that uses the Elf flax field. Here&#39;s some specs:

Both-

VERY good anti-randoms
PWNAGE anti-ban

Fisher-

Fishes for set amount of time then logs off...logs on sometimes after
Supports Lobs and Sharks (don&#39;t need the others)
Notices whirlpool
Auto-Banks
Gets the Harpoon/Cage back if it gets that random

Flax0r (&lt;3 pwnd lol...too bad i couldn&#39;t get his to work :()-

Picks for set amount of time then logs off...logs on sometimes after
Picks flax, then banks...simple

Yes, I know you probably hate me for making this thread now, but it&#39;s REALLY important that i make 13m ASAP (for some leveling to ownage stats) and at the moment I&#39;m not good in Pascal/Delphi (only know some Java)

If you could accept the job it would be MUCH appreciated...at the moment i won&#39;t be able to pay much, but if it works fine, then i should be able to pay you back, right? lol

Thanks in advance to whoever takes the job! (if i get lucky)
