<p>F2p wild is now active.  Commands ::dragons, ::castle, ::Varrock, ::dm.[/quote]</p>
<p>i only say that stEps doesn’t help someone with a single problem. i quit this server a while back, and then stEps banned my ip. i got into a vpn, and registered again, and told stEps id come back. he was fine with that, and let me join. i later tried to download the client, but there was an error since my ip was banned and i was in a vpn. i told this to stEps, and pretty much told me to “just figure it out” when he had the banning and unbanning options right in his hands. this wouldn’t have been a big deal if he would have just given me an external link to the client, but stEps can hardly lift a finger when it comes to a single player’s problem. i am no longer interested in this server, so yeah…</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/slaveofmen">@slaveofmen</a> Everything was addressed in a timely manner and all things will be dealt with if it is something that is the best for the server.  ex. if one person wants to be able to buy law runes from a store for 500gp then most likely it is not going to be implemented because it is not whats best for the server.</p>

              <p>hello everyone I would like to see this server do well as I know many others feel the same.</p>
<p>Problem: We have 2 servers that replicate what RSC used to be.</p>
<p>Solution: We have slaypk where we have higher experience rates, better drop rates, commands to get around the world, bosses, centralized edgeville for skillers.</p>
<pre><code> problem with this solution: Slaypk needs some organization and structure.
</code></pre>
<p>This is what I believe we need to rebuild our community and make this server that everyone wants to be successful.</p>
<p>1: Steady events leading to the need for a EVENT MOD or 2.<br>
2: implement some ideas that new comers may have to better the server.<br>
3: Having everyone that plays voice their opinions and be a part of the way the server develops.</p>
<p>Discuss what you think.</p>
<ul>
<li>many people say there is a boat load of people just waiting for a pk server, yet I do not see them here pking when the server is righteous.<br>
with this said some people think the server is going to be wiped, but the reality is that it has been online for over 7 months now without that nor is it going to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your serious about being a part of developing a server with pking then discuss what you like and dislike and we can move  forward together as a community to get to where we need to be.</p>

<p>For all the people that had doubts of this server going offline, it has now been proven that this is not the case.<br>
This server has been online now for well over 6 months and I wanted to prove that it will stay online.</p>
<p>With that said it has been a long time since we have did a double experience weekend, so it is now activated from March 21st-23rd.<br>
Also, when the player count is right there will be Capture the Flag and other random events to keep it entertaining.</p>
<p>This would be a great time for people who have not tried the server or the ones who have and are looking to gain some<br>
levels in skills with a bit of an incentive!  Inside the Wilderness you will gain the fastest experience for melee stats.</p>

<p>Super potions sets along with Prayer potions are back in Edgeville general store.(players liked the idea of being able to get these at any point in time, so they could go BOSS).</p>
<p>Rune 2hander is sold in edgeville 2 handed sword shop.</p>
<p>Rune Armour shop on the edgeville strip next to the stone head.(players liked ability to buy rune exactly when needed).</p>
<p>I like to listen to the players of the server with keeping in mind what will be best for the future of slaypk rsc.  Be glade to see everyone on pking and having fun vs no lifeing on a slow exp rate server that is trying to replicate what they did not make in the first place.<br>
We are all older now and majority are into pking and staking along with some skilling, but we don’t wanna have to do a skill for a dam year to get the ability to make something lol.</p>
<p>I would like to start running more capture the flag events, which are decently fun if we can get decent team numbers.  Along with some other events to put a few more rares that are not in the game currently into circulation.</p>
<p>Come try us out and become an active member not only in the game, but on the forums aswell.  We are built on community over here at slaypk rsc and that is what will keep us alive for a while to come.</p>

<p>I’m happy to announce that there is a new boss in the game.  Also, some monsters are smarter!<br>
Try your shot at this badass new boss that will drop 4 new rares into the game.  Also, will drop and add Dragon plate legs into the game. (there will be a topic for players to make drop guide).<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Introducing Zerdoga! (level 1360)</span><br>
