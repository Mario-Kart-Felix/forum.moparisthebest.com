    <description>Pking nerfed again.

http://news.runescape.com/c=uDW91Ehgv38/newsitem.ws?id=2022

You can&#39;t use protect item in Bh or Pvp worlds, you log in with auto-skull that doesn&#39;t disappear.

Now, you have nerds scouting the wild finding you while you&#39;re tryna get ep.

Getting ep is the only way to get good drops.

So, I think I&#39;m finally done with this game.</description>

<p>That’s bullshit. “The combat triangle is much more fair now”… A tank ranger (99 range, 99 defence) doesn’t have to spend much to buy effective gear. Now remember, in the combat triangle Melee overpowers Ranged; however, if a somebody using the Melee style of combat were to buy equal-in-value gear (equal to the ranger), they would lose. Why? Because a simple weapon like the Dragon Scimitar is no match for 99 ranged, and 99 defence - especially when the ranger’s armour is cheap but powerful.[/quote]<br>
And that’s why I like it so much. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Melee players and mage players are both fucked, haha.</p>

Awesome update, at least if you have a tank ranger with 99 range like yours truly. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

<p>I kinda like the update, stopped 26king and puts more risk into pking![/quote]<br>
Check out this post, there’s a few images including a picture of all pertinent stats: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,366442.msg2780083.html#msg2780083" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,366442.msg2780083.html#msg2780083</a></p>
<p>The pic is a bit outdated though; I’m now 94 magic, 84 defence.</p>

              <blockquote>THIS ISNT LIVE YET, THIS IS WHAT WE ARE PLANNING TO DO. 
<p>We are proposing to make 3 of the existing bounty worlds<br>
(18,32 and 65), worlds where when you die you ALWAYS keep 1 item.</p>
<p>You still won’t be able to use ‘protect item’ on those worlds, (so we still avoid the problem with the number of items being kept being variable which was breaking the risk calculations, which is what we were originally aiming to do). Instead you just ALWAYS keep one item on death on those worlds. This should mean that items like godswords, dragon claws etc… can then still be safely used on those worlds.</p>
<p>I hope this helps people who prefer that style of gameplay. E.g. you will be able to CHOOSE your style of PvP gameplay and hopefully everyone will be happy. E.g. if you don’t like 1 iteming and want to fight with dragon scimitars etc, at mage bank etc… you will be able to use one type of world, and if you want to use your high power weapons that you’ve saved up for you can use a different world and do that too.</p>
<p>The options will be:</p>
<p>PvP worlds (lose all items on death, no protect item)<br>
Bounty worlds (lose all items on death, no protect item)<br>
Bounty+1 worlds (keep 1 item on death, no protect item).</p>
<p>This is just a proposal so far. What do you think?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>
<p>It is now live.</p>
<blockquote>With the recent disabling of Protect Item prayers on PvP Worlds, a lot of players feel that we had rendered their high-value weapons (godswords and dragon claws, in particular) worthless. While no changes had been made to the weapons themselves, the amount of wealth you had to risk in order to use those weapons was considered prohibitively high. 
<p>We obviously don’t want you to feel like your investment is wasted; we appreciate how much work some of you have put into getting those items! But, we also don’t want to undo changes that we feel are good for PKing as whole.</p>
<p>So, we’ve come up with a way of hopefully achieving both goals. Today we are introducing a new type of Bounty World. These ‘+1 item’ worlds still won’t allow you to use the Protect Item prayer, but, instead, everyone will always keep their most valuable item protected.</p>
<p>On these worlds, to gain drop potential you (as usual) have to be risking 75k (or 25k on a free world). Because you always keep your most valuable item on these worlds, this means you have to risk 75k of items in ADDITION to your always-protected item.</p>
<p>This has the following advantages:<br>
a) It still achieves our original intentions of making it harder to gain drop potential and participate in rewarding combat without actually really risking something;<br>
b) It stops high-value weapons being made worthless and still maintains that type of gameplay for people who enjoy it;<br>
c) Conversely, people who feel the new, more powerful weapons unbalanced PKing, without any risk to the wielder, have a different type of world that they can enjoy too.</p>
<p>NOTE - Our ISP issues have meant that world 32, the planned +1 item Bounty World for free players, is not currently available. We sincerely apologise and hope to get this world back online as soon as possible.</p>

That goes both ways. If we don’t get to make our items because we die, then pkers don’t get items to buy.</p>

<p>That’s bullshit. “The combat triangle is much more fair now”… A tank ranger (99 range, 99 defence) doesn’t have to spend much to buy effective gear. Now remember, in the combat triangle Melee overpowers Ranged; however, if a somebody using the Melee style of combat were to buy equal-in-value gear (equal to the ranger), they would lose. Why? Because a simple weapon like the Dragon Scimitar is no match for 99 ranged, and 99 defence - especially when the ranger’s armour is cheap but powerful.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>Hey, 
<p>As you are probably aware, we have recently made some rather drastic changes to what players risk on PvP Worlds. In case you are one of the people who don’t know, here is what we changed:<br>
On PvP Worlds, you will always be skulled and cannot use the Protect Item prayer.</p>
<p>We launched this update without much explanation as to why we were making the changes. The reason for this is because we knew how big they were and we didn’t want to dilute it behind a wall of reasons and excuses, but we just wanted to make sure to keep it as clear and to-the-point as possible, and the players who would be affected by this would know the immediate consequences without us explaining it to them. But now that a bit of time has passed, we feel that it is appropriate to share the reasons behind it.</p>
<p>We initially sat down to discuss the 26k issue and what we could do about that. Safe to say, this meeting ended up covering a much broader area, but I will try to take it step by step. When we first created PvP Worlds, we had a lot of different ideas on how we could distribute loot for kills and what had to be lost by the victim in order for the PKer to claim a reward. During most of development, the value that had to be lost was sitting at 75k, but as the release date approached, we changed it to 25k to keep it in line with the free-to-play game, even though the rewards are a lot greater in members’ world. So, the first and easiest step to keep the kill-swapping down was to simply put the value back up to 75k and also make sure that this value in no way affected the so called death pot (I’ll talk more about that soon).</p>
<p>However, we, as well as you, know that this won’t put it to a complete stop, and we have more changes planned for the future. These require a bit more work, so it will take a little while, but it shouldn’t have an as big of an impact on the PvP scene as a whole as the most recent changes have had. We will let you know about the details in due time.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why it was so easy to do the 26k trick (besides the obviously low cost) was that it was also very easy to generate earning potential relatively risk free, due to the skulling mechanics and the Protect Item prayer. This, however, is an issue that stretches further than just 26k-ing. Lots of people used the Protect Item prayer just so that they could continuously rush into combat with a single weapon and never risk losing anything (so called one-itemers). This has been the case for as long as PKing has been around, but now they can gain greater rewards for no risk and the weapons players have access to have increased a bit in power from rune 2-handed swords in Classic and dragon daggers in the first few years of RuneScape 2, to godswords and dragon claws. This means that it has gotten increasingly easier to have a very high combat potential with minimal risk.</p>
<p>This is where the Protect Item prayer comes in. Our main reason to disable this on PvP Worlds was to make it slightly harder to gain earning potential risk free, particularly via one-iteming, and to make sure the risk versus reward balance was stabilized. We of course knew that this would have consequences beyond these two groups of people, but we didn’t necessarily consider them all to be negative (although we’re not denying that some certainly are).</p>
<p>The way weapons have increased in power throughout the years has resulted in a big amount of a player’s combat efficiency to be tied to a single item, which is what made one-iteming so easy, and the cheap Protect Item prayer has become the massively powerful tool that allows this. We do appreciate that there are a lot of people who use these valuable items while still risking wealth in form of armour and jewellery. However, two people in full rune armour can both be risking the same amount of wealth while the items they keep protected vary massively in power (e.g. a dragon scimitar compared to an Armadyl godsword). The prayer simply allows players to bypass a large portion of what is supposed to be a risk vs reward system.</p>
<p>We don’t necessarily feel it is a bad thing that people get a bit (or a lot) more careful about when they choose to use these expensive and powerful items. Now, you might argue that the players in question have deserved this bonus when they earned the money to buy it, but that doesn’t change the fact that they can still bypass the risk. Secondly, godswords and dragon claws are extremely powerful due to their high hits, and, as far as PvP goes, this has put a big dent in the combat triangle (which wasn’t all that dent free to begin with). More specifically, it has caused a major issue for mages, who, due to their lack of armour, have become even easier targets from a class they are supposed to be strong against. We feel that disabling the Protect Item prayer has evened out the combat triangle a bit, which we consider a good thing. People can still use these powerful weapons, but now they have to do so with the risks that follow.</p>
<p>A bigger issue than people not daring to risk their dragon claws and godswords is the abyssal whip. This is a fairly powerful weapon as far as damage over time goes, but lacks the massive hits of more expensive items. However, it is still expensive enough to make some PKers afraid of risking them under the new system. To these people, I would like to repeat something that is briefly mentioned on the Knowledge Base page, which we simply refer to as the ‘death pot.’ When you die, part of the wealth you have lost beyond the initial 75k (or 25k on a free-to-play world) is added to a separate pot which is used along with your earning potential to generate drops. So if you do risk a whip and lose it, a big part of its value will be saved away for your future drops. In the long run, assuming you get some kills, you will therefore be making this value back. However, it is worth pointing out that the amount of lost wealth that can be transferred to the death pot at any one time is capped, so losing a massive stack of junk items or a godsword would not generate as big of a percentage back into the death pot as less valuable items would, and noted items don’t add anything at all. I don’t want to give out any exact numbers, but I can at least confirm that a whip will be quite heavily compensated for (although obviously not by its full value!).</p>
<p>Another topic that has been floating around along with these changes are the so called PJers (pile jumpers, player jumpers, etc.). We’re hoping that one side effect of the disabling of Protect Item will reduce the amount of players who choose to resort to this method, as waiting around in a dangerous area can now leave them as quite an appealing target for other players. We certainly don’t think it will stop it, as even before the update they were quite often risking the valuable weapons other players are now concerned about. However, we do have plans to make 1-versus-1 combat a bit more stable and harder to interrupt, and we hope to have these changes with you in the near future (I will be working on them this week).</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to point out that we will be keeping a very close eye on how the recent update has affected the PvP scene, and we are definitely open to tweaking it if necessary.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Mod Benny</p>

<p>Yeah, something you skillers don’t realize is that if it wasn’t for pkers, your food, pots, runes, etc wouldn’t get bought, although, they are general items and do get used for other things… But you see my point.</p>

<p>You can’t use protect item in Bh or Pvp worlds, you log in with auto-skull that doesn’t disappear.</p>
<p>Now, you have nerds scouting the wild finding you while you’re tryna get ep.</p>
<p>Getting ep is the only way to get good drops.</p>
<p>So, I think I’m finally done with this game.[/quote]It worked before? I always lost all of my items… and yet was never skulled…</p>
