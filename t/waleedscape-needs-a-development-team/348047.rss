    <description>Hello moparscapians!   :rolleyes:

I  kept my server, WaleedScape up for at least 1 month, then i figured that my coding sucked ass. my minigames were at 7% most of my items were nulled, and my NPC&#39;s, models, and animations were at 10% or less. and  the reason why i kept the server running so long is because 1 kid told me on the server 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Holy shit man! this is some c00l st00f u hve here!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
he tried using the nulls as armour, and he told me &quot;i cant use these null things..&quot;
i just lol&#39;d  so hard at him, then i just took the server down. his user was Reijou.

Anyways! if u can do the following, please tell me. im desperate for coders as this is my first year on mopar. thanks guys!

[size=24pt]Positions[/size]
Coder1
coder2
coder3
GFX Master 
bugs+glitches Master (not sure what to call that...)


Client positions:
Animation master
Modelor
Banner designer
(idk the name for this, but some1 who can code in items to client?)
I may sound like a real noob, but i know i am. please dont flame and teach me my mistakes and errors, etc

well, thats all the positions, if u would like to have one of these positions, please say it in this format:

I would like to take position: (choose from 1 above)
I have been coding for: (e.g 2 years)
My expertise at coding (your chosen pos)  is (what your best at in the pos you chose)
I am (your age here)
my MSN is: (your MSN)

Thank you guys, i hope someone will help me out. if u want any pics of the server, ill post them. but sadly, i renewed my source to Deathzscape V2 by bloodmaniet and i need LOTS of stuff to be coded (not demanding here) ,  i will help too, but i really wont be much of a big help. its best i stay out of ur way, but any requirements to code, or stuff like that, ill be glad to do it

Thanks a bunch!
EDIT: keeping the source to EvolutionX V5 STILL needs updates</description>

<p>You have obviously not coded for 2 years. Maybe one. I’ve never heard of the categories “bugs+glitches coder”, "item coder, “animation coder”, “GFX coder”, and “banner designer”. You don’t use “Codes” to make a picture/banner. Usually, on Mopar, we call it “GFX Master”.<br>
“Banner designer” + “GFX Coder” are almost the same thing. Except one is banners, and the other could be crowns, sigs, or many other things… What’s up with the item coder and stuff around that category (E.g. Animation Coder). That’s ALMOST completely client-sided.</p>
