<p>I suggest using your own link and creating a table with 1 column and more than 1 row.</p>
<p>I mentioned efficiency because that’s how you should judge redundancies. Remaking the table every time does not do anything to efficiency.<br>
[/quote]How does it not affect efficiency?  The browser has to parse and render a new table each time, rather than rendering an additional row; more data must be transferred; etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, just stop trying to defend this, it was completely retarded; just move on and learn from your mistake.</p>


<p>Yes, those .0025 seconds rendering the table make such a difference!</p>
<p>Do you still believe there are no rows in his table…?<br>
[/quote]You claimed that it doesn’t do anything to the efficiency, which is not true.</p>
<p>Also, TD is a cell in a row, and you’re just lucky that browsers cater to idiots like yourself and realize that there needs to be a row.</p>
<p>In addition, there are numerous issues with it other than the tables…  For example, you never close the <b> tag, you don’t have head/body tags, etc.</b></p>


<p>So are there any rows in his table or not? Sidestepping the question only highlights your inadequacy and shows that your original post in this thread is entirely wrong.</p>
<p>As to the efficiency remark: Does the way he has it now do anything to make it less efficient? No. Parsing a table or a row makes no noticeable difference to anyone with a computer. This isn’t 1996 and we aren’t transmitting data at 28kbps.</p>
<p>If you still believe the first post you made on here was correct, then try and make me a table without any rows. When you fail, you can stfu for once.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In the HTML as it stands, no, but most browsers will infer that there needs to be rows and add it so it will render properly.  Also, each table is not a row, it’s a table.</p>
<p>If it makes no difference then why doesn’t any major website do it like that?  In addition, perceived efficiency and actual efficiency are completely different things, and you said efficiency, which is actual efficiency; therefore any inefficiency is valid and perceived efficiency is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The table in the OP has no rows.  If you visit the page with curl there will be no tr tag; this is because your browser is automatically generating it so that it renders correctly, and this behavior is different across browsers.</p>


<p>… There is no visual user agent that will render a table without rows. Even a TTY device will show rows if they’re not defined. It’s impossible to create a table with no rows. You’re literally arguing the point that just because the rows are not defined, they do not exist.</p>
<p>I don’t recall saying each table was a row, so your statement saying a table is a table is useless.</p>
<p>As to efficiency: prove it. I’ve already tried and it’s impossible to measure the difference between remaking the table and simply having the data inputted into each row/column. As to why no major website does it like that, I have no clue wtf you are on about. What major websites do you visit that have tables all over the place?<br>
[/quote]You’re changing the criteria to fit your argument…  There are no rows, and like I’ve been saying for the last couple of posts, the browser is just inferring they’re there so it will render properly.</p>
<p>I was anticipating one of you’re completely retarded points…</p>
<p>It’s basic counting…  You’re sending more data than you have to, therefore it’s less efficient.  As for the table generation, it’s quite obvious that there is more work involved in generating a completely new table than it is rows.  Also, when making exactly 100k tables it took 5 seconds ± 1 second.  When making 1 table with exactly 100k rows it took 2 seconds ± 1 second.  I was using Chromium to test.</p>
<p>Here are the commands to generate the files:<br>
perl -e ‘print "</p>
<table><td>idiot</td></table>"x100000’ &gt;&gt; test.html<br>
perl -e ‘print “<table>”; print "<tr><td>idiot</td></tr>"x100000; print “</table>”’ &gt;&gt; test1.html
<p>Also, I never said major sites have tables all over the place.  The sites that actually use tables don’t use them like that, because it’s fucking retarded.</p>


<p>And like I said before, it’s impossible to create a table with no rows. Otherwise it’s a single column of boxes a single row of boxes or simply one box. The </p>
</tr>
<tr> element is simply a container. Omitting it does absolutely nothing to the structure of the table.
<p>As to your test, thank you for proving my point. Notice how I said <span class="bbcode-b">in this instance</span> it does nothing to efficiency. You had to create 100k tables just to see a difference. Talk about reading comprehension fail. See, in this instance, only one table is created for each input. Therefore, there is absolutely no loss of efficiency. Failure to see something so trivial is your fault.</p>
<p>As for how sites use tables, you have no clue how they do it. You are simply stating bullshit rhetoric under the assumption that it is correct. Most major sites use ASP .NET anyways and would use table control over HTML.</p>
<p>EDIT: LOL, I just ran your same test. 100k tables = 3.661 seconds - 100k rows = 3.024 seconds<br>
Second time: 100k tables = 3.850 seconds - 100k rows = 3.573 seconds</p>
<p>You want to know why it’s like that? Because HTML reads rows incrementally. A table with 10 rows will be processed in the same amount of time as 10 tables with 1 row.</p>
<p>[/quote]You’re wrong.  Leaving out the tr tag leaves out the row.  If you look at the HTML, and not what has been created by the browser to make it render properly you’ll  see that you’re wrong.</p>
<p>I used 100k because I was doing a ‘wall-clock’ measurement, because I didn’t feel like going through the effort of measuring precisely.  I could have done 5 tables vs 5 rows, it will just be scaled down, which you obviously can’t comprehend.  Also, you just admitted it was less efficient, but then say it isn’t, holy shit you’re retarded…</p>
<p>Right, because I’ve never looked into how browsers render pages…  I’ve also never programmed anything similar and had to account for idiots, like yourself, who don’t know how to use tables properly…  In addition, <a href="http://ASP.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">ASP.NET</a> has nothing to do with how the browser renders the HTML tags for tables.</p>
<p>How exactly did you measure those numbers, what browser, and what hardware?</p>
<p>If you wrote the tables properly I’d be inclined to say the performance would be extremely similar, but you’re not, and there is a ‘lot’ of overhead from the inference and code that need to be generated.</p>
<p>In addition, rendering times are only a portion of what goes into efficiency.  Look at the file sizes of both tests; the incorrect usage of tables is larger, and therefore more inefficient.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thought I’d quote this and then say hi.</p>

<p>In the HTML as it stands, no, but most browsers will infer that there needs to be rows and add it so it will render properly.  Also, each table is not a row, it’s a table.</p>
<p>If it makes no difference then why doesn’t any major website do it like that?  In addition, perceived efficiency and actual efficiency are completely different things, and you said efficiency, which is actual efficiency; therefore any inefficiency is valid and perceived efficiency is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The table in the OP has no rows.  If you visit the page with curl there will be no tr tag; this is because your browser is automatically generating it so that it renders correctly, and this behavior is different across browsers.</p>


<p>… There is no visual user agent that will render a table without rows. Even a TTY device will show rows if they’re not defined. It’s impossible to create a table with no rows. You’re literally arguing the point that just because the rows are not defined, they do not exist.</p>
<p>I don’t recall saying each table was a row, so your statement saying a table is a table is useless.</p>
<p>As to efficiency: prove it. I’ve already tried and it’s impossible to measure the difference between remaking the table and simply having the data inputted into each row/column. As to why no major website does it like that, I have no clue wtf you are on about. What major websites do you visit that have tables all over the place?<br>
[/quote]You’re changing the criteria to fit your argument…  There are no rows, and like I’ve been saying for the last couple of posts, the browser is just inferring they’re there so it will render properly.</p>
<p>I was anticipating one of you’re completely retarded points…</p>
<p>It’s basic counting…  You’re sending more data than you have to, therefore it’s less efficient.  As for the table generation, it’s quite obvious that there is more work involved in generating a completely new table than it is rows.  Also, when making exactly 100k tables it took 5 seconds ± 1 second.  When making 1 table with exactly 100k rows it took 2 seconds ± 1 second.  I was using Chromium to test.</p>
<p>Here are the commands to generate the files:<br>
perl -e ‘print "</p>
<table><td>idiot</td></table>"x100000’ &gt;&gt; test.html<br>
perl -e ‘print “<table>”; print "<tr><td>idiot</td></tr>"x100000; print “</table>”’ &gt;&gt; test1.html
<p>Also, I never said major sites have tables all over the place.  The sites that actually use tables don’t use them like that, because it’s fucking retarded.</p>


<p>And like I said before, it’s impossible to create a table with no rows. Otherwise it’s a single column of boxes a single row of boxes or simply one box. The </p>
</tr>
<tr> element is simply a container. Omitting it does absolutely nothing to the structure of the table.
<p>As to your test, thank you for proving my point. Notice how I said <span class="bbcode-b">in this instance</span> it does nothing to efficiency. You had to create 100k tables just to see a difference. Talk about reading comprehension fail. See, in this instance, only one table is created for each input. Therefore, there is absolutely no loss of efficiency. Failure to see something so trivial is your fault.</p>
<p>As for how sites use tables, you have no clue how they do it. You are simply stating bullshit rhetoric under the assumption that it is correct. Most major sites use ASP .NET anyways and would use table control over HTML.</p>
<p>EDIT: LOL, I just ran your same test. 100k tables = 3.661 seconds - 100k rows = 3.024 seconds<br>
Second time: 100k tables = 3.850 seconds - 100k rows = 3.573 seconds</p>
<p>You want to know why it’s like that? Because HTML reads rows incrementally. A table with 10 rows will be processed in the same amount of time as 10 tables with 1 row.[/quote]You’re wrong.  Leaving out the tr tag leaves out the row.  If you look at the HTML, and not what has been created by the browser to make it render properly you’ll  see that you’re wrong.</p>
<p>I used 100k because I was doing a ‘wall-clock’ measurement, because I didn’t feel like going through the effort of measuring precisely.  I could have done 5 tables vs 5 rows, it will just be scaled down, which you obviously can’t comprehend.  Also, you just admitted it was less efficient, but then say it isn’t, holy shit you’re retarded…</p>
<p>Right, because I’ve never looked into how browsers render pages…  I’ve also never programmed anything similar and had to account for idiots, like yourself, who don’t know how to use tables properly…  In addition, <a href="http://ASP.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">ASP.NET</a> has nothing to do with how the browser renders the HTML tags for tables.</p>
<p>How exactly did you measure those numbers, what browser, and what hardware?</p>
<p>If you wrote the tables properly I’d be inclined to say the performance would be extremely similar, but you’re not, and there is a ‘lot’ of overhead from the inference and code that need to be generated.</p>
<p>In addition, rendering times are only a portion of what goes into efficiency.  Look at the file sizes of both tests; the incorrect usage of tables is larger, and therefore more inefficient.</p>

<p>In the HTML as it stands, no, but most browsers will infer that there needs to be rows and add it so it will render properly.  Also, each table is not a row, it’s a table.</p>
<p>If it makes no difference then why doesn’t any major website do it like that?  In addition, perceived efficiency and actual efficiency are completely different things, and you said efficiency, which is actual efficiency; therefore any inefficiency is valid and perceived efficiency is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The table in the OP has no rows.  If you visit the page with curl there will be no tr tag; this is because your browser is automatically generating it so that it renders correctly, and this behavior is different across browsers.[/quote]</p>
<p>… There is no visual user agent that will render a table without rows. Even a TTY device will show rows if they’re not defined. It’s impossible to create a table with no rows. You’re literally arguing the point that just because the rows are not defined, they do not exist.</p>
<p>I don’t recall saying each table was a row, so your statement saying a table is a table is useless.</p>
<p>As to efficiency: prove it. I’ve already tried and it’s impossible to measure the difference between remaking the table and simply having the data inputted into each row/column. As to why no major website does it like that, I have no clue wtf you are on about. What major websites do you visit that have tables all over the place?</p>
