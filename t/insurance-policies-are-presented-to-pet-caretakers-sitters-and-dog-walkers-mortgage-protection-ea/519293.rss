<p>Interested in paying your mortgage within the event lost your job? You’ll need Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance - but remember , rolling around basic form, this insurance plans are really only which are designed to cover redundancy. In case resign or are fired for gross misconduct your unlikely that must be insured. The retail price? Online you would pay around L2.45 per L100 of monthly payment for every policy which starts spending on 15 days after you’ve been made redundant which will then pay off for as many as 365 days. You are certain to occur to be offered similar insurance from the bank or lender but avoid, their premiums could be a couple of times higher for identical cover.</p>
