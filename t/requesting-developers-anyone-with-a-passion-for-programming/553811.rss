[LEFT][COLOR=navy]We Fallian, are in the process of making a game that will hopefully rival Runescape itself in good time. No more of the RSPS competition between each other with little to no differences in game play. Here&#39;s a few things we are planning on doing to give you an idea. We are trying to make something truly unique by starting with the actual game Runescape.
We are planning on making everything work in the game just as it does in RS; Pre-Eoc because that was their downfall primarily.
After we get done and have a 100% working game we plan on using that source as a base, for a new game we can mold.
We plan on making our own game out of a working Runescape Base. We have tons of idea&#39;s and tons of dedication put into this project. We are just short on Developers.


However, we have the same communication/collaboration tools as the biggest game developing teams in the business (for example, Blizzard Entertainment). 
We use: Atlassian JIRA (Issue Tracker), Atlassian Confluence (Enterprise Wiki/Knowledge Base/Documentation), Atlassian Bitbucket Server (In-house Git), IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, JavaRebel (Improved JVM HotSwapping), Atlassian HipChat which integrates directly with the World, Lobby, and Authentication Servers, AMQP for Server-to-Server-(to-client) communication, 
MariaDB as our database engine, and much more. Most of these tools are smartphone compatible. All accounting is handled through a central authentication server that has a proprietary OAuth2 server implementation, Restful API, and multi-factored authentication. Our team name is Registered and Trademarked by the parent company, (VIONOX Inc.).

As for pay, Right now no one on the team is being paid due to lack of funds. [B]Once we are fully online and running we will be paying the developers [/B]for their previous work done, and then from there on. Right now we are in our Pre-Alpha Stage, Scheduled for an Open Alpha Release Soon.[/COLOR]

<p>I was talking about our programming tools, not the map editing tool we are currently looking for, we obviously need one to add different areas to the game and edit current ones. If we are unable to find one we will have to make one ourselves or rewrite a lower revision editor.</p>

<p>This is a professional post, its worded correctly, formatted correctly, &amp; everything is grammatically correct. Putting that meant anyone can join the team, all you need is commitment. If that changes your perception of whether or not its professional, then i am sorry i confused you.

I understand your concern, however i would rather tell people that from the start rather then lie to them or wait for them to ask that question themselves. I do agree it isn't ideal for most programmers to want to join a team when they see we cannot pay yet. But even with that in mind, we have still gotten people who are willing to invest their time into our project. By the way, Lack of funds in terms of being able to pay for all our developers, we have funds just they are for the things that are vital to keeping the project at a constantly progressing rate. Thank you for the feedback :)

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iH1xbyO.jpg?2" alt width="500" height="313">[/CENTER]</p>
<p>[LEFT][COLOR=navy]We Fallian, are in the process of making a game that will hopefully rival Runescape itself in good time. No more of the RSPS competition between each other with little to no differences in game play. Here’s a few things we are planning on doing to give you an idea. We are trying to make something truly unique by starting with the actual game Runescape.<br>
We are planning on making everything work in the game just as it does in RS; Pre-Eoc because that was their downfall primarily.<br>
After we get done and have a 100% working game we plan on using that source as a base, for a new game we can mold.<br>
We plan on making our own game out of a working Runescape Base. We have tons of idea’s and tons of dedication put into this project. We are just short on Developers.</p>
<p>However, we have the same communication/collaboration tools as the biggest game developing teams in the business (for example, Blizzard Entertainment).<br>
We use: Atlassian JIRA (Issue Tracker), Atlassian Confluence (Enterprise Wiki/Knowledge Base/Documentation), Atlassian Bitbucket Server (In-house Git), IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, JavaRebel (Improved JVM HotSwapping), Atlassian HipChat which integrates directly with the World, Lobby, and Authentication Servers, AMQP for Server-to-Server-(to-client) communication,<br>
MariaDB as our database engine, and much more. Most of these tools are smartphone compatible. All accounting is handled through a central authentication server that has a proprietary OAuth2 server implementation, Restful API, and multi-factored authentication. Our team name is Registered and Trademarked by the parent company, (VIONOX Inc.).</p>
<p>As for pay, Right now no one on the team is being paid due to lack of funds. [B]Once we are fully online and running we will be paying the developers [/B]for their previous work done, and then from there on. Right now we are in our Pre-Alpha Stage, Scheduled for an Open Alpha Release Soon.[/COLOR]</p>
