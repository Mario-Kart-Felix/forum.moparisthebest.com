<p>Yeah… I forgot about the Israel war and everything. That was quite a catastrophe. All wars are I suppose. You are referring to the Israel-Labanon war of course right since it’s recent.</p>
<blockquote>Hezbollah militia:
<p>Dead:<br>
~250 (Hezbollah claim)[6]<br>
≤500 (Lebanese officials’ est.)[7]<br>
~500 (UN officials’ est.)[8]<br>
~600 (IDF est.)[9]<br>
Captured: 13[10]<br>
LCP militia: Dead: 12<br>
PFLP-GC militia: Dead: 2<br>
Amal militia: Dead: 17</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(little off topic)Compared to the Iraq war, that’s nothing. I was reading in the papers here the Iraq death count has gone way passed it’s early mark (100,000) and now it’s somewhere around 110 or 120 thousand dead. And the 3,500 total Americans dead. Comparatively, it seems like the Iraq war has been much much more brutal.</p>
<p>And (back on topic) the Jihadis, what I know from reading the news, have been killing at least 20 or so people about every time they suicide bomb any place. And they release these guys every day! Every day I hear about another bomb blown up in Israel. And each time it’s another 20 or so people.</p>
<p>I have probably read this same kind of suicide bomb story so many times that the total number of people dead due to Jihadis must be in the 10,000s if not, higher. That’s just from the Israel bombings. Not counting the bombings in India that I used to hear about and still hear about every once in a while.</p>

<p>Well, that’s one point of view. “Blowback”. That’s what I learned in college and shit, but I’m not sure if I believe that. You know what the alternative is, it’s self-evident. False flag operation, essentially. But whatever, I’m not qualified to ponder out loud, anyway.</p>
<blockquote>About the Jews. What? lol. Whenever I read about the Jews in the news or in books, it's always them getting fucked this way or that way. I actually say from all of America's work in the Middle East, and the Muslim terrorists we Americans created have killed many many many people. These terrorists keep blowing up bombs in Israel, India, Pakistan, and thanks to the new war, Iraq.</blockquote>
<p>Well the US buys Israel a whole lot of shit and gives them the latest military technology. Israel disregards human rights codes, bombs senselessly in areas where civilians are (in response to “Terrorist” attacks against her civilian population, as if fighting fire with fire is going to solve anything) and has nuclear weapons further destabilizing the Middle East. If aMmuslim goes into a pizza parlour in Israel and blows himself up it’s terrorism, but if an Israeli jet drops a laser guided bomb into a home in Lebanon it’s collateral damage?</p>

<p>We started the whole Jihadi movement. During the Cold War, America (CIA, etc) established hate schools to train the Jihadis to kill Russians. After the Cold War was over, we left the hate schools there. And what did they do? They kept creating more and more terrorists, and it backfired.

              <p>On the subject of the CIA preventing terrorism, in my view the CIA <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> terrorism. If you take a look at the origins of the modern radical Islam movement you can see it originated in Afghanistan to fight the Russian occupation. Pakistan was used essentially as an arms depot by the CIA to fund the Mujahideen, “Freedom Fighters” who were fighting the evil communists. Russias disastrous war in Afghanistan helped ferment the failure of the soviet Union. Now the Mujahideen became…guess who? Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda is blamed for being connected with any “Terrorist” attack that appears on the news in the US, yet in reality most of these groups are not connected to any central planning and it is simple propoganda. More people are killed in the US by peanut allergies than terrorism, and the Jews kill more innocent civilians and fuck more shit up in the middle east than any Muslims.</p>

              <p>Naw they do have a lot to do with preventing it though. Think about it, besides spying and recruiting agents, the CIA is basically trying to get as much information as they can.

<p>But I;m glad you are going to check it out. So many people now days do not bother to read and I thought you might have said something like “I don’t like to read Ron.

<p>There is a really sweet factual book I read titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/See-No-Evil-Soldier-Terrorism/dp/140004684X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-9593439-9077600?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1183959071&amp;sr=1-1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-i">See No Evil</span> by Robert Baer</a>, an Ex CIA agent who shows how things lead to the 9/11 attacks. It goes really far in depth and is just an awesome book. If you want some facts, read that book.</p>
<p>It shows how the CIA has been slowly being crippled by political correctness among other things. I don’t want to give away everything so just check out the book.</p>
<p>They also made a movie out of it called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365737/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Syriana starring George Clooney</a>, but I suggest reading the book first because otherwise you won’t get the movie.</p>

              <p>Maybe, but the only thing that I found most fishy about 9/11 was how Bush continued to read a children’s story for 10 or so minutes after finding out that there has been a terrorist attack when we are living in the Nuclear Age. He didn’t know if it was a plane attack or a nuclear bomb. And he chose to stay in the elementary school to read “My Pet Goat” to the children.</p>

              <p>There is some sketchy shit about the plane that hit the Pentagon.</p>
<p>First, the Pentagon has a multi-tiered missile defense system and radar. Did this just fail to work? The plane hit the pentagon an hour after the strike against the twin towers and Andrews air force base is right next to the pentagon. There are multiple squadrons of jets on call all the time to protect the area. Were they not scrambled above Washington DC?</p>
<p>Second, Dick Cheney had knowledge of the plane flying in from miles away. This is documented in a video of Norman Mineta testifying before the 9/11 commission. Norman Mineta was fired from the Bush administration the day after somebody mentioned this on Fox News. Dick Cheney must have decided he didn’t want the plane shot down.</p>
<p>Third, the terrorists flew right by a nuclear power plant to get to the pentagon. Crashing a plane into that would have caused much more damage than hitting the wing of the Pentagon that had no top brass in it and was under construction.</p>

              <p>Oh ya Flair, that’s an old one. Truth be told, I believed it for a really short period of time, but it’s like 1/4 of the people in the states believe it was some type of conspiracy. Reason I put it up there, because it was entertaining to watch, but I did believe it at first. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Then I said it was just another pissed-off jihad Arab who didn’t want America on his soil (Afganistan, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and now… Iraq) and didn’t know much else except to kill innocent people.</p>
