    <title>[pi] hand cannon problem please help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-hand-cannon-problem-please-help/390190</link>
    <description>im currently fixing my hand cannon.
I fixed it is now so it is a 2 handed weapon but..,
it attacks like a whip and does not shoot cannon balls out of it it attacks as a melee weapon but i want it 2 shoot like how it normally shoots.
does anyone know how to edit the animations for it in the client and if u do what is the animation number.
If you could help me with this that would be great and what folder would it be located.. in the client.</description>

<p>You’re problem doesn’t lie in the client, its to do with the server. Unfortunately tho, the had cannon is 530 revision(i think) and PI is 317, the correct animation’s and gfx’s wont be added.<br>
If you want to know how to change the attack animation, open up CombatAssistant.java and serch for:</p>
<p>switch(c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon]) {</p>
<p>You will see lines of code like this:<br>
case 4153: // granite maul<br>
return 1665;</p>
<p>That means, Item ID 4152 used animation 1665 to attack with.<br>
You cant add the cannonballs firing out (unless you rip the gfx out a 530 client)</p>
<p>GL ^.~[/quote]<br>
wait do u know the animation codes for it tho…? and so its impossible to add a hand cannon 2 a 317 pi?.. as u can i see i’m still confused</p>
