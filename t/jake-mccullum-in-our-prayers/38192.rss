    <title>Jake McCullum, In Our Prayers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jake-mccullum-in-our-prayers/38192</link>
    <description>Jake McCullum was an up and coming rider through the ranks of 85cc racing. But, on the 27th of September, he was critically injured. He fractured 3 vertebrates in his neck. His Uncle and Family made a video for him. I don&#39;t know Jake, but I know his friend from Motocross.com.

Here&#39;s the video:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mhEmzXGVq4

He has made some progress since the accident with movement in his arms, not yet able to move his hands, but has feeling in them, also has some lower body feeling which are all great signs.

Pray for Jake.

- All for 64</description>

<p>Shut up you idiot… riding crappy little bikes makes you a cowboy … lmfao.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hey dipshit. Get your fat ass off that fucking computer and go listen to the song called “Cowboy In Me” by Tim McGraw, which is where that line came from. Riding crappy little bikes doesn’t make me a cowboy, but you saying that makes you a dumbass. What in the fuck is wrong with everyone nowadays? You’re all acting like a bunch of niggers, the world don’t owe you shit, stop being mad at everything and anything for no reason.</p>
