    <title>[PI] Need to fix veng | Already got lunar interface to not freeze</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-to-fix-veng-already-got-lunar-interface-to-not-freeze/450777</link>
    <description>So basically, I&#39;ve already gotten the lunar interface to not crash your client when you open it. But now when I press veng w/ runes in my invent it freezes me. I&#39;ve been searching for about an hour on these forums, and another one &amp; haven&#39;t found anything. Could someone help me by sending me the link to a tutorial or telling me how to fix this? I&#39;m using a cleaned out PI</description>
