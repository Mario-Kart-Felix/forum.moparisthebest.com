    <title>Pay for top ad and get scammed?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pay-for-top-ad-and-get-scammed/547637</link>
    <description>Simplexus paid $475.00 for top ad this month for it to be hacked? All of the links on our ad were changed to &quot;perfectionx&quot;. I don&#39;t know how long this has been going on for but I am appalled that we&#39;ve payed this amount of money for our traffic to be detoured to another site. How did I get hacked? My moparscape password is unique, and yet, it was still the same for me to log in with after our ad got sabotaged. Something needs to be done about this..

<p>Have a delightful life, provided that’s a possibility given your degree of malice toward life.</p>

<p>It’s been nice having your site as a primary ad Steven. I will not be the last one to cease using MoparScape because of Yoddle, use the thousands of dollars we’ve put forward as incentive if you have to. Farewell sir.</p>

<p>Pfft, dude, move on.</p>

<p>I’m honestly sorry the fight has interrupted your business,<br>
I can guarantee it won’t ever happen again to any of your sponsors.</p>

<p>If you have a popular server or a sponsored spot, you need to keep your password, security questions/answers, and your email password and security questions/answers safe, or this could happen to you too.</p>

<p>This is completely ridiculous man. We pay for your ads every month and all you can offer me are your condolences.<br>
This is the last time we pay &gt; $150 for an ad here.[/quote]</p>
<p>You mean they changed it, you logged in with your old password, changed it to a new password, changed it back and then they changed it again?  If so, do you think you might have a keylogger or something like that?</p>
<p>I’m searching through logs to see if I can find IPs of anyone editing your server.</p>
<p>edit: If you have time to chat right now you can join the IRC, either with your client or the ‘CHAT’ link up top.</p>
<p>edit2:<br>
I’ve done some more digging to make sure someone couldn’t edit your server without actually logging in with your password, and since the whole system is open source, I can show you that they must have been logged in:</p>
<p>register2() is the function called when editing or registering a server:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/moparisthebest/Server-Status-Page/blob/master/ss_sources/register.php#L23" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://github.com/moparisthebest/Server-Status-Page/blob/master/ss_sources/register.php#L23</a><br>
it calls the forceLogin() method, which can be found here:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/moparisthebest/Server-Status-Page/blob/master/ss_sources/util.php#L77" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://github.com/moparisthebest/Server-Status-Page/blob/master/ss_sources/util.php#L77</a><br>
If you are not logged in, it shows the login form and exits, which stops the server from being edited/registered.<br>
Back to register2(), if all the other checks pass, even the SQL query itself is limited to only be able to change the server belonging to the user currently logged in via UID:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/moparisthebest/Server-Status-Page/blob/master/ss_sources/register.php#L87" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://github.com/moparisthebest/Server-Status-Page/blob/master/ss_sources/register.php#L87</a></p>
<p>So, long story short, the only way anyone can edit a server is if they are logged in as the user who owns the server, so I’m fairly confident someone has your details.</p>
<p>If they don’t know the password itself (though it seems like they do), they can reset the password if they have access to your email or know your secret question, do you know those are secure as well?</p>

              <p>Simplexus paid $475.00 for top ad this month for it to be hacked? All of the links on our ad were changed to “perfectionx”. I don’t know how long this has been going on for but I am appalled that we’ve payed this amount of money for our traffic to be detoured to another site. How did I get hacked? My moparscape password is unique, and yet, it was still the same for me to log in with after our ad got sabotaged. Something needs to be done about this…</p>
