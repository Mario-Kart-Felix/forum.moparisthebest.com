Before you read any further!

If you&#39;re looking for your typical &quot;OMG i can run around and spawn shit and pk and get 2147000000 gp instantly and win and be a bad-ass and spam and fucking this is awesome server&quot;, this isn&#39;t the server for you. We don&#39;t want you here, go find a different server. 
Like most other servers, I encourage people to join forums. It&#39;s not required unless you want staff, though. 

Skype is my main method of communication. You may add me: Username = &quot;GhostedRebel&quot;

I will ban immature fucks who CBF&#39;d to follow simple rules, and I will NOT tolerate mayhem and disorder. I want mature players here, and I will not hesitate to ban/mute/ipban/ipmute any player who break my rules.


This is not your typical server, at least not in the sense that players will be able to ::pickup, or ::master/::pure.

The exp rate is currently set to 40x for Range, Mage, and Melee. The rest of the skills are at 10x, usually, the exception being harder to train skills.

Staff is given in this method, and no other.

Players who want staff must earn it.
You will be required to have at least 24 hours of in-game play time.
You will need to demonstrate superior maturity, grammar, spelling, and friendliness.
If a new player joins my server, I want to see them welcomed!

Staff may not PK below their ranks. Breaking this rule is considered grounds for a demotion.

Admins PK admins
Mods PK mods
Players PK players
If staff wants to pk, they must make a new account.
__________________________________________________

There will be drop parties at milestones for amounts of players online

	
	100
	150
	200
300
Drop parties will have some rare items, caskets, random items, shit items, and other TBD items. 
______________________________________

Your commands will be simple..

__________________________

Your current commands - ::players, ::changepassword, ::pkp,
				:rules, ::gambleinfo, ::resetdef, ::afk, ::staffrules
				::withdraw, ::save, ::display, ::resetdisplay, ::home

Rules you will be expected to follow are these!


				1.Do not ask for staff or items. Ever.
				2.Pk at your own risk!
				3.Being rude to fellow players is not allowed.
				4.Scamming is an instant IP ban.
				5.Do NOT BOT OR AUTO IN ANY WAY.
				6.Be courteous to your fellow players.
7.I see everything. You have been warned.
_____________________________________________________

Donating is what it is. It&#39;s optional!  I may or may not add more content for this in the future. I don&#39;t plan on it at the moment, because I&#39;m not doing this to make money, I&#39;m doing it to have a fun community where I can relax, and make a place as such for other players.

              <p>[quote=“Team_Rocket, post:5, topic:459358”]I feel bad for my post. Here’s some friendly advice from me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Too many buttons. The Money Pouch button is not only a useless feature, but is also a sign that the Base has followed tutorials, or has been leeched completely. This feature does NOTHING useful except to save an inventory space. In my day, having the cash in your inventory was a part of earning it - not hiding it in some silly interface-esque button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’d just completely remove the Minimap button and Money Pouch all-together. Then move the Experience Counter (useful and wanted), to where the Minimap button was placed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are all of your Client Tabs functioning? This is very simple and easy to do. If you’re going to use a Modern Client, then you might as well take full advantage of those tabs: Achievement Diary, Notes, Music, ect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Editing your Hitpoint and Prayer statistics don’t look good for when you’re advertising your Server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posting how you will not hesitate to ban anyone doesn’t look good. Some people might think you’re doing this for a power trip.              It also subtracts from your professionalism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your method of recruiting Staffers should be different. People have used the method you’ve posted ever since R.S.P.S. began.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop parties for online players might seem great at the time, but this is NOT how you want to introduce anything into your economy. Having all Monsters drop a different rare item with a VERY low chance every 24 hours; alternating; would be good for a few days to pump some rare items into your economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want my take on Commands? Players shouldn’t have any at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Experience rates are WAY too high. People will move on from this once they have nothing left to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Rules you posted for your Server are a joke. Your players will walk all over these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You say that the only Donation rewards are Party Hats… Due to Item Duplication? You are saying in your advertisement that your Server has Item Duplication problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t take pictures of Shops… AT ALL. A screenshot of great content is worth 1,000 words. Yours say about 3 words to me: “I edited Configurations”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re going to line up a large amount of N.P.C. side-by-side, then at least have them facing different directions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can keep doing this all day long.[/quote]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Damn. Thanks, Team Rocket. First server, and of course I’d have problems. &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>Going to take all of this into consideration.</p>
<p>Thanks Ruby.</p>
<p>I obviously have a lot to fix.</p>
