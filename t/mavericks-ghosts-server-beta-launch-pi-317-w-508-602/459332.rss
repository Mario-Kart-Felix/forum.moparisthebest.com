    <description>Title pretty much says it all.


First of all, staff is only given to players with at least 24 hours of in-game playtime; with good grammar, and high maturity levels. I myself am very mature, so this won&#39;t be a 12 year old running this server.

I will have it online as much as possible, and I&#39;m probably going to get VPS soon.
I will keep updates coming, when I&#39;m not heavily loaded with schoolwork.

This IS NOT an easy server. You will not get every item within 10 hours, you WILL work for skills, and money won&#39;t be easy to come by. 
There are not ::pure, ::setlevel, or ::master commands for regular players. They are admin only, and admins are REQUIRED to use the command ::master upon promotion.\
Pking is for regular players. Mods may only pk other mods, and admins pk other admins. If they want to pk with lwoer ranks, they must create  a new account.
