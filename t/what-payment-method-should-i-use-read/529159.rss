<p>This. I bought gold once that was never delivered, opened a dispute, and the china-man who scammed me emphasized on this, and paypal didn’t care so I lost that $20 lol.</p>

              <p>This seems like an extreme workaround, but you can include in the ToS that disputing a payment is instantly a permanent ban from the game.</p>
<p>I don’t know if you actually ‘need’ the $800, but if they were serious about donating it in the first place there’s no reason they will dispute it… Unless they play for a while, and once they’re done they dispute it.</p>
<p>I’m not really good with the legality of these things, I’d love to hear what more people have to say so I can learn a bit</p>

              <p>[quote=“Loveandpower”]Here is probably thbe example of the way I have my set up</p>
<p>Below are the fill in the blank options in my paypal ( not sure if there is a limit on a regular paypal)</p>
<p>-In Game Name<br>
-Forum Name&lt; — if you  are getting forum donor rank<br>
-Item you want (will be automatically filled in because you choose via donation button ), the image though shows that specific item.<br>
-A brief tos is shown on the paypal screen (merchant paypal ability I believe )<br>
–the tos pretty much just says that by donating to this specific paypal account you acknowledge  that you are  the owner of the game account(s) and that you are the owner of the form of method. (aka credit card etc ) . You also add something in the tos ON PAYPAL that you do not give refunds of no kind nor do chargebacks are acceptable. State that all chargebacks will be held and represented in a court of law and that by clicking  submit payment you understand this legality.</p>
<p>(considering its on the paypal it pretty much covers your own ass )</p>
<p>now…when paypal tries to  get your side of the story.</p>
<p>Start off with something like</p>
<p>To the Paypal Representative,</p>
<p>Thank you for alerting me of this attempted chargeback/take back of a gift. Here at blah blah gaming company. We have a very strict system in place for gifts. Now write in here the system.  Below are the valid sets of proof as proof  that this person was on the game at what time.</p>
<p>-Creation log date and time &lt; — give an image<br>
-Proof of the filled in in game and forum name.<br>
-image that corresponds in an in game picture of that account with the item that was bought.<br>
-=trade logs<br>
-pretty much any type of log or image that can back up that this person did play for 1 week or more.</p>
<p>-end of proof -</p>
<p>Here at blah blah gaming company we take pride in the satisfaction of our game. Those who give us GIFTS understand that there are no chargebacks of items when they are first bought (as stated in the tos on our site and in the paypal buying page )</p>
<p>We would like to appeal this chargeback and hope you give us your full support in this matter. If there is any other proof that you need to be shown let us know and our billing department will get back to you asap.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>blah blah<br>
-head of billing blah blah game<br>
phone #<br>
email</p>
<p>pretty much make it look professional. good ideas to try</p>
<p>-require donors to give an image on forums of the transaction. upload the image to a site of your own and keep a record of it. When paypal tries to take it back you can show this as proof as well  that hte person listed in the forum  did buy this with that specific transaction number.<br>
-I can’t guarantee every case will be won because even I lost a few in all honesty but what I can tell you though giving more proof helps your case. I also suggest that you do an inagme picture chat of the guy   giving you the last 4-5 digits of the transactiom number before you give the item.[/quote]</p>
