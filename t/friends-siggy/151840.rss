<p>Lol, go check your rates. You gave the noobiest sig a 7/10.<br>
And what? calling people noob? That’s merely an insult. Like you can do any better, your rate everybody above 6+/10</p>
<p>Man, just shut up. I can make a better one with this sig. YOU did 3 THINGS!!!<br>
Even without the effects he put up it would still look god, dumbfuck.</p>
<p>EDIT: BTW, tbh, the sig is pretty good, but it has not alot of things on it. I know you like it, but I am critiquing. This is the section for critiquing.<br>

I never even posted in this section before.<br>

              <p>[quote=“ThAt0n36Uy, post:13, topic:151840”]I read it, and I respect what you said, I do agree, the little bastards that post in here who have no real talent take it upon themselves to waste space in a topic with an inflated rating that means nothing. Which in turn sends the wrong message to the creator of the work, who otherwise might would have worked harder at it. But now because of their ridiculous post, has given up, and possibly moved to another community.</p>
<p>But I don’t care what you say about it being OK to flame anyone, Exe is a very prominent member of this community, wether he has those awards or not. He’s important to the Graphics community itself. Not only that but he is very active, and for the most part always has been.</p>
<p>I don’t suck, I am indecisive on the way you and Exe have chosen to rate images. I do agree with you that it should be rated on what was done there, but it should also be rated on how it flows with the rest of the signature. I think a final product shouldn’t only be rated on the way the text is done, text can be changed fairly easily. Though it does affect the overall flow of the signature. IT shouldn’t be the sole determining factor. A signature should be rated on how well the Focal Point is presented, and the other aspects of the signature. Including the amount of brushing, and the way the render or stock was manipulated, as well as the Text effect used in conjunction with the rest of the Signature. It should also be rated in a category, if someone makes a Vector signature, it is most likely to be rated on simplicity.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to another point, Whether the Creator is a beginner or a veteran should matter also, it should affect how the person is rated. I agree, your rating was just, but you took it to personal by calling his friend retarded, you don’t know specifically the ability of that person.[/quote]<br>
Holy shit… I said that?<br>
Look, man I don’t hate you, I’m just mad. I hate being called upon like that EVERY SINGLE CRITIC I MAKE!<br>
I’ll try being a bit more softer now.<br>
I’ll start again, and edit my post. But I will still criticize, but leave off some hard points.</p>
<p>kk?</p>
<p>EDIT: Alex, dude. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that much. Right now, I just realized I’m making more of a mess by calling your friend “retarded”<br>
Ok, re-rate with hard points off but with one part I do agree with:</p>
<p>8/10 for appearance, but effort, meh, 6.5/10?</p>
<p>Appearance is a bit good, but it lacks some effort.</p>
<p>Effort:<br>
First off, it lacks any comparison towards actually being a true tag, tbh.<br>
It lacks any depth, and proper lighting. The city stock should be blurred and Spiderman should be sharpened to the point in which he can stand out properly. Next, the colors are under saturated. The text is horrible, and lastly, it doesn’t blend <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

Including the amount of brushing, and the way the render or stock was manipulated, as well as the Text effect used in conjunction with the rest of the Signature. It should also be rated in a category, if someone makes a Vector signature, it is most likely to be rated on simplicity.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to another point, Whether the Creator is a beginner or a veteran should matter also, it should affect how the person is rated. I agree, your rating was just, but you took it to personal by calling his friend retarded, you don’t know specifically the ability of that person.</p>

<p>Lol, go check your rates. You gave the noobiest sig a 7/10.<br>
And what? calling people noob? That’s merely an insult. Like you can do any better, your rate everybody above 6+/10</p>
<p>Man, just shut up. I can make a better one with this sig. YOU did 3 THINGS!!!<br>
Even without the effects he put up it would still look god, dumbfuck.</p>
<p>EDIT: BTW, tbh, the sig is pretty good, but it has not alot of things on it. I know you like it, but I am critiquing. This is the section for critiquing.<br>

<p>Nator, you’re a little fag, and just insecure about your own work, and make fun of others work because yours is so terrible. In fact, it’s more than that, you just think by flaming you’ll get instant approval from the other members of the community, and you were thinking right, there are alot of immature members here who would agree with you just because they like to flame. But you made a mistake, you flamed the wrong person, by flaming exe, you most likely offended more than half of the community.</p>
<p>The fact you act so big and bad just furthers my point, I doubt you could make any intellectual argument towards my post, the only thing you would even attempt to do is try to retaliate with cuss words and calling me noob, etc. Which won’t work, it just shows you’re weak, and truly are insecure, and that is why you resort to putting down others.[/quote]<br>
Hmm, what type of title does exe26 have?<br>
Of course, the SOTW and GRAPHICS MASTER<br>
So what, it is only a god damn title. It would be wrong doing it to Administrators, but SOTW and GRAPHICS MASTER? Give me a god damn break.<br>
And I am not making fun of other peoples work. I am basically criticizing. And with the flaming… You think that every single time everybody should get a big “HURRAY, THANKS! THAT’S REALLY GOOD!!!”?<br>
Over 50% of the population does that, when stuff are crap. Man, don’t get me started with how annoying that can be. A lot of people did below average work or w/e, and they get a GOOD JOB!!!<br>
If they say it’s good, it should be good. If it isn’t good, it is bad. Most likely there are no “Average.”<br>
bad or good, pick one and that’s what it goes by.<br>
Man dude, you really suck. And, there is no such thing as “FLAMING THE WRONG PERSON” unless it’s an adminisitrator of what, something huge. I wouldn’t care if I flamed the admin of this comm, cuz it aint that big.</p>
<p>Man, give me a REALLY DECENT post where I did something wrong. I have to agree with it, and I’m honest.</p>
<p>EDIT: Why post this, you probably aren’t going to read it anyway.</p>

[/quote]Don’t rate by the work put into it, but by the appearance. Good god. Who told you people how to rate?[/quote]<br>
Lol. First off, it lacks any comparison towards actually being a true tag, tbh.<br>
It lacks any depth, and proper lighting. The city stock should be blurred and Spiderman should be sharpened to the point in which he can stand out properly. Next, the colors are under saturated. The text is horrible, and lastly, it doesn’t blend <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>And yes, it should be rated by the work put into it. How about he just copied it, and just added one thing, and call it theirs.<br>
Even though he didn’t, he needs to put more effort in it. It plainly looks like like effects on Spiderman, and put a city in the background. Not enough dude, not enough.</p>
<p>That good enough, noob?</p>
