    <description>[b]What is Rs2DV?[/b]
Rs2DV has been around for some time now, not many people have been developing it because it i nothing like original Winterlove servers, infact it&#39;s nothing to do with winterlove. The conventions used to create this source are very well done, hopefully we will inspire new members to use and enjoy this new private server as much as I have building it up to good standards.

[b]Why are you releasing?[/b]
As explained before, we would love it if moparscape members will start to use this source as a started base, it will take some time for you to get used to all the different objects and so forth but you will be able to pick up on it soon enough.

[b]What do I need?[/b]
You will need to follow some simple steps that I will be providing you at the bottom of this thread, the main &quot;program&quot; used to run this server is Apache ANT, there is no point in me explaining but it&#39;s pretty staight forward.

[b]Can you provide us with some details of the server?[/b]
[i]Sure.[/i] The server was first created by Verak, from there on many people started developing the server in till the project just failed. Although, it still has a sticky position on this forums and possibly get&#39;s a lot of traffic daily yet no one really builds off this server no more, what I have done with this is add most of the needed things that are not avaiable with the original Rs2DV server.

The main feature Rs2DV does not have is player saving, I have added this within this server and I have added a lot more, here&#39;s a little list.

[code]
- Basic clustering and thread pooling by Thiefmn.
- Fixed ground item pickup for stackable items.
- Added a bunch of stuff for fletching.
- Fixed the delay between hitting &quot;Log out&quot; and disconnection.
- Added player group functionality.
- Added membership flag functionality for later use.
- Added/updated Mining featuring delayed runnables.
- Added/updated Woodcutting also using delayed runnables.
- Termination of skill events if inventory is full.
- Protection against spam clicking skill events.
- Stops any running events if the user walks away.
- Added item on object packet.
- Added friends list and PM sending
- Added gem cutting for Crafting skill.
- Added agility
- Added saving/loading binary player saves
- Added/updated Thieving with more exact specifications. Still need combat stuff to finished it.
- Started on trading, still some more left to do for next release.
- Updated teleporting with animation/graphics that cancels walking points upon arrival.
- Started basic work on level up interfaces, not yet completed.
- Save/loading/acknowledgement of privacy settings. PM privacy still needs to be added.
- Documented the Player class.
- Added some skill menus for the skill buttons.
- Wielded weapon names show up on the attack tab.
- Added asynchronous database interfaces
- Revised some of the file loading classes.
- NPCs are loaded at startup from file
- Randomly move every so often
- They won&#39;t wander away from regions
- Most NPC packets are there for your convienience
- Fully working bank system, pretty much flawless
- Both bag to bank, and bank to bag
- Working insert/swapping of items
- Withdraw as item OR note
- Full player equipment system
- Correct item slots for most items
- Ability to wield/unwield items
- Won&#39;t lose your weapon when you wield another of the same type
- Full moving/reorganization of inventory
- Items &quot;dropped&quot; will delete
- Ability to store items in bank and wield
- Convenient class full of skill IDs
- Ability to get XP amount for specific skill number
- Ability to add XP amount for a specific skilll
- Herblore with potion creating
- Unfinished but a good start of Thieving
- Teleporting via Magic to most destinations
- Bone burying
- Flawless energy system
- Player design screen
- Variety of great debugging commands
- Completely free of winterlove-named stream methods
- All additions to the server [/code]

[b]What client do we use?[/b]
You can use any client you want, although I will be providing you with a spacific client very soon. The features will be basic, same as the server and then you can build off the client and server and hopefully create a very succesfull server!

[b]Special thanks[/b]
I would like to thank some people for some of the tutorials that helped me build this.

[b]Setting up the Rs2DV server on Windows XP and Vista OS[/b]

First download apache ant from [url=http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi]http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi[/url]
Put that foldar into your C:/ and name it apache so it looks like this

[img]http://img380.imageshack.us/img380/8949/ss20080628162602nn2.png[/img]


and basicly all you will need to do is
[img]http://img235.imageshack.us/img235/2045/ss20080628162000sm2.png[/img]

then go to 
[img]http://img235.imageshack.us/img235/746/ss20080628162128tx6.png[/img]
[img]http://img70.imageshack.us/img70/4671/ss20080628162234hp9.png[/img]

Make your Path to
[code]C:\apache\bin[/code]
So it looks like
[img]http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/9469/ss20080628162338gt5.png[/img]

Now in your RS2D foldar put a batch file called compile with the stuff of
[code]
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_05
C:\apache\bin\ant -buildfile .\build.xml
pause[/code] inside of it that will compile the rs2d souce
and make a run.bat with this inside of it

[code]@echo off
ant run
pause[/code]

[b]Client we recommend[/b]
The client is currently in development, we are trying our best to remove any known bugs.</description>
