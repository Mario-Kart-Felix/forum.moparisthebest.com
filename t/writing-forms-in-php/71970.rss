    <title>Writing Forms in PHP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/writing-forms-in-php/71970</link>
    <description>The whole code, a simple code, Would look like this..   [sample]
[code]
&lt;form action=&quot;nextstep.php&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
 What is your Favorite Book?: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;book&quot; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 What is your Favorite Song?: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;song&quot; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;[/code]
Fist off, make sure you end the code with the &quot;&lt;/form&gt;&quot; tag!
Next where it says &quot;&lt;form action=&quot;nextstep.php&quot;&quot; That is where it is going to take you after you submit your query. For that part to work write you would have to have &quot;nextstep.php&quot; file in the same spot that you have your page that shows this. If not, they you would have to put the complete URL to the spot it&#39;s taking you..
The &quot;method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&quot; is what you want the code to do.
What to add into nextstep.php will be added in later in the tutorial!
The first question I am asking is &quot;What is your Favorite Book?:&quot; You could change that to anything. But if you do, Make sure you change the &quot;name=&quot;book&quot;&quot; (change where it says BOOK).
Same for the second question.
To add in the button you would have &quot;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;&quot;.

Now, For the nextstep.php.
This code would look like this...
[code]Your favorite Book is... &lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($_POST[&#39;book&#39;]); ?&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Your favorite song is... &lt;?php echo (int)$_POST[&#39;song&#39;]; ?&gt;[/code]
I think you know what everything is except maybe the &quot;htmlspecialchars&quot;.
That checks to make sure any HTML characters are properly put in.
Also, Where it says &quot;$_POST[&#39;book&#39;]&quot; Change the &quot;book&quot; to what your variable for the first question is.
Same for &quot;$_POST[&#39;song&#39;]

[size=24pt]Guess What! You Just Made A Form![/size]

              <p>htmlspecialchars() doesnt check if the HTML characters are properly put in, but it encodes them <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
also, i recommend using htmlentities() instead, as it encodes ALL HTML characters with the same code, so it would not just encode &amp; ’ " &lt; and &gt;, but also the rest <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
also, why do you cast $_POST[‘song’] to an int? isn’t a song supposed to be a string?</p>
<p>anyways, nice basic tut <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
