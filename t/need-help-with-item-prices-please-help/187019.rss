    <title>Need help with item prices (PLEASE HELP)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-item-prices-please-help/187019</link>
    <description>Hi, I am trying to change my prices on some items in my shop, but it is not that simple. I want to make the prices the amount of another item. For example, I am trying to make a Granite Maul cost 50 Tokkuls (Item ID 6529). How can I configure this?

Summary: How can I make the price of one item the amount of another item? (Gmaul = 50 Tokkuls)

Any help would be appreciated. Please reply with any knowledge you have if you have viewed this post!</description>
