<p>Calls to finalize in Object doesn’t do anything. The spec says that it will only be called once and thats when it is no longer referenced. (Although it can make itself referenced again in which case when it again becomes no longer referenced it will be called again). I haven’t looked at the code but I assume ‘this’ doesn’t extend the java API in which case it shouldn’t be a problem as anyone who extends Script will know that finalize() can be called twice. Ideally you should incorporate into script code “if (dead) return -1;” which you would have to do anyway as finalize doesn’t stop the script’s execution. You should set all references to the script to ‘null’ in which case the script will simply disappear. If you think memory is an issue you could call System.gc(); afterwards. In my opinion its bad practice to make that call and should be replaced with an abstract (so they have to put in cleanup) method called stop() so they can do all they need to do.</p>
