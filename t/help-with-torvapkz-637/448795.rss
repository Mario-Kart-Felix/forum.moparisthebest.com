    <title>Help with torvapkz 637</title>

    <description>Alright so I have been changing drops and drop% but when I look at a boss that has a rare drop rate at 100% I try to add that onto another monster like the minions at Nex.  I make a new drop and I call the item ID Rare like in Nex&#39;s drops and it changes to -1.  I really cant figure out how to make the drops listed rare as Nex&#39;s are.  If the drop% is what makes it rare or not that would be good to mention.  Thanks for reading this and hope you could help me. :)</description>
