<p>I mean recycling methods, not half-assing it. Why do work that does not need to be done right? Its like getting a car, and you need a new heater hose. Your heater core is not new, but its not really bad, and just replacing it even though it would work fine. Bad analogy, but I hope you get what i mean.</p>

<p>Or just replace the loading bar colors with images, and remove where it puts then text. Not everything made by Jagex, cause at that point your re-writing methods that could have been saved.</p>

Well its al very nice ideas, and i agree about rounding the corners, the one problem with will be is the annoying white spots that will show up, becouse cutting it correctly is very hard.</p>
<p>Also about the effect, i can make it change colors at specific times, like when its at 35% or  36% or anything like that, but if i would make an animated gif image of it, the image would look really bad, like in that gif vid thingy i posted[/quote]</p>
<p>True, true…All though, you could add a fade-in fade-out effect.  Kind of like the new runescape loading background how it fades in and out to new images.  You might be able to make a piece of code for this.  One that changes the transparency of the loading bar at different times.  Or maybe even the background.</p>
<p>so like in the public void startup</p>
<p>loadtimer++;</p>
<p>then somewhere declare:</p>
<p>if(loadtime == 5){<br>
(would use an image code to load a new background/loading bar frame here)drawImage(background2);<br>
} else {<br>
if(loadtime == 6){<br>
drawImage(background3);</p>
<p>Just using that as an example.  It might possibly work if you tweaked it a lot.  Yet for now, your client is impressive.</p>

And yea i know it likes freezing up, but thats becouse some methods just take time to load, cud make it the loading bar draw inside those methods tho, so it will be less freezy :). But making it auto move wont work either, the problem of it always moving is, that some pcs load slower bcuz they are just not that gd, then the loading bar wud be full b4 it is even loaded!</p>
<p>EDIT*<br>
made the bar ALOT smoother and got the client to load triple as fast as b4 :3<br>

              <p>uhm yea the animation to it, like make it a gif file? so the picure always moves? And yea i know it likes freezing up, but thats becouse some methods just take time to load, cud make it the loading bar draw inside those methods tho, so it will be less freezy :). But making it auto move wont work either, the problem of it always moving is, that some pcs load slower bcuz they are just not that gd, then the loading bar wud be full b4 it is even loaded!</p>
<p>EDIT*<br>
made the bar ALOT smoother and got the client to load triple as fast as b4 :3<br>

              <p>[quote=“wolfs goal, post:7, topic:367959”]I like this, but it isn’t that great.  Maybe if the loading bar moved more smoothly instead of freezing up, like you know, how runescape buffers the game engine at different speeds.  Maybe if you added an animation to the loading bar, kind of like what Microsoft does when it has the green oval-rectangle going accross and has a flashing line go through it.  It would distract the user from the stopping/starting loading of the bar and make it look more presentable.</p>
<p>Other then that, I would give this a 20/10.  I say this because this is very creative for someone to do this, also I like the new login look.</p>

this. I had the feeling of impatientness when I saw the loading bar freeze. Make it load more smoothly like wolfs said or add a small little animation to it.</p>
