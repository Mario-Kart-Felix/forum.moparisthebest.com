    <description>if(starter == 0){
   starter = 1;
   showInterface(3559);
   apset = true;
   addItem(717, 1);
   talk(&quot;Wake up!&quot;, 1);
OptionText: Ok
OptionText: Nah I&#39;m tiredd
If PlayerHandler Right = Ok Return GFX = 22.
If PlayerHandler Right = Nah Return GFX = 191.





What it&#39;s supposed to do is when you first create a new account, the screen will be black and a guy says wakeup! (in NPCX Dyelog) then it will ask wake up or dont. If you choose yes, the screen will slowly fade in to the game. Were would i put this script? It&#39;s for allstar. Also, If anything is wrong with this script, please fix.</description>
