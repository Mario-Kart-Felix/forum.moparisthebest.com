    <description>This guide is for meant for newer developers to the runescape private server community.

Difficulty? 1/10

[size=36pt]Quick note:[/size] About me:
I&#39;m a perl developer so I use snake case instead of camel case, out of habit if you don&#39;t like it, change it in your version, I develop a private server that will likely never go live and likely never be released, so I haven&#39;t cared to fix it. If i do decide to release it, and it&#39;s not hard to write a script to change snake case to camel case.

Alright let&#39;s talk politics real quick.
Many people in the Java community prefer System.currentTimeMillis() to Epoch because it&#39;s built in, I have a personal preference and tend to like Epoch better being a perl developer, I&#39;ll list reasons below. In terms of use, epoch saves you character strokes but you lose out on millisecond accuracy.

[size=36pt]Q/A[/size]
Q: Is this a copy paste guide?
A: No, unfortunately not. 

Q: Why would you teach this? What&#39;s your goal?
A: My goal is to teach you to use epoch, and stop using custom timers in process() at the same time.

Q: [b]What is Epoch? [/b]
A: Epoch is the the amount of seconds since 1970, Jan 1

Q: [b]Why would I ever use it?[/b]
A: Epoch is good for keeping time, even when your users are offline, and has a really positive bonus of keeping timers out of
[code=java]sub process() {[/code]

Q: [b]I already have a timer what is epoch good for?[/b]
A: Firstly to answer this question you have to consider that your code
[code=java]timer--;[/code]
is not better, it&#39;s highly inaccurate and latency can make your timer turn 500ms in to 518ms, not a huge deal, until it is.
Instead of keep track of a timer you can just keep track of the moment you can perform an action.

Q: [b]Isn&#39;t [i]System.currentTimeMillis() [/i] more accurate?
[/b]A: Yeah, if you need to be millisecond accuracy use System.currentTimeMillis()
But if you are using timer--; in your process() you probably don&#39;t care how accurate it is.
Also: I&#39;d like to pose this question. if you aren&#39;t doing combat related things, do you really need to be that accurate?

Q: [b]Wait you are using System.currentTimeMillis() to get your Epoch time;[/b]
A: Not a question, and oh shoot you caught me, I am cheating technically I am using System.currentTimeMillis() and dividing by 1000;

Q: What&#39;s the difference?
A: Epoch is System.currentTimeMillis()/1000, so you can can save character strokes, instead of typing 1000 for 1 second, you use 1, or if you want 60 minutes, 3600, instead of 3600000, in my mind that is easier to manage and keep track.
[i]We live in an age where developer time is more expensive then hardware.[/i]

Q: [b]And what&#39;s the difference code wise?[/b]
A:
System.currentTimeMillis()
[code=java]
    if ((System.currentTimeMillis() - lastAction &gt;= 1000) &amp;&amp; !IsMining) {
[/code]
Epoch
[code=java]
    if (epoch_now() - lastAction &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; !IsMining) {
[/code]



Let&#39;s get in to the code it&#39;s self you don&#39;t need to import any libraries this is all core.

1: you&#39;ll need 3 new subroutines epoch_now(), date_to_epoch(), epoch_to_date();

[code=java]
    public long epoch_now() {
        return System.currentTimeMillis()/1000;
    }
    public long date_to_epoch(String date) {
        //date format: 01/01/1970 01:00:00
        long epoch;
        try {
            epoch = new java.text.SimpleDateFormat(&quot;MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss&quot;).parse(date).getTime() / 1000;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            //Should probably fail... Instead of setting it to now...
            epoch = epoch_now();
        }
        return epoch;
    }
    public String epoch_to_date(long epoch) {
        return new java.text.SimpleDateFormat(&quot;MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss&quot;).format(new java.util.Date (epoch*1000));
    }[/code]

often times you will see this
[code=java]
long lastAction = System.currentTimeMillis();
[/code]

Instead use
[code=java]
long lastAction = epoch_now();
[/code]


the concept is you can make specific actions only available every so often.

So often times on the old delta servers you would see something like this on objects
[code=java]
if(objectID == 190 &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - lastAction &gt; actionInterval){
    WalkTimer(0, 2);
    actionInterval = 10000;//10 seconds
    lastAction = System.currentTimeMillis();
}
[/code]

you could convert to something like this
[code=java]
if(objectID == 190 &amp;&amp; epoch_now() - lastAction &gt; actionInterval){
    WalkTimer(0, 2);
    actionInterval = 10;//seconds
    lastAction = epoch_now()
}
[/code]

as long as you are not constantly needing to display a timer you could do something like this

assuming you set pcNext when the game ends
[code=java]
    int pcTimeBetween = 180;//3 minutes
    int pcNext = epoch_now()+pcTimeBetween;
[/code]
[code=java]
    sM(&quot;Game starts in: &quot;+(PlayerHandler.pcNext-epoch_now()));
[/code]

Instead of keeping track of the timer and constantly update it.
[code=java]
    sM(&quot;Game starts in: &quot;+PlayerHandler.pcWaitTimer);
[/code]


Once you have gotten it figured out a bit more, you can start saving these epochtimers to your character and when you login, do some math and figure out if it&#39;s been 5 minutes since you last prayed, teleported, killed a daily boss, or set up an energy system where you restore energy every 25 minutes with a maximum of 5.</description>
