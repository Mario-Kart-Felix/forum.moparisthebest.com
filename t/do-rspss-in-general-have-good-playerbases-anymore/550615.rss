    <title>Do RSPS&#39;s In General Have Good Playerbases Anymore?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-rspss-in-general-have-good-playerbases-anymore/550615</link>
    <description>Alright, so I&#39;ve been contemplating about actually committing to a project since it&#39;s been a couple years since I&#39;ve done anything useful in the private server realm. My question is, would it be worth it to even bother? I see in this community the only ones really trying are the late-joining newbie&#39;s who are convinced they will &#39;change the server community forever&#39;, and it&#39;s always the same shit. Yet when people come out with original ideas, nobody seems to play them. Would it even be worth trying to host a server? Or is this shit just here for (deconstructive) learning purposes?</description>

I honestly can’t entirely agree with this. At first, yes private servers will fade. However, I could see a push as the need for nostalgia kicks in and servers pop up for those who used to play it, can enjoy it once more.</p>

<p>To be honest, a lot of people in RSPS (or at least who do nothing to contribute and more to play) are the ones that have left RuneScape or even taken a break from it so that they can find something that is easier and make more of an accomplishment than what they could have done from RuneScape. So as years have gone by, I think that need has only gotten worse as people from RS have found some of the updates to be either ridiculous, doesn’t make sense, or hard to follow.</p>
<p>Your best bet MIGHT be from like a 30-60 playerbase and you can probably allow them to accept your ideas and move forward a bit.</p>

</aside>
<p>That player base honestly that awful, I remember back in the day when I was helping develop some google base and the owners were satisfied with a 20 player average, (which also resulted in me still getting paid), so I mean that’s not awful based on the fact that I consider failures servers with 5-10 people on every couple of days…[/quote]</p>
<p>20 players is good. obviously you always want to improve, and 20 is a great player base to build onto</p>

              <p>I’m not entirely sure</p>
<p>On the one hand, the vast vast majority of people who play servers are generally people who care more about stroking their ego than do actually playing the game. It always makes me cringe when I see people call getting lucky with a random number generator ‘skill’ of any kind.<br>
A lot of the people who host/own the servers know little about programming and just want the money or sense of power over something involving other people.<br>
And a lot of people who develop could care less about the efficiency of their code or about fixing the broken features of the server and making it actually worth presenting.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it’s a community I don’t ever really see dying. I’ve seen forums for games that are well over 10 years old since people stopped talking about them and they still get more new people.<br>
It’s also been like this since I started liking private servers 5 or 6 years ago now. It’s always going to be kids developing, running, and playing these things. If you like developing them, then go ahead and make something of decent quality and it’ll further the community that much more. But if you want to move on to making games and applications that will be properly appreciated, no one will blame you.</p>

              <p>Well, people are smarter these days and try to find better servers which actually are good coded. These days it looks like the playerbase is less because there are just more people getting involved in to making RSPS. It<code>s not a bad thing that more people start learning Java. But the fact is, the more servers there are the less players there will be on one server. See it like a cookie. cookie 2 kids. You both get the half. But if you have 8 kids each one will only get 12,5% of a cookie. And than there are still a few Huge servers like Ikov, soulsplit etc. I actually think more people play rsps these days as there are about the double amout of servers (not real statics, but its a fact that more people made servers). These days people aswell release "good" servers which people leech. No one needs the knowledge of Java these days to make a Semi good server. For example, PI, everyone loved it. People kept leeching it and before you even knew it there where 200 servers from the same source. A 6 year old can start hosting his own "leeched" rsps these days. Do back to the question. No RSPS ain</code>t starving, the players are just all around all those servers.</p>

              <p>I think if you’re expecting a playerbase of around 30ish the I see why it can’t happen. However, if you’re expecting to have the huge playerbases that the likes of Soulsplit or Ikov have then you shouldn’t really bother unless you have huge funds going towards your server (even though their playerbases are nowhere as big as they used to pull).</p>
<p>But remember, as RuneScape itself fades, so will private servers.</p>

              <p>Alright, so I’ve been contemplating about actually committing to a project since it’s been a couple years since I’ve done anything useful in the private server realm. My question is, would it be worth it to even bother? I see in this community the only ones really trying are the late-joining newbie’s who are convinced they will ‘change the server community forever’, and it’s always the same shit. Yet when people come out with original ideas, nobody seems to play them. Would it even be worth trying to host a server? Or is this shit just here for (deconstructive) learning purposes?</p>
