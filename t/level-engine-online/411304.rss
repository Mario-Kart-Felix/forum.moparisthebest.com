    <title>Level Engine Online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/level-engine-online/411304</link>
    <description>Because both Frell and Taharok wanted me to join this forum, I finally said yes after some heavy thought, and I was then asked to show my development progress of a game I&#39;ve been working on for a very short time. It&#39;s being made in C# and uses XNA 3.1.

The reason behind me wanting to not announce this publicly is because there&#39;s really no point, and my work typically starts to fall back after I show it. However, since I&#39;m really feeling good about this one, I guess it won&#39;t hurt.

So this is a remake of a game that was originally created based off of maps my cousin and I drew that we called &quot;Levels&quot;. It basically featured a character venturing through a single map Metroid-style with the aspect of Zelda games. When we decided to turn it into a real game, we used Game Maker and after a lot of time remade one of our maps. Looking back, it wasn&#39;t too shabby, although it was too cluttered and became tough to work on.

Now, my goal with this project is to create a smooth multiplayer engine featuring the above stuff with tons of enemies, weapons, and most of all, possibilities. Rather than just being a game with a level to play and that&#39;s it, I&#39;m creating an engine with it all and later programs to create custom maps. The project will also be open-source.

Currently, I&#39;m the only programmer, and that&#39;s how I want it to stay. I don&#39;t know anyone who can write code like I do and I dislike working in programming teams. The only help I&#39;d like to eventually get is someone to get me sounds and graphical resources. I am writing the engine from scratch, because I like having full control over everything and I don&#39;t have to worry about any licenses if I decide to take this project to the next level.

So I&#39;m guessing you probably want screenshots. Everyone does. The problem is I don&#39;t have any actual content past the basic 2D stuff, so you&#39;ll have to bear with me.

[img]http://img830.imageshack.us/img830/228/screenqt.png[/img]

The &quot;62 FPS&quot; actually means &quot;60 FPS&quot;. It only appears as 62 because of the division and rounding done. But yeah, 60 FPS with over 5000 objects and pixel-perfect collision I&#39;d say is a fair ground to start off. The number is an animated sprite that cycles from 1-8 with it set to change 60 frames per second, black means not touching anything, red means touching something.

Anywho, there&#39;s my little development topic. Expect more, I suppose. And if you want to try this, download it [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?xs36vn1nz88ads1]Here[/url] once you have the [url=http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=15163]XNA Framework 3.1 Redistributable[/url] and the .NET Framework 3.5. Left clicking pauses the animation and right clicking increases the scale size from 1-4x.

[b]To Come:[/b]
-Actual content
-Possible particle engine
-Shader support for fun effects like scan lines
-Fully defining an object&#39;s mask
-A custom image format that includes an object&#39;s mask and all animations (Far in the future)
-Online support

[i]Note: I did not proofread any of this.[/i]

              <p>Just so this isn’t another failed development topic, I am still working on this. I’ve been very busy these past few days and have only had a few chances to work on it, but I’ve improved some stuff and started working on actual game content. Right now you can move the character up/down slopes, jump, do other fancy moving, and swing your dagger. There will be MANY more weapons in the game, and the dagger won’t even be the first, but it’s a starting point.</p>

Like I said, it’s got the aspect of Zelda games.</p>

              <p>Because both Frell and Taharok wanted me to join this forum, I finally said yes after some heavy thought, and I was then asked to show my development progress of a game I’ve been working on for a very short time. It’s being made in C# and uses XNA 3.1.</p>
<p>The reason behind me wanting to not announce this publicly is because there’s really no point, and my work typically starts to fall back after I show it. However, since I’m really feeling good about this one, I guess it won’t hurt.</p>
<p>So this is a remake of a game that was originally created based off of maps my cousin and I drew that we called “Levels”. It basically featured a character venturing through a single map Metroid-style with the aspect of Zelda games. When we decided to turn it into a real game, we used Game Maker and after a lot of time remade one of our maps. Looking back, it wasn’t too shabby, although it was too cluttered and became tough to work on.</p>
<p>Now, my goal with this project is to create a smooth multiplayer engine featuring the above stuff with tons of enemies, weapons, and most of all, possibilities. Rather than just being a game with a level to play and that’s it, I’m creating an engine with it all and later programs to create custom maps. The project will also be open-source.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m the only programmer, and that’s how I want it to stay. I don’t know anyone who can write code like I do and I dislike working in programming teams. The only help I’d like to eventually get is someone to get me sounds and graphical resources. I am writing the engine from scratch, because I like having full control over everything and I don’t have to worry about any licenses if I decide to take this project to the next level.</p>
<p>So I’m guessing you probably want screenshots. Everyone does. The problem is I don’t have any actual content past the basic 2D stuff, so you’ll have to bear with me.</p>
<p><img src="http://img830.imageshack.us/img830/228/screenqt.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The “62 FPS” actually means “60 FPS”. It only appears as 62 because of the division and rounding done. But yeah, 60 FPS with over 5000 objects and pixel-perfect collision I’d say is a fair ground to start off. The number is an animated sprite that cycles from 1-8 with it set to change 60 frames per second, black means not touching anything, red means touching something.</p>
<p>Anywho, there’s my little development topic. Expect more, I suppose. And if you want to try this, download it <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?xs36vn1nz88ads1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here</a> once you have the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=15163" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">XNA Framework 3.1 Redistributable</a> and the .NET Framework 3.5. Left clicking pauses the animation and right clicking increases the scale size from 1-4x.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">To Come:</span><br>
-Actual content<br>
-Possible particle engine<br>
-Shader support for fun effects like scan lines<br>
-Fully defining an object’s mask<br>
-A custom image format that includes an object’s mask and all animations (Far in the future)<br>
-Online support</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Note: I did not proofread any of this.</span></p>
