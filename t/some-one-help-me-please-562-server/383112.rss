    <title>Some one help me please? (562 server)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-one-help-me-please-562-server/383112</link>
    <description>Hello, I am trying to make a 562 server. I have a source and client with not much on it, and I came to the realization that I suck and can not code at all. Anyways I can host it most likely about 20-7 since I have  a laptop that I never use. Will someone please help me, It mostly just needs some more shops and tellies and its good to go. You will definitely be an owner and I would really like to try and keep this server up for a long time, Thanks.</description>
