    <description>(317 SERVER) BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING PLEASE READ THE BOTTOM. AND YOU MUST HAVE SKYPE. IF YOU DON&#39;T YOU CAN&#39;T BE ABLE TO JOIN. IF YOU THINK THATS MEAN IT&#39;S BECAUSE WE&#39;RE GONNA HAVE A TEAM MEETING..

Hi guys.. So I have recently been searching for a good team that I can join but I can&#39;t find anyone one of em (that are good).. What I want to do with you guys is make a team.. Not a big team but a team that we can rely on each other. FOR THE SOURCE we are going to get a source we would all agree on. I think that&#39;s the same with you guys too. (REQ ARE ON THE BOTTOM. Oh and overall everyone here will be owner.. That do favor..)

Host 0/1 (THE HOST WILL NEED A VPS AND HE WILL ALSO BE GETTING DONATIONS BECAUSE HE&#39;S THE HOST.
Coder 0/2
GFX 1/1 (me)
Website 1/1 (me)

Req

Name: Optional (Not really important..)
Skype: (NEEDED)
Age: Optional (Don&#39;t care if your 8 or if your 40)
Job: (NEEDED)
Experience: Optional (As long as you know how to do it..)

One more thing.. Don&#39;t play stupid on me.. I hate it when people do that. IF YOU HAVE anymore questions I would love to answer them :). I will be checking everyday and I&#39;m on skype everyday. Well hope you join. Cya :)


OH AND ONE MORE THING. WE WILL THINK OF A NAME TOO. AND IF YOU REALLY WANT A TEAM.. IDC WHY THIS IS BAD (NOT IF YOU DON&#39;T HAVE SKYPE)</description>
