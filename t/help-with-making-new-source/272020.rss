    <description>Hello there! My name is Taint and i am looking for a blank source to use, and code on. I have heard testscape is good, but i could not find any links for this. If you could find a link to a good blank source, or pretty blank source(no commands ect) i will give u Rep++. Also one more question, i am looking to add&amp;remove monsters and npc once i get a good blank source. How do i put these monsters in, add hp and drops, and if i want to make an npc a shop how do i do so? Please post with an answer to one of the two questions or both. Thank you very much!-Taint</description>
