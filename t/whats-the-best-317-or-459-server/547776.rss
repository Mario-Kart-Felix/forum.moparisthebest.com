    <description>Coming from RSC. Trying to play around with rs2 code. Whats the most stable 317-459 release?
I tried Revival-RS and the code was a mess.

Edit: Hope this post is within the rules because I&#39;m not asking for anyone to provide source or help. Just recommend the most stable release no need to spoonfeed me any info about running the server etc.</description>

Apollo is one of your best options. I’d say Hyperion or Rune-source would probably be next.<br>
PI is the most popular 317 base and also one of the worst options. It was horribly designed and every time someone released their version of the server, the code just seemed to get worse and worse. So now it’s just a pile of crap these days.<br>
Delta… Not really a good one out there. I’d avoid it and PI…<br>
And any other 317, can’t really think of. So.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks guys apollo is very stable and is exactly what I was looking for. Is there any additional info I should know about apollo or any useful threads on mopar? (Not asking for hand holding just and threads you would recommend)</p>
