    <description>Hey Moparscapians,

I got a problem concerning my webclient. Okay, It works perfectly fine but when I try to upload it to my website it gets the &#39;unexpected error - retrying in 10&#39; error. Here is a link showing you what it is doing. [url=http://royalscape.clan.su/Webclient/Webclient.html]http://royalscape.clan.su/Webclient/Webclient.html[/url].

Here is what I did to upload:
 -uploaded cache to fileden
 -uploaded client.jar to my website
 -uploaded certificate.exe to my website
 -uploaded webclient.html to website

Did I miss anything or do i have to have my cache on my website so its the same directory as the client or do i have to edit the html page? Or What? I don&#39;t know... Please Help!

Thank you!
