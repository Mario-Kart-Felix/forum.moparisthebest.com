        <p>So, what are your ideas on good people and evil people?</p>
<p>does one evil act brand you as an evil person for life? or vise versa, one good act brand you good for life?</p>
<p>Can a serial killer sacrifice himself to save a child, and in your eyes, would that redeem him?</p>
<p>I see myself as a good person. in the past Ive lied, i cheated and ive i stolen<br>
But i stand up for people, i have saved countless puppies and kittens when i volunteered at an animal refuge. I would push a child out of the way of traffic and get hit myself. I donate money when i can. I see a girl getting hit by her boyfriend then i will step in.</p>
<p>So, i consider myself to be a good person. My good deeds define who i am to myself. What i am, and what i strive to be. in  my mind, the ends justifys the means. Every bad deed i have done has been either preparing for, or lead to, a good one.</p>
<p>so back to the main point. Is someone truly good or evil? Can good dead cancel out a lifetime of bad ones? etc</p>

        <p>one good dead can never cancel out a lifetime of sins. Should a mass murderer decide to start donating to charity and volunteer to save lives he is still an evil person but his perspective on life has changed he is trying to redeem himself. One must say that no one is truly good or evil except those that condemn their lives to evil acts or good acts</p>

It still hasn’t changed.<br>
A mentally ill serial killer might think he’s doing a good thing to kill people.<br>
But still he will be punished by karma.<br>
The people killing the “witches” might think they were doing a good thing, but still karma will pay them back.<br>
That’s just how life is. Animals killing animals to surive. In return they get killed in their next life.<br>
It’s like an endless cycle.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/sanga282.html">@sanga282</a>, i dont know how you could blame something on karma?<br>
Karma helps me to overcome my problems. Whenever i face a bad situation in life, i just try to make it as good as possible cause i know whatever happened was my fault.</p>

What is good and what is bad always existed.<br>
And it’s not called good or bad.</p>
<p>If you enjoy killing people and then getting killed afterwards and you enjoy it. Then that’s something good for that person. But still karma has done its job, even if the person thought he did a good job killing someone.</p>

so your saying that right at the begining there was a very fine line drawn up as to what was accepted as good and what was accepted as bad? I dont buy that</p>
<p>what is good and what is bad changes all the time. Karma can only exists in your mind. How real you make it is up to you.<br>
Not saying its not real, but it cant possibly exist with the same line, for eternity. i can see it working per person, per time era, etc.<br>
[/quote]<br>
What is good and what is bad changes all the time in the people’s mind.<br>
What is good and what is bad always existed.<br>
And it’s not called good or bad.</p>
<p>If you enjoy killing people and then getting killed afterwards and you enjoy it. Then that’s something good for that person. But still karma has done its job, even if the person thought he did a good job killing someone.[/quote]</p>
<p>explain to me then why bad people get away with bad things. You cannot argue that that happens. And they dont always have bad things happening to them.</p>
<p>Karma is just a way of justifiying bad things happening to people you think have a reason to have something bad done to them. and a way for people not to take matters into there own hands because some mystic force will level the universe out.</p>
<p>dont get me wrong, im not saying its not there. but your doing a bad job of making a believer out of me. and i kinda believed in it before you started.</p>

        <p>difference being, that believing in the apocalypse is not a way of life.</p>
<p>Karma exists because people live there lives by it. Not because of any other reason.<br>
Same as religion. If people stop believing, it goes away.<br>
If an apocalypse was coming, belief or not, itd still come. Its got nothing to do with this topic.</p>

what if after saving sed person’s life you die? counter-productive dont you think? Also lets say you do something amazingly good and recently your life has been shit. Thats not likely to change, yeah you might get the odd good thing but it wont compensate. Of course people can beleive in it, it would be like me saying allah doesnt exist. Of course in my mind he doesn’t but to someone else it does. Karma is basically whatever you want it to be, its vagueness is what allows it to exist. If it were specific, then it would be instanlty ruled out.</p>

<p>it is totally relevant to my arguement. Just because you beleive it to be a way of life doesnt mean it will happen. If you save an old guy’s life and someone is planning on robbing you that same night regardless of whether you save that man and give him a car you are still gonna get robbed. Some people beleive in making all animals that don’t contribute to human’s well being extinct. Doesn’t mean it will happen. Its like trying to fit a map of a different town over your own by just walking around it, your mind will start making various simalarites that aren’t there, but yet you will still see them and remain fairly convinced it is the right map</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>that argument, while correct, is also flawed.<br>
My argument is also correct.</p>
<p>Believing in karma makes it exist to you. If you lead your life with the idea that if you do something good, youl get something good, then you will see it happening.<br>
Someone who doesnt believe will also see the same results. They just wont see them the same way.</p>
<p>You cant say that that karma doesnt exist, because it does. But only in the minds of people that believe it to be so.</p>
<p>If you go save someones life, eventualy something good will happen. Not because you saved the life, but because odds are, something good will happen to you eventualy. Whether you believe it to be because you deserved it, or because it was just luck, is up to you. Karma is a belief, not a fact.<br>
[/quote]<br>
what if after saving sed person’s life you die? counter-productive dont you think? Also lets say you do something amazingly good and recently your life has been shit. Thats not likely to change, yeah you might get the odd good thing but it wont compensate. Of course people can beleive in it, it would be like me saying allah doesnt exist. Of course in my mind he doesn’t but to someone else it does. Karma is basically whatever you want it to be, its vagueness is what allows it to exist. If it were specific, then it would be instanlty ruled out.[/quote]<br>
After you saved a person’s life and then you die, means you killed someone in your previous and now karma is paying you back. In your next life, you will be saved by a person. You understand what i’m trying to say?</p>
<p>Now this may sound really …umm fictional or like those “new age thoughts” or whatever it’s called.<br>
But i believe it and this is the most logical theory that there exists.</p>

        <p>I don’t understand what you’re trying to say.<br>
As i mentioned earlier, this has nothing to do with religion.<br>
This is MY theory, it’s not based on any religion.<br>
And you’re right, being reincarnated is not related to a persons luck, it happens wether you want it or not.</p>
