    <title>Good / Evil</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-evil/253281</link>
    <description>So, what are your ideas on good people and evil people?

does one evil act brand you as an evil person for life? or vise versa, one good act brand you good for life?


Can a serial killer sacrifice himself to save a child, and in your eyes, would that redeem him?




I see myself as a good person. in the past Ive lied, i cheated and ive i stolen
But i stand up for people, i have saved countless puppies and kittens when i volunteered at an animal refuge. I would push a child out of the way of traffic and get hit myself. I donate money when i can. I see a girl getting hit by her boyfriend then i will step in.


So, i consider myself to be a good person. My good deeds define who i am to myself. What i am, and what i strive to be. in  my mind, the ends justifys the means. Every bad deed i have done has been either preparing for, or lead to, a good one.


so back to the main point. Is someone truly good or evil? Can good dead cancel out a lifetime of bad ones? etc</description>

<p>I just used donating money as an example, in retrospect not a very good one. The point I am trying to make is that good involves a real effort, mental as well as physical; and this “effort” is very beneficial to the do-gooder.</p>

I wish it was this simple! At current I can't explain it very well .. perhaps I'll get lucky and people will just take my word for it :D but until then ..

<p>The problem is with England we’re too weak with criminals and to be honest, i think we should have the death penalty back.

He’s gone to prison for life, but is that enough? nothing’s going to bring those girls back! why should he still be here if he’s commited a foul crime, and by at least 2015 i bet you he will be released. Weakness. Agin i heard of an Liverpudlian gang member shot an innocent boy just becasue he was on “their turf” right by his house. Only gone to jail for 4 years.

<p>No.</p>

unless proved otherwise it does. You have no idea what that child perceives to be a monster, it could be some dust that caught the light or even a hanging for a wall. What you see as a broom for example, may just have a head and a handle, but who is to say that the child doesnt see the same broom as something all together more terrifying.</p>

in the same way that the kilogram, the meter and the second do not exist.</p>
<p>they are only things have humans have come up with to make it easier to measure, observe and control their lives.</p>

              <p>so do you agree with my logic or not?</p>
<p>if someone butchered your family, raped your daughter, ate your pets and then stole your car…</p>
<p>wouldnt you want them to pay? wouldnt you want them to feel the pain they inflicted? To suffer the horrors they where responsible for?<br>
Or simply lock them up?</p>
<p>i dont think locking them up is enough.</p>
<p>Also, ide want a new car</p>
