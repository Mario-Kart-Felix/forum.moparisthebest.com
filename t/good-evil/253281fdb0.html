<p>Who came up with the idea to use the word kilogram? Who came up with the fact that kilo means thousand, thus one kilogram being a 1000 grams? Who came up with the meaning, and the word gram? Why is one gram, one gram? It’s all defined by humans, and thus they only exist to humans.</p>
<p>Let a bunch of kids grow up completely separated from the rest of the world. Learn them some basic things, but nothing about measuring things. Also, give them two stones, and a piece of metal that weighs just as much as the two stones. Ask them how heavy the piece of metal is, and they’ll answer two stones. It only exists in to them.</p>

<p>If a child is scared because he thinks there is a monster under his bed, does it exist?[/quote]<br>
unless proved otherwise it does. You have no idea what that child perceives to be a monster, it could be some dust that caught the light or even a hanging for a wall. What you see as a broom for example, may just have a head and a handle, but who is to say that the child doesnt see the same broom as something all together more terrifying.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>If I killed someone, and got sentenced for life, I’d kill myself. It’s an easy way out, let the murderer have some pain, or at least pay back the costs for his cell. Labor is what he needs.</p>

        <p>Good and evil do exist and are very real things … but you have to reach a certain level before you realize this. I’m still trying to sort it out right now. The most important thing I can say, is that doing “Good deeds” like donating to charity, helping people in trouble, etc. do not make you “Good”. For starters, you can be “good” by improving yourself, not just helping others. Good is very much a mindset; being able to look around at the universe around you and being able to see the wonder and mystery in everything that exists. Evil is looking around at the universe and only seeing what you deem to be important. Think about this, for example: Everything around you (Literally around you right at this moment, in the same room you are) has a history. At some point it was created, and somehow it has managed to arrive where it is today. Who knows where it has been, what it’s experienced? In this respect, things like giving to charity are entirely superficial IMO. If you really cared about the people/things that are supposedly benefiting from your donation, you would be out there doing it. You would be seeing it first hand, and you wouldn’t be doing it because “It’s the right thing to do”, you would be doing it because you have found the fascination in these things.</p>

</aside>
<p>humans naturally only see what is important to them in the surrounding area, thats not an evil deed. Only seeing what you can manipulate to make your own life easier is evil. Good is simply just going that extra mile, you are toeing the line and also doing extra to make a difference. You might care so much about those people you are donating to, but there might be some reason you cant go and help them first hand. If you were donating to africa you cant just take a month off work to go and help them as your life would suffer and then the donations, from you to them, would cease. Meaning you are probably doing more damage by going there. Yeah while you’re there you might help the odd person but it wont be as simple as it sounds. Good is simply doing something to help someone else end of story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>humans naturally only see what is important to them in the surrounding area, thats not an evil deed</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s true this is human nature, but that doesn’t make it not evil. Alot of human nature is evil, that’s why the world is so screwed up.</p>
<blockquote>Only seeing what you can manipulate to make your own life easier is evil. Good is simply just going that extra mile, you are toeing the line and also doing extra to make a difference. You might care so much about those people you are donating to, but there might be some reason you cant go and help them first hand. If you were donating to africa you cant just take a month off work to go and help them as your life would suffer and then the donations, from you to them, would cease. Meaning you are probably doing more damage by going there. Yeah while you're there you might help the odd person but it wont be as simple as it sounds.</blockquote>
<p>I just used donating money as an example, in retrospect not a very good one. The point I am trying to make is that good involves a real effort, mental as well as physical; and this “effort” is very beneficial to the do-gooder.</p>
<blockquote>Good is simply doing something to help someone else end of story.</blockquote>
I wish it was this simple! At current I can't explain it very well .. perhaps I'll get lucky and people will just take my word for it :D but until then ..

<p>We tend to avoid bad emotions, and seek for the good ones. That’s the difference.<br>
People who tell you that good/bad does not exist, are just people who try to act smarter and more original than they really are.</p>
