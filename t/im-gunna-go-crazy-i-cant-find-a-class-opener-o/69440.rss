    <title>Im gunna go crazy. I can&#39;t find a .class opener :O!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-gunna-go-crazy-i-cant-find-a-class-opener-o/69440</link>
    <description> Well ok, lemme explain really quick for you. My computer/programmer guy in our town told me that the .3ds (3d images, like men, dragons, walls, etc) are in the .class files. They are like .xml files, or .rar files. They need an openener. (Like WinRAR for .rar). Within these files, according to the computer man, are .3ds and pixels for 2d/3d images in &quot;runescape&quot;. I was wondering if anyone had a clue on where to get one, (free :P), or if my computer guy was just ignoring me and wanting of me off his shoulders :P. Discuss :)?</description>
