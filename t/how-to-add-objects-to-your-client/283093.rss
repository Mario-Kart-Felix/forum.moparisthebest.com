    <title>How to add objects to your client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-objects-to-your-client/283093</link>
    <description>Hi guys, this is my first tut.

Step one:
Firstly we need a model.
Find an object model that is .gzip or .dat(if you use model preloading)
If you want to make your own model follow Cj&#39;s tut in the stickies in model section.

Add this model to your models folder.

Now the ints.

Open class46.java in your client.

I used these ints to replace a bed with a bed that was smaller so I could pinpoint the coords.

[code]	if(i == 5564)//This is the id of the Object (Not the model)
             {	
//Credits to Tatemo for working this out//
             class46.aStringArray786 = new String[5];//This makes a new first click string
             class46.aStringArray786[1] = &quot;Shop&quot;;//This is the first click name
//Credits to Cj for all Below//
	class46.anInt744 = 1;//This is the size					
	class46.anInt761 = 1;//This is also the size				
	class46.aBoolean778 = true;//Im not quite sure what these are
	class46.aBoolean767 = true;//Something to do with clipping   				
	class46.aBoolean762 = false;//And stuff like that play around				
	class46.aBoolean769 = false;//To find out what they do
	class46.anIntArray773 = new int[1];//Says that there is a new Model id
	class46.anIntArray773[0] = 0;//The model id				
	}[/code]

Basically the code above means that for the Object 5564 I am going to give it an option to Buy from it and Changing the model to 0 (Dwarf head), I am also making it 1x1 square large.

Hope I helped and please don&#39;t say I leeched from Cj because I know I did for all but one part the part that no amount of searching found for me. This.... 
             class46.aStringArray786 = new String[5];//This makes a new first click string
             class46.aStringArray786[1] = &quot;Shop&quot;;//This is the first click name

I little tut on the side for those who want extra knowledge.
You will notice in class46, class5 and class8 there are some codes like this.....

Class8:
[code]        anInt174 = 0;
        aString170 = null;
        aByteArray178 = null;
        anIntArray156 = null;
        anIntArray160 = null;

        anInt190 = 0;
        anInt198 = 0;
        anInt204 = 0;
        anInt169 = 0;
        anInt194 = 0;
        anInt199 = -1;
        aBoolean176 = false;
        anInt155 = 1;
        aBoolean161 = false;

        anInt192 = 128;
        anInt191 = 128;
        anInt196 = 0;
        anInt184 = 0;
        anInt202 = 0;[/code]

        anInt57 = -1;
        anInt58 = -1;
        anInt59 = -1;
        anInt61 = -1;
        anInt63 = 9;
        anInt64 = 1834;
        anInt67 = -1;
        aByte68 = 1;
        anInt69 = 9;
        anInt71 = -1;
        anInt75 = -1;
        anInt77 = -1;
        aLong78 = -1L;
        anInt79 = 32;
        aBoolean81 = false;
        anInt83 = -1;
        aBoolean84 = true;
        anInt86 = 128;
        aBoolean87 = true;
        anInt90 = -1;
        anInt91 = 128;
        aBoolean93 = false;
        anInt96 = -1;[/code]

Class46:

[code]        anIntArray773 = null;
        anIntArray776 = null;
        aString739 = null;
        aByteArray777 = null;
        anIntArray784 = null;
        anIntArray747 = null;
        anInt744 = 1;
        anInt761 = 1;
        aBoolean767 = true;
        aBoolean757 = true;
        aBoolean778 = false;
        aBoolean762 = false;
        aBoolean769 = false;
        aBoolean764 = false;
        anInt781 = -1;
        anInt775 = 16;
        aByte737 = 0;
        aByte742 = 0;
        aStringArray786 = null;
        anInt746 = -1;
        anInt758 = -1;
        aBoolean751 = false;
        aBoolean779 = true;
        anInt748 = 128;
        anInt772 = 128;
        anInt740 = 128;
        anInt768 = 0;
        anInt738 = 0;
        anInt745 = 0;
        anInt783 = 0;
        aBoolean736 = false;
        aBoolean766 = false;
        anInt760 = -1;
        anInt774 = -1;
        anInt749 = -1;
        anIntArray759 = null;[/code]

Now what you may or may not realise is that these are actually the variables you can put inside the ints.
The problem is no one as far as I know knows what all of them mean.
But I think there can be some big improvements/changes in ints if we learn what each of these are/do.
Now i&#39;m sure you can see how I worked out how to give my object a first click.
I looked at the one from class46 and went in class8 the variable that is first click item ends with an =null and is the towards the end so I assumed the variable in class46 would be towards the end and end with = null and I got it first try. For those who are blind here it is: aStringArray786 = null;
Straight out of class46.
Again I hope this helped you learn more about object ints and Ints in general and the possibilities for them.</description>

              <p>Rofl, I have no idea what you did. Your client should have that declared otherwise a lot of objects shouldn’t work. Try putting        <code>aStringArray786 = null;</code></p>

<p>Now what you may or may not realise is that these are actually the variables you can put inside the ints.<br>
The problem is no one as far as I know knows what all of them mean.<br>
But I think there can be some big improvements/changes in ints if we learn what each of these are/do.<br>
Now i’m sure you can see how I worked out how to give my object a first click.<br>
I looked at the one from class46 and went in class8 the variable that is first click item ends with an =null and is the towards the end so I assumed the variable in class46 would be towards the end and end with = null and I got it first try. For those who are blind here it is: aStringArray786 = null;<br>
Straight out of class46.<br>
Again I hope this helped you learn more about object ints and Ints in general and the possibilities for them.</p>
