    <description>Hey all.

My dad tryed to help me make a server but he didnt get a clue on any of it..
What i mean this weblink here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,285415.0.html
SUCKS!!!!! doesnt work he said didnt help at all!!

The most problem was the part were you pick what map/server you wont. didnt give a list of what best to use..

If you dont understand i&#39;ll get my dad to wirte an e-mail back to you so he can say what was fucked up.
