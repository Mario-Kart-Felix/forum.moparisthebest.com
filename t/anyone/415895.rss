    <description>Well, basically, in my school I am taking AP Computer Science. In this course we are suppose to learn:

- Java [I don&#39;t know how far in-depth though]
- Python (basics)
- Robotics/droid applications (using a GUI that uses Java I think?)

I feel as if I can use some tutoring from someone in this community. Basically all we have done in the past week is input a data value, it goes into a certain method, then prints it out.

Example:
[CODE]
import java.util.Scanner;

public class convertTemp {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		double faren = 0, celc = 0;
		Scanner c = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.println(&quot;Enter the desired Farenheit to be converted:&quot;);
		faren = c.nextDouble();
		celc = (faren - 32) / 1.8;
		System.out.println(&quot;Celcius: &quot; + celc);

	}

}[/CODE]

Now, basically I find this crap easy and simple. Is there ANYONE generous enough to offer me tutorials over skype or msn talk or something? I don&#39;t find reading tutorials easy, I find it if you explain the best you can while conversing, it becomes rather easier to me.

I want to learn something complicated, but something not to complicated. If anyone is generous to do this offer, PM me on here or add my msn: [email]patricknogaj@hotmail.com[/email]

Thank you ^^</description>

If you have learnt some use of graphics in Java you could make a simple paint program. Or even simpler you can implement a simple sort algorithm.<br>
PS: I didn’t see that as a giant project, sorry.</p>
<p>But an easy project with some size is good, as you build it up in baby steps.</p>

<p>I’m in high school taking AP Computer Science. I don’t think we go into that complex of programming, but I rather someone teach me via Skype or something relevant to that. I’m one of those people who get bored when they read tutorials over and over again trying to figure out the material, for me personally I think it’s easier to watch a video or someone explain it over Skype/ventrillo/etc. Also, yeah I know I didn’t learn enough yet, but I want someone to help me learn so I won’t be screwed in school. I want to be one step ahead, :3</p>

              <p>Theres still alot more basics that you need to learn and if you don’t have a solid foundation of the basics your gonna be screwed. I took AP Computer Science 1 and we didnt even get into polymorphisim, inheritance, error handling, swing until java II in college.</p>

              <p>Well, basically, in my school I am taking AP Computer Science. In this course we are suppose to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java [I don’t know how far in-depth though]</li>
<li>Python (basics)</li>
<li>Robotics/droid applications (using a GUI that uses Java I think?)</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel as if I can use some tutoring from someone in this community. Basically all we have done in the past week is input a data value, it goes into a certain method, then prints it out.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>[CODE]<br>
import java.util.Scanner;</p>
<p>public class convertTemp {</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	double faren = 0, celc = 0;
	Scanner c = new Scanner(System.in);
	
	System.out.println("Enter the desired Farenheit to be converted:");
	faren = c.nextDouble();
	celc = (faren - 32) / 1.8;
	System.out.println("Celcius: " + celc);

}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/CODE]</p>
<p>Now, basically I find this crap easy and simple. Is there ANYONE generous enough to offer me tutorials over skype or msn talk or something? I don’t find reading tutorials easy, I find it if you explain the best you can while conversing, it becomes rather easier to me.</p>
<p>I want to learn something complicated, but something not to complicated. If anyone is generous to do this offer, PM me on here or add my msn: <a href="mailto:patricknogaj@hotmail.com" data-bbcode="true">patricknogaj@hotmail.com</a></p>
<p>Thank you ^^</p>
