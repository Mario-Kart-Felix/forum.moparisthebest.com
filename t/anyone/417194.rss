    <description>Got a command for adding donor points or pk points to someone&#39;s account so i dont have to manually enter them and i dont have to use the char file any other interesting helpful commands you have please post a link or something here to them also i have a trade bug where when you accept trade with people you cannot move afterwards but if you decline the trade you can still move a relog fixes it but its still annoying. Also is selling runewire accounts on here allowed? I have a runewire spawner account which costs 75$ to donate for and i wanna sell it for some money back on it since i no longer play runewire.</description>
