Many other people have…<br>
There was one way I was able to fix it. I opened the character file, copied everything except the password and user name, had them make a new one, and pasted all the stuff into the new file. Sometimes the password gets corrupted etc…</p>
<p>Make sure to compile and restart in between character files</p>
