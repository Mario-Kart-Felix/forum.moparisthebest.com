    <description>i know neopets is stupid (sorry if i offended someone, its my opinion) but it seems like a good site to start writing scars, so im trying to write a dice-a-roo sript for my first script.  i have been looking at tuts and stuff but i can&#39;t figure out how to convert the dice into a bitmap so i can find it.  when playing dice-a-roo the roll buttons change coordinates so i cant just put in click commands i need it to find bitmaps and then go from there.  plz someone help me :)tips on what else to do plz post ty!</description>
