    <title>Intel&#39;s new &quot;Conroe&quot; Processors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/intels-new-conroe-processors/3768</link>
    <description>That&#39;s right Intel&#39;s making their new top-of-the-lin processors code named &quot;Conroe&quot; or Core 2 Duo...They will be making an extreme edition featuring 2.93 GHz and regular, 2.66 GHz. Although the clock rate and voltage has been reduced (to get rid of some heat), Conroe features wideeee execution pipeline, architectural optimizations, and a large, shared L2 cache(4mb for EACH core). Just a month before release, (I think date is July in the 20s) Intel let people put it to the test....So Tom&#39;s Hardware (http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/06/05/first_benchmarks_conroe_vs_fx-62/page5.html) Put it to the test against AMD&#39;s FX-62. Here&#39;s the setup, AMD processor using an Asus M2N32-SLI motherboard, with an MSI RX1900 graphics card built around the AIT X1900XTX chipset.

The test systems used an ATI-based graphics card built around the X1900XTX chipset.
Also Using DDR2-800, DDR2-933 SLI Ram DDR2-1016 SLI Ram and with the clock rates of 2.8, 2.8, and (overclocked) 3.0 GHz respectively, while the Intel setup is just DDR2-667 with the same Graphics card not sure what MoBo...From the looks of this  (http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/06/05/first_benchmarks_conroe_vs_fx-62/page5.html) It looks like Intel&#39;s regular Core 2 Duo (Not Extreme Edition) Even beats an AMD FX-62, DDR2-1016 SLI Ram, Asus M2N32-SLI motherboard, with an MSI RX1900 graphics card built around the AIT X1900XTX chipset Overclocked even to 3.0 GHz!! But remember this is a month before the release, and this is the plain Core 2 Duo edition so the specs could be better...</description>
