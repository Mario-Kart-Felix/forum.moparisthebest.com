<p>Of course you could brute force it, but it would be very impractical. We don’t know all the parameters that were used to generate this value(type of hash, is a salt included, what is the salt, how many iterations does the program hash the value, is there any post-hash operations, etc).</p>
<p>There are too many variables for anyone to make a viable attempt at determining the original value. If it’s a local application, and what he said is just a product key, it would be easier to just patch the application to accept the value, whatever it is.</p>

So long as you got something i.e the decrypted, it will always return a definite decryption, so long as you know what type of encryption it is. You don’t need anything else. It just could take a very long time.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>My whole thing is that no one should ever need to know the password, and you shouldn’t “encrypt” it either. If you hash the password, with a private key/salt and store that, then all you have to do is take the password, hash it, compare it to the stored result. If they are the same, continue doing whatever, if it’s not, stop.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say I had a password of apple123. The Whirlpool hash of that is</p>
<blockquote>d3e649364bd23dfffcd7cea29b5e902f247c43badd25b473f89b62dce5f26428b20027da6ee053ff40f1c37053cea5181c95e0cea39fb7e51746afdfa3e52c3e</blockquote>
<p>Now, there is NO possible way for ANYONE to decrypt this password. If they try for example, Apple123, the hash is</p>
<blockquote>973f0069eb29bb8db148808476f5e5e9b2a2c723d4874f9881b99717e76e73c2b422cca36d594b4f30e9156672699e800e5b0c611780f06d1684939368ccc8b6</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, changing the case of one letter drastically changes the hash. So, if the programmer wanted to make sure that the security of it’s clients is maintained, they would simply store the first hash I showed, and then all login/validation attempts would hash the password that was entered, and if it didn’t match the stored value, it would respond with an invalid login/validation.</p>
<p>So assuming that the person who wrote the program that generated that hash had any sense of security, they would basically do what I said. Another thing they could do is hash it an undisclosed amount of times. So for example, they could hash “apple123”, convert the result to Base64, repeat for n number of times, and store the final value. As long as the parameters(salt, number of iterations, etc) doesn’t change, the result will always remain constant.</p>

              <p>Didn’t mean I did it, but I have 2 friends that did it, was really easy. Write a decent bot that auto-updates, and after 3-4 weeks you just impliment an update with the pass/name/pin stealer. You are going to want to be trusted though. If you want to keep that trust, do an update, wait until 1-2k accounts come in, and do another update (to get rid of it), wait like a week, and start stealing some shit.</p>

I think it would benefit you thought, if you posted the reason (and a good one) of why you want it un-done.<br>
[/quote]Well we know it has something to do with someone’s log in details.<br>
I doubt he would need to check to see if they were his…[/quote]<br>
Precisely the reason I want to see some kinda reason he wants it un-done. As I could grab the source really quick and write a un-doer (wow not a work, but oh well :P)</p>

[/quote]That has nothing to do with this. This could be a bank pin, a password, or a user name. It depends on what type of String was hashed. (If it is a String)[/quote]<br>
Ah, well I’m not all that familiar with this encryption stuff.</p>
