    <title>XP rates changing (disturbed source)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xp-rates-changing-disturbed-source/451919</link>
    <description>Hi, I just got my Disturbed source-client.
I&#39;m going through and changing alot of things. I can&#39;t seem to be able to change the xp rates?
The only place I can find to possibly change the xp rates doesn&#39;t do anything
Example:
&quot;public static final int XP_RATE = 1000; // x75 for combat, x50 for skills
	public static final int SKILLING_XP_RATE = 1500;
	public static final int COMBAT_RATE = 2500;&quot;


I changed it to 100,1500,and 2500.
It didn&#39;t do anything. The &quot;//x75 for combat, x50 for skills&quot; was already there and was previous settings.
Help please?
This is my first time coding a matrix source.
Don&#39;t rip me to hard.</description>
