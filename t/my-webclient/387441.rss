    <description>Ok. I am using a 317 base (demise pking to be exact). I have gone through atleast 5 different tuts on making a webclient for a 317 base. Each time I have tried the tutorial they do. Everytime I try making it into a jar, it succeeds, but when I try actually opening the jar, the CORRECT loading screen pops up for like 2 seconds, and then it switches to that connection error with the 5 options on how to fix. Anyone have an idea as to why?</description>
