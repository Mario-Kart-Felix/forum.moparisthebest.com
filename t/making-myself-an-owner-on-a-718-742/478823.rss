    <title>Making myself an owner on a 718/742</title>

    <description>I&#39;m having trouble making myself an owner on &quot;Reduction 718/742&quot;.

Other&#39;s were having trouble giving themselves owner privileges but they figured it out. I on the other hand, did not. I&#39;m not a noob at this, but it&#39;s not as simple as just changing the previous owners name (which I already did). If anyone could help that would be amazing.

I wish the source came with a control panel.. Anyone know how I can make/where I can get one?

It&#39;d be easier to talk on skype so just message me: tylerpeterson45

Or, just post a reply to what you think I should do. Thanks!!</description>
