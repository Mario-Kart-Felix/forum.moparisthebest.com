    <title>Converting from Silabs to a new client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/converting-from-silabs-to-a-new-client/392540</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I host a very old server I created back in 2007 for a few friends. This was when Silabs reached its peak and instead of servers like PI, AllstarScape and Czar dominated the Server Status page. Anyway, Silab practically shut down her webclient and all of the models screwed up. Luckily a few had their hands on the downloadable version which has everything correct.

However, I want to create a new client and get off of Silab. The amount of creativity I have is shortening as I use up many of the main items.

My question is: How would I get the models of almost all of the items on Silab? I&#39;m not talking about things that are in practically every client (like rune scimitars and that). I&#39;m talking about items like skillcapes, godswords, and void/penance armor. These items have IDs such as 15185.

I know that I could rip the ints off of a Delta client or something, but for the items that another client doesn&#39;t contain (such as a Rune hasta(p++)), how would I go about efficiently adding these? I have close to 0 experience in clients.

The majority of them can be ripped from Delta, but I need a lot of treasure trail items (including sweets) along with penance armor and some other things.</description>
