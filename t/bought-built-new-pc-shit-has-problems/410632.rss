    <title>Bought+Built New PC, shit has problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bought-built-new-pc-shit-has-problems/410632</link>
    <description>So I bought a SuperCombo from NewEgg and I received it last night.

Here are the list of stuff:

ASUS Sabertooth 990FX AM3+ AMD 990FX SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX AMD Motherboard with UEFI BIOS

  		
AMD Phenom II X6 1100T Black Edition Thuban 3.3GHz, 3.7GHz Turbo Socket AM3 125W Six-Core Desktop Processor HDE00ZFBGRBOX

  		
Antec High Current Gamer Series HCG-750 750W ATX12V v2.3 / EPS12V v2.91 SLI Certified CrossFire Certified 80 PLUS BRONZE ...
	

Seagate Barracuda Green ST2000DL003 2TB 5900 RPM SATA 6.0Gb/s 3.5&quot; Internal Hard Drive -Bare Drive


G.SKILL Sniper 8GB (2 x 4GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) Desktop Memory Model F3-12800CL9D-8GBSR
	

Antec Performance One Series P183 V3 Black Aluminum / Steel / Plastic ATX Mid Tower Computer Case
	

LITE-ON Black 12X Blu-ray Burner with Blu-ray 3D feature SATA IHBS112-29 - OEM
	

SAPPHIRE 100312-3SR Radeon HD 6950 Dirt3 Edition 2GB 256-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 2.1 x16 HDCP Ready CrossFireX Support Video ...

So I go ahead and put this bitch together.  I finish up, (or at least I think so) i turn it on and all seems well.  I install Windows 7 to it, but it&#39;s a bitch, so it won&#39;t let me.  It&#39;s stuck on &#39;Installing Updates...&quot;.  It isn&#39;t frozen since the dots after it are proceeding to dot.
So I look it up and it seems that Windows 7 doesn&#39;t cooperate well with 2 sticks of ram, or above 6 gigabytes of ram, whichever, so I remove one of the 4gb ram sticks and reinstall Windows 7, and it works completely fine.  I&#39;m not going to put up with just 4gb of ram, so I insert the other ram stick back into it&#39;s slot.  I attempt to install the graphics card driver that came with it, and it worked just fine.  Windows Updates popped up, and one of the updates was an update for my graphics driver, so I install that, restart the PC, and then install WoW.  I launch this bitch and notice that it&#39;s extremely fuzzy/blurry, and searched it.  I did all that was asked (AA, etc) and it continued to be blurry.  Only the textures/models looked blurry, not the text or any part of the UI.

So then I downgrade to my old graphics card driver, the one that it came with, I do so, and I get a BSoD.  I thought it was just a coincidence, so I restart the computer and uninstall the current graphics driver.  I try to install the default driver again, this time I don&#39;t know what the fuck it does.  It says &quot;INSTALLATION COMPLETE&quot; or w.e it says at the end, but hasn&#39;t even installed the graphics card.

What the fuck is going on.  I&#39;ve redone all this shit like 5 times.

Also, booting up is extremely slow (right after the &quot;STARTING WINDOWS&quot; splash screen.  It wasn&#39;t slow before.  I don&#39;t know what is causing this.  I tried removing one of the ram sticks, same everything.

Help please.</description>

              <p>Yes, google a program called wdidle which modifies the firmware to either increase the time before the drive parks the heads or I believe you can also disable it completely (but get ready to dig out an old dos boot disk).</p>

              <p>The green drives have a firmware that puts them in suspension after a certain period of time when inactive. It takes a couple of seconds for it to boot up again, perhaps that’s the issue you’re having with freezing?</p>

              <p>i think i found the problem.</p>
<p>it seems that i wasn’t being careful, and i accidentally inserted one of the connectors from the other pin connector that was supposed to go to my other graphics card for crossfire, both into the slots.  I took it out and put in the connector along the side of the main connector and it seems to work.  Thanks to you I would of never guessed it was the problem.  Even if you didn’t directly help me, you gave me the idea that it might have to do with the connectors.</p>
<p>edit: no problems atm, fast boot now.  there’s still going to be problems, i’ll reply when they happen.</p>

              <p>The cable you described which you didn’t put in the GPU is most likely the CrossFire link cable, and you were right in not putting it in.<br>
However, most high end graphics card require additional power, and often have one or two 6/8 pin connectors either at the back or at the side.<br>
Check your graphics card if you have any of those slots, and plug in the appropriate cable.</p>

              <p>Yes, 64 bit windows 7 professional.  I decided to start from scratch again, deleting everything.<br>
I fixed the problem with the “installing updates” portion of the installer.  My ram had to be placed in specific areas of the slots, which I never knew since my other computers didn’t need this.</p>
<p>also <a class="mention" href="/u/sppt">@sppt</a>, i’m not too sure of what you mean.  I don’t have too much experience building computers, but it seemed everything went into it’s place, also I read the user guide for it.<br>
Are there extra power cables?  One of the connectors contained two little sockets, both go into one of my GPU’s.  It also had a very small wire with a small connector to the side of one of the main connectors, which i don’t know where that went so I just didn’t put that in.</p>
<p>Power Box came with another gpu connector, but I just assumed that was for if I crossfire’d/sli’d and needed to connect it to the other gpu.</p>
<hr>
<p>So I fixed my WoW problem by successfully installing the default graphics driver.  The problem that really pisses me off now is that now and then, my computer would freeze the fuck up, and all applications would freeze for about 5 minutes.  This happens about every 20-30 minutes.  I try to open My Computer, and the window just waits there loading everything, but if I wait long enough it can see the cd that is in the computer, and my connected external hard drive, and it also sees my local disk but it does not show the file size and info.</p>
<p>I think the problem is that the hard drive becomes retarded every now and then, but I really don’t know what the fuck is going on, and i’m disappointed as fuck on this $1.1k.</p>
<p>I’ll take a picture of the inside of my tower in a second.</p>
