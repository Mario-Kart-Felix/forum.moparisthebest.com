        <p>[quote=“yakman, post:56, topic:380290”]wtf? its been the leading story on BBC and Channel4 news for 2 days now. BBC Newsnight held a 20 minute discussion with leading interests represented.</p>
<p>I hope Egypt matures into a healthy democracy.[/quote]</p>
<p>2 days ago from your post date was the 27th. I started reading about Egypt on like the 23rd or 24th. The BBC website has a few news articles from back then, but hundreds of articles are brought onto news sites daily that only a few people read. By mainstream I was referring to the television channels and the fact that nobody I know had heard anything about it (including friends, parents and other relatives all/most of whom watch the news - literally everyone I met the past few days I’ve <em>tried</em> to mention this to. So many blank faces).</p>
<p>I’m intrigued by the terminology “healthy democracy”. Could you tell me any country in the world right now that actually has a “healthy” democracy? To me democracy is flawed, not as badly as a dictatorship… but it doesn’t work any better in the corrupt form it currently exists as.</p>
<p>EDIT: Please tell me that wasn’t really on Fox. I hope that person got fired, seriously how can a country mislabel Egypt as the country they’ve been at war in for near enough the past decade.</p>

<p>The US helped the nation of Egypt, apparently before their president decided to become a dictator a few days ago.  And now the US government is urging Mubarak to stop using force on his own people and hold democratic elections or the US will cease aid.  What else could we possibly do?

<p>Nor should they accept that.  I just heard on the news Egypt shut down the Internet all over the country to try and stop this revolt.

<p>Yup, cos when the people you didn’t vote for become president, the opposition really go around with guns shooting people. You have guns, you’re just to scared to use them.[/quote]</p>
<p>That doesn’t make any sense at all.  We respect the results of fair elections, just like any democracy should.  We have held elections, and people have won and lost many times over the past 200+ years, and there has never been armed revolts from the losers.  So your statement is just ridiculous.</p>
<p>[quote=“Greeny, post:48, topic:380290”]The human race will probably destroy ourselves along with our planet, and you’re more bothered about artifacts from the past?</p>
<p>Regardless of whether those were important parts of history, those people are alive now and being oppressed by dictatorship government.  Even if we don’t destroy ourselves the sun will swallow us in ~5 billion years destroying everything we ever created and erasing our existence (unless we get off this rock) so don’t be so naive. Those objects don’t matter, arguably neither does our existence or anyone else’s’ but we should be allowed to live in freedom.</p>

<p>“Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.”  It’s a good quote that has held true throughout the years, so the past and artifacts do matter, to an extent.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:56, topic:380290”]MITB: Defending yourself with guns is a nice idea but I see problems. Please tell me what you think.<br>
The government will have better weapons. In Egypt’s case they would presumably bring out tanks onto the street. I wonder if you would support giving people RPGs, grenades, or high explosives to combat this.</p>
<p>Equally one could argue that revolution is not necessary in a nation governed by its citizens. If a true democracy is in place one would wonder what the citizens have to fear. The US is unique among democratic nations in apparently having the idea that democracy requires an armed citizenry - why is democracy deemed to be so fragile in the US that it is felt to need this protection?</p>
<p>It’s interesting looking at recent history. No people has used guns to replace an authoritarian regime with a liberal democracy. Guns were irrelevant in the third wave of democratization that swept Latin America, Eastern Europe, and East Asia from the 1980s throught the 1990s. Indeed, widespread ownership is no obstacle to authoritarian rule, as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other countries with “gun cultures” demonstrate.</p>
<p>If I’m honest, I find the hunting and self-defence arguments for guns more compelling.[/quote]</p>
<p>The government will probably have better weapons, but the sheer numbers would be in favor the people every time.  From what I have heard about Egypt so far, the army appears to be on the side of the people, as opposed to mubarak or the police.  But either way, tanks are very effective against other tanks or defenses such as forts and such, they aren’t so effective against groups of spread out militia in a guerrilla war environment, plus people have a lot of ingenuity, and could figure out how to disable tanks if and when the need arises.</p>
<p>I agree with you on the second one, in a true democracy, as long as everyone follows the rules, revolution would not be necessary.  I believe the founding fathers of the USA found armed citizens a requirement of a democracy because of where we came from.  At the time, in England, people supposedly had ‘rights’ and such, but at any time the king could overturn any of them and take away those rights, and to combat this type of thing ever happening in the future (like it is in Egypt right now), everyone should have a means of protecting themselves, their families, and their liberties.  As I said before, an announcement like Mubarak made would never happen in the USA while we all have guns, because no politician would be stupid enough to do it.</p>
<p>Yes, please do look at recent history.  In basically every case of a tyrant wanting to rule a country, they first took away the citizens right to own arms and then the arms themselves.  Hitler was a staunch advocate of gun control in Germany, and before he started mass-murdering people he made sure none of the citizens had guns to defend themselves with.  Stalin did the same thing in Russia.  It probably also happened in numerous other places that I don’t even know of.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/the.html">@the</a> countries you mentioned, did any of those citizens have the right to own guns before the revolution?  I’m positive they didn’t as they were all ran by a dictator.  Certainly revolution is possible without guns, but you would have to be crazy to think it would not be much, much harder.</p>
<p>Obviously protecting freedoms is not the only reason for guns, hunting, self defense, and defense of your country from others are valid reasons as well.</p>

<p>My interpretation of the second amendment is that it’s there to ensure the sovereignty of the US. In other words, to prevent other nations from gaining control over the US. Today, that’s pretty much the point of having an army. Back in those days, the difference between a militia and an army were present, but small. The capabilities of a general was much more important. Nowadays, the military has tanks/helicopters/fighter jets/bombers/tactical missiles/artillery/etc, while the militia still only has (automatic) rifles and perhaps light artillery.</p>

<p>Mubarak didn’t decide to become a dictator a few days ago, he decided to become one 30 years ago. A pro-US dictator will receive aid no matter what, especially in the Middle-East.</p>
<p>You cannot deny the fact that the US supports dictators when the dictator rules a country of interest to the US. Look at Batista, the former dictator of Cuba:</p>
<blockquote>Fulgencio Batista murdered 20,000 Cubans in seven years ... and he turned Democratic Cuba into a complete police state - destroying every individual liberty. Yet our aid to his regime, and the ineptness of our policies, enabled Batista to invoke the name of the United States in support of his reign of terror. Administration spokesmen publicly praised Batista - hailed him as a staunch ally and a good friend - at a time when Batista was murdering thousands, destroying the last vestiges of freedom, and stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from the Cuban people, and we failed to press for free elections</blockquote>
<p>Guess who said that.</p>
<p>Next up: Operation Condor. A whopping 6 dictators were supported in their killing festivities by the US.</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<blockquote>The 1953 Iranian coup d'état, on August 19, 1953 (known as the 28 Mordad coup[1] in Iran), was the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh orchestrated by the intelligence agencies of the United Kingdom and the United States.[2] The coup launched 26 years of dictatorship under Mohammad-Rezā Shāh Pahlavi, who relied heavily on U.S. support to hold on to power until the Shah himself was overthrown in February 1979.</blockquote>
