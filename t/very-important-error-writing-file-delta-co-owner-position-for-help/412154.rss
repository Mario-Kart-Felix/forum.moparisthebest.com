    <title>Very Important, &#39;ERROR WRITING FILE&#39; [DELTA] CO-OWNER POSITION FOR HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/very-important-error-writing-file-delta-co-owner-position-for-help/412154</link>
    <description>I&#39;m running a DELTA server. I&#39;ve never had this problem until now.
 
Any person who logs on to my server it will not save their file. 

The command window says &#39;Error Writing File&#39;




When a new player logs on it says, &quot;Character File not found&quot; - Thats standard.

However, it&#39;s supposed to save the file but won&#39;t. It gives me &quot;Error Writing File&quot; 

When an Old Player logs on it will load them but will not save, it says, &quot;Error Writing File&quot; 

I&#39;ve never had this problem before and i&#39;ve been running my server for over 2 months.

Please help I am offering a Co-Owner position on my server for the answer to this problem.

Thank you,

              <p>Look to see if the directory for saving the character files is correct. You may be missing the Charaters folder. I don’t know much about Delta but it is common sense.</p>
