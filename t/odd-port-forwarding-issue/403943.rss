    <title>Odd port forwarding issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/odd-port-forwarding-issue/403943</link>
    <description>INFO:

Source: Blankscape
ISP: BT
Router: Huawei Echolife-HG532
________________________________________

OK I have a really strange port forwarding issue.

I have set up a no-ip host, forwarded ports 43594 through my router but I get the &quot;Error connecting to server&quot; issue when I try and log in to my private server.

I am trying to use the &#39;Blankscape&#39; source and I have hosted private servers on my computer before. The only thing I can think is that my ISP has suddenly started blocking these ports?

I have ran several website based port tests and they all claim port 43594 is closed, or there is no route to host. Except for utorrents port checker, which claims the port is open and working.

Could it be the source I am using, have my ISP suddenly closed the ports?
Or could there be another reason?

(I can&#39;t ring up my ISP as we are moving soon, to SKY)</description>
