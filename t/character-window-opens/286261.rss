    <title>Character Window Opens</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/character-window-opens/286261</link>
    <description>Ok i have basically got a blank source with not much things on for me to learn basic coding on

i know how to set a unique look in player.java

how ever people who come on my server might not want to look like that so i want to add a character window design screen as i have seen on other servers.

Ok i found out the interface id is 3559

i also know a code is : setInterfaceWalkable(3559);

i just dont know where to insert everything so it works.

If you dont know what i mean look at the picture below.

<p>Heres a ::char code if you need it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">} else if (command.startsWith("char")) {
            showInterface(3559);</code></pre>
<p>You can put this anywhere under any code, it would help if it was a command but if not then thats ok.</p>
<p>But I don’t really know how to do it when they log in, it would take a while to find it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
