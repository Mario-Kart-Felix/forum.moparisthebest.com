              <p>Also, stupid quite scripting long ago, I wouldn’t expect any answers. And thank you for removing the script, you didnt have to post the entire script, you should have just named the script and chances are people might now if there is a problem. Anyways, were not scammers so i doubt you’ll get the help you need with a scam-script.</p>

<p>First my friend purchased this script from Stupid3ooo. My friend told me the script doesn’t work, he does not want to sign up for any forums (Donno Why). Anyway, he gave me the script, to post it here, to ask for help. Why didn’t he email Stupid3ooo for reference? Stupid3ooo won’t answer his Email.</p>
