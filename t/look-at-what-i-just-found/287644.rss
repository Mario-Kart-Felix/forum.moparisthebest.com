    <title>Look at what I just found</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/look-at-what-i-just-found/287644</link>
    <description> Well, I have made well over 100 Runescape accounts since 2002. 

I stumbled across one of my old level 3&#39;s which I planned on making a pure. But I quit it because I decided I hated RS and I was never going to play. But I started back up again just for shits and giggles. This account is 5 years old.

It&#39;s a level 3... 

It has this along with 500k Bronze arrows and 192k Willow Logs which is roughly 4.5 mil.

So is that a good start to a F2P pure?</description>

              <p>Yeah, pretty good start. 4.5m is a decent amount of cash for f2pers. You already got the gear to pk too. You also have all the things you need to train, i’d advise getting cake or something though to save you a bit of cash instead of using Lobsters.</p>
