    <title>A very simple question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-very-simple-question/378846</link>
    <description>Basically, when a player gos onto a certain coordinate, I want something to happen. I would little to no lagg emitted from this process, though.

Please refer me to the function which can do this (if there is one), or help me by teaching me how to do it manually.

Also, If you can&#39;t figure it out, Another suggestion would be finding out when a player is standing on a certain object. I&#39;m sure that this would cause a little less lagg (rather then a constant timer checking if a player is on a coordinate [this made me lagg tonnes]).

Thank you guys very much in advance. (Just so you know, I&#39;m making a minigame :P).

Edit: I forgot to state that I&#39;m using a Project Insanity base (I&#39;m used to delta and czar; but I&#39;m finding PI much better, In almost every way).</description>

<p>Agreed but it’s still possible, if your some 1337 Coder xD. But he is right though, it’d still need to be a when you click on this, you end up doing this or that. Just like a simple portal to be honest. Just a little more complex.</p>
