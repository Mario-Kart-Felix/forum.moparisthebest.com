    <title>Having Webclient trouble Loader.class (NotFoundException)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/having-webclient-trouble-loader-class-notfoundexception/533964</link>
    <description>I pasted this HTML code on my website:
[code]&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;black&quot;&gt;
&lt;title&gt;LostRealm718 Webclient&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;applet name=client width=100% height=100% archive &#39;https://www.dropbox.com/s/sbla3iyw5kb532p/Client.jar&#39; code=&#39;Loader.class&#39;&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;[/code]

I seem to be having trouble with the Loader.class part because I get this error:
[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/303lp2v.jpg[/img]

So I tried to copy the Loader.class file from my client files into my C:/ drive and it still didn&#39;t fix it. I signed and Jar&#39;d my client properly and also have my archived cache and unarchived cache in my C:/ drive.

I have followed 3 tutorials on youtube and a few other guides on forums on here and nothing seems to fix this error.
I have uninstalled and reinstalled java, clean registry errors, reloaded cache.
I am not sure what is wrong can somebody please help me or teamview me?</description>
