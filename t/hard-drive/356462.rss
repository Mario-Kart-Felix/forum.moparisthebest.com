    <title>Hard Drive</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hard-drive/356462</link>
    <description>I have several boxes full of old computer components.  Today, I decided to try and take certain pieces and build a shitty ass computer.  Why the hell not right  :rolleyes: ?

The best motherboard I had in this box was an old Asus board that houses an Intel P3.  Pretty good board back in the day actually.

Anyways, I also had a couple hard drives to pick form and what not and settled on an old Sea Gate drive.

When the hard drive is connected to the power supply ONLY, it will spin up.  However, as soon as I also connect the hard drive to the mobo, it will not spin up.  Same story with any other drive I tried.

So I am left to believe it is probably a motherboard problem but I would like to post here in case anyone has any idea or suggestions.

Cheers guys.</description>

<p>[quote=“CoonHunter, post:3, topic:356462”]See about getting a test-light (or meter) and make sure there is sufficient (or even any) power going to the HDD from the motherboard. Also, make sure the wire’s/connections are good on what you are using to plug the HDD into the Mobo, those are the only issues I can think of atm, will post more later as I figure em out.[/quote]Yea I’ll meter it.  The cables are good though, I tested a few different ones.</p>
