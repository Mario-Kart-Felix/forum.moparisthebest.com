    <description>

Anyone else play this?

I&#39;m interested in a few things.

Here&#39;s some of my favorite things to do:

Sick ass gaps. I&#39;m looking for more of these! I&#39;ve been going around the city setting up custom Spots at each one I find so I can easily get back to them.
Cool sets of stairs. Same as above. Especially stairs with cool grinds.
Flip tricks. Mainly into grinds.

My favorite trick is the 360 Heelflip. And also the Laser Flip. 
Even better, I like manualling, reverting while in a manual so it stays in the manual and do one of those tricks right as it finishes. It looks sick.

I recently saw a tip on the load screen kind of saying something like that and how it&#39;s &quot;tech.&quot;

So I&#39;m looking for explanations on a few things.

Tech tricks. Tech skating. Etc. What is it and I want to do it more if I already like it.
Tried googling it but I get a lot of tech deck shit.

Half-Cabs. What are cabs.


Also. Any insane gaps, rails, stairs, anything that you think I&#39;d like.</description>

<p>Start comp, then quit. Go up the long tube place until you pass the yellow raised up parts with the dip in’s inbetween. right after that should be a fence laying down.</p>
<p>Bring it all the way down and right infront of the table you use as a ramp. Don’t let it touch the table though.</p>
<p>Then start the comp. For the first trick it should be normal, and after that they always fail.</p>

Only thing i don’t like about this is the moving of your character off board, it needs a bit more work</p>

<p>I agree with the walking. Especially the fact that both joysticks X directions rotate the player, so they counteract each other if you’re trying to look to the left but move to the right =/</p>
<p>But that is so true.<br>
I find myself sitting at the same place and marker for the whole time I’d play it in one day.</p>
<p>I’d see it, set a marker, and try it. Once I landed it, I’d have to go back and do it again trying out the perfect trick I had in mind until I land that.</p>
<p>You know those like five flat areas that drop down like twenty feet each time? There was a challenge there do a different trick over each one.</p>
<p>I spent an entire day trying to jump off the first one, triple heelflip 360, and land on the rail of the other one and grind that.</p>
<p>Almost impossible because the game “thinks” where you want to land and always pushes you to either side of the rail.</p>
<p>But I got it. INSANE.</p>

<p>I love skate 2, I just wish the walking didn’t suck ass. The great thing about the game is that it really is like boarding. Not the controls, but how you can just sit at a set and use it for hours. I spent a couple hours on only a 10 set,  jumping it over and over.<br>
Amazing game, online is pretty sick.</p>
