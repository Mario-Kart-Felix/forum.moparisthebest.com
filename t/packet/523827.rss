That is the error that keeps spamming every time I log in. I am using a PI 317 loading 600+ (desolationx). Can someone please tell me how to fix? I used google to see if someone had the same problem and people had different numbers as me and no solution. Also is it harmful to me if I hosted the server but having those errors? But my main concern is how do I fix these error that spam my client like crazy...</description>
