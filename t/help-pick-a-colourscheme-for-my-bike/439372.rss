    <description>Due to an accident, some of the stickers/decals on my bike got &quot;destroyed&quot; pretty bad and replacing them will cost more than buying paint and such for an air compressor(which we have), so I&#39;m going to paint the bike myself. 

only pic of the bike I have on hand: http://i.imgur.com/wyMZq.jpg

the bike model: yamaha dt 125 r 

I wanted to do something with the red and white original colour scheme(http://www.flickr.com/photos/45234635@N07/4162694319/) but as you can see from my pic, the frame is blue and it&#39;s quite a nice paint job so I&#39;d rather keep it (saves me having to strip the bike completely) and I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;d look

so, gents, any suggested colour scheme for the bike? the seat can be [url=http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=yamaha+dt+125+r+seat+cover&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_dmpt=UK_Motorcycle_Parts&amp;_odkw=yamaha+dt+125+r+seat&amp;_osacat=0]black/white/purple/blue/red/green[/url], ideally the scheme will have white and red, and ideally the frame can be kept blue</description>
