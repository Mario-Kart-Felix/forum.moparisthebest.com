    <description>So today, Google released a new search interface.
It seems that the home page buttons and logo&#39;s are more crisp, but what has really changed is hitting the &quot;search button&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a move to boost search result relevance, Google May 5 began rolling out several new search features to help users refine their search results. Users can now slice and dice search results by content type and receive more relevant search options from Google, which, along with rivals Microsoft Bing and Yahoo, is striving to make search smarter. These changes, which began rolling out May 5 across 37 languages, live in the left-hand panel. You might not be able to see them yet, so eWEEK offers a glimpse of them in this slide show.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Personally, I find it to be slower, and I don&#39;t like how I don&#39;t get as much &quot;direct links&quot; to a page.
