    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/leak-causing-bastardness/312019</link>
    <description>I share a car with my mum, and it&#39;s always had problems when ever we get a lot of rain. For example the engine sometimes doesn&#39;t start properly after its been raining, and when you press the gas it dry humps the road and stalls.

Few weeks ago the back seat had become very wet (I wish it was from sexual times A-har-har!, however it wasn&#39;t), I looked in the trunk and low and behold the matting was as wet as spongebob squarepants. I cleared out the matting. 

It&#39;s obvious that I have a leak however I can&#39;t for the life of me find it. 

It was raining heavily earlier today and I was about to get in, tried to open the doors, they wouldn&#39;t open. The central locking was fucked and wasn&#39;t unlatching the doors. 

So it&#39;s obvious that the car is letting in water somewhere, and obviously this water is fucking with the electrical systems. 

Sorry for long post but does anyone know how I can sort this out?</description>

<p>It can be so small you can’t see it but water vapor can still get through.  Our distributor caps here for most cars cost about $12, it may be a good idea just to replace it.</p>

              <p>dont use dye like that idiot said u dont want fuckin purple seats, however using a bucket of water u can find some leaks, i doubt its anything to do with the distributor cap, more likely to be shorting some wires (hence the central locking not working, and possibly fucking with the ignition resulting in a possible misfire?)</p>

              <p>If the locking system is acting weird and the back seats are wet, isn’t a leaky door an obvious cause? The water could be getting in anywhere but might not wet all the shit around it because the metal and rubber channeling could take the water lower down to soak into the seats.</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s the sunroof? It could be anything really… just try chucking water over it or something to try to see where it comes in.</p>
<p>I don’t really know much about cars, I’m just suggesting some ideas.</p>

You can check for yourself. If the bottom is all rusty, it’s almost a certainty that the plate is where it’s leaking from.<br>

I don’t know though, how would the water be going upwards? I understand when your driving water would be spraying up from the wheels but the problem only happen after it’s been left in the rain parked for a night. Hmm[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of cars that had a leaking bottom plate and with wet back seats and trunk. Maybe your car has a leak somewhere else though.</p>

              <p>In autotech class a guy had a similar leak where the spoiler was attached to the trunk.  We put this black silicon goo on the connection and it didn’t leak anymore.</p>
<p>check for those type of spots.</p>

              <p>I share a car with my mum, and it’s always had problems when ever we get a lot of rain. For example the engine sometimes doesn’t start properly after its been raining, and when you press the gas it dry humps the road and stalls.</p>
<p>Few weeks ago the back seat had become very wet (I wish it was from sexual times A-har-har!, however it wasn’t), I looked in the trunk and low and behold the matting was as wet as spongebob squarepants. I cleared out the matting.</p>
<p>It’s obvious that I have a leak however I can’t for the life of me find it.</p>
<p>It was raining heavily earlier today and I was about to get in, tried to open the doors, they wouldn’t open. The central locking was fucked and wasn’t unlatching the doors.</p>
<p>So it’s obvious that the car is letting in water somewhere, and obviously this water is fucking with the electrical systems.</p>
<p>Sorry for long post but does anyone know how I can sort this out?</p>
