    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-player-drop-something-everytime-they-die/356317</link>
    <description>I want to make it so every time a player dies there is a 100% chance that the player will drop a certain item. This item I want the player to drop is Tokul but it doesn&#39;t really matter I just want to know how to make a player drop something every time he dies. Any help is greatly appreciated
