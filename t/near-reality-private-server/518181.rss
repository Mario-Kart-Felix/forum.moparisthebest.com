    <description>i figured out the fucked up problem... and it was that i can&#39;t decompress an rsps client. as its too big and it dident do it properly and thefor it produced an error.

              <p>In that statement you have the == operator in use, just the wrong way. Take a look at your second part of your code, which is laid out as ‘= =’. What could you change to make that statement say ‘==’?<br>

In the future I recommend using an IDE to build your server, as it will point out mistakes such as this and tell you exactly how to fix them.</p>
