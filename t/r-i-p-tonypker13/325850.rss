    <title>R.I.P. Tonypker13</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/r-i-p-tonypker13/325850</link>
    <description>As some of you may or may not have known, our dear friend Tonypker13 has left us. He was hit by a bus, as soon as his friends called 911, the paramedics rushed him to the hospital, but a short while later, he died. As his sister Suzy describes, it took them several minutes to get there. (I&#39;m good friends with tony, so she texted me when it was going on) As she describes, he was skateboarding with his friends, they were skating by the bus stop. I&#39;d rather not explain it, it&#39;s tearing me up, it&#39;s terribly tragic what happened to this poor guy. Since I&#39;ve been a good friend with tony for a while, I think that it&#39;d be best if I posted this topic to let you guys know. 

R.I.P. Tony, may your soul rest my friend.</description>

<p>I stopped using it once I got banned lol… I got to 81 woodcutting with it and over 26k willows with it, but I guess it’s my fault for getting banned o.O but at least I wasn’t like those guys that use it on their main. I might get back into it. Have you made any scripts? And how were you learning java at 8? What did you do and use?<br>

<p>I’ve been WC botting for like 2 weeks, almost 92 atm.<br>
I make a LOTTT of scripts, my latest one was Shilo Village fisher.</p>
<p>I can explain the Java thing.<br>
My dad, worked at Dell as a programmer and he was an original producer in the Java project.<br>
He LOVED programming, and I wanted to try it out.<br>
So I did.</p>
<p>I almost stopped programming, but my dad died last July and I wanted to carry on his love for it, so I decided to =D<br>

<h2>You probably don’t want to talk about it so sorry for asking and sorry about your dad man :’( it’s gotta be tough…</h2>
<p>I didn’t really know him. This was the only time we really had a conversation. I dedicate this conversation to `Lewk_ to give him a little bit more of his close friend. To everyone in this topic who says he was a faggot or “who gives a shit”, then you may go to hell and burn. You don’t know him, at all, so at least show respect for the dead, or shut the fuck up and go elsewhere. You know what? This just goes to prove one thing. People in this community aren’t assholes and retarded fucks just because these are forums on the internet or because this is MoparScape and it just doesn’t matter, they’re assholes and retarded fucks because they really are assholes and retarded fucks. Put everything else MoparScape-related aside for a minute. This is a topic about reality, something 90% of you fail to see. You don’t go to funerals to spit in the coffin. You either go to respect them, or you just don’t go. If you’re that kind of person, then just shut the fuck up and hit the back button.</p>
<p>If a moderator possibly somehow just so happens to find something wrong with this post whatsoever for some reason at all, then go ahead and give me my infraction. All of the above is 100% real and true.</p>
<p>R.I.P. Tony (Not Tonypker13, that’s not his real name. It’s Tony now.)<br>
That is, if all of this is true and he really is dead.</p>
