    <title>Beta Testers</title>

    <description>Ok well I am looking for 1-3 beta testers to help me see if the client is connecting.

Three things you will need:
1) Hamachi
2) Client (471 kb)
3) Game File. (6.38 mb)

Comment to let me know you wish to be a beta tester.

Once you comment me I will send you the client and game file links and also my Hamachi network and network password. Then you will extract the client. [b]DO NOT EXTRACT THE GAME FILE[/b]!!! Next go into the client folder and run the client. You will then go to [b]OPTIONS[/b] and scroll to the [b]THIRD[/b] submenu under the options tab. Locate [b]SYNCHRONIZE[/b]. Make sure that it is [b]UNCHECKED[/b]. Then go back to the options tab and scroll to the very last submenu. Make sure that [b]WIRELESS ADAPTER[/b] is checked. Now that you have the wireless adapter set up press [b]ctrl+M[/b]. A menu should pop-up. In the [b]GENERAL[/b] of the new menu make sure the [b]NETWORK[/b] bullet is selected. Then go to the [b]CLIENT[/b] tab of the new menu and type in my hamachi address. Once all the players have connected go to [b]FILE[/b], [b]OPEN[/b], and locate the game files you downloaded. Once the game loads up be sure to click on multiplayer.

Thanks everybody!
