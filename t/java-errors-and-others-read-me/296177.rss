    <title>Java errors and others. [READ ME]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-errors-and-others-read-me/296177</link>
    <description>I would like to take time just to say a few things about the recent posts that I&#39;ve seen being made over the help section. So far today there has been over 30 topics asking about Java compiler issues, even though there is a tutorial in the &quot;Server Tutorials&quot; that helps with Java compiling errors.

I&#39;ve also seen some Java exception errors, please could you start using the search feature or click [url=http://google.com]here[/url]

Hopefully this will be the end of the over occurring question.</description>

              <p>Methinks they should create Help Subboards.<br>
A different board for every kind of problem.<br>
(There’s only about 7 types: Compiler, Text, Shops, NPCs, Money, Home/Death Spawn, Object Teleports.)<br>
Maybe a few more.</p>
<p>But that would take them about 5 minutes to make new categories, and delete 550k posts, and sort maybe 100 into the boards, with the effort of multiple admins.</p>

              <p>Thing about the search feature: It gives you many many many useless topics, even if you use additional options. People who search usually come here.  ;D</p>
