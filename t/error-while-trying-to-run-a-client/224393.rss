    <description>Running a .bat file to start server and having issues with java, help please 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, whenever I try to start a server, I run the .bat file, and when cmd pops up i get the following error
&quot;&quot;An error occurred during initiaztion of VM, could not reserve enough space for object heap
could not create the java virutal machine, press any key to continue&quot;&quot;

I have the latest java 6 update 10, my path and everything is set up. How do i fix this?</description>
