<p>So besides adding 3 faces all you did was recoloured it? FAIL. Prepare to get flamed, or not even flamed, becuase half the community is quitting because all everyone is doing is recolouring. Recolouring is easy,quick and simple and is not modeling what so ever. You won’t learn from this, try making them from scratch, or even tracing them.</p>
