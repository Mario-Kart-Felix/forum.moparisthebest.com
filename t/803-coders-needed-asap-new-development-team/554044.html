        <p>Hello MoparScape members and developers,<br>
I am looking for a development team that will help me fully create an RS3 Server.</p>
<p>Why an RS3 Server you say?</p>
<p>Well performing tasks and other stuff is very easy in RS3. The only thing that sucks about it is the Combat System on PvP. Combat system for PvM is very nice and easy to use, but when it comes to pking it is pure absolute crap.</p>
<p>Ok so enough talk, lets get down to business. I am gonna need a team of coders that will help me through this RS3 Development.</p>
<p>What all needs to be done:<br>
•Fully Working Combat System<br>
•Fully Working Player and NPC Clip System<br>
•Fully Working PKING System (See Below for Details of how it’s going to be done)<br>
•Fully Working Skills (ALL SKILLS)<br>
•Fully Working Dungeoneering with the option to form parties<br>
•Fully Working Shops<br>
•Fully Working Grand Exchange with no bugs<br>
•Fully Working NPC Facing Direction<br>
•Fully Working Emotes<br>
•Fully Working Public Chat/Clan Chat/Private Chat<br>
•Fully Working Clan Citadel<br>
•Fully Working Custom Quests<br>
•Fully Working Customs (Items/Equipment/Auras/Titles/Emotes/ECT…)<br>
•No Bugs / Dupes / ECT…<br>
•I COULD GO ON BUT LETS JUST DO THE SIMPLE TASKS FIRST</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking… You’re insane there’s no way in hell your gonna make a flawless RS3 Private Server. Well that’s the idea is to make it flawless so people enjoy it more, and don’t have to worry about the little things that screws them up in the end. With enough developers working on this as a team we can manage to do it, but only if you are able to co-operate with one another.</p>
<p>Are you worried that Jagex is going to come after you and sue your ass?<br>
Nah, not really because the client I am going to have, and all the models I am gonna have to edit are not gonna be the same as RuneScape 3 Client. Matter of fact let’s just say this, everything is for educational purposes and the client + server is not endorsed or affiliated by Jagex.</p>
<p>So what about this PKING System?<br>
The PKING System I want done for it is gonna be a complete shocker. Once you enter any PKING Area the client will switch from RS3 to Legacy Mode making it the best PKING out there since old school. That’s right. Screw RS3 Pking. We still like to fight each other fair not cheap lol.</p>
<p>Alright then what about Dungeoneering and the Clan Citadel? How you the hell are you gonna manage to add that?<br>
Well as of now I have no idea, not even a single clue. That’s why I’m asking for all the help I can, to make a really badass private server.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of helping you?<br>
Well, here’s the thing. Benefits are always enjoyable right? Well you can’t get benefits unless your actually gonna be dedicated with me to get this project on the go and out there.<br>
Benefits:<br>
• You will be credited for help making the server (Optional)<br>
• You will be apart of the development team for my website (Required - Duh)<br>
• If profit is made from this project it will be split between the development team and the website (WOAH MONEY!  :D)<br>
• You will be the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> development team across all RSPS community (I’m FAMOUS?!?!?! :eek:)<br>
• ++ MANY MORE TO COME ++</p>
<p>If you are 100% dedicated to doing this or have any questions then please contact me</p>
