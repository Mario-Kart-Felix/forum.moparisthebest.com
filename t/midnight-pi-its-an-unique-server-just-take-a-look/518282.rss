Note :My server; i alread uploaded an advertice b4, but that was a long time ago but it doesn&#39;t realy fit anymore. so i&#39;ll tell u what i added or updated.
&lt;blockquote&gt;- Base is trisidiaXv3 (used some things from this as well)
- Guides helped me as well.
- Apollo helped as well, to find correct places, ids, npc ids, coords ect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;- Penguin place (::pengu)
- Dungeoneering (made it my selfs, ea room gives exp afther finishing, and gives u dungeoneering points)
- Zombie minnigame (people think its the same as the releases but i actualy changed it fully, its not even close anymore to the main 1)
- the home has been changed pretty nicely, its in a dark place ect. Witch fits the name ofc.
- The Npc,(shop npc) have been changed to scary npc, like ghoasts, vampires ect.
- i changed some altars, because they look to mainstream for me.
- Closely all bosses added, and dragons ect
- working on a eliten dungeoneering quest zone. will be finished soon.
- Finished godwars (my own way, it doesn&#39;t look like the normal godwars, again to main stream for me)
- I made bosses drop keys, for a crystal box (been added in a lot servers)
- made an new chest, with black keys, only the strong bosses dropping these, and these gives u nice items like phats, vesta, torva ect.
- changed rock crabs places
- Afther finishing dungeoneering, u get an random item, can be from barrow&#39;s to corrupt vesta, dragon ect. like a lot of items
- Added emotes on some new skill capes, i made a cape, when u reach all the skills max, u can buy it (or receif it at home) and u get an emote on it, a nice 1
- Dungeoneering skillcape, has dungeoneering emote to
- Pest controle ect, working fine
- All the skills work, sometims the emote laggs, atm trieing to fix it.
- New added donator zone
- Made the fact donators, they get the items easier, but if ure not a donator ure able to wear all the items and get all the items as well.
- A little server, like closely no 1 loggs.
- fixed the total level, u can get to 2475 now (in total level)
- made a skelleton zone, this is like the real runescape, u teleport to a place with agressive monkey skelletons lvl 142, they hit 20s if u don&#39;t use protection for prayer, 1-2s if u do use it. would be smart to use it, they drop full skelleton, pretty slowly but yes they drop it
- Made costume claws, well more like, made the white claws and black claws able to use a special and hit u. (ofc dragon claws are still stronger)
- Made a donator store, fine its not realy a good thing for some people, but i made sure it would not unbalance the intire eco.
- I changed the pk store, since it don&#39;t like it if there are to much diff sets inside ect.
- I&#39;m trieing to make some nice unique items inside the server, atm its not realy that unique yet. but soon this server will have a lot of unique things.
- Summoning added ofc, its working.
- items added, well torva, dfs, ags,bgs,zgs,sgs, death cape, primal, ect. lets say closely all the items from moost servers, atm not planning to make more items ect for now. i think the items i have are good enough to start with.
- Skills: well all the skills are added, like well evrything except for construction, i made pk skill in that place, (pk skill added in some other servers i know.)
- An other fact; i like to code a lot ect, but i don&#39;t like it if people get on and start begging for mod or admin, or just say my server sucks because i don&#39;t directly give items or ranks. so if ure a begger for rank ect, please just stay away, or play it without begging.
- Main reason i made this, is for people to find a server who isn&#39;t copy pasted or just name changed, i like variation my selfs in server. So i make a lot of new things (ofc i keep the old 1s) it might have a lot of portals or things like that, but at least, there is a lot to do.
- i&#39;m also from belguim, so my main lang isn&#39;t english+ i have dyslexia, so i rather dun have comments on my english or mistakes&lt;/blockquote&gt;
