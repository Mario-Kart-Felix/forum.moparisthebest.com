    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-edditing-the-moparscape-client/41576</link>
    <description>So you want to learn how to edit the shops, npcs, autospawns, monster drops, etc. Well the you came to the right place. First off you need to download moparscape if hav&#39;nt already and WinRar if you dont have that then this is pointless. To download WinRar just go to www.download.com and search for WinRar and you can download it FREE. Now install that and your ready. Ok dont install mopar yet, but extract the fils into any loacation you want. Then open the folder and go into Hybridscape and then you&#39;ll see the shops, npcs, autospawns, monster drops, etc. files. Open those and then edit it to the way you like and then installit and run have fun! NOTE: if it doesnt show up after installing it then go into the folder you extracted and click on Run and i should work. 
                                                                                                                         Enjoy![br][size=1]Posted on: December 30, 2006, 12:04:27 PM[/size][hr]This can be locked</description>
