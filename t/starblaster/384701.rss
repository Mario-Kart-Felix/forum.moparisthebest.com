    <title>Starblaster</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starblaster/384701</link>
    <description>I was reminiscing the other day and I thought of the first time I had used SCAR and that led to me thinking about starblaster. I remembered that he left the scene without really leaving a word as to why. Well I searched around for him a little bit and I happened to come across a profile on a web development forum with his name.

I still wasn&#39;t sure if it was him though so I checked some of his posts and lo and behold I found a post in which he answered some questions about moparscape and the likes. So at that point I was pretty sure it was the right guy so I sent him a message telling him who I was and why I was contacting him and I asked him we he left so abruptly. I waited for 3 or 4 days and I actually got a response.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hey buddy,

How&#39;s it going? Nice to hear from an old school cheater 

There were a few reasons I decided to leave, but without going into all the drama (lets face it, interent drama is pretty childish, right?), there were two main reason:
I simply became too busy - Around the time I decided to leave, I had started Uni, was enjoying myself quite a lot, and picked up a lot of new responsibilities. Although I checked in once in a while, I just became out of touch with the whole scene over time.
Cheating on RuneScape became very Java based; All of the java bots started to boom, and even SCAR bought in Java to help combat the new cheat detection systems. I was simply not interested in Java at all.


That&#39;s pretty much it! I&#39;ve now got a great job as a Web Developer, and have little time for anything else. I barely have any time to browse this forum now, let alone help manage about 5 all at once!

I&#39;m pretty sure no one really minded me leaving anyways.

Good to hear from you, and nice to know you used my scripts. I really enjoyed making them back in the day 

Star&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not sure how much any of you care but I figured some of you might.</description>

I have definitely seen/heard of the name before reading this topic and the SRL forum topic today.<br>
Maybe I happened upon it somewhere else… although my visits to the SRL forums or ruler’s forums are few and far between.</p>

I simply became too busy - Around the time I decided to leave, I had started Uni, was enjoying myself quite a lot, and picked up a lot of new responsibilities. Although I checked in once in a while, I just became out of touch with the whole scene over time.<br>
Cheating on RuneScape became very Java based; All of the java bots started to boom, and even SCAR bought in Java to help combat the new cheat detection systems. I was simply not interested in Java at all.</p>
<p>That’s pretty much it! I’ve now got a great job as a Web Developer, and have little time for anything else. I barely have any time to browse this forum now, let alone help manage about 5 all at once!</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure no one really minded me leaving anyways.</p>
<p>Good to hear from you, and nice to know you used my scripts. I really enjoyed making them back in the day</p>
