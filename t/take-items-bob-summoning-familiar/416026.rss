    <title>Take items BoB (summoning familiar)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/take-items-bob-summoning-familiar/416026</link>
    <description>Noob question, I had it, deleted it on accident *forgot how to do it* and now after googling it, turned to mopar.  Not asking to be spoonfed, just can someone tell me/ help me when I click actionbutton: 66122 or button: 66122, it takes only food out of your familiar, not anything else, so when you click it, it would take out only the food item codes, if there were any other items in there other than item 385, 391, and 15272, it would say &quot;You have no food left in your familiar&quot;, or &quot;your familiar&#39;s food supply is empty&quot;</description>
