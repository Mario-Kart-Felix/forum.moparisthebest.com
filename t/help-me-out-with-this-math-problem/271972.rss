    <description>I don&#39;t get this one:

The profit margin is 2%. You are able to reduce your costs by 5. So your profit raises with 5. Let&#39;s get back to the start. Your net sales are X. How much does X have to increase, in order to raise your profit by 5? Keep the 2% profit margin in mind.

Thanks in advance!</description>

<p>No.</p>
<p>I might have written down the question in an unclear way. The question is: how much do you have to raise your net sales to increase your profit with 5.</p>

<p>No. The profit margin stays 2%. Lets say there are two moments. At moment 1 the net sales are X. At moment 2 the net sales are X+Y. The profit at moment 2 has increased with 5, compared to moment 1. So what is Y? How much have the net sales increased at moment 2, so that the profit is increased with 5?</p>
<p>So it can’t be 7, because you guys just take the 2% margin and add the rise of the profit to it. But that 2% stays 2%.</p>
