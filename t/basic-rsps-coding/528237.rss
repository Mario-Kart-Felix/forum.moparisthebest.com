    <title>Basic RSPS coding?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/basic-rsps-coding/528237</link>
    <description>Could someone give me a super basic thing or error in a RSPS code that needs to be fixed and you tell me the problem? I am trying to learn how to code but it&#39;s not all clicking together in my mind, when I try.</description>

however, is someone wants to learn java from rsps (i know i did) then it would be best if they worked with well written/documented/efficient code.</p>

that doesn't even relate to the question the person asked. 
<blockquote>many people have, are, and can learn by using rsps - given they aren't fully retarded and use documentation as well.</blockquote>
i didn't say that you can't learn anything from rsps, and you don't have the right to call anyone retarded either. if they are going to use documentation, they should just forget about the rsps and learn about java in a different manner.

Unfortunately, a lot of people started programming with rs2 emulation, which isn’t necessarily bad, but it is like trying to repair a car when you have no mechanical background.[/quote]<br>
how do you learn to do anything new? you are taught by someone else, or something else.</p>
<p>most programming e-books give long explanations of the operators/statements/methods/classes/etc.<br>
they also generally show you ‘working code’ so that you can study it, or attempt to replicate it later.</p>
<p>many people have, are, and can learn by using rsps - given they aren’t fully retarded and use documentation as well.</p>
<p>it’s not hard to look at code and understand what it’s doing.[/quote]<br>
yeh i can make gud servers and i dnt evn need to know wat the code is</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people started programming with rs2 emulation, which isn’t necessarily bad, but it is like trying to repair a car when you have no mechanical background.</p>

<p>how do you learn to do anything new? you are taught by someone else, or something else.</p>
<p>most programming e-books give long explanations of the operators/statements/methods/classes/etc.<br>
they also generally show you ‘working code’ so that you can study it, or attempt to replicate it later.</p>
<p>many people have, are, and can learn by using rsps - given they aren’t fully retarded and use documentation as well.</p>
<p>it’s not hard to look at code and understand what it’s doing.</p>

              <p>Could someone give me a super basic thing or error in a RSPS code that needs to be fixed and you tell me the problem? I am trying to learn how to code but it’s not all clicking together in my mind, when I try.</p>
