    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/insanityx-client-problem/438520</link>
    <description>I have tried to Jar &amp; Sign the insanityX Client but when i try to download the cache on my second laptop it doesn&#39;t auto-download.

When i Jar the client its only 550kb where as when i jar another client its around 3mb.

When im on my other laptop i just get &quot;error trying again in 5 seconds...&quot;

I have downloaded the Fixed InsanityX client so they when the client loads up it locates the cache from the C: drive &amp; not from C:\Users\...

How can i fix this problem?</description>
