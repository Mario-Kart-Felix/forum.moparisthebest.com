    <title>Beginner question on source and client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/beginner-question-on-source-and-client/546343</link>
    <description>So I am very new to rsps and clients confuse me. I have a source I want to run but not a client. I have other clients that I have downloaded for other sources but those do not work when I run the source I want to use. How do I find or edit a client to work with a particular source? I know how I worded the question may sound terrible and I am sorry if this question has been answered many times before. thank you.</description>
