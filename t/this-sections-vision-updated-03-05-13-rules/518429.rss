    <title>This section&#39;s vision [Updated 03/05/13] + RULES</title>

    <description>Many of the community will be familiar with the suggestions section, where in the past topics would go into immediate moderation for staff to comment and potentially make them public for further discussion. This board comes back with the same idea, but a few changes to how discussion is done. For a start, topics are no longer immediately moderated meaning they become public the instant they&#39;re posted. So don&#39;t post in this board if you want to hold a private discussion, as it&#39;ll just go public.

This board is for community input, and suggestions for potential changes to make the community better. To be clear, this board is not for ranting about staff actions, or staff at all but rather this board is for suggesting forum changes such as: a new theme, a chatbox and so on. Nominations are no longer accepted, as it is a public board. When posting a suggestion please try to be clear, and perhaps provide graphics or description of what you&#39;re talking about. 

If you derail a suggestions topic you will be punished harshly, this section is not for witty, non-constructive replies. I&#39;ve gone ahead and moved the old public topics into this board, so any discussion had in the past isn&#39;t lost.

UPDATE:

[quote=&quot;Tom&quot;]I&#39;ve noticed that a few members think this section is for witty responses, and showing how well they can trash other members ideas with arrogant and non-constructive responses. Let me tell you that this is unacceptable, and you will be punished and in worse cases your posting rights to this section will be revoked. This topic is to make it exceptionally clear so we have no excuses in the future, if you do it your punishment is final. 

Please try your best to be as mature and constructive as possible, as a rule of thumb avoid answers such as &quot;No.&quot; or &quot;LOL!!!!&quot; please make your post worth something to the suggestion, this isn&#39;t for general forum discussion.[/quote]</description>

It is great that there is a resolved section, however it seems like a lot of in-progress or in-discussion threads are stuck between plenty of denied suggestions. It would be nice if we could get a status update or decision on some of them on the actual thread so that they are bumped to the top of the section and stay relevant.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>A lot of those in-progress threads are dependent on a forum upgrade, so they’ll remain in-progress until that is done.[/quote]<br>
Ah, well thanks for the update <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
