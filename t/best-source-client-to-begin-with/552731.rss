    <title>Best Source &amp; Client to begin with?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-source-client-to-begin-with/552731</link>
    <description>[center]Hi. My internet is going away in a few days and I&#39;m trying to download everything I can.
I thought this would be a perfect time to finally start and finish an rsps project.

Here&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for:

[ul][li]A source/client that would be ideal for me to make my first project on.[/li]
[li]Any downloadable files that would help me; being to study or what not.[/li][/ul]


Any help is appreciated!
