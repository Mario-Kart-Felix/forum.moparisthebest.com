    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pretty-good-private-server-help/31639</link>
    <description>[b]Purpose:[/b] To start out your private server

[b]Difficulty:[/b] 2

Assumed Knowledge: Know how to copy and paste and stuff.

[b]Server Base:[/b] Testscape

[b]Classes Modified:[/b] Client.java, Npc drops.cfg, Shops.cfg,
Autospawn.cfg (mabye autospawn2.cfg if ur autospawn.cfg is full),
Item notepad, Item3 notepad, Npc.cfg, Player notepad, Server notepad, and Npc handler notepad


[b][u]Procedure[/u][/b]
[b]Step 1:[/b] 

We should start out wityh downloading java.heres the link:
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
Download the one that says JDK 5.0 Update 10
Ok now u need WinRar to extract things to folders.
heres the link:
http://www.rarlab.com/
download the english version =)

[b]Step 2:[/b]

Ok now you need to download Testscape.
When you download it extract it to a folder
you want to keep it in.
heres the link:
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=X9Y464J9

[b]Step 3:[/b]

Now we need to edit the Compiler and Runserver.
Put this in your Compiler:

[code][@echo off
COLOR 08
title YOURSERVERNAME Client
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_07\bin\javac&quot; -cp . *.java
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_07\bin\java&quot; server
pause[/code]If it dosen&#39;t work then keep changing the 07 between 05-10.
Ok now put this in your Runserver:

[code]@echo off
title bmxscape Server
java -Xmx1024m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-ga-bin.jar server[/code]Now if you want a Endserver just copy like your compiler or something and paste it.
edit it and put this in it: 

[code]tskill java /a[/code]
Then rename it Endserver.

[b]Step 4:[/b]

Now we can start with editing the Client.java.
Open it and search for

[code]sendmessage(&quot;welc[/code]You should see 
[code]		sendMessage(&quot;Welcome to Testscape!&quot;);[/code]
You can change all the information put onto there to whatever you want it to say when you log in.
If you want you can copy one and after the last press enter and paste it, then change it to
whatever you want it to say, to add a new one.

[b]Step 5:[/b]

Ok now you need to search for the in Client.java

[code]sendQuest(&quot;@dbl@welcome[/code]Then change all the information you want on there to be on your main help menu.

[b]Step 6:[/b]

Now search for this in Client.java

[code]to logout safely[/code]If nothing comes up log in really quick and see what it says above the logout button and search for it.
Now change what it says to what you want it to say.

[b]Step 7:[/b]

Now search for this in Client.java

[code]oh dear you[/code]You can change that to whatever you want if you want to but you have to change all of them.
There are like 6 or something. You have to search again and again till you replace all of them.
There are alot more things you can change like what it says when you say ::saveme but you can probaly
do thoughs by yourself.

[b]Step 8:[/b]

Ok now open you Autospawn.cfg
If it dosen&#39;t let you right click and click open with notepad.
You should see some npcs that are spawned in the game.
Look at the top you should see

[code]//------NpcID---CoordX--CoordY--Height--RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-DescrptionCoordX [/code]
and CoordY are where the Npc is spawned at.
Every Npc has a height of 0.
the RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2 are where you want it to walk.
The WalkType is the way you want it to walk.(like 1 is for like mans and stuff and 2 is for like dragons and stuff) Ok now exit out of Autospawn.cfg. If you run out of room in Autospawn.cfg you have to use Autospawn2.cfg.

[b]Step 9:[/b]

Open Item notepad and replace

That should fix alot of item glitches like guthans helm and dragon helm and stuff.

[b]Step 10:[/b]

Open up Item3 notepad.
You should see like

[code]import java.io.*;
public class Item3 {

public static int slayeritems85[] = {1079,1079,1091,1091,1091,1091,1089,1089,989,989,989,989,1113,7158,1149,1187,1093,1093,1113,1113,1113,1111,1111,1111,1147,1147,1147,1159,1159,1159,1161,1161,1161,1163,1163,1163,1183,1183,1183,1185,1185,1201};

    public static int randomSlayeritem85()
    {
    	return slayeritems85[(int)(Math.random()*slayeritems85.length)];
    }[/code]
The public static int is the item codes for the items that the monsters drop you can edit or make a new one.Heres a example:

[code]public static int Hobgoblin[] = {1038,1040,1042,1044,1046,1048,1050,1037,1053,1055,1057,1959,1961,962,3486,3481,3483,3488,4708,4710,4712,4714,4716,4718,4720,4722,4724,4726,4728,4730,4732,4734,4736,4738,4745,4747,4749,4751,4753,4755,4757,4759,4708,4710,4712,4714,4716,4718,4720,4722,4724,4726,4728,4730,4732,4734,4736,4738,4745,4747,4749,4751,4753,4755,4757,4759,4708,4710,4712,4714,4716,4718,4720,4722,4724,4726,4728,4730,4732,4734,4736,4738,4745,4747,4749,4751,4753,4755,4757,4759};
	public static int randomHobgoblin()
	{
		return Hobgoblin[(int)(Math.random()*Hobgoblin.length)];
	}
}[/code]
That makes the Hobgoblins drop stuff but before they do you have to open Npc handler notepad and search for

[code]int NPCID2 = NPCID+34;
//System.out.println(&quot;Npc id =&quot; +NPCID2);
//System.out.println(&quot;Npc id =&quot; +npcs[i].npcType);
//ItemHandler.addItem(newItemID, npcs[NPCID].absX, npcs[NPCID].absY, newItemAmount, GetNpcKiller(NPCID), false);
//if(NPCID2 == 200) // this is index number in autospawn cfg, not actual npc id, if using more than 1 of the desired npc use more than one index - cheez
//{[/code]Press enter after the last //{ thing and put in something example

[code]if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == 122)
{
ItemHandler.addItem(Item3.randomHobgoblin(), npcs[NPCID].absX, npcs[NPCID].absY, 1, GetNpcKiller(NPCID), false);
}[/code]
[b]Step 11:[/b]

Open Player.notepad and search for


[code]maxItemAmount = 2[/code]The number is the max amount of money you can have
you can change that to whatever you want except you cant go over 2147483647.

[b]Step 12:[/b]

Open Server notepad and search for

[code]MaxConnections[/code]
Then change the number to how many people you want on your server.

[b]Step 13[/b]:

Open up Shops.cfg, you can add more shops or edit shops if you want.
This is a example of a edited shop with is Horviks aurmor shop (you can replace you Horviks aurmor
shop with this one to add more items .  

[code]shop = 10	Horvik&#39;s_Armor_shop				2	2	1149	200	1187	200	3140	200	4087	200	4585	200	6570	200	6585	200	1052	200	3105	200	7158	200	1052	200	3204	200	4587	200	391	5000	4214	200	1305	200	5698	200	1434	200	6739	200	6737	200	6733	200	6731	200	6735	200	6107	200	2577	200	6524	200	6568	200	2581	200[/code]
If you want to add a shop add this at the bottom of your list


shop = #	Store_name_here[code]shop = #	Store_name_here				1	1	5555	1000Shop [/code]Shop = # has to be the number above the number below.
Name your store where it says Store_name_here.
Then you can add items.
Example of one of my shops.

[code]
shop = 49	@gre@holiday&#39;s_bargains				1	1	1419	2	1959	2	1961	2	981	2	6619	10	6617	10	6633	10	6623	10	6625	10	6611	10	1053	2	1057	2	1055	2	1050	2	1048	2	1046	2	1044	2	1042	2	1040	2	1038	2	4566	2	962	2	1037	2[/code]The @gre@ will make the righting green.
open autospawn and say if you want your npc to be a ghost shopkeeper copy all the hole thing on the ghostshopkeeper at the top and paste it right below the first varrock general store shopkeeper.
IT WILL NOT WORK IF IT ISNT PASTED BELOW VARROCK GENERAL STORE SHOP KEEPER!!
Open Client.java and search for


[code]else if (NPCID == 553) { //Aubury rune shop[/code]then press enter after the last of his shop and paste this

[code]
				} else if (NPCID == npc&#39;s id) { //name of shop
					PutNPCCoords = true;
					WanneShop = #; //name of shopkeeper[/code]
Where is says 
[code]NPCID == npc&#39;s id[/code]change change npc&#39;s id to the id of the shopkeeper.
where it says 
 [code]name of shop[/code]put the name of the shop. Replace the # in 


[code]WanneShop = #;to the number you assigned the shop to in Shop.cfg. Finally change name of shopkeeper to the name of the shopkeeper.[/code]

Ok thats all for now but for alot of tutorials go to this:

<p>We should start out wityh downloading java.heres the link:<br>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a><br>
Download the one that says JDK 5.0 Update 10<br>
Ok now u need WinRar to extract things to folders.<br>
heres the link:<br>
<a href="http://www.rarlab.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rarlab.com/</a><br>
download the english version =)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2:</span></p>
<p>Ok now you need to download Testscape.<br>
When you download it extract it to a folder<br>
you want to keep it in.<br>
heres the link:<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3:</span></p>
<p>Now we need to edit the Compiler and Runserver.<br>
Put this in your Compiler:</p>
<p><code>[@echo off
COLOR 08
title YOURSERVERNAME Client
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_07\bin\javac" -cp . *.java
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_07\bin\java" server
pause</code>If it dosen’t work then keep changing the 07 between 05-10.<br>
Ok now put this in your Runserver:</p>
<p><code>@echo off
title bmxscape Server
java -Xmx1024m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-ga-bin.jar server</code>Now if you want a Endserver just copy like your compiler or something and paste it.<br>
edit it and put this in it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">tskill java /a</code></pre>
<p>Then rename it Endserver.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 4:</span></p>
<p>Now we can start with editing the Client.java.<br>
Open it and search for</p>
<p><code>sendmessage("welc</code>You should see</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		sendMessage("Welcome to Testscape!");</code></pre>
<p>You can change all the information put onto there to whatever you want it to say when you log in.<br>
If you want you can copy one and after the last press enter and paste it, then change it to<br>
whatever you want it to say, to add a new one.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 5:</span></p>
<p>Ok now you need to search for the in Client.java</p>
<p><code>sendQuest("@dbl@welcome</code>Then change all the information you want on there to be on your main help menu.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 6:</span></p>
<p>Now search for this in Client.java</p>
<p><code>to logout safely</code>If nothing comes up log in really quick and see what it says above the logout button and search for it.<br>
Now change what it says to what you want it to say.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 7:</span></p>
<p>Now search for this in Client.java</p>
<p><code>oh dear you</code>You can change that to whatever you want if you want to but you have to change all of them.<br>
There are like 6 or something. You have to search again and again till you replace all of them.<br>
There are alot more things you can change like what it says when you say ::saveme but you can probaly<br>
do thoughs by yourself.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 8:</span></p>
<p>Ok now open you Autospawn.cfg<br>
If it dosen’t let you right click and click open with notepad.<br>
You should see some npcs that are spawned in the game.<br>
Look at the top you should see</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">//------NpcID---CoordX--CoordY--Height--RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-DescrptionCoordX </code></pre>
<p>and CoordY are where the Npc is spawned at.<br>
Every Npc has a height of 0.<br>
the RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2 are where you want it to walk.<br>
The WalkType is the way you want it to walk.(like 1 is for like mans and stuff and 2 is for like dragons and stuff) Ok now exit out of Autospawn.cfg. If you run out of room in Autospawn.cfg you have to use Autospawn2.cfg.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 9:</span></p>
<p>Open Item notepad and replace</p>

That should fix alot of item glitches like guthans helm and dragon helm and stuff.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 10:</span></p>
<p>Open up Item3 notepad.<br>
You should see like</p>
<p>[code]import <a href="http://java.io" rel="nofollow noopener">java.io</a>.*;<br>
public class Item3 {</p>
<p>public static int slayeritems85[] = {1079,1079,1091,1091,1091,1091,1089,1089,989,989,989,989,1113,7158,1149,1187,1093,1093,1113,1113,1113,1111,1111,1111,1147,1147,1147,1159,1159,1159,1161,1161,1161,1163,1163,1163,1183,1183,1183,1185,1185,1201};</p>
<pre><code>public static int randomSlayeritem85()
{
	return slayeritems85[(int)(Math.random()*slayeritems85.length)];
}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>The public static int is the item codes for the items that the monsters drop you can edit or make a new one.Heres a example:</p>
<p><code>public static int Hobgoblin[] = {1038,1040,1042,1044,1046,1048,1050,1037,1053,1055,1057,1959,1961,962,3486,3481,3483,3488,4708,4710,4712,4714,4716,4718,4720,4722,4724,4726,4728,4730,4732,4734,4736,4738,4745,4747,4749,4751,4753,4755,4757,4759,4708,4710,4712,4714,4716,4718,4720,4722,4724,4726,4728,4730,4732,4734,4736,4738,4745,4747,4749,4751,4753,4755,4757,4759,4708,4710,4712,4714,4716,4718,4720,4722,4724,4726,4728,4730,4732,4734,4736,4738,4745,4747,4749,4751,4753,4755,4757,4759};
	public static int randomHobgoblin()
	{
		return Hobgoblin[(int)(Math.random()*Hobgoblin.length)];
	}
}</code><br>
That makes the Hobgoblins drop stuff but before they do you have to open Npc handler notepad and search for</p>
<p><code>int NPCID2 = NPCID+34;
//System.out.println("Npc id =" +NPCID2);
//System.out.println("Npc id =" +npcs[i].npcType);
//ItemHandler.addItem(newItemID, npcs[NPCID].absX, npcs[NPCID].absY, newItemAmount, GetNpcKiller(NPCID), false);
//if(NPCID2 == 200) // this is index number in autospawn cfg, not actual npc id, if using more than 1 of the desired npc use more than one index - cheez
//{</code>Press enter after the last //{ thing and put in something example</p>
<p><code>if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == 122)
{
ItemHandler.addItem(Item3.randomHobgoblin(), npcs[NPCID].absX, npcs[NPCID].absY, 1, GetNpcKiller(NPCID), false);
}</code><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Step 11:</span></p>
<p>Open Player.notepad and search for</p>
<p><code>maxItemAmount = 2</code>The number is the max amount of money you can have<br>
you can change that to whatever you want except you cant go over 2147483647.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 12:</span></p>
<p>Open Server notepad and search for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">MaxConnections</code></pre>
<p>Then change the number to how many people you want on your server.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 13</span>:</p>
<p>Open up Shops.cfg, you can add more shops or edit shops if you want.<br>
This is a example of a edited shop with is Horviks aurmor shop (you can replace you Horviks aurmor<br>
shop with this one to add more items .</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = 10	Horvik's_Armor_shop				2	2	1149	200	1187	200	3140	200	4087	200	4585	200	6570	200	6585	200	1052	200	3105	200	7158	200	1052	200	3204	200	4587	200	391	5000	4214	200	1305	200	5698	200	1434	200	6739	200	6737	200	6733	200	6731	200	6735	200	6107	200	2577	200	6524	200	6568	200	2581	200</code></pre>
<p>If you want to add a shop add this at the bottom of your list</p>
<p>shop = #	Store_name_here<code>shop = #	Store_name_here				1	1	5555	1000Shop </code>Shop = # has to be the number above the number below.<br>
Name your store where it says Store_name_here.<br>
Then you can add items.<br>
Example of one of my shops.</p>
<p><code>
shop = 49	@gre@holiday's_bargains				1	1	1419	2	1959	2	1961	2	981	2	6619	10	6617	10	6633	10	6623	10	6625	10	6611	10	1053	2	1057	2	1055	2	1050	2	1048	2	1046	2	1044	2	1042	2	1040	2	1038	2	4566	2	962	2	1037	2</code>The <span class="mention">@gre</span>@ will make the righting green.<br>
open autospawn and say if you want your npc to be a ghost shopkeeper copy all the hole thing on the ghostshopkeeper at the top and paste it right below the first varrock general store shopkeeper.<br>
IT WILL NOT WORK IF IT ISNT PASTED BELOW VARROCK GENERAL STORE SHOP KEEPER!!<br>
Open Client.java and search for</p>
<p><code>else if (NPCID == 553) { //Aubury rune shop</code>then press enter after the last of his shop and paste this</p>
<p><code>
				} else if (NPCID == npc's id) { //name of shop
					PutNPCCoords = true;
					WanneShop = #; //name of shopkeeper</code><br>
Where is says</p>
<p><code>NPCID == npc's id</code>change change npc’s id to the id of the shopkeeper.<br>
where it says</p>
<p><code>name of shop</code>put the name of the shop. Replace the # in</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">WanneShop = #;to the number you assigned the shop to in Shop.cfg. Finally change name of shopkeeper to the name of the shopkeeper.</code></pre>
