    <description>I&#39;m attempting to make a minigame, a very simple one.  It&#39;s just you kill a monster and your points go up, u can buy stuff with the points, simple as that.  There is one problem i added this into my NPCHandler.java
[CODE] else if (npcs[i].npcType == 1629) {
							npcs[i].animNumber = 92;
							client.playerPoints += 1; //arctic dragon
						} [/CODE]
except it&#39;s adding a point for everyone!  I kill one everyone gets point.  How can i make it so only the person that kills it gets the point.</description>

              <p>umm… ok how?  and i already have all this added in client.java i made it add a line to your char file called playerpoints but it said it couldn’t find it so then i had to put public int playerpoint = 0; at the top then it said static variable can’t be applied to non-static so i made it public static int playerpoints = 0; and compiled fine but now adds points for everyone.</p>

              <p>Thats a static reference. You should know what static means, but since you obviously don’t it means that the field is the same for every instance of that class, and you don’t even need an instance to access that field. You would have to make the playerPoints field non-static and then reference the client object that killed the Npc.</p>
