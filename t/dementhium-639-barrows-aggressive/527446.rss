    <title>Dementhium 639 - Barrows aggressive</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dementhium-639-barrows-aggressive/527446</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to make a shitty barrows thing like most sevrers (lol) where the barrows brothers are just on top of the hills, and you just kill dem for loot.

Problem is, torags and dharoks are always aggressive and walktowards you, so you will see a mob of 20 brothers following you everywhere.
 
I have made sure that they are supposed to be unnagressive, and I have looked through almost every class but can&#39;t seem to find the line where its telling them to be aggressive and walk towards me and attack me.

Any help?</description>
