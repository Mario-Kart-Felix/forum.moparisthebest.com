    <description>Hey guys, so I am trying to dump some Item Files from my another server&#39;s cache and I cannot find an index1 or any folder that would contain the Item models, I went into the Cache Suite I have and tried finding them that way but I&#39;m not sure where to look for them. Any ideas on where I can find the item models in this cache?</description>
