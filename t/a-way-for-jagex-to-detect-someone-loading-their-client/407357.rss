<p>In case this is still relevant, this question was answered by the engine team. mdog311 posted about it in a thread here: <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,474600.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,474600.0.html</a></p>
<blockquote>Q. Why RS is a browser applet, instead of using Java Web Start? 
<p>A. Web start didn’t exist when RuneScape was created. I can’t really see any benefits to switching to it now that we’re established as an applet.<br>

In an attempt to put this thread back on track, does anyone here have any other reasonable suggested methods for avoiding detection? As I recall, semaphore, you found this “covering-your-ass” topic fairly important.</p>

I don’t know a bunch on the subject but if I had to hazard a guess I’d say its because they don’t want to make every user install another library (afaik its not part of the standard JRE), or because they want to have a simpler way to change them quickly or have them randomly generated as the game is processed (a system much easier with their current “parameters”).</p>
<p>Plus Jagex seems to be a little obsessed with using their own code and libraries.</p>

Couldn’t Jagex create a launcher that is not Java and use it to check client files before launch? And someone make the server HAVE to verify that you in fact ran and launched the game from the launcher?<br>
[/quote]<br>
If they want to have the game run in a web browser, they’re stuck with Java AFAIK. If they want to use a non-Java language, they’d have to make a desktop application in C++ or something. First of all, if that happens the browser option will still be available and we cheaters will continue to use it. Second of all, even then you could still decompile the native launcher to assembly and fuck shit up. It’d only bit a tad bit harder since assembly is a bitch.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah because Flash isn’t the most popular tool for web-game development…</p>

Again, you can worry about all that stuff, OR you can run the client in unsigned mode and worry about nothing.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes, but what causes unsigned to be slow as hell compared to signed other than redownloading the cache?[/quote]<br>
It appears you don’t understand the main_file_cache.</p>
<p>First you must understand the main difference between the signed and unsigned clients; i.e. the signed client uses a “loader” which runs trusted, and has various abilities to load native libraries, open sockets, read/write from disk, etc.<br>
The signlink class provides a service to execute actions like the above. If you look you’ll see the signlink in the client archive and the one in the loader archive differ a fair bit. The method providesignlink() is called from the loader to inject it’s privileged signlink to replace the client’s dummy, non-privileged default one.</p>
<p>So what does the unsigned client do, which is run without the loader stub? It runs limited.<br>
For example, it can only use the Java “safe-mode” software graphics engine, while signed code can run using native hw3d hardware engines, like jaggl for OpenGL and jagdx for DirectX, as well as their native sw3d software graphics engine.<br>
Another draw-back as you mentioned is the inability to do disk I/O, meaning it can not utilize the main_file_cache which acts as a local repository for cached resources. When running unsigned the client must submit on-demand requests to the update server far more frequently, which can easily slow the whole process down.</p>

</aside>
<p>But what exactly can the server do to <em>fool-proof</em> verify that all the checks passed? Anything that relies on the client can be falsified and spoofed; that is, the server doesn’t trust the client, the client trusts the server. This is a pretty simple and universal rule for virtually /anything/ modeled in the canonical client-server fashion.</p>

              <p>There are plenty of ways they can but also plenty of ways to subvert these methods.</p>
<p>Over-all, I’d <em>think</em> the safest you can guarantee yourself is using a stub JVM agent that loads your bot in a separate class loader from the clients, and having your stub use randomly generated names of some sort to prevent easy detection along the lines of</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (Class.forName("atlas.stub.Bootstrap") != null) {
    report();
}</code></pre>
<p>This is only necessary because -javaagent code is loaded into the same “domain” as the client’s code… or am I wrong, and does the JVM use a separate class loader for agents?</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
A good read… <a href="http://www.securingjava.com/chapter-two/chapter-two-7.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.securingjava.com/chapter-two/chapter-two-7.html</a></p>
<p>If I’m correct frank_ has attempted to bring this up several times now, but I don’t think anyone paid attention.<br>
Logically I’d think agent code is loaded in a class loader separate from the plugin’s applet class loader with a common parent at some point, so I don’t think there is any point in randomizing stub code names. Sorry <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>EDIT2:</p>
<blockquote>The agent class will be loaded by the system class loader (see ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader). This is the class loader which typically loads the class containing the application main method. The premain methods will be run under the same security and classloader rules as the application main method. There are no modeling restrictions on what the agent premain method may do. Anything application main can do, including creating threads, is legal from premain.</blockquote>
As it turns out frank_ was right. Since the system class loader is responsible for agent code, any of its children (indirectly including the applet class loader) can query its loaded classes... so random names it is.
