    <title>My Client.java Disappeared!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-client-java-disappeared/410965</link>
    <description>So, I was editing it as I got an error on my Compiler.
I did CTRL+S and then I closed it, I got an error again and so i tried to go into Client.java again but it wasn&#39;t there.
It isn&#39;t in my recycle bin...
I don&#39;t know where it went, I have a backup but I had loads of extra things there.</description>
