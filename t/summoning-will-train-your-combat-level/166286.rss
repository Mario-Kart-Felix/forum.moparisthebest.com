    <title>Summoning will train your combat level</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/summoning-will-train-your-combat-level/166286</link>
    <description>Well since no one else posted it i thought i might:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Summoning familiars are there to support you, whichever combat class your character is using, so we decided it made sense for them to add to your Combat level in a similar way to how Prayer does. Adding Summoning to the Combat level calculation means that the maximum will increase from 126 up to 138. It&#39;s a new goal for anyone who already has a level 126 character, or just for anyone who enjoys training skills.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Deciding that Summoning would add to a character&#39;s Combat level was quite easy, but there were repercussions for the rest of the game. Does this new Combat level affect Slayer assignments? What will this mean for Bounty Hunter, Clan Wars and the Duel Arena? How will future player-vs-player content be affected? How is Summoning balanced with combat? As you can imagine, balancing Summoning against all these factors is difficult. Some of the things it has led to include are &#39;No Summoning&#39; duels, a Protect from Summoning prayer and the relative cost of the skill.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
