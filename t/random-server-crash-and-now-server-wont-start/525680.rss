    <title>Random server crash and now server won&#39;t start</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/random-server-crash-and-now-server-wont-start/525680</link>
    <description>This is a 317 PI, I got the source from Acheron, or at least that&#39;s what it&#39;s called. But anyways I was just sitting there and I think I clicked something and it may have caused it to crash, but either way it crashed, and I tried starting it back up but all it does is the cmd prompt just opens and closes rapidly and it&#39;s saying a lot about not being able to resolve types. help would be much appreciated!</description>
