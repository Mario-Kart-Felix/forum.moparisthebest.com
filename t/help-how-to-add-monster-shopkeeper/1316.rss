<p>Well if you see the drops.cfg the first number in there is the npcID the second I believe is the rarity of the item to be dropped which you should look up because I don’t remember how rare each number represent I’m going to be re-writing the drops anyways lmao… anyways… as for adding fightable you go into the autospawn.cfg and add the npcID its coords… the range it can walk within… the wlak type set to 2 other wise they usually don’t walk … and then open the npc.cfg and find the ID of the monster and then theres a 3rd integer which is its HP change that from a 0 to the HP you wish it to have…  and as for a npc that sells items do the same as above by adding it to autospawn, no need to edit its hp… but then go into the shops.cfg… find the last number… add the next number “Shop ID” not npcID, then you see it will have words like Horvics_Armour_Shop, well basically type the name you want the shop to have but use the underscores instead of spaces… now the first number is itemID second is amount of the item, then 3rd is itemID, 4th is amount… etc etc etc and so on… then go into your client.java search for “wanneshop =” after you see the first instance scroll to the last instance of wanneshop should be like wanneshop = 32; ore somehting close… Now see that whole thing Like if NPCID == NUMBERHERE copy and paste a new one right under the last one you see… and just edit the numbers… edit the npcid to be the npc which you lcik trade on to open the shop… then for the wanneshop change it to the shop ID you put into the shops.cfg… That should be about it… sorry this isn’t to eplanitory I was typing it in like 3 mins from memory not even looking at the files but I know the majority if not all of this is right… also I forgot to mention some NPCs will disconnect when you trade them no matter what… jsut try a new NPC as the shop owner.</p>

              <p>1 and 2 basically means “buy” if the number is 1 it will buy and sell everything which it stocks and any other items unless it can’t be sold like gold and such. Now for 2 though 2 means it will only buy/sell what it has in stock forinstance if you make a Party hat shop with only partyhats in stock and set it to 2 on both then try to sell lets say a santa hat to the store it will tell you the store won’t buy it.</p>

              <p>Well if you see the drops.cfg the first number in there is the npcID the second I believe is the rarity of the item to be dropped which you should look up because I don’t remember how rare each number represent I’m going to be re-writing the drops anyways lmao… anyways… as for adding fightable you go into the autospawn.cfg and add the npcID its coords… the range it can walk within… the wlak type set to 2 other wise they usually don’t walk … and then open the npc.cfg and find the ID of the monster and then theres a 3rd integer which is its HP change that from a 0 to the HP you wish it to have…  and as for a npc that sells items do the same as above by adding it to autospawn, no need to edit its hp… but then go into the shops.cfg… find the last number… add the next number “Shop ID” not npcID, then you see it will have words like Horvics_Armour_Shop, well basically type the name you want the shop to have but use the underscores instead of spaces… now the first number is itemID second is amount of the item, then 3rd is itemID, 4th is amount… etc etc etc and so on… then go into your client.java search for “wanneshop =” after you see the first instance scroll to the last instance of wanneshop should be like wanneshop = 32; ore somehting close… Now see that whole thing Like if NPCID == NUMBERHERE copy and paste a new one right under the last one you see… and just edit the numbers… edit the npcid to be the npc which you lcik trade on to open the shop… then for the wanneshop change it to the shop ID you put into the shops.cfg… That should be about it… sorry this isn’t to eplanitory I was typing it in like 3 mins from memory not even looking at the files but I know the majority if not all of this is right… also I forgot to mention some NPCs will disconnect when you trade them no matter what… jsut try a new NPC as the shop owner.</p>
