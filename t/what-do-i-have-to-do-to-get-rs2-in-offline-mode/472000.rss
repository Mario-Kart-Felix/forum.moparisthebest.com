    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-i-have-to-do-to-get-rs2-in-offline-mode/472000</link>
    <description>the latest versdion of runescape before EoC is now unavalable. I was hopeing someone would be able to tell me what was involved with getting this client to run on my computer without internet or a jagex server. 

Am I wrong in thinking I have to edit a .jar file&#39;s IP&#39;s?</description>
