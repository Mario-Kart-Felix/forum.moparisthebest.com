    <description>This was posted on MITB, but Moparcraft desevres its own topic for viral videos! I also know I&#39;m late I watched the video in the past but never thought to make a topic here. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl1ujzRidmU

As soon as I watched this video my mind went &quot;This is Moparisthebest, and Hannah is his daughter in 15 or so years.&quot;

What do you guys think about it then, do you think he was right to do such a drastic action?</description>

              <p>Did anyone even watch his response to Dr. Phill?  He said he wasn’t proud of what he had done, but it’s to late now.  He went viral, and there’s nothing he can really do to stop it.  He never really ruined his daughter’s life, it would be the mass amount of overreacting people spreading it around that would’ve ruined it if anyone.  People act like parents should be perfect at parenting, when really, it’s a learning curve for both the parents and the child.</p>
<p>I do think that teens should be aloud to express their opinion on the way their parents are parenting, but at the same time, they shouldn’t have the say in the way they do their jobs.  I get sick of people saying “Wow you said one bad thing about your parent, you need to be punished”.  I don’t think parent’s should get super special treatment just because they’re your parents.</p>
<p>I believe you need to respect them considering all that they give you, but you shouldn’t be forced into agreeing with all their morals and beliefs, like many think.</p>

<p>If they were going to do any sort of harm to this girl, they would have already started imo. I realize that people were asking for dox but still no REAL harm has been done yet. you think the people over the internet haven’t forgotten about this? This topic was dead for weeks until you brought it back to our attention.</p>
<p>…and besides, it was initially jessi’s AND her parents fault that her life was ruined. so i guess this story goes the same way?</p>

<p>I felt the same way as a younger teen. cutting the grass and cleaning house. my dad would always tell me “this is my house”, so when it came to chores i would be like “but this is YOUR house”. and then bitch for hours until someone else did it and i got grounded lol</p>

look at the statistics of fatherless/motherless homes. A child needs both a mother and a father to get true adequate parenting, and a lot of children don't get it. whether it be because the father left the home, parent doesn't care, ect. Atleast he is standing his ground and parenting.

The teenager was in the wrong for posting, and the father was wrong for posting the video, however i will accept his punishment as its just a laptop? and he is the father. now it not usefull to argue with me for this simply fact as we all grew up from diff places and were raised differently</p>

<p>What we define as parenting comes from our own life experiences, we all don’t grow up and then reach the conclusion that one thing exactly is good parenting. Anything is parenting, but defining whether it was good parenting is another point.</p>
<p>People don’t just grow up and then know how to be a good parent, hell, there probably isn’t even a solid definition of good parenting. Everything in this world depends on belief progression and personal experience, which can be effected by age but not completely.</p>
<p>Where do you draw your especially in America point from again?</p>

And the people that wont forget it are usually the every day bully she was already dealing with.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So your real argument is “It’ll only worsen her life for all her teenage years!”. I guess that makes it okay then. The most influential years of a females life when a lot of her personality will be put into action, and she becomes vulnerable ad unstable as she adapts to a new way of life due to growth and so forth.</p>
<p>On top of that she now has this to deal with this, an increase in bullying, low self esteem and confidence problems. Let us explore each point:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Increase bullying - Over 5.7 million teens in the USA experience bullying, now I’m going to speak from some field experience here, when I was younger I was attacked for things that weren’t really my fault (verbally) they had a field day at times about it. If something like this happened to me, I don’t know what I’d do.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>My parents, the ones who were supposed to <span class="bbcode-b">stop</span> the bullying and support me, are the ones actually fueling the fire. Now, I understand it would be my fault but I’d expect a little better from my parents, I’d expect them to respond to the situation in a more adult way than I did. The parents responding the same way she acted didn’t teach her anything, it’s treating her like a dog.</p>
<p>Let us look at extreme cases as well, if things went really bad, this could even stretch as far as suicide. The thing is, none of us know the extent of her personal issues or any background issues. You may say there is a small chance of this ever happening, but would you risk your childs demise anyway?</p>
<p>Example of what bullying can cause: <a href="http://www.care2.com/causes/10-year-old-girl-commits-suicide-after-intense-bullying.html">http://www.care2.com/causes/10-year-old-girl-commits-suicide-after-intense-bullying.html</a></p>
<p>Now in this point I speak from experience, as above, the damage I’ve had done to my confidence in earlier life still hasn’t gone away and that was more than 6 years ago. I don’t think people understand how much of a bad experience the dent gives you for a huge part of your life.</p>
<p>It restricts what you’re able to do as a person, and halts personal progress. Most people think you just wake up one morning and it’s gone. Well, it aint that simple. So I think you’ll find serious harm is done in the end.</p>
<p>If you loved your child, you would not wish to put them through what would be caused by his actions. The idea of putting them through it for the greater benefit of themselves is silly, there are other ways to go about such a situation which achieve the same end effect.</p>

<p>She never stated (in the letter he read off) that there was any type of abuse. so on that subject, there is no “his words against hers”. My point about abuse (physical or mental) was that if it wasn’t abuse then it should be concealed in the child’s home and not posted for public reviews.</p>

              <p>Anyhow, such a response from her parents isn’t acceptable. Consider the social ramifications of what he has done, and how that will damage her mentally. She has been humiliated in front of every person she knew, and internet strangers, that is in no way acceptable what so ever. She will lack confidence for a large portion of her life, it is one thing making an example out of her in private but publicly doing it (in front of what turned out to be millions of people, with people then leaking private information about her).</p>
<p>As I’ve said earlier on in this thread none of us are aware of the methods that her father used in order to obtain the information about what she posted on Facebook so further arguing on such a point would be silly.</p>
<p>It’s not about what he could have done, he has humiliated his daughter completely, it isn’t a good parenting technique it’s bullying to say the least. Also, about the chores point, I’m going to play the Devils Advocate here. You do realize that it boils down to his word against hers, this situation can easily be turned on its head and she could be telling the truth.</p>
<p>Don’t give me this crap about parents being more believable either, if the guy was to abuse her then he would be willing to lie about the entire thing. There simply isn’t sufficient grounds to argue much here. Still being a child myself (16, so probably not even a year older than her), and living with my parents, I would generally never forgive them if they were to do such a thing to me. I would act like it was fine after a while, but the bitterness inside would never go away.</p>

<p>She’s a child, what do you expect…? As if any of us are perfect, all he’s doing is justifying wrong things to a child who will look back to him when she’s a parent herself.  He should have instead made a deal where she unblocks him from her facebook so he can check the nice way…</p>

              <p>[quote=“Tom_BETA, post:7, topic:432818”]The question I’d ask is how did the father actually get on the facebook to see the status? He links it with his ICT job so if he was blocked from viewing it on his account it raises the question: Did he spy on his own daughter? e.g. Keylog the family computer and so on. If not, how else would he be able to unblock himself, post the video on her wall and so on…</p>
<p>If he actually monitors his daughters habits, to even dip as low as logging her every key stroke then he is a genuine looser who needs to respect her privacy a little more. It’s one thing having Windows family safety it’s another doing that.</p>
<p>Unless he states how he did it?[/quote]</p>
<p>This is america. Children don’t have privacy from their parents. All he had to do was create a troll account and add her. She is 15 years old, she probably adds everyone anyways.</p>
<p>Its 1 thing to bitch about your parents to siblings and other family members, its another thing to post a facebook status to her 500 friends that dont need to know whats going on in her personal life. What happens behind a closed family door should stay behind it (unless for abuse). Turns out, this guy wasn’t abusing her, just gave her some chores. She made a shitty choice so she has to pay a shitty consequence, and this has nothing to do with being “redneck”. He could have done alot worse, to be honest.</p>

You are legally responsible in some states (For example Mississippi) for your child until they are of 21 years of older. You keep falling back to him putting a virus on her PC. He was putting $130 worth of software onto her PC, whats not to say she didn’t have her browser set to remember the password? Whats not to say he get it under another persons facebook?  There are so many ways that he could have found this, and you keeping falling back to a simple keylog. How do you know it wasn’t someone at his work that told him she posted it?

That’s the point I’m trying to get across, we don’t know how he actually got this information - The fact he caught her indicated a few things, he either checks regularly, or he checked once while the window was still open and read her entire wall/messages/whateverfacebookuses or he got lucky and caught her.</p>
<p>He linked it with his ICT job which sort of suggests he logged what she was typing because opening a window while he was installing software doesn’t really require ICT skills…What I’m saying is this:</p>
<p>I don’t agree if he got it through logging her PC/monitoring it, I don’t agree if he read his daughters facebook account fully - but I’m fine if it caught his eye when he was installing software. I agree children should respect there parents but parents should also respect there childrens privacy and not take it upon themselves to monitor them (if he did it that way).</p>
<p>The fact he was able to post it on her wall again also suggests that he logged her for the password, if you remember, she blocked him. Bottom line: I don’t agree with keylogging your own children, that is monitoring. I’m not saying that’s how he did it for sure but basing of what he said it sure suggests he got it through shady methods.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The bottom line is he wouldnt have to do it if his daughter wasnt rebellious and needed to be kept in line all the time[/quote]</p>
<p>This. If you catch someone with meth once, you can’t just assume they’re not going to have meth in the future, you should check them before more shit gets into the market.</p>

<p>He linked it with his ICT job which sort of suggests he logged what she was typing because opening a window while he was installing software doesn’t really require ICT skills…What I’m saying is this:</p>
<p>I don’t agree if he got it through logging her PC/monitoring it, I don’t agree if he read his daughters facebook account fully - but I’m fine if it caught his eye when he was installing software. I agree children should respect there parents but parents should also respect there childrens privacy and not take it upon themselves to monitor them (if he did it that way).</p>
<p>The fact he was able to post it on her wall again also suggests that he logged her for the password, if you remember, she blocked him. Bottom line: I don’t agree with keylogging your own children, that is monitoring. I’m not saying that’s how he did it for sure but basing of what he said it sure suggests he got it through shady methods.[/quote]</p>
<p>The bottom line is he wouldnt have to do it if his daughter wasnt rebellious and needed to be kept in line all the time</p>
