You are legally responsible in some states (For example Mississippi) for your child until they are of 21 years of older. You keep falling back to him putting a virus on her PC. He was putting $130 worth of software onto her PC, whats not to say she didn’t have her browser set to remember the password? Whats not to say he get it under another persons facebook?  There are so many ways that he could have found this, and you keeping falling back to a simple keylog. How do you know it wasn’t someone at his work that told him she posted it? Could have been anything.</p>

        <p>i don’t think he should have wasted good hardware, more like take it to his work and leave it there, tell her he broke it, and when she learns her lesson give it back to her. In my opinion I think he is being a total cunt posting this on the internet, probably humiliating her and this will cause bullying.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Tom_BETA, post:7, topic:432818”]The question I’d ask is how did the father actually get on the facebook to see the status? He links it with his ICT job so if he was blocked from viewing it on his account it raises the question: Did he spy on his own daughter? e.g. Keylog the family computer and so on. If not, how else would he be able to unblock himself, post the video on her wall and so on…</p>
<p>If he actually monitors his daughters habits, to even dip as low as logging her every key stroke then he is a genuine looser who needs to respect her privacy a little more. It’s one thing having Windows family safety it’s another doing that.</p>
<p>Unless he states how he did it?[/quote]</p>
<p>This is america. Children don’t have privacy from their parents. All he had to do was create a troll account and add her. She is 15 years old, she probably adds everyone anyways.</p>
<p>Its 1 thing to bitch about your parents to siblings and other family members, its another thing to post a facebook status to her 500 friends that dont need to know whats going on in her personal life. What happens behind a closed family door should stay behind it (unless for abuse). Turns out, this guy wasn’t abusing her, just gave her some chores. She made a shitty choice so she has to pay a shitty consequence, and this has nothing to do with being “redneck”. He could have done alot worse, to be honest.</p>

        <p>Anyhow, such a response from her parents isn’t acceptable. Consider the social ramifications of what he has done, and how that will damage her mentally. She has been humiliated in front of every person she knew, and internet strangers, that is in no way acceptable what so ever. She will lack confidence for a large portion of her life, it is one thing making an example out of her in private but publicly doing it (in front of what turned out to be millions of people, with people then leaking private information about her).</p>
<p>As I’ve said earlier on in this thread none of us are aware of the methods that her father used in order to obtain the information about what she posted on Facebook so further arguing on such a point would be silly.</p>
<p>It’s not about what he could have done, he has humiliated his daughter completely, it isn’t a good parenting technique it’s bullying to say the least. Also, about the chores point, I’m going to play the Devils Advocate here. You do realize that it boils down to his word against hers, this situation can easily be turned on its head and she could be telling the truth.</p>
<p>Don’t give me this crap about parents being more believable either, if the guy was to abuse her then he would be willing to lie about the entire thing. There simply isn’t sufficient grounds to argue much here. Still being a child myself (16, so probably not even a year older than her), and living with my parents, I would generally never forgive them if they were to do such a thing to me. I would act like it was fine after a while, but the bitterness inside would never go away.</p>

        <p>Im not saying she wasn’t telling the truth. actually, I might point out that she was stating an opinion on how she felt about how she was being treated. there is little to no truth in all opinions (simply because some believe differently then others). An unspoiled poor child might THANK him for allowing them to do chores around the house simply because it is payment for the free living and food the father supplies.</p>
<p>She never stated (in the letter he read off) that there was any type of abuse. so on that subject, there is no “his words against hers”. My point about abuse (physical or mental) was that if it wasn’t abuse then it should be concealed in the child’s home and not posted for public reviews.</p>
<p>No one is saying they are perfect(as you stated before). The reason we all agree with what he has done is because most of us have grown up to the extent that we don’t sympathize around small children’s poor choices. It was parenting to say the least, and a lot of children (especially in america) don’t even get that.</p>
<p>Time will pass, she will grow older and sooner or later forgive her father for what he has done, as her father will forgive her for what she has done. People will go on about their lives and it will quit haunting her within the years. There was no serious harm done. And the people that wont forget it are usually the every day bully she was already dealing with.</p>

<p>What we define as parenting comes from our own life experiences, we all don’t grow up and then reach the conclusion that one thing exactly is good parenting. Anything is parenting, but defining whether it was good parenting is another point.</p>
<p>People don’t just grow up and then know how to be a good parent, hell, there probably isn’t even a solid definition of good parenting. Everything in this world depends on belief progression and personal experience, which can be effected by age but not completely.</p>
<p>Where do you draw your especially in America point from again?</p>

<p>Time will pass, she will grow older and sooner or later forgive her father for what he has done, as her father will forgive her for what she has done. People will go on about their lives and it will quit haunting her within the years. There was no serious harm done. And the people that wont forget it are usually the every day bully she was already dealing with.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So your real argument is “It’ll only worsen her life for all her teenage years!”. I guess that makes it okay then. The most influential years of a females life when a lot of her personality will be put into action, and she becomes vulnerable ad unstable as she adapts to a new way of life due to growth and so forth.</p>
<p>On top of that she now has this to deal with this, an increase in bullying, low self esteem and confidence problems. Let us explore each point:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Increase bullying - Over 5.7 million teens in the USA experience bullying, now I’m going to speak from some field experience here, when I was younger I was attacked for things that weren’t really my fault (verbally) they had a field day at times about it. If something like this happened to me, I don’t know what I’d do.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>My parents, the ones who were supposed to <span class="bbcode-b">stop</span> the bullying and support me, are the ones actually fueling the fire. Now, I understand it would be my fault but I’d expect a little better from my parents, I’d expect them to respond to the situation in a more adult way than I did. The parents responding the same way she acted didn’t teach her anything, it’s treating her like a dog.</p>
<p>Let us look at extreme cases as well, if things went really bad, this could even stretch as far as suicide. The thing is, none of us know the extent of her personal issues or any background issues. You may say there is a small chance of this ever happening, but would you risk your childs demise anyway?</p>
<p>Example of what bullying can cause: <a href="http://www.care2.com/causes/10-year-old-girl-commits-suicide-after-intense-bullying.html">http://www.care2.com/causes/10-year-old-girl-commits-suicide-after-intense-bullying.html</a></p>
<p>Now in this point I speak from experience, as above, the damage I’ve had done to my confidence in earlier life still hasn’t gone away and that was more than 6 years ago. I don’t think people understand how much of a bad experience the dent gives you for a huge part of your life.</p>
<p>It restricts what you’re able to do as a person, and halts personal progress. Most people think you just wake up one morning and it’s gone. Well, it aint that simple. So I think you’ll find serious harm is done in the end.</p>
<p>If you loved your child, you would not wish to put them through what would be caused by his actions. The idea of putting them through it for the greater benefit of themselves is silly, there are other ways to go about such a situation which achieve the same end effect.</p>

        <p>how bout a compromise to this argument that i see from both of your perspectives, besides useless argueing.<br>
The teenager was in the wrong for posting, and the father was wrong for posting the video, however i will accept his punishment as its just a laptop? and he is the father. now it not usefull to argue with me for this simply fact as we all grew up from diff places and were raised differently</p>

look at the statistics of fatherless/motherless homes. A child needs both a mother and a father to get true adequate parenting, and a lot of children don't get it. whether it be because the father left the home, parent doesn't care, ect. Atleast he is standing his ground and parenting.
<p>ill argue more on it when im not enjoying my banana pudding. Arguing is a buzz-kill <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <p>I can see where you’re coming from, I don’t fully disagree with anyone on this thread just specific parts. The girl posted comments about her parents for her friends to see, the parents posted comments about their daughters for the entire world to see.</p>
<p>I think there is quite a difference when millions of internet idiots are commenting on your daughter. I’m not familiar with facebook myself but the parents should have used the facebook video feature and kept it private within her friends.</p>
<p>I have no issue with them doing that, taking the laptop, what ever. I just disagree with the famous internet dad making an example out of his child for the world to see part.</p>
<p>But none of us can really comment on it that much, because none of us know the daughter/the family at all.</p>

<p>the dad never showed a picture or gave personal details details about his daughter so it doesnt matter, the world wont know who he is talking about (except the girl’s friends and relatives)</p>
<p>all they know is some girl got some hard disciplinary action taken against her by the iron fist of her father</p>

<p>If they were going to do any sort of harm to this girl, they would have already started imo. I realize that people were asking for dox but still no REAL harm has been done yet. you think the people over the internet haven’t forgotten about this? This topic was dead for weeks until you brought it back to our attention.</p>
<p>…and besides, it was initially jessi’s AND her parents fault that her life was ruined. so i guess this story goes the same way?</p>
