<p>I do think that teens should be aloud to express their opinion on the way their parents are parenting, but at the same time, they shouldn’t have the say in the way they do their jobs.  I get sick of people saying “Wow you said one bad thing about your parent, you need to be punished”.  I don’t think parent’s should get super special treatment just because they’re your parents.</p>
<p>I believe you need to respect them considering all that they give you, but you shouldn’t be forced into agreeing with all their morals and beliefs, like many think.</p>
