    <title>I have to reload the client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-to-reload-the-client/361380</link>
    <description>Ok, this is rather annoying, and I have not figured it out. I am rather bad client-sided, tbh.

On my server, if you do the following things, you have to close your client, and open another one because the client nulls with a black screen saying, &quot;Please Wait&quot;.:

Go up a floor in Slayer Tower.
Go in the Castle Wars area* (Can&#39;t even get inside the building).
Go next to the House Portal in Taverly*.
Go into the hidden tunnel in Barrows.

Ok, for the ones that did not have an asterisk (*), when you reload the client it works.

The ones that did have the asterisk (*), you cannot even log back in; Your account becomes nulled.

I really have no idea why this happens. Someone help me?

This is a PI server and a Nick&#39;s Emulation Client.</description>
