    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-mobs-drop/405917</link>
    <description>hey guys, in my rsps version 525 my mobs drop pretty shitty items .. i mean its a rsps and i kill tormented demons and max i seen it drop was a dragon med helm and corporal beast drops addy arrows and mage outfit .... i really need to change this so ppl can actually get some items from this
can u tell me how to make it where certain mobs drop certain items and is it possible to make it so a certain item is the rarest 1 it drops? in example making it like tormented demon will give u rune 2h sword every couple kills but it can also drop d claws but make it really rare ...
srry if this sounds confusing but yeh if u got any answers plz let me know step by step ty appreciate it =]</description>
