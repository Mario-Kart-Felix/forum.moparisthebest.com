    <title>Premium Membership on DODIAN Server. PLEASE HELP! G2g soon reply plz</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/premium-membership-on-dodian-server-please-help-g2g-soon-reply-plz/232742</link>
    <description>Ok, this is what I did to make it that not everyone that creates an account and logs in is premium member:

[code]
case 4:
					// just premium
					premium = true;
					break;
				default:
					playerRights = 0;
					premium = false; - I changed this to false.
					break;
				}[/code]

Ya, I changed that part to false. But if I want to make a certain player a premium member how would I do that?
I&#39;m going to leave soon so can anyone please help before I do?

SOMEONE HELP PLZ! I REALLY GOTTA LEAVE SOON!!!! 

How do I make someone a premium member now?</description>
