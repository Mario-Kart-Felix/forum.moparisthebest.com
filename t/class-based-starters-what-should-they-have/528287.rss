    <title>Class based starters, what should they have?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/class-based-starters-what-should-they-have/528287</link>
    <description>Alright, I&#39;ve always been better at the code behind the server. I can never think of what should be in shops, what should be in drops, and definitely what should be in a starter.

I&#39;m have a class-based starter system. Instead of the not-so-classic classic Range, Mage, and Melee starters, I wanted these 3:
Skiller - Pker - Main (Both).

The skiller would (I assume) come with a bit more money than the pker (for raw materials and such), and I think would look like:
4 spots used for [hat][body][legs][boots] (Idk what to put :P)
A tin, a chisel, a knife, Bronze + Iron hatchet and pickaxe, and some a basic starter pack of items (like a few seeds and shit).

Pker:
A set of ghostly, and 2 sets of full rune. Some cash, and some weapons for pvp. Nothing skill related goes in this because, they don&#39;t want skills.

Main:
This would be a mix of the two. Cash, as always, the skiller outfit, the ghostly outfit, and 1 set of rune. Plus some runes, arrows, and a couple scims.

What should I do to improve these, and obviously I need better ideas on the outfits.</description>

              <p>[quote=“wildskiller, post:5, topic:528287”]tbh I’d have classes like Thief, Priest, and Knight because there are thousands of items you can use for each class, and you can have certain abilities and skills for each class:</p>
<p>Thief -</p>
<p>[ul][li]Skills: Ranged, Hitpoints, Defence, Thieving, Agility[/li]<br>
[li]Abilities: (Magic bow spec), (Dark bow spec) etc.[/li]<br>
[li]Equipment: Leather only, bows and daggers only[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>…and so on.</p>
<p>Anyone can make use of these classes even without client work, but just a few interface edits. Just adapt to the things you are given from the cache.</p>
<p>Starters should be the lowest leveled equipment you can find for each class.<br>

I really would love to help with this btw ;)[/quote]<br>

<p>Docent’s idea is the boss.[/quote]<br>
Yes, because a class system is totally a way to ruin it.<br>
I’ve played (Literally) at least a hundred servers, from super popular, to maybe 1 player online if you’re lucky.<br>
I ask people a hypothetical question (well, not so hypothetical, but in a sense)<br>
“If you could play a server that divided the skillers from pkers, would you?” at least 80% said yes.<br>
Lots of servers have added the “pk” skill. Yeah, and people like myself (whom like to master the game by getting 99 in all and being rich etc but don’t like PK’ing) lose out on that feat because THEY DON’T PK.<br>
So instead if you made a skill that was based off whether you PK or Skill or BOSS (Class based!) it would make it more fair and everyone could get what they want.</p>
<p>You could always add a class switcher (EX: You pay 1B to switch classes, and you don’t get a new starter.)</p>
<p>I see no way how this ruins <span class="bbcode-i">my</span> server.</p>

              <p>Alright, I’ve always been better at the code behind the server. I can never think of what should be in shops, what should be in drops, and definitely what should be in a starter.</p>
<p>I’m have a class-based starter system. Instead of the not-so-classic classic Range, Mage, and Melee starters, I wanted these 3:<br>
Skiller - Pker - Main (Both).</p>
<p>The skiller would (I assume) come with a bit more money than the pker (for raw materials and such), and I think would look like:<br>
4 spots used for [hat][body][legs][boots] (Idk what to put :P)<br>
A tin, a chisel, a knife, Bronze + Iron hatchet and pickaxe, and some a basic starter pack of items (like a few seeds and shit).</p>
<p>Pker:<br>
A set of ghostly, and 2 sets of full rune. Some cash, and some weapons for pvp. Nothing skill related goes in this because, they don’t want skills.</p>
<p>Main:<br>
This would be a mix of the two. Cash, as always, the skiller outfit, the ghostly outfit, and 1 set of rune. Plus some runes, arrows, and a couple scims.</p>
<p>What should I do to improve these, and obviously I need better ideas on the outfits.</p>
