What are you expecting from them? There a free company, there not charging a monthly cost and over 80% of their bots are free. That’s like getting mad at google cause they had a scam link on it.[/quote]<br>
They DO have a team to check them, if someone got scammed using Rsbuddy (I mean a script from them), then thats on them, not the person who added it to their deposit.</p>
