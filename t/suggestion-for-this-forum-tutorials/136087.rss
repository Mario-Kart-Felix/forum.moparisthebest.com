    <description>well i was thinking mabe (just a suggestion thats ALL) and i know this forum&#39;s moderators are doing a good job  ;) 

but this isint exactly a tutorial as well

[quote=&quot;Miss Silabsoft, post:1, topic:117587&quot;][b] you must be using a music enabled client to use this packet here is a link to one http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,169915.0.html[/b]

Packet id: 74
payload: writeWordBigEndian( song number);

sample structure
[code]
public void frame74(int i)
{
outStream.createFrame(74);
outStream.writeWordBigEndian(i);
}
[/code]

(sorry silab no effence im just useing this as a example)


example: sense this is sound, i cant really show you  an example however just try putting a frame74(15); on login then using my client.[/quote]

i mean its practicly showing what you know about it


now i think it should be more like showing how you could make it and explaining it a little as much as you can

thats what you call a tutorial not c+p and nothin els but telling how to do it (although thats how i lerned java by studying the voids ect. in them)

or this that isint showing much



and if i efended you silab i didnt mean to you have 100% right to remove this if you guys want i was just saying what i thought would help

              <p>ya u kno what u saying but</p>
<p>what silab posted affects all RS2 317 tutorials… cuz its the same packet every base of a server has to use.</p>
<p>but when you post a tutorial thats ment for 1 server base and won’t work on all server bases I guess they lock it up.</p>
<p>they accepting tutorials in my understanding those that are as general as it gets to RS2 server, not secondary.</p>
