Welcome to MachosRealm. We currently have 2 servers. A 317 server and a 718 server. The 317 is older graphics while the 718 has the newer graphics. We did this to allow players how they like to see their items. 

Both servers offer an amazing experience. Our development team updates the servers as needed so unique content is added every week. Our forums, [url=http://www.machosrealm.com]MachosRealm[/url] is well liked by our players. Chat on here and give and gain information that you need to have a great time on Machosrealm. Our staff team is mature, educated, and online all the time to give help to anyone that needs it. Our top of the line VPS gives us 100% NO LAG with both of our servers for hard development. Some of our player&#39;s computers may experience some issues at first but once you adjust your settings, you are good to go.  

Have fun and thanks for checking out Machosrealm
