    <title>See-through Chat box</title>

    <description>Hi there,

I&#39;m trying to make a clear chatbox, but just changing the area in the chat box to transparent doesn&#39;t work - I&#39;m guessing this is because the game world area doesn&#39;t extend down to the chatbox, and so the chatbox just appears to have a white background.

Does anyone know where I can find and alter the size of the gamebox in the source code, so I can edit it to include the chatbox? 

Thanks</description>
