    <title>Audio device busy? Enabling multi-media?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/audio-device-busy-enabling-multi-media/171521</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m a Fedora Core 8 user, and I&#39;m having problems with my sound card. First, when I had Fedora Core 7, everything worked fine (not sure about multi-audio). When I upgraded, it didn&#39;t detect the correct driver for my ALC888. I installed the Realtek ALC888 RHEL driver, and it installed the driver as OSS mixer. Audio works fine, but when I try to listen to two things at a time, it is impossible. When I try to play music, it uses the sound, and doesn&#39;t let any other app to use the sound. When one sound is playing, another cannot play. This is my problem.

How can I fix this problem?</description>

              <p>First off, wrong place to ask. Check out the Fedora forums.</p>
<p>rm -rf and try again. Read some guides on getting sound to work. When I did it in gentoo many year ago there was some config file changes needed to be made. Also, OSS is old, the new ALSA is what you should be using.</p>
