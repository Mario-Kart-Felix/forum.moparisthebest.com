    <title>Moparscape Client install issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-client-install-issue/76911</link>
    <description>I am having a small issue when I try installing Moparscape 3.2 I get this error

&quot;Some installation files are corrupt.
Please download a fresh copy and retry the installation&quot;

   I&#39;ve re-downloaded/re-installed the client and I keep getting this message as I install the client.





   I would be great full if someone can help me.

I do not know why but I think the system restore I recenly did created the issue because I could play Mopar b4 I did the system restore.</description>
