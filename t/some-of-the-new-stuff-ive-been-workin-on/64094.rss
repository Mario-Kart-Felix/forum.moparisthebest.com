<p>I am not going to give you moderated posts, or a mute just yet, but as your post does not comply with rule 4, (We don’t make posts that contain not useful information. Posts like “cool”, “lol”, “yeah” and “I agree” don’t contain anything useful for others. We are not fans of off topic, unless it contains something smart or funny. Most of things spammers find funny are actually not funny at all.) the next time a report comes in for you’ll be on moderated posts for 7 days. This is your final warning.</p>

<p>That’s no way to criticize other’s work. You can’t just jump out of no where and start flaming and telling him the signatures suck. But since that is your opinion, then you have two options here: Either you post some <span class="bbcode-i">actual</span> constructive criticism, or you don’t post at all.</p>

If you don’t like what I make, don’t click on anything that has my name on it, got it?<br>
Just because I don’t spend a week making something doesn’t mean I didn’t put any effort into it.<br>
The last one took about half n hour, not much time,<br>
The one for n00b took about the same… there just basic.<br>
The lil wayne took me a few minutes to make because I rushed to finish it in time.<br>
The first one took me about 40 minutes.<br>
So I didn’t take hours and hours to make something, Why should it, its not that hard.</p>

your an idiot… Just cause someone might not be as good as someone else they still have the right to learn… this is a community not a place discourage people who are learning… sure its annoying when somebody is like “wtf is java?” but this isnt the case.</p>

              <p>Seriously. This place used to be full of people who were good at graphics. And look at it now. Newbies congratulating each other on 3 minute pieces of work. I mean i know I’ve been warned but this is ridiculous. You guys have put me off graphics so much it’s unbelievable. Please just read some tutorials and DO NOT POST THE OUTCOME.</p>
<p>Refine your skills and when you make something you think is acceptable for a new topic post it then.<br>
Also what is it with the crappy signatures… try a big piece of art not a little render/stock that has your name on it.</p>
