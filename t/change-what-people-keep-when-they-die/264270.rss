Use the ! whenever you want to exclude something from a method. An example would be -</p>
<p><code>if(command.equalsIgnoreCase("noclip") &amp;&amp; (playerRights != 3)) {
disconnected = true;

<p>This means that if a player tries to use noclip, they will disconnect, BUT if that player has playerRights 3, then it will not affect them.<br>

<p>He was just providing a basic example for using the ! operator. Basically he was explaining how <span class="bbcode-b">! = does not</span></p>
