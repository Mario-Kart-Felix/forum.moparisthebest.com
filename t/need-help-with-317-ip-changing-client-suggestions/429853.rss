    <description>so far ive tryed  a bunch of 317 cient and they dont work or there not a good version. i use the mopascape webclient and it says i cant login because i need a members account. but when i run my server and look at the command prompt it ssays i successfuly logined and and then logged out because its a invalid clinet. 

so im guessing i need a more up to date 317 clinet ip changer. anyone have any suggestions please?</description>
