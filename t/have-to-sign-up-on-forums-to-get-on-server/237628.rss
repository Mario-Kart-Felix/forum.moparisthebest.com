    <description>[b]Question: How do I make is so that you have to sign up on my forums before you can get on my server?[/b]


I have alot of bots and I thought of a way to get rid off this is to make it that you have to sign up on the forums before you can get on the server. I know this is possible because I have seen alot of people do this but they never respond to me. So if anyone knows how to do this please om me or post.

                                                                           [i]Thx, d man103456[/i]</description>
