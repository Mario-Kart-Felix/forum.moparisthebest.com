    <title>Need for Speed: Shift</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-for-speed-shift/302862</link>
    <description>Well i was suprised by this game, i thought it would suck dix cuz the last NFS game to go to the track did but its actually pretty good and is going more for sim than arcade game. Ive been playing it alot and the graphics are pretty good and it seems to run pretty well at max on my card. There are quite a few cars in there and although the cool customization options of games gone by are gone its still pretty sweet. Anyone else got this? what do you think
PS if you&#39;re into the NFS games id recommend torrent it before you buy because you could hate it</description>

              <p>NFSU2 was best NFS game IMO, loads of cars, lots of parts and there was a really good Freeroam, with no police <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

The Italian Job on PS1 is better… (freeroam etc)</p>
<p>The whole point of Need for Speed in the first place was that you could have a bit of fun with a bunch of heavily customised cars. It should never become a sim, theres gran turismo for that! After the Underground games, the whole series went completely downhill. I have not bought a single NFS game since Underground 2!</p>

              <p>no free roam its only track racing, which is one of the reasons i was sceptical about getting it but its actually alright, its more sim-ish and looks fabulous as well</p>
