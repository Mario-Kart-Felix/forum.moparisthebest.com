<p>Having bank organization like that is not possible unless you modify how containers work in MoparClassic, because there is no way to place items in specific slots; the only way to modify it is via add (which is basically update if exists else insert) and remove. To get said functionality, you’re going to need to modify the way containers work in MoparClassic, which shouldn’t be done unless you know what you’re doing. If you don’t know what you’re doing, then you’re probably going to have a hard time, because it’s written in Scala, and isn’t very clear or well documented. In addition, if you aren’t exactly sure what you’re doing, you can have a very hard to find bug on your hands, as the container class is used all throughout MoparClassic and may be used in multiple threads, as indicated by the <span class="mention">@ThreadSafe</span> annotation.</p>
<p>Here is a snippet showing how complicated the container class can be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Can anyone figure out what that does without looking at the rest of the source? Probably not. Can anyone figure out what it’s used for, and why it was done that way, even if you look at the source and read the only comment in the class, which is located directly above it? Probably not.</p>
<p>Not only is it pretty complicated, but it also needs to be thread safe, as the class is annotated with the <span class="mention">@ThreadSafe</span> annotation. So, if you aren’t very comfortable with concurrency in Scala, then you probably shouldn’t modify it. In addition, if you aren’t comfortable with concurrency when called by Java and Scala, then you probably shouldn’t modify it.</p>
<p>Now, do you understand why I worded it that way, initially?</p>
<p>If no, let me put this in perspective… I’ve pretty comfortable with Scala, and even concurrency in Scala. But, in the context of MoparClassic, and the container system, even I’m not confident enough to try to implement the behavior discussed in this thread. I even understand why it must be thread safe, and I’m perfectly comfortable messing with any other class in the container system, yes, even the shop class which has some lines that are 10 tabs deep.</p>
<p>Why am I not confident in changing it? Well, let’s look at the commit this thing was implemented in… 70 files changed, 1743 adds and 6479 deletions. I can’t even scroll through the commit page on Chrome without having issues. That’s just the first commit. There are 6 other commits that modify the file, 3 of them also give Chrome issues when trying to load. Yes, at some point I personally went through every line of code and made sure nothing obvious was wrong, but that was over a period of 2 years. There have been several bug fixes in those commits, that involve the container system, and seeing how discrete the fixes were makes me not want to touch it.</p>

You missed my point and it’s not worth writing a paragraph or two for you.  It’s a simple point, and can be surmised in a few sentences, I will try in one: Anything is possible with libre software.</p>

[/quote]Do I seriously need to be more explicit? Let me rephrase the post to make it more clear…</p>
<p>Having bank organization like that is not possible unless you modify how containers work in MoparClassic, because there is no way to place items in specific slots; the only way to modify it is via add (which is basically update if exists else insert) and remove. To get said functionality, you’re going to need to modify the way containers work in MoparClassic, which shouldn’t be done unless you know what you’re doing. If you don’t know what you’re doing, then you’re probably going to have a hard time, because it’s written in Scala, and isn’t very clear or well documented. In addition, if you aren’t exactly sure what you’re doing, you can have a very hard to find bug on your hands, as the container class is used all throughout MoparClassic and may be used in multiple threads, as indicated by the <span class="mention">@ThreadSafe</span> annotation.</p>
<p>Here is a snippet showing how complicated the container class can be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Can anyone figure out what that does without looking at the rest of the source? Probably not. Can anyone figure out what it’s used for, and why it was done that way, even if you look at the source and read the only comment in the class, which is located directly above it? Probably not.</p>
<p>Not only is it pretty complicated, but it also needs to be thread safe, as the class is annotated with the <span class="mention">@ThreadSafe</span> annotation. So, if you aren’t very comfortable with concurrency in Scala, then you probably shouldn’t modify it. In addition, if you aren’t comfortable with concurrency when called by Java and Scala, then you probably shouldn’t modify it.</p>
<p>Now, do you understand why I worded it that way, initially?</p>
<p>If no, let me put this in perspective… I’ve pretty comfortable with Scala, and even concurrency in Scala. But, in the context of MoparClassic, and the container system, even I’m not confident enough to try to implement the behavior discussed in this thread. I even understand why it must be thread safe, and I’m perfectly comfortable messing with any other class in the container system, yes, even the shop class which has some lines that are 10 tabs deep.</p>
<p>Why am I not confident in changing it? Well, let’s look at the commit this thing was implemented in… 70 files changed, 1743 adds and 6479 deletions. I can’t even scroll through the commit page on Chrome without having issues. That’s just the first commit. There are 6 other commits that modify the file, 3 of them also give Chrome issues when trying to load. Yes, at some point I personally went through every line of code and made sure nothing obvious was wrong, but that was over a period of 2 years. There have been several bug fixes in those commits, that involve the container system, and seeing how discrete the fixes were makes me not want to touch it.</p>

Here is a snippet showing how complicated the container class can be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>[/quote]Who the fudge is responsible for writing such shitty code? Just because you have the ability to use features like this doesn’t mean they’re always a good idea to use. Shame on you. I don’t understand how you can be so proud of a codebase that’s hard to maintain and manage.[/quote]Not me, but it’s actually pretty straightforward if you know what you’re looking at. My last post was grossly over exaggerating because Zlacki is mentally retarded.</p>
<p>It’s taking the size required to hold the items in the list taken, and subtracting the items in the added list.</p>
<p>Here would be the equivalent Java code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int size = itms.size();

for(InvItem takenItem : taken) {
	size = getSize(takenItem.id, takenItem.amount, size);
}

for(int i = 1; i &lt; added.size(); i++) { // i = 1 for the drop 1
	size = getSize(added.get(i).id, -added.get(i).amount, size);
}</code></pre>
<p>It was written quite clearly in Scala… Here is how it could have been written, using some ‘syntactic sugar’:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">var size = ((itms.size /: taken)((s, i) =&gt; getSize(i.id, i.amount, s)) /: added.tail)((s, i) =&gt; getSize(i.id, -i.amount, s))</code></pre>
<p>That is much more ‘WTF’ to people who don’t understand Scala and does exactly the same thing. I’d also rather see either of the Scala versions in the source with a comment above it, explaining it, than see all that Java and have to figure out what it’s doing. The difference is 8 lines (with the comment) vs. 22 (with no comments) to determine if the result of a transaction is limited by the number of slots the container holds.</p>
<p>Also, the codebase is far better than what we started with, and anything that is open sourced. Let’s just look at the sheer number of lines that we had to deal with for the Bank, Inventory, and Shop classes…</p>
<p>Original:<br>
File			Lines<br>
Inventory.java	196<br>
Bank.java		146<br>
Shop.java		245<br>
Total:		587</p>
<p>Current:<br>
File			Lines<br>
Container.scala	150<br>
Inventory.scala	71<br>
Bank.scala		6<br>
Shop.scala		105<br>
Total:		332</p>
<p>Not to mention the Scala code is written in a very Java developer friendly way. It would be a lot more succinct if it was written in a more Scala-eque way.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the differences…</p>
<p>The current version is thread safe; I’d love to see this done with the Java version. Most of the methods in the original version are only a few lines, to make them thread safe, you’d need to add a few more to each, as they’re not using atomic operations.</p>
<p>The current version allows you to easily create new contains that behave very differently. Just look at the bank class… It’s basically a single line, and has no special logic in it, except for the number of slots to allow (which is a simple if statement to see if it’s a member’s world or not). Look at the inventory class… In a total of 71 lines it deals with all the inventory specific behaviors, such as dropping items on the ground if a player can’t hold it, dealing with wielding items, and so on. It also reuses all the logic for adding and removing items from the container class. The shop class only needs to change the behavior of a single method in the container class, and that’s the equals method. Everything else is reused and deals with the logic specific to shops. The part where it’s messy is the init method, caused by part of the codebase that hasn’t been modernized and is extremely clunky. The previous version? Well, nothing is reused between them, at all, so if there needs to be a change to the behavior it needs to be changed in all the classes. In addition, it’s like someone copy and pasted the same skeleton in 3 files and then changed them as needed, so if there is a bug in one, you probably need to go change 3 files instead of 1.</p>
<p>The only real issue is that there aren’t many comments, but the code is pretty clear if you know Scala. The comments in the original implementation tell you absolutely nothing useful, and are written in a way that JavaDoc standards specifically tell you to avoid. Here are all the comments and what they’re commenting in the original:</p>
<p>Bank.java</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/**
 * The maximum size of a bank
 */
public static final int MAX_SIZE = 192;</code></pre>
<p>Inventory.java</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/**
 * The maximum size of an inventory
 */
public static final int MAX_SIZE = 30;
/**
 * World instance
 */
private static World world = Instance.getWorld();</code></pre>
<p>Shop.java</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/**
 * The maximum size of an inventory
 */
public static final int MAX_SIZE = 40;
/**
 * World instance
 */
private static World world = Instance.getWorld();</code></pre>
<p>Now, let’s talk about how easy it would be to extend one of the implementations other than Container, which doesn’t exist in the original. Well, in the original, everything is private or public. About half the public methods are never used outside the class. The current version? Well, things are primarily protected and public, and the only private things are things that should be private, and have appropriate accessors and mutators.</p>
<p>Now that we know you’re not going to be able to extends the old implementation without rewriting all the logic from scratch, let’s look at the container class. The first thing we can do is look at what it can do. Well, via simple parameters in the constructor, we can set the max size, set if everything should be stackable or not, and allow slots to have values of 0 or not. So, what type of container exists in RSC that isn’t covered by those options? None, everything you can conceptually think of in RSC as a container only needs those few options. You can even turn things like the hopper in windmills or even chests into containers and it still would work. How much work would it be to make a special container for those? Almost none. Meanwhile, have fun copy, pasting, and modifying a few hundred lines in any other source to implement them.</p>
