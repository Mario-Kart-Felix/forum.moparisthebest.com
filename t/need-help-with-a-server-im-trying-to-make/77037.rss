    <title>Need help with a server im trying to make</title>

    <description>Hey, first post, sorry if this is wrong layout.

I have been trying for a while now to make a server to run. I am trying to code and test run a server, then when I get my new gaming laptop, transfer the files over to that to make the server lag free.

However, for this part, I need a couple of people to help me code up a server based on the TestScape, PimpScape, or BasicScape. 

I have tried countless times to add commands, shops, spawn monsters, etc. etc., but cannot make it work. Even now, help would appreciated, and any one willing to help me will be offered a staff spot.

Im very new to this, but I have been playing Moparscape for a while now. Im curious to make a server, but I need a little help.

Again, all help would be appreciated.
