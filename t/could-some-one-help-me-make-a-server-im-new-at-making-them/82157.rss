    <description>Umm, well if some one could please help me make a server, you will be an admin, and you will be half the owner beside me. You will also get all the privilages of the owner as well as me.

Any one want to help?

              <p>coding is basically guess and test move… you do not need a ton of skill to code, i started out not knowing how to do things i first learned how to make commands then npc’s then how to make cases, how to make mini games and dungeons and so forth… having some teach you is not the best idea because it is easiest to self guess and test… thats how i see it… so just start looking through the commands and looking at how some stuff is done for example like tutorials… i have faith in you</p>
