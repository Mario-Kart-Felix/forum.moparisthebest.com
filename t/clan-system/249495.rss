    <title>Clan System</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clan-system/249495</link>
    <description>Can anyone help me work out how to add a clan system?

I mean like the owner of the clan would type ::makeclan (clan name) then he is the owner of the clan.

Anyone that wants to join would type ::joinclan (clan name)

Only thing i would need really is how to make it so that it makes a txt doc with all the clan names and the command
can put and take clan names from there.

Also, I would like to have ::clanrankup (player name) and ::clanrankdown (playername)

If that would be possible at all then I would like help with it. Thanks.</description>
