    <description>Hey guys, it&#39;s foxownage again. I&#39;m here witha  very important problem.

Now I know about Item Duping in private servers...get to the final trade screen player clicks accept than decline quickly etc.. etc..

So that players can&#39;t dupe I would like to set it so that when you click the accept or decline (preferrably decline) button it takes 3 seconds to activate that the trade is accepted or declined.
Since you have to do the click quickly, it won&#39;t work if there is a delay.

Here is my decline button code....(IN CLICKINGMOST.JAVA)
[code]case 130:
			// Clicking some stuff in game
			int interfaceID = inStream.readSignedByte();
			 if(actionButtonId == 26018) {
				if (inTrade) {
				getClient(trade_reqId).sM(&quot;Other player has declined the trade.&quot;);
				declineTrade();
			}
		}[/code]
