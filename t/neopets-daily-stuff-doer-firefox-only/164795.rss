    <title>Neopets daily stuff doer. Firefox only!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/neopets-daily-stuff-doer-firefox-only/164795</link>
    <description>Posted this on freddy1990 and srl-forums. It does many daily tasks such as tombola and omelette and the snowager does not yet work! Yeah sorry, haven&#39;t had time to visit him asleep yet. Made this yesterday and today. :D Took 6ish hours to make. All of this is 100% my code. 


I haven&#39;t tested this in IE and most likely, it wouldn&#39;t work. Why? Well, firefox displays content way differently then IE. I used ff2 for this and at least one part (the most critical part) won&#39;t work in ie - logging in. If you do get it to work in IE, good. Post. Anyway this goes to these pages

http://www.neopets.com/bank.phtml
http://neopets.com/island/tombola.phtml
http://www.neopets.com/faerieland/wheel.phtml
http://www.neopets.com/faerieland/springs.phtml
http://www.neopets.com/desert/shrine.phtml
http://www.neopets.com/prehistoric/omelette.phtml
http://www.neopets.com/winter/adventcalendar.phtml
http://www.neopets.com/winter/snowager.phtml
http://www.neopets.com/winter/kiosk.phtml

It WILL auto-login and logout up to 15 accounts. It has a check to see if the firefox password management box comes up. It has a check to see if firefox blocks a popup (thus ruining all the coords for the script) and clicks the x and then continues happily. 

SETUP
Begins on line 388.
1) Change totUsers to match the total users you want logged in.
2) user[1]:=&#39;appazad&#39;; it goes 0 through 14 in those brackets max. Create new entries there.
3) set adx and ady to a point somewhere in the middle of the url box. 
4) Put your current resolution in the 2 variables. I&#39;ve noticed that it doesn&#39;t like it when I use findbitmap, and instead I use findbitmapin with the resolution. It also uses the max width of the resolution for the scrollbar on the right
5) Set the place where it clicks to scroll down. You only need to set the Y coord.
6) As mentioned above, change this part or even add your own here..

Warning: I have not tested the functionality of using this on more than one user at once. It may or may not work, but it should work.

-This will only work on firefox unless your IE is wacko.
-You have 5 seconds to click to the window where the neopets homepage is (scrolled up to the top)
-Your firefox font details must be default
-This should work on different firefox themes
-It keeps track of everything it does and gives warnings about not finding some things.
-DO NOT move the mouse while it&#39;s running!! Even if it accidentally clicks an ad (ex: you were an idiot and forgot you did tombola earlier and it clicks where the button should be); because this script will type in the next url and get back to the neopets site.

Example of the log (This is an actual log with a changed username - works flawlessly for me but may not work flawlessly for you!)

Here&#39;s a log from an account I just created - advent calendar takes 4 days before it lets me go there on him as well as misc other problems - it actually did click an ad once and got back and continued ON ITS OWN

Tell me how it does!
Ps: I made this entire thing in 2 days - About 4-5 hours today and 1-2 yesterday. It works great for me and I hope it works good for you others. This has only been tested to work on 1024x768 resolutions.</description>
