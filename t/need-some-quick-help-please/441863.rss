    <title>Need Some Quick Help Please :)</title>

    <description>ok so i have added a skillpoint system where you have a 50% chance of recieving +3 skillpoints when you level up a skill. it all works perfectly, except it can also give you skillpoints for combat skills. which i don&#39;t want. i will post my PlayerAssistant.java(which i know is the problem) and hopefully you guys can help!

int randomNumberSkill = 0;
randomNumberSkill = Misc.random(1);
if (randomNumberSkill == 0) {
c.skillPoints += 3;
c.sendMessage(&quot;You gained &lt;col=255125000&gt;+3&lt;/col&gt; skill points&quot;);
}
}

How can i make this so that it only give points to skills, not combat stats. i think i would have to change the whole randomNumberSkill int but idk how.. also, if u know of an easier way to do this, i will pay you.

              <p>ya so like whenever the screen that says " Congratulations… you have just advanced… blah…blah" u have a 50% change of getting 3 skillpoints which can be used in my shop. but the problem is u get skillpoints for combat stats which i dont want. i dont want to get skillpoints for attack,stength,defence, range,mage, prayer, and hp.<br>
