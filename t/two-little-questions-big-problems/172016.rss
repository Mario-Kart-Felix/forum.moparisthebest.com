    <description>[blue]I got two simple questions, that cause big problems for me[/blue]

[red]1:[/red] [green]When my server is up and running, randomly null&#39;s keep logging online, in my batch file it sais this twice apposed to once.[/green]
[code]clientHandler: accepted from COMPNAME:####[/code]
[green]Which causes null&#39;s to keep logging onto my server, it is really annoying and causes a lot of lagg.[/green]

[blue]2:[/blue] [green]When I log into my server, the HP of the player goes to 10, no matter what it was before, I changed this to 99, but now everyone that logs in has 99HP, even when they are supposed to have 10, does anyone know how to fix this, its probobly something pretty simple...[/green]</description>
