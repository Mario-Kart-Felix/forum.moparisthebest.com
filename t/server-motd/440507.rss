    <description>Moparisthebest should put this link in the MOTD: http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,479610.0.html
Since it can be clicked ingame to take you to the official sticky, new players tend to leave without registering just because they cba to read the motd and end up not knowing how to join.</description>

              <p>Since 1.2.4 according to the changelog, I was surprised too when I found out. Alot of improvements to the chat feature were added with that version, like scrolling, copy &amp; paste, colored text, etc.</p>

              <p>Maybe there should also be a link to a general help page which list all rules on the forum and server, and tells them how to get started. I think most people had get discouraged when they cant move and give up. When I first logged on, I was a bit confused about what you had to do, and that was before accounts were linked to the forum. Maybe making it easier would help get Moparcraft back up there. I know the advertising is working, i saw no less than 25 new people log on one night, and only 2 of them managed to sign in.</p>

              <p>Sounds like a good idea, though I’d also include something like “Click to open” as most people don’t know MC can open links <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
