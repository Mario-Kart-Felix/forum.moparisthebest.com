    <description>Hi my name is Kyle I have been messing around with coded since i was in sixth grade, now i am in college and am just starting computer programming classes. I want to start a Rs-ps server just for the fun of playing it and coding it to perfection. I am using trisidiax source and client i made my own home took me forever but its finally done everything is really easy to get too and its mainly a pking source i still have lots of work to do on the economy but i should be able to get it soon!

Looking for Hoster/Owner to host and be a owner on my source they will get all Donations and will have all control over the server!</description>
