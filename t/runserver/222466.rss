    <description>Yesterday my server worked fine, 30+ ppl, non-hamachi. I use uTorrent which allows me to host without port forwarding (from silab forums). I have a no-ip also. Today i runserver and no one can login. Only people can login using my hamachi ip. But it was working yesterday. I didnt change anything in uTorrent or on my no-ip.</description>
