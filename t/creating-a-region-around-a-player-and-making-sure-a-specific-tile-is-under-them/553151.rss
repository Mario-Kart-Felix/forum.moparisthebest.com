    <title>Creating a region around a player and making sure a specific tile is under them</title>

    <description>If I ever want to get anything done with this Construct Map Region packet, I need to get past this issue.

Basically, when I send a region I don&#39;t know where the player is in that region.

If I [i]just log in[/i] My player is in the middle of the region. However, if I go and run (for example) north until it loads, I will no longer be in the middle but perhaps on the 5th one down, and like 6th from the right (Thinking of the region as a grid).

When I create a region how can I ensure a player is on a specific tile.

Scenario:
I&#39;m standing at 0, 0. The area for tile is (0, 0) to (8, 8).
I want the contents of this tile to be replaced with what would be at 3200, 3200.
How do I figure out what tile in the region I am in?

Scenario 2:
I&#39;m at 3400, 3400.
I want to move a player to 0, 0 and then build a dungeon around them.
The dungeon exit (Where the player spawns) is data for 3200, 3200.
How do I ensure the tile at 0, 0 will be set to the contents of 3200, 3200?

Note:
I already have the packet working. I&#39;m just not getting the results I want when spawning stuff.</description>

              <p>I’ve already solved this honestly.</p>
<p>The only way to <span class="bbcode-i">properly</span> create a region around a player how you want is to do this:<br>
Teleport the player to the region.<br>
Build the region.<br>
Move player to specific place in region.</p>
<p>However, when doing this you will have to teleport the player and then build the region, noclip to the area you want them to spawn, and get the coords for it (Unless you have an algorithm in place).</p>

              <p>given that a tile begins at 0,0, and extends to (7,7)<br>
let a region be  n tiles long | n &gt;=1<br>
to figure offset of a region or tile, you should take</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">regionOff(c,n) = c % (n*8)
c is the coordinate
n is the number of tiles there are in a region, in c{x,y,-x,-y}'s direction </code></pre>
<p>region offset</p>
<p><code>region(c,n) =  c / (n * 8)
c is the coordinate
n is the number of tiles there are in a region, in c{x,y,-x,-y}'s direction 
</code><br>
center of a region</p>
<p><code>center(c,n) = region(c,n)*n*8 + (n+1)/2 + 4
c is the coordinate
n is the number of tiles there are in a region, in c{x,y,-x,-y}'s direction 
</code><br>
i think when the packet sends, it sends an entire region. So to make yours the middle, you have to make it relative to your players regionOff().<br>
Ex, scenario 2:<br>
You tp them to 0,0<br>
You get your regionOff(0,n) = 0<br>
the tile you want at 3200,3200 needs to be played in the [0][0] index in the sending for the packet, at least thats how i would imagine it.<br>
center of a tile in a region</p>
