    <title>Proposition For Yet Another New Feature</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/proposition-for-yet-another-new-feature/307239</link>
    <description>This is basically a post of mine in the rep thread made into its own thread because it&#39;s actually a good idea. Well, that and when I asked mopar in IRC if he had considered my post, he said that he hadn&#39;t noticed it. That thread was mostly a shitstorm of people posting their ideas without reading anyone else&#39;s, but the general consensus was that negative rep should be implemented in SMF 2, so we can use this to iron out the details for the system.

Anyway, negative rep should be implemented because it&#39;s a great way to let people know when they&#39;ve done or said something stupid without creating spam in the topic. Listed below are the features and constraints:


[ul][li]actual numbers would not be displayed; a description of the rep would be displayed instead (examples: Neutral: 0, Good 1-40, Very Good 41-100, Excellent 101+, same for negatives)[/li]
[li]names would not be displayed when giving rep; this would be to prevent wars between people[/li]
[li]the amount of bad rep would probably have to be limited per post to prevent a gangbang of some poor kid by several people[/li]
[li]it would also probably be best to restrict the amount of rep one user can give per day and also require that people rep a certain number of different people before repping a specific person again[/li]
[li]everyone would only be able to change a user&#39;s rep by 1 value; it&#39;s a community-driven feature so let the entire community participate equally[/li][/ul]


This idea isn&#39;t my own; it was implemented in another community and worked very well. So anyway, go ahead and support or refute this, but don&#39;t bother posting your shitty idea for negative rep unless it&#39;s a modification of this one.</description>

              <p>I like your idea, in addition to removing rep for warns/moderations/mutes.  The only thing I would change is I think a weighted system is a good idea, perhaps it could be weighted for positive rep but negative rep would only take away 1 at a time.  Since as Lothy said people would be more likely to hit – instead of ++, this might help even it out a little.</p>

              <p>I can see both points of view with regards to ‘weight’ attached with reputation. I’m not a fan of putting people on a pedestal though, which is essentially what weighted reputation does; this is a community forum, not a company meeting with stake holders.</p>
<p>With that said, though, obviously measures need to be put into place that stop any old person coming and having a say right from the word go - however whatever this measure is, it needs to be achievable by a ‘reasonable’ person (and, as such, probably shouldn’t depend solely on being noticed by someone influential as is currently the case); perhaps they’d receive the ‘right’ to partake in community voting after spending a time period of x without receiving any infractions.</p>
<p>The biggest problem though, as far as I’m concerned, is that people would be far more reluctant to vote positively (rep++) for someone than they would negatively.<br>
For example, the bar for receiving reputation in any useful quantity is pretty high; what exactly would it take for those same users to negative rep someone though? Probably far less.</p>
<p>For the record, I really liked the Aura system on Whirlpool as well. It could even work here now that Community Member only gives you the ability to access a general discussion section by default, rather than giving the recipient of the rank immediate access to internal cheat discussion.</p>

<p>well, i would generally think that abuse towards a certain post would come from the negative side, but limiting positive rep for a given post could certainly be implemented. it would probably be better if positive rep was kept unlimited so that when someone posts something that is of worth to many people (a deob, or whatever it is you kids play with) they can all show it. when i say negative rep should be limited, i’m strictly thinking of lawl and super pasting a link in irc and having 10 people automatically --rep.</p>

<p>you’re saying that because someone’s rep is high their opinion is more important, and i don’t really agree; if that “something” is actually pretty good then it should impress a lot of other people, right?</p>

The ‘limiting of rep per day’ is a great way to stop people from giving rep to a multiple account of theirs, assuming the limitation is strict.</p>
<p>In addition to seand’s idea, I think we should also do the warning system idea. If you get watched or muted, you will loose some rep or get some sort of rep-related penalty. Whatever works I suppose.</p>
