              <p>Pest control normally would exist south of ape atoll, however it does not exist in any conceivable serverbase other than jagex. The new client cache has it, but there’s no server base written for it yet, at least that I know about or have access to. if you want however I’ll give you a list of coordinates that I spent like night discovering, <em>was fixing doors and teleports</em>, and needed to find the underground areas. for instance all of the runecraft temples are in a straight line from west to east, with the exception of the death temple which curves off to the south. Here’s the coords. Personally I have no idea what the skyscraper thing is, and I could’ve swore that jagex got rid of the blackhole… guess not.</p>
<p>//Coords to repair/add entrance to - Sonjichan</p>
<p>2978,9871 = blackhole<br>

2462,4775 = Frog Token Island<br>

1890,4517 = Mysterious skyscraper.<br>
1867,4621 = Death Temple<br>
2127,3930 = Weird dark wildly area (perhaps cheezscape only)<br>
2375,4393 = Zanaris<br>
2460,4382 = Strange mining area<br>
2589,4499 = Gnome glider hanger.<br>
2664,4707 = Miscellania<br>
2795,4585 = Odd mining caverns<br>
