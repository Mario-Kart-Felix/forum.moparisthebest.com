    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-in-a-function-for-jmenu-on-client/309406</link>
    <description>Hey Guyz well i was wondering how do i add in a Server Ip Menu Function on a JMenu like i want to add in a Tab Called &quot;Worlds&quot; and one will be to a different ip and the other will be to another. So like i can change ips. back and forth using that function ?


Is it possible. Example If i want to go to World 2 I go to The World Tab on the Client. Then Click World 2 and the Ip changes. Can it be done if so please can u paste the code and were to post it? under Gui?


Like i want to be able to switch through ip&#39;s using this function i remember a client that had it. Thanks</description>
