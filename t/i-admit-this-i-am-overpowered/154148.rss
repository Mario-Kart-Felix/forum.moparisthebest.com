    <title>I admit this. I am overpowered</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-admit-this-i-am-overpowered/154148</link>
    <description>Haunted, a novel. By Chuck Palahniuk, the same guy who wrote Fight Club. This book is.. disgusting...

I heard about this book few years ago.. My friend told me about a horrible book that I needed to stay away from. I thought, I can handle anything.

Then, this year my friend Heather tells me about this disgusting book her brother loaned her, how it made her sick, how that&#39;s why she didn&#39;t come to school the day before. She told me one of the plot details, I tell her yeah, I can handle that, easy. I ask her if I could borrow the book when she&#39;s done with it, she tells me even if it was hers, she didn&#39;t think I can handle it, and I think that&#39;s saying something.

So my little smart ass determined self decides hes gonna look for ebook torrents. I can find any ebooks, only audio. In the process I learn that Chuck Palahniuk is a really twisted guy. I read Fight Club, the guy is smart, and it was on the darker side, but I figured, how bad could it be.

I&#39;m now 45 minutes into the audio book. I have to take a break. I feel sick, and I feel like I&#39;m going to throw up. Not many books can make me say things allowed. This book is the only one that&#39;s made me feel like this.

To anyone with a weak stomach, stay away from this book, for those who read it, how did you feel after the masturbation tragedies? I haven&#39;t gotten any further, my friend Heather says they get more gruesome as the book goes on. I want to finish it, I really do. I just don&#39;t know if I can.

Please give feedback if you&#39;ve read or want to.

Edit:
Since you&#39;ve asked for me to tell you what this is about, I will.

It is about a few people going on a &quot;writers retreat&quot; for 12 weeks. It is actually a survivor like game for writers, where the people have to write horrible twisted poems or short stories. This is what I know so far, that and there is 23 stories and poems.</description>

<p>found a plot thing:</p>
<p>HAUNTED is a novel made up of stories: twenty-three of them, to be precise. Twenty-three of the most horrifying, hilarious, mind-blowing, stomach-churning tales you’ll ever encounter—sometimes all at once. They are told by people who have answered an ad headlined “Artists’ Retreat: Abandon Your Life for Three Months” and who are led to believe that here they will leave behind all the distractions of “real life” that are keeping them from creating the masterpiece that is in them. But “here” turns out to be a cavernous and ornate old theater where they are utterly isolated from the outside world—and where heat and power and, most important, food are in increasingly short supply. And the more desperate the circumstances become, the more desperate the stories they tell—and the more devious their machinations become to make themselves the hero of the inevitable play/movie/nonfiction blockbuster that will certainly be made from their plight</p>

              <p>Haunted, a novel. By Chuck Palahniuk, the same guy who wrote Fight Club. This book is… disgusting…</p>
<p>I heard about this book few years ago… My friend told me about a horrible book that I needed to stay away from. I thought, I can handle anything.</p>
<p>Then, this year my friend Heather tells me about this disgusting book her brother loaned her, how it made her sick, how that’s why she didn’t come to school the day before. She told me one of the plot details, I tell her yeah, I can handle that, easy. I ask her if I could borrow the book when she’s done with it, she tells me even if it was hers, she didn’t think I can handle it, and I think that’s saying something.</p>
<p>So my little smart ass determined self decides hes gonna look for ebook torrents. I can find any ebooks, only audio. In the process I learn that Chuck Palahniuk is a really twisted guy. I read Fight Club, the guy is smart, and it was on the darker side, but I figured, how bad could it be.</p>
<p>I’m now 45 minutes into the audio book. I have to take a break. I feel sick, and I feel like I’m going to throw up. Not many books can make me say things allowed. This book is the only one that’s made me feel like this.</p>
<p>To anyone with a weak stomach, stay away from this book, for those who read it, how did you feel after the masturbation tragedies? I haven’t gotten any further, my friend Heather says they get more gruesome as the book goes on. I want to finish it, I really do. I just don’t know if I can.</p>
<p>Please give feedback if you’ve read or want to.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Since you’ve asked for me to tell you what this is about, I will.</p>
<p>It is about a few people going on a “writers retreat” for 12 weeks. It is actually a survivor like game for writers, where the people have to write horrible twisted poems or short stories. This is what I know so far, that and there is 23 stories and poems.</p>
