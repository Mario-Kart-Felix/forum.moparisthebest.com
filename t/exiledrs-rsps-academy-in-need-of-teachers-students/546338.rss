    <description>Hello!  

WELCOME TO RSPS-ACADEMY! ||   ANYONE IS WELCOME I DON&#39;T CARE OF YOUR EXPERIENCE.

I am a Server/Client/web developer


I do not want experienced developers, this development team will be for learning purposes only.
I however am quite experienced with rsps, experienced in java, perl, lua, unix shell, ruby, js ( ofc the scripting languages as i mentioned above im also a web dev)  and as well as some knowledge of other languages, ex python, c, c++, pascal, vbscript, and lisp.



TEACHER POSITIONS:
you will need to be experienced in rsps and java.
no ifs ands or buts, MUST be kind, generous and
respectful, any discouragement or just being a plain ass
to the students will not fly by me, you&#39;ll be fired on the spot.

Prices for teachers will be set up, at a later time.
as of for now, im looking for kind experienced developers
willing to give some time in every once in awhile to help some new guys.

If your a jerk and wanting to apply i will not accept you,
 won&#39;t even get the courtesy of me leaving you a reply.

ima nice person i don&#39;t deal with people like that.

TEACHERS JOB:
Teachers will be Writing the tutorials for whatever they specialize in.

Me and the other java developers will be writing the tutorials for java. (will most likely be just me so i can keep it more organized.)

Occasionally there will be students needing extra help or understanding thats when the actual teacher&gt;student interaction goes about.
there won&#39;t be any spoon feeding unless needed.
and even if we DID do it for them its up to them to look and actually pay attention to what we&#39;ve done.
which we will fully explain as well.
If the student is willing to learn he/she WILL learn.
if they don&#39;t learn its their fault.
not my teachers fault.

will update accordingly, if you have any questions please ask.

UPDATE:
this program will have its TEACHERS and its STUDENTS
If this program fits the needs of the new ones will think about
creating a site like codecademy but for java and rsps related activities.


Also to answer a question
&quot;whats the catch&quot;
there is no catch,
We teach you learn thats it.
im not going to give a big speech about how care about the community
but i do know that new developer need to be SET on the right path, seriously though.
there is too much confusions and too many jerks to learn by yourself properly.
thats why we&#39;re here.

This is explicitly for learning! 
wanna learn some programming and New things about rsps?
please post or pm your skype.

I&#39;ll give you basic guidelines and rules that we WILL follow
you don&#39;t wanna follow them then no learning for you.
this a great opportunity i&#39;ve opened up for you, don&#39;t
mess it up by being one of the ignorant. 


As of what we will be developing.
that is up to the newer developers.
we&#39;ll have a vote/poll or we&#39;ll decide on something we all agree on.

This is how its going to work.
----------------------------

Every developer is going to download the a source they want (will have to be the revision the newer developers voted on)
and we will start from there, we&#39;ll show you whatcha you need when you need it and you can be set off into the beautiful worl of programming.

REMINDER TO THE TEACHERS:
When a Developer asks you for something your are NOT to spoon feed them, show him what him/her what she needs to know to get the job done and maybe a hint on where to start and thats all they need, a part of learning programming is trial and error let them experience that for themselves. (unless its something small then you may tell them directly, EXAMPLE: changing prices or spawns etc.)

Now as of the main server.
i&#39;ll be hosting this you will be able to test your knowledge on it after a point.
mainly after ik whatever it is that you know about rsps, and/or programming.

simple enough?
 
YOU WILL HAVE A CHOICE ON WORKING WITH OTHER STUFF BESIDES RSPS
THIS WILL IMPROVE DIFFERENT AREAS OF PROGRAMMING FOR YOU.

You may as well post what you have learned on this thread, to show your progress.

Sorry about the thread looking so ugly. 
hard to make it look good with white background.
ill make it look nice when i have the time.

Thank you for reading this somewhat long and boring post.

UPDATES:
[spoiler]
Teacher Positions have been added.
Want to apply for a Server sided, client sided, or even a website development teacher?
add my skype: ExiledBotter.

RsPsAcademy has been started[/spoiler]</description>

You do not need to approach every “student” with a happy, friendly tone. There are times your “student” will act like a total idiot (when they’re not) and you just have to tell them to shut the fudge up and listen for a minute. Having teachers only being “nice and generous” will get you a bunch of pushovers, that will just write the code for the “student” and they won’t learn anything. Kind of would ruin the whole point of <span class="bbcode-b">teaching</span> them anything if it was all done for them (because what would they have learned?).</p>
<p>You need qualified candidates that know how to program <span class="bbcode-u">and</span> know how to teach. Because not everyone does, some might know how to teach but not program, others might know how to program but not teach, and then there are the ones that know neither.[/quote]</p>

              <p>Hello!</p>
<p>WELCOME TO RSPS-ACADEMY! ||   ANYONE IS WELCOME I DON’T CARE OF YOUR EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p>I am a Server/Client/web developer</p>
<p>I do not want experienced developers, this development team will be for learning purposes only.<br>
I however am quite experienced with rsps, experienced in java, perl, lua, unix shell, ruby, js ( ofc the scripting languages as i mentioned above im also a web dev)  and as well as some knowledge of other languages, ex python, c, c++, pascal, vbscript, and lisp.</p>
<p>TEACHER POSITIONS:<br>
you will need to be experienced in rsps and java.<br>
no ifs ands or buts, MUST be kind, generous and<br>
respectful, any discouragement or just being a plain ass<br>
to the students will not fly by me, you’ll be fired on the spot.</p>
<p>Prices for teachers will be set up, at a later time.<br>
as of for now, im looking for kind experienced developers<br>
willing to give some time in every once in awhile to help some new guys.</p>
<p>If your a jerk and wanting to apply i will not accept you,<br>
won’t even get the courtesy of me leaving you a reply.</p>
<p>ima nice person i don’t deal with people like that.</p>
<p>TEACHERS JOB:<br>
Teachers will be Writing the tutorials for whatever they specialize in.</p>
<p>Me and the other java developers will be writing the tutorials for java. (will most likely be just me so i can keep it more organized.)</p>
<p>Occasionally there will be students needing extra help or understanding thats when the actual teacher&gt;student interaction goes about.<br>
there won’t be any spoon feeding unless needed.<br>
and even if we DID do it for them its up to them to look and actually pay attention to what we’ve done.<br>
which we will fully explain as well.<br>
If the student is willing to learn he/she WILL learn.<br>
if they don’t learn its their fault.<br>
not my teachers fault.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>will update accordingly, if you have any questions please ask.</p>
<p>UPDATE:<br>
this program will have its TEACHERS and its STUDENTS<br>
If this program fits the needs of the new ones will think about<br>
creating a site like codecademy but for java and rsps related activities.</p>
<p>Also to answer a question<br>
"whats the catch"<br>
there is no catch,<br>
We teach you learn thats it.<br>
im not going to give a big speech about how care about the community<br>
but i do know that new developer need to be SET on the right path, seriously though.<br>
there is too much confusions and too many jerks to learn by yourself properly.<br>
thats why we’re here.</p>
<p>This is explicitly for learning!<br>
wanna learn some programming and New things about rsps?<br>
please post or pm your skype.</p>
<p>I’ll give you basic guidelines and rules that we WILL follow<br>
you don’t wanna follow them then no learning for you.<br>
this a great opportunity i’ve opened up for you, don’t<br>
mess it up by being one of the ignorant.</p>
<p>As of what we will be developing.<br>
that is up to the newer developers.<br>
we’ll have a vote/poll or we’ll decide on something we all agree on.</p>
<h2>This is how its going to work.</h2>
<p>Every developer is going to download the a source they want (will have to be the revision the newer developers voted on)<br>
and we will start from there, we’ll show you whatcha you need when you need it and you can be set off into the beautiful worl of programming.</p>
<p>REMINDER TO THE TEACHERS:<br>
When a Developer asks you for something your are NOT to spoon feed them, show him what him/her what she needs to know to get the job done and maybe a hint on where to start and thats all they need, a part of learning programming is trial and error let them experience that for themselves. (unless its something small then you may tell them directly, EXAMPLE: changing prices or spawns etc.)</p>
<p>Now as of the main server.<br>
i’ll be hosting this you will be able to test your knowledge on it after a point.<br>
mainly after ik whatever it is that you know about rsps, and/or programming.</p>
<p>simple enough?</p>
<p>YOU WILL HAVE A CHOICE ON WORKING WITH OTHER STUFF BESIDES RSPS<br>
THIS WILL IMPROVE DIFFERENT AREAS OF PROGRAMMING FOR YOU.</p>
<p>You may as well post what you have learned on this thread, to show your progress.</p>
<p>Sorry about the thread looking so ugly.<br>
hard to make it look good with white background.<br>
ill make it look nice when i have the time.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this somewhat long and boring post.</p>
<p>UPDATES:<br>
[spoiler]<br>
Teacher Positions have been added.<br>
Want to apply for a Server sided, client sided, or even a website development teacher?<br>
add my skype: ExiledBotter.</p>
<p>RsPsAcademy has been started[/spoiler]</p>
