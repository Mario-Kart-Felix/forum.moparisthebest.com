    <title>New to Java Development.. Where to begin?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-to-java-development-where-to-begin/544156</link>
    <description>Hello,

Just a little information, I have always been very interested in Java development since i have first learned about RSPS development. When i started to get into that, i learned very vague knowledge of Java.

I have seen many Java programs created and Java games (other than RSPS) and it just makes me want to learn Java coding even more, but i am clueless on where to begin.

I decided to post here as i know there are many great Java developers here on this site that may be able to direct me to something that could help me? or remotely give me tiny lessons with the very basics over teamviewer? I just am interested in learning the basics of Java and then expanding to higher levels but i don&#39;t know where to begin or what to start with.

Does anyone have suggestions on where to start? What did everyone else first start off with?

(Note: i have eclipsed installed if that helps any with begging)</description>

              <p>The book I used myself was: Java Software Solutions foundations of program design. It covers declaring variables, creating functions, making classes, creating GUI contents and idk what else. But definitely wourth a look at. There are also some PDF versions going around on the web.</p>
<p>Goodluck!</p>

              <p>I recommend that you buy a book to start off. The book “Introduction to Java programming” is great. It covers a wide range of topics. If you know what you want to learn, it’s both easy and usually free to learn by searching on the Internet.</p>
