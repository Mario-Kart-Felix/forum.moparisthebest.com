[SIZE=3]Welcome to the Lost[COLOR=#ffa500]C[/COLOR]ause Advertisement
we are what alot of people who&#39;ve playd would call us an older generation server with a twist.
We&#39;ve were in beta for a couple of days with a few people playing and created/edited the server entirely after theyr opinions and thoughts which is important for us, to listen to the players and what it will take to make them enjoy the game.

So we built a two in one server kind of which means you can choose at the start if you wish to play on the spawn side of the server and spawn your wanted items with a small restriction and just go to PK straight away. Or choose the economy side of the server which means no spawning at all. But with legit training, both melee and skills, explore the unique training/slayer dungeons and areas also throw yourself into our well thought out quests which you may like!

[IMG]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35320740/LostCause/News_announcements_2.gif[/img][COLOR=#ffa500][SIZE=5]Some features we got on our server is:[/SIZE][/COLOR]

* All skills working properly and no hazzle
* Unique bosses/training areas and dungeons
* A well planned out economy
