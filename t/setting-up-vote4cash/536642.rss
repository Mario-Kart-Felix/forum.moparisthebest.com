    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-up-vote4cash/536642</link>
    <description>well ive already got 99% of this done, all that i need is my vote.php link. Now how exactly would i get this? im using 000webhost i added the vote.php but when i put that address in my client class it wont load, partly because i used the wrong link. How Exactly would i find my direct vote.php link so when the player types ::vote it brings up the page? I followed this tutorial- http://www.runelocus.com/forums/showthread.php?67172-PI-Vote4Cash-Tutorial Can someone please help me this is really bothersome, if this is wrong section let me know.</description>
