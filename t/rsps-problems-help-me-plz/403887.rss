    <title>Rsps problems [Help me plz]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-problems-help-me-plz/403887</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m playing for a long time a good rsps, but yesterday I got a clost at Ape Atoll. Many other players got that clost too, since then I haven&#39;t acces too my account. The moderators kicked my a several times because at login it says: &quot;You&#39;re already logged in. Try again in 5 minutes.&quot; But it won&#39;t help. I can make an another account and log in on that, but not at my main account. The second thing it says at logIn: &quot;Error connecting to server. Please reload client and try again.&quot; I have done it several times, and I have deleted the cache many times, but nothing helps. Can anybody help me?  :confused:

Thx, Mark  :D</description>
