    <title>[PI] Drops don&#39;t show up for players? [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-drops-dont-show-up-for-players-pi/437392</link>
    <description>I really need help...

I went on many other sites to try to find this..

Here is the issues:
A player can drop items but the items never show up for the players to see them.. Now, some players made a report saying I killed someone and got there att cape. So then i thought only non tradeable items will show up and when you kill someone only non tradable items show..


Can someone please i beg you help me.
