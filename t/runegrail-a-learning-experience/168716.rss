    <title>RuneGrail: A learning experience</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runegrail-a-learning-experience/168716</link>
    <description>This is a living thread meaning it is constantly evolving, check back every now and then for Updates.

Well, 3 days ago (Update: it&#39;s been more than 3 days now) I started research on the Runescape client and decided to see what the Bot development process was like. After gleaning information from IRC #mopar with the help of people such as frank_, Thug-life, Rictoo, yakman, Miss Silabsoft, and newbiehacker I was able to come up with a simple bot that loads the RS client using the default applet and has the capability to print out the number of Players on the current field. Despite the fact that I knew BCEL/reflection and Java fairly well, I still found it difficult to make progress from scratch. I refrained from referencing other open source bots as that would defeat the purpose of this learning experiencing. The people who developed the first Runescape bot with nothing to reference but your own minds (whoever you are, and you know who you are.) have my utmost respect.

At any rate, [b]I do plan on making a very detailed tutorial about the Bot development process[/b] once I learn the ins and outs of the Runescape Client. It won&#39;t be a tutorial on BCEL, or reflection, or Java. You&#39;ll need to read it with those skills already available. What it will be is a document to launch new developers into the Runescape Bot development process because as of now there doesn&#39;t seem to be any real enthusiasm for the subject in the first place because of in-game updates as well as just plain not caring about the game anymore.

In the meantime, [b]the source (and a compiled version) for my simple program is attached to this document[/b]. It was built not to be anything special (at least not yet), but as a way to see what the development process is like without copying directly from other bots.

Final Note: For those of you that attempt to jump into the Runescape cheating scene so late (like myself) I feel extremely sorry for you if you do so without first reading the document I am preparing (if I get it finished haha.) because getting the proper people to discuss the development process (when they have gone through the task themselves several times over) when they benefit virtually zero from anything you accomplish except to have their name mentioned briefly somewhere in some type of [b]docs/Credits.txt[/b] is a complete pain in the ass. I&#39;d also like to say that of the 3 days I spent trying to research i.e; bothering frank_ and the others, only 1 of them was spent coding. Once again, I have the UTMOST respect for those that were at the root of bot development.

If you have any questions [b]feel free to catch me on IRC under the nickname dafan[/b]

[b]If you are an ancient bot developer or a slick new upstart, I would love to here your stories as well as development process. [/b]PLEASE Contact me and .dump() all the information you can on me so that I can incorporate it into my document or at least put it to practical use, I can virtually guarantee that I won&#39;t let your information fall on deaf ears as I am serious about this. Everything I do will be Open Source as I have no intention of actually playing Runescape, I just believe this to be a fascinating subject which I am fully prepared to invest much of my spare time into despite the current slump that the game seems to be in.

Exclusive Interview with regecks &lt;-- This guy is a crazy good programmer and I want to be like him one day. Some editing had to be made to keep it clean.

&lt;regecks_fan&gt; regecks, Can I interview you?
&lt;regecks&gt; o
                   ok
&lt;regecks_fan&gt; What got you interested in becoming a programmer, but more specifically a legendary programmer?
&lt;regecks&gt; da c*cks
&lt;regecks_fan&gt; regecks, I hear that you are approaching the limit to how much a human memory can store with your intimate knowledge of the Runescape client? Does this scare you?
&lt;regecks&gt; regecks_fan i just stick it in my pooper
&lt;regecks_fan&gt; regecks, Are you a master of Regular Expressions and forming meaningful patterns?
&lt;regecks&gt; ya
                   ya i am
                   der&#39;s good response
&lt;/End of Interview&gt;

As you can see, it is not a walk in the park to get people to talk seriously, but I will see what I can do about it.

              <p>shangtsung1, That happens to me every now and then too, it’s due to RuneGrail trying to obtain the Canvas too fast. Try reloading it a couple of times and see if it works. I’ll see if I can’t fix this problem fully in the next update.</p>

I started after aryan / game engine update, where the client was a lot harder then before, and i like to think I’v got a similar amount of knowledge as some old-timers here.</p>
<p>iv got a suggestion about your compiling, if you use a little tool called <a href="http://ant.apache.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Apache Ant</a>, it can compile and make jars and all that, in other words it can “build” a project.<br>
I think its much nicer then .bat or .sh files.<br>
have a look when you’ve got time.</p>

              <p>This is a living thread meaning it is constantly evolving, check back every now and then for Updates.</p>
<p>Well, 3 days ago (Update: it’s been more than 3 days now) I started research on the Runescape client and decided to see what the Bot development process was like. After gleaning information from IRC <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> with the help of people such as frank_, Thug-life, Rictoo, yakman, Miss Silabsoft, and newbiehacker I was able to come up with a simple bot that loads the RS client using the default applet and has the capability to print out the number of Players on the current field. Despite the fact that I knew BCEL/reflection and Java fairly well, I still found it difficult to make progress from scratch. I refrained from referencing other open source bots as that would defeat the purpose of this learning experiencing. The people who developed the first Runescape bot with nothing to reference but your own minds (whoever you are, and you know who you are.) have my utmost respect.</p>
<p>At any rate, <span class="bbcode-b">I do plan on making a very detailed tutorial about the Bot development process</span> once I learn the ins and outs of the Runescape Client. It won’t be a tutorial on BCEL, or reflection, or Java. You’ll need to read it with those skills already available. What it will be is a document to launch new developers into the Runescape Bot development process because as of now there doesn’t seem to be any real enthusiasm for the subject in the first place because of in-game updates as well as just plain not caring about the game anymore.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <span class="bbcode-b">the source (and a compiled version) for my simple program is attached to this document</span>. It was built not to be anything special (at least not yet), but as a way to see what the development process is like without copying directly from other bots.</p>
<p>Final Note: For those of you that attempt to jump into the Runescape cheating scene so late (like myself) I feel extremely sorry for you if you do so without first reading the document I am preparing (if I get it finished haha.) because getting the proper people to discuss the development process (when they have gone through the task themselves several times over) when they benefit virtually zero from anything you accomplish except to have their name mentioned briefly somewhere in some type of <span class="bbcode-b">docs/Credits.txt</span> is a complete pain in the ass. I’d also like to say that of the 3 days I spent trying to research i.e; bothering frank_ and the others, only 1 of them was spent coding. Once again, I have the UTMOST respect for those that were at the root of bot development.</p>
<p>If you have any questions <span class="bbcode-b">feel free to catch me on IRC under the nickname dafan</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">If you are an ancient bot developer or a slick new upstart, I would love to here your stories as well as development process. </span>PLEASE Contact me and .dump() all the information you can on me so that I can incorporate it into my document or at least put it to practical use, I can virtually guarantee that I won’t let your information fall on deaf ears as I am serious about this. Everything I do will be Open Source as I have no intention of actually playing Runescape, I just believe this to be a fascinating subject which I am fully prepared to invest much of my spare time into despite the current slump that the game seems to be in.</p>
<p>~unlimitedorb</p>
<p>Exclusive Interview with regecks &lt;-- This guy is a crazy good programmer and I want to be like him one day. Some editing had to be made to keep it clean.</p>
<p>&lt;regecks_fan&gt; regecks, Can I interview you?<br>
 o<br>
ok<br>
&lt;regecks_fan&gt; What got you interested in becoming a programmer, but more specifically a legendary programmer?<br>
 da c*cks<br>
&lt;regecks_fan&gt; regecks, I hear that you are approaching the limit to how much a human memory can store with your intimate knowledge of the Runescape client? Does this scare you?<br>
 regecks_fan i just stick it in my pooper<br>
&lt;regecks_fan&gt; regecks, Are you a master of Regular Expressions and forming meaningful patterns?<br>
 ya<br>
ya i am<br>
der’s good response<br>
&lt;/End of Interview&gt;</p>
<p>As you can see, it is not a walk in the park to get people to talk seriously, but I will see what I can do about it.</p>
