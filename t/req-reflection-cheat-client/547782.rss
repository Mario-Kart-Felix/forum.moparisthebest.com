    <title>[REQ] Reflection Cheat Client ----</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-reflection-cheat-client/547782</link>
    <description>[b]whats up whats up moparscape?[/b]
just curious as to how I might go about getting some commands for the Reflection cheat client
Ive tried simple commands ive made myself that send a fake packet. for instance
sending the trade interface
then sending the trade accept packet
but alas, they never work :(
might as well consult the pros.... :palm: :palm: :palm:

--edit* also if its possible. any way to make a command that thinks i&#39;m clicking on an ore rock and my player interacts? or any object for that matter.</description>
