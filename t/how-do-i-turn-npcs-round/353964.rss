    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-turn-npcs-round/353964</link>
    <description>All my Npc&#39;s face south when i add them to the game, could someone tell me how to get them to face other directions (north, east, west). I know it can be done, ive seen it on many other servers. And before some smart kid says to google it or check for guides on how to do it, I HAVE ALREADY and have found nothing.</description>
