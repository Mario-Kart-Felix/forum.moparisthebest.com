    <description>Hello everyone, I&#39;m trying to add a custom Castle Wars interface and I have the interface where I want it, I just can&#39;t figure out how to add the timer and where it says: Zamorak Players: #. I think I need to use Cycle Events but I&#39;m not sure how to add it, also I don&#39;t know how to place the text in the right position. Help would be appreciated! Thanks!</description>
