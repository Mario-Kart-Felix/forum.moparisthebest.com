    <title>Portforwarding Wierd?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-wierd/419319</link>
    <description>Okay so i have been able to portforward with my verizon router to connect to my old rsps which was hybrid pvp edited since then i shut the server down. now i want to start a new server but i&#39;ve noticed my verizon ports have stopped working? My router says their still active but according to the rsps and open port checkers it isnt. i have tried erasing the ports and reopening them and thats not working either. However i have tried Utorrent to portforward and it seems to work the thing is everytime i restart my cpu i have to portforward with utorrent again. so someone please help me here i want my verizon ports to be working !!!

Extra information:
yes my no-ip is open
yes the server is on my no-ip
yes when i portforward with utorrent my friends can play
and yes when i check open port checker with my utorrent ports open it says the port is open.
I have windows 7

Edit: i dont know if this is in right section but someone please tell me the possible problem why my verizon ports that i opened from logging into my router at 192.168.1.1 arent working.</description>
