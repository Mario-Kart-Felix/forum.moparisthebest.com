    <description>Ive been coding a source for a month or two now and its looking pretty dam good. and within the next few months i plan on starting my own server along with a website. But first im going to code a blank source [pi] of course and make sure i like the way it feels. so i have 3 questions.

Should i use a vps , if so what gb , and whats the average prices for this ?
What are good website hosting sites that arent to expensive. &amp; or have an option to buy for life instead of monthly.
Should i host it on vps or my computer ?</description>

              <p>VPS without a doubt, you won’t need anything big to start off, get the smallest possible, because obviously if you’re buying a VPS that can hold like 500+ players when you like a 10 playerbase, it’s a waste of money.</p>
<p>As for forums, free forums are good whilst you’re on low players, then you may want to consider moving to a paid forum. Or at least free forums with a cheap domain.</p>
