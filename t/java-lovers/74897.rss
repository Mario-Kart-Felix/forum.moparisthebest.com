    <description>I was not sure where to put this post as it is advertising but i did read the rules and was still at a lose of where to post. Now I have been working for a few days on some guilds.


[ul][li]Java Guild[/li]
[li]php Guild[/li]
[li]HTML Guild[/li]
[li]Hackers Guild[/li][/ul]

Although it is not completed I have somewhat opened the Java Guild. This guild is for those of you who are truly skilled at java. Sadly this is not free. The guilds require payment one payment for a lifetime.*

javaguild.h4ckers-network.com

Registration is disabled but once the guild gets started it will be well worth the $$.</description>
