    <title>God of War 2-3 (is atlas still alive)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/god-of-war-2-3-is-atlas-still-alive/334855</link>
    <description>Hades took Atlas&#39;s soul with his chains, but when Kratos kills Hades in God of War 3 all the souls are let free, so is Atlas still alive?

Also there are a few other Titans who are marked unknown to death, Epimetheus and Oceanus

Epimetheus falling into a whirl pool and unknown if  he escaped
Oceanus being pulled off Mount Olympus by Hades, but no one knows what happens after.


Know anything that I don&#39;t?</description>
