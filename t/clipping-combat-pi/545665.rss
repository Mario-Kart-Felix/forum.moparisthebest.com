    <title>Clipping combat [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clipping-combat-pi/545665</link>
    <description>So Im trying to add combat clipping to my PI server, its an oldschool PI. I&#39;ve put a lot of work into this server so getting a new base isn&#39;t the option i&#39;m looking for. I&#39;ve searched google but found nothing except old help threads that people have requested money for, I added clipped following and it worked perfectly but players can still no clip through walls with attacking an npc.

If anyone knows a tutorial on this, or how to add it, it would be greatly appreciated. Or even help me understand how to add it, cause at the moment I&#39;m not sure.</description>

<p>This belongs in server help as you’re looking for server sided clipping.<br>
There’s a great tutorial in the tutorials section by ‘asshole’ which most server use nowadays since it’s pretty decent.<br>

<p>Ah i see I wasn’t sure whether to put in Server or Client. But thanks I’ll see if i can find it.<br>
followed this guide and now following is clipped, but can’t seem to incorporate combat into it.</p>
<p>If you’re talking about using this guide the links are dead…<br>

I’ve already posted a new link. asshole can’t edit his post to change the links (even if he wanted to) because the forum software disables it after like 15 days.</p>
