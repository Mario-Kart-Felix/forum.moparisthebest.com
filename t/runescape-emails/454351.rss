    <title>Runescape - Emails</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-emails/454351</link>
    <description>I recently got an account that has an email registered to it.

I want to change the email, but the only way I can find is by making it send an email to the email registered, which I do not have a password for. Is there any other way to change a email</description>

<p>Anyway, the point is is I can verify who you are on this forum using your ISP fairly easily. People rarely change ISPs. Nevertheless, you are also fairly easy to track because you have a static IP (for example, <span class="bbcode-b">your account on here only has like 3-4 IPs connected to it</span>). Other users (say, from the old bigpond hostname from some crappy aussie ISP) have a dynamic IP. They dont change ISPs, but some of their accounts on here may have over 100 unique IPs associated with it. There’s accurate way to track/verify a user based on IP alone, unless you can verify it’s static (and even then, in terms of consistently using multiple ISPs, that approach goes wry). Your only option is to try and use the most commonly used ISP(s) for an account to try and verify its authenticity.<br>

Only <span class="bbcode-b">four</span> IP addresses from Loveandpower’s 8307 posts?</p>
<p>How many IP addresses have I posted from?[/quote]</p>
<p>Only 5. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>ISP is not IP. IPs may change for a given ISP, which is called a dynamic IP. You first brought up apples, but now you are countering with oranges.</p>

You could email <a href="mailto:support@jagex.com">support@jagex.com</a> and explain the situation to them, You may need to recover your own account though before the email can be changed. It takes them like a week to reply aswell.<br>

I wouldn’t recommend that. They would probably lock/ban the account because it seems like you either hacked, traded/bought the account which is against their rules.[/quote]</p>
<p>Whenever i have emailed them they have been very helpful. They will lock your account if you ask them too but unless you email them saying you think you are being recovered then they normally wouldn’t lock it.</p>
<p>They even unlocked my account when it became locked for no reason and would not recover using correct recoveries and from the same address the account was created from despite me having read several times on the forums Jagex cannot unlock accounts as they must be recovered.</p>

              <p>You could email <a href="mailto:support@jagex.com">support@jagex.com</a> and explain the situation to them, You may need to recover your own account though before the email can be changed. It takes them like a week to reply aswell.</p>

              <p>I recently got an account that has an email registered to it.</p>
<p>I want to change the email, but the only way I can find is by making it send an email to the email registered, which I do not have a password for. Is there any other way to change a email</p>
