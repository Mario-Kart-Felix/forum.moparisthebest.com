    <title>Run.bat error with silabs new jar, nooby yes. But help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/run-bat-error-with-silabs-new-jar-nooby-yes-but-help-please/164143</link>
    <description>Please do on flaming or spamming up the thread because I cannot do this self, I am intelligent when it comes to server coding how ever not when it comes jar files. 

When I downloaded silabs latest jar in the client 6 post within the server downloads section here I attempted to run it using this code,

[code]@echo off
JAVA  -Xmx500m -jar silabclient-168-50-413363112-18-67-95.jar 0 0 highmem members 0[/code]

Then after that didn&#39;t work out, I used this one which is basically the same thing.

[code]JAVA  -Xmx500m -jar silabclient-168-50-413363112-18-67-95.jar 0 0 highmem members 0
pause
[/code]

Each time I got the error below in the run.bat,

[code]c:\Documents and Setting\******* ****\Desktop&gt;JAVA  -Xmx500m -jar silabclient-168-50-413363112-18-67-95.jar 0 0 highmem members 0

c:\Documents and Settings\******* ****\Desktop&gt;pause
Press any key to continue. . . [/code]
Note: the *&#39;s are my name. Don&#39;t want people knowing it.

So, If anyone could help me with this it would be great fully appreciated.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 13, 2007, 05:28:33 AM[/size][hr]Bump, its been over a day.</description>
