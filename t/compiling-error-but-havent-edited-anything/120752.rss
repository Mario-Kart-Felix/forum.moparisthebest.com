<p>You steal peoples work, then distribute your pitiful understanding of those works, Ollie. So please just be quiet, I mean I know you, you’re sort’ve an “e-friend” but don’t be mis-informative.</p>
<p>Wrong, it’s not a hack… USE JODE to decompile! JAD wont be recompileable/runnable without some patching… Without renaming, there will be compiling collisions.</p>
