    <title>A Big mistake by MoparScape Staff!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-big-mistake-by-moparscape-staff/193076</link>
    <description>Recently i started a server and decided to add it to the status page.

I wasn&#39;t going to make a whole thing so i went to one of the pages on the page and edited it to use there layout, i edited it and added my server.

I look around and see alot of the server &#39;RUNEKEEP&#39; which was the base i used on there, i notice when i come back there all removed meaning hes got banned, and i try adding my server and im banned!

So i think status staff have looked at my layout and said, omg another one and banned me from using page, this is so depressing to me.

I belived i broke 0 rules no selling admins, no nothing like that just a page and it was banned!

BANNED SERVER:64.22.75.161

Please unban,
