    <title>$80 to spend...[Advice needed]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/80-to-spend-advice-needed/530705</link>
    <description>So I have an 80$ Best Buy certificate. I am wanting to purchase a couple of games ( preferably digital downloads but nor equired...) I have made a few points of the &quot;what I like&quot; type of things but you don&#39;t have to go by that either.

1)I am still somewhat new to hardcore gaming so I would like a game that will be good for the beginner/person who will advance later. 

2)I&#39;d really prefer a game I could use my keyboard+mouse over just the keyboard (wasd/arrows only) but again not really required.

3) I am considering maybe BF4 or COD Ghosts however my main issue with them is with my busy schedule I somehow don&#39;t see myself no lifing a shooter game neither.

4) I have come to like games such as DragonNest, Tera, Vindictus, AS3, Dishonored. If that helps any

5) I also like medieval games ( I know I played a trial game of something called War of Roses other day which was pretty cool but I think I can do better than that game!)

Other thoughts: I am trying to remember the name of it I know I saw it on here. It was like a cop type of game that was coming out that looked cool I know I had responded on? Also somebody mentioned ROME II or Guild Wars II to me but I don&#39;t know if either one of those is worth it ( Rome II is more than BF4  x.x...)

PC games I have

-Dishonored
-Crysis 3
-Crysis 2
-Witcher 2
-All the Need for Speeds

Xbox games I have

-GTA V</description>

<p>And well honestly…never was much of a fan of the game. I’d probably buy star war republic credits before I did wow. This can honestly be locked as I have decided to save the money to go towards the new ipad5</p>

              <p>Lololol World of Warcraft… It’s not that I don’t have the money which I do, it’s just I’m not a sucker who pays for a shit game to only have to pay for more shit. But my advice, give up and find something more productive to spend your or possibly your parents money on, and if you cannot do that then pay for a game that is actually worth paying for.</p>

<p>Yeah, there’s like two expanions with their own story lines. Knife Of Dunwall (you play as daud <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) and The Brigmore Witches[/quote]will look into those thanks for the info</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-s">So i think I am almost convinced to get either Max Payne, Batman Arkham Origins, or Battlefiled 4. There just doesn’t seem to be any newer games that are actually worth it yet out there.</span></p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>EDIT: after doing some more research I may actually change this up some. I am possibly looking at ordering</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GTA IV (I can get it dirt cheap and I want to make sure I like it before I buy the new one which will run me a pretty penny!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Batman Arkham Asylum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homefront( A friend suggested this from the gameplay it looks pretty cool!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning(very nice graphics from what I have been told with a nice plot twist? )</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All decently priced games…I am considering swapping out the last one with something like Police Force</p>
<p>So should I get one of the earlier games I was talking ( mp3, bf4) or just get a combo of these?</p>

<p>I wasn’t aware that there was an expansion for dishonored? Yeah I have been considering Elder Scrolls/Skyrim but I have access to that as well via a friend’s skype who has like three of them <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

              <p>So I have an 80$ Best Buy certificate. I am wanting to purchase a couple of games ( preferably digital downloads but nor equired…) I have made a few points of the “what I like” type of things but you don’t have to go by that either.</p>
<p>1)I am still somewhat new to hardcore gaming so I would like a game that will be good for the beginner/person who will advance later.</p>
<p>2)I’d really prefer a game I could use my keyboard+mouse over just the keyboard (wasd/arrows only) but again not really required.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>I am considering maybe BF4 or COD Ghosts however my main issue with them is with my busy schedule I somehow don’t see myself no lifing a shooter game neither.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have come to like games such as DragonNest, Tera, Vindictus, AS3, Dishonored. If that helps any</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also like medieval games ( I know I played a trial game of something called War of Roses other day which was pretty cool but I think I can do better than that game!)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Other thoughts: I am trying to remember the name of it I know I saw it on here. It was like a cop type of game that was coming out that looked cool I know I had responded on? Also somebody mentioned ROME II or Guild Wars II to me but I don’t know if either one of those is worth it ( Rome II is more than BF4  x.x…)</p>
<p>PC games I have</p>
<p>-Dishonored<br>
-Crysis 3<br>
-Crysis 2<br>
-Witcher 2<br>
-All the Need for Speeds</p>
<p>Xbox games I have</p>
<p>-GTA V</p>
