No, I’m cool with him being illiterate. However, if he wishes to talk about the United States like he lives in the country, I’d like for him to actually speak English. No one outside of this country actually knows what’s going on, unless they get their own reliable sources. You have to live through it to understand it, you can’t just speculate from another country without the same problems and know what you’re talking about.</p>

Its amazing how much people can bash some one for no reason. All i am asking is that you post some of your facts about what you believe?  This is a friendly debate , no need for the harsh comments, and i never said fox news is perfect i said they report  more accurate news then the rest (most of the time) now tell me what laws has the democrats tried to past that would stabilize are economy?<br>
what has the democratic party done for us in the last 10 years?<br>
hell what party supported slavery ?</p>
<p>Any thing and every thing just voice your opinion rather then bashing some one, and  being completely clueless cause obviously most you are when it comes to politics. You have bash me on and on and still have not attempted to make any point<br>
here’s a real good question what are the protesters on wall street  protesting?<br>
and who is funding them?<br>
please  be mature and  have a friendly debate no need  for childish actions thank you.</p>

<p>No, I’m cool with him being illiterate. However, if he wishes to talk about the United States like he lives in the country, I’d like for him to actually speak English. No one outside of this country actually knows what’s going on, unless they get their own reliable sources. You have to live through it to understand it, you can’t just speculate from another country without the same problems and know what you’re talking about.<br>

<p>Its amazing how much people can bash some one for no reason. All i am asking is that you post some of your facts about what you believe?  This is a friendly debate , no need for the harsh comments, and i never said fox news is perfect i said they report  more accurate news then the rest (most of the time) now tell me what laws has the democrats tried to past that would stabilize are economy?<br>
what has the democratic party done for us in the last 10 years?<br>
hell what party supported slavery ?</p>
<p>Any thing and every thing just voice your opinion rather then bashing some one, and  being completely clueless cause obviously most you are when it comes to politics. You have bash me on and on and still have not attempted to make any point<br>
here’s a real good question what are the protesters on wall street  protesting?<br>
and who is funding them?<br>
please  be mature and  have a friendly debate no need  for childish actions thank you.[/quote]The URL i linked to is fact.</p>
<p>Who were talking about the political parties? I believe that i’m quite friendly in this debate, your post makes no sense.</p>
<p>After analyzing your post my conclusion is that you hardly have any clue about this at all.</p>

<p>Thanks sir  i almost lost hope. The us government was never established  to borrow money rather to protect the freedom of all who lived in the states at the time. Over the course of that time we gave are  government more and more power. Today the governments power,  witch was suppose to be the peoples  vote  has went beyond there original purpose. They borrow and bail out to big two fail corps, and put are children’s children’s children’s in to debt. Any thing we do now will not be nearly enough to get are self’s out of debt. only real way is to eliminate big government and keep are original founding principles and go from there.  the  government should not have the power to spend my hard earned money  on anything they please.

(corps) sorry corporations.   Are troops safety should be number one. that’s a good point democrats rather fight for gay rights, abortions,global warming rather then spend money to save and aid the troops. most of us don’t have the guts to do the things they will do and done. yes are vote counts.   Its just hard to convince the world what vote is in there best interest.</p>

<p>What you said was great. democrats  will give you a fish (control how much you get ) wealth.<br>

I don’t need any one to do for me, ill do it on my own.<br>
when we move away from government, will be better off.</p>

<p>Well, I do not blame obama for everything, but I think there are others more qualified. He could have done better… I know he had it rough joining, but hey, whatchya gunna do. <a class="mention" href="../../u/andrew-2.html">@andrew</a> love the sig</p>

<p>He doesn’t have enough experience.  McCain should have been president simple because he knows how the system works.  Obama is too inexperienced, and doesn’t know how to get huge problems fixed without knowing how shit works.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t get why people blame the economy on Bush.  He went to war with fucking anger and rage, you would’ve done the same exact thing.  He lost around 1000+ American lives that he will never get back.  If i was the president at the time, I would’ve done much more.  Every American wanted to kill those terrorists, and now acting like hypocrites because they wanted to do the same fucking exact thing at the time.</p>
