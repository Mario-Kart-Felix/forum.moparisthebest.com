<p>Also, I don’t get why people blame the economy on Bush.  He went to war with fucking anger and rage, you would’ve done the same exact thing.  He lost around 1000+ American lives that he will never get back.  If i was the president at the time, I would’ve done much more.

<p>If anything, you should drop your horrible two-party system and have real Democracy as a opposed to this charade. Maybe then you can actually see some change in the country.</p>

<p>he wouldn’t have had to deal with the 9/11 tragedy if clinton would have did something about osama when he was given the chance… <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05" rel="nofollow noopener">http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05</a></p>
<p>if the us government keep printing money like its nothing and causing inflation then u are not making jack profit when u invest in the government. u would be better off having ur money in the bank or the stock market, b/c at least then u have a chance to make money. if u invest in the government, think how does the government get its money??? thats right by taxing its citizens. so essentially any profit you are making back was you money to begin with… then after u account for inflation you have actually lost money. so the statement of when u invest in the us government you are guaranteed profit is invalid.</p>
<p>i havent did the calculations but it sounds like it is true if u think about it. besides the government was never meant to be a bank and should never be one. but the current administration believes that they can use the us treasury as a bank. how is the citizens of a government do good and stay out of debt if the government itself doesnt know how to not be in debt?</p>
<p>how many us jobs have been lost to china and other foreign countries since clinton signed the bill lowering the barriers to foreign countries? Lots, the us is only 1/18th of the worlds population, so it only makes sense that business owners that their only goal is to maximize profit, to do as much business as they can at cheaper costs. which with the countries willing to work for fraction of what americans are willing to work for plus lower costs to trade between said countries is why lots of jobs have been lost to foreign competition.</p>
<p>there are 2 ways to combat this. place higher restrictions on trade to foreign countries, or outlaw labor unions. both options have potential to bring jobs back to america. restricting trade has obvious reasons. the second one u may think wtf would u want to do that. the answer is to lower the cost of living index. if u lower the cost of living then companies will start looking back at americans. u think labor unions are there to protect their members, true that was their purpose but unions have became too powerful and can raise wages when ever they so desire.</p>
<p>when u raise wages u raise the cost of living b/c products and service have to increase to accommodate for the rising costs in labor. the world economy has a set amount of currency value, every country may be able to print more money but the value can’t increase, its like matter. monetary value of items can be increased and decreased but the total value of monetary value can not be created or destroyed.</p>

Yeah dude because Bush has successfully eradicated terrorism!!!<br>

<p>he wouldn’t have had to deal with the 9/11 tragedy if clinton would have did something about osama when he was given the chance… <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05" rel="nofollow noopener">http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05</a></p>
<p>if the us government keep printing money like its nothing and causing inflation then u are not making jack profit when u invest in the government. u would be better off having ur money in the bank or the stock market, b/c at least then u have a chance to make money. if u invest in the government, think how does the government get its money??? thats right by taxing its citizens. so essentially any profit you are making back was you money to begin with… then after u account for inflation you have actually lost money. so the statement of when u invest in the us government you are guaranteed profit is invalid.</p>
<p>i havent did the calculations but it sounds like it is true if u think about it. besides the government was never meant to be a bank and should never be one. but the current administration believes that they can use the us treasury as a bank. how is the citizens of a government do good and stay out of debt if the government itself doesnt know how to not be in debt?</p>
<p>how many us jobs have been lost to china and other foreign countries since clinton signed the bill lowering the barriers to foreign countries? Lots, the us is only 1/18th of the worlds population, so it only makes sense that business owners that their only goal is to maximize profit, to do as much business as they can at cheaper costs. which with the countries willing to work for fraction of what americans are willing to work for plus lower costs to trade between said countries is why lots of jobs have been lost to foreign competition.</p>
<p>there are 2 ways to combat this. place higher restrictions on trade to foreign countries, or outlaw labor unions. both options have potential to bring jobs back to america. restricting trade has obvious reasons. the second one u may think wtf would u want to do that. the answer is to lower the cost of living index. if u lower the cost of living then companies will start looking back at americans. u think labor unions are there to protect their members, true that was their purpose but unions have became too powerful and can raise wages when ever they so desire.</p>
<p>when u raise wages u raise the cost of living b/c products and service have to increase to accommodate for the rising costs in labor. the world economy has a set amount of currency value, every country may be able to print more money but the value can’t increase, its like matter. monetary value of items can be increased and decreased but the total value of monetary value can not be created or destroyed.[/quote]</p>
<p>Bravo my friend you hit the hammer on the nail, Thats what i was looking for good job, I agree with you and ill add, If we take away some of the taxes we put on large  corporations they would surely  look are way</p>

<p>He doesn’t have enough experience.  McCain should have been president simple because he knows how the system works.  Obama is too inexperienced, and doesn’t know how to get huge problems fixed without knowing how shit works.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t get why people blame the economy on Bush.  He went to war with fucking anger and rage, you would’ve done the same exact thing.  He lost around 1000+ American lives that he will never get back.  If i was the president at the time, I would’ve done much more.  Every American wanted to kill those terrorists, and now acting like hypocrites because they wanted to do the same fucking exact thing at the time.<br>

<p>Obama would of waited what two three months before making a decision  to up are security and deploy are troops and that would of given us 2-3 months of looking over are shoulders hoping a plane wouldn’t come crashing down on are city.<br>

They don’t have the force to enslave 300 million people. They don’t have an organized military. They don’t even have the resources for more than 50 people to get across the ocean. It’s literally impossible (unless they threatened with nuclear warfare, in which case the world would be in trouble, not just us).</p>

<p>If bush hadn’t of done what he did. we would be converted to Islam. He made a decision to protect the united states of america and not give in to these  terrorists,  who would stop for nothing then to spill each and every one of are blood for there holy quran.   Bush is a true patriot, he  wasn’t the best president but hey he saved my life and yours.</p>

Just leave the topic. We wouldn’t have been converted to Islam, idiot. We have 300 million people living here, they aren’t going to enslave us like a bunch of mice.[/quote]</p>
<p>How many are christian’s and how many are muslim’s  in the states ?  this a very diverse country. Under the original Constitution, It  protects us from thing like this we have the right to religion.  Now with the majority rules and the further we go beyond the Constitution original purpose any thing is possible. if a uprising of unions and brain washing media comes along, we can become the next soviet union  and there isn’t nothing we could do about it. 300 million against 6.6 billion who at the moment hates are guts for the economic down fall  i say yea any thing is pretty dam possible especially with a weak  and  no experiences president who bows to the kings and blames his country for the poverty, the other nation face today.</p>

<p>I agree. Had Busch not brought the fight to the middle east, the terrorists would continue to make attacks on the US. Over time people would become fearful and convert. Not likely to happen but never the less, it could’ve.<br>

They don’t have the force to enslave 300 million people. They don’t have an organized military. They don’t even have the resources for more than 50 people to get across the ocean. It’s literally impossible (unless they threatened with nuclear warfare, in which case the world would be in trouble, not just us).[/quote]<br>
