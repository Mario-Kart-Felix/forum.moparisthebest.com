<p>Nothing wrong with watching fox or any other news as long as you dont base all your knowledge off them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>these are only my opinions. i disagree with you on fox twisting the news cnn and csnbs both  repoted on the tea party rally’s and try to stir up trouble with the party and claimed they wore being hostel towards them, when the video showed the the reporter being the  trouble maker, how many people at the tea party rally’s got arrested? 0<br>
how many on wall street got arrested? 345<br>
how do democrats stay in power ? by keeping the majority poor what party has the most government funds/ tax payer dollars democrats,  who supports unions meaning schools and such? democrats there for meaning they could teach us what they want us to believe  i was raised  believing republican are rich hungry monsters who want the poor to stay poor.<br>
that is not true they want independents, like my self i was raised on welfare 18 years of my life  a government check/tax payers dollars. i stole and what i didn’t have and blamed the government for making me trash.<br>
when i turn 18 i was thrown in to the streets were i  did drugs and became street wise.<br>
soon learned how to make big money went to prison for 2 years and read law books  the constitution  learned that democrats wore the ones for slavery. i  learned alot got out and didnt stop there met a girl and had 2 boys  worked security over night read founding fathers, how tax came about democrats again basically, its like this how  much do you really no? not very much if your going based on high school are even college educate your self.<br>
and  your comment on glen beck, he is one of the greatest man to walk this earth  you should listen to him not what bbc is reporting  there as  far left as it gets.</p>

Nothing wrong with watching fox or any other news as long as you dont base all your knowledge off them.<br>
[/quote]<br>
these are only my opinions. i disagree with you on fox twisting the news cnn and csnbs both  repoted on the tea party rally’s and try to stir up trouble with the party and claimed they wore being hostel towards them, when the video showed the the reporter being the  trouble maker, how many people at the tea party rally’s got arrested? 0<br>
how many on wall street got arrested? 345<br>
how do democrats stay in power ? by keeping the majority poor what party has the most government funds/ tax payer dollars democrats,  who supports unions meaning schools and such? democrats there for meaning they could teach us what they want us to believe  i was raised  believing republican are rich hungry monsters who want the poor to stay poor.<br>
that is not true they want independents, like my self i was raised on welfare 18 years of my life  a government check/tax payers dollars. i stole and what i didn’t have and blamed the government for making me trash.<br>
when i turn 18 i was thrown in to the streets were i  did drugs and became street wise.<br>
soon learned how to make big money went to prison for 2 years and read law books  the constitution  learned that democrats wore the ones for slavery. i  learned alot got out and didnt stop there met a girl and had 2 boys  worked security over night read founding fathers, how tax came about democrats again basically, its like this how  much do you really no? not very much if your going based on high school are even college educate your self.<br>
and  your comment on glen beck, he is one of the greatest man to walk this earth  you should listen to him not what bbc is reporting  there as  far left as it gets.</p>

I don’t respect any of your opinions because you’re seemingly illiterate. If you were a few years older, or knew how to speak English correctly (the official language of the country you are talking about), then maybe you’d have a right to opinions.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@eyeown</span> u do know that the united states doesn’t have an official language, just the majority of its citizens speak it.

<p>Nothing wrong with watching fox or any other news as long as you dont base all your knowledge off them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>these are only my opinions. i disagree with you on fox twisting the news cnn and csnbs both  repoted on the tea party rally’s and try to stir up trouble with the party and claimed they wore being hostel towards them, when the video showed the the reporter being the  trouble maker, how many people at the tea party rally’s got arrested? 0<br>
how many on wall street got arrested? 345<br>
how do democrats stay in power ? by keeping the majority poor what party has the most government funds/ tax payer dollars democrats,  who supports unions meaning schools and such? democrats there for meaning they could teach us what they want us to believe  i was raised  believing republican are rich hungry monsters who want the poor to stay poor.<br>
that is not true they want independents, like my self i was raised on welfare 18 years of my life  a government check/tax payers dollars. i stole and what i didn’t have and blamed the government for making me trash.<br>
when i turn 18 i was thrown in to the streets were i  did drugs and became street wise.<br>
soon learned how to make big money went to prison for 2 years and read law books  the constitution  learned that democrats wore the ones for slavery. i  learned alot got out and didnt stop there met a girl and had 2 boys  worked security over night read founding fathers, how tax came about democrats again basically, its like this how  much do you really no? not very much if your going based on high school are even college educate your self.<br>
and  your comment on glen beck, he is one of the greatest man to walk this earth  you should listen to him not what bbc is reporting  there as  far left as it gets.</p>

<p>I don’t respect any of your opinions because you’re seemingly illiterate. If you were a few years older, or knew how to speak English correctly (the official language of the country you are talking about), then maybe you’d have a right to opinions.<br>

so why are you mad? i’am only practicing the first amendment? don’t get mad throw me some facts defend your party and yes my grammar is very bad,  did i mention that  at birth i was told i was going to be mentally retarded and i was in special ed all threw  k middle and high school, oh and i won best creative story in the state in 11 grade. i agree with you sir but we are not here to debate about how illiterate i’am but to here  how others view this great nation.</p>
