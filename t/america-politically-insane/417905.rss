According to modern Islamic theology, the Qur’an is a revelation very specifically in Arabic, and so it should only be recited in the Arabic language. Translations into other languages are necessarily the work of humans and so, according to Muslims, no longer possess the uniquely sacred character of the Arabic original.

<p>Translation of the Qur’an has always been a problematic and difficult issue in Islamic theology. Since Muslims revere the Qur’an as miraculous and inimitable (i’jaz al-Qur’an), they argue that the Qur’anic text cannot be reproduced in another language or form.</p>

<p>Wrong. 1.8 Million people in the US are Islamic, according to the CIA World Factbook. That is to say, around 0.6%.</p>

<p>Clearly incorrect. I don’t have stats for this, but I do have a brain in between my ears.</p>

<p>All of the bombs, if they were set off at the same time, could be like a nuclear bomb world wide.</p>

</aside>
<p>A modern one kilogram nuclear weapon releases about the same amount of energy as 1.1 million tonnes of TNT. Assuming you could get all of these imaginary muslims in one place to set their bombs off at the same time (where are we putting 20% of the population at once? certainly no building or train station…), their bombs would have to contain about 0.5 tonnes of explosive, assuming the explosive they can make in their kitchen was as powerful as TNT.</p>
<p>And this all happens somehow without the rest of the USA noticing.</p>
<p>I suggest you stop watching Fox News, since it does take a certain degree of thought to figure out when they’re just bullshitting (pro tip: its 99% of the time)<br>
[/quote]<br>
Damn slayed.</p>
<p>I was making the percentages up.  But your second response is still false.  Not as much as 5% or even .1 but a small percentage of Islams know how to do it.  They’ve been trained that way.[/quote]<br>
Yes and I bet those Muslims have also been trained to be able to set bombs with the power of a nuclear bomb too</p>

<p>Wrong. 1.8 Million people in the US are Islamic, according to the CIA World Factbook. That is to say, around 0.6%.</p>

</aside>
<p>A modern one kilogram nuclear weapon releases about the same amount of energy as 1.1 million tonnes of TNT. Assuming you could get all of these imaginary muslims in one place to set their bombs off at the same time (where are we putting 20% of the population at once? certainly no building or train station…), their bombs would have to contain about 0.5 tonnes of explosive, assuming the explosive they can make in their kitchen was as powerful as TNT.</p>
<p>And this all happens somehow without the rest of the USA noticing.</p>
<p>I suggest you stop watching Fox News, since it does take a certain degree of thought to figure out when they’re just bullshitting (pro tip: its 99% of the time)[/quote]<br>
Damn slayed.</p>
<p>I was making the percentages up.  But your second response is still false.  Not as much as 5% or even .1 but a small percentage of Islams know how to do it.  They’ve been trained that way.</p>

What I don’t get is, why Islam attacked the twin towers when there were Christians and Jews in the towers. Christians and Jews are supposed to be brothers of the book but apparently, those radicals think,“I MUST DESTROY INFIDELS.” When in reality, they are the infidels.<br>

<p>The radicals can justify their actions just as much as the Christian crusades. If you step out of religion, you could look at how the Germans treated the Jews, or Whites treated Blacks, or even how men have treated women over the centuries. (inb4womanjoke)</p>
<p>It all comes down to superiority. We can justify being the world’s superpower because we consider ourselves, as Americans, to be superior in whatever ways we come up with. The Islamic extremists behind many acts of terror can propose a similar argument, they just have a lot less people backing them up. It’s more of arrogance than pride in my opinion.</p>

<p>What I don’t get is, why Islam attacked the twin towers when there were Christians and Jews in the towers. Christians and Jews are supposed to be brothers of the book but apparently, those radicals think,“I MUST DESTROY INFIDELS.” When in reality, they are the infidels.</p>

</aside>
<p>Lol they attacked because we openly support leaders that oppress them just for our benefits. But they also took that as an insult because they see us supporting Israel (Jewish state) and they take it as we hate islam. It’s also because we try and force our system onto other countries, and for them Islam in the government is a big deal, but we support separation of church and state.</p>

<p>If Bush couldn’t go to war, then we would have to follow their orders.  They don’t have enough resources for more than 50 people to get across the ocean, but then again they killed around 1000+ innocent people with just around 10 terrorists.  Think about it.  More than 20% of the U.S. population are Islamic, or Middle-Eastern.  And at least 5% of them know how to make bombs in their basement or their kitchen.  All of the bombs, if they were set off at the same time, could be like a nuclear bomb world wide.</p>

<p>Yeah dude because totally all muslims are terrorists and want to fucking kill your children with bombs and planes. Totally.</p>

<p>And you are an authority figure on segregating Islamic Americans and profiling them? Have you actually gone to a Mosque and talked to Muslim Americans about what they face, or how they are treated? Do you <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> know what you are talking about?</p>
<p>I don’t mean to be direct; I’m simply pointing out particular flaws which may void your argument. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

Well, my friend told me about this he lives in Canada and is Muslim.  He went on and on about all this… then again he lies like a bitch.  Then again I didn’t say the whole Islamic American community.  I may have been exaggerating a little bit, but a portion of the Islamic American community knows how to though.[/quote]<br>
Well I am muslim and I live in Egypt and I honestly don’t know how to make a bomb; perhaps they are misconducting our education, I will be sure to report this to the correct authorities as to rectify this flaw in our education system. I mean, we grow up without knowing how to make bombs… how horrible.</p>
