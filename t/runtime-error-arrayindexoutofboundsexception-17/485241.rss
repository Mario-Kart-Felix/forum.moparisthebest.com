    <title>Runtime error - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 17</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runtime-error-arrayindexoutofboundsexception-17/485241</link>
    <description>So my run stopped working, I was messing with the item.cfg files making them look nice, checking all stats (This source absolutely blows, poorly coded and sloppy, but it is helping me learn a lot for a beginner), and locating some null items that were placed into the server.

After messing around for a few days (kept my computer on frequently saving) I compiled what I had done and my run.exe now produces this error...

Now I figured that I put some accidental spaces instead of tabbing, so I checked and sure enough there was some spaces. Fixed until when I ctrl+f, put in (space) into the search box, there comes up 2 spaces for every 1 line (of course because the spaces for the &quot;item = x&quot;.

I have located most of the locations of the itemHandlers, but I have no idea where the error is coming up and why. If someone could guide me in the right direction, that would be great, thank you!</description>

              <p>Maybe you didn’t tab correctly. Go back into item.cfg and take a look at what you changed.</p>
