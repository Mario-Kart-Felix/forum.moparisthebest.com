    <title>MEPS Drug Testing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/meps-drug-testing/549385</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve recently decided that joining the military is something that I&#39;m interested in doing, and in doing so, one of the initial requirements is going to MEPS. I&#39;m kind of worried about the drug test portion, because I do have a history of cannabis use. It&#39;s been at least 2 months since my last use, and I have to say that I&#39;ve done it less than 10 times in total (probably around 6-7 at most), so I am definitely not a devout smoker or anything like that. I probably did all of them within a 3 week period of time, the last time being some time November. This information might help, but I&#39;ll provide it just in-case:

I&#39;m a pretty active person, mostly running several times a week, along with the gym.
My metabolism is pretty fast, I weigh ~120lbs, and my bf% is around 5-7%.
I drink a decent amount of water (at least 16 fl. oz. a day, sometimes more).

Basically, I was just wondering if someone has first hand experience with the MEPS drug test, or any information/comments you can provide me with would be great.

NOTE: I have already spoken to my recruiter and told him that I have no history of illegal drug use.</description>

<p>Also, there is one part with a 30-ish page questionnaire where you basically are told by your recruiter to answer NO for every question.

Have you ever been to the hospital?” and they act like it’s really serious, but pretty much everyone was just putting down “No” for everything.[/quote]<br>
Yes, this is VERY important. If you haven’t told your recruiter it, then they’re not going to know. They will threaten you, scare the shit out of you etc., they want you to break because they want to DQ everyone they think won’t make it.</p>

              <p>[quote=“PaulT, post:2, topic:549385”]Normally you would want to be open with your recruiter about things like that. My recruiter actually drug tested me himself to make sure I was clean. You definitely don’t want any trace of drugs in your system for MEPS, but after 2 months at the activity level described, you <em>should</em> be fine. You can buy a test kit, for probably around $15 or less from a drug store, and double check.</p>
<p>I didn’t end up going to basic or continuing in the process due to health reasons, but I did pass my drug test despite using cannabis (earlier than two months before the test). There’s going to be enough to worry about at MEPS without freaking out over the drug test, so screen yourself using an at-home test kit ahead of time, and then don’t worry about it.[/quote]<br>
Sorry to bother you again, but were you honest on your drug statements (about past use, etc.), or did you just say you have no history of it? I would think that as long as it isn’t detectable, it would better off to not admit to past use of any drugs. I drug tested myself for THC today, and the results were negative, so I BELIEVE I should be fine for the MEPS drug testing.</p>

I will be having to go down to MEPS eventually myself for the Marines and from my understand, they do only do urine tests unless they have a reason to any other form of test if I’m correct. From my understanding though, their form of tests is only by the urine so you should be fine.</p>
