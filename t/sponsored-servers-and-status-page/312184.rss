    <description>[b]NO THIS ISN&#39;T A FUCKING COMMENT ABOUT IT, JUST READ THE DAMN POST.[/B]

Ok, so this is what I sent to MITB, and I think some of you would agree. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know I had this conversation with you before, but couldn&#39;t find a good reason for you to even consider removing sponsored servers. Well, laying in bed last night, not being tired. I thought, hm, I should start a server again. 

Than, I said, hell with it, those damn sponsored servers will beat me out, and even if I was on top of the regular, I could get at most 55 - 70 players. 

In your words, not quantity, it&#39;s the quality. That should apply to more than a thread/post. Like a server. In this case. The quantity is money, and the quality is the server.

If some rich snob in Wisconsin, let&#39;s say. Gets 500 dollars from his dad. He spends it on getting his server, 1st on the status page. 

Well, the bad economy from my last argument applies now. Wow, wouldn&#39;t Mopar love have 500 bucks, for just simply getting this guy all of our servers players? No skin off your nose huh?

Well, than you think, well his servers not very good, it&#39;s a leech of off ______ and not very stable. So now we have a problem. We have us people working hard to get a good server, with [b]quality[/b] getting beat out by people with large [b]quantities[/b] of money. 

I&#39;m sure many others would agree. I&#39;m also considering starting a petition to remove these. Because your excuse to buy a great server someone has made, and having him sell it to you, hasn&#39;t fallen into plan yet. And it never will, believe me.

I hope you understand, and reply A.S.A.P because I won&#39;t be able to get on much in a few days.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like I stated in this message, maybe we should start a petition to get rid of these sponsored servers. You can&#39;t deny I made some pretty valid points in there.

<p>Obviously you have little experience in professional development. If someone is to be paid, say, $25 per hour for their work, then $5000 would be a mere 20 hours. Building a working server from the ground up takes a far longer time than 20 hours. Mopar is asking for someone to spend, as he said, hundreds to thousands of hours on this project. Chances are, whoever comes forward to claim the money will be barely paid minimum wage for their efforts. But then again, $5-$7 per hour is better than doing it for free.</p>

</aside>
<p>Sorry, but I just wanted to point out that the person would either have to work <span class="bbcode-b">200</span> hours or get paid <span class="bbcode-b">$250</span> an hour, if I’m reading your post correctly.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/chaospkers">@Chaospkers</a> and all: The argument here is that the members who are better financed will be advantageous in receiving a spot on the sponsored servers list. That is, without any doubt, true. But –</p>
<blockquote>We have us people working hard to get a good server, with quality getting beat out by people with large quantities of money.</blockquote>
<p>Chaospkers, you state that the members with more money are ‘beating’ the members who do not have that money but have a well programmed server. If you want to compete with the ‘rich snobs’, why not just popularize your server, receive donations, and get on that sponsored servers list? How do you think the other servers gained their spot up there? Sure, two or three of those may have been bought by members who are in fact financially able to without donations to their server, but the rest of the spots have been earned by the holder.</p>
<p>Next time you want to rant about inane situations such as this, please take time to think about what <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> and other members in your position can do to solve the situation.</p>

<p>What about it actually being over 100$ on average? Why start the bidding at $30? It seems as though the ONLY people that can advertise a server to make it bigger are people tha ALREADY have big servers… What about the small server that wants to get bigger. R-L has a $30 price, with a first come first serve basis, and they get more people. It’s not as if you need the money…</p>

<p>So now you don’t like the bidding system?  I don’t see how it could be more fair, you bid what you bid and the top 10 win.[/quote]<br>
i remeber when there were topics abouth woot! there is sponsered server and all that and now some people or aganist it…</p>

As Taharok said, I already own <a href="http://moparisthebest.org">moparisthebest.org</a>, and <a href="http://moparscape.com">moparscape.com</a> is not available, I sent an email inquiring about buying it from whoever owns it about a year ago, and still haven’t got a response.</p>
<p>Secondly, the reason you need to pay $5 to bid is because bidding was free the first 2 months, and people bid ridiculous amounts (like $500) and never paid.  The $5 bidding price guarantees that whoever bids is serious about it and has a paypal account, I don’t like it, but I see no other ways.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m sure someone will pay $5 and then just bid and not even pay… It’s still possible, just to get a few laughs out of it…[/quote]</p>
<p>But it hardly ever happens, usually 1 person doesn’t pay a month, where as before none of the top 10 paid.</p>

What about it actually being over 100$ on average? Why start the bidding at $30? It seems as though the ONLY people that can advertise a server to make it bigger are people tha ALREADY have big servers… What about the small server that wants to get bigger. R-L has a $30 price, with a first come first serve basis, and they get more people. It’s not as if you need the money…[/quote]</p>
<p>So now you don’t like the bidding system?  I don’t see how it could be more fair, you bid what you bid and the top 10 win.</p>

<p>Thanks for the wonderful logic.</p>
<p>You deserve a Nobel.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
I was reading everthing MITB said and decided I might try getting a sponsored server.</p>
<p>I was shocked when I went to bid:</p>
<p><img src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/4290/bidding.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>First off, you need to pay $5 JUST TO BID.</p>
<p>Secondly, that $100 each slot was incorrect, more like an average of $150 (and the bidding isn’t over!)</p>
<p>I was thinking that they might go up to $70 when I placed my bid, but I definitely give up…</p>
<p>ALSO: Most of those people have made one post: the thread to start their bidding.</p>

<p>Don’t assume you know how much he makes. If he makes enough to pay for the server monthly, then that’s how much he makes. He has no reason to hide anything from us, so don’t assume he is.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/davidi2">@Davidi2</a>: You don’t build a server overnight. I know several people who are working toward that $5,000. Making a server that doesn’t totally suck takes a lot of time and a sense that you actually know what you’re talking about. Like I’ve said to a lot of people in the past, just because you can’t see what’s going on behind the scenes, doesn’t mean nothing is going on.</p>
