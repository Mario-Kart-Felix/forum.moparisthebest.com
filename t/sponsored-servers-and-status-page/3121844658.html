        <p>Just FYI:</p>
<p>In the years <a href="http://mitb.com/">MITB.com</a> and <a href="http://mpsc.org/">MPSC.org</a> have been around, nothing has been bought by MITB with the money being given for donations/sponsored servers.</p>
<p>30$ (or more, IDK) * 10 = more then 300$ a month</p>
<p>This $30/server is being spent for less then a MB of space on the status page, and sits in MITB’s paypal account to be used for paying a developer. Now who says who this spectacular developer will EVER show up, but MITB has 10k in the bank for if he does. What a shame if these forums die, and all of that money can bee used freely, with no repercussions.</p>
<p>So I ask MITB: When will you tell us EXACTLY what you are looking for to pay people with? Or was saying all of that just to sugar coat it?</p>
<p>I agree one hundred percent with this, and will even sponsor a petition on my website if it is needed.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: 04 November 2009, 16:08:32[/size][hr][quote=“Newty, post:27, topic:312184”][quote author=ChaosPkers link=topic=408622.msg3017565#msg3017565 date=1257302164]</p>

<p>Some people don’t have better things to spend their money on, and if they <span class="bbcode-b">do</span> spend their money on it (investing) then they deserve a better return from their server then the people who don’t invest money into their server.[/quote]</p>
<p>Those people get their money from players, which isn’t even allowed.</p>
<p>MORE: It says specifically:</p>
<blockquote>1. You may not sell anything on your server for real world or real runescape money or items.  Such as items, levels, or mod or admin positions, membership, or anything else.</blockquote>
<p>And I checked. Most of them do. Amazing how the rules change when money is involved.</p>
<p>EVEN MORE!! - </p><blockquote>1. The cheapest you can buy a spot for is $30/month, but that is because unlike the other sites I guarantee there will be no more than 10 sponsored servers at any time, which means you get much more traffic because your server doesn’t blend in.</blockquote><br>
Bull shit.
<p>R-L currently has 2 on list.</p>

<p>Ok, so this is what I sent to MITB, and I think some of you would agree.</p>
<p>[quote]I know I had this conversation with you before, but couldn’t find a good reason for you to even consider removing sponsored servers. Well, laying in bed last night, not being tired. I thought, hm, I should start a server again.</p>
<p>Than, I said, hell with it, those damn sponsored servers will beat me out, and even if I was on top of the regular, I could get at most 55 - 70 players.</p>
<p>In your words, not quantity, it’s the quality. That should apply to more than a thread/post. Like a server. In this case. The quantity is money, and the quality is the server.</p>
<p>If some rich snob in Wisconsin, let’s say. Gets 500 dollars from his dad. He spends it on getting his server, 1st on the status page.</p>
<p>Well, the bad economy from my last argument applies now. Wow, wouldn’t Mopar love have 500 bucks, for just simply getting this guy all of our servers players? No skin off your nose huh?</p>
<p>Well, than you think, well his servers not very good, it’s a leech of off ______ and not very stable. So now we have a problem. We have us people working hard to get a good server, with <span class="bbcode-b">quality</span> getting beat out by people with large <span class="bbcode-b">quantities</span> of money.</p>
<p>I’m sure many others would agree. I’m also considering starting a petition to remove these. Because your excuse to buy a great server someone has made, and having him sell it to you, hasn’t fallen into plan yet. And it never will, believe me.</p>
<p>I hope you understand, and reply A.S.A.P because I won’t be able to get on much in a few days.[/quote]</p>
<p>Like I stated in this message, maybe we should start a petition to get rid of these sponsored servers. You can’t deny I made some pretty valid points in there.</p>
<p>:)[/quote]</p>
<p>Your entire argument is based on financial fairness. It doesn’t have anything to do with getting free money to pay to have a sponsored server. It’s about working your ass off to beat the servers up there, thus achieving a more popular server, and after some time, earning enough money to one day pay for it to be sponsored by this site.</p>
<p>And had it been an even bigger problem, I’m sure Moparisthebest wouldn’t have a very large problem doing a monthly ‘premium’ server or something like that. A few servers could qualify every month to get a free sponsored server position. The whole thing about that is none of the current servers could even match the qualifications. Nearly every current server is an absolute failure at performance. Only a few frameworks out there even work, yet people don’t use them.</p>
<p>So what can we do? If you want to be able to possibly qualify for a free sponsored server position (based on whether it would one day be implemented), then you must use proper software. If you are not intelligent enough to build an actual <span class="bbcode-i">good</span> server, then you need to wait for Moparisthebest’s sponsored server earnings to pay for someone who is.</p>
<p>Perhaps now you are starting to see the surface of the problem, and why Mopar’s sponsored server idea is one attempted solution.</p>

only rich noobs are able to get sponsored nowadays… annoying. even 100$ might not be enough…</p>
<p>ps. atleast server remove could be useful.<br>
[/quote]The remove option most likely won’t be added, unless it makes you wait another week before you can add the IP again.[/quote]</p>

<li>Remove your server (lets say IP is 40.30.20.10)</li>
<li>Change the No-IP to go to a different server (say 50.40.30.20)</li>

<span class="bbcode-b">NO THIS ISN’T A FUCKING COMMENT ABOUT IT, JUST READ THE DAMN POST.</span></p>
<p>Ok, so this is what I sent to MITB, and I think some of you would agree.</p>
<p>[quote]I know I had this conversation with you before, but couldn’t find a good reason for you to even consider removing sponsored servers. Well, laying in bed last night, not being tired. I thought, hm, I should start a server again.</p>
<p>Than, I said, hell with it, those damn sponsored servers will beat me out, and even if I was on top of the regular, I could get at most 55 - 70 players.</p>
<p>In your words, not quantity, it’s the quality. That should apply to more than a thread/post. Like a server. In this case. The quantity is money, and the quality is the server.</p>
<p>If some rich snob in Wisconsin, let’s say. Gets 500 dollars from his dad. He spends it on getting his server, 1st on the status page.</p>
<p>Well, the bad economy from my last argument applies now. Wow, wouldn’t Mopar love have 500 bucks, for just simply getting this guy all of our servers players? No skin off your nose huh?</p>
<p>Well, than you think, well his servers not very good, it’s a leech of off ______ and not very stable. So now we have a problem. We have us people working hard to get a good server, with <span class="bbcode-b">quality</span> getting beat out by people with large <span class="bbcode-b">quantities</span> of money.</p>
<p>I’m sure many others would agree. I’m also considering starting a petition to remove these. Because your excuse to buy a great server someone has made, and having him sell it to you, hasn’t fallen into plan yet. And it never will, believe me.</p>
<p>I hope you understand, and reply A.S.A.P because I won’t be able to get on much in a few days.[/quote]</p>
<p>Like I stated in this message, maybe we should start a petition to get rid of these sponsored servers. You can’t deny I made some pretty valid points in there.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Your entire argument is based on financial fairness. It doesn’t have anything to do with getting free money to pay to have a sponsored server. It’s about working your ass off to beat the servers up there, thus achieving a more popular server, and after some time, earning enough money to one day pay for it to be sponsored by this site.</p>
<p>And had it been an even bigger problem, I’m sure Moparisthebest wouldn’t have a very large problem doing a monthly ‘premium’ server or something like that. A few servers could qualify every month to get a free sponsored server position. The whole thing about that is none of the current servers could even match the qualifications. Nearly every current server is an absolute failure at performance. Only a few frameworks out there even work, yet people don’t use them.</p>
<p>So what can we do? If you want to be able to possibly qualify for a free sponsored server position (based on whether it would one day be implemented), then you must use proper software. If you are not intelligent enough to build an actual <span class="bbcode-i">good</span> server, then you need to wait for Moparisthebest’s sponsored server earnings to pay for someone who is.</p>
<p>Perhaps now you are starting to see the surface of the problem, and why Mopar’s sponsored server idea is one attempted solution.[/quote]Paying is working your ass off? Since when?</p>

If you could read, you would know that I am not keeping, spending, or otherwise using any of this money.  It is all going to pay the developer(s) of a very well coded server that will improve everyone’s experience from the host, to the developer, to the end user.  This money benefits everyone, and if you really want ‘quality over quantity’ then you should be all for it.

[/quote]<br>
Just a quick comment, the server(s) I saw in the sponsored servers section were not well programmed, and lacked quality over quantity.<br>
Not meant to be an argument, but just so I can try to get feedback.[/quote]</p>
<p>Of course not.  But I am not aware of anyone currently running any server that uses quality software, this is the whole point of the sponsored server money, to pay for quality software to be shared by all.  Hopefully after this happens, I can get rid of the ‘sponsored servers’ or even let people vote servers into a ‘sponsored position’ for free.</p>

[/quote] But what would the developers need $500 dollars for. They can do good stuff with only $100.[/quote]</p>
<p>But a good software developer is not going to program for hundreds or even thousands of hours for $100, I know I wouldn’t.  Currently I have slightly over $5000 saved up to pay the developer of a good server that meets my requirements.  Again, refer to the thread:<br>

<p>In the years <a href="http://mitb.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">MITB.com</a> and <a href="http://mpsc.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">MPSC.org</a> have been around, nothing has been bought by MITB with the money being given for donations/sponsored servers.</p>
<p>30$ (or more, IDK) * 10 = more then 300$ a month</p>
<p>This $30/server is being spent for less then a MB of space on the status page, and sits in MITB’s paypal account to be used for paying a developer. Now who says who this spectacular developer will EVER show up, but MITB has 10k in the bank for if he does. What a shame if these forums die, and all of that money can bee used freely, with no repercussions.</p>
<p>So I ask MITB: When will you tell us EXACTLY what you are looking for to pay people with? Or was saying all of that just to sugar coat it?</p>
<p>I agree one hundred percent with this, and will even sponsor a petition on my website if it is needed.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: 04 November 2009, 16:08:32[/size][hr][quote author=Newty link=topic=408622.msg3018213#msg3018213 date=1257375527]</p>

<p>EVEN MORE!! - [quote]1. The cheapest you can buy a spot for is $30/month, but that is because unlike the other sites I guarantee there will be no more than 10 sponsored servers at any time, which means you get much more traffic because your server doesn’t blend in.[/quote]<br>
Bull shit.</p>
<p>R-L currently has 2 on list.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t know what you are referring to by ‘in the years these websites have been around’.  I have NEVER accepted donations, and I only started this ‘sponsored server’ stuff in march 09 I believe.  I always try to be public with everything I am doing, as stated in my dev thread I currently have slightly over $5000 saved up for this, all from sponsored server sales.  I also don’t plan on closing the websites so I can use this money, that is just stupid, I have been here since January of 2006 and don’t plan on going anywhere.</p>
<p>As to your question, doesn’t that thread tell you EXACTLY what I am looking for to pay people with this money?</p>
<p>I am not, and have never attempted to scam anyone.  Don’t you think I could have taken donations all of these years?  Or even accepted money for people to ‘affiliate’ with me or advertise on the forums?  (I can’t even count the number of times I have been asked)  I also could make a LOT of money if I put more ads on here in different places, or pop ups, or pornographic advertisements.  If I was in this for the money I would have more than 1 google ad at the top and bottom of the forum, which pay for the hosting costs each month, with no measures to stop you from blocking them with adblock or anything else, and I am kind of insulted that you think otherwise of me.  Also there are countless forums that sell awards, status, or ‘donater’ ranks on forums, and I have never and will never do this because I hate those forums.</p>

        <p>I don’t remember mentioning donations at all in the sense you are talking about. I meant for Sponsored Servers, because those seem mostly like donations to me.</p>
<p>Personally I know that you will never close the site for the money, and am slightly embarrassed that you would think that’s what I implied.</p>
<p>Also haven’t there been servers that met all of your requirements to be bought?</p>

Again that's not what I meant by donations, but I think people would prefer that you use the money to remove the advertisements, rather then pay developers. (who would you pay $5,000, seriously) I don't thing anyone would object to using the money for the good of the forums, rather then the good of one (or a team) of individuals.
