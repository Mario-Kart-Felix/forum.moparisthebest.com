    <title>Downloading songs illegal - is it really?</title>

    <description>When an album is released, the author makes little or no money at all. The songs all goes towards the artist&#39;s concerts and such. So, should it really be illegal?</description>

My point is that when you download a song, and you are making your own Ferrari, the shop does not lose anything<br>

Not if you never would buy the product at all.<br>
Instead they can earn a paying customer, if you like the song you maybe buy more of the same group, if you like Ferrari you maybe buy someone later.</p>

<p>No it isn’t, they don’t lose anything. If I’d steal a cd from a shop it would be different, but music sharing doesn’t need something physical, and it can be copied. It’s the same as copying a book on your own paper, its not stealing, its copyright infrignement (sp?).</p>

<p>I guess it’s technically stealing, but when I download stuff they are losing NOTHING from it. I wouldn’t purchase the music in the first place, even if I had no way of downloading. So it’s not like they lose potential money from me buying it. I simply cannoy afford to listen to music if I had to pay. Plus I’m not breaking any laws here in my country by downloading music. So I guess by law, it is not stealing here.</p>

<p>Because I admit that when I download music I am commiting a crime, and I am jacking the artist and the label out of the money they deserve. You seem to think that you are being fair (in fact, that was your exact words).</p>
<p>I’m not calling you out, I’m asking how you have rationalised in your mind that what you do is right <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>basically its like, stealing a Ferrari, but then paying the creator back ^-^ rofl.[/quote]<br>
No, its like build your own Ferrari and pay the creator for the Idea of how build it.<br>
You have to self buy the materials when you copy a CD to a another CD, and when you are building your own Ferrari.</p>
<p>Download music is not legal, but also not STEALING.<br>
Download music is like breaking a patent.<br>
None of it is stealing but still not allowed.<br>
Stop comparing download Music and stealing something from a shop.<br>
Stealing is when you take something from a other person without permission.<br>
When you download with µTorrent/Lime-ware the seeder give you permission to download the file.<br>
Is more like Plagiarism.</p>

              <p>No, I fully understand the potential consequences of downloading music illegally. I pay them because I joined a group of people that do it. It’s not about slamming the record companies, I just felt it would be considerate to pay for the songs I download. I rather it be the group who created the music than the production companies. I know that it is wrong, no my moral compass isn’t screwed up.</p>

I don’t have to pay a cent, and that still isn’t fair. I give them what I think is the amount they get. Do I have to? No, I choose to.

yes, but say that (extreme scenario) 100 people buy the actual CD. and they all upload the songs, and everyone that would have bought the original CD, downloaded it from the people who uploaded it. The artist and cooperatives not not literally <span class="bbcode-i">lose</span> the money, but they don’t make anything from it. If you made a Ferrari from scratch its not like you actually bought the model and you’re giving it like that.</p>

You have staff, transport, the location costs money, you need equipment and the artists need money too.) The record company has staff costs, and most of them are on the stockmarket, so they have to make profits or else their share price will drop because of low dividends and then they can’t lend more money if they need to.</p>
<p>So yea, record company’s take a lot of the money, but they have more costs then musicians.[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree with this, but I also don’t want to pay 11.00 for a CD that I’ll listen to once a month. When I can wait 2 hours for my computer to download a torrent of the bands whole discography, for free(other than monthly fees for internet). When it comes down to it, stealing music is stealing. Whether it’s digital or walking into a store with a stolen CD in your pocket.</p>
