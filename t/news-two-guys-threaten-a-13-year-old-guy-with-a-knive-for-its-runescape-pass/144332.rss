    <description>[tt]September 17, 2007[/tt]

It&#39;s really happened, was on the news today here in Holland. Two guys (14 and 15 years old) threaten a 13 year old guy with a knive for its RuneScape password! :eek:

What today&#39;s RuneScape players aren&#39;t doing to gain free accounts :eek:, it&#39;s just horrible, I am pretty scared of it, even too scared to play RuneScape. Maybe the same thing happends to me! You&#39;ll never know...

Is there ever happened something like that earlier? Discuss about it :)
