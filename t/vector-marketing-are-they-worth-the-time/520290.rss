    <title>Vector Marketing - Are they worth the time?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vector-marketing-are-they-worth-the-time/520290</link>
    <description>So I got a letter in the mail. They&#39;re hiring student (People like myself) for full/part time jobs.
Base pay: $15.00
I was told they [b]are not[/b] telemarketing.
But I don&#39;t understand that because how do they make sales? (Also not a door-to-door company).
Are they legit? What do they do exactly? The site says &quot;We sell CUTCO® The World’s Finest Cutlery™&quot;.
This job doesn&#39;t seem that fun but from what the receptionist said it&#39;s fun to work there?

Does anyone know about this company?</description>

I don’t think you understand what those type of schemes are, because a company having horrible working conditions isn’t a pyramid scheme or a ponzi scheme. It’s just a company with bad working conditions, you don’t have to pay them money or anything<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote]pyramid scheme<br>
n.<br>
A fraudulent moneymaking scheme in which people are recruited to make payments to others above them in a hierarchy while expecting to receive payments from people recruited below them. Eventually the number of new recruits fails to sustain the payment structure, and the scheme collapses with most people losing the money they paid in.[/quote]</p>
<p>Who do you think is getting the other commission for any sales that do occur? The mangers who hired the person and than the other higher-ups.<br>
As we’ve established, it is a bad place to work because the majority of times you will not profit.</p>
<p>However, after looking at their website they now loan you the knives. This was not the case several years ago, so I suppose you are not losing the investment money.[/quote]A pyramid scheme implies recursiveness, from this it doesn’t sound like you can recruit other people just being a salesman. But you’re probably right about managers getting extra from who they recruit.</p>

It’s actually not a scam, lol. They aren’t asking for investments or anything, and cutco is a legit brand by vector marketing. We owned some of the knives before.</p>
<p>However, it not being a scam doesn’t mean you should go for it, OP. A quick Google made it sound like it’s extremely difficult work to sell expensive knives nowadays.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Well the way the operate is extremely shady and is a pyramid scheme. It is set up for the majority of people not to make money fail(which I would call a scam).You are right in the fact that you can make money, but lets be real…how many people are actually buying kitchen sets that are over $500? Family and friends? If I remember, the way they worked was you made $15 for giving a demonstration(once again, I’d imagine a small amount of people actually get to do this), and if you do make the sale you get 5% commission. They were pretty savvy to family/friends sales as well, so doing this wouldn’t necessarily work.</p>
<p>Once people realize they are wasting their time, they quit. But guess what, vector profited of selling the trial knife set and it is onto the next.[/quote]I don’t think you understand what those type of schemes are, because a company having horrible working conditions isn’t a pyramid scheme or a ponzi scheme.

We owned some of the knives before.</p>
<p>However, it not being a scam doesn’t mean you should go for it, OP. A quick Google made it sound like it’s extremely difficult work to sell expensive knives nowadays.</p>

<p>If you’re able to get a car, the delivery deal would be my suggestion as well. I averaged about $15/hour at a local place, and that’s on the low-end of what you can make delivering. They didn’t count my cash tips and so half of that was not taxed, either. You’d pay off any cheap car quick. Not to mention that pizza places are ALWAYS hiring.</p>

No car. So delivery = no go.<br>
I’ve tried Jack in the box, Mcdonalds, Subway, Burger King, Taco bell, KFC, and any other business in my area.</p>
