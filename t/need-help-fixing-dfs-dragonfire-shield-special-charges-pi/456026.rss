    <title>Need help fixing DFS (Dragonfire shield) special &amp; charges PI</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-fixing-dfs-dragonfire-shield-special-charges-pi/456026</link>
    <description>Ive been using an insidiax source that has dfs already added to the game and the charges are unlimited and once charged passed a certain point it is unlimited uses. Also, when I use the special it gives me ranged experience. Im not sure where to look in order to fix both of these so if anyone could give me some advice as to where to find it it would be appreciated. Insidiax/Trisidiax sources are compatible with project insanity. 
Thanks</description>
