    <title>Is there a website that you can create those funny black boarder pictures?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-a-website-that-you-can-create-those-funny-black-boarder-pictures/337205</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anyone knew of a website where you can submit a picture and it&#39;ll create those black boarder images where there&#39;s one word on the top, then a phrase at the bottom that describes the picture. I&#39;ve wondered this for a while. I&#39;m not sure what those type of pictures are actually called, if there&#39;s a specific name for it, but this is what I&#39;m talking about.
