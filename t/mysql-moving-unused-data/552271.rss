    <title>Mysql moving unused data</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mysql-moving-unused-data/552271</link>
    <description>I have a mysql table that fills up very quickly with data, After about 9 million entries I have noticed that my script that reads and write from the table starts to become sluggish. When I copied the table as history and truncated the working table the script was fine. This table holds both data that needs to be processed and data that is completed the data that needs to be processed has a transaction ID of 0 and the data that is already processed has a transaction ID &gt; 0. What I want to do is everyday at 12:30 first push all the contents that&#39;s completed into a history table and then only keep the unprocessed data. The data is only processed on the top of the hour but the table itself gets appended all the time during the day. What would be the best way of me doing such a database task?</description>

<p>Honestly this shouldn’t be in issue what type of Engine is the table because with the right indexing you really dont need to move data around. But i guess if you are using full text searching without solr or something similar i could see query issues.</p>
<p>If all else fails I would agree with the biebs.</p>
