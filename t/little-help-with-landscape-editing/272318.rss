    <description>ok first im using RSC community landscape editor that xEnt had released...what im trying to do is delete one little block so that i can add a ladder that goes downstairs (id 6) and have ppl actually see the ladder ive tried using the delete tile brush but all that does is turn it gray. i tried delete overlay which also didnt work...i tried putting black floor its literally what it says lol so was no help...anyways i was wondering if anyone knew how to delete one little block of area altogether?</description>

Have you tried going to the Edgeville dungeon one on the editor and copy and paste that tile to the location you want it? -_-;<br>

<p>You could try using T  X’s editor, as clicking a tile while show all it’s properties, then just mimic that where you want.</p>
<p>Be very wary using anything T  X has touched ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, i’ve seen T Xs editor <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Thanks, Jonesy.</p>

              <p>use the delete tile brush like you have, and then place a ladder there, 0,o? (you’d have to place the ladder through the server, I dont think the landscape editor has that)</p>

              <p>ok first im using RSC community landscape editor that xEnt had released…what im trying to do is delete one little block so that i can add a ladder that goes downstairs (id 6) and have ppl actually see the ladder ive tried using the delete tile brush but all that does is turn it gray. i tried delete overlay which also didnt work…i tried putting black floor its literally what it says lol so was no help…anyways i was wondering if anyone knew how to delete one little block of area altogether?</p>
