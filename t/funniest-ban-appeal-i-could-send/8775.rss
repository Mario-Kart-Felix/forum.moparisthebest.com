    <description>Ok well after downloading my autotalker I decied to spend a little time in Varrock World one advertising by saying this-

Go to this site- moparthebest.com for all the latest autoers


well know I am permently muted so I though why not send in an appeal with soem of the funniest reason that it wasn&#39;t me. 

NOW I HAVE JUST RELIZED THOUGH AFTER LETTING THAT AUTO TALKER RUN FOR AN HOUR I DIDN&#39;T EVEN GIVE THE CORRECT ADRESS TO THIS SITE!!I AM AN IDIOT HUH :mad:


(I will post what they send back to me later)</description>

They stole my password and autoed my account as a punishement for haxxoring them.

i was on Wow autoing but thats not against ur rules ok?<br>
then, the auto talked 2 me and went on runescape, it hacked my account and started mining and spamming by itself, i didnt know what 2 do, then, the mouse chased me down the street and all the noobs broke free into flag lane, they wer like animals…<br>
they ALL logged on my acount at the same time and all wrote with auto typers, then hitler came out of the drain and shot me in the head and i died and never wrote this message, so dont ban me, ban all non members and noobs and punch hitler for killing me, i cant type anymore coz i lost half my brain, yours sencerely, auto-cheating boberick2.</p>

              <p>hmmmmm just off the top of my head.</p>
<p>oh my gosh you wouldnt believe what happened. I tried to login today cause i was taking the day off school (more on that later) and i was banned. I was like omfg those penors. You see it all started yesterday. I was walking down the road to go to the net cafe to play a bit of WoW when these guys jump out and pull me into this bush by the river. I was like what are you guys doing let me go. They said “NEVER” and they repeadley (sp?) asked for my Runescape Pass. But i remembered those ads you play at the top of the game. And the ads told me to never give out my pass. So this went on for like 10 minutes me refusing to give them my pass. But then Oh my gosh. There was liek 3 of them and they started anal raping me. I held on for like 20 mins of repeated bum sex but i just coulndt hold in and i told them my pass. I cant believe i did it. I should have just taken the pounding. Well anyways so my ass was to sore to go to school today so i think, how about my game of runescape. and then this. And those guys stole my acc just to spam with. Weird huh, Well if you could please give back my Account i would be most grateful thank you.</p>
