    <title>I have alot of problems with it. Can anyone help me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-alot-of-problems-with-it-can-anyone-help-me/111086</link>
    <description>Ok let me explain my problems...

First of all, I can only play it if I start my own server... I cant log onto somone else&#39;s, it just says something like &quot;error, the server must be down, try pressing cancel and starting your own server&quot; and that even happens when I DO start my own server...

and some other problems... 

I cannot smelt any ores, when i click on the furnace nothing happens.. and at some doors, like the one in barbarian village with the spinning wheel in it, nothing happens there either. I just stand there doing nothing. and sometimes i cant drop stuff. AND... when i first started out i had a bronze pick.. but i mined 2 iron and my pick dissappeared! 

and also... sometimes, When i log onto the same account i&#39;ve been using, it reset&#39;s my whole account. meaning i have to start over and get the items again and whatever... 


also.. i&#39;ve heard people talking about &quot;editing mopar&quot; im new to it and all, you can edit your servers? how?  :confused: :|


-thanks for all help! ~mojo~  :cool:</description>

              <p>You need to get the latest version of java for that. Because of mining n stuff you have to edit your client.java, Check in the tutorial section for one</p>

              <p>I suggest playing some servers for a small amount of time.  Get to know their flaws and such, then you can think about creating a server/modifying a server.</p>
<p>I suggest you go to the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,50.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">RS2 Server Advertisement</a> section and look for some servers to join.</p>
