    <title>Is it possible to</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-possible-to/77963</link>
    <description>I&#39;m adding a lot of npc&#39;s to my server now, and i was wondering, is it possible to spawn them so they face a certain direction? All the npc&#39;s I spawn face south...and for npc&#39;s like a banker etc, I would rather have it so they face the bank window instead of starring at a wall.....

Anyone have any ideas? Or is this even possible? :confused:

erm...hello? Anyone?</description>
