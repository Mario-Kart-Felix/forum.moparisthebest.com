They come in, and ask Jack, “WHEN DOES OUR COFFEE BREAK START JACK IM THIRSTY AND WANT SOME FOOD.” Jack replies, “we can do it now, i guess.” With those words, a sweat of fear drips down my face.

</aside>
<p>She used her 99 mage power to summon the Jonas brother. I pulled out my 12 gauge.<br>
[/quote]Then I went to the Russian Mafia down on Wall street, and bargained with them to sell me some weapons. They agreed for a price. I had to come up with 7 million dollars, USD. By the time I gathered the money, 3 years have passed, and over 9000 lives have been destroyed due to my get-rich-quick scheme. I went back to the Russian Mob, and they did the trade. While I was make the trade, the CTU blasted through the door, and Jack Bauer came through in the front of the crowd. I managed to escape… …for now. 2 hours later, I am at a safe house and Jack Bauer kicks the door in. “FREEZE MOTHER FUCKER!” Jack yells, as he shoots my dog in the face, and my auntie in the leg. I am pinned in the corner of the room, begging Jack to let me go. “Shut your face, you ISLAMIC SCUM,” Jack shouts at me. After that, 3 more agents come in, shooting my dog again, assuring it was dead. They come in, and ask Jack, “WHEN DOES OUR COFFEE BREAK START JACK IM THIRSTY AND WANT SOME FOOD.” Jack replies, “we can do it now, i guess.” With those words, a sweat of fear drips down my face. Jack points his solid-black 50 caliber desert eagle in my face and says, “toodaloo, mother fucker.” He pulls the trigger.</p>

</aside>
<p>Just as he pulls the trigger, I wake up from a horrible nightmare.  I see my X-Girlfriend undressing across the road, I stare and see her kissing bob saget.</p>

</aside>
<p>but then i realize that if i die in my mind, i cannot live anymore. therefore, i remain in the same spot, laying brain-dead.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s when I found out I made a mistake in my logic and had to run through the process again…I did not die…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But then my computer tower next to me explodes from the CPU overload from my hardcoded piece of silab i call a RuneScape Private Server, and the shratnel from the metal Dell computer case lands in my eye, my leg, and in my chest. The piece that lands in my chest causes severe bleeding, and I bleed out within minutes.</p>

</aside>
<p>Then, I Wake up from another horrible nightmare, I am stuck inside a bubble that CANNOT be penetrated by sharp or deadly objects…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then I get a 15 kill streak and set off an EMP and ur fucking computers go off</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then The FBI breaks down the bubble and stops the EMP, and then…You wake up in the year 3003</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then the machines hack into my head, such as they did during the movie The Matrix. They get the mainframe codes for the Zion, and they destroy the crew and me.</p>
<p>/thread[/quote]I wake up and find its all a dream. I look out of my window and I find iPods ruling the world.</p>
