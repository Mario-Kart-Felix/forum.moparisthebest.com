    <description>Hey guys
I hope this is the right section.

Im looking for someone who is dedicated loves private servers and is willing to help me get one underway
at the moment i have a windows xp 2008 VPS.
i have minimal Coding experience but i am studying it now.
i know how to put servers online and know my way around clients/sources ect.

How ever i DONT have A client or source at the moment.
things that you need to be able to do

-Code Java Script
-Make Jar Files
-Setting up Web Clients.
-Access To Skype as we always need to be talking.
-A little bit about Phbb Forums. I am setting one up now but you will also need to learn your way around it.
-Advertising

What will you benefit out of your time and dedication?

-As we get bigger and better i will start to split the profit between the staff and people who help out to show my respect to you.

I am not looking at running a Shit rsps i want it to be the best. no money spared. 
at least running the server for 12 months. but hoping to run it for alot longer then that.

Add me on skype if you are keen: [b]Keegan.Levien[/b]
Dont add me if your a little 14 year old kid who thinks it will be COOL to do this as i want to be the best at what i do not COOL.

Last Year of school this year
Been around private servers for about 6 years
i Build my own computers for myself and others no i am not Chinese.

Cheers guys
