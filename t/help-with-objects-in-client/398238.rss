    <title>Help with objects in client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-objects-in-client/398238</link>
    <description>Im a new coder and have looked everywhere on how to solve this and just cant find anything that works. All of my regular trees (object id= 1276) that are already placed are skulls and im trying to figure out how to change them back to regular tree. Any help? Im using a 317 source and client if that helps any. Heres also a picture of what im dealing with. I can just delete them and add different trees but it makes it lagg when i open the client.

<p>The ID that was put in was most likely wrong, please check what ID it  is by typing ingame ::object or looking on the object list <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>When i first downloaded the client it was like that when i ran the client. On other clients it shows trees like normal. I just want it to run on this client because when i run on other clients the character is all f’ed up. I thought it would have something to do with custom objects that were added to the client but i checked them and there weren’t any custom object int in the class. Would it might me a model that was added?</p>
