    <description>need help with blocking npcs from attacking players through walls. using rscd based source i just need a path check for npc&#39;s but i cant find it in other sources could someone point out what i have to do to figure out and eliminate this issue or help with code snipps or something. i just need to see what the issue looks like and know where to add it i dont know how the source checks for walls. the pathgenerator.java is set in place to carry out paths and i got stuff like ranged through walls fixed but NPC is different they keep walking through walls when they go to attack players. There is nothing there to say if there is a wall or object dont go through it. 

help would be greatly appreciated</description>
