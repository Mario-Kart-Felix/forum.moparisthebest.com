    <title>Does anyone else realize?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-else-realize/286955</link>
    <description>Okay, so I&#39;m thinking right now that all of moparscape has no creativity whatsoever. It&#39;s safe to say that since &#39;08 summer, no one has changed the feel to an average server source. You&#39;re all spamming npcs to make training so incredibly convenient that it&#39;s not even an accomplishment. You&#39;re allowing users to have access to rares like they&#39;re candy on halloween (you&#39;re giving them out basically). And you&#39;re completely abolishing the concept of achieving anything all together. You&#39;re homes have no thought to them, you have 35 shops in one place, and Allstars hammer is still 9999999 strength. 

With the exception that my last source release was Reapagescape V2 in [b]JULY OF &#39;08[/b] mind you, I was only starting off. It was literally my first week into coding and had no clue what essentials were needed. But in the end, I did establish a fun and creative server. When I look at the downloads section, I see the same source. I&#39;d like to understand that you&#39;re all only starting out like I did, but if you notice the titles... They&#39;re V4s and V5s. By then you should get the point. 

I suppose this is just one way of venting, but more importantly a way to get moparscape on track. I know a lot of you probably didn&#39;t read half of this post, but I&#39;m challenging all of you to thrive to greater expectations. Why don&#39;t I do anything you ask? Because I&#39;ve been gone for like 3 months. So, if you get what I&#39;m saying, try your hardest to not to anything that I&#39;ve recognized in the past years worth of downloads. It&#39;s just repetitive and dissapointing. You could call me a hypocrite, but that wouldn&#39;t be helping anything.

Voice your opinions as well, I&#39;m sure there are some of you that see the same.</description>

Well, there could be a “official Moparscape server”. A few people should (if possible) work at it, and it should run for a while. That way, I guess everyone here will check it/play it some time.<br>
After a certain amount of time (no clue how long), release the server and ANYONE here will use it.</p>

After a certain amount of time (no clue how long), release the server and ANYONE here will use it.</p>
<p>That’s what happened with Delta.</p>

See, I knew there were some out there that aren’t totally oblivious to the repetitive garbage in the DL section.<br>

Yeah, we existed, but the only problem is, the download section is overloaded by DeltaScape leeches. I know Back to Basic is a deltascape based, but, I’m changing it a lot.[quote author=`Rich link=topic=379492.msg2854317#msg2854317 date=1246738986]<br>
This has always been a problem, and most of the time people think they’re adding ‘creative’ ideas but they just aren’t realistic enough, and look completely retarded.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes, like who ever tried making that zombie server, it look pretty stupid only because, they held the gun in a really stupid position, and no one really knows how to make our own emotions, which makes it look worse.[/quote]</p>
<p>What was wrong with my Zombie-scape server atleast it was original unlike most of the other bullshit. And it was the best position I could find</p>

<p>The main reason I said that was because what people would do is hard code everything into the framework instead of using the extensible part (like making plugins). So what I mean is to have some way to control what people do with the framework.</p>

Sure most people come here originally to leech, but some of them stay to learn, which is the entire point.</p>
<p>I think everyone realizes this, most private servers I see are the exact same as winterlove’s original release in 2005 except that instead of a 20 line switch statement it has turned into a 3000 line switch statement and it’s buggier than ever, also as stated above many great ‘frameworks’ have been created but have no content and therefore will never be used.  Anyone have any suggestions on fixing the problem?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Add the content before releasing. And maybe release binaries instead of open source. Also provide a way to extend the servers functionality, such as plugins.[/quote]</p>
