    <description>Alright well I kinda wanted to like make my own model, And I made it and stuff.. but I was wondering, how do I recolour it IN METASEQ?

Like, Galkon does it, Silence does it, everyone does it lol, but I just can&#39;t figure out what to do.

I did one thing, but it only showed it recoloured in the render.

Any suggestions?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 05, 2008, 03:26:29 pm[/size][hr]...Anyone?</description>
