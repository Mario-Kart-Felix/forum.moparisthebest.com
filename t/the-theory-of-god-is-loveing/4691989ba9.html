</aside>
<p>like lostmyphat said God can break logic.</p>
<p>about the being at 2 or more places at one time. parallel universes?</p>
<p>To prove God doesn’t exist one first would have to be God… simply put they would need to be on God’s level. How can you dis/prove something when you have no means of testing. No man made tool or system of measurement or mathematics can be used to experiment with the supernatural.</p>
<p>People need to stop using science to stay ignorant… Tbh people that hold all scientific theories and everything as if it is fact are no better than people who are religious.</p>
<p>OT: I think its when people say they are open-minded but do or say things that contradict that.</p>
<p>To an extent I can but I don’t believe it entirely.</p>
<p>The story behind The Halo series is more believable than Scientology(which I just see as a troll to all other religions).<br>

Evidence for Indiana’s failed education system ^.[/quote]</p>
<p>what are you saying? a lot of stuff was mentioned in that quote. are you talking about all of it or parts or it? I already know Indiana’s education system is fail. The whole united states education system is fail. I could go off an a tangent about all the things that fail in America and how they could be fixed. The education system is just one that needs major attention. sure its been getting new things done to it but it has remained generally the same for quite some time without any Major change to the fundamentals. Anything that was put in place over 100 years again needs to be updated to be relevant to today. Computers and the machines we have today weren’t even a thought in anyone’s head over a hundred years again not even the greatest minds simply because the technologies or founding technologies weren’t there then.</p>
<p>I say do away with college and combine secondary and primary education together more an accelerated version. I know the US is able to handle that. 24 years of school starting at the age of 5 is too much wasted time and money. There is proof in child prodigies… There is nothing special with them genetically it all has to do with their environment therefore anyone has that same potential if they have the environment to achieve that.</p>
<p>Cole how is it a cop-out that a being that created existence can break the very rules he wrote? That’s like saying a programmer is bound to the programming he wrote so it is impossible for him to bypass the very program he created… What non-believers don’t understand is God isn’t like what you make him out to be. I’m not trying to convert anyone I’m just wanting to people to think and stop listening and following others. God isn’t like Zeus or any other mythical gods. He can’t die and he has always existed(which why can’t that not be acceptable? Science cannot try to hypothesize before the “Big Bang” because they can’t even prove the “Big Bang” right down to the very moment it began so how is that any different that believing God was always and is always. Do you believe that infinity exists)</p>
<p>You guys can not comprehend God therefore that is why you don’t believe. You believe that everything that exist right now; why you and I are here right now is all by chance. Please crunch the numbers for me and let me know, based on the theories we base our existence on that we now exist? It is far more believable to believe in a greater being then to believe this all happened by chance. I don’t claim to be open-minded but I try to hear all points.</p>

<p>Using that logic you could ‘dispute’ everything that was ever done in science. That’s why you can’t use that logic. Well, the size of an apple is a ‘theory’; we have things that back up the size of an apple, but I guess that doesn’t count?? The reason people refer to widely accepted theories is because they’re <span class="bbcode-b">widely accepted</span> because they have <span class="bbcode-b">scientific backing</span>.</p>
<p>If you chose not to believe in that scientific backing for some reason, you’re the ignorant one.[/quote]</p>
<p>So all the Scientist that lead the scientific community forward past the beliefs of the majority were ignorant? ex. Ferdinand Magellan, Galileo, Darwin, and others. If I recall science exists because people weren’t satisfied with the common beliefs therefore set out to create their own understanding. If someone does conform to the majorities belief doesn’t make them ignorant, it just means they don’t like that answer and are seeking a better one.</p>

<p>Can you provide any evidence that would prove the invalidity of that belief? Why have a belief that can be proven wrong? Oh like the “Big bang” Theory and other widely accepted theories?</p>
<p>On the contrary it is the same exact something. We and existence are God’s creation as a program is a programmers creation. A creator of anything has the right to modify anything of their creation. Since God created existence then he created logic and the laws of physics so he is perfectly able to modify them in anyway he sees fit. just as a programmer can modify his code.</p>
<p>“unless your god somehow modifies logic itself, there’s no way that he can just “bypass it” simply “because he is”.”</p>
<p>exactly my point. You can comprehend this.</p>
<p>I haven’t been raised in church for 15+ either have I? They don’t really talk about this in church. I haven’t been to church in 2 years b/c I am just as lost as you are. I have lost my way trying to make my own destiny and write my own story. I don’t feel worthy there. not b/c of the people but b/c of my own judgement on myself. I just see people compare the God of the Bible to demi-gods of other beliefs as if he is only slightly more powerful that us and that he has a weakness or flaw.</p>
<p>Like Zeus have a father who he killed and Zeus is able to kill other gods if they disobey him and the Greek gods only control the earth. Like once again People simply don’t believe b/c they simply cannot comprehend God based on what we know about or on isolated existence… They are closed-minded when it comes to the possibility that the possibility of an all mighty being that can do anything he desires with no limitation created existence instead of everything happening by chance,</p>
<p>Well when you get the chance to ask him you can. I believe that things in the Bible were written to protect us from ourselves and may not be the whole truth.</p>
<p>yes because something coming from nothing and then that something started forming objects then those objects started to create the laws of physics and all this other crap lead to the earth and the earth just happened to be in the sun’s habitability zone and just happened to have water form on it; and just happened that one celled organisms started to exist and then it just happened that these cells formed together to make multi-celled organisms, when just happened to to keep forming together to make fish, and then land formed on the earth and plant life began to grow in it and adapted to using the resources in the soil to live; then those fish were like If I don’t start living on that I will surely be extinct, so some fish evolved to have legs… blah blah blah and you know all the other bullshit so now here we are not discovering that that is how it all began… all of that sounds so much more logical that some great being was bored and decided to create something to make him not bored.</p>
<p>Believing in a greater being isn’t an easy and comforting route. its actually a torturous, and treacherous route. Yes logic that keeps changing because it has flaws, but isn’t able to change b/c everyone that believes in it, are too afraid of disownment if they were to challenge the established beliefs.</p>

        <blockquote>Why have a belief that can be proven wrong? Oh like the "Big bang" Theory and other widely accepted theories?</blockquote>
the way youre complaining about "theories" makes it seem as if you think that a theory is just an "idea". its much more than that.
and if my belief is proven wrong, why should i give a shit? it doesn't determine my character, how i act towards others, or how i will be remembered when i die. its just my belief. it's not a moral code that tells me to bury a homosexual up to his neck in sand and throw rocks at him until he dies, or if a woman is raped that the rapist should pay the father some coins and marry her.
<p>also, im much more comforted by a belief that things were created by natural causes, and that i should value my life seeing as it’s only a fraction of a moment in the grand scheme of time, rather than the idea that, regardless of my actions, ethics, morals, etc. i will get rewarded with eternal life simply for believing that god sacrificed himself to himself to save me from himself.</p>

        <p>It is not close-minded to have disbelief in God, quite the opposite, it would make you open minded to alternative beliefs. The only thing that is close-minded is being 100% dead-set on any belief. I use evidence to lean on a belief and nothing more. That is why I don’t try to disprove god or the flying spaghetti monster, they are both have the same amount of evidence (none). The big bang has evidence, the theory of evolution has compelling evidence, but I accept they could be wrong however I do lean on them.</p>
<p>The bible isn’t evidence, it was written by men who claim it’s god’s word. We are to just belive what they say, which is hard when men are so corrupt. A theory has testable evidence and you don’t need to take anyones word</p>
<p>I’ve brought this up before, there are over 700 established religions which can be broken down to 3200 sects. Our local indigneous people worship multiple deities and have done so for thousands of years. They are just as right as anyone else. But by doing so, they are going to HELL because they don’t accept jesus. But wait, if you accept jesus, than the indigenous are sending you to a hell-like place, since you don’t worship their same gods.</p>
<p>Thats why its incredibly retarded to be dead set on one belief. “Science” for lack of better word, is always open to change infact it yearns for it.</p>

</aside>
<p>well, the biological process of evolution can definitely be “proven”, we can observe the biological process of evolution occurring, if you think the “theory of evolution” cannot be proven then you display a gross misunderstanding of what a scientific theory is, as evident by your later statement about the bible</p>

<p>It depends on one’s definition of evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>it does not, the bible is not evidence, the bible is the claim that is being made as to gods existence and the stories in the bible are also claims being made and are not evidence of anything</p>
<p>take for example the story of noah’s ark, it would be physically impossible to carry 2 of each animal onto a boat with the specifications in the bible, not only would it be physically impossible to carry those animals, even if you could carry all those animals it should be evident to anyone with even a basic scientific knowledge that those animals could not breed with each other past 2 generations or so</p>
<p>but assuming the animals could breed, and this is the 3rd assumption which is bad scientific form, but assuming the animals could breed past a few generations without crippling deformities we can prove it didn’t occur because we know for a fact that certain animal populations came from certain continents because they have localised traits and markers in their DNA which is different from the same species of animals from different geological locations, however assuming for the sake of the argument that noah’s animals could breed, we would know for a fact that all the current animals in the world came from two original pairs of animals but THIS IS NOT THE CASE</p>
<p>but forgetting all of that for a second, the final nail in the coffin is there is absolutely no supporting evidence that a worldwide flood occurred in any period of time</p>
<p>so, looking at this scientifically,</p>
<p>the premise of noah’s story is false, two of every animal species could not physically fit on an ark of that size<br>
the details of the story are false, two animals could not breed to produce the amount of animals we have in each species today and assuming that did happen we would be able to trace that back to the original two animals which we have been unable to do<br>
and finally the last detail of the story that the earth flooded is so utterly ridiculous it’s unbelievable how people can look at that and say “the bible is evidence of god!!”</p>

<p>the christian god, the god of the bible, who is accredited with such feats as flooding the earth, has been debunked and disproven for centuries to the point where christians have now adopted something that cannot be proven nor disproven but they still act as they once did by insisting that this entity exists and that it’s true and that they believe in it</p>
<p>I like religion, some nutter makes up a god and some smarter nutter disproves it, said nutter rethinks their god and gives them a newer power until a smarter nutter disproves it until you end up with something so far removed that you may as well be talking about a flying pink dragon which is invisible that no scientific tool can detect for all the credibility you hold</p>

<p>it isn’t acceptable because of the connotations it’s used in</p>
