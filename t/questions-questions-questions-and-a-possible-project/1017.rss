    <description>[glow=red,2,300]Question 1.)[/glow] 

People trying to log into my server have either &quot;Invalid login request&quot;, &quot;Your account is already logged in&quot;, or &quot;please use a different world&quot;. Any way to fix this? I&#39;ve tried everything, and as you people know I&#39;m just learning Java so I probably messed up somewhere.

[glow=red,2,300]Question 2.)[/glow] 

I am running HSV2.0B (HybridScape 2.0) and when I tried to add Castlewars to it, their is part of the code missing that I need to put the Castle Wars code after, so I do not have any idea where to put it. Any ideas? 

And now......bum......bum..........bum.............BUM!....The Project Idea!

[u][b]Project UltiRune[/b][/u]
Would it be possible.....if we had all the OBJECTIDs, to make new towns? 
If that is possible, then I am wondering if we could make somesorta program using Java (like a map editor) so that people could simply type in an objectID and click were they wanted it? Also, new quests? Could these be written? These things could all SPICE up a private server. Well, anyways, if this cannot be done, don&#39;t call me a noob please. Just thought of it last night. So...also...if it could be done...don&#39;t go starting right away, we will need to figure stuff out. And, as I mentioned above, I could not do much of the coding. :( But I am learning  :D. 

Sincerly,

AkRiAm
