[size=15pt][b]Introduction to ServerSoft[/size]

ServerSoft is a fast-growing Private-Server community of the [b]508 Division[/b]. We have different bases throughout different areas, including on the internet. We have teams that help make this community fast growing as it is, and well respected. We are recruiting experienced members of programming as well as RuneScape. Why don&#39;t you check out the next few chapters to learn more about this opportunity and the rewards that may follow.

[hr][sup]ServerSoft was first created in January of 2007. We were small then. Three years later we&#39;ve put are skills to the max and we&#39;ve become three in one.[/sup]


[size=15pt][b]Positions and Titles[/size]

There&#39;s a variety of Task Positions and Titles that you can choose from that best fits your description. Each position has a certain task or asignment of it&#39;s own and will pay upon it&#39;s difficulty. View the list below for a list of positions you can choose from and a description that best fits it&#39;s title:


[ol][li]Jr. Server Programmer [i]- Someone who helps program files for the server that has little or no prior experience.[/i][/li]
[li]Sr. Server Programmer [i]- Someone who helps program advanced files for the server that has enough experience to fullfil his or her duty.[/i][/li]
[li]Client Programmer [i] - Develop the Client by adding or editing the cache, editing source code, and adding additional files for further updates.[/i][/li]
[li]Bug Reporter [i]- Report ALL Bugs noticable or seen, to appropriate authority. This requires glitch or hacking experience.[/i][/li]
[li]Article Writer [i]- Write News Articles on our Website about new updates or changes to the server, with pictures included.[/i][/li]
[li]Web Designer [i]- Design code such as PHP, or HTML for editing and modifying websites or forums. *Must have prior experience.[/i][/li][/ol]


Take your time viewing the titles listed above. It may take you awhile to decide which title to stick with. Here&#39;s a little [b][i]reminder[/b]: For each title you choose to work with, you can also get promoted on that title to a higher rank! So there won&#39;t be any need having two titles, or quitting one title to switch over to the other. This will make the process much more easier. After you select your appropriate title, you might need to learn some information about [b]Development Teams[/b].

[hr][sup]Each position will have it&#39;s own pay. You will get payed for working for us, through [i]Gift Cards, Ultimate Game Cards,[/i] or[i] RuneScape Cards.[/i][/sup]


[size=15pt][b]Development Teams[/size]

With all Title Positions put together, they form the [i]Development Team[/i]. We use these developments together to form [b]ServerSoft[/b]. Once you have your selected title, and have had it confirmed with ServerSoft for you to be a Valid SSDT Member, you will have to register for a Server Account. The Account will be of Administrator status, most will often be hidden Admin. You will have FREE Commands and full server benefits.

<p>What’s the longest delay I can have until the topic gets closed? My main computer with the filing system doesn’t have internet but the pictures are all on there. I’m using a Laptop, and have no way of transferring the pictures from one computer to the other…</p>

<p>I plan to use my own. I’ve created and constructed a base of my own with almost all packets set up, except a few with stream methods that are off. I did this because I don’t want this server to gain the reputation of “Leecher” for shit that can’t even be prooven. I sent you a PM.</p>

<p>[size=15pt][b]Introduction to ServerSoft[/size]</p>
<p>ServerSoft is a fast-growing Private-Server community of the <span class="bbcode-b">508 Division</span>. We have different bases throughout different areas, including on the internet. We have teams that help make this community fast growing as it is, and well respected. We are recruiting experienced members of programming as well as RuneScape. Why don’t you check out the next few chapters to learn more about this opportunity and the rewards that may follow.</p>
<p>[hr][sup]ServerSoft was first created in January of 2007. We were small then. Three years later we’ve put are skills to the max and we’ve become three in one.[/sup]</p>
<p>[size=15pt][b]Positions and Titles[/size]</p>
<p>There’s a variety of Task Positions and Titles that you can choose from that best fits your description. Each position has a certain task or asignment of it’s own and will pay upon it’s difficulty. View the list below for a list of positions you can choose from and a description that best fits it’s title:</p>
<p>[ol][li]Jr. Server Programmer <span class="bbcode-i">- Someone who helps program files for the server that has little or no prior experience.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]Sr. Server Programmer <span class="bbcode-i">- Someone who helps program advanced files for the server that has enough experience to fullfil his or her duty.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]Client Programmer <span class="bbcode-i"> - Develop the Client by adding or editing the cache, editing source code, and adding additional files for further updates.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]Bug Reporter <span class="bbcode-i">- Report ALL Bugs noticable or seen, to appropriate authority. This requires glitch or hacking experience.</span>[/li]<br>

<p>Take your time viewing the titles listed above. It may take you awhile to decide which title to stick with. Here’s a little <span class="bbcode-b">[i]reminder</span>: For each title you choose to work with, you can also get promoted on that title to a higher rank! So there won’t be any need having two titles, or quitting one title to switch over to the other. This will make the process much more easier. After you select your appropriate title, you might need to learn some information about <span class="bbcode-b">Development Teams</span>.</p>
<p>[hr][sup]Each position will have it’s own pay. You will get payed for working for us, through <span class="bbcode-i">Gift Cards, Ultimate Game Cards,</span> or<span class="bbcode-i"> RuneScape Cards.</span>[/sup]</p>
<p>[size=15pt][b]Development Teams[/size]</p>
<p>With all Title Positions put together, they form the <span class="bbcode-i">Development Team</span>. We use these developments together to form <span class="bbcode-b">ServerSoft</span>. Once you have your selected title, and have had it confirmed with ServerSoft for you to be a Valid SSDT Member, you will have to register for a Server Account. The Account will be of Administrator status, most will often be hidden Admin. You will have FREE Commands and full server benefits. You will also be e-mail monthly a FREE Giftcard, Ultimate Game card, or RuneScape card for your services with ServerSoft. We ask of that when you register to become a member that you use true, valid Identity Credentials otherwise you will be banned from registering.</p>
