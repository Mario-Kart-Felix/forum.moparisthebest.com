    <title>RuneReverse Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runereverse-client/431608</link>
    <description>Ok, Here is my problem, after the server and Client loads, it gets to the PLAY NOW screen, in the message part of the screen it keeps spamming, all I was able to read was GO somewhere and do something. 

I got to &quot;RuneReverse - Anti Leech Fix&quot; Topic on www.xtracode.smfnew.com, I was told to go into client.java: find Message2 then command it out and also the crappy code, someone esle said or delete it. Thats ok, but do I just do that to the Message2 line only or any other line also??

Could someone help me fix this problem, by putting a picture up showing what needs to be done, or good step-by-step instructions because I dont know how to do the programing, so I would not be able to tell what code is good or not. thanks</description>
