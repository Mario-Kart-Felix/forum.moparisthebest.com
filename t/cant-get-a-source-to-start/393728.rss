    <title>Can&#39;t get a source to start</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-get-a-source-to-start/393728</link>
    <description>Hey what&#39;s up everyone,

I&#39;ve just downloaded the Hybrid PvP source and client to try to start coding a bit. However when I open it I can&#39;t seem to get to even play on it. I was hoping someone could explain it to me because I THINK I need to make like my own server before using the Source? I don&#39;t know any help would be highly appriciated, because once I can get on it I&#39;ll just watch little tutorials per piece i&#39;m going to code ;).

Thanks allready.</description>

u go to ur C:\Program Files\Java there should be a folder that say jdk and the version u have if u dont download it from <a href="http://java.com" rel="nofollow noopener">java.com</a> i recommend jdk1.6.0_21 after u download it open ur source folder find ur compile and ur run.bat then all u do is edit it once u open the edit of the file u will c that it say jdk1.6.0_ &lt;--  and the number will be different it or the same if it different change it to the 1 u have i hope u understand what i mean if not i can find a tutorial for u on youtube</p>
