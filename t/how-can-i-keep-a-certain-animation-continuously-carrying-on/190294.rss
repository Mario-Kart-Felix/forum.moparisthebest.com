    <title>How can I keep a certain animation continuously carrying on?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-keep-a-certain-animation-continuously-carrying-on/190294</link>
    <description>Title says all.

For example I want [code]stillgfx(277, absY, absX);[/code]

To continuously loop through?</description>

              <p>Youâ€™d want to put it in the process() function. That would make it work every 500 ms, so you may wish to add some sort of timer to it - eg:</p>
<p>Add a new variable to the client class:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int animationtimer;</code></pre>
<p>Then in process():</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">animationtimer++;
if(animationtimer = 5)
{
 animationtimer = 0;
 stillgfx(277, absY, absX);
}</code></pre>
<p>Would roughly make it run every 10 seconds.</p>
