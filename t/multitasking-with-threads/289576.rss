    <title>Multitasking with threads</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multitasking-with-threads/289576</link>
    <description>im trying to make a program that does a few separate tasks simultaneously using threads but i&#39;ve never used them before so i tried making this sample program that prints numbers....

[code]
public class SampleThreads implements Runnable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
	    new Thread( new SampleThreads() ).start();
    }
    public void run() {
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; 20; i++) {
	    System.out.print(i+&quot;, &quot;);
	}
	System.out.println();
    }
}
[/code]
This returns:
&lt;blockquote&gt;1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6, 7, 2, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 1, 9, 4, 8, 3, 4, 9, 5, 10, 2, 3, 11, 6,
 10, 5, 11, 7, 12, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 8, 12, 6, 13, 9, 15, 13, 16, 10, 14, 7, 15,
 16, 11, 12, 17, 14, 18, 13, 17, 8, 18, 14, 19, 15,
15, 16, 9, 19,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
17, 18, 19,
16, 17, 18, 19,&lt;/blockquote&gt;
or something similar each time. this IS what I want it to do because the threads are going away and doing their own thing.


however in my final program i want it to execute code within a different method, not the main method. so i tried doing this:
[code]
public class SampleThreads implements Runnable {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
	    new Thread( new SampleThreads().spec() ).start();
    }

    public void run() {
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; 20; i++) {
	    System.out.print(i+&quot;, &quot;);
	}
	System.out.println();
    }

    String spec() {
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; 20; i++) {
	    System.out.print(i+&quot;, &quot;);
	}
	System.out.println();
    return &quot;&quot;;
    }

}
[/code]
this returned:
&lt;blockquote&gt;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,&lt;/blockquote&gt;
which is not what i want because the threads are simply executing one after the other....

please help. thank you!</description>

<p>You forgot to implement the [tt]run()[/tt] method <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>That’s a modified version, but try running it and see what happens.</p>
<p>Note that I synchronized 2 methods in Checker. In case you ever want to modify the ‘from’ and ‘to’ fields when Checker is executing, it shouldn’t modify them until it has no use for them anymore. That way you can’t modify them while Checker is comparing local variable [tt]i[/tt] with [tt]from[/tt]. This would cause problems if you tried to do that without it being synchronized.</p>

Don’t Implement the Interface Runnable for multi-threading, instead do as Follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int max_threads_count = 20;
int limit = 15;

public static void main(String[] argV){
 for(int a = 0 ; a &lt; max_threads_count ; a++){
  new Thread(new Runnable(){
   public void run(){
     for(int b = 0; b &lt; limit ; b++){
      System.out.println(""+b);
}
}}).start();

  }

<p>Because you’re starting 5 threads and each one’s job is to outprint the same thing as all of them, but since threads work simultaneously you need to synchronize whatever you want done.[/quote]</p>
<p>yeah but that’s what i want it to do (i think). i want the threads to go away and work simultaneosly, but for some reason whenever i try to do it using a specific method it just starts the threads one after the other (ie, when one finishes, the next starts).</p>
<p>your method appears to do the same thing as my first code, which is what i want it to do but i don’t want to use the run method.</p>
<p>anyway. i did this,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class SampleThreads implements Runnable {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
	    (new Thread( new spec() )).start();
    }

    public void run() {
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; 20; i++) {
	    System.out.print(i+", ");
	}
	System.out.println();
    }
    private static class spec implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; 20; i++) {
	    System.out.print(i+", ");
	}
	System.out.println();
        }
    }

}</code></pre>
<p>that works nicely and gives an output looking like this</p>
<blockquote>1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4,

however now there is the problem of not being able to pass variables into the new thread which is vital in my program.
<p>i want to just do something like this, obviously it wont work though:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    public static void main(String[] args) {

<p>Because you’re starting 5 threads and each one’s job is to outprint the same thing as all of them, but since threads work simultaneously you need to synchronize whatever you want done.</p>
<p><code>public class SampleThreads implements Runnable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
	    new Thread( new SampleThreads() ).start();
    }
    public void run() {
        synchronized (this) {
	    for (int i = 1; i &lt; 20; i++) {
	        System.out.print(i+", ");
	    }
	    System.out.println();
        }

or something similar each time. this IS what I want it to do because the threads are going away and doing their own thing.
<p>however in my final program i want it to execute code within a different method, not the main method. so i tried doing this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class SampleThreads implements Runnable {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
	    new Thread( new SampleThreads().spec() ).start();
    }

    public void run() {
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; 20; i++) {
	    System.out.print(i+", ");
	}
	System.out.println();
    }

    String spec() {
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; 20; i++) {
	    System.out.print(i+", ");
	}
	System.out.println();
    return "";
    }

}</code></pre>
<p>this returned:</p>
<blockquote>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,

which is not what i want because the threads are simply executing one after the other....
<p>please help. thank you!</p>
