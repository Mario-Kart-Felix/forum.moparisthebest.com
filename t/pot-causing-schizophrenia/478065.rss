    <description>Does it? I&#39;ve heard that it does, but I think that diseases such as schizophrenia and testicular cancer (Also linked to pot) are in genes. So if you don&#39;t have the genes matching schizophrenia and testicular cancer, then does that mean smoking is okay?</description>

Why exactly would they waste their time coming after me? The thought is ridiculous. They have much bigger things to do then come after small time recreational users when they could be busting growers.</p>

              <p>[quote=“jme, post:3, topic:478065”]I don’t think there’s any credible evidence to suggest cannabis alone will cause schizophrenia but it still shouldn’t be ruled out. Its widely accepted that it could make pre-existing mental problems worse. Some people seem destined to get schizophrenia later in their life. You could be one of those people without knowing it, and cannabis use may quicken the onset more rapidly. This seems to be true with most drugs though, including alcohol.</p>
<p>If you smoke a lot of weed and are diagnosed with schizophrenia, your doctor won’t even blame it on the weed. He will tell you it was probably inevitable.</p>
<p>It’s a mental disorder, and we don’t understand as much about them as we’d like to. However it does have real physical effects, including too much dopamine receptor activity. With anti-psychotic meds this activity will be reduced usually fixing the problem as long as you take the meds.</p>
<p>Smoking it is okay for millions of people, but others would disagree. It’s not something I suggest you start, success and money will give you a better high than pot ever will.[/quote]<br>
Doesn’t get any truer than this.</p>
<p>If you don’t try it, you wont miss it. Its nice but its not amazing.</p>

<p>my question now is that when I smoke again will I get nervous?[/quote]</p>
<p>Your high is usually based off your mindset. So if you are worried about getting caught, then you will most likely get paranoid. What i do, is I try my best to keep my grades up, and stay active, and I don’t do it often. So that if I do get caught(again), I’ll have some leverage. Just be careful, don’t get careless with it, like walk into walmart with a joint on your ear. I had a friend that did that, and he was arrested. It’s hard to tell someone not to have a paranoid high, controlling your highs comes with experience. For instance when I smoke, if I feel a bad trip coming, I usually don’t smoke. I will wait for a day or so, and then try toking up. Your first few times, I recommend you never smoke at your own house, I recommend that for as much as you can, especially if your parents are strict on it. Whenever I smoke at my house it’s about 1:00 at night, and it’s down by the creek. Your high will be so much better if you find a place where you can smoke. My friend lives with his dad, his dad is okay with it, we can come over, get drunk and high, but any mess we make, we clean up, and we buy him dinner/breakfast for it. Always remember, don’t do it at school, before school, you WILL get caught. And, never, never, bring it to school. I made that mistake when I first started, and I was suspended for 10 days, and all of my teachers know it. Luckily, it was my freshman year, and the principal said he would give me a break, so it will not stay on my permanent record.</p>

<p>By now I’ve balanced both. Not everyone can. And if you like it as much as me, gl doing that.</p>
<p>If you don’t even start it in the first place, you’ll be focused better on the important things in life. But nothing you or I say will stop him. So it’s best to focus on harm reduction and not propaganda.</p>

              <p>I don’t think there’s any credible evidence to suggest cannabis alone will cause schizophrenia but it still shouldn’t be ruled out. Its widely accepted that it could make pre-existing mental problems worse. Some people seem destined to get schizophrenia later in their life. You could be one of those people without knowing it, and cannabis use may quicken the onset more rapidly. This seems to be true with most drugs though, including alcohol.</p>
<p>If you smoke a lot of weed and are diagnosed with schizophrenia, your doctor won’t even blame it on the weed. He will tell you it was probably inevitable.</p>
<p>It’s a mental disorder, and we don’t understand as much about them as we’d like to. However it does have real physical effects, including too much dopamine receptor activity. With anti-psychotic meds this activity will be reduced usually fixing the problem as long as you take the meds.</p>
<p>Smoking it is okay for millions of people, but others would disagree. It’s not something I suggest you start, success and money will give you a better high than pot ever will.</p>

              <p>I don’t know where you heard about the testicular cancer thing but… Marijuana causing Schizophrenia symptoms is a very real, very rare thing. It’s a strong psychoactive drug, and like any others, it can cause the effects of Schizophrenia to be more apparent, if you already have it. I’m not sure or not if it can alone CAUSE Schizophrenia, but it can make the symptoms stronger.</p>

              <p>Does it? I’ve heard that it does, but I think that diseases such as schizophrenia and testicular cancer (Also linked to pot) are in genes. So if you don’t have the genes matching schizophrenia and testicular cancer, then does that mean smoking is okay?</p>
