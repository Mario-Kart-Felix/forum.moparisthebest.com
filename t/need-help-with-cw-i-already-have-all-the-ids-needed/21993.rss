    <title>Need help with CW--I ALREADY HAVE ALL THE IDS NEEDED!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-cw-i-already-have-all-the-ids-needed/21993</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;m trying to build fully functional CW. No, I&#39;m not gonna say &quot;Can someone write it for me then mail me it thxz&quot;. I have found all the ID&#39;s for the stands, the standards, and the standard stands. 

All I need is a sample of code that:

Changes one object into another object based on if you choose an option of the first object
Creates an object based on if you unequip an item
Deletes an object based on an option of that object.

First people who get me a sample of code that can do that will get VIP status on my server, with the
ability to use its fully-functional CW resources whenever they want

I am using Project 16 edit 7, and I am also using the original HybridScape source, if that makes a difference please respond accordingly

Thank you in advance :)</description>
