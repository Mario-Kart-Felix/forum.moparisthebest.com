    <title>Java Isn&#39;t Recognized As An Internal or External Command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-isnt-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/340826</link>
    <description>[size=18pt]Ok, so this is my first guide on how to fix Java errors. I know alot of people know how to do this but then again many people don&#39;t. So here goes[/size].  ;D

          Now, if you&#39;re Command Prompt is giving you the error of [code]&#39;java&#39; isn&#39;t recongnized as an internal or external command, opperable program or batch file.[/code] Then you might not have the latest Java, JDK, and jre that you need. Currently on Thursday, May 20th, 2010 the latest JDK is 6u20. Once you have this downloaded check if it works again. If not follow these steps:

     -Go into your computer C:\ drive and go to &quot;Program Files&quot;, open it then click on &quot;Java&quot; go to the one that says JDK 6u20 or your version.

     -Open it then go to &quot;bin&quot;, and up at the top it should say somthing like &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20&quot; copy this!!!

     -Now if you&#39;re on Windows XP do this, go to &quot;Computer&quot; once opened right-click on the white area, go all the way down to the bottom and click on &quot;Properties&quot;, then go to &quot;Advanced Settings&quot;, and then &quot;Enviroment Variables&quot; There are two places that have Variables in them, in the top if there is no CLASSPATH and Path to be found click new and paste the &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20&quot; do it for both. Now in the bottem box, find the same, CLASSPATH and Path and put the same thing in them.
    
      -Now if your using Windows Vista do this, go to &quot;Computer&quot; once opened right-click on the white area, go all the way down to them bottom and click &quot;Properties&quot;, then go to &quot;Advanced Settings&quot; on the top left side, and then &quot;Enviroment Variables&quot; There are two places that have Variables in them, in the top if there is no CLASSPATH and Path to be found click new and paste the &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20&quot; do it for both. Now in the bottem box, find the same, CLASSPATH and Path and put the same thing in them.


                                                                                              Hope this helps lots, Alex.</description>
