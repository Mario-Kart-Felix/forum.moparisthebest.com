              <p><code>If FindColorTolerance(x, y, COLORHERE, 1, 1, 516, 338, 5) Then
Begin
 Mouse(x, y, 3, 3, true);
End;</code></p>
<p>If the color is found within the given dimensions(1, 1, 516, 338), the coordinates would be returned in x and y. This procedure also allows a tolerance when finding the color, which in the example above would be a tolerance of 5. Experiment with that.</p>
<p>You can also use FindColorSpiralTolerance with the same parameters. The difference is that the script would start looking for the color at the current coordinates of x and y and then spiral out. This way, before you use that procedure, you could give x and y coordinates of a place on the screen that the monster is usually close to. Therefore eliminating some of the similar colors in a different spot.</p>
<p>Hope this helped,</p>
