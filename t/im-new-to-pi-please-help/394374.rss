    <description>I might get flamed for this but please dont. This is more of an advice thing then helping on 1 certain thing.
I&#39;ve always wanted to run my own server since wild got taken out of rs and replaced with bh cause thats when i switched to rsps.

bout 2 months ago i started coding the origional deltascape source and i feel like ive feeled alot from what i knew what i starte (which was basicly nothing) and most of what ive leaved is from the tutorials and help yall have put out n i used. but players on my server been complaining bout glitches in the delta source so my co advised i switch to [pi] and learn to code it. I&#39;v now got a good [pi] source that i like alot and a good client to run it. and ive noticed when i try to to code it using what ive learned from coding delta i just get lost and confused. (and ill admit that)
*i know im probley gonna get replies saying if you dont know how to code then i dont nee to be running my own server but i been wanting to do this for while and im trying to learn so i want to anyways*

okay first question: i dont know if is because it is just different from delta sources or if the [pi] source i got isnt good but some reason when you go in bin there is a run, compiler, &amp; character folder. But also when i go to data it has all 3 again and so my source folder has 3 compilers, 3 runs, and 2 character filer. IS IT SUPOSE TO BE LIKE THAT?

second question: in my delta source a made a great custom skiller zone but i wanted to know if to remake on [pi] i nee to go into client.java and search and do the whole globalobject. thing again like in delta? If thats not can somebody please tell when id need to do to move + make object like banks and skilling objects please?

third question: can some body please give me tutorial link or tell me how to set up pk point system + pk shop?

Last: I was doing good coding delta but switching to [pi] is like completly restarting and relearning so any valuable info or tutorial or help your want to tell me about coding [pi] PLEASE DO SOO(:

If you tell me somthing i&#39;ve alry figured out im not gonna complain or begg for different info. ill mostly just say i have already figured that part out but thank you very much for your help(:

p.s: people who help with my server alot can deffient be rewarded on the server if they deside to join. but if not then please dont just ignore that i still need help even if your not joining..

THANK YOU! (:</description>

<p>-also just relized i need to know if i can use same ::pure code from my delta and add it to my [pi]? and if soo where do i add commands?(even though ill probley find were to edit and add commands by the time i get a reply[/quote]</p>
<p>you can use <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a> for a lot of pi commands like master and pure. or you can learn to convert it. ( I have a wonderful suggestions command that I converted :D)</p>
<p>you can find command documentation at src-server-model-players-packets-commands.java</p>

same concept as this and I made a point shop guide in a reply to that topic<br>
4.personally, i find pi a lot easier than delta but everyone else disagrees. I like how the files are set up. One protip I will give you : do not clutter client.java</li>
