    <description>Here are [size=18pt]Some Eye-Catching Things to do in [u]YOUR[/u] Topic Thread![/size]

[size=14pt]Some tips and tricks.[/size]

[ul][li]Start off with a good title, you can also consider this to be done later.[/li]
[list]
[li]I like to make the title simple. The server name - Server Logo | Recent update/Motivational new message everyday like me and Evelus do (We kinda stopped hehe).[/li]
[li]Do NOT make it like:
&lt;blockquote&gt;WANT A SEXY FUN RSPS???? I AM HERE TO SHOW U ONE!! FRE ITEMS COOL EIGHT???&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Is this professional at all?
[/list]
[li]Do [b]NOT[/b] make your thread so gibbered that it looks bad with pictures on it.[/li]
[list]
[li]Don&#39;t make it like:[/li]
[list]
[li]&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=15pt]SERVER NAME[/size] 

[size=18pt]text[/size] 
text
[size=14pt]TEXT!!![/size] some more text aw ma God!!
[size=24pt]link[/size]
client download link: hi
things about server: revision
-Bunch of random stuff in the server
OWNERNAME is owner
[size=36pt]PLAY NOW &lt;3[/size]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
^ That will destroy a viewers mood completely.
[/list]
[/list]
[li]Make an update log! Without an update log, there is no hype in the server! No enthusiasm! You don&#39;t want that, do you?[/li]
[list]
[li]I know what you&#39;re thinking. &quot;Lol, update log on advertisement thread.&quot; But it&#39;s a very useful tool and due the advertisement thread being seen more than a development thread, it&#39;d be ideal to keep your users motivated.[/li]
[li]Only make an update log on the thread you are sure you will update the most, not when you are advertising on a forum you are non-native to.[/li]
[list]
[li]Prety sure this is unclear, so let me make an example.[/li]
[list]
[li]I am known in let&#39;s say Rune-Server. I go to moparscape and sythe (or however it&#39;s spelt :P) and advertise there. Now I think, if I put an update log, will I update on all the thread. Your answer is most likely no. So, the the strategy is that you only put the update log in rune-server and link the people to your update log.[/li]
[/list]
[li]Or, you can make a blog and post every update there. Link your users there![/li]
[/list]
[/list]
[li]One of the most worst strategies is to say you are having open staff spots. [b]DO NOT SAY THAT![/b] If you do, you will attract immature people staff hunting, and believe me, that&#39;s never good.[/li]
[list]
[li]These types of people will leave your server like trash.[/li]
[li]Another strategy is that people say free donator and/or free items. Do never do this either, it just will attract hungry people looking for gold.[/li]
[/list]
[li]Please, do [b]NOT[/b], do [b]NOT[/b], do [b]NOT[/b], use another threads pictures. It is just plain bad.[/li]
[li]Proper grammar. Period.[/li]
[list]
[li]A typo is fine, but a sentence like:[/li]
[list]
[li]&lt;blockquote&gt;plz come Staff member will be Good Treat you weLL becuZ we liKez you soo much dud!&lt;/blockquote&gt;[/li]
[/list]
[li] ^ That is plain unacceptable.[/li]
[/list]
[li]No pictures, no clickers. Common internet rule, don&#39;t make people look at the server themselves.[/li]
[list]
[li]Professional pictures please.[/li]
[/list]
[li]Please, put important links at the top of the topic under your logo/server name.[/li]
[list]
[li]Do it kinda like:[/li]
[list]
[li]&lt;blockquote&gt;[URL=http://www.youtube.com/][img width=50 height=50]http://www.indyzoo.com/SiteAssets/YouTube%20icon%20button.png[/img][/URL][URL=http://www.facebook.com/][img]http://www.steadmanuhlich.com/facebook-icon-50x50.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.wordpress.com/][img]http://findicons.com/files/icons/1979/social/50/wordpress.png[/img][/url]&lt;/blockquote&gt;[/li]
[/list]
[/list]
[li]Got a promotional video? Okay! Put that below your logo/title, and if you have links, above the links.[/li]
[list]
[li]Like:[/li]
[list]
[li]&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=24pt]SERVER NAME[/size]
Promo video here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;[/li]
[/list]
[/list]
[li]In beta and looking to motivate users? Go for a current stage statement.[/li]
[list]
[li]A current stage statement is:[/li]
[list]
[li]&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Current stage: Beta[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[/list]
[li]Put this under your links/promotional video.[/li]
[/list][/ul]


Well, I only made this thread because I saw flaws in multiple advertisements, and I hope this thread benefits you.

Also, fansite/youtube/etc. should be at the bottom of an advertisement thread.<br>
Otherwise, hopefully some people use this.</p>
