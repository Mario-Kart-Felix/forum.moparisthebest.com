    <description>Well, I am making two worlds, each one have the exact same features but, I need to know one thing.

If I log into world 2, all the member items E.g Whip would be named Member, how would I do this, or would I have to go through the Item.cfg ?

I am only doing this for a friend, he needs it and doesn&#39;t have the slightest clue about Java.</description>

              <p>huh what do you mean?</p>
<p>u mean how to make items called member item? and when a member wears it says the real name or you mean somthing like  that some items only can be equiped by members , that one i know how. for the other one pm me and il figer it out for you.<br>
for equiping i made a fast tut.<br>
open ur client.java control+f<br>
and look for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public boolean wear(int wearID, int slot) {</code></pre>
<p>and under this</p>
<p><code>if(wearID == 5509){
emptySmallPouch();
return false;
}</code> paste your own code so it wil look like this</p>
<p><code>if(wearID == 13654 &amp;&amp; (donator != 1)) { //
sM("you need to be a donater to wear this");
return false;
}</code> so this means when a non donater trys to equip it wont work</p>
<p>NOTE:: u need to have donater able , or if u use like member then change the (donator != 1)) to (member != 1))  or whatever u use. if u didn’t do that , look for a gudie there are serval guides here and on runlocus.</p>
