    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Third party client authors&#39; guidelines
This page is intended to give advice to authors of third party clients. Players should still be aware that we do not endorse or recommend the use of such software.

This page does not describe a new rule. This does not add anything not already implied by our fifteen main rules, so unless you are trying to write a third party client that can be used within our rules, or trying to determine if a particular client is allowed for use, you probably do not need to read it.

Nor does this aim to prohibit what you can or cannot create. Rather, it gives you advice on how to make software which is not prohibited for use by our players under Rule 7. This may be of interest if you wish to a) not endanger other peoples&#39; accounts, b) ensure the maximum possible audience for your program, as many users will be put off using your software if to do so they have to break a rule themselves and risk being banned.

Some things to bear in mind:

    * When viewing a free world on a computer display with a resolution higher than 800 x 600, the game pane should default to at least 710 pixels high, and must not be able to scroll vertically. I.e. the game pane must be displayed in such a way that both the game and advert are fully visible at the same time (otherwise it encourages users to break Rule 11).

    * The program should not allow worlds marked as &#39;FULL&#39; on the world select page to be selected (otherwise it encourages users to break Rule 7 - unfair advantage).

    * If the program has its own integrated chat feature separate from the RuneScape chat, it should make it very clear to users that this chat is not part of RuneScape and is not official, endorsed or moderated by Jagex in any way. Furthermore, this chat should still be moderated (just not by us), and the moderators should not allow chat which infringes our rules of conduct. All the rules are important, but in particular if Rule 3 or Rule 9 are regularly breached on the external chat, the program will be considered to endanger users or encourage rule breaking. To avoid confusion with the official RuneScape chat, moderators of the external chat should not be indicated with a silver or gold crown. If the chat is IRC based, then the program should only allow access to IRC channels which conform with the above.

    * The program should not contain adverts or links to websites which encourage rule breaking or endanger users.



We may update this list from time to time to keep it current, hence this is not intended to be an exhaustive list, simply some things to think about. In general, for the program to be allowed for users to use under Rule 7, it must not do anything which encourages rules breaking or endangers users.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>The rule is dumb, but it never takes me more than a few seconds of spamming the login button to get into a full server, and it never takes more than thirty seconds to get to the actual world page.</p>

<p>I know you don’t <span class="bbcode-i">need</span> to update a webclient. But I said everytime runescape is changed. That could be the worlds that changed, that could be the combat calculations, that could be a new skill, that could be a new highscores page, that could even change max hit, and whatever else you can think of.</p>
<p>And THAT will affect the web client and the web client will need to be updated so that it can correspond with the new runescape changes.</p>

<li>They have their own webclient. Look under “Extra Files” on the main page.</li>
<li>There is no need to update webclients, unless Jagex updates the server prefixes. Actually, last time I checked their webclient was just a link to the <a href="http://runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runescape.com</a> mainpage in a frame.</li>

This page is intended to give advice to authors of third party clients. Players should still be aware that we do not endorse or recommend the use of such software.
<p>This page does not describe a new rule. This does not add anything not already implied by our fifteen main rules, so unless you are trying to write a third party client that can be used within our rules, or trying to determine if a particular client is allowed for use, you probably do not need to read it.</p>
<p>Nor does this aim to prohibit what you can or cannot create. Rather, it gives you advice on how to make software which is not prohibited for use by our players under Rule 7. This may be of interest if you wish to a) not endanger other peoples’ accounts, b) ensure the maximum possible audience for your program, as many users will be put off using your software if to do so they have to break a rule themselves and risk being banned.</p>
<p>Some things to bear in mind:</p>
<pre><code>* When viewing a free world on a computer display with a resolution higher than 800 x 600, the game pane should default to at least 710 pixels high, and must not be able to scroll vertically. I.e. the game pane must be displayed in such a way that both the game and advert are fully visible at the same time (otherwise it encourages users to break Rule 11).

* The program should not allow worlds marked as 'FULL' on the world select page to be selected (otherwise it encourages users to break Rule 7 - unfair advantage).

* If the program has its own integrated chat feature separate from the RuneScape chat, it should make it very clear to users that this chat is not part of RuneScape and is not official, endorsed or moderated by Jagex in any way. Furthermore, this chat should still be moderated (just not by us), and the moderators should not allow chat which infringes our rules of conduct. All the rules are important, but in particular if Rule 3 or Rule 9 are regularly breached on the external chat, the program will be considered to endanger users or encourage rule breaking. To avoid confusion with the official RuneScape chat, moderators of the external chat should not be indicated with a silver or gold crown. If the chat is IRC based, then the program should only allow access to IRC channels which conform with the above.

* The program should not contain adverts or links to websites which encourage rule breaking or endanger users.

<p>We may update this list from time to time to keep it current, hence this is not intended to be an exhaustive list, simply some things to think about. In general, for the program to be allowed for users to use under Rule 7, it must not do anything which encourages rules breaking or endangers users.</p>
