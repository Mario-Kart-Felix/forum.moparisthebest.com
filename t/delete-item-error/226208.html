        <p>OMG! I’m so close to this new minigame I can almost taste it… there’s just two errors, one is<br>
-The damn chest won’t give me my money for my two rings<br>
-It won’t delete the damn rings from my inventory!!</p>
<p>If you want to read about what I’m doing in the first place just read the end of the message but you don’t have to read that as it shows no relevance to my problem…</p>
<p>so I put in a case for  a chest</p>
<p><code>  case 2191:   //2191 is the object ID for the chest I'm using
		if (playerHasItem(1603) == true &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(1607) == true) {
			addItem(995, 500000);
			deleteItem(1603, getItemSlot(1603), 1);
			deleteItem(1607, getItemSlot(1607), 1);
		} else {
			sendMessage("You need BOTH OF THE RINGS to get your reward");
		}
		break;  
</code></p>
<p>Okay, now what I was trying to do was make it to where if you had the sapphire ring (1603) AND the ruby ring (1607) it would give you a reward of 500k (995, 500000), now when I compile it, it shows up as complete, no errors, but when I click on the chest with my two rings… NOTHING HAPPENS!!!</p>
<p>So obviously I did something wrong… could someone please point out what I did wrong?<br>
Thanks, 00ryn00</p>

<p><em><strong><strong><strong>This is optional, but if you want to see what I’m up to, feel free to read this part, but again this has NO signifigance</strong></strong></strong></em>*****</p>
<p>So I’ve been trying to make a newer version of Clan Wars that wasnt a shitty remake of Castle Wars, well some attempts at my invisioned Clan Wars came to a suttle end when no one would help me figure out a scoring system for Clan Wars, or help me with a Clan interface (Clan Chat, a way to make a Clan with your friends, a way to show who’s clan was on top…) or help me with a way to make the region for th Clan Wars minigame… So I totally remade everything (except for the location of the portals and the arena) and I started working on my new version of Clan Wars (that was pretty much ten times easier)<br>
So heres what happens…<br>
-To start off Clan Wars you go into the Guthix Portal in the Home area, and it takes you to the Clan Wars choosing center (where you choose between two clans the Blood Clan and Dire Clan…<br>
-So you choose your tream and you teleport to the Clan Wars arena (Better known as a suped up version of the Lava Maze, it has barriers and stuff for archers and mages to stand behind, and later on I might even add some NPC’S and the standards for each team (the flags) but they wouldn’t be usable) You obtain (depending on your Clan) a Sapphire ring, or a Ruby ring, and the cape for the side that you chose…<br>
-Now you should put on the cape that you got, that way your team members don’t attack you… And you have to find and kill a member of the other Clan and take the ring that was given to them at the start<br>
-Then once you have BOTH rings, you go to the Clan Wars Exit portal (if you don’t have both rings or your clan’s cape, you don’t get to leave Clan Wars) When you exit the portal you loose your Clan’s Cape and you appear in front of the Clan Wars Chest<br>
-So then, if you have your rings, you click on the chest (this is part I’m having trouble with) you get your reward* and you can then play Clan Wars again…</p>
<p>*I will later on add Clan Wars Points so that when you click on the chest, not only do you get the 500k but you also get +5 clan points (and during the game you also get pk points)</p>
