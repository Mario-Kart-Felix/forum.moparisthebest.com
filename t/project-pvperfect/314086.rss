To fill you in this is my project:

1. Take a base. In this case Whitescape. Clean it out, remove TPC. [b]This is done[/b]
Features:
- Logging in almost perfect
- Walking
- Running almost perfect
- Banking nearly 100%
- A few handellers....
- Shops
- Npcs (need perfecting)

2. (this is where you come in)

Make a perfect combat base aka Attacking, Ranging and Magic.

- Player v player
- Player v NPC - 100% perfect like Final Devolution 2.7
- NPC v NPC
- Multiplayer PVP
- Perfect specials

Stabilise it a bit.

So basically it will be clean, Stable and have only combat. This will be PERFECT for what people will want!

BUT why will people choose this?

Ill tell you why.

1. Hyperion and other fantastically clean servers people dont bother to use.

2. If its packaged, it fails unless its final devo...

3. People are shit lazy.

4. Perfect combat = what people want.

5. final devo is shit except its combat.
