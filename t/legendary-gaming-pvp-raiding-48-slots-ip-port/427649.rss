Welcome to LegendaryGaming!!
A Survival PvP server
To those who have no idea what this means, well let me explain. . Well this server,its simple. You start with nothing, go out into the wilderness and try to survive, build a home, produce weapons, food and tools. Store you’re resources and go out to explore for other enemy homes and raid them.

There are rules to follow though which can be found on the rule boards within the city. Breaking any of these rules, depending on which one, will result in a punishment. This is a strict PvP server, excuses aren’t accepted due to the amount of time we have spent making sure you have the opportunity to read the rules.

Raiding others bases is allowed, but griefing their homes is not. If anyone is griefed an admin will respond and investigate, which will result in either several days in jail, or a temporary/permenant ban, depending on the extent of the damage, and the amount of times the user has broken this rule.</description>
