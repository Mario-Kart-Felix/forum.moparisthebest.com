          <blockquote>
              <p>Should add more media to make people want to click on the links otherwise not many people are going to wait for the cache to download and what not. Also, the homepage is VERY, and I mean VERY blank. The homepage should also be some form of advertisement for the server so people will want to come online either on the forum or server as well. There’s WAY too much free space that could be used as such, and the forum theme is so off that I couldn’t believe it. You might be using a theme that I’ve not seen but it doesn’t make much of a difference when it looks weird as Hell, and there’s at least not a bit of it to match the homepage.</p>
<p>Good luck with development and what not though, wish for the best.</p>
