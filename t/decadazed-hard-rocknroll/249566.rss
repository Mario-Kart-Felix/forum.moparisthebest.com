    <title>DecaDAZED - Hard Rock&#39;n&#39;roll</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decadazed-hard-rocknroll/249566</link>
    <description>Hello!

My brother have a band, and they wish to get their music out to as many as possible. Therefore I thought it would be a great thing to write about them here, in case someone here find them interesting.

Anyhow, they are called DecaDAZED, and the genre is what you can call Hard Rock&#39;n&#39;roll (atleast that is what they say themselves).

They have just recently made a video to one of their songs, called &#39;Entrust Me&#39;. It can be watched at the following YouTube-link [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7kO1B-uOWM]here[/url].

They also got a MySpace-account, which is called DecaDAZED, just like their band-name (obviously). So if you like their video, you perhaps might want to check them out there aswell...

Hope you like. :)</description>
