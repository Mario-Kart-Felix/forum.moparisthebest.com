[i]This isn&#39;t a game website about games to do with xbox 360&#39;s or ps3&#39;s and stuff like that. It&#39;s own programmed fps and mmorpg&#39;s that wev&#39;e worked on for 2 years now. It&#39;s not spoon fed like private servers where you got it straight infront of you, the movements, the colours, weapons, places and all the rest of it.[/i]

Our main game series were working on at the moment is Externoz. 

[b]Externoz-[/b] [b]Fps[/b]
[b]Externoz revolution-[/b] [b]Fps[/b]
[b]Externoz legacy-[/b] [b]Mmorpg[/b]

Were also working on an arcade website called SF-games where our 2d mmorpg&#39;s are in construction. We need members to get [b]Enternal Legacy[/b] going so joining the community would help a lot. It&#39;s run by two people, me 0wn7g3 and Slim Fly. When we get into bigger developments we might need some more people but it&#39;s much more complex than programming a P server.
