<p>The policy I mentioned has been in place since at least when the 90s scandal was going on, possibly earlier.  I know that if abuse is reported to our deacon or priest, they are instructed to first call local authorities, and only then inform the church.</p>
<p>Well, I would define a ‘true Christian’ as someone who lives their life following the teachings of Jesus Christ, which certainly don’t include rape, or protecting rapists.</p>

              <p>I didn’t watch the video, but everyone agrees this was bad and was wrong, and the Catholic church’s policy is now to go directly to the local authorities first with any questions or allegations of anything, and then to church authorities.</p>
<p>edit:<br>
Personally, however, I think anyone who abuses anyone sexually should have their junk cut off and then killed in a slow and painful way, regardless.  No real Christian would ever do anything like that, regardless of what they call themselves.</p>
