    <title>Help with the java command please</title>

    <description>ok, I ALWAYS get the error:
&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file

I know this has answers and I have tried them, In the rules, faqs, and basic information sticky, I followed the link that PaulT posted as an answer to this problem. Apparantley, windows cannot find the compiler (which is jdk, correct?) which is installed on my system on C:\Program Files\Java\jdkwhatever, and yet my computer is too stupid to find it, i read somewhere on these forums that you should reinstall the jdk (I did that twice), and yet i still got that annoying error message. the tut said to &#39;At the prompt you would type the following command and press Enter: 

C:\jdk6\bin\javac HelloWorldApp.java

what prompt!!! I&#39;m a noob with java crap! i dont see any prompt! anyway, when i couldnt find any prompts, I continued reading and saw that instead of that, you could &#39;Update the path variable&#39; or soemthing, i have goen to the system window, then to environment variable and made a variable called Java, with the path right to the bind directory of the jdk, just like it said to. Then i tried to run the compiler on phonescape source again, and got the damned error message! so i thought i mustve doen the wrong path, i went back and redid the path to the other jdk i had (yes, i installed both the online and offline, not knowing which one i should get), i put in the path right to the bin directory in the other jdk (just like it said!) and still got the error!

with the path thing not working, i decided to try the otehr way the tut said that i couldnt understand (which still confuses me, because its telling me to make the path to bin\javac&quot; MyClass.java now!) I still cant understand wth im supposed to do there, so I&#39;m now reading the entire tutorial on this.... it says that java MAY (it didn&#39;t) ask me to reboot my computer.. ok im gonna reboot my comp, even though it didnt ask me to. uh.. ill just post this and edit it if it works or not when i get back (im thinkign of things to try as i am writing this thread, so i might as well try them!)

ok.. whe  i turned my comp off, it said installing update 1 of 1.. so i thought it would work because i THOUGHT it was updating java or something, so i tried comiling, and guess what?
&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. Press any key to continue . . .

it didn&#39;t work -.- can somebody please help me, i don&#39;t know what to do! (i read in the rules section not to post anythign like this unless i show that i have tried to solved it, and ive tried!)


it works!!! (i think) thank you mod taharok!!! (http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,49747.0.html) i thank you so much for the perfect compiler! w00t!   sry for making such a useless thread i guess, since i answered my own question O.o</description>
