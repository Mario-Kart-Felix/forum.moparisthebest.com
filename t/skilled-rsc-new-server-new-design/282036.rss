people on this forum talk about DDOS as if they know what it means or does. Seriously, a DDOS cannot break or malfunction any of your computer equipment. Unless you added your own computer to a existing botnet, most attacks are futile. For example, my friend is hosting a WoW server from his own computer. Americans play this server when it is located in australia. (No lag for americans). Someone attempted to DDOS his server + website. just to proove how pathetic this attack was against his server: His overall CPU increased by 10% and stayed that way, he then unloaded all of it a redirected it back to the proxy it was being sent from using a “little program”. The americans or australians didnt even notice it. It can only cut out your internet connection if your ISP is retarded.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Nobody ever said it will break your computer. It will hit you offline for quite a bit of time, in which you have to reset your router and such, which is extremely boring. Oh, and the attack your friend got was jack shit. A recent attack upon RscR’s Dedicated server, brought down 100+ of the Dedicated server’s customers, due to them being on the same line. That is a real DDoS attack, as it involved tons of Bots, and was most likely a rented botnet.</p>
<p>Cut out your internet if your isp is retarded? LMAO. Thats why $500 a month dedi’s go down whenever DDoS’ed by most 1k+ nets? Yeah Man, you know what your talking about totally -.- If it was the “ISP” that determined if you hot hit ofline, I think ppl wouldn’t spend $100’s monthly for software/hardware firewalls, and just switch ISPs.</p>

<p>Rofl, you’re paying $500 for a dedi which is using a shared line across 100 servers? Get your money back…</p>

Actually if your ISP isnt retarded which I bet most american ones are. Australian ones provide multiple fibre-cable backbone connections to seperate servers providing the same service to provide excellent performance. ( From ISP website ): “We also use load balancing technology to distribute web traffic between multiple servers, further increasing availability, performance and security.”, "We use only the latest, cutting edge hardware and software to give you superior performance with minimal downtime. Reliable network features Dell PowerEdge high speed servers, Cisco network hardware, and multiple fibre optic connections to the Internet backbone. "</p>
<p>Its exactly why companies like blizzard and jagex do it to prevent no lives like yourself from getting their way on the games. I’m sure you know what your talking about as well, indeed.</p>
<p>Also, people like “tewl” claim that they own botnets when they add their own computers to one that is networked publicly. The sad thing is that these people have no idea how to hack and claim themselves to be gods. These public botnets can also be quite strong if known how to use them, and no offence. But why do you put “- Kozy” at the end of everything you post?  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>people on this forum talk about DDOS as if they know what it means or does. Seriously, a DDOS cannot break or malfunction any of your computer equipment. Unless you added your own computer to a existing botnet, most attacks are futile. For example, my friend is hosting a WoW server from his own computer. Americans play this server when it is located in australia. (No lag for americans). Someone attempted to DDOS his server + website. just to proove how pathetic this attack was against his server: His overall CPU increased by 10% and stayed that way, he then unloaded all of it a redirected it back to the proxy it was being sent from using a “little program”. The americans or australians didnt even notice it. It can only cut out your internet connection if your ISP is retarded.</p>

</aside>
<p>Nobody ever said it will break your computer. It will hit you offline for quite a bit of time, in which you have to reset your router and such, which is extremely boring. Oh, and the attack your friend got was jack shit. A recent attack upon RscR’s Dedicated server, brought down 100+ of the Dedicated server’s customers, due to them being on the same line. That is a real DDoS attack, as it involved tons of Bots, and was most likely a rented botnet.</p>
<p>Cut out your internet if your isp is retarded? LMAO. Thats why $500 a month dedi’s go down whenever DDoS’ed by most 1k+ nets? Yeah Man, you know what your talking about totally -.- If it was the “ISP” that determined if you hot hit ofline, I think ppl wouldn’t spend $100’s monthly for software/hardware firewalls, and just switch ISPs.</p>
