    <title>My servers advertisement was deleted?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-servers-advertisement-was-deleted/545360</link>
    <description>My advertisement for Dodian XIV got deleted.  We had it up since march, had 2000+ votes, and have even bought mopar sponsorship.  I would like to request for it to be restored, or at least a reason as to why it was deleted.  We never violated the terms, and all of our votes were legit.</description>

<p>edit:<br>
Or, as it turns out, a staff member accidentally hits the ban or delete button (there is no way for them to unban or undelete).  Sorry about that, I have restored it manually.  Also, the link in your signature is wrong <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
