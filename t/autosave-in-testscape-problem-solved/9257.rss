    <description>I was sent here after posting in the tutorial section, sorry bout that

i have yet to figure out how this is done. the autosave tutorials refrence to commands not in testscape, and the one result in a search was completely unhelpful. can anyone tell me how to put an autosave at a 30 second interval in testscape?</description>
