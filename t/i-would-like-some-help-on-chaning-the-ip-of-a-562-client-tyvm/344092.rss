              <p>Open the Source folder, If you dont have it Press ALT so you get a toolbar at thhe top,  Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View &gt; Show Hidden files, Folders and drives.</p>
<p>Okay, so you have opened the source file search for client.java<br>
Edit it, Once your on that screen the default ip is 127.0.0.1 So try that first. No luck? Try 0.0.0.0<br>
If not still you will have to find out wat the IP is.</p>
<p>Then change to yours, Save. Then compile, Have fun!<br>
