    <title>Q: How to make monster attack you after you range them?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/q-how-to-make-monster-attack-you-after-you-range-them/242936</link>
    <description>Ok, this is what I have got so far:

ver 1:
I range monster, I get teleported to him and fighting is like normal, with 3 rounds and all

ver 2:
I range monster, he will attack me instantly and his sprite is where he was before.

On both of these versions, if I attack a player with ranged, he will suddenly be like mob - forced to attack me.

How to make monster follow you after you range him/her and then finally attack you, when he reaches you?

I have so far used statement: if(!affectedMob.isBusy){&lt;here goes all that code&gt;} and only edited RangeEvent. Should I do dealing with AttackHandler/FightEvent? Or can I mount it all to RangeEvent? And how to fix those bugs or what way should be more efficient?

Thanks in advance,
