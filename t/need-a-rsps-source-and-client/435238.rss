    <title>Need a RSPS (Source and Client)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-rsps-source-and-client/435238</link>
    <description>Hey guys, so I have wanted to make an RSPS for a few months now and dled many a source (server) and client.  About 5 months ago I was able to do some basic java coding within a 317.  My favorite release is either 508 or 562, but I have no clue how to code or work with it.  What I want is a source and client that works for me that I can add things to, not a blank.  I know I have way to many sources and clients, but few of them work... If any of you could suggest one to focus on, or one I don&#39;t have. Please provide a source AND client.  Few details about my computer, Win7, 4GB, 1.6GHz, jre7, jdk1.7.0.  I would like at least most of the skills to work, if 508+ GE would be beast.  And please provide anything I may need to know or need.  Thanks guys!  :D

Here is a list of sources and clients I have:
Tokkulscape 508
RS2HD
HyBrid PvP
Teamtorva
Umairscape v4
Unleashed Pkz
StabbingScape V2.2
Youbleedred 562
Alex Isle v2.8
AtomicScape 562
Battlesoft
Blazescape
Bluecore 508
CasutionX V1
DavidScape V7
DeathScape
GazaaScape
NullPkz
Project Amaze

I also have ZodiacsReign Package V8.0

Sorry if in wrong section.</description>

              <p>Hey, use a Torva pkz v2 client and source… Excellent base but with not that many new things.
