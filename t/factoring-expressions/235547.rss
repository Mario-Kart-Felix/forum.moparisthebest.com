    <title>Factoring expressions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/factoring-expressions/235547</link>
    <description>I missed yesterday and we went over factoring expressions.
I&#39;m good in math, but I don&#39;t pay attention. I payed attention when the teacher was going over the homework, which is what I&#39;m doing right now, but I have come to an equation that I&#39;m not sure how to factor.

2x^2-9x+4
I have gotten as far as: (2x  )(x  )
But I&#39;m not sure as to whether or not those are negative or positive. Please help!</description>

              <p>Thanks chris. I partly figured it out on my own(AKA. I used a site to solve it for me tried to figure out what it was doing), but that is a much better explanation. Thanks again.</p>
<p>Edit: I came to another problem that is similar and was able to do it and finally remembered watching the teacher explain how to do it.</p>
<p>Re-edit: I’m just now finishing that homework. An hour and a half later  :mad: That’s what factoring 75 expressions will do for ya.</p>
