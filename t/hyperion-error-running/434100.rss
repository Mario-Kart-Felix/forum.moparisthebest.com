    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-error-running/434100</link>
    <description>[s]I recently switch from PI so i&#39;m new to Hyperion and Eclipse all together.
So anyways, I&#39;ve never seen this error before and was hoping you guys* could help me out.
 FYI: I have already configured the build-path.[/s]

[s]I&#39;m not asking for you to spoon feed me. I&#39;m just new to java and would like to learn. Thanks.[/s]

For any of you who need this fix, just simply update your XStream files in your Lib folder. You can download them from here: [url=https://nexus.codehaus.org/content/repositories/releases/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream-distribution/1.4.2/xstream-distribution-1.4.2-bin.zip]https://nexus.codehaus.org/content/repositories/releases/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream-distribution/1.4.2/xstream-distribution-1.4.2-bin.zip[/url]</description>
