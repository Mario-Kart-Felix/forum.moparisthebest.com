    <title>Assimilation. 666 Server, from scratch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/assimilation-666-server-from-scratch/418790</link>
    <description>[size=18pt]You may be asking yourself. Is this based off a 666 server? Well as i know of, there ARE no 666 servers out there. So no to that. This is a server made for one reason, joy. That&#39;s right, we are fed up of runescape, the crappy economy, the shit players. Etc. 
      
This will be an interesting 666, we are currently working on the frame working for it. (This is Netty based, should hold 2000+ players). People such as (I am using real names, for some of them are cough*canownueasy*cough banned from all rsps communities. Thomas, Jordan, etc. Will be helping me. We have many goals, and we expect this to take us about a good 4 or 5 months of work, depending on who we get working on it. Netty wont be done for about 3 weeks, so don&#39;t expect any pictures until the middle of November. 

This being said, i have starting theorizing about custom content, and this is where you come in. Please suggest custom skills, etc. That we can add, and if i like it, i will post a poll. at the end of 2 weeks, the skill or content with the most votes gets added. Well with that being said, as soon as we have logging in done, expect pictures!  [/size]</description>
