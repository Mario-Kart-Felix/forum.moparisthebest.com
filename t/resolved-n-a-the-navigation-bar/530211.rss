    <title>[RESOLVED - N/A]The navigation bar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-n-a-the-navigation-bar/530211</link>
    <description>I have seen two other threads regarding the navbar, we now have a homepage, but no way to access it from the forums, and yet the IRC is there and so is RS Wiki, I suggest that the current &quot;Home&quot; button redirect to our homepage and add another for to access the board index (forums), the IRC Chat button be renamed to Shoutbox, Chat, or something a little less confusing to new users and finally add a link to the Server Status Page.

Support? 

edit: sorry for the redundancy, I know David has a thread about IRC open.</description>
