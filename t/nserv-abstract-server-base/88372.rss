    <description>I made this because I could not connect to the internet for a few days and had nothing better to do.

[b]EDIT:[/b] There are quite a few misconceptions in the README, such as the version and the date at the top, also the mandatory keys, if you read the change log you will see that only a few of those keys are mandatory now.

&lt;blockquote&gt;NServ is not guaranteed or covered by any warranty, implied or otherwise.
NServ is provided &quot;AS IS&quot;, with liability associated to the person or persons who use this product.

NServ is open-source software, I like having the ability to discuss and be criticised for my work.

Any bugs, suggestions, complaints (no spam, or requests for help to write your &quot;1337 53rv3r5&quot;), drop me a line:

Now, for the readme...

NServ version 1.0a_WIP ~ copyright 2006 newbiehacker
1 April 2007.

=================================
==          CHANGELOG          ==
=================================
1.11b:
    I decided to add a port switch, although I am makign the configuration file more and more
    redundant, I&#39;m making it even easier to modify server settings =/
1.1b:
    First release! (or would be if I could get online, you may have to wait until after the BETA stages =/)
    BufferedProtocolAdapter now implements DataInput so we have some base for reading data.
    Client now implements DataOutput so we have a base for writing data too xD
    Changed some keys from mandatory to optional: inputpriority, inputwait, outputpriority, outputbuffer, outputwait,
        outputsize.
1.0a_WIP:
    First creation, created README, spliced classes and shit, decided to include changelog.
    Not much to say seeing as this is the first incarnation, but check back for more.


=================================
==           README            ==
=================================
NServ is a basic server base with a threaded system for controlling the connection of clients and IO.

It provides classes for basic functionality as well as a basic framework for improvement. 
Running the server requires 2 things:
 + A ProtocolHandler (an implementation of org.newbiehacker.nserv.ProtocolHandler)
 + A configuration file with all mandatory keys filled in. (Configuration files are defined below)

=================================
==      Configuration files    ==
=================================
The configuration file is mandatory, it either has to be in the directory data/config.ini
relative to where you are running the Server from, or you can specify the configuration file
using the &#39;c&#39; switch from the command line.

# Mandatory keys #

Mandatory keys are keys that are required for stable running of the server.
In a future version, I hope to make most of these keys optional, but at the moment, I just don&#39;t have the time.
If one of these keys are not defined, the server actions are un-defined.

port                The port this server should listen on for connections.
maxconnections      The maximum amount of connections this server should allow to connect.
inputpriority       The Thread priority of our InputThread
inputwait           The wait (in milliseconds) between each iteration of the InputThread
outputpriority      The Thread priority of our OutputThread
outputbuffer        The size of the output buffer (per client) in bytes. (1024 bytes is 1kB)
outputwait          The wait (in milliseconds) between each iteration of the OutputThread
outputsize          This specifies how how much we can write (per client) in each iteration.
                    If the server attempts to write more than that then the client will be
                    disconnected with no warning.  This is useful for implementations that can&#39;t
                    be bothered to check for flooding.

# Optional keys #

Optional keys are keys that are not required by the server, but can be used to do certain things that
would not otherwise be possible.

handler             This key is not mandatory, but you have to either define the ProtocolHandler here
                    or in the server arguments.
debug               This key allows us to decide whether the server should be verbose in its output

# Other Keys #

Other keys are not used by the server base at all, but can be accessed by a ProtocolHandler or a
Plugin.  Simply to give the user more control.

=================================
==       ProtocolHandlers      ==
=================================

ProtocolHandlers are used to implement a basic server using the base.  You can either implement
ProtocolHandler or use the provided BufferedProtocolAdapter which provides an implementation
which buffers all input from a client and allows reading operation similar to those of a DataInputStream.

A simple implementation might be a terminal-based remote execution server or something along those lines.
Or you could implement an HTTP or IRC server.

=================================
==          Plugins            ==
=================================

Plugins allow plugin functionality such as a GUI to handle connected clients or handle your implementation.

Plugins should implement org.newbiehacker.nserv.Plugin.

=================================
==      Running the server     ==
=================================

To use the server you basically run a shell/batch file (or use terminal/command prompt)
and either specify the ProtocolHandler in the arguments, or in the configuration file.

The main class is org.newbiehacker.nserv.Server

So, for example, say I had a ProtocolHandler org.newbiehacker.handlerimpl.IRCProtocol, I could either
run:
java org.newbiehacker.nserv.Server -h &quot;org.newbiehacker.handlerimpl.IRCProtocol&quot;
or change my configuration file so that the handler key is org.newbiehacker.handlerimpl.IRCProtocol.

The syntax for running the server is
org.newbiehacker.nserv.Server -switches arguments...

Arguments are in the order that the switches are defined.
Arguments can be either simple strings with no spaces, or a double-quote enclosed string such as &quot;Hello World&quot;.

So, say I have some switches, q, that takes one argument, r takes no argument and s takes an argument,
I could run the server in a few ways which all produce the same results:

-qrs arg1 &quot;argument 2&quot;       This would pass &quot;arg1&quot; to q, and &quot;argument 2&quot; to s.
-sqr &quot;argument 2&quot; arg1       This would pass &quot;argument 2&quot; to s and &quot;arg1&quot; to q.

This (I hope) will make it easier to configure the server for your needs.

Switches are as follows: (Switches marked with a * override settings in the configuration file)
-help (as a full argument)   Displays the list of arguments and quits.
c  CONFIG                    Specifies a location on where to load the configuration file.
d*                           Enables debug mode.
h* HANDLERCLASS              Specifies the fully qualified name of the handler class to use.
p  PLUGINLIST                Specifies plugins to load during initialization, format is as follows:
                                 &quot;pluginclass {arguments};&quot;
                                 Arguments are optional, and multiple plugins can be specified as long as they are
                                 seperated by a semi-colon &#39;;&#39;.  Arguments should be seperated by a space, and NOT
                                 enclosed within double quotes.
o* PORT                      Specifies the port to bind the server to.

There is some stuff I missed out, but look at the javadocs for a clearer idea.

I hope you enjoyed reading it more than I enjoyed writing it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Now, for the readme…</p>
<p>NServ version 1.0a_WIP ~ copyright 2006 newbiehacker<br>
1 April 2007.</p>
<h1>=================================<br>
==          CHANGELOG          ==</h1>
<p>1.11b:<br>
I decided to add a port switch, although I am makign the configuration file more and more<br>
redundant, I’m making it even easier to modify server settings =/<br>
1.1b:<br>
First release! (or would be if I could get online, you may have to wait until after the BETA stages =/)<br>
BufferedProtocolAdapter now implements DataInput so we have some base for reading data.<br>
Client now implements DataOutput so we have a base for writing data too xD<br>
Changed some keys from mandatory to optional: inputpriority, inputwait, outputpriority, outputbuffer, outputwait,<br>
outputsize.<br>
1.0a_WIP:<br>
First creation, created README, spliced classes and shit, decided to include changelog.<br>
Not much to say seeing as this is the first incarnation, but check back for more.</p>
<h1>=================================<br>
==           README            ==</h1>
<p>NServ is a basic server base with a threaded system for controlling the connection of clients and IO.</p>
<p>It provides classes for basic functionality as well as a basic framework for improvement.<br>
Running the server requires 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ProtocolHandler (an implementation of org.newbiehacker.nserv.ProtocolHandler)</li>
<li>A configuration file with all mandatory keys filled in. (Configuration files are defined below)</li>
</ul>
<h1>=================================<br>
==      Configuration files    ==</h1>
<p>The configuration file is mandatory, it either has to be in the directory data/config.ini<br>
relative to where you are running the Server from, or you can specify the configuration file<br>
using the ‘c’ switch from the command line.</p>
<h1>Mandatory keys</h1>
<p>Mandatory keys are keys that are required for stable running of the server.<br>
In a future version, I hope to make most of these keys optional, but at the moment, I just don’t have the time.<br>
If one of these keys are not defined, the server actions are un-defined.</p>
<p>port                The port this server should listen on for connections.<br>
maxconnections      The maximum amount of connections this server should allow to connect.<br>
inputpriority       The Thread priority of our InputThread<br>
inputwait           The wait (in milliseconds) between each iteration of the InputThread<br>
outputpriority      The Thread priority of our OutputThread<br>
outputbuffer        The size of the output buffer (per client) in bytes. (1024 bytes is 1kB)<br>
outputwait          The wait (in milliseconds) between each iteration of the OutputThread<br>
outputsize          This specifies how how much we can write (per client) in each iteration.<br>
If the server attempts to write more than that then the client will be<br>
disconnected with no warning.  This is useful for implementations that can’t<br>
be bothered to check for flooding.</p>
<h1>Optional keys</h1>
<p>Optional keys are keys that are not required by the server, but can be used to do certain things that<br>
would not otherwise be possible.</p>
<p>handler             This key is not mandatory, but you have to either define the ProtocolHandler here<br>
or in the server arguments.<br>
debug               This key allows us to decide whether the server should be verbose in its output</p>
<h1>Other Keys</h1>
<p>Other keys are not used by the server base at all, but can be accessed by a ProtocolHandler or a<br>
Plugin.  Simply to give the user more control.</p>
<h1>=================================<br>
==       ProtocolHandlers      ==</h1>
<p>ProtocolHandlers are used to implement a basic server using the base.  You can either implement<br>
ProtocolHandler or use the provided BufferedProtocolAdapter which provides an implementation<br>
which buffers all input from a client and allows reading operation similar to those of a DataInputStream.</p>
<p>A simple implementation might be a terminal-based remote execution server or something along those lines.<br>
Or you could implement an HTTP or IRC server.</p>
<h1>=================================<br>
==          Plugins            ==</h1>
<p>Plugins allow plugin functionality such as a GUI to handle connected clients or handle your implementation.</p>
<p>Plugins should implement org.newbiehacker.nserv.Plugin.</p>
<h1>=================================<br>
==      Running the server     ==</h1>
<p>To use the server you basically run a shell/batch file (or use terminal/command prompt)<br>
and either specify the ProtocolHandler in the arguments, or in the configuration file.</p>
<p>The main class is org.newbiehacker.nserv.Server</p>
<p>So, for example, say I had a ProtocolHandler org.newbiehacker.handlerimpl.IRCProtocol, I could either<br>
run:<br>
java org.newbiehacker.nserv.Server -h “org.newbiehacker.handlerimpl.IRCProtocol”<br>
or change my configuration file so that the handler key is org.newbiehacker.handlerimpl.IRCProtocol.</p>
<p>The syntax for running the server is<br>
org.newbiehacker.nserv.Server -switches arguments…</p>
<p>Arguments are in the order that the switches are defined.<br>
Arguments can be either simple strings with no spaces, or a double-quote enclosed string such as “Hello World”.</p>
<p>So, say I have some switches, q, that takes one argument, r takes no argument and s takes an argument,<br>
I could run the server in a few ways which all produce the same results:</p>
<p>-qrs arg1 “argument 2”       This would pass “arg1” to q, and “argument 2” to s.<br>
-sqr “argument 2” arg1       This would pass “argument 2” to s and “arg1” to q.</p>
<p>This (I hope) will make it easier to configure the server for your needs.</p>
<p>Switches are as follows: (Switches marked with a * override settings in the configuration file)<br>
-help (as a full argument)   Displays the list of arguments and quits.<br>
c  CONFIG                    Specifies a location on where to load the configuration file.<br>
d*                           Enables debug mode.<br>
h* HANDLERCLASS              Specifies the fully qualified name of the handler class to use.<br>
p  PLUGINLIST                Specifies plugins to load during initialization, format is as follows:<br>
“pluginclass {arguments};”<br>
Arguments are optional, and multiple plugins can be specified as long as they are<br>
seperated by a semi-colon ‘;’.  Arguments should be seperated by a space, and NOT<br>
enclosed within double quotes.<br>
o* PORT                      Specifies the port to bind the server to.</p>
<p>There is some stuff I missed out, but look at the javadocs for a clearer idea.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed reading it more than I enjoyed writing it.</p>
