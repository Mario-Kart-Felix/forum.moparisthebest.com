    <title>Battle Royale</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/battle-royale/9467</link>
    <description>At the turn of the millenium Japan falls into chaos, as students go wild. The japanese goverment decides to initiate a new law, the Battle Royale. Every year a class of ninth graders are picked to be brought to an island. There they must kill each other till there is only one left. The thing is that they only have 3 days to do so. This year the class which our main character Nanahara Shuya is selected. What will happen, who will die? watch to find out.

Overall i give this movie a 8/10. Somehow you actually care when a person dies a gruesome death because this movie manages to mix you deep into the characters. Flashbacks give you insight on them and there relationships seem to draw you into it.


Ill try to improve this review sorry, didn&#39;t have that much time but it gives you the basic picture, death.</description>
