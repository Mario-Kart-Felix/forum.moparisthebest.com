    <description>

1. On my server, its impossible to get skulled. Players keep 3 items+ no matter what. I want it to be like 2005 Runescape. Skull= Lose all.

2. How do I change General Graddor&#39;s healing frequency to lower? Because it heals way too much, and it heals over his max hp. How do I change it so he can&#39;t heal to like 50000 Hp?

3. How do I figure out what items will lose on death? I have the &quot;item kept on death&quot; button, but it can&#39;t be opened up.

4. How do I add ava effect? picks up arrows.

5. My server have void, but how do I know if it has the effect?

6. How do i add specs on Npcs?

7. How do I speed up the dragon claws spec? Its a little slow.

8. How do I add the Dark Bow specs+graphics. Right now, it shoots out ghosts when you spec. -.-

9. How do I add Dragon Arrows to match up with Dark bow+Effects?

10. How do I change the client background?

11. How do I add the other godwar bosses except for General Graddor? And with the animations. Right now, my general gradoor&#39;s arms become invisible when it moves.

12. How do I change some items store price to PK Points? I added pvp armour, and was going to add them to the PK Point store. But it comes up as coins worth.

13. How do I add range void effect? Or where do I check if its already added?
