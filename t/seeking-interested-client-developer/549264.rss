It was an idea to start a new, unique, never-before-seen RuneScape Private Server for months between two great friends. With months of talking about it, the motivation wasn&#39;t quite enough. But finally, we noticed that RuneScape Private Servers are just dying and repeating. In late November 2014, the name Ascaria was set in stone. Mod Jon, Owner, and Mod Four, Co-Owner, are the ones responsible for the birth of Ascaria.
