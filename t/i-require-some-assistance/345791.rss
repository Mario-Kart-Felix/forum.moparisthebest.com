    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-require-some-assistance/345791</link>
    <description>I need some help i just downloaded creative scape because i am interested in it alot but  i cant get anything to run. I downaoded a client/server/Cache fille off the topic. i changed the run and compiller to run with my current jdk (jdk1.6.0_17) and as soon as i try to run the command prompts just say they cannot find the specified path. I have encountered this problem before but it usuaily fixes when i change the jdk... 

I feel like a newb for asking this question but can someone help me please :)</description>
