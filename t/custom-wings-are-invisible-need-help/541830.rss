    <title>Custom Wings Are Invisible Need Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-wings-are-invisible-need-help/541830</link>
    <description>The model of the wings show up in both metasequoia and datmaker just fine. I turned the wing files into a .dat and moved them into my raw file. When i spawn the wings and put them on they are invisible, and I dont know what I did wrong.

This is my itemdef for wings that work and show up just fine 12282 drop model and 11122 wear
case 20073:
itemDef.modelid = 12282;
itemDef.modelZoom = 850;
itemDef.modelRotationX = 252;
itemDef.modelRotationY = 1020;
itemDef.modelOffset1 = -1;
itemDef.modelOffset2 = 24;
itemDef.stackable = false;
itemDef.value = 1;
itemDef.membersObject = true;
itemDef.anInt165 = 11122;
itemDef.anInt200 = 11122;
itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
itemDef.itemActions[4] = &quot;Drop&quot;;
itemDef.editedModelColor = new int[1];
itemDef.newModelColor = new int[1];
itemDef.editedModelColor[0] = 926;
itemDef.newModelColor[0] = 1;
itemDef.name = &quot;Angel Wings&quot;;
itemDef.description = &quot;Some Angel Wings&quot;;
break;

These dont work, they are just recolored verson of the angel wings, 60001 drop model and 60002 wear model. Both the .dat files are in my raw folder
case 20090:
itemDef.modelid = 60001;
itemDef.modelZoom = 850;
itemDef.modelRotationX = 252;
itemDef.modelRotationY = 1020;
itemDef.modelOffset1 = -1;
itemDef.modelOffset2 = 24;
itemDef.stackable = false;
itemDef.value = 1;
itemDef.membersObject = true;
itemDef.anInt165 = 60000;
itemDef.anInt200 = 60000;
itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
itemDef.itemActions[4] = &quot;Drop&quot;;
itemDef.editedModelColor = new int[1];
itemDef.newModelColor = new int[1];
itemDef.editedModelColor[0] = 926;
itemDef.newModelColor[0] = 1;
itemDef.name = &quot;Rasta Wings&quot;;
itemDef.description = &quot;Some Rasta Wings&quot;;
break;


these dont work (they are a different shape than the angel wings) 60003 drop model and 60002 wear model, i have tried changing the rotationX to 252 and the rotationY to 1020 and still no luck. Both the wing wear and drop .dat file are in my raw folder in the cache
case 20091:
itemDef.modelid = 60003;
itemDef.modelZoom = 849;
itemDef.modelRotationX = 138;
itemDef.modelRotationY = 267;
itemDef.modelOffset1 = -1;
itemDef.modelOffset2 = 24;
itemDef.stackable = false;
itemDef.value = 1;
itemDef.membersObject = true;
itemDef.anInt165 = 60002;
itemDef.anInt200 = 60002;
itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
itemDef.itemActions[4] = &quot;Drop&quot;;
itemDef.editedModelColor = new int[1];
itemDef.newModelColor = new int[1];
itemDef.editedModelColor[0] = 926;
itemDef.newModelColor[0] = 1;
itemDef.name = &quot;Saradomin Wings&quot;;
itemDef.description = &quot;Some Saradomin Wings&quot;;
break;

Sorry i dont know how to put the code into a drop down box, can anyone tell me what i did wrong?</description>
