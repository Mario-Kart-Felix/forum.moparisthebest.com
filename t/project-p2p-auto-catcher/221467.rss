    <description>duno if im allowed to post this here but w/e

[code]Simple auto catcher bot.

Keys:
F5 - Eat Shark
F6 - Autocatcher on/off (last player attacked)
F7 - Attack last player attacked (auto catcher can sometimes be slow to attack so press this button)

Might add auto eat and prayer hot keys later but for now just use F5 to eat shark.[/code]

It isnt keyloged. Ty for the bot Pox, but also the client on Projectp2p got updated. is it hard to update bot?<br>

Decompile then fix errors and compile[/quote]</p>

<p>word. This 1shot kid probably wasn’t even around when rsc got keelled. If jagex couldn’t stop autoing then how are people with crappy RSC SERVERS stopping bots from logging in to the server? If they really wanted to stop autoing, it would have been done. They were just busy with rs2. They did care about reports, that’s how they banned a lot of people. You didn’t play runescape at all, did you even play rs2? You are talking shit about that, and that aint true either you fucking idiot. You never played runescape, gtfo low life.<br>

Just because he knows nothing about java and he doesn’t know you can in fact prevent macroing doesn’t mean he didn’t play the original RSC, I cant even think why you would say something like that?</p>
<p>To 1shot:<br>
Jagex didn’t have to ban all the macroers to prevent it, they just have to create a better anti-cheat system so it detects the bots or doesn’t let people even log on to bots on the server.[/quote]<br>
Listen to him, “they didn’t even try”? That’s a class A example of a failed attempt.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">RSC was abandoned, and then came the autoers</span>. Pick up a book, read a tutorial or two and start learning Java. RSC private server <span class="bbcode-b">DEVELOPMENT</span> is more or less dead. The only “real” server I’ve seen is HixkPK/EnvyOnline(Although not RSCD). There’s a fucking amazing RSC private server base public (RSCD for the people that didn’t catch on). It’s a lot further then any RS2 private server I’ve seen around and I still dare to say RS2 private server <span class="bbcode-b">DEVELOPMENT</span> is a lot more advanced then ours.</p>
<p>Now instead of crying about something you CANNOT change anyways [as in, people will not stop writing bots because you cry], try picking up a book and learn and <span class="bbcode-b">develop</span>.</p>

First off, Jagex could of stopped the autoers if they even bothered, they were just too busy creating a newer and more advanced version of their game. Second, what Peter said SHOULD be what is happening, but I believe 95% of the servers posted on this site are the people just trying to get “e-rep” or make a few bucks off creating a private server. I assume this server is part of he 95% of servers who’s creator cant do anything outside the XML part of the source…</p>
