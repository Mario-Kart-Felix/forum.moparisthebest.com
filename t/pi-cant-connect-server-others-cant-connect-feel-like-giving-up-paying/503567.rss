    <title>[PI]Can&#39;t Connect Server/Other&#39;s Can&#39;t Connect - Feel like giving up, PAYING</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-cant-connect-server-others-cant-connect-feel-like-giving-up-paying/503567</link>
    <description>Really feel like giving up, I&#39;ve been at this for 12 hours now.

Used the normal client - others can&#39;t connect because of loading problems
Downloaded new clients - error connecting even though i changed all ports/ip

Really not in the mood for this bs anymore, someone else just scammed me aswell for $10 as they said they would help me.

I really need help - Add me on Skype - Deathly_Wish - Stirling/Hamza

Paying through paypal</description>
