              <p>its 40% im aware but its not my fault though is the point, ive let it drop below because it wasn’t 24-7 till yesterday and i wanted to keep 100% uptime forever, but it glitched out which wasn’t my fault though which is my reason</p>

              <p>No the only way to get you’re server uptime up is too let it fall the below 60% (or whatever the value is) and wait for it to get deleted so you can re-list it. Or you could wait for it to round back up to 99.9 which would take exceptionally longer.</p>
