    <title>Chrysler/Dodge congratulations on making the automaker shitlist</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chrysler-dodge-congratulations-on-making-the-automaker-shitlist/392322</link>
    <description>Just got my annual consumer reports best &amp; worst cars of 2011 to find (no suprise) chrysler at the very bottom in automaker ratings.

In the reccommended vehichle section almost all the acura&#39;s are recommended, almost all hyundai&#39;s, almost all the infiniti&#39;s, etc.. which all just happen to be jap and korean, but no chrystlers were recommended, no jeeps were recommended, and the only dodge that was recommended was the dodge ram and the reliability was only average. On a sidenote ford did pretty well. But even with GM&#39;s government bailout they are second to last.

But of course they could be wrong even though its based on more than 1.3 million reports.

<p>Oh I agree with that. If i were looking for a ‘classic’, I wouldn’t be looking in Japan’s catalog of cars. It’d have to be European or American for that.</p>
<p>Japanese cars have never really had the style.</p>

              <p>Well, before I put any faith in any studies, I’d have to know judging criteria, test methods, whether any tests are funded or influenced by a manufacturer, if the judges have any bias, etc etc.</p>
<p>What I know from personal experience is my 1989 S10’s engine blew at 312,000 miles, I put in a new engine and it is still running strong, and basically my newest vehicle is a 1992 Dodge D300 which runs excellent as well.  I also mow grass every week, run a bush hog, plow a garden, and use a front-end loader on a 1951 Ford 8n tractor.  On a daily basis I see many 80s and before American cars being used as daily drivers, but almost never do I see foreign cars from the 80s.  I’m not talking about rare early mercedes and jaguars from the 60s that have been restored, but when was the last time you saw a 85 honda or toyota on the road? My friend bought a mid-90s toyota in high school and it lasted 2 months.  Another friend has a Hyundai he got new in 2005ish, and since then it has had 2 new engines and one transmission put in it due to problems, along with various air conditioning and brake problems as well.  I’ve also done my fair share of work on various cars, and American ones are ALWAYS easier to work on.  Nissan for example has an engine design where the oil filter is INSIDE the motor, that’s always nice…</p>
<p>So you’ll forgive me if I disagree when morons in suits prefer a Honda over a Dodge.</p>

<p>Chrysler: Now selling more lemons than India!</p>
<p>The results seem extremely accurate to me, I just purchased my second honda (Acura) with over 100,000 miles on it and have been driving it around with absolutely no problems while my neighbor across the street constantly has problems with his chrysler 200, he then made a comment to my grandfather the other day that he thinks its bullshit how a teenager in high school has a better car than him (him being around 50) though the funny thing is I only paid about half of what he paid and got a better looking/more reliable vehicle.</p>
<p>Lucky this thing came out to undone any damage that the US government did by taking a couple situations where toyotas had the pedal stuck and blow the whole thing out of proportion even though its happened to many american vehicles before.</p>

              <p>Just got my annual consumer reports best &amp; worst cars of 2011 to find (no suprise) chrysler at the very bottom in automaker ratings.</p>
<p>In the reccommended vehichle section almost all the acura’s are recommended, almost all hyundai’s, almost all the infiniti’s, etc… which all just happen to be jap and korean, but no chrystlers were recommended, no jeeps were recommended, and the only dodge that was recommended was the dodge ram and the reliability was only average. On a sidenote ford did pretty well. But even with GM’s government bailout they are second to last.</p>
<p>But of course they could be wrong even though its based on more than 1.3 million reports.</p>
