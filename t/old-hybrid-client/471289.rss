    <title>Old Hybrid Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/old-hybrid-client/471289</link>
    <description>I had Hybrid Pvp v3 client just laying on my desktop. Never worked for me and I&#39;ve been trying to download the client for awhile now but its not working. 
I guess the link is broken. 

Judge me all you want about how I don&#39;t have permission do re-upload a broken link or w/e Just trying to be kind and release the stuff I don&#39;t need or our source.

I also have Pur3zScape 508. I was like dang! This pc was in storage for about 2 years and just now getting it out. 

But yeah. 

Heres Hybrid.
