    <title>Server wont stay on my computer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-wont-stay-on-my-computer/386654</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to download a source.
Everytime I download it, it goes to my desktop and then it gets deleted.
I tried saving the .rar and extracting it manually instead of having it automatically do it.
It just deletes the .rar off of my desktop too?
I thought it was my av, microsoft sercurity essentials, deleting them on its own since it thinks theres a virus in it.
But ive downloaded this source multiple times and never had my av automatically delete it.
So i dont think it is my av deleting it.
But then what is?</description>
