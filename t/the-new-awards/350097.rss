    <title>The new awards</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-new-awards/350097</link>
    <description>Me, I do not deserve any awards this is being spoken for other people have put hard work into writing tutorials, and help people.

What happened to these awards, they aren&#39;t being handed out. And yes people do deserve them. I know its only a picture on your computer, but still, everything on the computer is just a picture.

[/quote]isnt it the same with the java award…[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, java has to be kinda learned, model making, you can either do it or you can’t.  Some of the guys read my tutorial and they’re straight off modelling complex models, some take a while to get into it.</p>

You obviously <span class="bbcode-b">don’t</span> have an idea as to how the awards work. As it has been said before, the motivation on this site has been incredibly low in the past year or so. In order to raise this moral, these awards were developed. Although it’s a little conniving, the awards are a way to get the members of this forum to work harder. It was <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> made for their skill, but made in order to expand their skill that they’re <span class="bbcode-b">lacking</span>.</p>
<p>Perhaps everyone would be more content if we changed the title of that cup. Obviously no one deserves such a <span class="bbcode-i">high standard</span> titled award such as “JAVA Co0Dar”. In all of your attempts to make everyone feel undeserving and belittled, you haven’t made your self look any better. The title of the award is obviously low for standard’s sake, but you’re putting it out as if it’s as close as you can get to java guru.</p>
