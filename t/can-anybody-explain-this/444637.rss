    <description>hi i have been making a webclient for my forums.

i have made a client.jar that works and downloads my cache. i had uploaded it to dropbox / public and i have used a correct html code but the problem im having is when i go to the webclient it asks me if to run java and i click yes then it just goes white and doesnt load then a little error comes up at the top.
