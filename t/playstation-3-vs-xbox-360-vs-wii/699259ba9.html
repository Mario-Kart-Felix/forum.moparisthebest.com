tbh, PSN is shit. yeah, it’s free, but it’s shit. all it does is invite more spoiled kids, paying for XBL gives me some maturity, at least.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I would of agreed with you, a year ago. But now psn has had a good few updates which has brought the bar up to close behind xbox live and with all the planned updates it will soon be on par with xbox live.</p>
<p>As far as online in-game play, it is just as good, there are never any connection issues or anything like that if there is then its down to the game not playstation network.</p>
<p>Come to think of it though, there is not much setting xbox live and psn apart now as it is, as far as i can see anyway. As far as you saying xbox live is more mature then i’d have to disagree, i’m not saying either are more mature than the other but as the ps3 still has a higher price it usually is older players you find online.</p>
<p>Like i said though, a year ago psn was utter shit compared to xbox live, but now - and i’ll ask you to give me some things that makes xbox live better psn, i’ll name one though now, xbox live has a better sense of community compared to psn which is supposed to change with playstation home and such… we’ll see.[/quote]well, i’ve only played my ps3 a handful of times, since then all it does is sit on my stand, next to my xbox360 elite. even though the ps3 cost more, it doesn’t mean parents wouldn’t buy it for their spoiled children. the xbox360 has XBL, which cost a little extra, but connects you with millions, and kicks out all the kids who want to join for free. sure, we have kids like these: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G143bHweAY" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G143bHweAY</a>, but i see a lot less of them outside of Halo.</p>

<p>Wrong. It comes in 20, 40, 60, and 80GB models. Specifically speaking in the US (but most likely a fact for most other countries as well), the 20GB and 60GB models are no longer built and shipped off to stores for shipping. The 60GB model is the best when it comes to backwards compatibility with PS2 games, but the only way to get one nowadays is to buy one off the net for <span class="bbcode-i">more than the 80GB model.</span> As the 40 and 80GB models are the only ones available in stores in the US (as far as I know), the 80GB model is usually picked (for a mere 100 USD or 67 EURO more) as that specific model can be considered a gaming device AND a media device.
