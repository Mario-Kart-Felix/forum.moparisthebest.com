<p>Wrong. It comes in 20, 40, 60, and 80GB models. Specifically speaking in the US (but most likely a fact for most other countries as well), the 20GB and 60GB models are no longer built and shipped off to stores for shipping. The 60GB model is the best when it comes to backwards compatibility with PS2 games, but the only way to get one nowadays is to buy one off the net for <span class="bbcode-i">more than the 80GB model.</span> As the 40 and 80GB models are the only ones available in stores in the US (as far as I know), the 80GB model is usually picked (for a mere 100 USD or 67 EURO more) as that specific model can be considered a gaming device AND a media device. This is so because the 80GB model has three extra input slots for a memory stick, SD memory card, and CompactFlash (CF) card.</p>

tbh, PSN is shit. yeah, it’s free, but it’s shit. all it does is invite more spoiled kids, paying for XBL gives me some maturity, at least.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I would of agreed with you, a year ago. But now psn has had a good few updates which has brought the bar up to close behind xbox live and with all the planned updates it will soon be on par with xbox live.</p>
<p>As far as online in-game play, it is just as good, there are never any connection issues or anything like that if there is then its down to the game not playstation network.</p>
<p>Come to think of it though, there is not much setting xbox live and psn apart now as it is, as far as i can see anyway. As far as you saying xbox live is more mature then i’d have to disagree, i’m not saying either are more mature than the other but as the ps3 still has a higher price it usually is older players you find online.</p>
<p>Like i said though, a year ago psn was utter shit compared to xbox live, but now - and i’ll ask you to give me some things that makes xbox live better psn, i’ll name one though now, xbox live has a better sense of community compared to psn which is supposed to change with playstation home and such… we’ll see.[/quote]well, i’ve only played my ps3 a handful of times, since then all it does is sit on my stand, next to my xbox360 elite. even though the ps3 cost more, it doesn’t mean parents wouldn’t buy it for their spoiled children. the xbox360 has XBL, which cost a little extra, but connects you with millions, and kicks out all the kids who want to join for free. sure, we have kids like these: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G143bHweAY" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G143bHweAY</a>, but i see a lot less of them outside of Halo.</p>

<p>I would of agreed with you, a year ago. But now psn has had a good few updates which has brought the bar up to close behind xbox live and with all the planned updates it will soon be on par with xbox live.</p>
<p>As far as online in-game play, it is just as good, there are never any connection issues or anything like that if there is then its down to the game not playstation network.</p>
<p>Come to think of it though, there is not much setting xbox live and psn apart now as it is, as far as i can see anyway. As far as you saying xbox live is more mature then i’d have to disagree, i’m not saying either are more mature than the other but as the ps3 still has a higher price it usually is older players you find online.</p>
<p>Like i said though, a year ago psn was utter shit compared to xbox live, but now - and i’ll ask you to give me some things that makes xbox live better psn, i’ll name one though now, xbox live has a better sense of community compared to psn which is supposed to change with playstation home and such… we’ll see.</p>

Xbox 360 online = extreme quality and satisfying game play + service. What you get for Xbox Live is totally worth the price.</p>
<p>Whereas I’ve heard many complaints about the PS3’s online service being incomparable to the 360’s.<br>
I’m not all for these debate topics. Different people have different tastes, there is no perfect console, just let people get what they want.</p>
<p>And, i agree with Lothy. I hardly notice any different in graphics. It’s just how the game is designed, too; they might have not payed attention to major details.</p>
<p>But, for me, Xbox 360. Get new remotes, playstation. (N)</p>

I’ll go for the Xbox 360, again.</p>
<p>There’s little if any noticeable difference in the graphics. <span class="bbcode-b">That’s almost as bad as someone saying that you should have songs with a higher bitrate, even though you can’t hear the difference.</span></p>
<p>Secondly, the original Xbox was home to several games that I enjoyed a lot - Fable, the original Halo, and so on.<br>
I’ve always enjoyed the game play I get from Xbox games.</p>
<p>On another note, the Xbox 360 is sleek too.</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
Offtopic, but that’s bullshit. I can definitely hear the difference between a 96 kbps song and a 320 kb/s song, even with my headphones.</p>
<p>Get a better audio system =P. It’s like saying “don’t buy a flat screen monitor, because it’s no better than a non-flat.” You shouldn’t make assumptions only because you can’t see/hear the difference.</p>
<p>Ontopic: My friend just got his ps3, I’ll rate it soon after playing a bit.[/quote]<br>
I was thinking more 192kbps vs 320kbps. Personally, I don’t really hear the difference. Maybe I’m going deaf at 17. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>Hmm… Looking at the above post-and seeing as you, Mr.Chris don’t have a ps3 yet but defending it with your life;<br>
The graphics of the Xbox360 are easily seen, great-clear, on any television.<br>
On the ps3, you req. HD television to see something similar to 360’s graphics.<br>
Besides, they stoped production of the ps3 because of too many bugs and flaws.<br>
Mis well get it as soon as you can, in about 6 months-1year, its gonna be worth alot.<br>
The blue light thing in ps3 is the only real feature I like about it, it provides a great picture when I watch movies with it. But thats the only real thing I like about it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

<p>Erm, before you post here, can you actually find out what your talking about? Also, learn to layout your paragraphs properly.</p>
<p>Secondly, what are you talking about? You do not need a HDTV to match the Xbox graphics. Also, just because I don’t have one, doesn’t mean I haven’t played it.</p>
<p>The blue light thing? You mean blu-ray. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/open_mouth.png?v=6" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"> I’m not even replying to the rest of that post.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Acaully i find the Graphics better even when i tried it on a pc monitor… Ps3 has 3x better graphics its 2x more powerfull</p>
<p>Like i said i do have both and am always comparing them but ps3 stays the best and stays my favourite[/quote]<br>
You have broken eyes.</p>

PS3 also has a core and premium version - 20GB and 60GB<br>
The standard one everyone buys is the 60 GB premium one though, the one which i got today <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
[/quote]<br>
20gb PS3s were “limited edition” and are now discontinued in the NTSC regions\never released in PAL (EU, etc)<br>
btw starblaster, did you get any of those 46" Bravias or a copy of Resistance?[/quote]</p>
<p>whats 46" Bravias?<br>
Yes i got Resistance<br>
20 GB ones are still being sold in UK, i’ve seen them around</p>
