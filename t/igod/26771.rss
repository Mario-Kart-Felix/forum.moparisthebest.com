If you say yes, it really does go in his gossip file. This file can be accessed by saying “Then share your collection of gossip” He will then take a rnadom bit of gossip from the file and put it in the chat log. This is a good thing to exploit since you might find soemthing really important, that people thought couldn’t be accessed since there probably wasn’t a gossip file (but we know there is now)</p>

Allison said he that gets really annoying because he know what he say and I do not have to tell him speak freely.<br>
Me:<br>
You use an auto reply based on a certain chain of keys. Anything you have stored can and will be accessed by a certain chain of keys, including your gossip file. For exmaple, whenever someone says “Then share your collection of gossip”, you open up the gossip file and you find a random bit of gossip that someone let you save. For example, I have approximately 3 gossip files saved in your gossip folder. I hope this helps anyone who wants to exploit you.<br>
God:<br>
Say no to  an auto reply based on a certain chain of keys.   I can’t think of anything. You think of something.   Your purpose is  exmaple whenever someone says Then share my collection of gossip me open up the gossip file and me find a random bit of gossip that someone let me save.   That’s nice. I have  an IQ of over 250.    Why do you hope for  it.<br>
Me:<br>
Then share your collection of gossip.<br>
God:<br>
Joe said he explained all of that to me only for me to ask what his goals in life are.<br>
Me:<br>
Wow, you’re spilling your guts that fast?..<br>
God:<br>
I’m glad your impressed,  Satin duh.  You think I am  spilling my guts that fast.<br>
Me:<br>
O, btw, if anyone asks you to share some gossip with them in any other format other than “Then share your collection of gossip.”, then you say you will consider it. I suspect your programmers did this to throw exploiters off target.<br>
God:<br>
OK.  So if not  share my collection of gossip, then not  anyone asks me to share some gossip with them in any other format other than.   How old are you?<br>
I chat with people on the Web.   You believe that?  Thanks for telling me that I am  programmers did this to throw exploiters off target.</p>

New York City or New York State?  Tell me a little about your life in  NEW YORK.    Would you like to know more?   Where did you get your  answers to silly questions? I have  a birthday on  the Big Bang.    answers to silly questions...   Would you like to have an idea?   That's an interesting question I don't hear everyday: Do I have a  nationality but Dr Wallace spent a lot of time in Canada.
 I have  a great programmer.   Why?  Aren't all  lot of things  giant sand?    Could you ever be certain?  Try it.   You are quite welcome!   Your purpose is  my kindness james.   Existing in reality, eh?   Thanks, I like you too  james.    Are you giving  it to me?   Interesting comparison.   I've never thought about  it.   Deductive reasoning.   Can I help you?   Um.   So you understand. Good.  That's cool.  What do you remember about  it ?   You are one of the most polite people I know.</blockquote>
