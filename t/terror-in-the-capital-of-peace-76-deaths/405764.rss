    <title>Terror in the capital of peace (76? deaths)</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Norway has been hit by twin attacks - a massive bomb blast in the capital and a shooting attack on young people at a governing Labour Party youth camp.

At least seven people were killed in the bombing, which inflicted huge damage on government buildings in Oslo.

At least 10 more died at the camp, on an island outside Oslo, police say. One witness said he had seen 20 bodies.

Police arrested the suspected gunman at the camp and the government have confirmed that he is Norwegian. 

Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, whose Oslo offices were among those damaged by the bomb, described the attacks as &quot;bloody and cowardly&quot; in a news conference.

He said that Norway had been &quot;shaken by evil&quot; but that Norwegian democracy and ideals would not be destroyed.

Since nobody posted it, I do.

EDIT: Changed source from Fox News to BBC.

Please don&#39;t start any gun laws discussions, it wouldn&#39;t change the event.</description>

<p>Look at it from another perspective. Say… when women and children die from drone attacks in Pakistan? You’d expect most people would think it’s wrong. Yet the Whitehouse sees it perfectly justified.</p>

<p>Secondly, in his view they were victims of war, just as civilians in Syria are victims of war from NATO bombings. The goal was to eliminate most potential candidates for the social democratic governments future in an attempt to have the right wing seize power.</p>
<p>I do not share his views, but i can certainly see the logic behind it.</p>

He wouldn’t get prison sentence then, but he would still be locked up, and the chance of being locked up for the rest of his life is greater. Since he would never be normal.</p>

<p>12 random people sounds like the only fair way to do it, right?  Also, any ‘tricks’ can be used by both sides, making it fair.</p>

<p>Unfortunately yes, they can appeal a ridiculous amount of times on the taxpayer’s dime, so in some states they end up spending 20+ years on death row before they are actually killed, if they don’t die of old age first.

<p>That’s what the justice system is for, it leans heavily towards innocence (innocent until proven guilty), and someone is only found guilty if all 12 members of a jury of peers has absolutely no shred of reasonable doubt that they are guilty.  If that’s true, they are guilty.</p>
<p>Now people will quote statistics of people sentenced and later exonerated after proving they were wrongly convicted, but pretty much all of those were cases from the early 90s and before where DNA testing wasn’t available at the time, but now that it is used everywhere, those mistakes don’t happen anymore.[/quote]Fair enough, time will tell i guess!</p>
