    <description>I turned on my ps3, went into gta, and found myself at my eastern apartment on the middle island (because of quick save). Anyways, I go outside and see tons of cars lined up. i go to the front and see a car in near perfect condition (the hood had a little bit of smoke coming out of it and was smashed in the middle) with [b]no bullet holes or broken glass[/b] and two dead guys inside. How is this possible? Also, it caused people to say &quot;That&#39;s horrible!&quot; and walk by weirdly. It also made Nico do some odd things with his hands...</description>
