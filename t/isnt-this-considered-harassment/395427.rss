    <title>Isnt this considered harassment?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/isnt-this-considered-harassment/395427</link>
    <description>Alright so wrench_king and i live far far away from spawn, so we could get away from griefers and raiders.

My problem is tom_beta and xx matty xx have made a compound in proximity to ours for the sole purpose of raiding our settlement.

One or 2 raids wouldnt be against the rules but they have attempted to raid us atleast 20+ times, no matter how many times i kill them they keep coming back, everytime i kill them they start go say things like &quot;umad!&quot; &quot;madmadmad&quot; and then proceed to try to start an argument.

Wouldnt this fall under the level of harassment?</description>

              <p>If anything, this sounds like a case of extreme faggotry. I don’t like how Tom_BETA always goes ‘too bad, the rule wasn’t there before I did <span class="bbcode-i">x</span>, so if action was taken against me, it’s unfair’. Case in point: his monument in Davidi2’s empire.</p>
<p>I’d also like to quote a paragraph from the current server rules:</p>
<blockquote>The staff reserve the right to interpret these rules any way they see fit. The following rules are more like guidelines. You shouldn't be looking for loopholes in them, rather, you should just get along with them. We're looking for users that use common sense. For example, we would prefer a user that knows, just because something isn't on the rules, that it it isn't necessarily allowed.</blockquote>
This was added to the rules because of a discussion I had with Davidi2. I received a temporary ban from the server because of an edited image of IRC chat logs (which didn't exist in the rules).
<p>If all of badger41’s claims was true, Tom_BETA and Magma828 were indeed harassing him. To me you don’t build a house without knowing that it’s really close to someone’s, discover its existence, break a few blocks to enter it (without the owner’s permission) and start raiding the chests. While raiding chests isn’t breaking any of the rules, griefing in order to raid chests should be.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this conflict has already been solved, but that’s just my 2 cents’ worth. Any op should handle this matter  about doing something that is wrong, but isn’t explicitly stated in the rules.</p>
<p>So I put forward a few rules:<br>
No griefing in order to enter someone’s compound. <span class="bbcode-i">The person has already put in effort to protect his home, breaking a few blocks and placing them back after entering it should be an offense. What is the point of home protection then?</span></p>
<p>No houses should be built in proximity to someone else’s without permission.</p>

<p>Its rediculous that they are so defensive in atitude on the situation. Imo, as matty just mentioned blocks all of a sudden, I would think he has a guilty gut about something. Either way tho, 65 blocks is.too ficking close not to notice anything. Especially if one base is underground it seems like a hope to hide out, not by chance.</p>

<p>And you are allowed to break just enough blocks to get into someones area but if you start to break many blocks its griefing.</p>

</aside>
<p>And yes, building our house underground <span class="bbcode-i">was</span> a “hope to hide out”. All of our houses have been underground to reduce the number of times we get griefed/raided.</p>
<p>We’re being defensive because there need to be clear rules on things like this. If 65 blocks is too close, then there should be an actual rule about it. If you’re not allowed to raid a person multiple times, then there should be a rule about that too.</p>

<p>That’s not understandable.</p>
<p>Either way using set numbers is a stupid idea, why does every rule have to be a complete mess? You’re now going to have people counting blocks in every direction to ensure they’re allowed to build there. You then have spacing issues, if someone counts 200 blocks in 1 direction and someone else’s house is 150 blocks away from there they can’t build there.</p>
<p>People will make mistakes, and will have their property removed which isn’t good at all. A quick solution would be to stop the moaning because you’re being raided.</p>

              <p>Please prove we moved there with the intention to just raid you. If that was the case I would of chosen a better location that’s for sure. And as matty said you all yet again assume everyone plays on far render, I play on tiny. Also as Badger said there is a hill meaning seeing his house wasn’t possible.</p>
<p>If 65 block is to close then I guess you need to start knocking down a ton of houses? The lack of clearance on this rule (Since Lin left) has been pathetic. I offered friendly relations, if you don’t want them then I suggest you say so.</p>
<p>Everything myself and matty have done was strictly within the rules, and none of you have proven otherwise. This topic is a last ditch attempt to strike back, nothing more.</p>

              <p>Its rediculous that they are so defensive in atitude on the situation. Imo, as matty just mentioned blocks all of a sudden, I would think he has a guilty gut about something. Either way tho, 65 blocks is.too ficking close not to notice anything. Especially if one base is underground it seems like a hope to hide out, not by chance.</p>
