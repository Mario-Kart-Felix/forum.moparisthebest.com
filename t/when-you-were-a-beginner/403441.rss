    <description>How did you learn to start Java? And why did you? Why was it so interesting?

My answer:

I learned Java by basically reading my server codes.. It took about a year to get the hang of it, but I am still learning. I wanted to learn Java, because I knew that was the language RSPS&#39;s came in.

<p>I never bashed anything. I was just stating that C# is basically, and again, literally, Microsoft’s attempt at a Java-like language. It was simply a response to your “Java is a terrible language”, since C# operates in the same manner.</p>
<p>They’re both, in my eyes, functionally equivalent.<br>
[/quote]C# has more features than Java, and I gave one of my reasons as to why java is a terrible language.</p>

</aside>
<p>What IDE do you use for C#?<br>
I know a bit of the language from when I was on windows with microsofts visual studio. Would be nice to take another look.[/quote]When I’m on windows, I use Microsoft Visual C#, on linux MonoDevelop.</p>
<p>[quote=“Shadowspkin, post:40, topic:403441”]C# im pretty sure is quicker thats why people like it better, also runs smoother as Evil demonstrated that there is less line of code.[/quote]Depends on what you’re doing, honestly the only thing that I’d use Java for instead of C# is stuff to do with hacking java games, because it would be easier than creating glue for JNI.</p>
<p>Also, another good thing about C#, you can load methods from a DLL, but said DLL doesn’t have to be formatted any certain way as it does with Java, which means you can literally take a DLL and just create a C# wrapper for it.  In java, you’d have to create a wrapper for that DLL with your own DLL, with methods that conform to “Java_BLeh_Meh_Method(…)” then create the wrapper in java for that.</p>

I never bashed anything. I was just stating that C# is basically, and again, literally, Microsoft’s attempt at a Java-like language. It was simply a response to your “Java is a terrible language”, since C# operates in the same manner.</p>

What IDE do you use for C#?<br>
I know a bit of the language from when I was on windows with microsofts visual studio. Would be nice to take another look.</p>

<p>Pretty much, they had J# then Sun complained so they just made their own language.</p>
<p>But honestly, “It’s Microsoft’s Java” is a REALLY fucking bad reason to “hate” a language, especially if you are on windows.</p>
<p>and if you want to throw up the “C# doesn’t work on linux” argument, I’m on linux and I use C# all the time, hell one of the more well-known music players on linux, Banshee,  is written in C#</p>
