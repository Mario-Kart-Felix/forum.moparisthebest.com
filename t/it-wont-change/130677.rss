    <title>It wont change</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/it-wont-change/130677</link>
    <description>Ok, i have literally tryed everything. I mean everything. But still i cannot seem to make it so what i type in actually changes on the server. For instance, i made a fr33scape server, and it said thug life was offline, well thats not me, so i went and changed it, nothing happens. The only things ive seemed to be able to change were the rules menu and making people admins or mods. I figured that to make these changes for the other things were to compile it. I tryed that, said i needed to download something java related, which i did, still says i need to...But basically ive tryed EVERYTHING. Can someone please help me.[br][size=1]Posted on: August 05, 2007, 08:19:35 PM[/size][hr]If anyone knows i would highly appreciate it.</description>

              <p>Download JDK6u2 from here:<br>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a><br>
Then install it.</p>
<p>Then replace what you have in your compiler with this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">@echo off
color 0c
title Client Compiler
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_02\bin\javac" *.java
pause</code></pre>
<p>Then edit the files and make the changes, and make sure you compile. You have to compile because compiling makes updated .class files, which is what the server runs off of.</p>
