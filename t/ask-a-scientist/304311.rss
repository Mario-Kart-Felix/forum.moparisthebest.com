    <title>Ask A Scientist</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ask-a-scientist/304311</link>
    <description>While researching on the Internet for my Science homework I found a website which helped me a lot on my Science homework in which you can get an answer to your questions via real scientists. 

The homepage: http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/ ~ All the information about the service is given here.

There is an archive section where all the 20,000 odd previous questions answered are categorised into their respective topics and are there for people to refer to before they ask a question as a notification if the question has already been answered and as a learning centre itself although this categorisation is not in alphabetical order which makes it a little difficult to find the question you are after.

The archives can be found through a link on the homepage and there is no need for signing up if you have a question you want answered.</description>
