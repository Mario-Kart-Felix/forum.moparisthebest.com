    <title>Moparscape 3.2 aryan client closes while starting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-3-2-aryan-client-closes-while-starting/553908</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if this is the right section to post this in, so sorry if it&#39;s the wrong one.

So me and my friends recently thought we&#39;d try to get a moparscape server up for us to play around with and test things, however as the title says, the moparscape 3.2 aryan client closes itself while starting up and I can&#39;t seem to find any solutions to it. The same thing happens for both of them, and on my second PC. I also have no idea why it works on my gaming PC, I did download it back in 2012, so you&#39;d think it might just be that some update broke it, but there has been no updates since like 2008 and I&#39;ve also seen people saying that you need Java 5 for it to work, although I&#39;ve never had Java 5 on that PC. It&#39;s running Windows 7 tho, my other PC is running Linux whilst one of my friends PC&#39;s are running Windows 8 and the other one is running Windows 10.</description>
