    <description>[code=java]public synchronized void doSomething() {
   ...
}[/code]

[code=java]public void doSomething() {
   synchronized(this) {
      ...
   }
}[/code]

wouldn&#39;t both of those prevent multiple threads from accessing the &quot;...&quot; part of the code at the same time?</description>

perfect, just the explanation I was looking for thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
