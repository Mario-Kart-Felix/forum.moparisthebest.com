    <title>Web-based item list (includes demo) (with item searching!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/web-based-item-list-includes-demo-with-item-searching/471047</link>
    <description>Hey. I wrote a web-based item list that includes item searching. It lists 22 results per page and it has backwards and forwards page traversing. It has an installer and it allows for &quot;close&quot; matches (for example, if you type in Rune you will get Rune Longsword, Rune Platebody, Mind Rune, etc).

To install it, extract all the files from the .zip file into a folder. Then, modify the config.php to your site&#39;s database information and upload all the files (three .php files and one .sql file) to your site. Visit www.whatever.com/install.php and let it install. After the installation has finished, delete the install.php (this [b]must[/b] be done for security reasons) and if you like delete the install.sql file too (this isn&#39;t a necessity). After this, visit www.whatever.com/itemlist.php and have fun.

The itemlist.php file included in the download is [b]not[/b] styled! It took me around 2 minutes to integrate it into my site as in the demo and so it isn&#39;t hard. However, if anyone is having issues with it, feel free to PM me and I&#39;ll get round to helping.

</aside>
<p>There’s only around 20,000 rows in the item database. There are 2,998,035 posts on the MoparScape forum, which means that there are 2,998,035 rows for posts <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> - 20,000 rows is not a lot <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

That would involve the use of JavaScript which I’m not too keen on using because it can result in breakages if the end user doesn’t have JavaScript enabled.</p>
