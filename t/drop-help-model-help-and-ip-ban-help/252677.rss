    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/drop-help-model-help-and-ip-ban-help/252677</link>
    <description>Ok 3 questions......

1. Can sum1 please tell me EVERYTHING I need to add to get a drop to work? (npcdrops.cfg, item2.java ect)   I keep trying and failing with drops..

2. How do you know what zoom to use with models added by using a model grabber? I want to add elite and dagonhai but dont know zoom.

3. I used the IP ban thingy in server.java where it automaticlly IP bans ppl if they give more then 1 connection. However, sumtime ppls client lagg them out but they are still logged in. They  hit log in again and it says &quot;You acc is already logged in&quot;. It counts that as a connection and they get IP banned. So i removed the auto IPBan. Now I get many SYI ppl.. Please help!</description>
