              <p>I had a yahoo mail account that got completely deleted because I didn’t use it. It simply let me register the account again from scratch.</p>
<p>I also had a BT yahoo mail account that stopped me from logging in, and had to call BT for a new password. I guess yahoo sometimes does strange shit with their accounts, especially the older ones.</p>
