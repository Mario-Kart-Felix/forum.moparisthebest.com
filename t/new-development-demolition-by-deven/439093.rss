    <description>Hello Moparscape!
                        I joined mopar a while ago and learned alongside the best of the coders with their help. I have been spoonfed which seemed great then but turned out to help me a lot. I will be developing my own game called Demolition. Demolition will be a game such as Evony but with a twist of Runescape. As you may know the Evony interfaces are shown as these:

My goal is to create a game with similar interfaces but allow players to move in a Runescape- Like interface throughout cities and add gatherings along with other runescape twists. For example I own CITY-1 you could use an option on the map to walk to my city and see it in a runescape interface and walk throughout it. I will also try to add battle interfaces so you and friends could make alliance or tribes and assist each other in multiplayer battle interfaces sort of like a clan battle in Runescape.
I will be creating a developing team soon.
To apply please fill out this below application and show me some interface ideas and show me that you are capable coding outside of Runescape Private Servers.

It sounds quite interesting, hoping you can find people who are able to help you out, just hoping you know enough yourself to make a game!</p>
