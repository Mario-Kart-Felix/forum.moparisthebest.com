              <p>Rofl kinda sounds like your a noob from when you said " you go first unless you have 300+ rep or are a moderator "</p>
<p>first id like to say you cannot have over 200 reputation, so that leaves you looking like a novice right there.<br>
second most moderators dont do this type stuff for the players, tons of people want their help lol.</p>
<p>anyway goodluck…</p>
