    <title>[RSCDv25] How to make NPC attack you after some event?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscdv25-how-to-make-npc-attack-you-after-some-event/239620</link>
    <description>It&#39;s just a little request - what do I need to add to rangeEvent.java to make NPC attack you after you shoot him/her? Or atleast be focused on you, if there was an obstacle on the way. Or is there some other file that needs to be modified? I would appreciate if you gave me var&#39;s name/function. I am learning, but don&#39;t have a clue, what needs to be done currently.

Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>Take a look at model/Mob.java, look at updatePosition() - think that’s the method, cba to look.</p>
<p>You’ll see how to move a Mob to a specific place. Then take a look further down for where it finds a victim and attacks them.</p>
<p>You should be able to cobble something together. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
