    <title>How to detect numbers only in a string/integer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-detect-numbers-only-in-a-string-integer/184827</link>
    <description>Okay so to finish off my source I am trying to do some error trapping, I need to make it so a person only enters letters in a string or only numbers in an integer variable or w.e. I tried making a string and returning the values to check if they were there but I couldn&#39;t use it properly, so can anyone please help?

I would like the thing to be something like:

[code]

static final blah blah blah allowedLetters = &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;; // or w.e its suppose to be

[/code]

and then I realize there should be a boolean here that checks if things are only what they should be in allowedLetters and returns a value to match it? storing a true or a false?

and than I would like to bring that value and use it in my main void:
something like  
[code]if ( X matches allowedLetters) 
{
}
else{
blah blah blah}[/code]

all the help (if any) appreciated.

I know its not the most effective way to do this but its my first time thinking about doing it. So basically I just want to make it so if a person inputs a number in the string it would give and error and go back and re ask the question.[/b][/i][/u]</description>
