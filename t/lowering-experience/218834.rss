    <title>Lowering experience</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lowering-experience/218834</link>
    <description>I know this is a tutorial because I have seen it before, but it&#39;s been a while since I have needed it. I have looked everywhere (almost) in my source for where I change the experience gained for doing whatever and I can not find it. I also tried using the search, but I am not sure what to search for. So, where is the link that will help me edit my skills?

Oh, and what&#39;s an illegal escape character? I got this error from compiling.

(Thanks)

No flaming, please, as I have tried to search for this already.</description>
