    <description>[b]I really need to think of a shorter name.
ANYWAYS![/b]
The goal is to make a really awesome server with loads of content and things to do.
So far I have made ideas for about 18 quests, 82 custom items, 2 random events, and 2 possible spawn setups.
When I found out that I was NOT going to be able to code and design these things by myself. After alot of crying and ragequit I post this.

I need people to fill in the following spots:
2x coders
1x modelers
3x admins
5x beta testers/debuggers
1x content designers

Here is what I am doing:
2d art
Hosting
Server protecting
Main content development
Moderating
Customer support
Marketing
Management
Content managing

Payment:
Payment will only be received if some one is kind enough to donate and if there is money left after marketing and server repairs.
If that happens payment will be as follows. . .
9% me
16% coders
7% admins
12% modelers
11% content designers
3% beta testers/debuggers
Starting off we will have NO money. So while we aren&#39;t making money in the beginning, we have to make the server profitable.

This will be my 1st major attempt at an rsps DO NOT FLAME! (please  :))

If you want to help please post the following

Xfire username*
What you would like to be called
Email
Job you want
And finally,proof that you can do the job
[b]*You can register for xfire at xfire.com and download. Xfire is what we will be using to communicate. (my username is snowbodys)[/b]

Thanks!</description>
