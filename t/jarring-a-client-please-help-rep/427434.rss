    <title>Jarring a client please help. Rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jarring-a-client-please-help-rep/427434</link>
    <description>Okay, very small problem and I don&#39;t know why it keeps happening... My jar doesnt give me this error but it gives it to everyone else. It says &quot;Cannot find main client.class&quot;. I believe its a problem with me signing the Jar and if anyone can help that would be great! Thanks. If you can do over teamview just PM me. Thanks!</description>
