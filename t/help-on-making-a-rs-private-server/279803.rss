    <title>Help on making a RS private server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-on-making-a-rs-private-server/279803</link>
    <description>I need a bit of help making a private server.

What I have is the RS source files, compiler...

So what I can do is make a server, after that, I have no idea how to connect to that server. I think I may need to download something else which has the run.bat

Well, this is what I did.
I have the TESTscape source. That has all the .java and .class files and such. It also has compile.bat and runserver.bat. Compile runs the code and compiles it, then it goes to runserver.bat and starts up the server. Sometimes I get a could not connect to port 5555. Is it in use? error. I think for that I just need to retry or something. I think I know what to do for that. Then when the server is up, thats when I have the problem. I dont know how to connect to the server.

Is there a download which I can get that has everything in it? thanks

<p>Somewhere in your client files, maybe GUI.java you may find a no-ip server address, change it to your’s and maybe port numbers in your source, only thing I can think of, I’m still trying to get mine up too x.x</p>

</aside>
<p>I dont have the client files. Is there a DL link? Atleast I know there isnt a GUI.java file</p>
<p>Im just wondering, Is there the new version of RS? like the one with summoning and construction?</p>
<p>Also, I tried that mopar website u were talking about pimped, but it didnt work</p>

              <p>Hmm, Go into Server.java, And search 5555; Change 5555 to 43594, Compile.<br>
Then to connect, Just use <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> (The official moparscape client) And just hit login.<br>
I can’t find you a DL link atm. But I’ll try later.</p>
