    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;ve seen someone do it before and he did it in like 1 minute, but how do you change it so monsters wont die like this:

But like withouth all the glitchy stuff, I have a 316 with 597 monsters I beleave. But if you can just tell me how this glitch is called I can probably find a tutorial somewhere on the web, or you can explain to me how to do it that&#39;d be great too!

Thanks allready.</description>

              <p>Yeah, I’m pretty sure it’s in the Source and I know it has to do something with animations, however I really have no idea where to go. Been in NPCHandler.java but can’t quite find it, if anyone has any type of a tip that might help please message below!</p>
