    <title>Action keys when JFrame is off focus</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/action-keys-when-jframe-is-off-focus/276062</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m making a macroer. I think I&#39;ve solved this problem before but I have no idea how I went about it.

So my problem is ending the macroer while it is recording keyboard and mouse input, or stopping the macroer while it is playing back recorded input. In both situations the macroer will be minimized into the system tray.

Any ideas? The Action key I would like to use is something like F12 or CTRL+F12, very common ones.</description>

              <p>I havn’t looked into it alot, but I know there is a library called JInvoke, which uses JNI but makes alot of things much easier for you. The only disadvantage, however, is that I think it only works on Windows (unless they have also included Linux or any other OS into it). But atleast you could maybe look into it, and see if they got a solution for you. Also, I think it costs money, but I am sure you could test it somehow anyway…</p>

<p>As far as I know, you can’t do it without some native library.</p>
