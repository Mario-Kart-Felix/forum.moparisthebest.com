    <title>Unusual Brands. Very Cheap! Work GREAT! (Hiphone, Apad, PXP, and more.)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unusual-brands-very-cheap-work-great-hiphone-apad-pxp-and-more/342415</link>
    <description>Ok so I recently found out about this site called http://www.chinagrabber.com

They have hundreds of rip offs such as the iphone rip called the hiphone. This thing is amazing! I just ordered it and it works great! It looks 100% like the iphone, except on the back instead of it saying iphone there is hiphone. The best part about it was that it only cost me $42.99 with no shipping charge!

I also ordered a PXP. Its a PSP rip off. Again it looks 100% like a psp, but the back logo has PXP and not PSP. It has 32 gigs of memory so you can download roms and play it on the PXP. 11 megapixel camera, mp3, mp4, and mp5 player and so much more. This one cost me $89.99 and so far I havent had any problems with it.

There Ipad rip offs (apad), black berry (black bemy), and all kinds of stuff. If you guys want some really cool shit for hella cheap I suggest going here: http://www.chinagrabber.com .

Here is a pic of my hiphone (brand new still has plastic film on the screen):

And here is a pic of my PXP-2000 (psp go rip):

[u][i][b]I will be ordering more and posting them on this thread as I do![/b][/i][/u]</description>

[/quote]I mean for normal pictures like these. There are two seperate cameras being used, and I doubt there is any reason as to why.[/quote]They were taken on different days. One I was at home, the other I was at my brothers house.</p>
<p>1EDIT: And actually these are the latest look-a-likes, These ones got great reviews. I have not had one problem with the Hiphone or PXP 2000. The Hiphone is very responsive, and has very few differences with the actual Iphone. You don’t have to trust this site if you don’t want to, its your choice, I was just making this topic for those who did want to check out some of their stuff.</p>
<p>2EDIT: Also there are just as many good reviews as bad reviews just like with any site. And I googled some of these reviews myself and almost all the ‘bad’ reviews all said later that chinagrabber fixed the problem.</p>

I’ve seen a YouTube video comparing a real iPod and a fake one, and it said that the Chinese one’s battery actually exploded while it was charging. Aside from that, it was pretty good. Only $25, good memory size, and it had video (was older iPod version,U2 edition).</p>

              <p>They are all generic, its the apad not ipad lol. They work great though. I got the hiphone (iphone rip) and the pxp 2000 (psp go rip), and so far I have no problems. My friend is the one who showed me this site, he buys crap from it all the time.</p>

              <p>Considering the “iPad” is only $229 vs $500, I’d say it’s very cheap. Something’s fishy about this site though…</p>

              <p>Ok so I recently found out about this site called <a href="http://www.chinagrabber.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.chinagrabber.com</a></p>
<p>They have hundreds of rip offs such as the iphone rip called the hiphone. This thing is amazing! I just ordered it and it works great! It looks 100% like the iphone, except on the back instead of it saying iphone there is hiphone. The best part about it was that it only cost me $42.99 with no shipping charge!</p>
<p>I also ordered a PXP. Its a PSP rip off. Again it looks 100% like a psp, but the back logo has PXP and not PSP. It has 32 gigs of memory so you can download roms and play it on the PXP. 11 megapixel camera, mp3, mp4, and mp5 player and so much more. This one cost me $89.99 and so far I havent had any problems with it.</p>
<p>There Ipad rip offs (apad), black berry (black bemy), and all kinds of stuff. If you guys want some really cool shit for hella cheap I suggest going here: <a href="http://www.chinagrabber.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.chinagrabber.com</a> .</p>
<p>Here is a pic of my hiphone (brand new still has plastic film on the screen):<br>

<p>And here is a pic of my PXP-2000 (psp go rip):<br>
<img src="http://i344.photobucket.com/albums/p348/tekidder_2008/mypxp-2000_2.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">I will be ordering more and posting them on this thread as I do!</span></span></span></p>
