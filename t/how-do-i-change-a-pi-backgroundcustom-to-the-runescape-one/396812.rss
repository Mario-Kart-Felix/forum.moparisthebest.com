    <title>How do i change a pi backgroundcustom to the runescape one?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-change-a-pi-backgroundcustom-to-the-runescape-one/396812</link>
    <description>im using a pi source and as we alll know pi sucks skill wise but the coding is fairly neat and not as scrambled and hard to figure out as delta .

my server pretty much loads all 474 models and is fairly clean with most skills fully working besides 3 but those are easily fixed i just aded them in quickly cause i wanted to get to the hard stuff first - silly me i dont know how to do this so i ask you guys...


i want my client to have the old runescape background with the flames the problem is the cache loads into c:/ and it is set to the name of background now i looked for this a little and only see people asking to remove it while i want to implent it my server is legit 1xs leveling and everything i have all the right animtions for  a 474 basicly everything works but i stumbled when i noticed another client that doesnt load the 474 has the old runescape bacground i tried copy and pasting there background method but i didnt have ne luck people talk about int 13 in client.java but for some reason the client i was using diddnt have int 13 (the one that has the background i want)
so long story short how do i make my background the runescape background? my background iss labeled backgroound</description>
