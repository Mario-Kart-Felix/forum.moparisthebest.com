    <title>Begginers Unity team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/begginers-unity-team/449401</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m currently working on a war ship game
It will be multiplayer indefinitely but I might add a campaign.
I am searching for intermediate - pro levels in unity, to be on my team you must have a basic understanding of how to use unity script or c#. It would also benefit the team if you have other skills. E.g. Modeller, gfx artist, GUI designer ect.
We are not looking for people who are professional, we are looking for people who want to learn. Of course we welcome professionals.

We currently need:
JavaScript/unityscript scripter
Moddelers
Gfx artists
GUI designers
Campaign designer (writing the story line)
XML programmer

We currently have a small team of three, I am an all rounder meaning that I do a bit of scripting, modelling, designing ect. I am not one of these owners that do nothing and expect developers to do anything. Other two are friends of mine one is a learning modeller, other is the sound FX creator.

Anybody is welcome as long as you have some sort of knowledge whether it be modelling, gfx designing, scripting ect.

If you would like to join our team please use the application form below, you must have an extent of knowledge that will benefit the team e.g. You are an artist or a programmer.

First name:
Date of birth:
Time zone:
How many hours will you be able to spend working?
Can you show us any pictures of your work?
Have you ever used unity3d before, if yes please specify what you were using for/achieved:
Preferred programming language:
Do you know any other programming languages?
What can you bring that will benefit the team?
Why do you want to join the team?


Thanks for reading, sorry if this was a bit long. If you have any questions feel free to post below.</description>
