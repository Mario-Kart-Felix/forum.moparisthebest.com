    <title>If you&#39;re anticipating tomorrow, read this (my hypotheses)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-youre-anticipating-tomorrow-read-this-my-hypotheses/419446</link>
    <description>I was talking to frell about this, and I figured I might as well organize it in a post. I mentioned a few of my ideas on here, but this is a more precise compilation.

[b]Botting prevention (you&#39;re all fucked)[/b] would be the first category to target. Jagex claims to be implementing some means of getting rid of all reflection bots, and others totaling up to 98% of all believed botters. We learned eventually this not only included injection bots, but also color bots. I&#39;d rather talk about reflection and injection bots first, however.

Reflection and injection bots rely on an executable system that runs through the Java Virtual Machine. This means the end result must be in bytecode, and it must use the standard edition of Java (in order to make use of the reflection API, and so on). There are speculations as to different ways Jagex could get rid of reflection and injection bots, one of the most complex being devising a system to significantly alter the client&#39;s state per-client distribution, making accessible fields extremely difficult to get. For those of you who are familiar with them, injection and reflection bots are dependent on updaters to locate and match patterns of bytecode operations in order to identify certain accessors (fields and methods) within the client. This complex means of obfuscation would make writing an exact and consistent updater very difficult.

Nevertheless, my hypothesis lies along a different plane, so to speak. I think they are moving the entire client state to native code, ergo, their client&#39;s state would no longer pass through the JVM. This means bytecode injection and reflection would be useless, because there would be no bytecode to analyze or to reflectively access. One major proponent to this theory was the news in which Jagex stated they are removing access to the unsigned client. The unsigned client does not allow custom native libraries to be loaded. This is significant because, had Jagex moved the majority of their client&#39;s code to native code, they would require all users to load the native library. This makes running in unsigned mode impossible. Moparisthebest brought up the idea of still being able to grab the display buffer or pushing events into the AWT event queue, as traditional bots do. As also replied, Jagex could easily write their own toolkit system as a workaround to using AWT, thereby breaking that as well. But, of course, bots could still grab the display buffer directly from opengl...

[b]Color bots[/b], such as Robotz in Disguise, seem confident they won&#39;t be affected. Jagex said they are targeted too, though. Jagex has always seemed to have systems for trying to detect macroers, ranging from random events to mouse pathway heuristics. I don&#39;t really think there are any possible ways of truly preventing color bots, but all bots as a whole have an underlying commonality: they aren&#39;t human. This is laughably obvious, but it&#39;s really important. With a heuristics model, Jagex can analyze the mouse actions of a bot user and compare them statistically to a model of a normal runescape player. Making the system learn from the billions of mouse events generated by runescape players, it could theoretically, and extremely precisely, differentiate between real players and automated players. This, in my opinion, would be one of the primary tools against all bots as a whole. Of course, they could always add systems for detecting if certain software was running in the background, etc, via native code. As mopar said, they can basically do anything via native code. I&#39;ll note that these more sophisticated means of detecting bots would easily cover more naive programs, like autotypers and autoclickers (@ judostar1, :P)

[b]Why wait until Tuesday? Sounds fishy...[/b] Frell asked me this question. He asked it from the point of view of why tuesday?, whereas I considered the more interesting question, why wait? Jagex seems to have been playing a very smart game. The most basic thing anyone can take out of all of these years of warring between the hacking community and Jagex is, bots can always prevail. I say can, not will, because of what is happening now. Jagex&#39;s code can never truly repel bots, but their userbase truly can. Jagex does not care about the recreational bot maker, the one that makes it for a challenge. They care about the ones designed for mass users and profits. Jagex has set up this entire process as a means of turning the community against bots. Here&#39;s how I am modeling out the situations:

1. Develop strategies and let the bots prevail  --&gt;  2. Move toward action by feeding the fanbase bullshit about &quot;wanting to tell them what they are up to, but not being able to,&quot; thereby making the community feel included and important  --&gt;  3. Announce significant action in order to rile up the community with anti-bot fever  --&gt;  4. Satisfy the community with delivering results, perhaps even mentioned as &quot;better than expected&quot;  --&gt;  5. Continue to feed the storm and fire by providing incentives and rewards to the community so long as they repel bots

Stage 1 would have been these last few months, 2 the last two weeks as we started unearthing messages from Jagex about fighting bots. We are in stage 3, moving into 4 tomorrow. Stage 5 comes after, and could last months. The whole point of this is to turn the community against bots. The community can do a more effective and permanent job of removing bots than Jagex can, which is why Jagex didn&#39;t do all this for &quot;instant-gratification,&quot; as Frell puts it!

A bit of evidence on all this: claims of people being banned after not botting for months seems to indicate Jagex has been watching for a long time. They are using a lot of pathos in their articles to drive at the emotions of their fans. They could have easily implemented all these changes overnight, then been like &quot;ta-da!,&quot; but they didn&#39;t. They are currently banning accounts very quickly, most likely so they have a nice staggering number of banned botting accounts to give everybody tomorrow, to help with stage 4. They have predesigned website templates for the timer, and the artwork that goes with it. These things don&#39;t happen overnight, either. And, of course, they already previewed some of the instant content to transition from stage 4 to 5, and I&#39;m sure they have a ton more planned. It takes Jagex months to plan, develop, test, and finalize content that goes into the game, even small stuff.

So, you&#39;re all being played. Fun. :)

[b]Economics and economies, we&#39;re going broke![/b] Yay! This is something I will touch briefly on, but we mustn&#39;t forget it! What will be the effects of suddenly removing millions of accounts of bots? Let&#39;s be naive for a bit:

Playing with these numbers...if 95% of pure essence comes from bots, and 70% of the users who craft the pure essence is also bots, this means what? There is a difference of 15% of legit users over botted users. This means a deficit in supply. (To rationalize my figures, I am conjecturing that botters have a tendency to bot gathering resources over crafting skills; another model would be needed from the opposite scenario). Basic economics: as demand remains constant and supply goes down, price goes up. I&#39;m sure most of you opportunists have realized this. If you believe this, you fell into the same trap I did. I ended up losing 180k between 2 nights buying/selling yew logs, because I failed to realize what was really going to happen.

The above theory works fine if demand remains constant. However, what is everyone doing right now? Buying. Buying like fucking mad. Buying is demand. The demand is going way up. Basic economics: as supply remains constant and demand increases, price increases. You can see that a lot of items are increasing in value right now. Well, let&#39;s just say this is not good at all for the RuneScape economy. Once botters are removed, the supply isn&#39;t going to crash. Why not? Because millions of players just spent 4 days stocking up like hell as a means to make a buck. They are going to dump all their items in the next week or two, which makes demand crash and supply go way up. This causes a massive surplus in the most important core commodity markets, meaning that price is going to go way down. The only good thing we can get out of this is that, because supply is going up and demand is going down, the equilibrium point between the two systems is going to go down (which means the economy is going to rebalance itself out at a much lower point than before, which everyone should want!)

This is really only the beginning of our troubles, however. I am making another conjecture: most botting accounts don&#39;t have a lot of cash on them. They do, however, have a lot of resources. Well, this really doesn&#39;t mean much. These resources were either never entered into the economy, or removed from the economy via a means of resources gathered by the bot. Basically, these resources have no impact on the economy if the account is removed. Botting accounts don&#39;t have a tangible effect on the economy if they are removed, they have the effect of having those fundamental services they provided removed. This removes the conveniences many RS players had to gather experience quickly if they had the money. But that&#39;s just it, money is the key. All these item values are going to be fucked up, but what happens to the amount of currency in the game? It remains constant, or perhaps even still increasing a bit from monsters.

Let&#39;s get into the money problem just a bit. Everyone here should know RuneScape is only increasing in total wealth. There are many more ways, quantitatively and popularly, of bringing gold into the game, than those removing it (such as construction, repairing armor, etc). Another fundamental economics principle: as the amount of currency increases, its value decreases. So even if prices are going down, the economy is still in inflation. I won&#39;t get into the theories and ideas behind whether a weaker or stronger currency is a good thing (especially since RS is just one macroeconomy, not a mixture of macroeconomies). Just bear in mind RuneScape is going to be superinflated when everything crashes, so nothing is going to be worth anything.

So yeah, lots of ideas and theories. Hopefully you found some part of this interesting. :P I look forward to replies on my theories, or better propositions. :)</description>
