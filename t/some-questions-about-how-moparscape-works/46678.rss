    <title>Some questions about how MoparScape works</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-questions-about-how-moparscape-works/46678</link>
    <description>Don&#39;t know if this is the right section (not too many to choose from) so Iam sorry if it&#39;s not. I am currently learning about java coding and have a few questions I need help with.

1) How does MoparScape get the images of items/objects/npcs and stuff? Is it coming from a place on the runescape site? Surely the files can&#39;t be included with a server source download.

2) Any good sugguestions for websites to learn about java coding? I have been looking around, gathing bit from bit from different tutorials, guides, and things like that. Also I have been looking at the source of different private servers comparing them and also trying to figure out how certain things work, and why.

*Looks at loooong road ahead* :$
