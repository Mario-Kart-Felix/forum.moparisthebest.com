I have played so many RSPS’ recently and cannot find anything decent. Hence why I have started this little project. I am building a team of great people with a lot of patience and passion for the game of Runescape. It will be a spawn server because economy servers are made redundant due to the popularity of OSRS.</p>
<p>I want to create an environment where the most elite pkers will be respected; not those whom has the biggest banks. The server will still have a reward system that feels like you are progressing, with that being said I do not want the main purpose of people playing to earn wealth. Much of the success of this server will be due to the very active staff team, hosting events and tournaments to keep the users engaged. The server will be built upon and around the community of players.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">My role:</span><br>
I will be the community manager for the team and financing the release of the server. I have no experience in coding and I do not wish to learn.</p>
<p>*What I want for the release:<br>
Perfected and flawless combat system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Timing</li>
<li>Projectiles</li>
<li>Prayer</li>
<li>Magic (with freeze, tb and venge timers)<br>
Clean and stable server base. Nothing fancy.<br>
There is no necessity to be up to date with the OSRS content we will implement them when the community feels the time is right. So the community can be apart of the growth of the server.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Developers:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Needing two developers with decent experience in PI|317 clients, servers and mySQL DB<br>
Client and server based developer: Available<br>
Website developer: Available | Minibeast</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Staff team:</span></span><br>
YouTuber: Available</p>
<ul>
<li>Are an outgoing and social person? Have you ever wanted to start a YouTube channel? Here is your chance; have the ability to upload exciting content for your viewers such as PK events, new BETA testing teasers and dazzle them with your PKing tekkers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Player Moderator: Available | Available<br>
Are you on a RSPS for the most part of your day? Do you consider yourself a role model player? This is the perfect position for you. With this rank comes greater responsibility; you will be required to host daily PvP tournaments and events according to the needs of the players. You will be a moderator with no executive command abilities apart from ::mute and ::jail.</p>
<p>Server Moderator: Available | Available<br>
This is a standard and generic position nothing really to explain. You will be a moderator with executive command abilities.</p>
<p>If you’re interested please hit me up in pm or reply below. None of these positions are paid until server release.</p>
