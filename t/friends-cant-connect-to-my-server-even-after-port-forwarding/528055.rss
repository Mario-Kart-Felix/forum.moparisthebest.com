    <title>Friends can&#39;t connect to my server even after port forwarding?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/friends-cant-connect-to-my-server-even-after-port-forwarding/528055</link>
    <description>Ok...don&#39;t judge me but I have port forwarded after following about 10 tuts and i think got it correct, because I went to canyouseeme.org. It said that my ports were opened and i even did my firewall but when my friends go to my webclient they load everything successfully but get &quot;error connecting to server&quot;. I don&#39;t know what the problem can be I opened my UDP and TCP ports was I only supposed to do one? Help is greatly appreciated, thank you.


Here is my client.java:

I&#39;ve tried changing them both to my no-ip but that doesn&#39;t even work, I can connect regardless even if it is not at localhost or 127.0.0.1. Does anyone have any type of tips or reasons to why this may be happening? If you need more pictures I will post it.

Ps: using a 317 PI
