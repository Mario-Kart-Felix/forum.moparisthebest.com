    <description>Okay I want to get serious in gaming like making a game from scratch like they did with &quot;Runescape&quot;. But I cannot find any decent tutorials on how to make my own 3D MMORPG from scratch. Although I have read a few articles saying to start of by making &quot;Runescape&quot; Private Servers&quot; as it is a good base on learning small amounts of &quot;Java Coding&quot; but others say that it is a disgrace to start making a &quot;Runescape&quot; Private Server&quot; as it is a copy of &quot;Runescape&quot; with hardly any educated Java codes and people thinking that they are great at Java when really they are fucking about with codes and giving themselves a self feel of accomplishment. Is this true?, should I start of by making a &quot;Runescape Private Server&quot; or continue on my search to finding how to make a &quot;Real Game&quot; from scratch?</description>

              <p>Like he said you need to study Java…<br>
And it would take a pretty long time to make a decent game alone using Java.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, you have to read books on java. I know I hate them to. But, I don’t see any harm in starting off of RSPS’s. You’re not going to pull a 3d game out of your ass. You have to study java. You’re also not going to find tutorials on it because it takes a long time to make a game.</p>
<p>Overall, read a book on java, start off with RSPS, gradually make your knowledge on java stronger, and then try to create the game.<br>
Good luck. Btw, I think this goes in general programming.</p>
