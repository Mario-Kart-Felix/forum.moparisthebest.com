    <title>I&#39;m just wondering</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-just-wondering/228004</link>
    <description>Okay so I&#39;m a freshman in high school and we was goin over stuff in algebra and I noticed that there are some statements in algebra that are the same in c++ and java... such as

if - then statements
variables
integers
doubles

and one that I had seen in programming before but never really understood what it meant and so I was wondering if &quot;Null&quot; meant the same in algebra as it does in programming, because in algebra a null set is when the answer does not match with one of the &quot;pre-set&quot; variables like

{2,3,4,5}

x = 4

2x - 2

the answer would then be NULL (or something close to that equation)

so in programming is a &quot;null&quot; an answer that doesnt match up with the &quot;pre-set&quot; variables?
I just kinda wanted to know because I didn&#39;t really understand &quot;NULL&quot;


also how would you make the &quot;NULL SET&quot; symbol on a keyboard, and if you can make it, can you then use that in a program?</description>
