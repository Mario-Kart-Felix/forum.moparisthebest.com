    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-codes-needed/147665</link>
    <description>So was wondering .. Does anyone have the 100% guthan, no bug, healing code ? I mean i haven&#39;t seen it around for a very long time, and no one has ever posted it for ages :s

And that goes for DDS attack (no spec bar, but double hit) as well.

Anyone have those?</description>
