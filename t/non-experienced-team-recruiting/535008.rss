    <title>Non experienced team -&gt; Recruiting!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/non-experienced-team-recruiting/535008</link>
    <description>[center][size=14pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size]
This thread is looking for &quot;non-experienced programmers&quot;. This project is mainly to get a group of programmers to experienced level.
 And since im not experienced and the road there might be tough alone, I decided to make this a project for multiple people to learn and create.

I&#39;m at the time 14 years old. (15 in January) I&#39;m from Sweden and my dream job Is probably some kind of game developer. 
So starting early to learn a little about coding will probably help me a bit. That is mainly why I want to start this project, also getting to know other people and work with them.

[size=14pt][u]About the server[/u][/size]
The revision we&#39;ll be working on will either be a 614-666 or a 718.
We&#39;ll have to decide what revision/server we want if a team actually is created. The server will mostly be for PvM and skilling, with a bit of Pking. Ofcourse we&#39;ll discuss this matter if team is created.

[size=14pt][u]Applications[/u][/size]
Please fill in this application if intrested in joining the team. Remember this is for non-experienced.
[code]For how long have you been coding? - 
How much time do you have for this project? - 
Do you have any RS/RSPS knowledge? - 
What is your age? - 
What is your time zone? -
