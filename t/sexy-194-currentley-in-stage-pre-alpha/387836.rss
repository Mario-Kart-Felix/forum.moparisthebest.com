    <title>Sexy-194 (Currentley in stage : Pre-alpha)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sexy-194-currentley-in-stage-pre-alpha/387836</link>
    <description>Some of you may have seen our old development thread Sexy-289, well sadly the development of sexy-289 has come to a stop due to a major loss in content because Daniels computer had to be wiped and he could not save the files. So after that we decided to make another development although this time based on the first revision of RS2 let me give you some background knowledge

[b]Background Knowledge[/b]
Revision 194 was the first version of RS2 
It was also known as the BETA Stage 
During the BETA Stages of Rs  the maps were totally different


Some of you may have noticed the tag Pre-alpha in our title for those of you who do not understand this we are going to be going through 4 stages while developing Sexy-189 They are the following

[b]Pre-alpha[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pre-alpha refers to all activities performed during the software project prior to testing. These activities can include requirements analysis, software design, software development and unit testing.

In typical open source development, there are several types of pre-alpha versions. Milestone versions include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the functionality is complete.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]Alpha[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin software testing (alpha is the first letter of the ancient Greek alphabet, used as the number 1). In this phase, developers generally test the software using white box techniques. Additional validation is then performed using black box or gray box techniques, by another testing team. Moving to black box testing inside the organization is known as alpha release.[1]

Alpha software can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss. The exception to this is when the alpha is available publicly (such as a pre-order bonus), in which developers normally push for stability so that their testers can test properly. External availability of alpha software is uncommon.

The alpha phase usually ends with a feature freeze, indicating that no more features will be added to the software. At this time, the software is said to be feature complete.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]Beta[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Beta is the software development phase following alpha (beta is the second letter of the ancient Greek alphabet, used as the number 2. It is not nowadays usual to speak of a later gamma test). It generally begins when the software is feature complete. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating usability testing. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called beta release and this is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization that developed it.

The users of a beta version are called beta testers. They are usually customers or prospective customers of the organization that develops the software, willing to test the software without charge, often receiving the final software free of charge or for a reduced price.

Beta version software is often useful for demonstrations and previews within an organisation and to prospective customers. Some developers refer to this stage as a preview, prototype, technical preview (TP), or early access.

Some software is kept in perpetual beta.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]End of life[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;When software is no longer sold or supported, the product is said to have reached end-of-life&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now that ive covered that ill move along to the important stuff Server goals

[b]Goals[/b]
As the server we are using is basically just a framework were going to need to a dd some really important stuff like

[b]NPCS[/b] - [i]Currently there Are no NPC&#39;s/Npchandling[/i]
[b]Minigames[/b] - [i]Im unaware of what minigames were in the 194 era if anybody could tell me it would be much appreciated [/i]

More to come

Now for some pictures of what there is so far

<p>I do consider my self an intermediate programmer which means it takes me time to do things that i think are harder for example creating an npc rendering system now some of you out there may be like “Oh well that’s easy i could make one i two seconds flat” but me achieving that goal would be a huge accomplishment for me.</p>
<p>An update for noobs are ftw ive continued to look for a 194 deob and ive come across one released by MITB now who knows how long it might take for someone to get that working as it was released in 06 if by chance i do get it working ill be sure to update you again</p>

Although it’s the same principals I bet all the packets are different to a 317, aren’t they? Do you have any documentation/links on 194s? It’d be appreciated to share some for a version 2 and an expansion on the 194 section for my next project tools download.<br>

There is very few to no documentation as the 194 revision was the first version of RS2 and was limited to only about 100 player although speaking about your project tools i think i still have the 289 cache and client on my desktop if you would like you could have them for a 289 section it can connect fine with the shard base.[/quote]</p>

I love the 194. It’s when I joined RuneScape. Always remember the platebodies model. Hope you succeed.</p>
