    <title>How to get ur server online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-ur-server-online/151923</link>
    <description>k well ive seen people posting about how to get your server online...
so i thought id make a post

2 chapters:


chapter 1:learning how to get a source and running it

k well first go to the rs2 server downloads and look for a good source (good base) once you got it open up your client.java from the download and change what the source is called to yours so: the one i download its called jordiescape... so i open up client.java and ctrl + F and in the first field i put jordiescape and in the other 1 cmanscape.
now if ur server is like dodian were its uber and dodian, just do that 2 times. once you got that all done, scroll down the files and double click runserver.bat or compile.bat or w/e and presto! and im just hoping u have no-ip cause im too lazy to right it :S

chapter 2:mopar serverstatus

to do this go to www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php and scroll all the way down and there should be a &quot;post ur server&quot; or w/e, 
so runserver/post/log on and play!
