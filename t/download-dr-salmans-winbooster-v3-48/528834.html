        <p>Mazgar felt the familiar itch of danger at her back growing more and more pronounced, and glanced often over her shoulder, though Coals and Merthun were on the rearguard and both were more than competent.But it wasn’t Coals and Merthun who sent up the alarm — it came from the north, their left flank, from Na-Nasha and Glavius.The two men arrived a few moments behind their signal.He turned to the refugees.Leave everything, you hear?<br>

Cheydinhal is just down this hill, not even half a mile.Carry Riff Belancour, there — he’s got a funny foot.The horses were cut loose and the most elderly put up on them in tandem.Mothers clutched their infants.Falcus set the pace, a slow trot, and the boy on Mazgar’s shoulders giggled, obviously thinking it was all a game of some kind.<br>
True to her boast, Goblin kept up, running alongside her.Falcus picked up the tempo a little as they burst into a field; the walls of Cheydinhal were visible through the next line of trees.But the wormies were coming fast, toward their left flank, ranged in a rough phalanx, and Mazgar could easily make the calculation that they weren’t going to make it.A few of the townsfolk screamed or began to cry, but most broke into full-on, terrified flight.Falcus began shouting orders, but Mazgar couldn’t make them out.<br>

A moment later, though, Na-Nasha, Coals, Casion, and Sugar-Lick broke off and formed a semicircle with Kuur behind them.She looked back once before they reached the trees, because she felt the heat on her back and heard the dull thud of an explosion.She couldn’t see anything but black, greasy smoke and billowing flame.They came through the trees into the clearing around the walls.The gate was off to the right.</p>
