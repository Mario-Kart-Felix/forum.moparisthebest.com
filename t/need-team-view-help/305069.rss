    <title>Need team view help :)</title>

    <description>Hey there, Me and my friend are a little new to private server&#39;s and were hoping for some help.

We have spent portions of today trying to figure it out, but nothing has seemed to work. 
We&#39;ve been over port forwarding, trying different i.p&#39;s, and are finally stumped. So came to the forums hoping for a little help.

I&#39;m sure this is a common problem, or an easy fix, we just need it pointing out to us.

We have a 508 Tokkulscape base, and the mezzyscape 508 client as suggested on the tokkulscape thread, and have successfully set it up to load and work on the host&#39;s computer.
However, we then went and port forwarded, and upon arriving home, I can not connect to the game itself. 
It just seems to stop at &quot;connecting to update server&quot;

Is anyone able to point out what we have done/are doing wrong, and put us on the track to a fix?
This would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks all.</description>
