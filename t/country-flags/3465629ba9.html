<p>“Oh look at me guys, I can do something different and disagree with xEnt so I’m like a uber leet programmer, even though anyone with an IQ of 10 or more would think the way I’m suggesting is awful, I’ll still defend my point because otherwise I’ll look like a bigger idiot than I already do!”[/quote]</p>
<p>Exactly, you were the first to respond to a troll post, and you’re proud of that?<br>
You still haven’t gotten past the flag deal, even after I clarified it wasn’t about the flag. Remember when I said you remind me of Snoopy? Huge example right here.</p>
<p>I want to take you back to our last topic, where I said you felt insecure because people were laughing at you from that joke you pulled. Now I’m going to point something out to further prove my point, that you’re still insecure.<br>
I mention your name in the list of idiots who replied, and you retaliate with sarcasm. Not only did that sarcasm made you look completely stupid, it also shows a sign of insecurity (Oh my god not this again… I wish he would shut up about this…) Yes, insecurity. You get offended awfully easy; Work on that and maybe people will stop attacking those obvious signs.</p>
<p>I’m going to toughen you up (funny saying that over the internet, but if you need help, what can you do?).</p>

<p>I want you to look back, and tell me how long it took you to explain why my method was such a bad idea. It actually WAS your way or no way, until I had to ask you.<br>
Of course I have to act as if I’m serious, what do you expect from me? If I made it obvious I was trolling, would you still have answered? No. You can think whatever you’d like, none of which matters.</p>
<p>Wait, was it you who said development was dead, and you contributed to it? No… Wait yeah that was you, wasn’t it?<br>
I do see you as a popular person, and I did pick you out of a group to prove a point. You’re correct, however, saying that I’m doing this for respect and/or reputation? You seriously don’t believe that, I know for a fact that you don’t. We both know why this happened, come on xEnt, I know you’re not “Kryptix dumb”.</p>
<p>Oh, but it was about development. I use to dev on a few servers myself. I still from time-to-time talk to my old buddies about things I should have improved in our old source, like ways to kill off bots, unnecessary redundant code, so on and so on. Anyways, that’s neither here nor there. Fact of it is, that is exactly why I did it, and it’s exactly why I toll on Moparscape.</p>

i stopped wasting my breath on this post, i won’t bother to write a novel about how stupid Dehumanized is. You can continue thinking that adding client-side checks to validate a flag and patching the client to handle an incoming invalid flag, is better than the server performing 1 if statement check server-side.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Going to quote this to further prove 3 of my points. Your way or no way, discontinuation of development because of point 1, and that you’re just an idiot.</p>
<p>I’m only explaining myself of why I started this argument, so I could get to the real factor here without idiots like Snoopy, Kryptix and Ecko joining in, clueless to what’s going on. Typical that they did anyways, I’m still going to prove my point and show you why.</p>
<p>This wasn’t about some flags, it was about showing everyone who you are, xEnt. Just get the flags out of your head, I had to get your attention. Let that go, it had a bigger purpose behind it. Yeah, server-side validation IS the way to go, I know this, we all know this, it was pretty stupid of you to think I didn’t know this. Let it go.</p>
<p>Like I said before, about development, we cannot get anywhere with it because of people like you. It’s always “my way and screw any other way”. Hell, you could not even explain why it was a bad idea. Instead, you decided to insult and run away. If this is what you consider development, then I shudder to think how you are going to make it in the computer science world my friend.</p>
<p>Knowingly people are going to ignore this post and continue to be stuck on the flag deal, I just want you to understand, you need to work on your people skills.[/quote]</p>
<p>I just said my opinion because what you said was not currect thats what a community forum is for.<br>
But as we know your a fucking retard end of story.</p>
<p>I seem too bee famous since everyone like talking about me, I can tell you this much, its the community tha creates the “flamers”. I seen planty of guys who are good and then they come here and get angry. what does that tell you?</p>
<p>I honestly don’t care who talks trash about me, I have a life beside this so I can choose what I want to do, im sure many guys here doesn’t have that option .</p>

<p>…Yes you did, and you’re doing it right now. What does it matter how long you’re online for? It’s irrelevant.</p>
<p>It’s amazing. You see something you want to respond to, but you pick the most ridiculous response. Can I ask you something? When you re-read what you say, does it actually make sense to you?</p>
<p>Honestly Snoopy, I would very much appreciate it if we just stopped talking. I can feel my IQ lowering every time I see and read your replies.</p>

<a class="mention" href="../../u/dehumanized-2.html">@Dehumanized</a>, instead of all this bullshit chatting, why not go duplicate the feature, implementing it ‘your’ way and prove what you are saying is true. Upon completing it, release your code and let people judge for themselves the differences between the two.<br>

        <p>Props to this guy for pointing out some obvious insecurities in this community. Lets review the troll<span class="bbcode-b">ed</span> topic shall we?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yong min: Originally posts a ripped version of xEnt’s code off the BeyonceRSC source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>95% of viewers/idiots see the code and obviously see the length of it and say COOL HOW DO I PLUGIN LOL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dehumanized <span class="bbcode-i">critiques</span> the obvious flaw and redundancy of it’s length, and suggest an alternate solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>xEnt gets offended for being questioned on the efficiency of the code due to the lack of critiquing that occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although xEnt’s approach was right, still feels the need to defend it even though Dehumanized never said <span class="bbcode-b">it wasn’t the right approach</span> and falls for the bait.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The usual lackies of xEnt come to rescue of the assumed god of the RSC section and try to flame Dehumanized even though his intention to troll was quite obvious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 pages later it still seems no one has figured it out, plus the use of Mopar’s 201020102 moderators seem to prove that they are and will remain useless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually someone will cry, a mod will close it, someone will get banned, and we’ll find the same situation occur in a couple days time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

        <p>not bad. needs a bit of work though.</p>
<p>3: redundancy and length? didn’t read any about that</p>
