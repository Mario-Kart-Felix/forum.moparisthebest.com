<p>Mmmkai, well more guns being legal, means that people who want to use a gun for a criminal purpose can get them pretty easy. It wouldn’t be hard to break in to someone elses house while they are out and take their gun. Surely, having more guns would mean more shooting, which means more deaths and injuries through gun related crime.</p>

<p>You are correct in a general sort of way - more guns in existence increases the chance that a gun will be fired somewhere for some purpose. But if it’s so easy to get a gun, why would you bother breaking into someone’s house for it? What if his son is at home and knows how to shoot because dad’s been showing him, in the interest of safety, how to handle this potentially dangerous thing in their house? What if the guy took his gun with him, and when he comes back in five minutes and finds you there, he’ll shoot you? Or what if he just decides to hit you in the leg and wait for the cops to show up? The risks associated with crime are much greater when your intended victims might fight back.</p>
<p>The problem with your argument is that it really doesn’t address this other perspective. Yes, more permissive gun laws would allow more people to carry guns. Some of them might even be criminals. But the vast majority of people just want to live their lives. For those who aren’t content to let others be, suddenly looking down the barrel of a Glock 20 should do a lot to change their minds.</p>
<p>Under ideally implemented laws, there would never be a person who just runs out for a bit and leaves the gun at home. You’d have it, constantly. And in such a place, even if you chose not to carry a gun, you would receive the benefits of being assumed armed simply because everyone else is.</p>
<p>Simply put: when you might have to back up your offensive actions with your life, it makes you <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> eager to get along with people.</p>
<p>side note: It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_IRA_arms_importation" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">very possible</a> for criminals and various other violently-inclined folks to get weapons, in spite of laws to the contrary.</p>

Actually gun control makes crime go up.  As I said in another thread think about this:  In america, if you want to rob a bank you have to consider the strong possibility that multiple people in that bank just might have guns on them.  In england, you don’t have to worry about that at all.  So you would be much more likely to rob the bank in england than in america, where you have to think about possible consequences.<br>

<p>You are entitled to your opinion, even if it is wrong.  Here is an article I found about the concealed carry law that was put into effect recently where I live in ohio:</p>

<p>Mmmkai, well more guns being legal, means that people who want to use a gun for a criminal purpose can get them pretty easy. It wouldn’t be hard to break in to someone elses house while they are out and take their gun. Surely, having more guns would mean more shooting, which means more deaths and injuries through gun related crime.</p>
<p>Youth in England seems to think that the only think to do with a gun, is too shoot black teenagers for no reason.</p>

<p>So they are finally getting some sense in their head and realizing that outlawing guns is doing nothing but increasing crime?  Good for them, the next step is to allow law-abiding citizens to carry guns as well.</p>
