    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/working-with-somebody-forum-maker/497880</link>
    <description>Hey guys, basically if you have a server, but need a forums I am willing to work with you and make a forum for the server. I can also, if you don&#39;t want to work with me for some reason I&#39;m willing to charge $5 to make a forums with pips added, crowns, topics(you want me to add) and other things you want me to do. But I prefer to be with somebody that has there own server up but just needs a forums. If you want me to make a forums or work with you and make a forums for the server pm me or post below.

I have no clue where to put this but I am going to post this under this topic because I see some people adv there server that don&#39;t have a forums, If so put this in the correct section. LIKE I SAID I KNOW THIS IS IN THE WRONG SECTION, BUT I COULDN&#39;T FIND THE CORRECT SECTION TO POST THIS.
Thank you.</description>
