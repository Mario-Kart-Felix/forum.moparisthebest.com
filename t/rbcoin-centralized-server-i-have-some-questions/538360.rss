... we decided to change the cash out method because pwned made a very good point. in the state of West Virginia i require a few licenses so if you would like to get in on the coins contact me on skype. The cash out method would be 0.001  that&#39;s 1$ per 1000. We suggest that you do not cash out in june once the sites done you can play games. Recieve credits.

At the moment we are offering free mining on our High CPU Amazon Aws Server. its not 24/7 but i run it everyday for 3-6 hours. 

Pwned if you wish for a free mining contact me on skype thanks.</description>
