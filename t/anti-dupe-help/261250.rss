    <title>Anti-dupe help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anti-dupe-help/261250</link>
    <description>Alright. below is a form of anti-dupe I added to my server, keep in mind this code is based off of the Richscape source so it may look different but it works. What I need to know is how do I add to this process to make it search for more than one item? I have it set to noted red partyhats right now, but I want it to look for more than just red partyhats, I want it to search for all noted partyhats.

[CODE]public void process() {
		if (hasAmount(1039, 2) == true)  {
		removeAllItems();
		Send(&quot;Your duplicated items have just been jacked by Matt....GF.&quot;);
		}[/CODE]

This is the process I have right now, how would I correctly add onto it so that it would search for more than just that partyhat? Help is greatly appreciated.</description>

              <p>You can easily make a static integer something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static int dupechecker[] = {ITEMID, ITEMID, ITEMID}; </code></pre>
<p>and then make it check via the method you are using.</p>
