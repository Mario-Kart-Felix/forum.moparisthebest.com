    <description>I need a better method for calling your familiar.
I had one working but it only works when your close to my summoned npc.
Once i go farther than where the npc is at it doesnt let my summon it.
I changed the part for it but it does work but it summons more than 1 npc.
I need help making it better for when you call your npc.</description>
