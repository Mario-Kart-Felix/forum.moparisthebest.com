    <description>I was wondering if anyone knows any free antivirus programs or virus scanners that you don&#39;t need to register to use. There&#39;s this thing on my toolbar (next to the times) that is a red circe with an X in the middle...here&#39;s a pic:

<p>The proccess of deleting what you have is VERY DIFFICULT. I've been through it twice. No anti spyware will get rid of it, it creates hidden backups and re-downloads itself. There are many varients, you either have spy sherrif, spyaxe, smitfraud, cws, or something else.</p>

<p>Go in general section to the sticky on virus scanners. You will find ewido anti mal-ware and that is good for what you have but do int in safe mode. And If you now where it is hidden thenuse the program also in my thread called moveonboot.</p>
