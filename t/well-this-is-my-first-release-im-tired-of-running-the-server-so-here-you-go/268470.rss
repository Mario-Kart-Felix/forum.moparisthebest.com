    <description>I dont have the time to keep runnning my server.I had a couple people start running it for me but it just isnt working out..So i am going to release the server and client..I put tons of work into this and it took along time.I didnt add d claws seeing that they are over kill..But you can do what you want idc.the server is still online and will be offline within 2 weeks.The client still has the ip in it so you have to change it or it will connect to the server that is online sry if its advertizeing but it wont last long im turning it off just waiting for vps to run out.Im not posting pics due to the simple fact that im quiting i really dont care if any one uses it.the server is bloodspec.Do what u will.As i siad i put alot of work in it and ill check back to see what people think.good luck with it.If you do use it have alittle respect and post a relply.
