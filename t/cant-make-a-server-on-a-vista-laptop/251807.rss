<p>Why can’t you just tell us what’s wrong WITHOUT making us contact you?</p>
<p>If you know how we can help you, doesn’t that mean you can sort it out yourself? Or did you mean something else?</p>
<p>Be more clear please? :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Im on a laptop behind a router.  I have hosted before, but on a computer with no firewalls and no router.  I have no idea whats wrong and ive tried everything, I want you to contact me via MSN so I can go through that one feature where you can view my computer and controll everything yourself to help me get this sorted out. I think its called remote control?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 21, 2008, 01:42:10 pm[/size][hr]So can anyone help?</p>
