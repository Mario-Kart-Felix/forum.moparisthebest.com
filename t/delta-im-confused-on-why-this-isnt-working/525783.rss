    <title>[Delta]I&#39;m confused on why this isn&#39;t working?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-im-confused-on-why-this-isnt-working/525783</link>
    <description>Now I started to add to delta&#39;s crafting(), but it doesn&#39;t seem to work.  I would like the code work by cutting the gem then after it cuts the gem it loops back and if there is any other of the same uncut gem it would go through the code again, but I&#39;m not sure if I added it right..I was using the runecrafting() method as a guide, but it doesn&#39;t seem it would like to work.
  Heres the code

[code]public void crafting(int skillAdd, int itemDelete, int itemAdd, int skillNeeded) {
int gem = amountOfItem(itemDelete);
if(playerLevel[12] &lt; skillNeeded) {
sM(&quot;You need at least &quot;+skillNeeded+&quot; crafting to craft this.&quot;);
return;
} else
	    if(playerHasItem(itemDelete) &amp;&amp; gem &gt; 0);
	    deleteItem(itemDelete, getItemSlot(itemDelete), 1);
	    addItem(itemAdd, 1);
            addSkillXP(skillAdd,12);
	    sM(&quot;You cut the uncut &quot;+getItemName(itemAdd)+&quot;.&quot;);
	    setAnimation(885);
}[/code]
I tried to put a &quot;return&quot; after the animation, but it would involve another clicking motion, like use the chisel on the uncut gem again.

Thanks for your guys help</description>
