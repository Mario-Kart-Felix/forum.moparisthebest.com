    <title>JFrame.glasspane - could be useful</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jframe-glasspane-could-be-useful/139733</link>
    <description>so i was looking around on [url=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/rootpane.html]This page[/url] when i found that JFrame, JDialog and JApplet have something called a glasspane, it covers the whole JFrame and can block events

anyway, i thought it could be useful for cherokee
it turns out, it only works for JComponent subclasses

a way to make it work is to use bcel to change the clients main Canvas into JComponent, then add that canvas to the JFrame content pane, (you cant add the applet, only the canvas)

the idea works, iv written a little loader to show you all

the problem is implementing it with cherokee, it only accepts an applet, not a Component, we would have to rewrite quite a lot of it
any ideas with that?

im thinking we could replace getAppletInstance() to getComponentInstance(), or maybe get the JFrame instance and replace it in RS2Setup

also, it blocks key events, and i havent figured out how to allow them
also, i havent checked if the glasspane stops the fake events in com.cherokee.event
also, moparisthebest first told me about [url=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/rootpane.html]this page[/url]</description>

              <p>I have long been considering a GlassPane ever since I saw the idea, and it is a good one if it could be implemented correctly.  We would want to be able to draw a mouse point on it, and block true human events while allowing com.cherokee.event generated events to go through.  I wonder how hard it would be to write our own GlassPane that could go over an applet, what do you think?</p>
