    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-a-noob-just-started-yesterday-can-i-gat-some-help-please/65587</link>
    <description>Ya.. i just started playing moparscape yesterday and i find it very cool, although i have had a few problems and i&#39;m looking for some help. 

1. Everytime i try to logg on to a server i have seen on the list, other than 127.0.0.1, it says error server not connecting click cancel and clik start server to make your own. Then i do what it says and It still gives me the same line over and over on every server i have tried. I just wanted to know, do i need a specific user or pass for these if not how the hell do i get in them.

2. When i get on 127.0.0.1 i have a lot of fun until i have to get of or i lose connection. Then i lose all of the progress i have done. How do i save my acc on this server/any server?

I would appreciate any help i can get. I am not very smart so i can&#39;t make my own server...those tutorials drive me crazy. Please reply i need help badly</description>

              <p>It’s nice to see new players every day <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> The error connecting to server means that the server you try to go on is offline or the port is wrong. To change the port you click “File” in Moparscape client and then “New port”. The port is 43594 on most servers, but it might be 5555 on PK servers. Second part, when you log in using 127.0.0.1 it goes to the Hybridscape server already put in the client and it has no possibility tosave any character files because it hasn’t any files expect in the client which you can’t edit. If you want to get on servers go to <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php</a> there is those servers which are currently online and the port of the servers is there also so if you want to get on a server which has port 5555 you just change the port like I told you above. Characters are basically saved on every server you go, but I prefer making your own server since I don’t know many 24/7 servers, so if you make your own server you can get on it anytime you want. Ask me if you need help. Hope this helps. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
