    <title>Compiler Worked?</title>

    <description>Does this mean it worked?

Javac: file not found: *.java
Usage: javac &lt;options&gt; &lt;source files&gt;
use - help for a list of possible options
Finished!
Press any key to continue

It looks like it did because it said Finished.
But It looks like It didnt because It said File not found.
I have no idea, somebody tell me how to fix this.</description>
