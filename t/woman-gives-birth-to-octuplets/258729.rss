    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;BELLFLOWER, Calif. (Jan. 26) - A woman gave birth to eight babies in Southern California on Monday, the world&#39;s second live-born set of octuplets.
The mother, who was not identified, gave birth to six boys and two girls weighing between 1 pound, 8 ounces and 3 pounds, 4 ounces, doctors at Kaiser Permanante Medical Center told The Associated Press.
The hospital had scheduled a Caesarean section for seven babies, but doctors were surprised by the eighth.
&quot;My eyes got to be the size of saucers,&quot; Dr. Karen Maples told The Los Angeles Times, explaining her reaction to the last birth. &quot;We just went on and delivered the babies.&quot;
She said the babies were in stable condition and would probably remain in the hospital for at least two months. She said the mother should be released in a week.
Kaiser spokeswoman Myra Suarez said she could not release any information about the mother, including her condition or whether she used fertility drugs. Such drugs make multiple births more likely.
&quot;They are all doing the best they can,&quot; Suarez told the AP.
The first baby was born at 10:43 a.m.; the eighth one at 10:48 a.m.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>Latest on this thread:</p>
<blockquote>BELLFLOWER, Calif. (Jan. 27) - Just think: eight cribs, eight highchairs, eight strollers (or maybe four double-strollers), and far too many dirty diapers to count.
A woman in Southern California gave birth Monday to the second set of octuplets ever delivered alive in the United States.
<p>Doctors described the six boys and two girls as a feisty bunch who made their entrance kicking and crying and seemed to be doing remarkably well, despite arriving nine weeks premature. They ranged in weight from 1 pound, 8 ounces, to 3 pounds, 4 ounces.<br>
“We were fortunate that this patient was extremely strong, very courageous and able to handle these births,” said Dr. Karen E. Maples, who is chief of service for obstetrics and gynecology at Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center and delivered Baby No. 8.<br>
No pictures of the children were released, and at the mother’s request doctors declined to reveal her name, any information about her family or whether she took fertility drugs before becoming pregnant, though outside experts said it is almost certain she did.<br>
The chances of delivering eight babies naturally are “unbelievably rare,” said Dr. Richard Paulson, director of the fertility program at the University of Southern California.<br>
The babies have not been named yet, and the staff assigned them letters A through H in the meantime. They were expected to remain hospitalized for several weeks and could face serious developmental problems later on because of their small size.<br>
“They are doing amazingly well at this time,” said Dr. Mandhir Gupta, a neonatologist who was part of the team of 46 doctors, nurses and others who took part in the cesarean section delivery. But he added: “I won’t be able to comment on chances of survival because we’ve never had eight babies born at 30 weeks before.”<br>
The odds of survival drop off dramatically in multiple births, particularly if there are more than three babies. The risks include breathing and eating difficulties and growth problems because their lungs and other systems are often underdeveloped. They also may have hearing or vision problems and learning disabilities as they mature.<br>
In fact, the risks in multiple births are so high that when a woman is pregnant with more than three babies, doctors routinely recommend “selective reduction,” or aborting some of them. But Dr. Harold M. Henry, director of maternal-fetal medicine for the hospital, would not discuss what took place in this case.<br>
The babies were still in incubators and their mother had not been able to hold them yet. Three had oxygen tubes up their noses to help them breathe. The first four were expected to begin taking milk sometime Tuesday, with the others shortly after that.<br>
“That’s the biggest test,” Gupta said. “We want to make sure that they start tolerating and digesting the milk.”<br>
The woman and her doctors were actually expecting seven children, not eight. The delivery team was thinking the hard work was over after that seventh baby was removed from the womb, when another physician spotted another little hand, Maples said.<br>
The mother reacted calmly to the news, said Dr. Jalil Riazi, an anesthesiologist. “Her question was, ‘Really, an eighth baby? How did we miss that baby?’” he said.<br>
The mother had checked into the hospital in her 23rd week and spent nearly two months working with doctors in preparation for the big day. Mainly she got a lot of bed rest, Maples said, while the medical team repeatedly conducted practice sessions.<br>
The world’s first live octuplets were born in 1967 in Mexico City, but all died within 14 hours, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.<br>
The United States’ first live octuplets were born in Houston in 1998, three months premature. The tiniest died a week after the birth. The surviving siblings turned 10 in December and were reported to be doing well by their mother.<br>
“It’s wonderful watching them be together. They are happy to have each other. They’re doing their homework right now,” Nkem Chukwu said Monday.</p>

<p>I hope they all turn out okay, because that would be pretty cool. A kid from an octuplet family…that’s a story to tell your friends  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <blockquote>BELLFLOWER, Calif. (Jan. 26) - A woman gave birth to eight babies in Southern California on Monday, the world's second live-born set of octuplets.
The mother, who was not identified, gave birth to six boys and two girls weighing between 1 pound, 8 ounces and 3 pounds, 4 ounces, doctors at Kaiser Permanante Medical Center told The Associated Press.
The hospital had scheduled a Caesarean section for seven babies, but doctors were surprised by the eighth.
"My eyes got to be the size of saucers," Dr. Karen Maples told The Los Angeles Times, explaining her reaction to the last birth. "We just went on and delivered the babies."
She said the babies were in stable condition and would probably remain in the hospital for at least two months. She said the mother should be released in a week.
Kaiser spokeswoman Myra Suarez said she could not release any information about the mother, including her condition or whether she used fertility drugs. Such drugs make multiple births more likely.
"They are all doing the best they can," Suarez told the AP.
The first baby was born at 10:43 a.m.; the eighth one at 10:48 a.m.</blockquote>
