    <title>[PI] Sprites help. Rank Icons</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-sprites-help-rank-icons/430482</link>
    <description>Hey everyone. I am having a little problem with the InsidiaX source. It is not that big of an issue, but I can find nothing wrong. Now the problem is the player rights = 4
is suppose to be donar rank, yet in chat it shows a Mod crown, even thought the donator sprite is present in the cache. In the client.java the modicons all seem to be set to the right one including Donator one, yet in game it shows it wrong. Any help would be appreciated.</description>
