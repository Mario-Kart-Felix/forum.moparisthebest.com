    <title>NPC Barrier and underattack after death. Help requested</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-barrier-and-underattack-after-death-help-requested/142839</link>
    <description>Alright, I&#39;m sure this is a common problem with most server sources, but when you attack an npc lets say.. in a heavily objected area.. no matter where you run it follows you.. right? Well.. it&#39;ll even walk through buildings and things designated as unwalkable. Does anyone have the slightest idea how to set an object or areas in the map unwalkable to an NPC.. not a player, i&#39;m aware of barriers for players, also.. should you attack an NPC and die and it isn&#39;t killed it will follow you to your respawn and attack you.. Does anyone have the slightest idea how to set a trigger on death to prevent that NPC from staying focused on you and just returning to it&#39;s original position?

If there is a tutorial on this please point the url to me, I&#39;ve searched and didn&#39;t see anything turn up. Thanks.</description>

              <p>Well this is a server source from a year ago, I’ve just kept it up with the times myself rather than download a newer one, not saying I haven’t borrowed snippets here and there. It’s completely compatible with Silab’s client, If I could fix this problem, then I could move on to bigger things heh. So… anyone who has the slightest idea or hint, just point it out to me and I’ll check it out thanks.</p>
