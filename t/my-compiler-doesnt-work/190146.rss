    <title>My compiler doesn&#39;t work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-compiler-doesnt-work/190146</link>
    <description>Hi, I recently downloaded a source and the compiler doesn&#39;t work on it. It says that I don&#39;t have JDK 5.0 or JDK 6.0 or JDK 5.0 or JDK 6.0 with updates, but I have JDK 6.0 update 5.

I did that thing on Mod Taharoks tutorial where it said how to fix that &quot;Path could not be specified&quot; but the compiler still isn&#39;t working.</description>
