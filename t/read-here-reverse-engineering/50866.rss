    <description>Lets face it,
You ain&#39;t going to create a Runescape Bot or modify the Runescape Client without Learning how to Reverse Engineer Applications. Here in the link below will set your mind free with all kinds of stuff for modifying and reverse engineering applications.

Heres a quote from the section Introduction/Have a Goal!
&lt;blockquote&gt;Have a goal

None of the information in this book will be integrated into your thought process, or even retained, if you do not have some reason for reading it. Pick a program for which you want to figure out some small piece of it so that you can do something interesting. Maybe you want to replace a function call in an app to make it do something different, maybe you want to implement a particular feature of a program somewhere else, maybe you want to monitor all data before a program encrypts it and sends it across the network, [b]or maybe you just want to cheat at your favorite multiplayer networked game.[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>If you can handle the 90s net philosophy that infuses everything related to ORC &amp; HCU and the random bursts of non-English (occasionally dead) languages, that’s probably the largest repository of practical reversing on the internet. I <span class="bbcode-i">still</span> learn things from randomly browsing it, nowhere near finished and I’ve been doing it for maybe a year or two now (though not consistently).</p>
