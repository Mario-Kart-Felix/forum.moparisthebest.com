    <title>[PI] Running - Help with configs and such?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-running-help-with-configs-and-such/522789</link>
    <description>Let me rewrite this. I didn&#39;t like how I worded it.

So my client has 2 run buttons.
The little orb run button, which is case 152. - Will be referred to as &quot;Orb button&quot;
And then the run button within the settings tab, which is case 74214. - Will be referred to as &quot;Run button&quot;

What I would like to happen is that when you turn one of the buttons above on, they both turn on, and vice versa.

But before I get there, I need to fix my run :s

Regardless of what button I click, or what options I have, my character runs :o.

Currently, I only have the Orb button added into my ClickingButtons.java:
[code=java]
			case 152:
				if (c.runEnergy &lt; 1) {
					c.isRunning = false;
					c.getPA().setConfig(173, 0);
					return;
				}
				c.isRunning = !c.isRunning;
				c.getPA().setConfig(173, c.isRunning ? 0 : 1);
			break;
[/code]
Now, I don&#39;t exactly see an issue, and this code has worked for others (I stole this part from a tutorial).
But it just doesn&#39;t like me I guess.</description>
