    <title>&#39;SinScape&#39; ? New name later maybe :P</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sinscape-new-name-later-maybe-p/117755</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve decided to make a quick one day project. You just download a client, open it, make a character and play. Nothing else.

I&#39;ll be coding the server, but to make this work correctly I&#39;ll need a person that&#39;s very good at making clients.

The client coder needs to be able to:
Add Item Masks
NPC Masks
Have it go directly to a certain IP (If you have no clue I can do it) with no other way to put a different IP in
Correctly change the name of the client
Change colors of the HP bar
Change the colors of the loading bar (in the client)

I&#39;ll go over it with you more when your chosen

Seriously, I need a good client coder, just tell me how good you are and why I should choose you.</description>
