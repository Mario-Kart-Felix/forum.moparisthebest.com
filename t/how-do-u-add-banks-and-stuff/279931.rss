    <title>How do u add banks and stuff</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-u-add-banks-and-stuff/279931</link>
    <description>I have a few questions about autospawn, npc&#39;s, and world objects.  Please answer them if you can  

Ok first, I wanted to know how you spawn an npc, so he is stationary.  I know that you go into autospawnand then add him to the list, with his id and stuff, but when I compile, and then turn my server on, the server messes up, and it won&#39;t log in.  So could you tell me how to correctly autospawn an npc.

Ok, the other question:  I was wondering how you make, say like, a bank appear.  When I go into global objects, and insert the numbers and compile, then turn my server on, the bank is not there, as if i never typed it into the global objects thing.

Ok that&#39;s about it. Thx for your time.</description>

              <p>When you are adding the Npc in autospawn you have to use the tab key. if you hit space a bunch of times it won’t work. I had the same problem <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>To add global objects go in client.java and search for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void NewObjects() {</code></pre>
<p>Then add your objects under that like this:</p>
<p><code>public void NewObjects() {
                         makeGlobalObject(3568, 9677, 1747, 0, 10); 
                         makeGlobalObject(2347, 3700, 2485, 0, 10);
                         makeGlobalObject(2347, 3695, 2482, 0, 10);
                         makeGlobalObject(2347, 3691, 2481, 0, 10);</code></p>
<p>The first to numbers are the X and Y coords, the third number is the object id and idk what the last 2 are but i just always put 0 and ten <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
