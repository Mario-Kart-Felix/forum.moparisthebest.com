    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-good-coder-for-my-server-or-someone-who-will-teach-me-how-to-code/41009</link>
    <description>Hello, some of you may remember my server and if you have great coding experience please pm me on moparisthebest.com/smf. and tell me and then I will see if you would be a good help. Oh and also I need a coder for both servers or just one coder that can code both (non pk and pk servers.)

Also, I need someone to teach me coding, I know I will not learn it in one day but it would be very much appreciated if someone would teach me as I said in the first request I would very much like it if you pmed me.

Thank you very much, shadow hearts
