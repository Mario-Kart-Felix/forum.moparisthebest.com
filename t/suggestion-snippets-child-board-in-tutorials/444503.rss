    <title>Suggestion: Snippets child board in tutorials</title>

    <description>The current snippet section: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,338418.0.html

-I&#39;ll be honest with you guys. I go on other websites to check for helpful snippets because I can&#39;t find anything I am looking for in that topic. Sure, I can search through it but that really isn&#39;t very good. The topic is unorganized.

-I think a child board should be added into the tutorial board and it should be for snippets.
People are always coming up with small snippets but people really don&#39;t want to post it in the &quot;snippets section&quot; that we currently have. Users are often discouraged and unmotivated to post in the current &quot;section.&quot;
The tutorial and snippets section should be booming and filled with new posts everyday but they are not.
--The average user would also appreciate the additional board because he could then find things that he is looking for easier and he will probably find some beneficial snippets that he would never have found before.</description>

<p>Well a board will be fine I suppose. It becomes difficult to see the line between “regular tutorial” and “snippet” when you have another board for “fantastic tutorials.” You can see the slight confusion around the edges here.</p>

<p>They can always be moved around easily, though. Basically a regular tutorial is something more in depth with a lot of code. A snippet will be something that doesn’t require much explaination and is very short.</p>
<p>The “fantastic tutorials” could also contain some well done or important snippets that are very popular or just impress staff.</p>

<p>My original idea was to create a child board from tutorials specifically for snippets. However, we’ve gone through a lot of discussion over the years on why a snippets board is poor. The best way to solve most of the issues is to anonymize all snippet posts. Essentially, you wouldn’t see people’s profiles attached to snippets. This way, they gain no post stats, no rep, and little to no recognition for the snippets. It’s just a generic contribution to the website for speedy lookups. Whether this board requires pre-approval for posting is another matter entirely.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t really agree with that system because it would basically be the snippets section we have today.</p>
<p>Snippets are meant to be small tutorials but they should still play the same role tutorials do. It could be just as big of a board, if not bigger because people are normally making small snippets, not large tutorials.</p>

              <p>Yeah I agree as well. The snippet topic is a poor substitute for a board. Although, referring to another suggestion, I would rather a ‘general rsps tutorial board’ and then have another board for excellent tutorials. I don’t feel snippets need their own section, but rather should be allowed in the current section.</p>
