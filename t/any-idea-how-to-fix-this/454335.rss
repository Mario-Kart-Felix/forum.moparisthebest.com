    <title>Any Idea how to fix this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-idea-how-to-fix-this/454335</link>
    <description>Okay so I made the .Jar file for my server. Works perfectly for me . But when I send it out to my friends. It will Download the cache , but as it goes to actually load the game. It stops at like 40% and says requesting 2D graphics. Was there something I&#39;m missing in my folder with all the CLASS files? Or ? What&#39;s going on.

thanks guys.</description>

              <p>I already have a directory for the cache. It’s just I think I may be missing something that deals with 2D Graphics. I honestly don’t know. But one thing I do know. Is that it downloads the cache and it goes to the C:/ .</p>
<p>EDIT : Still in need of help . Would much appreciate if anyone could over teamviewer.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Dougyb, post:5, topic:454335”]No I haven’t tried to make a webclient. I just tried to .Jar it. I’ve followed many guides. They all say to put the input directory as your folder with all the CLASS Files in it. So I did and it worked just fine for me. But when I sent it to friends it gave me the same problem. I just don’t know if i’m missing something that has anything to do with 2d graphics?</p>
<p>If it is my cache packed incorrectly? How would I fix that.</p>

<p>Well if you are going to JAR a file you need to make a separate directory for the cache files (C Drive). It is the exact same thing as creating a webclient, you just don’t put it on the website. You would upload it and allow others to download it. Follow this webclient tutorial here &gt; <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,336494.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,336494.0.html</a></p>

<p>Did you follow some type of tutorial to turn this into a webclient? If so you might have packed the cache wrong.</p>
