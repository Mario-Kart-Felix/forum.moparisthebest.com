    <title>Adding global(?) objects to region clipping? [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-global-objects-to-region-clipping-pi/508918</link>
    <description>Well, I recently added region clipping to my server, including a new clipped firemaking.
Everything is working perfectly. Just 1 minor issue. I have objects loaded via ObjectManager.java (not the one from the tutorial I followed). They aren&#39;t included to the clipping method, meaning a player can still no-clip through some objects.

Here&#39;s the tut I followed: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=527173.0
I don&#39;t think the firemaking one is needed here, but yeah.</description>
