    <title>Help with item deletion</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-item-deletion/319875</link>
    <description>Hey... My friend and I are running a server and we need help... When we get partyhats, santa hats, masks, the custom version of those items, and some other customs, they get deleted after the restart.. if I wear a partyhat, then 15 minutes later after restart it dissapears. There&#39;s a deleterares file but when I put my name in there or remove the item ids and compile it, it still deletes them... I have the caliberscape source if anyone has ever used it... So someone please help if you can. If you can&#39;t... -.-[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 18, 2009, 01:23:36 pm[/size][hr]h3lp</description>
