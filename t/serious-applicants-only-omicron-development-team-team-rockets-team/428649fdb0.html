        <p>I would like to remind everybody that this is an application thread for a client developer. Not for an argument of what has and/or not been done. Arguments relating to the matter of added content or the knowledge of the developers should be directed in a private messaage towards that specific member. The staff at Omicron work daily on this development and at this time is the only information that can be given out. When more information can be given out publicly it will be passed out at that particular time.</p>

        <p>You guys act like you are rocket scientists when the things that you guys have asked for are very trivial and not so rocket-science-y. The cloak of secrecy is a marketing act and people really shouldn’t care as to what or how you are doing things because it is most likely:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">very trivial and not so rocket-science-y</code></pre>
<p>things. This comes from an evaluation of the owner and the people he has been looking for. I see the idea of incompetency in the future and a continued let down feeling for people who are drawn in from false advertising. Given, smart man but he doesn’t have any clue as to what he is getting into and the vast amount of knowledge the people he will need to look for are located. Frankly, the people who he is looking for might not actually want to do it. Client hacking is tough. Very few people understand the dynamics and history behind how the client works and why Jagex has updated the client in certain matters rather than others. It is crucial that you do client hack, to learn such patterns so that you are not constrained to one or two engines. From my little knowledge of how this project is running, I will continue to express a feeling of disappointment and humor towards this project.  The owner is arrogant and is disregarding a large volume of advice from people who are both experience and more knowledgeable than he is. Well mostly arrogant.  I have yet to see your skill, Team_Rocket so lets not bash people will false claims. Respect isn’t earned from nothing.</p>
<p>You guys are another project who has given themselves a feeling that they are the only project who knows what they are doing when there are plenty of people I can call on right now who do know more than your entire team put together. Congratulations.</p>
<p>Stop kissing their feet.</p>

<p>There is no “secrecy” being done. It is the factor that the server will have several features not seen on other servers. Until our server has gone into public playing Omicron wanted to keep the main ideas hidden until a point where the head developer/founder wished to show these features.</p>
<p>I, myself, have witnessed a couple of features already added and I can say that TR DOES know what he is doing. I support the fact that he wishes to keep the development ideas and goals secret. Why do you think there was has not been an actual server development page yet? Because, the developer is not ready yet to release those ideas for others to view and “start making their own versions of.”</p>
<p>I guess to be fair, I can understand anybody’s concern that a hidden product is hard to follow blindly, especially by somebody who has not really “proven” themselves on a community. I at first even had doubts I openly admit that but my mind has already been changed. Until the main developer wishes to disclose more information nothing can be said.</p>
<p>There is no “marketing” or “financial” intent in this thread. The main developer has the financial capabilities to say the least. He would have no need in “making money” from such a secrecy.</p>

<p>I, myself, have witnessed a couple of features already added and I can say that TR DOES know what he is doing. I support the fact that he wishes to keep the development ideas and goals secret. Why do you think there was has not been an actual server development page yet? Because, the developer is not ready yet to release those ideas for others to view and “start making their own versions of.”</p>
<p>I guess to be fair, I can understand anybody’s concern that a hidden product is hard to follow blindly, especially by somebody who has not really “proven” themselves on a community. I at first even had doubts I openly admit that but my mind has already been changed. Until the main developer wishes to disclose more information nothing can be said.</p>
<p>There is no “marketing” or “financial” intent in this thread. The main developer has the financial capabilities to say the least. He would have no need in “making money” from such a secrecy.[/quote]</p>
<p>Terrible persuasive argument since you just tried to comfort my worries and then totally went off point. Don’t “”, it’s really annoying and makes you seem like you are above someone especially in the context of the way you put it.</p>
<blockquote>There is no "secrecy" being done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is the factor that the server will have several features not seen on other servers.</blockquote>
<p>Respect that but my opinion is who cares.</p>
<blockquote>Why do you think there was has not been an actual server development page yet?</blockquote>
<p>From personal experience you really don’t need one. If you are going to do a project just do a damn project.</p>
<blockquote>I at first even had doubts I openly admit that but my mind has already been changed.</blockquote>
<p>Personal opinion, next please.</p>
<p>The basis of the “representatives” counter argument was that they don’t want to disclose things so that you guys copy them and go around and do it. My opinion, who gives a shit. The idea is not the final product and if you tell people and they do it better than you did, it’s usually better for the world in a general standpoint. Having funding is good but is not really important to tell anyone. Again, bullshit marketing strategy or arrogant points to try and make people think that you know what you are doing.</p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
<p>Guy doesn’t understand aside and subtle points that the OP and owner is trying to display. Missed the points of noted arrogance, general lack of knowledge, and other important pieces that I added to my post. Maybe we should get back to those and debate on those accordingly.</p>
<p>Also I missed to say that you had terrible reasoning that he is not making money because he already has money therefore why wouldn’t he want to release ideas. No sense made there. Such a person wouldn’t disclose ideas for the purposes of marketing because if other servers have it then they can market it as well. Which then leads back to money/volume of interest, totally beside what you said.</p>

<p>team rocket hiding all of these unfathomable and amazing updates that distinguishes his game from every other game.</p>

<p>honestly i don’t see anything unique about a constants.java or utilizing the winsock API for a platform-dependent (without wrapping it) socket implementation.</p>

        <p>I’ll let T_R come settle this, but for now I’ll speak on behalf of the project.<br>
We’re currently doing heavy development and have nothing that we wish to share or make public to the community yet.<br>
When the time comes that we do, hopefully you’ll find more respect for it as much as the team that is working on it does.</p>
<p>As members of the team, we hear updates, what’s going to be done, and how we’re going to get from point A to point B.</p>
<p>As said above, this thread isn’t about going on about what we’ve done, are going to do, it’s about recruiting a client developer. So I would think that all the talk about content is “off-topic” and we really don’t need it in here.</p>
<p>Take it to PM, because we’re just looking for a client developer and not an argument about our content.</p>

<p>It is off topic when a moderator steps in and then says it is off topic. I would like my points that I have presented to be explained or set to rest. It’s something that you really shouldn’t ignore since I just called your project a waste of time and went out on the limb to say your leader does not know what he is doing.</p>

<p>Indeed.<br>
No one but the staff knows what’s going on right now, so if you’re recruited you’ll be brought up to speed.</p>

<p>As am I. (Not like the whole debating would be in good favor) But I love the people who are coming on here and saying ‘our’ it is our project with then going around and saying that it is secret hush hush. This is getting humorous.</p>
<p>This team rocket fellow is a nice guy but maybe, a word of warning to all of you, the guy you don’t want to get associated with. Just from people posting I see a huge manipulation problem folding out and that is just from observation. That is where most of the humor of watching this thread developing comes in. Where is the development! Hahaha. Continue on, continue on.</p>
