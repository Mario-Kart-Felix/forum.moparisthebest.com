<ol>
<li>A new team that needs developers to start. With this type of server I look for some basic information, like the base and such. I don’t usually look for any proof of development.</li>
<li>An existing project that needs new developers to continue. I look for proof of existing development as well as the basic information. Asking people to join a pre-existing project that has already been developed on is bad practice, without giving them more information (like pictures or at least lists of what has been done).</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Both</span> of these are different than the ‘Server Development’ section, which needs proof to be posted at all, as it’s basically a show off board.</p>
<p>I think if this has such ‘secret’ content, you should use more ‘secret’ methods of recruiting people. As in, look for people yourself, instead of making people apply for a server they know nothing about. In other words, this is server type <span class="hashtag">#2</span>, so you should post some proof of development (proof that you will ‘succeed’) if you want to keep your thread open.[/quote]</p>
<p>Close it up, I’ve got what I need. Infexis of R-S will most likely be our Client Developer.</p>
