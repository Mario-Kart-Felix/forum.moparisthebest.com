    <description>[b]How many would you like to cook?[/b]

Does anyone know how to add the picture of the item that you are trying to cook to the cook-X interface?  i got everything working, but just don&#39;t know what frame or w/e to use to change the picture.  You know like how you do it on smelt-x, but for cook-x.  

I tried searching, and i can&#39;t even find anything about cook-x at all, so then i tried to use the thing like for smithing to set item picture, but that&#39;s diff.  

[br][size=1]Posted at: November 15, 2006, 04:39:50 PM[/size][hr]well no luck finding anything yet.  I now have the fletching working too with the &quot;How many would you like to make?&quot; but same problem there, no pictures.  i was wondering if maybe the thing i need is a frame number or something.  i know on npc dialogue, to show your picture u send a frame, but since this is an interface not sure.  [br][size=1]Posted at: November 20, 2006, 10:00:37 PM[/size][hr]ok now i have tanning also working and crafting soft leather, but tanning, still needs pictures, and not sure on exactly how to use the interfaces, to change picture or text for the hide name and cost.  

so far i have 3 interfaces that i need to figure out how to change pictures for, and i think the procedure will be the same...next is crafting dragon hides[br][size=1]Posted at: November 21, 2006, 11:16:35 PM[/size][hr]ok now i have spinning wheel make x working now too, this not having picture thing is annoying, and i&#39;ve tried a few more ways, and still nothing.  am i the only one that is trying to get these types of things working right?  I got them working, just not the picture.  [br][size=1]Posted at: November 28, 2006, 04:10:21 PM[/size][hr]ok I FINALLY figured it out, thanks everyone for responding, and trying to help me....*cough* NOT *cough*.  anyways, will someone please have an admin delete this topic or atleast lock it.  it&#39;s solved.</description>
