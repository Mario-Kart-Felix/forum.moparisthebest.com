    <description>ok guys, its the same problem but my port foward is correct this time, and i have the torvapkz v2 source and client, PI. i think i have to change the ip in GUI.java as well, cause i already changed it in client.java, is this correct? cause my friend is still getting error connecting.


maybe when i sent him the client i sent somthing wrong? cause i took the java files out and left the class files. i think thats wrong, i did so becuase i didnt want people editing. im confused.

i got people ready to play if someone could help me i will reward u. :(</description>
