    <title>Shop Error! Need someone to help code</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shop-error-need-someone-to-help-code/366979</link>
    <description>Hi. I am teaching myself to code but can&#39;t get everything to work. I am currently trying to add shops and everytime i add a shop there is an error when i try to run my server and will not let me log into the server with any account. I need a coder who could help me with this and code in the shops while also fixing the error. If anyone can help then please comment.
Kind Regards,
Getting Icy</description>
