You’re spamming the admin’s inbox.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">(Dylock) reports come in faster then i can deal with them
(s|l) Are they from moparisthebest.com or the other place?
(Dylock) mostly moparscape
(s|l) Fegs there can't take criticism. Fegs there don't know how to use javac either.
(s|l) Meh, the MoparScape noobs can sit in their self-created shitpit. They don't need moderation.
(Dylock) gaa ive done over 50 reports im done for now
(s|l) Thank you milord, your beauty has saved this beast.</code></pre>

<p>Well. Em, New1 you are more correct logically than curse.</p>

<li>Curse he didn’t do anything wrong, this forum is for “Client Help or Questions.”<br>
As long as furyscape uses a client; This thread is logically correct.</li>
