Trying to Require: Spawn Npc From Object on a Timer

Images: No

Where Downloaded: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,391699.0.html

Hello, If someone could Help me with Making a Monster Spawn from an Object. Ex. Monkey from a statue with a timer. I saw this on another source in the Download section before. I didnt download because i didnt think it was a a good base. But Now im trying to come up with a Mini-Game witch i need that, but i dont know where to start to make Npc&#39;s Spawn from Objects.

Sorry if this is really easy, or/has been posted about. How-ever, i&#39;ve tried to make a Code as like Barrows but i dont want to Press the Object Before hand they spawn. Perhaps the code can be modified on a timer?</description>

              <p>well, the objects have nothing to do with it, just add a timer called like npcspawn1 and have it so when it hits 0 spawnannpc then the npc id, I could help you more with timers and stuff if you need</p>

<p>Edit: More than 1 spawning at a time, Like spawning off Pest control. But with Diffrent Objects and a timer for each monster. Like a spinner after 5 seconds. Then after 10 seconds a brawler. from that same Portal. But i want to do it with diffrent Monsters, and Objects. Or could i use Pest control as a base for that?</p>
