    <title>To skip, or not to skip?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/to-skip-or-not-to-skip/173475</link>
    <description>   Outside, there is currently 3ft of snow in my front yard, even more in the back. The roads have had salt dropped on them all night, now we have about an inch of ice on 3 of the major road around here. We got a 2 hour delay(wtf?), even though News Channels are complaining it is too dangerous to be out and we should all stay inside. People who are getting home from work are driving 10~15mph on a major highway. I swear, sometimes my school is retarded.</description>

              <p>My school did that once, except it was only about half a foot of snow, but still an inch of ice on the roads. We had a 2 hour delay. When we went, we almost rear-ended someone trying to stop so I could get out. My dad told me to jump out because he was just going to keep going. Many people fell that day, but none of them got more than a few bruises.</p>

My school is like that too, one time the heaters were broken and it was actually -5 degrees on the first floor. Some people just left [I could have just walked home but I stayed].</p>
