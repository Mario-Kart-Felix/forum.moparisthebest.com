    <title>[PI] Being seen as an npc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-being-seen-as-an-npc/521926</link>
    <description>Normally when you hover over or right click a player their username shows in white and their combat level shows red or green depending on your combat level to theirs. When you hover over an npc their username turns out to be yellow. I was wondering how you guys would make it so to a specific player their username shows yellow as to look like if they were an npc.</description>
