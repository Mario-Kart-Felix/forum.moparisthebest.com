    <title>How to make an npc say: &quot;Owner Is Online ! Or Offline !&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-an-npc-say-owner-is-online-or-offline/290045</link>
    <description>I would like to know that because people are asking: Does the Owner is Online ? And they could know it. I would like to know a code and where to place it. I&#39;m use DeltaScape&#39;s base.

Thanks.</description>
