Back up after 4 years!

-------------------------------------------[SIZE=4][B]The Server[/B][/SIZE]----------------------------------------
I used to run this server back in 2012 and had a big fan-base. It was a ton of fun, and now I am proud to announce it is back, 24/7! 

[b]My aim:[/b]
To host and run a RSPS that creates the feeling of wanting to strive forward and obtain the best gear in the game by PKing and playing in general. Back in 2012, I had it up as a project, I was young at the time and I was just learning java. As my knowledge in Java and programming in general has increased, so has my ability to add new things and make the server more fun for the players. To reach my goal I will take advice from the best, and do MY best to make this a great server and improve it from its already-great level!

[b]Why this could be the right RSPS for you:[/b]
This could be the one for you because of the competition and the awesome PKing. If you are a great Pker, or want to get better at it and experience it in a fun server with your favorite weapons from RS2, this is the server for you. The combat is well-done, there is all three spellbooks, and a well-balanced economy so that you can set goals for your PKing and what you want to get, and achieve them.
-------------------------------------------[SIZE=4][B]Summary[/B][/SIZE]----------------------------------------
Dubeast-Pkz is a 317, Edgeville based PK server, filled with awesome, newer weapons that were added in later Runescape. The PvP armor sets, Dragon Claws, all the chaotic weapons, the Korasi Sword, you name it! These premium weapons are what to strive for in this server, for they are all purchasable by PK points. The server has perfect combat, too, making the PKing even better.
