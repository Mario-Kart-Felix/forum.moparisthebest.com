    <title>Damage randomization?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/damage-randomization/41298</link>
    <description>I&#39;m working on a possible reverse engineering, any information regarding the system of randomization on rs would be greatly loved.

I am looking for:

1.How private rs clients randomize damage (hopefully this will be easy, someone must know : p)
2.How seeding scripts (If used) are assigned ingame (by server, by player, by area etc...)
3.What the specific client side data input is
4.When the scripts restart (never, at login, at updates, weekly, monthly....)
5.How gear and stat effects are applied to the seeded number (Damage chart?, another seed?)
6.How many such charts are applied and how they interact
7.Exactly what the extent of client side work is (Anything to do with anything random basicly.)

Thanks, the more of these that I can get answered the better. I hope you good gentlemen can be of help.

              <p>Hmmm that’s useful and slightly discouraging at the same time. What data input does the client recieve?</p>
<p>Edit:What section does this belong in?</p>
