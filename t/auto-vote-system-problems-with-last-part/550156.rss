    <description>Ok, so i have added an auto voting system everything has gone smoothly besides the server sided part.
I know i have to convert it to my source (delta), but it&#39;s telling me that it can&#39;t find some variables such as the &quot;username&quot; for the and i don&#39;t know what to do because i think it&#39;s on the website side of it. any ways here&#39;s some information if i need any more let me know please.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Vote.java:28: error: cannot find symbol
    if (checkVote(player.getUsername())) {
                        ^
  symbol:   method getUsername()
  location: variable player of type Player
Vote.java:29: error: cannot find symbol
        int tokens = getVotes(player.getUsername()); //Number of times this user
 has voted. Number of unclaimed votes.
                                    ^
  symbol:   method getUsername()
  location: variable player of type Player
Vote.java:33: error: cannot find symbol
        player.getInventory().additem(995, 50000 * tokens); // adds 50,000 * tok
en amount of coins to the player&#39;s inventory.
              ^
  symbol:   method getInventory()
  location: variable player of type Player
Vote.java:36: error: cannot find symbol
        removeVotes(player.getUsername());
                          ^
  symbol:   method getUsername()
  location: variable player of type Player
Vote.java:38: error: cannot find symbol
        player.sM(&quot;You either have not voted, already claimed your reward, or th
ere was an error.&quot;);
              ^
  symbol:   method sM(String)
  location: variable player of type Player
Vote.java:39: error: cannot find symbol
        player.sM(&quot;Either try again in a few minutes, or contact a staff member.
&quot;);
              ^
  symbol:   method sM(String)
  location: variable player of type Player
6 errors
Press any key to continue . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And here&#39;s my code in the vote.java file

&lt;blockquote&gt;public static void claimVote(Player player) {
    createConnection();
    if (checkVote(player.getUsername())) {
        int tokens = getVotes(player.getUsername()); //Number of times this user has voted. Number of unclaimed votes.
 
        //methods for giving rewards to players goes here.
        //for example, I might give a user 50,000 coins per 1 time they voted, so I would do:
        player.getInventory().addItem(995, 50000 * tokens); // adds 50,000 * token amount of coins to the player&#39;s inventory.
 
        //remove votes after user as claimed.
        removeVotes(player.getUsername());
    } else {
        player.sM(&quot;You either have not voted, already claimed your reward, or there was an error.&quot;);
        player.sM(&quot;Either try again in a few minutes, or contact a staff member.&quot;);
    }
}&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>The 3 errors you have is because getPlayerID() returns an Integer.[/quote]</p>
<p>i have already tried that many times…<br>
playerName does not work.</p>
<p>And i put “getplayerID()” because i was trying many things, because first of all you told me to put in sendMessage which is not even in my delta it’s sM then you said something about there being a similar public String playerName; which there is not so. No disrespect i’m ok with this i don’t need it i will keep messing with it myself thank’s for your effort.</p>

<p>Thanks and i can’t seem to find a getplayername method either it only seem’s to have a getplayerid but when i use that method it tell’s me it can’t be used in the situation. I’m down to three error’s all based on getUsername/ getPlayername neither work + iv’e searched for any “get” methods and there’s none hmm i’m stumped lol and also It is sM i just moved the whole static method to client.java and made it a regular void so now that part works. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

Ok but i don’t understand where to import getusername from because i’m pretty sure it’s referring to mysql where it asks for the username to see if they voted and i don’t know how to do that :x sorry, not asking to be spoon feed just a little more instructions if you could thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>And here’s my code in the vote.java file</p>

    //remove votes after user as claimed.
    removeVotes(player.getUsername());
} else {
