              <p>thank you for the feedback we will be fixing ALL of this soon.<br>
the bosses do drop stuff just have to keep killing them for the good drop.<br>
the hp bars do not reset, the bosses just have more hitpoint bars.<br>
and for the teleports i will speak to the owner about. he will fix it immediately.<br>
the barrows is a little glitched; but will be fixed. again this is a new server it is very buggy but will be fixed.</p>
<p>again thanks for the feedback this will be fixed. ~instinx.</p>

              <p>It seemed pretty cool, though I left because of these points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teleports don’t always work, using the yak’s teleport teleported me home ~5 times, and to the yak’s once. Each time after teleporting to rock crabs, I have to relog before I can tele there again.</li>
<li>The combat level isn’t changed until I relog, so at one point I had 70 range at a combat level of 3.</li>
<li>After I thought I killed a boss, its HP bar was full again and I had to do a lot of more damage before it was empty again. This happened on several bosses. I hate that…</li>
<li>The bosses didn’t drop anything, not even bones. After doing a round of barrows, clicking on the chest only teleported me out and didnt give me any reward at all. IDK whether this is bad luck or that it’s just not programmed to drop anything (yet).</li>
<li>The camera doesn’t flow smoothly like on other RSPS’s.</li>
<li>There were only a few people online. I have seen one regular player, one owner and 2 mods in 1 hour. Owner told me that there are ~12 people online in the evening, but that’s not when I usually play.</li>
<li>Owner told me he coded most of the server, but it looks a lot like a different server</li>
</ul>
