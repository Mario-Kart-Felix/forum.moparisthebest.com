    <title>Can&#39;t install windows back over Ubuntu</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-install-windows-back-over-ubuntu/428129</link>
    <description>First of all, I&#39;m trying to flash my BIOS. My AC Adapter for my laptop isn&#39;t working. I looked it up on the dell support site and they said my BIOS may be out of date. The file they gave to flash the BIOS is an exe so I tried running it through wine but it won&#39;t work. It gives me an error. I decided that I&#39;d just install windows XP real quick just so I could flash my BIOS but when I use the reinstall disk it tells me that there are no valid partitions on my hard drive and the set up can&#39;t continue. What should I do? I just want to charge the replacement laptop battery I got for christmas...  :(</description>

              <p>shrink your ubuntu install’s partition(s) to free up some space, install xp in the free space, repair grub with the utility provided with ubuntu, all is well.</p>
<p>ps: you’re supposed to burn the executable to a disk/create a bootable flash/floppy to flash your bios.</p>
