    <description>O.K so i added a server command to where when i do ::restart it updates the server automatically and my fiance&#39; can do the ::restart command also, and it works but only the problem is that it don&#39;t actually update the server as to when i do it.. 

i&#39;m trying to figure out how can i go about making it so she and I both can either do the command and it update the server from both PC&#39;s or code it in some how?</description>

              <p>Neither of those commands re-execute the environment.<br>
In the first one, you simply save all the players and then tell the System to exit.<br>
In the second, you’re just changing a few values for some variables.</p>

<p>The command should work the same regardless of the pc you executed it on.<br>
What could be an issue is the actual code within your server.<br>
The update command just sets a couple of booleans to true, and then an integer to a defined number.<br>
The actual “update” is executed when the timer hits 0. Which on most servers, just shuts it down.<br>
If you wanted it to re-execute the server, you’d have to code it in yourself.</p>

<p>Yeah i was trying to use part of my restart command to make it work with ::update but it didn’t work lol any idea ?<br>

Helps if you actually post some code.[/quote]</p>
<p>here’s the restart command i use… and my update one as well.</p>
<p><code>if (playerCommand.startsWith("restart") &amp;&amp; c.playerRights == 3) {
	for(Player p : PlayerHandler.players) {
		if(p == null)
		         continue;						
		PlayerSave.saveGame((Client)p);
	}
System.exit(0);
	}</code></p>
<p>Update</p>
<p><code>if (playerCommand.startsWith("update")) {
				String[] args = playerCommand.split(" ");
				int a = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
				PlayerHandler.updateSeconds = a;
				PlayerHandler.updateAnnounced = false;
				PlayerHandler.updateRunning = true;
				PlayerHandler.updateStartTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
			}</code></p>
