    <title>Sorry for re-post .. but this one better</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sorry-for-re-post-but-this-one-better/62416</link>
    <description>I need a link or the code for normal magic and/or ancients, because my normal magic only works on people, but only hits 0&#39;s on them, same applies with attacking npcs. Ancient magic is also the same, it only hits 0 on players and also only 0 on monsters, only ice barrage seems to work on people.

could someone please help me fix it, or atleast give me a link that would help me deal with the problem

i need a fix for ancient on players , and also need a fix for normal magic on monsters</description>
