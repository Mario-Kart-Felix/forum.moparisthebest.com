    <title>RuneUnited Development Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runeunited-development-team/541347</link>
    <description>Project [b]RuneUnited[/b] was running at year 2007 for several months, it was very successful.

The statistics were just amazing:
[i]Over 60,000 accounts made.
Over 300 accounts online.
Enormous update every day.
Live Support 24/7.
Bugs reported were fixed within hours.
Strong dedicated server in Europe and in Canada.
And - the biggest, strongest team of staff.
[/i]

After I moved from America to Israel I shutoff the server and told everyone that server will be coming back in a week. 
It never did... 
my team mates left the project, and I became all alone on it. 
Today, after 6 years, I want to continue this project with a strong team that knows what they are doing.
I am not looking to be bossy or something, I am looking for people that we can become friends and run this project smoothly.

Currently the project is at 1% progress, my ambition to do so is the 1%.
What was real successful about this project was the fact that We were a team of 18 people that were all excited about it and contributed to it in any way they could, I believe we can do it again.
So I am opening the project again for anyone who has skills to offer to join:
Even if you only know how to build websites, do graphics, work on source, work on client etc... 
I will want to be a team mate with you because you have a skill.
I really do hope so RuneUnited will be back to it&#39;s original form and evolve.

I have a made a raidcall channel for the Project, all feel free to join it, ID: 8386562 - Online</description>

              <p>I dropped in the raidcall channel, and no one was in there. If you’re interested in a website developer, drop me a message and I’ll hop in raidcall when you get on.</p>
