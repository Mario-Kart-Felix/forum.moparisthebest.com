        <p>Project <span class="bbcode-b">RuneUnited</span> was running at year 2007 for several months, it was very successful.</p>
<p>The statistics were just amazing:<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Over 60,000 accounts made.<br>
Over 300 accounts online.<br>
Enormous update every day.<br>
Live Support 24/7.<br>
Bugs reported were fixed within hours.<br>
Strong dedicated server in Europe and in Canada.<br>
And - the biggest, strongest team of staff.<br>
</span></p>
<p>After I moved from America to Israel I shutoff the server and told everyone that server will be coming back in a week.<br>
It never did…<br>
my team mates left the project, and I became all alone on it.<br>
Today, after 6 years, I want to continue this project with a strong team that knows what they are doing.<br>
I am not looking to be bossy or something, I am looking for people that we can become friends and run this project smoothly.</p>
<p>Currently the project is at 1% progress, my ambition to do so is the 1%.<br>
What was real successful about this project was the fact that We were a team of 18 people that were all excited about it and contributed to it in any way they could, I believe we can do it again.<br>
So I am opening the project again for anyone who has skills to offer to join:<br>
Even if you only know how to build websites, do graphics, work on source, work on client etc…<br>
I will want to be a team mate with you because you have a skill.<br>
I really do hope so RuneUnited will be back to it’s original form and evolve.</p>
<p>I have a made a raidcall channel for the Project, all feel free to join it, ID: 8386562 - Online</p>
