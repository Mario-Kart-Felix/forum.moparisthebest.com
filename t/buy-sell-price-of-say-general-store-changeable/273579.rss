    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buy-sell-price-of-say-general-store-changeable/273579</link>
    <description>I want too make a new shop on a server (i can do this easily) where abouts can i change the buy and sell prices? and maybe change the shops that will buy this item? Also the shops may buy EVERY ITEM back with a certain discount, say 40 percent, how can i change this for just the one item too not do this?

Thanks in advance.</description>
