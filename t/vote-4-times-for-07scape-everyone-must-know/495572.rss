    <title>VOTE 4 TIMES for 07scape! EVERYONE MUST KNOW</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vote-4-times-for-07scape-everyone-must-know/495572</link>
    <description>Hello, You may realize we have little time to effect the change of the poll. So spread this around on other forums and people on 07scape already And also RS MEMBERS in general.

After you vote, go on the bottom of the main homepage and click the flag and switch to another flag and log in on the fourms. Then click the big vote button and it will count your vote again! Use common sense and also google translate if you are using google chrome.

Thx. Kept short for convienace.</description>

              <p>Ok, first off they wont be doing the “shitty” voice editing and stuff like that. These are minimul updates, even at the 750k mark they will only implement small things. The whole point of 2007 scape is to get rid of their “shitty” updates and go back to a time when RS was good for its vets. If anything they can leach the projects they have already worked on. I personally can leech it for them perfesionally so don’t act like they have immense ammount of workforce even to implement the 2007 servers in the first place. There is alot of things to pay for but after the big exspenses it CANNOT be more then 1M.<br>
BTW There is a FAQ about the poll being a sham; Jagex has been saying that the 750k option is viable, and can be done with the ammount of members. Considering legislation under “Good Faith in Buisness”; you can pretty much bank on that being a fact. Even to this day, in my opionion, the ammount of people signing up for 2007 scape surpasses the exspectations for over 1m members.</p>

<p>Because game severs don’t cost money, right?  Because there’s no such thing as paying staff and paying for layers and lawsuits right?  Nooo, that would be absurd.</p>
<p>OT:  If you feed them false information, they’ll do things that will basically ruin this too.  500k votes but only 200k players aren’t good statistics to them, and tells them they’re doing something wrong.  Dipshits<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Hey “Dipshit” JaGeX make tons of money, they have other games aswell. Not just RuneScape and they have the SOF and RuneCoins which probably increases there income by 20-25% Which pays for the workers them self. That’s not counting Membership people pay per month and shit like that.[/quote]<br>
They also develop other games witch end up as failures.  Read the employee reviews from that other thread.<br>
I’m not saying they can’t afford to do this, but I’m also saying they’ve proven to be money grubbing time and time again.  There are many things you have to factor in here people.  They’re also probably going to advertise this, pay their staff, pay for their servers, pay for their webservers, fund other projects that will likely fail, fund the actual development of the normal game (the shitty voice acting, etc, unless it’s part of the dev team), hire new people and go though the process of training them, and the list can go on but I’m busy training right now so I won’t continue.</p>
<p>Even if they’re making money hand over fist with it, this doesn’t mean that false statistics won’t throw a red flag to them.  An example being that if you started a pking clan and planned a trip for the weekend.  1000 people say they’ll come, but only 200 show up.  It’s still allot, but what weant wrong?  Was it something you did?  Were they just being nice?  It raises quite a few questions and can make you question your methods, even if that’s not the issue.</p>
<p>[quote=“imhero, post:13, topic:495572”]Whats changed other then the ammount of subscribers, considering the poll goes up to 750,000 people would suggest the ammount of members are ATLEAST over 1million. Also, they are only getting more with SOF and RuneCoins.</p>
<p>Hey guys im more then willing to debate about this if you make a post, but lets keep this out of this thread.[/quote]<br>
The only reason they put it up that high is so people would actually vote.  They fool you into thinking that they got 1.4 million member votes for the free trade/wildy update, but that was from the total rs population, not just members.  This is why it’s also a cash grab, people are much more likely to resubscribe to vote if they think for sure they can hit the mark.  Now we’re sitting at what is it, 400k votes, and that’s with the language changing, horrible spamming and ebegging, and pretty much everyone who actually wants it.  Plus now you’re also buying into the whole “jagex propaganda” by believing that there are over a million members based only off what they’re telling you.</p>

<p>Because game severs don’t cost money, right?  Because there’s no such thing as paying staff and paying for layers and lawsuits right?  Nooo, that would be absurd.</p>
<p>OT:  If you feed them false information, they’ll do things that will basically ruin this too.  500k votes but only 200k players aren’t good statistics to them, and tells them they’re doing something wrong.  Dipshits</p>

              <p>Hello, You may realize we have little time to effect the change of the poll. So spread this around on other forums and people on 07scape already And also RS MEMBERS in general.</p>
<p>After you vote, go on the bottom of the main homepage and click the flag and switch to another flag and log in on the fourms. Then click the big vote button and it will count your vote again! Use common sense and also google translate if you are using google chrome.</p>
<p>Thx. Kept short for convienace.</p>
