    <title>Unofficial Help Thread</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unofficial-help-thread/98239</link>
    <description>Hi, and welcome to the Un-official help thread. Here your questions should be answered by my self or other players. Please red the MoparScape rules before posting on this thread! The rules from MoparScape are the rules I&#39;d like you to follow here. SO post away if you&#39;ve got a problem! =D

Here are the rules -
Rule 1:
We are not anti-leech. If you respect our community and our ideas, feel free to ask questions and they will be kindly answered if you follow other rules. Answer to questions that others ask if you know the answer or remain silent!

Rule 2:
We don&#39;t talk about things we don&#39;t know. This is an informative, not a misinformative community.

Rule 3:
We don&#39;t make spelling mistakes on purpose. We use &quot;you&quot; not &quot;u&quot;, we use &quot;why&quot; not &quot;y&quot; etc.

Rule 4:
We don&#39;t make posts that contain not useful information. Posts like &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;lol&quot;, &quot;yeah&quot; and &quot;I agree&quot; don&#39;t contain anything useful for others. We are not fans of off topic, unless it contains something smart or funny. Most of things spammers find funny are actually not funny at all.

Rule 5:
We don&#39;t &quot;bump&quot; or double post.  If you want to add something to a post, edit your existing post

Rule 6:
We respect each other and other communities. We don&#39;t flame each other or other communities. We don&#39;t fight on the forums.

Rule 7:
We don&#39;t advertise other sites or communities unless we ask and receive permission to and from Moparisthebest. We don&#39;t post links to sites that are not in safe sites list on Moparisthebest.com main page. We never advertise via the PM system.

Rule 8:
We don&#39;t care about post count alone. If someone has high post count and most of it is spam, we hate him. If someone has high post count with informative posts, we love him. The higher count, the more we hate/love him.

Rule 9:
We never ask for &quot;rep&quot;.

Rule 10:
DO NOT post or upload any copyrighted materials, ie deobs, clients or any other sort (however if you were to link to a file that was uploaded somewhere else or post code in the pasteBin, well, I would have no control over that right? Wink )

Rule 11:
We do not sell anything on these forums with the exception of SCAR scripts.

Rule 12:
We never have misleading links in our signatures or posts.  If your signature or posts says www.google.com, we expect it to take us to google.com.

Rule 13:
Nothing to do with private servers belongs on moparisthebest.com, use moparisthebest.com/smf for these things.

Rule 14:
We only have 1 Forum account for Moparisthebest.com and Moparscape.org.  If you get banned or have trouble logging in, email an admin, or get a friend to contact an admin.  Multiple accounts will result in Bans.

Rule 15:
Do not talk about the Answers to the Quiz.  The purpose of it is to force new users to search for answers, and if it is discussed, searching the for answers will become very easy

Rule 16:
Do not share forum accounts on either Moparisthebest.com or Moparscape.org.  If we find out that you are sharing forum accounts with a family member of friend, you will be banned.  If you want to access the forums, please create your own account.</description>

Is there a way around the password? And most of the files I can not open without a certain program(theres at least 50) and they all take separate programs, is there a way I can get through that with out downloading 50 different programs?</p>

<p>Hi, you can’t connect to servers for the reason is the server is down. Just keep on clicking log in and you should get in. Also try different servers, don’t just stick with one. I hope that helps! =D<br>

<p>It has heppened to me, trust me sometimes you just can’t connect. And you haven’t tryed EVERY server right? Try all of them but don’t give up, if you just click log in once and the server says it’s down just keep on trying.</p>

<p>Hi, you can’t connect to servers for the reason is the server is down. Just keep on clicking log in and you should get in. Also try different servers, don’t just stick with one. I hope that helps! =D</p>

              <p>Hi, and welcome to the Un-official help thread. Here your questions should be answered by my self or other players. Please red the MoparScape rules before posting on this thread! The rules from MoparScape are the rules I’d like you to follow here. SO post away if you’ve got a problem! =D</p>
<p>Here are the rules -<br>
Rule 1:<br>
We are not anti-leech. If you respect our community and our ideas, feel free to ask questions and they will be kindly answered if you follow other rules. Answer to questions that others ask if you know the answer or remain silent!</p>
<p>Rule 2:<br>
We don’t talk about things we don’t know. This is an informative, not a misinformative community.</p>
<p>Rule 3:<br>
We don’t make spelling mistakes on purpose. We use “you” not “u”, we use “why” not “y” etc.</p>
<p>Rule 4:<br>
We don’t make posts that contain not useful information. Posts like “cool”, “lol”, “yeah” and “I agree” don’t contain anything useful for others. We are not fans of off topic, unless it contains something smart or funny. Most of things spammers find funny are actually not funny at all.</p>
<p>Rule 5:<br>
We don’t “bump” or double post.  If you want to add something to a post, edit your existing post</p>
<p>Rule 6:<br>
We respect each other and other communities. We don’t flame each other or other communities. We don’t fight on the forums.</p>
<p>Rule 7:<br>
We don’t advertise other sites or communities unless we ask and receive permission to and from Moparisthebest. We don’t post links to sites that are not in safe sites list on <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> main page. We never advertise via the PM system.</p>
<p>Rule 8:<br>
We don’t care about post count alone. If someone has high post count and most of it is spam, we hate him. If someone has high post count with informative posts, we love him. The higher count, the more we hate/love him.</p>
<p>Rule 9:<br>
We never ask for “rep”.</p>
<p>Rule 10:<br>
DO NOT post or upload any copyrighted materials, ie deobs, clients or any other sort (however if you were to link to a file that was uploaded somewhere else or post code in the pasteBin, well, I would have no control over that right? Wink )</p>
<p>Rule 11:<br>
We do not sell anything on these forums with the exception of SCAR scripts.</p>
<p>Rule 12:<br>
We never have misleading links in our signatures or posts.  If your signature or posts says <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a>, we expect it to take us to <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>.</p>
<p>Rule 13:<br>
Nothing to do with private servers belongs on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, use <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> for these things.</p>
<p>Rule 14:<br>
We only have 1 Forum account for <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> and <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a>.  If you get banned or have trouble logging in, email an admin, or get a friend to contact an admin.  Multiple accounts will result in Bans.</p>
<p>Rule 15:<br>
Do not talk about the Answers to the Quiz.  The purpose of it is to force new users to search for answers, and if it is discussed, searching the for answers will become very easy</p>
<p>Rule 16:<br>
Do not share forum accounts on either <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> or <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a>.  If we find out that you are sharing forum accounts with a family member of friend, you will be banned.  If you want to access the forums, please create your own account.</p>
