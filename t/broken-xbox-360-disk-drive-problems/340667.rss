    <description>Question: Has your xbox ever had the &quot;Unreadable Disk Error&quot;?


Have you tried to fix it yourself?


What was wrong with it?


How did you fix it?


I&#39;m currently fixing mine, see Microsoft charges 100 bucks and 2 weeks to fix your xbox, yet i can fix mine for 8 dollars and in 30 minutes. I just needed a new motor (motor moves your laser up and down)</description>

From what i’ve read you just need to replace some screws for the CPU heatsink (might have bean GPU?)[/quote]That fix works by flexing the motherboard and making cracked solder balls reconnect.  However, this additional pressure on the motherboard will cause more solder to crack and has even recorded braking traces.</p>
<p>This solution is temporary and will not last.</p>

<p>Is it hard to fix RROD, I haven’t looked into it, my friend wants me to fix his.[/quote]As long as no one has done anything stupid like the towel trick, penny trick, x-clamp fix, eraser mod etc, then it should be easily fixable.  But you will need the proper equipment.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reworking station</li>
<li>A preheater for your board (if the station doesn’t have one).</li>
<li>40x40mm and 20x20 mm nozzles</li>
<li>Some new thermal paste (preferably Artic Silver 5)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, you will need the following tools:</p>
<p>Torx 10, Torx 8, an xbox opening kit (optional, but helps a lot.  you can just cut apart a dvd spindle lid), and a small flat head screw driver for removing the x-clamps.</p>
<p>The xbox uses lead free solder which liquidates at 217C and it is recommended to reach a temperature of 230C for atleast 25 seconds but no more than 90 seconds.  Note that this temperature should be BETWEEN the chip and the motherboard, not above or below it.</p>
<p>Keep the board suspended 1-1.5 inches from the preheater, which should be outputting 400F</p>

The warranty was gone because my friend was an idiot.</p>
<p>I just took off the GPU, reballed it, didn’t help, reflowed the HANA chip and boom.  Problem solved.<br>

<p>Is it hard to fix RROD, I haven’t looked into it, my friend wants me to fix his.[/quote]<br>
From what i’ve read you just need to replace some screws for the CPU heatsink (might have bean GPU?)</p>

<p>How did you fix it?</p>
<p>I’m currently fixing mine, see Microsoft charges 100 bucks and 2 weeks to fix your xbox, yet i can fix mine for 8 dollars and in 30 minutes. I just needed a new motor (motor moves your laser up and down)</p>
