    <title>Few questions. Help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-questions-help-please/189032</link>
    <description>I got a few quick questions few about client and few about server.

Client:

When its loading can you have it say &quot;Loading please wait...&quot; in the loading bar the whole time till its done?

Can you change the colour of the loading bar?

When I run the client at the top wimdow it says the persons name who created it how can I change this because im editing the client. I checked client but its not there.

How can I tell if the client has the bando&#39;s/ other new NPC&#39;s

Server

is there a way to change the ::pickup that you don&#39;t need to do ::pickup 00995 and just 0995 and still be able to code Jagex items?

Thankyou if you can answer any one thats great thanks and if you can&#39;t thanks for trying :)</description>
