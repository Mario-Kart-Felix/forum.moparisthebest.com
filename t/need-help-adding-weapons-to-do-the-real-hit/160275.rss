    <title>Need help adding weapons to do the real hit</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-adding-weapons-to-do-the-real-hit/160275</link>
    <description>ok i need help adding weapons to do the actual hit, i am using devolution.
all weapons, except bows, will just hit real fast and you practically can&#39;t see anything.
I want the weapons to do the real hit&#39;s like d2h spin hit, rune skimmy slice like, rune longsword the chop looking attack. *note that was examples of attack style things, that the weapons automatically do.*

also i don&#39;t have this part either

f(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1333
{
return 406;
}

if someone could help me add them or get me a guide i would most appriciate it.
and i will R3P++</description>
