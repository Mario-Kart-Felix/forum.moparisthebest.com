    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-trolling-us/374439</link>
    <description>Did some snooping around, a lot of people seem to think this &quot;Bring back the wilderness &amp; Free trade!&quot; Is a sham. I am starting to think so aswell, it&#39;s fishy that you can vote more then one time with the same or a different account, you can put in &quot;Zezima&quot; and it&#39;d work, or &quot;Mod Mmg&quot;. A lot of rumors are they are going for another world record, which one? I am unsure. They&#39;ve won several in the past and they even mention it in the post &lt;blockquote&gt;The Jagex family has grown to well over 400, we’ve picked up a number of Guinness World Records along the way (and counting), and for the second year running we’ve won the Golden Joystick Awards as best UK developer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seems to me they said &quot;and counting&quot; is this another world record of some sort? They&#39;ve fucked with us so much in the past I am starting to think they are just fucking us over, if they aren&#39;t they still are trolling us. With their release of StelarDawn coming out within a year they may be trying to keep their nasty addicted players to RuneScape and make a whole new community on StellarDawn.


Here is 1 video that really convinced me, I&#39;m sure there are more out there. Just look for yourself.

<p>They dont give an exact amount.</p>
<p>If they are trolling, they will lose a massive player base, again.</p>

Explain how it would decrease their playerbase? Alot of players left after this shitty update in '07…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>if they work up the commotion and get so many votes etc and then decide not to re-instate wildy and free trade, they will lose more players.[/quote]<br>
They would have to be complete retards not to do this, with all this built up. Wait a minute…<br>
But just think almost 4 years ago, jagex destroyed their golden age, right now, their company is on the line, they dont reinstate it, or lie, MMG can kiss his money jacuzzi good bye</p>

              <p>If u go on the Guiness book of world records website it even says that Jagex is trying to break the record for most votes on an update in a short amount of time or something like that, they are trying to go for the record, but i doubt they would say they are going to bring back the wild and free trade just to get votes, and not actually bring it back…</p>

Perhaps not even 1,000,000, we got over 1 million votes on the first day.
<p>No mater what they are trying to do, I guess we’ll find out January 14.</p>

              <p>When I first got membership it was $5 a month, then after time I ended my membership, when I went back it was $7 a month, that was after FunOrb, cause it was joint membership, now it’s $5 a month for RuneScape or $7 a month for both Runescape and FunOrb.</p>
<p>The way I am looking at it now is, they get paid like… 2 cents per page view, and they are shooting for 1 million views, plus this is going to bring back more members plus people are going to make multiple accounts members to transfer over items. So overall they are going to make a nice Christmas bonus out of this. I see them making at least 1-3 million USD if they go through with this, not to mention if this is a Guinness World Record, they will get free advertisement causing more people to play their game. No matter what happens this is getting them players.</p>

</aside>
<p>not really, the price of membership by phone has dropped from $10 to $7.<br>
although that isnt the overall price of membership, which has only risen by like $1 over a year maybe? not that bad.</p>
