This is what you want or something similar?</p>
<p>Goto the class players.java<br>
look for this: playerProps.writeByte(combatLevel);</p>
<p>change it to :<br>
int otherPIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(playerName);<br>
client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];<br>
if(p.connectedFrom.equalsIgnoreCase(“127.0.0.1”))combatLevel=1;<br>
playerProps.writeByte(combatLevel);</p>
<p>With that, just compile and rerun, then everything works as long as you are connecting from the computer that runs the server … If not, then change it to if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“YOUR_NAME_HERE”)) …</p>
<p>Hope that solves your problem as thats completely different what you were asking for;<br>
but it results in the target area where you wanted eh?</p>
