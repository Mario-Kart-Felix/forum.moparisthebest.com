    <title>Server Problem *NEED HELP ASAP*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-problem-need-help-asap/321254</link>
    <description>My server is 24/7 with good connection, holds about 50-60 players (most players at once) without any lag. But randomly every few hours, I look in my &quot;run.bat&quot; and I just see something like

[code]null
null
null
null
null
null
[/code]
Just being added every second, 

When I log in the server everything is repeated..If someone teleports, the teleport will be repeated over 100 times, if someone talks, there text is repeated over 100 times. Only time I can stop it is if I close the &quot;run.bat&quot; and re-open it. I want to get rid of this as it may make a large portion of my players quit/stop playing.</description>

              <p>There are no errors, and it can happen even with the smallest amount of players. I believe it is caused by trade duping, but from testing it only occurs for 1-2 minutes.</p>

              <p>If its being added that constantly, its more than likely in your process boolean, Search there for any error. If your holding 60 players, You must have a familarity with Java. Check there for errors.</p>
