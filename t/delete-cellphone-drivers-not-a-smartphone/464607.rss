    <title>Delete cellphone drivers (NOT A SMARTPHONE)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delete-cellphone-drivers-not-a-smartphone/464607</link>
    <description>I need some help I have a Samsung rogue (SCH-u960) and I want to wipe out the drivers on it, so far I have been not successful, partly because only windows will recognize the drivers, when it does it won&#39;t allow me to do anything which I think is the point. I&#39;m willing to do anything so even physically ripping information off is on the table.</description>
