    <title>World war 3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/world-war-3/152626</link>
    <description>I just read a book that has solid proof that George bush set up the 9/11 attack and framed Iraq so he had an excuse to invade them while you all thought he was there to get Saddam to give you more oil or to kill him he was actually there to take over his oil operation as 90% of the worlds oil is in the Middle-East, He wants to take their oil because, The world revolves around oil, If you have the oil, The world is yours (kinda). Which in turn caused them to invade the other countries around Russia hoping for even more oil such as Pakistan or Iran and is even starting on Turkey etc, Thanks to George bush Iraq etc has been ripped apart.. The Russian president doesn&#39;t like how America is treading on his turf and is getting very angry, And he might attack if they continue in this manner Which might start world war 3? Because if Russia attacks America then other countries that hate America will join in, but also an equal (maybe) amount will defend it causing World war 3.</description>
