    <title>World War 3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/world-war-3/7207</link>
    <description>First off let me make my point clear, 

My opinion is that World War is on a imminent path of destruction.
The Cause? Started by a foolish battle between Moors and Jews.
Will it end? It won&#39;t (hopefully) end until someone moves either one of the damn religions to a white zone, or set up Tactical Forced near the border.
The Ongoing factor? George &quot;Wiener&quot; Bush.
Weapon? No longer are we accustomed to fighting the traditional war with Rifles or Muskets, Our wars are now fought on Computer Aided Warfront TEchnology issuing positions, targets and we call the General to push the tiny button called &quot; Fire Laser Assisted Nuclear Warhead&quot;
End Result? Either parts of Palestine or Iraq annihilated while the passing Japs from Hiroshima say &quot;Did we no tell you! They from over water! They evil&quot;

I believe this confilict could be contained if the Americans stop sticking their Fat asses in every affair going on in the world. It happened in World War I, II, Vietnam and Now. If American truly wants to maintain peace it would do good to concentrate its energy on its already rotting infrastructure. The AMerican&#39;s nosy attitude is well depicted in the movie &quot;Team America: World Police&quot; We have already overriden the UN&#39;s control over us, now we have to go and be &quot;Good Samaritans&quot; between warring nations, one consisting of Turban Adorned Extremists and the other, tormented by everyone for the past 2000 years. If this situation is to get better Bush should stop using the Useless Tactic which he explained as &quot; As the war advances we believe the resulting product will be extermination of all terrorism in that region -.-&quot; , The wisest thing to do at the moment is to slowly retreat and stop wasting lived on a pathetic battle which we have no business being in except for oil, which we have adequate amounts of in Alaska.

Discuss, Please talk appropriately, No Flaming or religions, people etc.

Simply put, we shouldn’t, yet there is certainly more sympathy for Israel than Islam here in the U.S. I suppose that it’s because the media’s portrayal of the Jews as “the victimized good guys that are in their rightful land”, and Muslims as “crazed extremist bastards with no sense of humanity”. In truth, the Jews only have historical claims to the Holy Land, and the Qu’ran denounces violence, the extremists are just psychos who believe it is their destiny to kill random innocent civilians. (correct me if I’m wrong, my teacher was the one who taught us about the Qu’ran)</p>

<p>And hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, but it doesnâ€™t exist in the form we can use it in on Earth. It takes electrolysis to break apart water molecules which uses a very large amount of electrical current. Doesnâ€™t make a whole lot of sense to do that does it? There are a few other methods but they all need large amounts of energy. Of course, itâ€™s still better then Fossil Fuels.</p>
<p>Arenâ€™t there supposed to be hydrogen fuel stations in Vancouver B.C. by the next winter Olympics? Or was it just that they were funding hydrogen products?</p>
<p>As for wars go, humans are stupid. We charge into war without really thinking about the consequences, and kill other people for absolutely no valid reason. Everything that is going on now could have been prevented and we could still prevent anything from getting worse. But it is most likely that nothing (or very little) will happen to change anything.</p>
<p>Few people try to change something they know is wrong until it begins to directly affect their way of life. Which doesnâ€™t make sense because it is already affecting them in some way.</p>

welcome to big corn.  amazing the farm lobby.. corn is not the best.
<blockquote>Suppresion of other technologies.</blockquote>
people dont want new power plants in their backyard.  Enviornemntla laws dont allow upgrading old plants wihtout making the entire plant ok with new stricter laws.

<p>Gokon: Corn is renewable and Hydrogen isn’t? I think you need to go to Chemistry 101. Hydrogen is a gas, like Oxygen, Nitrogen, Helium.

<p>PaulT: The benefit of allying could be for future purposes or perhaps getting a little friendly to get some Oil.</p>

              <p>i think hydrogen cars are more likely to happen becuse burning Hydrogen and O2 makes water and more hydrogen while burning corn oil is bound to leave a residue of some sort… and it might even stop the drought warnings…</p>
<p>im not to hot on the subject of the troops in Iraq but havent some countrys said they already have pulled theirs out? so if our UK army was to come out it could force the US to take its out</p>
<p>and i dont think its ever going to come to a nuclear war for 2 reasons</p>
<p>1- IF a nuclear war started and it was between the middle east or wherever places like Iraq is then they could risk blowing up oil fields that are viatal to the US and they would possably be stoped by the big oil companys like Shell and BP who could exsert lots of pressure on any country</p>
<p>2- many other conntrys have nuclear wepons now so if someone shoots a nuke unless he can hit every country and totaly decimate it then their going to be fired apon, if you know that another country has enough nukes to take out (uk cuse i dont know any other places) London. Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham, Chelsy thats 5 citys and london includes the parliment and such so can a country fire nuclior wepons at another and just throw away itself?</p>
<p>3- after point 2 that leaves ownly conventional forces and as you have recently seen in Irak with the suiside bombings kiling pepol and Hezbolh(whatever) then even the best armys in the world can run into problems with gurrilia warfare</p>

<p>Yeah, see the difference between the terrorism that Iran and Pakistan take part in and the terrorism that Isreal takes part in, is that we support Isreal’s terrorist actions, monetarily and diplomatically.  We don’t get any benifit from allying with Isreal, or with any middle eastern nation.</p>
