[FONT=Arial Narrow]Welcome to Verinia (II), we are a RuneScape Private Server (build 498) which launched at January 09, 2015. With the aim to recreate RuneScape as it was back in 2008. 
We have already finished all skills 100%, we are constantly bringing more content for our community to enjoy. If you have any queries or suggestions please let us know on the forums.[/FONT]

[spoiler=&quot;World 1&quot;][IMG]http://verinia.com/verinia.jpg[/img][/spoiler]
[spoiler=&quot;World 2&quot;]Please note, we are not the same as the other Verinia server, yes this is just another world but its another game altogether. Its more appropriate for players who are just looking to get on and have some fun and not grind at experience.

[SIZE=5]PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU SELECT WORLD 2!
