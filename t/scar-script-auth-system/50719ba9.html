5-- neonkngiht didnt deserve to be banned. sure he pissed you off alot but thats all he did. you banned him everywhere before the srl incident that turned him sour impsoft was his only home so he decided to release the stuff he got in your community you then removed it there wasnt any proff as i said before thats why on impsoft when i made your mod then later admin i said to not delete topics but to move them to the admiun section or the recylebin not the public one the other one then only the mod+ can see if and things can be dealt with.<br>
" i dont have to. No where did you state that i couldn’t modify it or that i ahve to send it back to the creator." that is a horrible thing. especially cause we were keeping it private.</p>
<p>8-- so you listen to the mods and admins here but not when you were a mod+ at our site why such disrespect.</p>
<p>star its soo unnerving how much of a hypocritic and politician you are. we tried to be true and help you so we could be helped back but you are a twofaced</p>

        <p>[quote=“ruler, post:40, topic:5071”]Star you were happy with the suth system and the obfuscation system.  Infact if i remeber correctly both you and neon wokred on making your script work with it.  You were very ahppy with the system.  I don’t know who added thse features to the obfuscator but i imagein is around the lines, re-inert string back into script, and for the string<br>
newstring="";<br>
for(int i=0;i&lt;string.length();i++){<br>
newstring=“char(”+((int)string.substring(i,i+1))+")";<br>
}</p>
<p>Thier is no doubt i spent alot of time contributing for your benifit.  I understand thier are no string attached.  Correct you don’t have to send me any improvements.  And after your recent comment i dont expect any.  Their was none when i got it form mopar yet i still sent him updates out of respect.</p>
<p>I know mopar didn’t want my aryan scripts removed from this site because he wanted to attract alot of leechers.  He has never respected any of my work.  Same with you now… He made aryan as leech friendly as possible and encouraged script packs.  Yet when the very idea of a srl script pack is mention you all go crazy with threats.  I understand you standing up for us would have affect your position.</p>
<p>You need to be refreshed on our chat logs.  The recent logs involves you asking for mod, or the new auth system or who neonknights source is.<br>
The previous logs before 11/0/05-3/0/06 involve asking question about auth system, script encryption.,scar shell,ect.</p>
<p>You said you were going to be active with ubi because ti was scar, you said you were not active with aryan bc before we were java based.</p>
<p>You tried to bait me to give up neonknights source, talking about a secret project, ect.</p>
<p>I am just tired of all the bullshit, lack of evidence, broken word.  You talk to people in private ims and reveal to others thing that were between two people.  I wouldn’t trust you with any secrets not after how fast things i told you spread.  Oh i tell you i got a copy of the svn, bam i get pmes from Fawki, amazing…  Keep in mind this is 3 weeks after you all banned neonknight fomr multiple sites.  What else is he going to do?  He entrusted me with the stuff and left the scene.  I still have it and i havn’t release it.  Genodemon dosn’t even have it.  I don’t even rememrb fi i told genodemon i got a copy.  You think i will trust you with info?, never.</p>
<p>I dont think you lied to me during the neon,you,fawki incient.  but i do know know both fawki and neon lied to me.</p>
<p>don’t worry about this, i forgive easily.  I don’t hold grudges.  but I don’t like people saying shit about my behind my back.  Atleast the aryan devs fessed up to what they have done.  They and i have nothing to hide.  We are both truthful and open about our actions.  Actaully i tihnk me and them both had fun.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yea i was happy with the auth system and obfus.  I’ve moved on.<br>
I did respect your work and you.  Ive moved on<br>
I asked why was i demodded and if i can be remodded i agree.  You sent me the examples of the auth systems and i asked about them.  You said you knew who Neons source was and i asked for them.  Basically you baited me and then waited for me to fall into a trap so you could use it against me.<br>
I still have a secret Project.  Although you dont have to know about that.  Everyone who i want to know about it already does.<br>
You will hold a grudge against me for this, no one is that stupid not to.  I’ve never said shit about you behind your back.  Other yes, but not you.  I HAD  lot of respect for you.<br>
And what do you want me to confess to?  I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong.  Dont tell me banning Neon on other communities was wrong because you have asked me to do similar for your site.  Dont tell me i banned him because i disliked him, thats also a lie.  I did like him a lot but the truth is a lot more important to me than a cyber friend.</p>
<p>Geno -<br>
4) I dont know.<br>
5) I just wanted to get them off of your site.  And in know that all attached files are stored on the server anyway so check them.  If they were just posted as text, im sorry but i know i did the right thing.<br>
You still didn’t tell me<br>
8) I did listen to you guys, i just wasn’t very active there</p>
<p>Dont say i hate you guys or anything because i didn’t.  Ive only started because you started atacking me for doing the right thing and im fighting back.  I had a lot of respect for you both, you were very succesful and many people were jealous of you.  All i ever wanted to do was help you with your success but you’ve completely turned against me for doing so.  Did i ask in anything in return from all the money you were making? no. none at all.  My views on you have completely changed</p>
