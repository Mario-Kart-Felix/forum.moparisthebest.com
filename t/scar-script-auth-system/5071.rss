    <title>SCAR script auth system?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scar-script-auth-system/5071</link>
    <description>hello all

i have finally perfected my private script, and are almost ready to sell it, although i dont want it to be leaked around this and other communities, so i was wondering how would i go about setting up an auth system? could somebody post some instructions or a place that it could be hosted.

thanks in advance, frosty</description>

Infact if i remeber correctly both you and neon wokred on making your script work with it.  You were very ahppy with the system.

}</p>
<p>Thier is no doubt i spent alot of time contributing for your benifit.  I understand thier are no string attached.  Correct you don’t have to send me any improvements.  And after your recent comment i dont expect any.  Their was none when i got it form mopar yet i still sent him updates out of respect.</p>
<p>I know mopar didn’t want my aryan scripts removed from this site because he wanted to attract alot of leechers.  He has never respected any of my work.  Same with you now… He made aryan as leech friendly as possible and encouraged script packs.  Yet when the very idea of a srl script pack is mention you all go crazy with threats.  I understand you standing up for us would have affect your position.</p>
<p>You need to be refreshed on our chat logs.  The recent logs involves you asking for mod, or the new auth system or who neonknights source is.<br>
The previous logs before 11/0/05-3/0/06 involve asking question about auth system, script encryption.,scar shell,ect.</p>
<p>You said you were going to be active with ubi because ti was scar, you said you were not active with aryan bc before we were java based.</p>
<p>You tried to bait me to give up neonknights source, talking about a secret project, ect.</p>
<p>I am just tired of all the bullshit, lack of evidence, broken word.  You talk to people in private ims and reveal to others thing that were between two people.  I wouldn’t trust you with any secrets not after how fast things i told you spread.  Oh i tell you i got a copy of the svn, bam i get pmes from Fawki, amazing…  Keep in mind this is 3 weeks after you all banned neonknight fomr multiple sites.  What else is he going to do?  He entrusted me with the stuff and left the scene.  I still have it and i havn’t release it.  Genodemon dosn’t even have it.  I don’t even rememrb fi i told genodemon i got a copy.  You think i will trust you with info?, never.</p>
<p>I dont think you lied to me during the neon,you,fawki incient.  but i do know know both fawki and neon lied to me.</p>
<p>don’t worry about this, i forgive easily.  I don’t hold grudges.  but I don’t like people saying shit about my behind my back.  Atleast the aryan devs fessed up to what they have done.  They and i have nothing to hide.  We are both truthful and open about our actions.  Actaully i tihnk me and them both had fun.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yea i was happy with the auth system and obfus.  I’ve moved on.<br>
I did respect your work and you.  Ive moved on<br>
I asked why was i demodded and if i can be remodded i agree.  You sent me the examples of the auth systems and i asked about them.  You said you knew who Neons source was and i asked for them.  Basically you baited me and then waited for me to fall into a trap so you could use it against me.<br>
I still have a secret Project.  Although you dont have to know about that.  Everyone who i want to know about it already does.<br>
You will hold a grudge against me for this, no one is that stupid not to.  I’ve never said shit about you behind your back.  Other yes, but not you.  I HAD  lot of respect for you.<br>
And what do you want me to confess to?  I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong.  Dont tell me banning Neon on other communities was wrong because you have asked me to do similar for your site.  Dont tell me i banned him because i disliked him, thats also a lie.  I did like him a lot but the truth is a lot more important to me than a cyber friend.</p>
<p>Geno -<br>
4) I dont know.<br>
5) I just wanted to get them off of your site.  And in know that all attached files are stored on the server anyway so check them.  If they were just posted as text, im sorry but i know i did the right thing.<br>
You still didn’t tell me<br>
8) I did listen to you guys, i just wasn’t very active there</p>
<p>Dont say i hate you guys or anything because i didn’t.  Ive only started because you started atacking me for doing the right thing and im fighting back.  I had a lot of respect for you both, you were very succesful and many people were jealous of you.  All i ever wanted to do was help you with your success but you’ve completely turned against me for doing so.  Did i ask in anything in return from all the money you were making? no. none at all.  My views on you have completely changed</p>

5-- neonkngiht didnt deserve to be banned. sure he pissed you off alot but thats all he did. you banned him everywhere before the srl incident that turned him sour impsoft was his only home so he decided to release the stuff he got in your community you then removed it there wasnt any proff as i said before thats why on impsoft when i made your mod then later admin i said to not delete topics but to move them to the admiun section or the recylebin not the public one the other one then only the mod+ can see if and things can be dealt with.<br>
" i dont have to. No where did you state that i couldn’t modify it or that i ahve to send it back to the creator." that is a horrible thing. especially cause we were keeping it private.</p>
<p>8-- so you listen to the mods and admins here but not when you were a mod+ at our site why such disrespect.</p>
<p>star its soo unnerving how much of a hypocritic and politician you are. we tried to be true and help you so we could be helped back but you are a twofaced</p>

              <p>[quote=“GenoDemoN, post:33, topic:5071”]I have only to talk to star here with the truth. i dont understand how all of a sudden this is between us and regex etc. go get your own topic.</p>
<p>First put “your rep on the line”? i never saw that anywhere posted at all. and all of the activities that you do are hidden from public as you act in only the “private” boards of sites the public doesnt know anything that you do except for your precious stressminer. we know some of the actions that you do from looking at the admin/mod logs at our old site, and that must be only the tip of the iceberg. we post to the public everything we do and because of that we get the shit that comes with it but thats because we stand behind our decisions with facts not acting in the shawdows. you exercise your power without any public insight or knowledege.</p>
<p>why tell us about this “hidden” community on kait that we arent a part of. you obviously want to belittle us, not a good thing to do to someone who was on you side from day 1.</p>
<p>Star frankly your a forum mod/admin groupie.</p>
<p>I see now your a mopar admin now that srl is “moving” here lol. i talked to some of the devs about this “unanmous descision” and it wasnt that from what the ones i talked to have said.</p>
<p>Star you have only caused use problems. we let you be a mod in the beginning cause you were a mod everywhere else. you deleted topics and banned people without telling us anything you were never online to talk to us unless you needed soemthing from us. You also have deleted and banned people on our site for other admins and never told us or put anything in the ban messages. The deleteing topics was a bad move cause then we had no proof that neonkngiht for example actually posted any srl dev things. neonkngiht then told us everything he posted and that didnt match up to your claims. You took the liberty to excerise banning neonkngiht in every forum you had power in even ours when you were a admin. how many others have suffereed from you?</p>
<p>We provided a free service of obfusticator and auth system and you claim you added features to the obfusticator and never shower or gave it to the creator(eric). we gave mopar the newest features &amp; updated verision before we even used it, he only did 10 lines of it. mopar was giving it before it was public at all even weeks before. eric added about 500 lines to it why dont you give the newest to eric?</p>
<p>You star only serve yourself and not others.</p>
<p>edit: you talk bout how you removed our stuff from other forums? this forum here never removed one of our aryan scripts and however after this site was ddosed by nerice for cracking and psoting slavebot slavebot release were finally removed but also were our topics. the scripts were never removed.[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>As always i ban people who i think deserve banning and i remove topics that shouldn’t be there.  If i told eveyone everything i do i would be here forever.</li>
<li>It came up in conversation.  Sorry if you weren’t part of it but then again only about 20 members out of the 32k were.  Stop crying over it</li>
<li>No, im trusted</li>
<li>Ive always been an admin here fight from the beginning.  Ask any member here.  How mnany devs have you talked to?  Because we had a vote, and the majority of devs wanted it moved here so thats what Mopar did.  I had nothing to do with that except the vote.</li>
<li>you deleted topics and banned people without telling us anything you were never online to talk - Again i ban people who i think deserve banning and i remove topics that shouldn’t be there, like i would do on any other forum.  And im very busy, and you live in Florida and me in England.  what do you expect?<br>
You also have deleted and banned people on our site for other admins and never told us or put anything in the ban messages - Im lazy like many others<br>
The deleteing topics was a bad move cause then we had no proof that neonkngiht for example actually posted any srl dev things -I cant believe your actually saying this.  Im not gonna wait for you to actually see that he posted shit and then remove private work.  Im gonna remove it straight away.  What kind of an idiot are you?<br>
how many others have suffereed from you? - None.  Idiot</li>
<li>i dont have to. No where did you state that i couldn’t modify it or that i ahve to send it back to the creator.</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>I was instructed not to.  Remember this is not my site.</li>
</ol>
<p>That must have taken you, what 20 minutes to write?  what a waste of time.</p>

              <p>I have only to talk to star here with the truth. i dont understand how all of a sudden this is between us and regex etc. go get your own topic.</p>
<p>First put “your rep on the line”? i never saw that anywhere posted at all. and all of the activities that you do are hidden from public as you act in only the “private” boards of sites the public doesnt know anything that you do except for your precious stressminer. we know some of the actions that you do from looking at the admin/mod logs at our old site, and that must be only the tip of the iceberg. we post to the public everything we do and because of that we get the shit that comes with it but thats because we stand behind our decisions with facts not acting in the shawdows. you exercise your power without any public insight or knowledege.</p>
<p>why tell us about this “hidden” community on kait that we arent a part of. you obviously want to belittle us, not a good thing to do to someone who was on you side from day 1.</p>
<p>Star frankly your a forum mod/admin groupie.</p>
<p>I see now your a mopar admin now that srl is “moving” here lol. i talked to some of the devs about this “unanmous descision” and it wasnt that from what the ones i talked to have said.</p>
<p>Star you have only caused use problems. we let you be a mod in the beginning cause you were a mod everywhere else. you deleted topics and banned people without telling us anything you were never online to talk to us unless you needed soemthing from us. You also have deleted and banned people on our site for other admins and never told us or put anything in the ban messages. The deleteing topics was a bad move cause then we had no proof that neonkngiht for example actually posted any srl dev things. neonkngiht then told us everything he posted and that didnt match up to your claims. You took the liberty to excerise banning neonkngiht in every forum you had power in even ours when you were a admin. how many others have suffereed from you?</p>
<p>We provided a free service of obfusticator and auth system and you claim you added features to the obfusticator and never shower or gave it to the creator(eric). we gave mopar the newest features &amp; updated verision before we even used it, he only did 10 lines of it. mopar was giving it before it was public at all even weeks before. eric added about 500 lines to it why dont you give the newest to eric?</p>
<p>You star only serve yourself and not others.</p>
<p>edit: you talk bout how you removed our stuff from other forums? this forum here never removed one of our aryan scripts and however after this site was ddosed by nerice for cracking and psoting slavebot slavebot release were finally removed but also were our topics. the scripts were never removed.</p>

<p>if your really wanted to get nerice back for releasing your stuff you should have let him join and root him with some code.  Your attacks only affected me and not him.  I enjoyed getting deobs form your refacotrer from him then posting them in irc convs with your team.  Also enjoyed saying i was going to buy your newer aryan. LOL at the same time knowing its true abilites from nerice.  However nerice never told me which dev gave him their svn user/pass but he did say Kamu was looking to be bought out for cash.  I dont think you all realize how “trusted” nerice was and his actions.
