    <description>Hey guys, uhm i was just wondering because for the few days that have gone by, i&#39;ve been giving my players a dl client and for some reason it hasn&#39;t been working :( So, i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m taking out the wrong stuff, leaving in the wrong things, or it&#39;s my players. I&#39;d greatly appreciate if you guys can tell me what to leave in and take out for my 667/711 rsps. Thanks! :D
If you guys know a good webclient maker, please refer me to one because i&#39;m really desperate for one.</description>
