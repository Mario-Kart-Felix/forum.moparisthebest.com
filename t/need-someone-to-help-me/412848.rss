    <description>Hi guys,
I&#39;m 14, I have played RS for years and I have been playing RSPS&#39;s for like 2 years now.
Around a week ago I decided to try to make my own server, it worked out even though I haven&#39;t put it online.
I would like to have someone learn me sone Java basics and how to move, place and edit things in my server.
After all, everyone that likes this stuff has to learn it some day. :)
You can add me on skype, my name is camiel.terraria (please don&#39;t judge me on the terraria thing xd).

- Bitterlemon

EDIT: 
Thanks a lot 
I&#39;m not actually trying to make something, I just need someone to help me with this kind of stuff 
Later on I can try to make like... a client, maybe. That&#39;s why I want to learn about this, coding/programming looks like a lot of fun to me.</description>
