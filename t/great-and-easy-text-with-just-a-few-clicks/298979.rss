    <title>Great and easy text with just a few clicks</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/great-and-easy-text-with-just-a-few-clicks/298979</link>
    <description>Well some people seem to input there text with the tool &quot;Create&quot;
But im here to say that theres a even easier way!

Very simple and very easy.

Open up metasequoia and then browse the tool bar across until you find &quot;Object&quot; click it and then click &quot;Create&quot; and then &quot;Create Text&quot;
A new box should open with a selection box and a type in box now the type in box is the bottom one that has nothing in it, thats where your text will go, and then selection box is just the type of font you use. Once done you click &quot;ok&quot; and hallelujah your text will appear

It should look something like this:

You can change the colour and you can resize it and everything else.
Just remember to make a new object and call it text</description>
