    <description>[center][size=24pt][b]Project oNe[/b][/size]

Hello everyone. This is my Project that I&#39;m doing. It&#39;s called &quot;Project oNe&quot;, because it is my first major project, in which I&#39;m going to spend a large amount of time developing before I release it. It&#39;s an AllStar-Scape v2 server base, and I&#39;m using the MoparScape WebClient. I&#39;ve got a load of work ahead of me, and I&#39;m going to use this post to help me keep track of what I need to do, and what I have left. I started this project about a week and a half ago, so I&#39;ve already got some of my agenda done.
