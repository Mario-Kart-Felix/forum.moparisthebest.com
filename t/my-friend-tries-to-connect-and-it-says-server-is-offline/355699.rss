    <title>My friend tries to connect and it says &quot;server is offline&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-friend-tries-to-connect-and-it-says-server-is-offline/355699</link>
    <description>when my friend tries to join my server, it says server is offline for him, i tried on my laptop and it was fine.


also he was having trouble with compiling errors, he said it said somthing like &quot;error trying to-&quot;
then the next line said &quot;finished!&quot;

im really sorry if i am being very vague, but if you think the problem is his compiler, i will try to find the exact words for it.</description>

              <p>you got to portforward and then change the ip in the gui or client folder depends on what source your using. Then the compiling error download the new jdk and edit it and fix the update on the notes of the compiler to jdk.6.0_21</p>
