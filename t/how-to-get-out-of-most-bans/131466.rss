    <title>How to get out of MOST bans</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-out-of-most-bans/131466</link>
    <description>Well, heres what I have used in the pass, and what my buddies have used: 


1. Breaking Rule 1, Offensive Language: 

~ This is VERY hard to get out of. The best way to get out if it is to say it was a typo, but you must think of a VERY GOOD SIMILAR word that could have been the error. 

&amp;&amp; BUT REMEMBER &amp;&amp; 

If the word you said is CENSORED... then its not breaking the rule! Only by bypassing the censor is it a Violation. 

2. Breaking Rule 2, Item Scamming: 

~ The best way to get out of this is to switch it over to breaking rule 6, which is LESS black marks, then, hopefully, you can get a new JMOD to get you out of rule 6. Heh. 

Tell them that you acidently said your password at the breakfast table in the ears of your brother, whos account was banned earlier that year due to item scamming. He got onto your account, and scammed for his new lvl 3 skiller. Also, when you send this to them, assure that you have changed your password to a good, very good, password. 

3. Breaking Rule 3, Password Scamming: 

Take the Rule 2 text, and switch it from little brother, to friend at school. 

4. Breaking Rule 4, Cheating/ Bug Abuse: 

~ Fuck... I dunno. Anyone get one and ill post it. 

5. Breaking Rule 5, Jagex Staff Impersonation: 

~ Tell them that you participated in a massive keylogging episode, and that you just got your computer back from the shop because it had several trojans and keyloggers. And that most the people that participated in it was from Myspace (just an example), but your password was hacked. 

6. Breaking Rule 6, Account Trading/Sharing: 

~ Tell them that a friend at school overheard your password at lunch. He was blackmailing you, and told you that if you dont give him ( Insert random ammount of random objecy here), that you will never get your account back. Tell them you recoverd your password, and that he is no longer your friend. 


All the other rules are gay and you dont get very many marks (like under 1, like a .3 blackmark). Post here if you REALLY want the others. 


PS: 

Ill post the other lies later.</description>

<p>Very simple actually. Their no sharing rule in terms of family has a hole in which if you do ask them as i did they will let daughters/sons of very young age use the account so as long as no major actions are done. but Seriously ask them if your daughter/son could use the account because you are unable to say no. IF YOU ASK YOU WOULD BE AMAZED.</p>

              <p>Well, heres what I have used in the pass, and what my buddies have used:</p>
<ol>
<li>Breaking Rule 1, Offensive Language:</li>
</ol>
<p>~ This is VERY hard to get out of. The best way to get out if it is to say it was a typo, but you must think of a VERY GOOD SIMILAR word that could have been the error.</p>
<p>&amp;&amp; BUT REMEMBER &amp;&amp;</p>
<p>If the word you said is CENSORED… then its not breaking the rule! Only by bypassing the censor is it a Violation.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Breaking Rule 2, Item Scamming:</li>
</ol>
<p>~ The best way to get out of this is to switch it over to breaking rule 6, which is LESS black marks, then, hopefully, you can get a new JMOD to get you out of rule 6. Heh.</p>
<p>Tell them that you acidently said your password at the breakfast table in the ears of your brother, whos account was banned earlier that year due to item scamming. He got onto your account, and scammed for his new lvl 3 skiller. Also, when you send this to them, assure that you have changed your password to a good, very good, password.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Breaking Rule 3, Password Scamming:</li>
</ol>
<p>Take the Rule 2 text, and switch it from little brother, to friend at school.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Breaking Rule 4, Cheating/ Bug Abuse:</li>
</ol>
<p>~ Fuck… I dunno. Anyone get one and ill post it.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Breaking Rule 5, Jagex Staff Impersonation:</li>
</ol>
<p>~ Tell them that you participated in a massive keylogging episode, and that you just got your computer back from the shop because it had several trojans and keyloggers. And that most the people that participated in it was from Myspace (just an example), but your password was hacked.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Breaking Rule 6, Account Trading/Sharing:</li>
</ol>
<p>~ Tell them that a friend at school overheard your password at lunch. He was blackmailing you, and told you that if you dont give him ( Insert random ammount of random objecy here), that you will never get your account back. Tell them you recoverd your password, and that he is no longer your friend.</p>
<p>All the other rules are gay and you dont get very many marks (like under 1, like a .3 blackmark). Post here if you REALLY want the others.</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Ill post the other lies later.</p>
