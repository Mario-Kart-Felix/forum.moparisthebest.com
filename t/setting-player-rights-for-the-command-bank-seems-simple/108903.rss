    <title>Setting player rights for the command ::bank ----seems simple :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-player-rights-for-the-command-bank-seems-simple/108903</link>
    <description>i have been trying to set the player rights for the command ::bank so that only mods and admins can use this command. for my source 0=player 1=mod 2=admin i thought the easiest way to do this would be simply to cut this

&lt;blockquote&gt;} else if (command.startsWith(&quot;bank&quot;))	 {
				openUpBank();&lt;/blockquote&gt;
out of the client.java where it was under public commands and into admin command section i then used my complier but have come across this error  &lt;blockquote&gt;client.java:4331: illegal start of expression
        } public void fromBank(int itemID, int fromSlot, int amount) {
          ^
1 error
Files Compiled Successfully!
Press any key to continue . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;

i have also tried adding player rights to the command itself but it doesnt seem to work. can anyone help me please??</description>

              <p>I want to change it to admin only because the whole reason most of the skills take time to level is because a player only has 28 inventory spaces to use. If they have accesss to the bank the can just stand and mine all day long and get ridculous amonunts of ore whereas if they dont it will take that little bit longer making it more of a sense of achievement wen they actually get somewhere.</p>

If it is the command missing a bracket, adding one to the bottom would make the void ignore the rest of the commands between bank and the end, which could be fatal.</p>
