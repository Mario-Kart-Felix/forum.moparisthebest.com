    <description>Hi everyone,


I couldn&#39;t find it in the megathread, so if someone could help me I would appreciate it.

What is required to run MoparScape 3.2 w/ Aryan?

When I tried running it with the latest Java, it started loading for all of 1.5 seconds and then closed.
When I tried running it with Java 6u45, it gave me the following: http://prnt.sc/aaj112

All assistance is greatly appreciated. I&#39;d love to start playing with this again</description>
