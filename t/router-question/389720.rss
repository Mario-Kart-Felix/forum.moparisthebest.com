    <title>Router Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/router-question/389720</link>
    <description>Alright, I&#39;m on the main computer at the moment with the router and modem set up and all. Though I have a little question as I&#39;ve been having some recent problems lately.

The connection between the Xbox router, and my laptop from my room is starting to go a little slow now, and this has never happened before. Conor (The Soul) thinks it&#39;s because of someone connecting to this connection, and said I need to put a password on it.

I took his advice and I logged onto the router page, and attempted to change the passphrase, but the password was wrong as it seems.

So I have at least two questions:

1. Is it possible for them to change the password even if they didn&#39;t know the origianl passphrase?

2. If this isn&#39;t the case, what else could make my internet connection slower?
- Conor said that it might be the amount of bandwidth or something taking a lot of bandwith amount, so what I could do about this, if it is?

Another thing, I have looked at the connection logs and I found this:
[DHCP IP: (192.168.1.4)] to MAC address 00:03:7F:8E:6B:90, Tuesday, Apr 05,2011 19:28:11
Does the &#39;MAC&#39; address mean it&#39;s a computer; Mac? I&#39;m not too familiar with all that kind of stuff.

And looking at these security options:
None - no data encryption 
WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy, use WEP 64- or 128-bit data encryption 
WPA-PSK [TKIP] - Wi-Fi Protected Access with Pre-Shared Key, use WPA-PSK standard encryption with TKIP encryption type 
WPA2-PSK [AES] - Wi-Fi Protected Access version 2 with Pre-Shared Key, use WPA2-PSK standard encryption with the AES encryption type 
WPA-PSK [TKIP] + WPA2-PSK [AES] - Allow clients using either WPA-PSK [TKIP] or WPA2-PSK [AES] 

Which one should I use for the most protection?

Thanks,
Ix Soulcist xI</description>

I end the tree process the minute the download is over. I have a total of 71 torrents downloaded. So I suppose that might be the reason or at least part of it.</p>
<p>I added the passwords, and their seems to be a nice amount of difference so far. I suppose someone was connecting to it but then again, I had my laptop and main computer disconnected from the router.</p>

<p>Alright, I set a password on the connection and I’ll see how that works out. Overall, I have three things on the connection (Xbox, Laptop, and Main Computer). So we’ll see how that goes I suppose.</p>
<p>What can I do about the use of the bandwidth as far as cleaning it up or something, make more space or whatever I can do?</p>

              <p>Thanks a lot, this does help indeed.</p>
<p>One more thing, when I disconnet my laptop from the router connection, it seems that another name pops out of nowhere. It’s called MYBLUERAYPLAYER, and when I connect my laptop back, it just simply goes to Laptop, so I suppose that is what my Laptop is called even though it does have a CD-ROM (Netbook - Mini Laptop). So I suppose that part is a bit covered.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was wrong about the password, I was in the wrong part of the settings for the password. I will come back to this thread in a moment to post if I haven’t fixed it and hope to get some more ideas.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/coonhunter">@CoonHunter</a>: I’m on Frostwire a lot downloading a lot of movies, but not at one time and it doesn’t take that long for them to download, would that or even might be the problem?

              <p>In regards to someone changing the password on your wireless it is possible given that you left your router with the default username and password. If the ‘hacker’ (not literally) was even somewhat computer savvy they would realize with a quick google search that the default username and password for most routers are simply “admin”, “password”.</p>
<p>Once they are logged into your router they can do pretty much anything they want with it, including setting a password on your wireless. It probably varies from router to router but on mine you don’t need the previous passkey to change the current passkey. If the ‘hacker’ did indeed change the password and you do need the current password to change the password then you can simply reset your router. There is usually a reset button on the router somewhere.</p>
<p>As for which protection type to use; I’m not really sure which is more secure, a quick google could probably tell you, but at my house I use: WPA-PSK [TKIP] - Wi-Fi Protected Access with Pre-Shared Key, use WPA-PSK standard encryption with TKIP encryption type</p>
<p>Good luck with figuring everything out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>With it being only 5 days (6 in some area’s) into the month, your bandwidth shouldn’t be a problem unless you have torrented a shitload of things in the past few days lol. There is a few things that can do this though.<br>
like:<br>
[ul][li]Bandwidth maxed out (they will slow your intenret when this hapens, but you shouldn’t have that issue yet)[/li]<br>
[li]Someone is using your internet to torrent/download many files (as you were told from Conor)[/li]<br>
[li]Low connection strength from router (in my house i can get max internet speed i pay or, outside i barely get half)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Anyways, WEP is the most common encryption used that I know of (at least around here), and depending on the router, can be brute forced. Although, unless whoever is usingyour internet has recourses and knowledge to NEED your internet, they won’t bother once you set a password. I would go with any encryption.</p>
<p>About the Mac address, its just the computer, doesn’t specify that its a Mac computer, PSP’s tell you their mac address in the system settings and such.</p>
<p>Sorry I wasn’t much help, but hey, every little bit of info counts right?</p>
