    <description>Hey haters,
Everyone basically hates me for my hard work,
Anyways.
I am making a Starting place when you first arrive at login.
Then you have to do the full starting.
I got a questions.
this what i wanna do.
So you know.
I wanna make a place like in real rs you cant tele away in the starter part.
Then you talk to the npc and gives u a net.
Then after, you talk to the npc again after u got the shirmps and tele to the cooking place.
Then at the cooking place u talk to the cook. He tells you to cook the shrimp. Then you cook it.
You talk to him again and he teleports you once again. to the dungeon place. You fight the rats and you finally get teled back to the Home. And you get runes and stuff.
How can i do this?
I first i wanna disable teleporting on that island.
Then i wanna do the rest up.
Anyone know how to do this?

1. How do i make it so u cant tele in a place like with Postions X, Y
2. How to talk to a npc and gives item.
3. After you talk it teleports you.</description>
