    <title>Looking for Other Developers [667]</title>

    <description>Hello, Moparscape!  I&#39;ve been a lurker in RSPS server development for a couple of years now, watching the community evolve and change as time went on, but now I&#39;ve decided to put my foot in the door and begin work on my own private server.  As someone majoring in software development right now in college, along with ~5 years of experience programming with Java C, and C++, I enjoy working on stuff like this.  Over the past couple of weeks, I&#39;ve been steadily working on the server and have gotten it close to a releasable state.  However, after it&#39;s released, we have very big plans.  We are going to overhaul the entire current weapon crafting system to make it more rewarding, with features such as the potential creation of dragon weaponry and other various ideas we&#39;ve been bouncing around.  As we near release, we&#39;ve decided to have two branches to the server, those being the primary branch where the tested content will be, and the experimental branch where we will be pushing hot off the press updates.  In order to accomplish everything in an efficient manner, we are temporarily looking for other developers to sign onto the cause.  We&#39;re not offering a payment for your help as you&#39;re more a member of the team than you are a hired help if you decide you&#39;re interested.  We have a teamspeak we use to discuss things related and unrelated to the server, which you&#39;ll be expected to join on at least occasion to discuss plans for the server.  If you&#39;ve gotten this far without closing the page, then you should probably apply using the guideline below:

Name: 
Age: 
Development Experience: 
Contact Email: 
In two sentences, explain why you want to join the team: 
Anything else you feel worthy of mention: 

You are welcome to submit your application by one of three ways
1) Emailing me at aevum.kairos@gmail.com (fastest way of getting a reply)
2) Sending me a private message through Moparscape
3) Replying to this post

Thanks for taking the time to read this post.  Now go on and apply!</description>
