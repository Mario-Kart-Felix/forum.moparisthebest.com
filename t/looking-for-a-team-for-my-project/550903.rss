    <title>Looking for a team for my project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-team-for-my-project/550903</link>
    <description>Hey guys!
so first let me introduce myself:&quot;
my name is ahmad, i&#39;m a 17 years old guy from israel.
i&#39;ve been developing php, html, java scripting and sql for 4 years now, i&#39;ve had a rs service page for few years and recieved a great respond and made some money:P
anyways i&#39;ve had a rsps in 2011 named jokerscapex i believe it was a 317 source, i&#39;ve closed it because i couldn&#39;t pay for the VPS anymore so uhmm whatever.
I&#39;ve been interested in those new versions of sources for a while now and decided to try my luck again on RSPS.
i&#39;ve created a new server and named the project TechnoX-Pkz and i&#39;m looking for a support team for my server.

positions available:
GFX Developer: Must be a pro with using photoshop etc. i don&#39;t really know much about GFX lol so whatever.
Website Developer: Must have great knowledge with PHP, HTML, SQL at least.
Coder: Must be able to code well not just a coder in name.

I&#39;ll be running few test before accepting anyone to join the team.
I&#39;ll cover all the expenses regarding the VPS, Webhosting and advertising.

What will u get from all that:
a forum rank.
an ingame rank
if u really start proving yourself trusted i&#39;ll consider to start paying you (if shit succeeds ofc)

website shit thats added:
100% working highscores with signature for each user.
voting system.
IPB forums 100% coded.
webclient.
jarred client done.
contact us.

website future:
login from ur ingame account and access to cpanel.
store with auto claim shit ingame.

ingame shit: i&#39;ll give u link to website to server once i accept ur application bc it&#39;s still in beta and i don&#39;t want to public it yet.

anyways i&#39;m serious about this project and hopefully i can have ur cooperation.

add my skype for more details: Joker678.pb

and btw i&#39;ve been registered on here since 2011 so uhmm that should be a proof that i&#39;ve been into rsps for a while.

Thanks.</description>
