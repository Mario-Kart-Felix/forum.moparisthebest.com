    <title>Snow Cache - Make terrain white, trees white, and tree icons white</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/snow-cache-make-terrain-white-trees-white-and-tree-icons-white/286758</link>
    <description>Well, this was originally for my new server (Which is still nameless... *sigh*) but it just didn&#39;t look right with flowers blooming out of the ground.

So, basically, this turns the grass white (Along with some other ground types. I didn&#39;t change all of them, as there were risks as to ruining them.), makes tree tops completely white, and makes the tree icons on the minimap white. I did it with the cache suite, but there&#39;s many people who don&#39;t know how to use it, and I&#39;ve gotten many people asking how I made the terrain white and making it snow in Back to Basics.

If you want it to snow in your server, here&#39;s the method.
[code]	public void setWeather(int weatherId)
	{
		outStream.createFrame(208);
		outStream.writeWordBigEndian_dup(weatherId);
	}[/code]
And to use that, put this in your process boolean (In client.java of course).
[code]setWeather(11877);[/code]

Now, I suppose you want the cache download. I guess you want pictures too. Well, I don&#39;t have a picture. [b]Anyone who wants to give me a picture, please do so.[/b]

[b]Download the cache here:[/b] http://www.mediafire.com/?y2iwnl5zyyz

If anyone&#39;s wondering, I based it off of Bluurr&#39;s client cache ([b]THE ONE EDITED, SO DON&#39;T WORRY! IT&#39;S NOT GLITCHED![/b]) so there might be some files in there that aren&#39;t needed.

Note that you might want to put the client in low detail. To do that, look at the init method in your client&#39;s client.java. If I remember correctly, you comment out method50(); and then add method77((byte)*something here*);. Just look at another client to see how it&#39;s done.

So, enjoy.
