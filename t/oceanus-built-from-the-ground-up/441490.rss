    <title>Oceanus - Built from the ground up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/oceanus-built-from-the-ground-up/441490</link>
    <description>[center][b]Welcome to my project thread, I have seen multiple threads seeing people trying to create there own frameworks etc which has kind of inspired me to go and try to the same.  Basically i&#39;m going to be writing it from scratch using the Netty library and using the Netty docs on the website.  Anyways I will probably upload the source using git and let you guys watch me build upon it.[/b]

- Media none atm

Also guys the thread will be expanded upon tomorrow etc[/center]</description>

Hey I added you on MSN, mine is <a href="mailto:technology@live.com">technology@live.com</a></p>
<p>I want to suggest to you to use blocking IO instead of heavyweight libraries like Netty/MINA or even Java NIO.<br>

Yeah, let’s create a thread for every single player.[/quote]You aren’t forced to create a thread for every player. If you want to, then it’s fine as well. I don’t really recommend thread-per-client unless you’re using a core-happy machine.</p>

<p>The guy has a point. And whatever you said is non complacent to any modern design strategy other than WL. Dumb asses won’t even finish projects because they don’t know how to design around the updating protocols more than just getting the networking up and running.</p>
