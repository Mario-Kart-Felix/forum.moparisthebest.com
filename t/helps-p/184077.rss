Well &gt;.&gt; We’ll have to start from the small stuff to the bigger stuff.</p>
<p>1.When you said you couldn’t log onto your own server, what did you put for server ip?<br>
2. Sure that your ip never changed overtime when you didn’t have windows?<br>
3. What kind of router do you have if you have one anyways. If it is wireless, a few things you can do. Find that blue cord in the back and (your on your own &gt;.&gt; I was going to do this but didn’t want to risk) You can’t portforward on a wireless router on a computer unless it is a laptop.</p>
<p>I can’t help you much unless it is linksys[/quote]</p>
<p>-.- dont need to type in your ip for your own server<br>
it took 4 hours to re-install it highly doubt it changed<br>
dont think its my router cus ive had my server for over 7 months</p>
