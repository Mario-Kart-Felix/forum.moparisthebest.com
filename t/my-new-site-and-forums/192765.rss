    <description>Hey guys I have been around for a very long time in runescape cheating communities that date to some of the most original fourms such as bovinelabs staying in the background learning and every now and then spaming the boards with badly typed posts and topics ( not really spam but very hard to understand tutorials and scripts and the some private server stuff ) but now im just posting that I have remade my crappy piece of the Internet [url=http://www.newguy45.com]www.newguy45.com[/url] in to a less crappy piece of the Internet ( although it is still pretty crappy ) but now my site is current and has a nice Simple Machines Forum like moparisthebest but a whole hella lot less massive I literally have like ... six or seven members so I&#39;f you would like to check out a nice forum which should stay relatively small come check us out we talk alot about business and religion and politics ( the fun nontalkables ) and we have our downloads section and a graphics section. I&#39;m pretty much hosting it and my friends site all by myself so if things seem slow bear with me. Come join us if you want to make some new friends and have a little fun, hope to see most of you there!
