    <description>Hey guys, so I&#39;m currently developing a Internet Web browser in Visual Basic. I am about 40% complete.

What I am posting this thread for is because I need [u]YOU[/u]to suggest some names for it, please don&#39;t post names of browsers that have already been made as they are most likely copy right, and I don&#39;t want to copy them either.

If a mod/admin has a problem with this thread, then feel free to go right ahead and lock it.</description>

              <p>I’m horrible with names but I have some suggestions for you.</p>
<p>-Use C#, it’s much better for making applications<br>
-Use the Gecko component to embed Firefox into your application, rather than Internet explorer<br>

<p>If I do think of some names I will come back and mention them.</p>
