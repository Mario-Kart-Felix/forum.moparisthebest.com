    <title>[317][Devolution]Running client and getting error?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-devolution-running-client-and-getting-error/369716</link>
    <description>Ok, I have it allllll set up and stuff. Nothing to worry about, I could get on fine before. Then, I tried running, and this happened.

(I blocked the server name out.)

I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s wrong. Help?

Also, whenever I try running, the file at the bottom pops up, even though I already have a cache.</description>
