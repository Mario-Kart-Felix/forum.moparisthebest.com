        <p>ok, i have a major exam in 33 hours that i have done almost no study for, hell, i have never even read the book “othello”, although i was present when it was being studied in class, and i did study alot of it, so i grasp all the basic concepts being brought across:<br>
-othello is a black man in white mans society<br>
-othello only attained his present position because of military superiority<br>
-venetians viewed othello as being primal and “below” them in a sense.<br>
-the thinly shrouded veil of othello’s equality with the venetians is ripped away when he marries desdamona.<br>
-othello is too trusting of others<br>
-Othello descends into madness from iago’s baiting</p>
<p>and i also have watched the movie O plenty of times:<br>
-odin is a black kid at an all white school<br>
-odin only attained his present position because of his sporting prowess<br>
-white people view othello as being “different”<br>
-the dean gets pissed at odin for gettin wiv his daughta(sorry for this line, but i cant think of any other way of putting it. in contrast to othello, the rest of the community still accepts him)<br>
-odin trusts hugo too much<br>
-odin descends into madness from hugo’s baiting. the cocaine doesnt help either.</p>
<p>basically, what im after is as much information as possible that someone can give me about the relationships between the 2 texts when it comes to “text and context”<br>
im really after a band 6(i think its the equivalent of a GPA of 4.0) which is basically the highest mark possible.<br>
according to the board of studies website, to attain a band 6, one must:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">· displays a highly developed ability to describe and analyse a broad range of language forms,
features and structures of texts and explain the ways these shape meaning and influence
responses in a variety of texts and contexts.
· presents a critical, refined personal response showing highly developed skills in
