        <p>[quote=“Teem_Rocket, post:99, topic:522611”][b]Regained his footing and began sprinting towards the nearest city of <em>INSERTCITY</em>. Once the Man became tired and eventually exhausted his energy, he decided he had eluded whatever evil or manner of spirit could produce such hellish and malevolent sounds. It was not an ordinary scream, nor a scream of surprise. It was the type of scream that leaves an imprint burned into your mind, because it is a very unique and terrifying sound on a primitive level. It is<br>
the scream of death. Having served in the army of <em>INSERTFACTION</em>, the Man had heard this scream before on the field of battle.</p>
<p>Once the Man started to recover from severe shock and panic, he noticed that he was bleeding. As he quickly tore the remnants of the cloth shirt away, the Man discovered to his horror that he had a symbol imprinted upon his stomach. It was as if it had been burned into the skin, and was smeared in blood from an open gash caused by his earlier fall when attempting to flee.</p>
<p>Having sustained potentially dangerous injuries, he comes to the conclusion that he is too exhausted and with his wound. He cannot continue forward until daybreak. During his sleep, a message interrupts the slumber. A cut-scene occurs in which a Tainted Banshee awakens the Man via howling and screaming coming from deep within the forest. It seemed that with each passing wail of absolute terror, that the sound was drawing much closer at each new noise. The man awakens to confusion, mixed thoughts, shock, fright anger, grief, dread, and his wound paining him terribly. As he attempts to flee, he is overcome by a feeling of extreme exhaustion and dread. The Banshee telepathically convinces the Man that she is an Angel attempting to free him from a curse which had been placed upon him by a Witch – whose property the Man had trespassed upon earlier that same day during his journey. He recalls the quaint wooden home located deep within a sea of trees, and concludes that this must be the case. The Banshee instructs the Man, that the only way to end his torture, is to remove the menacing mark which the curse had burned into his skin. The Man agrees that this must be the solution, and that he will extract revenge upon the Witch once he rids himself of her foul forbidden arts. As he draws his dagger from the sheathe on his ankle, he lusts for the blood of the evil Witch and wishes to end her life by his own hands. The Man starts eagerly slashing away and attempting to cut away the skin which the curse had burned. As he continues, with his lusts, quickly diminishing mental capacity, and the absolute state of shock he was in, he feels no pain; only the pressure from the blade poking and then piercing his innards. For each slash and cut, the screaming anguish seems to be getting louder and more clear… This only emboldens the Man to strive in his pursuit to rid himself of his cursed flesh and pillage the Witch’s cabin once he takes her life as compensation for his wounds. At this point, the intense screams of death and howling of absolute wickedness become unbearable. Any sane thoughts which were left within the mortal vanished at that time. The Man began frantically stabbing himself in his stomach over-and-over again without hesitation or pause. He began bleeding profusely, and in a matter of minutes, was lying on the forest floor losing his very essence of life – his lifeblood – to this abomination of pure evil. The Man tried to raise up to speak to the aberration, but was able to achieve no more than a sitting position. Slumped over and feeling his soul’s flame rapidly being extinguished by his own blood of guilt and lust, he looks towards the evil being who had deceived him into wishing to murder a women in cold blood, and then convinced him to take his own life in a moment of temporary insanity which was fueled by the Banshee’s Mark it had placed upon his body, and the torture of the hellish screams of death… Which were unending and without pause in his mind. The Banshee calmly smiles at the Man, and says in a human-like voice, “Thank you, kind sir”. The Man checked himself to assure his shattered mind that he was not hallucinating or imagining the demonic entity giving him thanks and praise. He quickly slapped himself and checked his wound. It was all too real. Once the Man had realized this, the Banshee acknowledged his thoughts telepathically, and appeared face-to-face with the Man. It then morphed It’s self into the form of a beautiful young women. “What trickery is this now, foul demon”? Said the Man in a voice strained by the pain of his self-inflicted wounds, as he spat a mouthful of his own blood onto the forest floor. By this time, the Man was almost surrounded in a puddle of his own blood; days; perhaps weeks away from mortal contact or any hope of survival. The beautiful young women replied, “This is not a trick. I invited and took on the form of a Wailing Banshee in search of the blood of a young Male mortal warrior. You perfectly fit the profile requirements of the ritual’s victim needed for my spell. I desire to be able to attract any Man, so that I may eventually lead them to their own death at their own hands inflicted by their own motives and desires.” The Man glanced at the Witch who looked so innocent in her appearance and persona seemed harmless. He attempted to say something and moved his lips, but yet no sound was heard. The Man motioned for the women to move in closer so that she be able to hear his final words. Once the women was listening for the sound of his last breath, with the accuracy of a true warrior, the Man in one swift motion donned a dagger concealed on his other ankle, and thrust the sharp curved blade through the Witch’s blackened heart. The Man leaned over to her now expiring body - soon to be corpse, and surgically sliced her neck so that she would bleed out instantaneously. He now knew that he had made his peace and would not be punished in his afterlife for any deeds which were to be his, because he had sacrificed his own life to end the life of an evil-doer.</p>
<p>In the Warrior’s Order in which he served, if you die in honor by slaying an evil being, they believe you are to be exalted in the afterlife as a Warrior of Renown and Knowledge.<br>
