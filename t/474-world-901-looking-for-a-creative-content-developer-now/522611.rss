    <title>[474]World 901 - Looking for a creative content developer now!</title>

    <description>[center][img]http://puu.sh/3jKF4.jpg[/img][/center]

[b]NOTE: There are 2 worlds in this server. World 1 and World 901. The world World 901 will be called w901 and when I make a reference to the server as a whole, I will say World 901![/b]

I&#39;ve decided to arrange a new development. This project I am sure will not end up like my previous server, FroyoScape. FroyoScape had financial issues, now we do not.

World 901, at the beginning, will consist of one world, World 1. Later on, when we get around 50+ active players, we&#39;ll make a second world, w901. World 1 and w901 differ a lot.

The accounts are synchronized in both worlds. World 1 is the &#39;economy&#39; world, and w901 (I have named it w901 in this thread so the naming is not confused) is the &#39;everywhere-PKing world&#39;. W901 is suppose to be for those high-riskers (partly the reason why we will activate it after a while). Just find anyone, anywhere and kill them. W901 should be taken into consideration if you want to have the same possibility to kill the foe and to be killed. Its do or die, there is no escape. However, you will respawn in some random place in the map (dw, its not from a randomizer, I have specific [b]locations[/b] (keep the &#39;s&#39; in note)), just for your safety. You will also respawn in a place where it is safe every time you log in, just so you don&#39;t login and get killed by spawn killers.

[u]So, I can consider World 901 as a PKing server?[/u]
The truth is, World 1 is going to be more worked on, just due to the fact that there is much more to do there. It will consist more of skilling, minigames, and (hopefully) unique content rather than a circle based on PKing.

Thank you,

<p>Will you follow, respect, and maintain any rules set for the beta testing: Absolutely, I would never do anything to ruin my chances of being with the World 901 community.</p>
<p>Do you have any recommendations: Possibly adding a prestige system in the server allowing players titles and more advanced wepons, etc.</p>

Once the Man became tired and eventually exhausted his energy, he decided he had eluded whatever evil or manner of spirit could produce such hellish and malevolent sounds. It was not an ordinary scream, nor a scream of surprise. It was the type of scream that leaves an imprint burned into your mind, because it is a very unique and terrifying sound on a primitive level.

the scream of death. Having served in the army of <em>INSERTFACTION</em>, the Man had heard this scream before on the field of battle.</p>
<p>Once the Man started to recover from severe shock and panic, he noticed that he was bleeding. As he quickly tore the remnants of the cloth shirt away, the Man discovered to his horror that he had a symbol imprinted upon his stomach. It was as if it had been burned into the skin, and was smeared in blood from an open gash caused by his earlier fall when attempting to flee.</p>
<p>Having sustained potentially dangerous injuries, he comes to the conclusion that he is too exhausted and with his wound. He cannot continue forward until daybreak. During his sleep, a message interrupts the slumber. A cut-scene occurs in which a Tainted Banshee awakens the Man via howling and screaming coming from deep within the forest. It seemed that with each passing wail of absolute terror, that the sound was drawing much closer at each new noise. The man awakens to confusion, mixed thoughts, shock, fright anger, grief, dread, and his wound paining him terribly. As he attempts to flee, he is overcome by a feeling of extreme exhaustion and dread. The Banshee telepathically convinces the Man that she is an Angel attempting to free him from a curse which had been placed upon him by a Witch – whose property the Man had trespassed upon earlier that same day during his journey. He recalls the quaint wooden home located deep within a sea of trees, and concludes that this must be the case. The Banshee instructs the Man, that the only way to end his torture, is to remove the menacing mark which the curse had burned into his skin. The Man agrees that this must be the solution, and that he will extract revenge upon the Witch once he rids himself of her foul forbidden arts. As he draws his dagger from the sheathe on his ankle, he lusts for the blood of the evil Witch and wishes to end her life by his own hands. The Man starts eagerly slashing away and attempting to cut away the skin which the curse had burned. As he continues, with his lusts, quickly diminishing mental capacity, and the absolute state of shock he was in, he feels no pain; only the pressure from the blade poking and then piercing his innards. For each slash and cut, the screaming anguish seems to be getting louder and more clear… This only emboldens the Man to strive in his pursuit to rid himself of his cursed flesh and pillage the Witch’s cabin once he takes her life as compensation for his wounds. At this point, the intense screams of death and howling of absolute wickedness become unbearable. Any sane thoughts which were left within the mortal vanished at that time. The Man began frantically stabbing himself in his stomach over-and-over again without hesitation or pause. He began bleeding profusely, and in a matter of minutes, was lying on the forest floor losing his very essence of life – his lifeblood – to this abomination of pure evil. The Man tried to raise up to speak to the aberration, but was able to achieve no more than a sitting position. Slumped over and feeling his soul’s flame rapidly being extinguished by his own blood of guilt and lust, he looks towards the evil being who had deceived him into wishing to murder a women in cold blood, and then convinced him to take his own life in a moment of temporary insanity which was fueled by the Banshee’s Mark it had placed upon his body, and the torture of the hellish screams of death… Which were unending and without pause in his mind. The Banshee calmly smiles at the Man, and says in a human-like voice, “Thank you, kind sir”. The Man checked himself to assure his shattered mind that he was not hallucinating or imagining the demonic entity giving him thanks and praise. He quickly slapped himself and checked his wound. It was all too real. Once the Man had realized this, the Banshee acknowledged his thoughts telepathically, and appeared face-to-face with the Man. It then morphed It’s self into the form of a beautiful young women. “What trickery is this now, foul demon”? Said the Man in a voice strained by the pain of his self-inflicted wounds, as he spat a mouthful of his own blood onto the forest floor. By this time, the Man was almost surrounded in a puddle of his own blood; days; perhaps weeks away from mortal contact or any hope of survival. The beautiful young women replied, “This is not a trick. I invited and took on the form of a Wailing Banshee in search of the blood of a young Male mortal warrior. You perfectly fit the profile requirements of the ritual’s victim needed for my spell. I desire to be able to attract any Man, so that I may eventually lead them to their own death at their own hands inflicted by their own motives and desires.” The Man glanced at the Witch who looked so innocent in her appearance and persona seemed harmless. He attempted to say something and moved his lips, but yet no sound was heard. The Man motioned for the women to move in closer so that she be able to hear his final words. Once the women was listening for the sound of his last breath, with the accuracy of a true warrior, the Man in one swift motion donned a dagger concealed on his other ankle, and thrust the sharp curved blade through the Witch’s blackened heart. The Man leaned over to her now expiring body - soon to be corpse, and surgically sliced her neck so that she would bleed out instantaneously. He now knew that he had made his peace and would not be punished in his afterlife for any deeds which were to be his, because he had sacrificed his own life to end the life of an evil-doer.</p>
<p>In the Warrior’s Order in which he served, if you die in honor by slaying an evil being, they believe you are to be exalted in the afterlife as a Warrior of Renown and Knowledge.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">I believe that there’s no disputing who the most creative Content Designer on these forums is. I want to see some unique ideas come to life sooner than we can make them happen due to workload size. I also posses a large amount of experience and innovation in terms of Design for R.S.P.S. I’ve contributed multiple files, filled, with design concepts and snippets for the community to use. These files covered almost every aspect of R.S.P.S. and included several entirely new and original mechanics, features, gameplay mechanics, content, story, and the base for much more to be built upon. I have seen but a couple of these designs come to fruition <span class="bbcode-i">in the hands of others</span>. Since these are not acted upon and used as a reference or base for brainstorms, and my attempts at somehow bettering this community have failed – I refuse to release anymore hand-written design content (a large portion has only been seen by two sets of eyes; will remain unreleased until possible Server and Client-side implementation into Arcanum: Mysteria). I have been doing this for quite some time including my time spent in other communities, and I enjoy both programming (Development) and Designing equally. It doesn’t feel like work to me when I write out methods or convert over 9,000 symbols. I’m building upon something that will only improve and is my own project. A Client can be modified once so much knowledge has been obtained via Java, knowing how your Server and Client function, understanding Client-to-Server communications and visa-versa, and learning how to properly edit a Cache, re-naming and documenting all of the pieces of code you can get your paws on, organizing, and a restructure of your entire Base into an application that is not similar to a RuneScape-esque Client.</span></p>
<blockquote>Rate your creativity (1 - 10):</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">This is a silly goose question. If you ask a question like that, or, “Rate Your Programming Ability”, on these Forums – every newbie will of course lie in their application if they feel like doing so. They won’t hesitate to simply punch in the “8” key, or reply with, “9/10”. If I were going by a sensible scale, I would say most people in this community are around 2-5 and there are a handful above this ranging from 6-8. If you ask me in a sensible way, I would honestly say that when it comes to Content Design, I’m a 6 to a 9 depending on who is judging and the quality/quantity of hand-written Design Concepts. If we were to go by the scale which most of the others have posted, then I would say 9 or 10.</span></p>

For each slash and cut, the screaming anguish seems to be getting louder and more clear… This only emboldens the Man to strive in his pursuit to rid himself of his cursed flesh and pillage the Witch’s cabin once he takes her life as compensation for his wounds. At this point, the intense screams of death and howling of absolute wickedness become unbearable. Any sane thoughts which were left within the mortal vanished at that time. The Man began frantically stabbing himself in his stomach over-and-over again without hesitation or pause. He began bleeding profusely, and in a matter of minutes, was lying on the forest floor losing his very essence of life – his lifeblood – to this abomination of pure evil. The Man tried to raise up to speak to the aberration, but was able to achieve no more than a sitting position. Slumped over and feeling his soul’s flame rapidly being extinguished by his own blood of guilt and lust, he looks towards the evil being who had deceived him into wishing to murder a women in cold blood, and then convinced him to take his own life in a moment of temporary insanity which was fueled by the Banshee’s Mark it had placed upon his body, and the torture of the hellish screams of death… Which were unending and without pause in his mind. The Banshee calmly smiles at the Man, and says in a human-like voice, “Thank you, kind sir”. The Man checked himself to assure his shattered mind that he was not hallucinating or imagining the demonic entity giving him thanks and praise. He quickly slapped himself and checked his wound. It was all too real. Once the Man had realized this, the Banshee acknowledged his thoughts telepathically, and appeared face-to-face with the Man. It then morphed It’s self into the form of a beautiful young women. “What trickery is this now, foul demon”? Said the Man in a voice strained by the pain of his self-inflicted wounds, as he spat a mouthful of his own blood onto the forest floor. By this time, the Man was almost surrounded in a puddle of his own blood; days; perhaps weeks away from mortal contact or any hope of survival. The beautiful young women replied, “This is not a trick. I invited and took on the form of a Wailing Banshee in search of the blood of a young Male mortal warrior. You perfectly fit the profile requirements of the ritual’s victim needed for my spell. I desire to be able to attract any Man, so that I may eventually lead them to their own death at their own hands inflicted by their own motives and desires.” The Man glanced at the Witch who looked so innocent in her appearance and persona seemed harmless. He attempted to say something and moved his lips, but yet no sound was heard. The Man motioned for the women to move in closer so that she be able to hear his final words. Once the women was listening for the sound of his last breath, with the accuracy of a true warrior, the Man in one swift motion donned a dagger concealed on his other ankle, and thrust the sharp curved blade through the Witch’s blackened heart. The Man leaned over to her now expiring body - soon to be corpse, and surgically sliced her neck so that she would bleed out instantaneously. He now knew that he had made his peace and would not be punished in his afterlife for any deeds which were to be his, because he had sacrificed his own life to end the life of an evil-doer.</p>
<p>In the Warrior’s Order in which he served, if you die in honor by slaying an evil being, they believe you are to be exalted in the afterlife as a Warrior of Renown and Knowledge.<br>

              <p>A man was walking down the hill and tripped. He found howls coming out of nowhere. Oh, it scared the heck out of him. He ran for his life… Whatever it was, it kept howling. The howling kept getting a lot louder, no matter how fast the man ran. Something, or someone jumped on the man, and the man fell down and bumped his head. The man saw a person on top of him. And it was none other than Arham. Arham started yelling at the man. The man was dazed after the bump on the head, so he had no idea what Arham was saying. So Arham pulled out a NotePad and wrote:</p>
<p><code>boolean isSinisoul;
if (isSinisoul == true) {
getOwned();
} else {
runAway();
}</code><br>
The man said that he was sinisoul. And then proceeded to say how the code Arham wrote down on NotePad was complete shit and that he should never code again because “I am a java guru, you are a stupid tutorial author”.<br>
That made Arham very angry. So he took out his Dragon claws and special attacked him to death. A nearby hunter heard the event and called the police. Arham explained to the police that sinisoul talked shit about his development, so the cops let him go for free (and a 24 hour lend for his dragon claws).</p>

Very nice! I love how you continued the story most of all.</p>

The man, thinking he could face this terror, turned around and unsheathed a wooden sword and yelled, "Come n' get some!"
