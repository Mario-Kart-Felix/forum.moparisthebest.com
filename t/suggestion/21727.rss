    <description>Is there a way to make a script/code for the site or whatever so that you have to read the stickies in a section before you can post in that section. For example if I wanted to post in the question section and I haven&#39;t before I would be required to read the sticky(s) before I could post. Maybe even be required to read the sticky(s) before you can even read the other posts, If you chose to do that then you could maybe be redirected to the sticky(s) before you can post/read anything else? I don&#39;t know if that is even possible but it doesn&#39;t seem like it would be that hard. I think this would cut down on all the spamming and topics that could be answered if people just read the sticky(s) first.</description>

              <p>imho it is possible, and very easy. i did it to my site b4 it got wiped, it used javascript to popup a window, they had to type in a code to close it, and the code was hidden in bold letters in the message, and it only explained that in a sentence close to the end of the message</p>

              <p>Or, is there a code that can be placed in the questions section [or any other section] that would force popup the Terms of Service page if your post count is &lt; 50?  That way if anyone should post an moparscape question in there again we can just insta-ban?</p>
