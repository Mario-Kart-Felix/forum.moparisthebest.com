    <description>Ok this forum is great and all but there is too much flaming and spamming going on. I&#39;ve been testing mopar by posting none useful posts, no one has even warned me yet (good thing and bad). In my opinion this forum will be awesome if you are more strict. This forum is starting to die meaning spamming, flaming, non useful posts on all of the boards. Go look in general discussion, I bet every thread in that section contains at least 2 flames and spams. This is the reason Mr.Chris left, he was an awesome moderator and community member but he left because this community is falling apart. I hardly come here anymore because I have noticed it is full of spam and flaming. The only [b]useful[/b] posters I see are, All administrators, global moderators, some community members, regecks, 93dcthugs93. Thats all I can think of now. Before Silab got banned no offense but it was moderated alot often, and better. Since she has been de-modded because of the keylogger shit it has turned into one massive flamming and spamming forum. Don&#39;t get me wrong there are a few sections with [b]a lot[/b] of helpful posts. Like the Java sections, there are tons of helpful people in there, along with web design for the most part. 

Just put this into consideration please?</description>

Also most of them can be helped with a “Helpdesk” forum. Also you could change the words “The banned words” so instead of “U,It’s replaced with you.”[/quote]<br>
Maybe a report board?</p>

              <p>Whether it’s useful is always going to be an issue. There are thousands of regulars, and all will have varying views as to what is useful and what isn’t. It’s all relative to who you are, how laid back you are, and how much you know.</p>
<p>For example, lets say I posted a program I made in the Java section. Mopar, k00dr, Krichevskoy and pplsuqbawlz might see it as the most useless topic out.<br>
On the other hand, maybe it’s my first GUI program and I spent a while working on it and thought it could use some feedback.<br>
Commenting on things like that is fine, but as I said, people should keep it constructive.<br>
Someone saying “You suck noob” isn’t going to tell me ‘which’ part of my Java program isn’t that great. Nor will it teach me anything.<br>
Compare that comment to this one:<br>
“Hey Lothy - Your program is ok. But I think you could work on the GUI a bit, it looks a little messy. That, and…”<br>
See which type of ‘comment’ is helpful?</p>
<p>This forum isn’t an all adult forum. There are people at the age of 12 and younger, all the way up to people in their 20s. There may even be older people.<br>
It will never be spam free. That’s like expecting an entire group of year 7 students at a public school to have the complete and correct school uniform <em>every</em> single day. It’s just not going to happen.</p>

Commenting on things is in no way spamming.</p>
<p>Posting criticism is fine, but keep it constructive, and unbiased if possible.<br>
Posting comments is fine too, but again, keep them constructive and unbiased.</p>
<p>Spamming is more or less the one line dumb ass remarks that find their way into topics.<br>
Stuff like /sarcasm, lol, wtf, and so on. They aren’t constructive, they don’t further people’s ability, and in no way to they help. They’re not even funny.</p>
<p>As I pointed out the other night to MybJames, I scrolled through most of his posts and they were one liners that were just flaming people. You shouldn’t join a community if you plan to be aggressive towards people. There are several of those tyrants going around the boards, and they’re the ones ultimately responsible.</p>
