        <p>Ok this forum is great and all but there is too much flaming and spamming going on. I’ve been testing mopar by posting none useful posts, no one has even warned me yet (good thing and bad). In my opinion this forum will be awesome if you are more strict. This forum is starting to die meaning spamming, flaming, non useful posts on all of the boards. Go look in general discussion, I bet every thread in that section contains at least 2 flames and spams. This is the reason Mr.Chris left, he was an awesome moderator and community member but he left because this community is falling apart. I hardly come here anymore because I have noticed it is full of spam and flaming. The only <span class="bbcode-b">useful</span> posters I see are, All administrators, global moderators, some community members, regecks, 93dcthugs93. Thats all I can think of now. Before Silab got banned no offense but it was moderated alot often, and better. Since she has been de-modded because of the keylogger shit it has turned into one massive flamming and spamming forum. Don’t get me wrong there are a few sections with <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span> of helpful posts. Like the Java sections, there are tons of helpful people in there, along with web design for the most part.</p>
<p>Just put this into consideration please?</p>

        <p>I agree. I notice a lot of flaming towards people who are participants in the Moparscape section of the forums too. I’d be a liar to say I wasn’t involved seeing as I often retaliate with a plethora of smart ass remarks, but the fact that they’re actually justified shows how appalling some people’s attitudes towards others are.</p>
<p>A lot of people have been lashing out at others for no particular reason; it really is making this place look like a joke, but it’s hardly something to blame on the Administrators or any of the mods.<br>
What is the problem however is the attitudes of people towards other people. Members of these forums seem to forget that they are talking to real people.<br>
I doubt many of you would walk up to your employer and give them a big “Fuck you Moparscape noob” or "GTFO <em>excess profanity goes here - use your imagination</em> ". If you did that in real life, there would be consequences; I know if I said that to my boss I’d be out of my workplace faster then the boy on a car ad can say “Zoom zoom”. If you swore at a police officer in some countries, you’d probably find yourself in the back of a police car.</p>
<p>See what I’m getting at? People wouldn’t, and for the most part don’t, do the aforementioned in real life, so why here? It’s a lack of respect to other users, and to Mopar and whoever else that may pay for the hosting for this community.</p>

        <p>Mods do a lot more than you think. Section mods can’t warn or ban people, so we need to post a request to ban/warn someone in our own little section.</p>
<p>I think the reason though, why people are breaking the rules, is because someone posts something a mod doesn’t see(example, ‘1337’ shit), or something and everyone else thinks it’s ok to post it too.</p>
<p>Also, your little <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,85222.msg911072.html#msg911072" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">flaming(yes it’s been reported - not by me)</a> isn’t doing much help either. If you have no respect for the rules, then the new people here will think it’s also ok to break the rules. Sure, quit if you want because of the flaming, spamming and shit, but don’t forget you helped to contribute to it.</p>

        <p>[quote=“The Un-Named, post:7, topic:60867”]Mods do a lot more than you think. Section mods can’t warn or ban people, so we need to post a request to ban/warn someone in our own little section.</p>
<p>I think the reason though, why people are breaking the rules, is because someone posts something a mod doesn’t see(example, ‘1337’ shit), or something and everyone else thinks it’s ok to post it too.</p>
<p>Also, your little <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,85222.msg911072.html#msg911072" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">flaming(yes it’s been reported - not by me)</a> isn’t doing much help either. If you have no respect for the rules, then the new people here will think it’s also ok to break the rules. Sure, quit if you want because of the flaming, spamming and shit, but don’t forget you helped to contribute to it.[/quote]<br>
That report, did you not see the first sentence? And yes I know they do alot but still, they may post in a thread full of spam and flame but yet they do not warn or delete the posts. Thats the main point of this thread to be stricter. Even one of the mods or admin I can’t remember posted that Moparisthebest is falling as a community in the community member section someone told me. Also maybe people start reporting posts more often.</p>
<p>And regecks is helpful if you ask him to and push him.</p>

Commenting on things is in no way spamming.</p>
<p>Posting criticism is fine, but keep it constructive, and unbiased if possible.<br>
Posting comments is fine too, but again, keep them constructive and unbiased.</p>
<p>Spamming is more or less the one line dumb ass remarks that find their way into topics.<br>
Stuff like /sarcasm, lol, wtf, and so on. They aren’t constructive, they don’t further people’s ability, and in no way do they help. They’re not even funny.</p>
<p>As I pointed out the other night to MybJames, I scrolled through most of his posts and they were one liners that were just flaming people. You shouldn’t join a community if you plan to be aggressive towards people. There are several of those tyrants going around the boards, and they’re the ones ultimately responsible.</p>

People aren’t going to rock up to the forums everyday and have a brand new program to post. Could you imagine how boring this place would be if there was absolutely no conversation going on?</p>

<p>No one said anything about you flaming? In general the community has really became a bunch of spammers, hopefully many people will start coming around.</p>

Commenting on things is in no way spamming.</p>
<p>Posting criticism is fine, but keep it constructive, and unbiased if possible.<br>
Posting comments is fine too, but again, keep them constructive and unbiased.</p>
<p>Spamming is more or less the one line dumb ass remarks that find their way into topics.<br>
Stuff like /sarcasm, lol, wtf, and so on. They aren’t constructive, they don’t further people’s ability, and in no way to they help. They’re not even funny.</p>
<p>As I pointed out the other night to MybJames, I scrolled through most of his posts and they were one liners that were just flaming people. You shouldn’t join a community if you plan to be aggressive towards people. There are several of those tyrants going around the boards, and they’re the ones ultimately responsible.</p>

        <p>Whether it’s useful is always going to be an issue. There are thousands of regulars, and all will have varying views as to what is useful and what isn’t. It’s all relative to who you are, how laid back you are, and how much you know.</p>
<p>For example, lets say I posted a program I made in the Java section. Mopar, k00dr, Krichevskoy and pplsuqbawlz might see it as the most useless topic out.<br>
On the other hand, maybe it’s my first GUI program and I spent a while working on it and thought it could use some feedback.<br>
Commenting on things like that is fine, but as I said, people should keep it constructive.<br>
Someone saying “You suck noob” isn’t going to tell me ‘which’ part of my Java program isn’t that great. Nor will it teach me anything.<br>
Compare that comment to this one:<br>
“Hey Lothy - Your program is ok. But I think you could work on the GUI a bit, it looks a little messy. That, and…”<br>
See which type of ‘comment’ is helpful?</p>
<p>This forum isn’t an all adult forum. There are people at the age of 12 and younger, all the way up to people in their 20s. There may even be older people.<br>
It will never be spam free. That’s like expecting an entire group of year 7 students at a public school to have the complete and correct school uniform <em>every</em> single day. It’s just not going to happen.</p>
