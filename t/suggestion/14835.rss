              <p>Ah, I see. After one person tells them to post at moarscape, the rest of the posts are usually spam.</p>

Okay, I think that in order to help the amount of noobs posting moparscape/private server related things I think there should be a rule against helping them on this site. That way they have no choice but to goto the other site. If we tell them to go there for help then someone else helps them here then it kinda defeats the purpose.<br>

<p>They don’t read stickys. What makes you think they’ve read/will read the rules?[/quote]<br>
No see I was actually thinking more of the people helping them out not the noobs themselves. You know, noob posts “help me please with mopscape blah bleh blah i wantz to spawn items” and then someone says goto <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com/smf</a> then someone else posts saying what to do with moparscape and how to spawn items therefore defeating the purpose of telling them to go there in the first place.</p>
