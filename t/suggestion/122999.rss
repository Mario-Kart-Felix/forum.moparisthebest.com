    <description>Well, mod tharaok posted a thread about rep abuse in the 2nd page so that it is we can only rep a person  5-10 times in a month, but how about we make it so that people who have high rep like 100 dont give out 6 rep when they rep someone only 1 . for everyone it is 1 rep which will stop the abuse and people wont get as much rep.</description>

I personally like the current rep system. I belive it only gets abused in the Moparscape area…People get their friends to rep them. But as MastrCheif just pointed out its just a number and shouldn’t even be talked about. No need to continue to discuss it…<br>

<p>well repping 5-10 a month with 100 rep is the same as repping 40-50 times a month repping 1 each time -.- so your saying to take away the 5-10 times a month and replace it with 1 rep each time?</p>
