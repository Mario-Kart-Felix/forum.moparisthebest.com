    <description>Dear moparcrafters,

Now with 1.1 pvp at night is turned on. For a builder like me this is a not so good update. We are working on buildings with all our building materials with us and if suddenly someone appears he kills you and gets all your stuff. I haven&#39;t got this so far but well my suggestion is that there should be some special pvp zones where people can go fight and let the others build. I know this is probably not gonna happen but why don&#39;t give it a try?

thanks for reading,

Hmm, thanks for the idea. Will try it.</p>
