    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hbg-scape-v3-omfg-what-you-would-like-to-see/193135</link>
    <description>I am in the mood to go ahead and start creating my latest server, HBG Scape V3...

I decided to get a poll as to what you all would like to see in this next version of my line of servers...

Please vote and help me out.

Also if there is something that isn&#39;t lsited up there, let me know what it is when you post...

ALSO, Please tell me what server you would like best for me to use as a base server, or continue with the one im on (hiyascape base)

Please let me know :) Can&#39;t wait to release this for all of you!

HBGScape V2: (details of my V2)
Home is black knights hideout underground
It has jad at mage training area
Kq in her area
Veng works perfectly
Range only works close up
Mage works, but has timers that make pking difficult in it...
Teaming pk area is as mage bank
Solo pk is tzhaar area
Bandos is best armor
Obby mace is best weapon
Shops sell dragon, infinity, barrows, rares, bandos, obby maces, dragon weps, and pure items like zerker helms and neit helms...</description>

<p>I keep the training ones from attacking back because the point isnt to kill the narbs training <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>the ones that you kills for items do actually attack back…</p>
<p>I created jungle demon, he hits 50’s<br>
Skele hellhound - 70 max<br>
KQ i changed max to 70<br>
Jad i changed max to 50</p>
<p>Those are the 4 main ones to kill for items…</p>

<p>HBGScape V2: (details of my V2)<br>
Home is black knights hideout underground<br>
It has jad at mage training area<br>
Kq in her area<br>
Veng works perfectly<br>
Range only works close up<br>
Mage works, but has timers that make pking difficult in it…<br>
Teaming pk area is as mage bank<br>
Solo pk is tzhaar area<br>
Bandos is best armor<br>
Obby mace is best weapon<br>
Shops sell dragon, infinity, barrows, rares, bandos, obby maces, dragon weps, and pure items like zerker helms and neit helms…</p>
