good grief<br>
to start you off<br>
THERE IS NO TRADING IN 508s YET except for a selective few servers<br>
THERE IS NO SHOPS AT ALL except for maybe a few servers<br>
IF YOU CANT GET BANK OPENING WORKING JUST GIVE UP NOW<br>
LOCK PLEASE?<br>

You my friend are a COMPLETE IDIOT!<br>
I’ve been on many 508’s with trading methods and shops!<br>
gI have the trading method! Shops are just a mater of the handler! And Banking? YOUR A MORON! Thats the easiest thing you could do![/quote]<br>
wow take it easy on him, not many people are as skilled as you, and for banking go get pali’s 3.1 updated server, has banking and basic pvp etc.</p>
