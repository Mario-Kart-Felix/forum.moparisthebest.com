    <description>I think we should discuss this and come to a conclusion for the future, because I have already seen this be a problem not only in my old city, but also in others.

Here it is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If person A owns a plot of land, and allows person B to build on this land as a &#39;tenant&#39; of sorts, is person A allowed to kick person B out, and in the process destroy everything person B built?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here are my opinions:

[ul][li]First of all, person A&#39;s land should have to be clearly marked some how (say with a wall or something), OR person B&#39;s buildings should have to be within a certain radius.[/li]
[li]Secondly, I think person A needs to give person B X number of hours notice before destroying a building (thus giving person B time to move out), and if person A doesn&#39;t do this, destroying the house or whatever should be considered griefing [/li][/ul]


What do you guys think?</description>

              <p>Here’s the way I see it: if it’s my land and I give you permission to build on it, it’s still my land. What if you build a giant penis on my land and I want to remove it? Just saying that the owners will be dumb isn’t going to work - if the person doesn’t want the risk of having their property taken down, then they can just go build on another piece of land they don’t own.</p>

I think if people must have a rule for this, then that is exactly what we would have to do.  But not if we want a vanilla-like server.  As for me, I agree with Tom here, this is getting far too complicated and the rules are fine the way they are.[/quote]I wish it was, but there have recently been problems with it.</p>
<p>I don’t really want Towny, I just think everyone should come to an agreement. It doesn’t even need to be a rule, just something people all agree on.</p>
<p>The question is:<br>
If you own land, do you have the right to kick people out of it if you no longer want them there? If we can come to a consensus on this, then we wont need the mod, and we wont need any new rules.</p>
<p>I just didn’t know what to do in both cases that there were reports against people about this, and didn’t want to make any decisions without getting opinions.</p>

<p>Yes, because remove and bomb mean the same thing. You simply added to my argument in an attempt to counter it. removing is respectful and the people who do it know what they’re talking about. Whereas this server city owners are not so respectful and don’t know what they’re doing.</p>
<p>Like I said, a universal authority to handle these matters instead of allowing people with sufficient resources to grief. I can safely say this argument has now gone completely from the point.[/quote]How exactly do you expect this authority to make decisions, without having a set of rules to go by? Without rules, it’s completely down to the persons ideals as to who is punished and who isn’t.</p>
<p>Here’s what I see - We have a problem. It needs solving. It should be up to the community how we solve this problem. I think we agreed on the IRC now that we gotta stop this argument, so let’s get some new opinions in here.</p>

<p>How about we cut the looping around the griefing rule and make it simple. If you don’t like a persons presence then pvp is enabled, rid them (In city cases). For houses, if someone builds within the 10 blocks you can order them to leave.</p>
<p>But I don’t support one person having the power to grief someone and not get banned.<br>

<p>When you break the law, do the government bomb your house? <span class="bbcode-b">No</span> is the answer. Why? Because no one would stand for it. I suggest cities find another method for dealing with these people instead of attacking their hard work and assets.</p>
<p>You think this will do your city any favors? They’ll just come back and do more damage to your city and the server.<br>
[/quote]This is entirely different, first off, the government doesn’t ‘own’ the property that you live on.

<p>this and about building stuff the government doesnt want u to build does exist irl. <a href="http://www.theadvocates.org/blog/160" data-bbcode="true">http://www.theadvocates.org/blog/160</a> u may own ur land but if u dont get an ok to build stuff on the land u own u can be penalized. “You have a conflict between what you want to do with your land and what the zoning authorities permit” also if u live in a subdivision, u are subject to the rules they lay down and can be put in jail if u dont follow them. stupid yes since u own the property. but thats the law. i seen on tv this old guy went to jail for a couple days b/c his lawn wasnt picture perfect.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, because owners on this server are professional. They’d subject your property to griefing regardless if you did something wrong. I would only allow a universal authority to review me to be kicked out (Such as above).</p>

Welcome to Moparcraft, you can hire a lawyer to your left. This has gone from a simple rule to Davidi2 asking for proof he invites people to live on his property, contracts and government comparisons.</p>
<p>I’m going to setup a legal firm in the process, good job on killing the point of the game.<br>
[/quote]As I brought up, if you want to keep it simple, we can keep the current rule: you cannot build on anyone’s property without their permission. So I said that people could report others for griefing if they built on their property without permission. I think it’s pretty obvious that they would need proof that they had permission in order to see who is right and who is wrong. If you disagree… well… you don’t understand how we operate. In order to get someone banned for breaking a rule, you do need proof.</p>
<p>However, I’m not trying to get people banned for building in my city, because I DID invite them, but in the future, if people don’t need to show proof, they can just say ‘so-and-so let me build on their property, so it’s not griefing!’ and do whatever they want.[/quote]</p>
<p>Again, over complicating. Why must you create a hurdle just to play the game? Instead of settling for good old fashion methods of pvp (Which can be though on to review all issues with it).</p>

<p>Also, you brought in the point over government comparison, we just turned it against you.</p>
<p>But I do think that in the case of cities, we do need to do something (whether it be contracts or something else) to clearly define what is allowed and what isn’t, otherwise we are going to run into more problems.</p>

<p>If I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a thousand times I didn’t support what Frell was doing (one of the reasons I left), so don’t bother bringing it up.</p>
<p>Basically we need to decide - if someone builds on YOUR property, does what they build then become THEIR property? If yes, then people need contracts about where they build on other properties and such, and about destroying it. If no, then people should be able to destroy it, but with the points listed in the OP.</p>
<p>EDIT - I want to point out I don’t care which side happens, but there needs to be <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> clause added to the rules about this, or as it already has, it will be a problem.</p>

<p>Look, when accepting someone into a city you embrace a risk that they’re going to do wrong. I can argue it’s the owners responsibility to chose the right people. This just allows owners who are idiots to get people to build nice property then grief it.</p>
<p>I speak from experience, when I joined your empire I was threatened with removal because my buildings ‘didn’t look pretty on the outside’, this just goes to show what stupid reasons owners pull out in order to damage your hard work. You and I both know owners on this server will grief people regardless of their city rules, and I don’t like that.</p>
<p>I still see this as griefing and bannable.</p>

              <p>No, I don’t support any form of removing another persons property. If I was on someones land and they wanted to take down my property they’d have to fight me off first, I made it very clear when I was in your empire that I didn’t support this and wouldn’t stand for it at all.</p>
<p>Most places also lure people into thinking they’re mature, and then take buildings down for pathetic reasons like ‘they’re not pretty’. You then have personal grudges, this edit you want to implement will just make joining a group of people a ton harder and make people not want to join them anymore. As far as I’m concerned and city who supports this needs raiding, it’s just the stripping of rights and a loop hole in the griefing rule for those who have the resources to do it.</p>

              <p>I think we should discuss this and come to a conclusion for the future, because I have already seen this be a problem not only in my old city, but also in others.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>If person A owns a plot of land, and allows person B to build on this land as a 'tenant' of sorts, is person A allowed to kick person B out, and in the process destroy everything person B built?</blockquote>
<p>Here are my opinions:</p>
<p>[ul][li]First of all, person A’s land should have to be clearly marked some how (say with a wall or something), OR person B’s buildings should have to be within a certain radius.[/li]<br>
[li]Secondly, I think person A needs to give person B X number of hours notice before destroying a building (thus giving person B time to move out), and if person A doesn’t do this, destroying the house or whatever should be considered griefing [/li][/ul]</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>
