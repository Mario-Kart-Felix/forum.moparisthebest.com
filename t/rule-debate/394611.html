        <p>I think we should discuss this and come to a conclusion for the future, because I have already seen this be a problem not only in my old city, but also in others.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>If person A owns a plot of land, and allows person B to build on this land as a 'tenant' of sorts, is person A allowed to kick person B out, and in the process destroy everything person B built?</blockquote>
<p>Here are my opinions:</p>
<p>[ul][li]First of all, person A’s land should have to be clearly marked some how (say with a wall or something), OR person B’s buildings should have to be within a certain radius.[/li]<br>
[li]Secondly, I think person A needs to give person B X number of hours notice before destroying a building (thus giving person B time to move out), and if person A doesn’t do this, destroying the house or whatever should be considered griefing [/li][/ul]</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

        <p>No, I don’t support any form of removing another persons property. If I was on someones land and they wanted to take down my property they’d have to fight me off first, I made it very clear when I was in your empire that I didn’t support this and wouldn’t stand for it at all.</p>
<p>Most places also lure people into thinking they’re mature, and then take buildings down for pathetic reasons like ‘they’re not pretty’. You then have personal grudges, this edit you want to implement will just make joining a group of people a ton harder and make people not want to join them anymore. As far as I’m concerned and city who supports this needs raiding, it’s just the stripping of rights and a loop hole in the griefing rule for those who have the resources to do it.</p>

<p>Look, when accepting someone into a city you embrace a risk that they’re going to do wrong. I can argue it’s the owners responsibility to chose the right people. This just allows owners who are idiots to get people to build nice property then grief it.</p>
<p>I speak from experience, when I joined your empire I was threatened with removal because my buildings ‘didn’t look pretty on the outside’, this just goes to show what stupid reasons owners pull out in order to damage your hard work. You and I both know owners on this server will grief people regardless of their city rules, and I don’t like that.</p>
<p>I still see this as griefing and bannable.</p>

        <p>It <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> the owners responsibility, which is why I think the owner needs to go to more lengths to prevent it. Such as a [quote=“Davidi2, post:3, topic:394611”]thread-contract that people need to reply ‘yes’ to, to be allowed to move in![/quote]</p>
<p>If I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a thousand times I didn’t support what Frell was doing (one of the reasons I left), so don’t bother bringing it up.</p>
<p>Basically we need to decide - if someone builds on YOUR property, does what they build then become THEIR property? If yes, then people need contracts about where they build on other properties and such, and about destroying it. If no, then people should be able to destroy it, but with the points listed in the OP.</p>
<p>EDIT - I want to point out I don’t care which side happens, but there needs to be <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> clause added to the rules about this, or as it already has, it will be a problem.</p>

<p>[quote=“Tom_BETA, post:12, topic:394611”]Welcome to Moparcraft, you can hire a lawyer to your left. This has gone from a simple rule to Davidi2 asking for proof he invites people to live on his property, contracts and government comparisons.</p>
<p>I’m going to setup a legal firm in the process, good job on killing the point of the game.[/quote]As I brought up, if you want to keep it simple, we can keep the current rule: you cannot build on anyone’s property without their permission. So I said that people could report others for griefing if they built on their property without permission. I think it’s pretty obvious that they would need proof that they had permission in order to see who is right and who is wrong. If you disagree… well… you don’t understand how we operate. In order to get someone banned for breaking a rule, you do need proof.</p>
<p>However, I’m not trying to get people banned for building in my city, because I DID invite them, but in the future, if people don’t need to show proof, they can just say ‘so-and-so let me build on their property, so it’s not griefing!’ and do whatever they want.</p>
<p>Also, you brought in the point over government comparison, we just turned it against you.</p>
<p>But I do think that in the case of cities, we do need to do something (whether it be contracts or something else) to clearly define what is allowed and what isn’t, otherwise we are going to run into more problems.</p>

<p>Yes, because owners on this server are professional. They’d subject your property to griefing regardless if you did something wrong. I would only allow a universal authority to review me to be kicked out (Such as above).</p>

<p>Take and destroy are very different things. We’ve been discussing this on the IRC for a while now, and you’re just over complicating everything.<br>
[/quote]Either way, you lose whatever work you put into it.</p>
<p>[quote author=Tom_BETA link=topic=491797.msg3596396#msg3596396 date=1305135114]<br>
Welcome to Moparcraft, you can hire a lawyer to your left. This has gone from a simple rule to Davidi2 asking for proof he invites people to live on his property, contracts and government comparisons.</p>
<p>I’m going to setup a legal firm in the process, good job on killing the point of the game.<br>
[/quote]As I brought up, if you want to keep it simple, we can keep the current rule: you cannot build on anyone’s property without their permission. So I said that people could report others for griefing if they built on their property without permission. I think it’s pretty obvious that they would need proof that they had permission in order to see who is right and who is wrong. If you disagree… well… you don’t understand how we operate. In order to get someone banned for breaking a rule, you do need proof.</p>
<p>However, I’m not trying to get people banned for building in my city, because I DID invite them, but in the future, if people don’t need to show proof, they can just say ‘so-and-so let me build on their property, so it’s not griefing!’ and do whatever they want.[/quote]</p>
<p>Again, over complicating. Why must you create a hurdle just to play the game? Instead of settling for good old fashion methods of pvp (Which can be though on to review all issues with it).</p>

<p>i think since this is a community server we should just work together to build stuff, be respectful to others and stuff. if u want to pvp or want special mods then go play a different server. thats just my thoughts on the server.</p>

<p>Yes, because remove and bomb mean the same thing. You simply added to my argument in an attempt to counter it. removing is respectful and the people who do it know what they’re talking about. Whereas this server city owners are not so respectful and don’t know what they’re doing.</p>
<p>Like I said, a universal authority to handle these matters instead of allowing people with sufficient resources to grief. I can safely say this argument has now gone completely from the point.</p>

Without rules, it’s completely down to the persons ideals as to who is punished and who isn’t.</p>
<p>Here’s what I see - We have a problem. It needs solving. It should be up to the community how we solve this problem. I think we agreed on the IRC now that we gotta stop this argument, so let’s get some new opinions in here.</p>

<p>I think if people must have a rule for this, then that is exactly what we would have to do.  But not if we want a vanilla-like server.  As for me, I agree with Tom here, this is getting far too complicated and the rules are fine the way they are.</p>
