Sick of hearing all that bullshit? Too many noobs around here that require help, only for the MOST SIMPLEST error/code/java procedure?

Let&#39;s take action. I suggest you are not allowed to create a server without passing a Java/Server creating test, PERFECTLY, 100% unless you are community/senior/mod/admin member. The test should&#39;nt be able to be cheated on either.

If you are some stupid  wanna-be Java coder reading this and saying &quot;Oh, no way, haha. I&#39;ll just vote no.&quot;, then please don&#39;t vote at all. I&#39;m only looking for highly respected people that are pissed off at people posting in the wrong sections, or asking how to port forward, or asking how to set up No-IP/Hamachi.



The test should Include these factors:
1. How to set Up No-Ip/Hamachi (Sticky would tell you how to do so.)
2. How, and where to place voids/ints/booleans, etc.
3. How to post in the right section.
4. How to port forward.(sticky would tell you how to do so (www.portforward.com).).
5. How to start a Java applet/create one, how exceptions work, and other basic functions.



I also do not agree with the fact, that other people are able to host for you. People can scam your server, take it and host it as if they own it (eg. no Copyright on the original server), so much spam on forums, and different problems.

If you disagree, post. If you do aggree, poll.</description>
