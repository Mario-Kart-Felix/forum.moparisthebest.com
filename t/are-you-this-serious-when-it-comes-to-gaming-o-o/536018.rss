              <p>Although I don’t have physical anger… I believe it’s appropriate to show frustration when things are not going the way you visioned them. Think of any sport or game or competitive environment. I am a professional athlete and I came across this scenario when I beat the best in the world at our sport. He cussed and showed his frustration but I didn’t think low on the guy. I understood where he was coming from. Thousands of hours have been spent practicing, perfecting the sport (or in this case a video game) just to get ripped off or beat doesn’t feel good.</p>
<p>I believe if you don’t show any frustration when you fail at whatever it is that you’re doing in life, you shouldn’t be doing it. I have spent an equal amount of time actually watching my recordings from all the video games I play because thats the best way to learn. It’s like watching a instant replay and diagnosing what the fuck happened so that you’re prepared next time.</p>
<p>I take video games seriously because although I am having fun, it’s still time I am wasting. I expect results.</p>

<p>This isn’t pointless or funny he’s asking how serious someone is about gaming. It’s not as if the forums general discussion forum is absolutely thriving with 40 new threads a day, this is a fine place.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well I’ll agree with half of what you said- it isn’t funny… Anyways, there’s tons of discussion on the <span class="bbcode-i">video</span> thread, so I don’t know why it wouldn’t be the place for the <span class="bbcode-i">video</span>.</p>
<p>If you want to get even more technical, by your logic the thread should go in the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,145.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">general questions</a> forum, because it is apparently a legitimate question. I didn’t want to argue with anyone, I was just trying to let OP know there was already a <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,513601.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">topic for videos like these</a>…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Are you fudgeing kidding me? Who said I was getting technical? This is a fine place for a thread like this considering it had already sparked a couple comments which people could form some kind of discussion from. The rules are guidelines, this community isn’t ruled with an iron fist, if something like this brings a bit of action towards a board that could use a little more activity then so be it, there shouldn’t be an issue with that and if I was still a staff member I would’ve allowed it. I suggest you either comment on the video or report the post so a staff member can set this straight and take action on the thread.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to get heated I’m just pointing out to you that if a thread like this crops up every once in a while it isn’t an issue, if this board was filled with them then fire them all in one like was done in the past but it’s no unknown fact that this forum is on it’s way out, slowly but surely. A thread like this would be fine in this circumstance. Rather than correcting someone on a petty thing like this you should be contributing to the discussion and if you think this may be in the wrong board or should be merged with another thread then report it and let the staff take action. In a time like this where the forum is going down the shitter the community participating in threads like this makes it feel a bit more tightly knit and that’s never a bad thing.[/quote]</p>

This isn’t pointless or funny he’s asking how serious someone is about gaming. It’s not as if the forums general discussion forum is absolutely thriving with 40 new threads a day, this is a fine place.<br>

<p>Well I’ll agree with half of what you said- it isn’t funny… Anyways, there’s tons of discussion on the <span class="bbcode-i">video</span> thread, so I don’t know why it wouldn’t be the place for the <span class="bbcode-i">video</span>.</p>
<p>If you want to get even more technical, by your logic the thread should go in the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,145.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">general questions</a> forum, because it is apparently a legitimate question. I didn’t want to argue with anyone, I was just trying to let OP know there was already a <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,513601.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">topic for videos like these</a>…[/quote]</p>
<p>Are you fucking kidding me? Who said I was getting technical? This is a fine place for a thread like this considering it had already sparked a couple comments which people could form some kind of discussion from. The rules are guidelines, this community isn’t ruled with an iron fist, if something like this brings a bit of action towards a board that could use a little more activity then so be it, there shouldn’t be an issue with that and if I was still a staff member I would’ve allowed it. I suggest you either comment on the video or report the post so a staff member can set this straight and take action on the thread.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to get heated I’m just pointing out to you that if a thread like this crops up every once in a while it isn’t an issue, if this board was filled with them then fire them all in one like was done in the past but it’s no unknown fact that this forum is on it’s way out, slowly but surely. A thread like this would be fine in this circumstance. Rather than correcting someone on a petty thing like this you should be contributing to the discussion and if you think this may be in the wrong board or should be merged with another thread then report it and let the staff take action. In a time like this where the forum is going down the shitter the community participating in threads like this makes it feel a bit more tightly knit and that’s never a bad thing.</p>

Seeing as how youtube videos are now automatically embedded in the forum, I’ve taken early action to make sure we don’t get a surge of <span class="bbcode-u">pointless threads that just promote single funny videos</span>. This topic will basically be for any pointless but funny image or video you have<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"> NO NSFW</span></span></p>
<p>Just post funny stuff here, when people need to kill time they can go from page to page <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>In all seriousness I rage pretty hard. I reckon Pure and classic take the cake when it comes to raging at LoL like what these guys are doing. You should hear some of the Skype calls.</p>

              <p>there was once my brother and I were playing a ps2 wrestling game. We only had like one regular controller and then this steering wheel controller. I used the steering wheel one. Anyway, yeah he kept getting his ass kicked and stuff in the game and then I destroyed him with a chick versus like Undertaker LOL… yeah he got so mad he grabbed the steering wheel and beat the crap out of me with it haha. I literally had blood coming out of the top of my head.</p>
<p>Made my brother freak out and he threw me in the shower to help get rid of the blood cause he knew mom/dad was going to be home in like an hour. Was worth it.</p>
