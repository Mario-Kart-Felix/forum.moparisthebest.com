    <description>Hey guys I&#39;m just starting out with programming and I am using Hyperion. And I need someone to really teach me how all of it works. I&#39;ve been watching videos at udemy.com on the java course it&#39;s actually pretty useful but I need someone to teach me how it all works. My skype is josh.cougan.


Thanks,
Kingclawz.</description>

              <p>They are right. You can be taught the “code” but when it comes to comprehending it you are on your own. It is not something most, if not all, can just jump into overnight. Personally, it took me months to get used to programming in java. That being said, it was all still just basics and I had no idea on how to do anything complex. The only way to learn to program in private servers is to first understand the language. Then after you have that, you can look into the servers code, reading through it ALL, following the logic chain. Then if you have questions about how or why something works you can ask. There are quite a few elementary java tutorials on this forum.</p>
<p>Your first posts for releases on this forum will probably have a lot of criticism on them as well. (Typically basic programmers don’t have the means of writing pretty or efficient code)<br>
As you delve into the language as well you should start with the habit of DOCUMENTING your code. It is a bitch to change this habit once you started. (trust me)</p>

<p>This doesn’t go in server help.<br>
The question is to broad and not specific.</p>
<p>-OP-<br>
If you need help. Ask for help.<br>
You haven’t shown you need help because you apparently haven’t done any digging in the code, or online for tutorials, etc. We’re more than willing to help, but you need to be willing to help us help you.</p>

              <p>This might sound a little rude and I apologize but no one is going to go through the entire thing and teach you how it works. Play around with it and try and add basic things like skills, and whenever you see something in a class you don’t understand Google search it or post here.</p>
<p>If this is your first non-wL project then whatever you’re working on might not turn out to be that great, but you WILL get better.</p>
<p>Videos didn’t help me at all, but what did (and still does) really help me is asking questions, and reading the javadocs. Good luck <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
