    <description>I don&#39;t think this is much of a discussion but could lead to something, I have had this question for a long time for being so imaginative. 
What I was wondering is what if on Earth, each species of animals could talk to eachother. We just haven&#39;t found a way to communicate. It&#39;s probably not possible, but don&#39;t you think it would be interesting. Back to the god question, if god was real, would he make it so that we could not communicate with other animals but we still havent learned to break the communication block lol.
Or anotherr type of maml could be capable of learning a language, for example a monkey, but they haven&#39;t caught on yet. It sounds silly but think about it! If it turns out to be stupid then tell me and I&#39;ll delete it. It&#39;s just something that has been on my mind.</description>

<p>Are you saying they could become like humans in that aspect?

I’m not an expert in the department or anything all I know is the bark is intended for primal functions whereas our own voice that I know of at least is actually meant for communications similar to monkeys although of course ours is more advanced (of course theirs could be, I’m no monkey expert either).<br>

<p>Wasn’t comparing them to humans at all, simply answering the question. If other dogs lived here, they would eventually realize that when my dog makes that type of bark, the mailman comes. A learned behavior but it stops there. The dog was also bred as a watchdog so this may be normal for it’s breed.</p>
<p>Also, although my dog can’t talk back, he definitely understands many words. I don’t know if understand is the right word, but he certainly knows more commands/names of places/names of people than a small child would.[/quote]</p>
<p>To back you up on that, whenever I say a certain sentence to my dog, she immediately knows what I am talking about. For example,<br>
“want to go in the car” she sprints for the door and gets super excited. Or if your mad at here and tell her “go to your room” she will get a sad face and slowly start walking to her little cushion thing. Sometimes I started realising this and maybe if i said “go to your room” in the tone I would say if was saying “want to go in the car” maybe she would head for the door, but no she still understood the words. This goes with many other sentences aswell.<br>
(my dog is a poodle schnauzer mix.)</p>
<p>But cats… there dumb <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (i hate cats)</p>

Well once you learn pain and go “OWWWW” and start hearing noises, you will try to use it on others. Since humans are so smart we could do it again with no knowledge, it’s like how hellen keller or however you spell it said whaaahterrr with out knowing what she was saying or hearing. After that she wrote a book. That really shows how a human can learn without hearing/seeing. She learned herself from sign language basically. If humans learned to talk with noises like dolphons or something, don’t you think dolphons can eventually make there own noise language. They could be the humans of the sea :o</p>

<p>No, even if we revert to “ug ug”, we won’t be able to communicate with animals any more than at present. Just because (if we reverted) our languages use sounds, like animals’ languages do, that doesn’t mean we can communicate with them. I have never seen tigers talk to elephants.</p>
<p>Also, do you really think that our brain capacity hasn’t changed since caveman days and that we could devolve to talk using primitive sounds? The only real thing to cause that would be a mental virus pandemic which causes everyone’s speech memory to be wiped (all language forgotten) or for a complete wipeout of the human race except pre-speech babies.<br>

What virus would male us only forget languages lol, unless we had total amnesia were we forget everything we ever knew.<br>
In that case, we would learn again just as we did before![/quote]<br>
afaik there are viruses that affect certain parts of the brain, so why wouldn’t there be possibility for a virus to only affect the part of the brain which controls language? And we probably wouldn’t learn too easily - it’s taken thousands of years to develop our language, and if everyone in the world had forgotten what language was, and had no way of easily communicating (it’s hard enough to learn a language when you can talk about it, imagine creating one!) then it would take a long time.</p>

              <p>Through sounds, body language, and phermones is how animals communicate. Some of it is instinct or biological, and some of it is learned. We can pick up on this and communicate back already given you spend enough time with the animal.</p>
<p>I always like the way my dog has special barks. A distinct bark for the mail man. A distinct bark for dogs walking down the street. A distinct bark for when a guest is coming, and a distinct one for my mother. I can tell which scenario it is simply by his bark</p>

At the same time, I was also wondering why aren’t anything from other cartoons/movies being considered or tested?  Like ironman, it’s not impossible to make tiny rockets that have enough power to lift over 170 pounds and protect the legs from catching fire.  It’s merely an idea which may not be taken seriously for a while, but it still has potential.  Or even hovering skateboards!  I was wondering that when I was a kid, if engineers could make a strong enough fan to at least hold half a human, and make it small enough to fit under a board and cover half the board.</p>

Do you mean putting a human that doesn’t know english or how society works. Kind of introducing a cave men to the new world in the future in cartoons. Like putting a newborn and keeping it an environment that animals live in and as it grows up it learns to live with animals.<br>
lol im confused.</p>
