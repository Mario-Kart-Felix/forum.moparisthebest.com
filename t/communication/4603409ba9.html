<p>Are you saying they could become like humans in that aspect? Their phisiology is far too different (that I know off) for communications like our own and would most likely become extinct from external factors before they develope the ability. It’d take millions of years, many many many millions of years. I’m not an expert in the department or anything all I know is the bark is intended for primal functions whereas our own voice that I know of at least is actually meant for communications similar to monkeys although of course ours is more advanced (of course theirs could be, I’m no monkey expert either).<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Wasn’t comparing them to humans at all, simply answering the question. If other dogs lived here, they would eventually realize that when my dog makes that type of bark, the mailman comes. A learned behavior but it stops there. The dog was also bred as a watchdog so this may be normal for it’s breed.</p>
<p>Also, although my dog can’t talk back, he definitely understands many words. I don’t know if understand is the right word, but he certainly knows more commands/names of places/names of people than a small child would.[/quote]</p>
<p>To back you up on that, whenever I say a certain sentence to my dog, she immediately knows what I am talking about. For example,<br>
“want to go in the car” she sprints for the door and gets super excited. Or if your mad at here and tell her “go to your room” she will get a sad face and slowly start walking to her little cushion thing. Sometimes I started realising this and maybe if i said “go to your room” in the tone I would say if was saying “want to go in the car” maybe she would head for the door, but no she still understood the words. This goes with many other sentences aswell.<br>
(my dog is a poodle schnauzer mix.)</p>
