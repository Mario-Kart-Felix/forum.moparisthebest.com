Like ironman, it’s not impossible to make tiny rockets that have enough power to lift over 170 pounds and protect the legs from catching fire.  It’s merely an idea which may not be taken seriously for a while, but it still has potential.  Or even hovering skateboards!  I was wondering that when I was a kid, if engineers could make a strong enough fan to at least hold half a human, and make it small enough to fit under a board and cover half the board.</p>

        <p>As Niall and jme stated, we can communicate with animals through sounds, sign language, etc. This thread made me think of the movie ‘<span class="bbcode-i">UP</span>’ when the dog was speaking through his collar. When that movie was ‘released’ I was 10-11 and I always wandered if it was possible. I had a very vivid imagination as a child. Anyways, now that I think about it, I do believe it’s possible, then again, I don’t.</p>

        <p>Through sounds, body language, and phermones is how animals communicate. Some of it is instinct or biological, and some of it is learned. We can pick up on this and communicate back already given you spend enough time with the animal.</p>
<p>I always like the way my dog has special barks. A distinct bark for the mail man. A distinct bark for dogs walking down the street. A distinct bark for when a guest is coming, and a distinct one for my mother. I can tell which scenario it is simply by his bark</p>

No, even if we revert to “ug ug”, we won’t be able to communicate with animals any more than at present. Just because (if we reverted) our languages use sounds, like animals’ languages do, that doesn’t mean we can communicate with them. I have never seen tigers talk to elephants.</p>

afaik there are viruses that affect certain parts of the brain, so why wouldn’t there be possibility for a virus to only affect the part of the brain which controls language? And we probably wouldn’t learn too easily - it’s taken thousands of years to develop our language, and if everyone in the world had forgotten what language was, and had no way of easily communicating (it’s hard enough to learn a language when you can talk about it, imagine creating one!) then it would take a long time.</p>

Well once you learn pain and go “OWWWW” and start hearing noises, you will try to use it on others. Since humans are so smart we could do it again with no knowledge, it’s like how hellen keller or however you spell it said whaaahterrr with out knowing what she was saying or hearing. After that she wrote a book. That really shows how a human can learn without hearing/seeing. She learned herself from sign language basically. If humans learned to talk with noises like dolphons or something, don’t you think dolphons can eventually make there own noise language. They could be the humans of the sea :o</p>

Are you saying they could become like humans in that aspect? Their phisiology is far too different (that I know off) for communications like our own and would most likely become extinct from external factors before they develope the ability. It’d take millions of years, many many many millions of years. I’m not an expert in the department or anything all I know is the bark is intended for primal functions whereas our own voice that I know of at least is actually meant for communications similar to monkeys although of course ours is more advanced (of course theirs could be, I’m no monkey expert either).</p>

<p>Wasn’t comparing them to humans at all, simply answering the question. If other dogs lived here, they would eventually realize that when my dog makes that type of bark, the mailman comes. A learned behavior but it stops there. The dog was also bred as a watchdog so this may be normal for it’s breed.</p>
<p>Also, although my dog can’t talk back, he definitely understands many words. I don’t know if understand is the right word, but he certainly knows more commands/names of places/names of people than a small child would.</p>
