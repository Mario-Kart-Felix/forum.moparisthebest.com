    <title>Ghost, after-life, and supernatural forces</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ghost-after-life-and-supernatural-forces/470691</link>
    <description>I know there are a lot of topics on life-after-death and God, but I kinda wanted to give you my perspective on things and have you all explain your ideas.

Before I start, I would like to say that I am Catholic and I believe in God. I have just been thinking a lot about these topics lately and I am trying to come to some sort of conclusion to get it off my mind.

First off, Ghosts. Do you believe in them? I don&#39;t know if I do or not. They seem like they are something that could exist. In order to though, there would have to be some sort of supernatural forces (i.e God) because they are supernatural themselves.

What determines that you become a ghost? I have heard many stories about ghosts, some were nice and some were scary. I think that our lives on earth determine how we become ghosts and that someone above all of us is the judge of it. If we behave well and accomplish what we want to in life then we will get to go to &quot;heaven,&quot; if we die with sins on our back then we will be condemned to an after-life of being a ghost.

I am kinda rambling on now, so I will stop. Let me know what you all think. Wouldn&#39;t there have to be some supernatural forces for there to be ghosts? Are ghosts even real, or something created by us when we are scared? What determines that someone becomes a ghost?

Feel free to add any extra points.</description>
