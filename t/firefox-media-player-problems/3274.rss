    <title>Firefox Media Player Problems?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/firefox-media-player-problems/3274</link>
    <description>I just got a new computer about 2 days ago, and it has Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, and I just noticed that while trying to watch a streaming video with Firefox, that any of the videos that needed the Windows Media Player plugin didnt play. And when you try to find the missing plugin with Firefox, it says that it cant find one, then you get thrown for a loop when it just directs you back to microsoft&#39;s home page.

Anyways, I did a tiny bit of searching and found that you need 3 different DLL&#39;s associated with Firefox in order for it to play any windows media files on the net. Normally you would have to search and download each individual DLL, but I did that for you and put them in a zip ;)

So all you have to do is take the 3 DLL&#39;s included in the zip file, go to /Mozilla/Plugins and put them in that folder, then you shouldnt have anymore problems playing the videos.</description>

              <p>You will know if there not installed when you try to play a WMP and it tries to search for the plugin.</p>
<p>But also a good thing to check <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>first check if you already have these plugins <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>type about:plugins in the address bar and press enter.<br>
press ctrl+f and enter either:<br>
[<em>] npwmsdrm<br>
[</em>] npdrmv2<br>
[*] npdsplay<br>
if it doesnt show up you need to unzip these DLL’s <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>they should be grouped together!</p>

              <p>Hey thanks hdkilla!</p>
<p>I used to have so many problems with loading WMP movies on the internet with firefox. The movies only worked when I actually went to the .wma or .avi file, but otherwise firefox kept giving me an alert message saying that it couldn’t play it or something.</p>

<p>Edit: This should be in the tutorials section.</p>
