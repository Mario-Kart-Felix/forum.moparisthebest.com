    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-bought-a-vps-from-softsyshosting-how-do-i-use-it/544463</link>
    <description>I just bought a  VPS from softsyshosting.com/ and it has given me no information what-so-ever about the VPS. It has given me a receipt from the purchase, but no IP address, no information of the VPS, or any instructions on how to connect to it.

Can someone please help me out? I really just want to get on my VPS to start running my server.
