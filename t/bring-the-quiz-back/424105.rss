Personally I think the only people that should have an issue with whether or not to bring the quiz back is the moderators considering they’re the only ones that have to deal with the idiots that spam which isn’t a whole lot.</p>

              <p>[quote=“reyx7, post:70, topic:424105”]I like the essay w/ multiple choice questions. Just a short story (SAT style) telling users about moparscape. You must take it upon registration. There are 20 questions, you must get atleast 16 correct. The story could maybe explain the background and establishment of getting where we are.<br>
The quiz should also use large, complex words and terms. This would teach users to Google things. Hell, we could make an impossible question, and have the search bar special for when you’re taking the quiz so that it would only have that answer, which would teach importance of searching.<br>
Maybe throw in a grammar error or two, and have some questions on how it would be fixed. Overall, we just need a quiz that promotes intelligence within the community.[/quote]</p>

I actually wrote most of the questions in that quiz.</p>
<p>We didn’t want members who weren’t capable of finding out answers for themselves. They weren’t private server related either. Just general knowledge. The relevance? So new members would understand that while the information they required was around, it wasn’t going to be spoon fed to them. Also so they would get into the habit of searching for resources on their own.</p>
<p>You could say a google search is basically spoon-feeding anyway. However, it still required a bit of searching and thinking on their part. We didn’t want idiots making accounts one day and then leaving them inactive a few hours later. We were getting so many morons and so much inactivity at one point. The ‘quiz’ system actually improved things.</p>
<p>The whole idea of it is a bit outdated now though, so something new wouldn’t be a terrible idea. An interactive tutorial running users through the basics of what the community is about. The rules. Programming basics. Computer terms. Private servers. Even having it optional would still provide an improvement to our member base.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree with parts of this. The original idea didn’t work very effectively then, nor would it now. It’s easier to “mold” people after they join the community, rather than require only certain types of people joining from the get-go.</p>
<p>As for something new, I don’t see why it’s needed. What sort of problems have we experienced in the last few years that require this massive change? The general idea of the quiz isn’t selective. Almost every single member that posted in this topic and voted in the poll would immediately lose access to the website and have to take the new quiz themselves. Some of the suggestions in this topic require massive amounts of effort from the staff (none of which would likely want to devote that much time to something we consider inherently unneeded).</p>
<p>I am unconvinced due to the lack of reasons.[/quote]<br>
But, we still do need something because the increase of uneducated members asking FAQ is becoming disgusting.</p>

<p>This, I remember doing the quiz and having to google alot of them. When coming onto the site though, it didn’t change me in any way because theres a “help” section…</p>
<p>IDK TBH.</p>

              <p>I agree that the quiz should teach people the importance of searching. I’m sick of the 9 year olds who ask questions they could solve themselves with a simple <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a></p>
<p>The only time the “help” section should be used is if people can’t find the answer their looking for on google. :3</p>

Maybe throw in a grammar error or two, and have some questions on how it would be fixed. Overall, we just need a quiz that promotes intelligence within the community.[/quote]<br>

Or perhaps disregard the post count factor totally? There are many other viable options such as online time spent on the forum and an invite-only group of people who have the ability to approve the answers.<br>
[/quote]<br>
That works too, or how long you’ve been registered[/quote]<br>
Neither.<br>
Just have a button next before “IRC Chat” that says “Approve Quizzes” and you can vote whether to pass people or not pass people, and after a certain amount of people in the community approve/ decline he is either approved / declined.<br>
EDIT: It would be an advanced system, but it honestly seems fair and non biased were one person doesn’t have the whole decision.</p>

And this could also stop hackings from RATS on the server status, not completely, but might stop a good amount of them (Considering most are skids and won’t be able to answer the question)</p>
