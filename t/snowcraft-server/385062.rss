    <description>Non-Hamachi, high speed.

I hope to see you online!

[b]Basic Server Guide:[/b]

This is how the server works, I have plugins that stop TNT, creeper explosions, and fire from spreading. I have commands to rollback griefers and everything they did since the server started if they did something drastic, and I can tell who placed, as well as who deleted a block (Thanks BigBrother). [b]Griefing isn&#39;t bannable but it highly frowned upon and if your well known and I think you deserve it, bannable.[/b] So don&#39;t come whining if you didn&#39;t hide your chests or made your house out of wood. I want this to feel something like SSP and not some 10-year-old run server where the second you swear your muted. I&#39;m not going to babysit anyone. Though griefing of large beautiful pictures and/or statues is bannable first offence IF noticed by OP. Hide your house. Hide your chests. Hide your wife(s).

PVP Off
Monsters On

[b]Rules:[/b]

Griefing = Non-bannable but highly frowned upon (With the exception of beautiful pictures and statues if noticed by OP is bannable)
Heavy Griefing that OP&#39;s can highly notice without assistance of others = Bannable
Swearing is aloud (with moderation)
Spamming is bannable.
Racism or direct hits towards people in large quantities is bannable.
Begging OP&#39;s (of any kind/in any way) is warning, after 2 or more offences bannable.
Begging others is less bannable then begging OP&#39;s but you still can be banned.

[b]Commands:[/b]

/sethome
/home
/list
/who


[b]Other:[/b]

OP&#39;s/Admins have rights to enter your house at any time (invisible or not) without being questioned.

People who do good often  (Help others, rebuild griefing, help noobs) qualify to earn a title with colour and/or a reward. (Title something like &quot;Assistant&quot; &quot;Helper&quot; etc)
People who build massive beautiful statues qualify to earn a title with colour and/or a reward. (Title something like &quot;Builder&quot; &quot;Adv Builder&quot; &quot;Constructer&quot; etc)
Either one of these people may also be aloud to change there name (A nickname that goes over your real name)


[b]Server Stats (What the server is running on):[/b]

Windows 7 Pro 64-bit
8 GB Ram
GeForce GTX 470
1.5TB Hard Drive
AMD Phenom II X4 970 Overclocked to 3.8 GHZ

Connected directly to my high-speed router.




Now, what you&#39;ve all been waiting for:

<li>‘High speed router’ means nothing, the upload speed (and to some extent, your download speed, but upload is much more important) of your internet connection is what matters.  So how about you post that?</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck with your server. :)[/quote]<br>
1&gt; Completly correct<br>
2&gt; Not 100% correct, as an old 20GB hdd might fill up after a bit (i actually have an old 5GB (i think, cant read much on it anymore) HDD laying around<br>
3&gt; You will want a high speed router though, as dealing with a shitty one that only gives like 54mb/s (they never get near this from my experience), but it helps for the fact if someone is downloading off of another computer.</p>
<p>Sorry to argue, just felt like I would put in some points here</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Topic</span> - MITB is right though, you obviously need to do some research into what it takes to run a server. Greifing not bannable? That right there is asking for a 1-way ticket for everybody to hit disconnect.</p>
