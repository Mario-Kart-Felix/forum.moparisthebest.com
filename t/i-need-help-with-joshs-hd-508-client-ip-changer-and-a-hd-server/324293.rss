    <description>Ok well i download this server from moparscape server downloads:http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,416977.0.html and its a 508 hd server. So i downloaded the source and the client, then i opened the &quot;run&quot; file and once i open it says &quot;starting server on port: 43594&quot; so i thought that was alright, then i open the Josh&#39;s HD 508 Client Ip Changer client and run it. I typed in the ip &quot;0.0.0.0&quot; then pressed the enter key. I was thinking it was all fine and dandy. So once it was running it wasnt doing anything. So i looked at the source that was running and it said &quot;connection recieved from: 192.168.1.3&quot; it said that 4 times then it started saying &quot;currently 0 players online!&quot; and it has said that 14 times and is still saying it :eek:. So i looked at the &quot;run.bat&quot; that was open and it said &quot;error_game_js5io&quot;. So i don&#39;t know what to do with this, can  anybody help me? please :confused:
