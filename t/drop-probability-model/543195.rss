    <title>Drop Probability model</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/drop-probability-model/543195</link>
    <description>The issue at hand is this.
What could i use as a universal way to control the average, max, min drop rate?
The 3 colors in the middle are possible formula spreads. 
The only way i can think of is to have [i]n[/i] different &quot;drop models&quot; and specify an equation for each model.
to make it simple.
for [i]y = x[sup]2[/sup][/i](red line in picture)
The simple parts:
[i]y = A*(x-.5)[sup]2[/sup]+MIN[/i]
A is what i do not know. The value that would make val(0) and val(1) to be MAX. I guess what i am asking, is how would i go about finding a value for A, for any value MAX.(a generic equation)

I guess this would be a good thing to put in a quiz lol.
Okay- i may have been really dumb for this one i admit lol. 
A = (MAX-MIN)/(x-.5)[sup]2[/sup]| x = 0 or x = 1

Same question now: but doing it for a non uniform distribution.?
f(x = 0) = MIN and f(x = 1) = MAX for[b] anything but[/b] a [b]linear function[/b](green line)

What i end up with
example:
y = A * (x-.5)[sup]1/3[/sup]+ MIN
for max:
MAX = A * (1-.5)[sup]1/3[/sup]+ MIN
(MAX - MIN) = A*(0.5)[sup]1/3[/sup]
(MAX-MIN)/(0.5)[sup]1/3[/sup] = A

Ok last time.
Same question. but doing it for a multimodal distribution?</description>
