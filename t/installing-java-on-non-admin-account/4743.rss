    <description>Well, new job has been litterally killing me recently, hours, days - everything. I have been shipped from Kent to Hereford just to keep me working 7 days a week. Maybe aproaching the point i am due a good breakdown. Worst thing of all is it has been 6 months on a non-admoin account. 

I need entertainment. Help a desperate man please</description>

<p>No wai! I live in hereford, pretty much sucks here doesn’t it? Where do you work?</p>
<p>Anyway, back to your problem, look in the tutorials section, theres some tuts that tell you how to set up admin accounts etc so you can do that, install java and delete the account.</p>
