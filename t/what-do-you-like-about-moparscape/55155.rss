              <p>I enjoy moparscape as a rs pasttime. like if you just wanna have pking fun without the worries of losing your items and all the snobbish pures (not all pures are snobby) then pk servers are pretty fun. if i had to choose I’d pick rs due to the fact mre to due and servers don’t always crash :s… so yea I enjoy moparscape.</p>

              <p>I reckon MoparScape is a great Private Server. One thing I’m a bit annoyed about is that it is Hardly ever updated =P</p>
<p>Oh well, I guess it’s hard to run something like that.</p>
