    <title>The Basics of a server compiler</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-basics-of-a-server-compiler/334570</link>
    <description>[b]Difficulty: 0/10.[/b]
[i]This is more of a reference thread to general knowledge about compilers, however I will teach you how to make a basic generic java compiler.[/i]

[b]What is a compiler?[/b]
Contrary to popular belief java compilers are not only for Runescape Private Servers, they are used in all java programs. What a java compiler does is it &quot;updates&quot; all the .java/.class files in the folder. It can be found in a .bat or .exe format. However if you are using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse or Jcreator, compiling might not be needed. 

The first mistake a novice rsps programmer can make is assume that compilers and server starters are programmed in their own &quot;runescape private server language&quot;. Anyone with any experience in any programming language can probably make a compiler, and there are downloads to compilers all over the internet that will work for your server, however they might have not been made with the sole purpose of compiling a runescape emulator.

What really frustrates me is when people put so much effort into making a good, stable base but use an outdated compiler such as Mod Tahrok&#39;s compiler. Compilers like that have as much trash in them as a deltascape leech. Honestly, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who hates being redirected to www.java.com because my compiler could not recognize my environment variables. A common problem is also compilers look in the %Program Files% and forget about the %Program Files (x86)/(x64)/(x34)% which really discourages and frustrates someone thats new to building servers. 

Now on to the sleek, slim, working generic compiler.

Open up Notepad and save this file as compiler.bat, all file extensions.

[code=java]@echo off
@title Compiler
javac -cp . *.java
pause
exit[/code]

Explanation.
[code=java]@Echo off 
@title Compiler[/code]
Self explanatory, names the program, Compiler

[code=java]javac -cp *java[/code]
Javac refers to your version of Java, -cp is compile, and *java refers to all the .java extension files in your folder, thus &quot;updating&quot; all of them.

[code=java] 
pause
exit
[/code]
This makes certain the program does not randomly close, mandatory end for all .bat files.

I hope you found this guide helpful, and I hope people are not frustrated with themselves and automatically assume their environment variables are not in place when a compiler doesn&#39;t work.

[b]Thanks

              <p>Eh… Most of this is wrong. You have just failed to explain what a compiler is. The batch files we use are not compiler’s, there scripts to run a compiler. JDK comes with a compiler called javac which isn’t a batch file and it isn’t an exe, its a binary file.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>Javac refers to your version of Java, -cp is compile, and *java refers to all the .java extension files in your folder, thus “updating” all of them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>wrong…</p>
<p>javac doesn’t refer to the version of java. It refers the the file name of which the compiler is called. We add the location of the javac compiler to the path environmental variable and when we run the batch file it then searches through all the paths in the path environmental variable looking for the file named javac. -cp doesn’t mean compile it is a shorter phrase for -classpath. In the code which you gave as an example you do not need to have the -cp. -cp is used to find additional .class files in different locations. And you got the last part half right… The *.java is used to specify which files we are trying to find in the current or specified director. You also said thus updating them… Nope we don’t update the .java, it compiles them into .class files.</p>
<p>Re edit your post… It gives lots and lots of misleading and false information.</p>
