    <title>637 kill reward system</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/637-kill-reward-system/465929</link>
    <description>All I want to do is put in a system that adds coins to the inventory after a player kills another player. I think it should be something like if player is killed, then give x coins. the problem is I don&#39;t know what the exact code would be, or even the classes for them... Also where would I put it? I&#39;m a newb so please help  :)</description>
