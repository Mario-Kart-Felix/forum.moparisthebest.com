<p>Explain what part you’re stuck on so we may help you with it.</p>
<p>For example: “I don’t know how to make the key drop when only a deadman account kills someone” - and then you provide the related code for player killing (Ex: the death handling methods).</p>
<p>Your question as it stands is too ‘open ended’ (It’s basically just you asking for us to do everything). The most I’ll give you is steps you <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> take to add it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the key into the client. (models/defs/etc)</li>
<li>in the death handler, add in a check to make sure the player that <span class="bbcode-b">killed</span> the person was a deadman account (Assuming this is limited to deadman only). If true, drop X keys. If not, ignore and continue.</li>
<li>In your item-on-object handler (And first click object handler if the deposit box has the action), add code to check if the item used on the box was a key (for first click object - check if they have it). If false, stop it from opening. If true, open the depost box.[/quote]</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry for the late reply, I’m currently working on the bankraid part. I dont know how to make it where the player gives you a key where it holds their bank when you use it on a chest it opens up their bank with their most valuable 28 items. Ik how to add the bank key models and skull icons.</p>

<p>Actually, it’s probably not even worth your trouble adding this mode, because the step above is going to be your hardest task because how do you determine the ‘best’ items with no real system in place to monitor items.</p>
<p>Yeah sure you could base it on some little cfg price or shop prices, but have you actually ran a server because you’ll find players will never abide by these prices (meaning your ‘best’ items, will no longer be the ‘best’). For example, a party hat in the shop could be worth 5gp, but street value would be worth 500 million. How would you determine the best armour items? Stats/prices?</p>
<p>How would you account for price fluctuation?</p>
<p>If you want this mode done properly and not half-assed, it’s going to be quite a bit of work.</p>
