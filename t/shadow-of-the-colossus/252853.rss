    <title>Shadow of the Colossus</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shadow-of-the-colossus/252853</link>
    <description>I think it is the third best game I&#39;ve ever played, on the PS2. The entire thing is about a guy who travels to a forbidden land to save his true love. You need to kill 16 colossi. Each colossi is different and you need to attack a certain part of their bodies to kill them. Each boss is like a puzzle, you need to figure out how to get to his vitals. The boss fight is furthest from God of War, none of the bosses get killed if you hurt them anywhere else.

That was the first boss.
I give it 43/43
Have you played it? What did you think? What was your favourite boss? Give it a rating.</description>
