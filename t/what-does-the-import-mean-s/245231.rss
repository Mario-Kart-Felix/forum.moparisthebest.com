    <title>What does the import mean? :S</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-does-the-import-mean-s/245231</link>
    <description>Well, I have coded my server throughly but recently just started thinking about this. Inside most of my java files, always at the beginning of course, I just really looked at things like:

[code]import java.util.ArrayList;[/code]

or

[code]import java.io;[/code]

What exactly is this importing? java libraries?

I just started thinking about this for some reason, and I am probably going to need it making a new class. Any help? Nooby Question, I know, but oh well.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Jordiescape, post:2, topic:245231”]It imports classes from the main Java files that come from Java, here is a helpful overview that will become a friend =D.<br>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Overview of some classes</a>[/quote]The import keyword is not limited to classes in the prepackaged API by Sun; as it can be used to import your own packages within your own program or library.</p>
<p>The <span class="bbcode-i">import</span> keyword corresponds with the <span class="bbcode-i">package</span> keyword. This is how it works (I’ll show you an example and then explain):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">package com.telenubby.rs2;

class ConnectionThrottler
{
       public ConnectionThrottler()
       {
              //Ignore - as this is only an example.
       }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <span class="bbcode-i">package</span> keywords places a class into the specified package. Packages are based on the folder/setup your class is placed in. For example, if my class was located in the file …/org/runescape/cheating then I would use the package keyword like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">package org.runescape.cheating;</code></pre>
<p>Generally, the first sub-name in the package name would be something very general, such as: org, com, net, gov, info. ‘Com’ would represent a commercial program, and ‘net’ would represent something related to networking. The second sub-name usually involves something to do with the creator(s) of the program, and the third usually involes something to do with the program itself (e.g. general field or related topic).</p>
<p>The <span class="bbcode-i">import</span> keyword is used like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">import java.io.*:</code></pre>
<p>What this does is import <span class="bbcode-b">ALL</span> classes (because of the character ‘*’) in the <a href="http://java.io" rel="nofollow noopener">java.io</a> package (which would be in the folder …/java/io/). The Java compiler automatically includes a path to Sun’s prepackaged API in the classpath, which means its there for you to use and you dont have to worry about setting it up. This also limits you from creating classes in these predefined packages.</p>
<p>Another example would be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">import com.telenubby.rs2.ConnectionThrottler;</code></pre>
<p>Instead of importing all classes for your use in the package provided, you are only importing the class named ConnectionThrottler. This way, you can import indivual classes rather than entire packages. I perfer this over the first option I mentioned, as it helps you learn what you are using.</p>
<p>As Jordiescape said, a list of the packages Sun has prepackaged for you can be found <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a> or on your local harddrive.</p>
<p>Good luck. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
