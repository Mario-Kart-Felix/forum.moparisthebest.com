              <p><code>if(command.equalsIgnoreCase("dice")) {
        int dice = (misc.random(100));
        yell(""+playerName+" has just rolled @red@"+dice+" @bla@on their percentile dice!");
        plrText = "I rolled a "+dice+" on my percentile dice!";
    }</code></p>
<p>This is the code you add to your client just search “if(command” and add you command to the bottom</p>
