    <title>New compiler =D *hassle free*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-compiler-d-hassle-free/417403</link>
    <description>This compiler is better than mod allstars for the main point that it uses DIR to get the name of your java, rather than having it listed (1.6.0_22 i think is the one he has written in it) this does not require any editing at all. 

catches
It does require permission to write to the folder it is in(i think this is always allowed though), so it can create a file with the directories in it. It will auto delete its self so it doesn&#39;t waste any space. 

warning--
make sure your backup directory is not within your current directory(or a sub dir) or it will go through and compile all of those too &gt;.&gt;

perks(positives)--
This supports 32 bit and 64 bit processors (x86).
It reads from folders that even have spaces in them(though i did not check if it read java files with spaces in their names, but i don&#39;t think you can even have them so...)
It compiles file by file so it outputs how many errors there are in each file.
It will search all sub-directories and the main directory for the .java files to compile.
it doesn&#39;t require environmental variables(i know because i removed mine to test it =])


side notes--
i must say it is really not hard to learn at all and just takes a little patience. I did a lot of &quot;googleing&quot; to figure out how to do many things but the applications i used them in were 100% my own.
in total took me like 7 hours to write the whole thing and get it to work =\ i did a lot of echoing to figure outwhere my errors were and why they werent working. my main problem fixing was spaces in folder names &gt;_&lt;! that took me forever to come up with my OWN solution, i couldn&#39;t find that answer, but i did get some &quot;hints&quot; like it had to do with tokens, and i was only reading the first one. so i just made it combine all of them as one and then do it =] because not all files would have the same amount of tokens this was my only option. turns out my solution was &quot;tokens=*&quot;..... simple, i know right?

for color--
both variables are hex (0-F) if you want the colors either use trial and error, or google them
i will tell you now that (0-8) are darker colors and 9-F are lighter colors. (F is white, 0 is black)

credits 100% to me

granted, it may look really similar to mod allstar&#39;s but when coding in a batch file, there is not much room to be unique.

key differences- mine is MUCH shorter. mine doesn&#39;t require editing for some people to get it to work. ( i hope!)


if you have any errors with it please tell me O_o i will (TRY) to fix them.</description>
