    <title>Choosing a source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/choosing-a-source/334092</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;ve been working on a private server for a bit now and haven&#39;t really found a source that works for me. I&#39;m looking for a 508 source that is somewhat similar to the Devolution source. I got a 508 version of Devolution but when I ::pickup items with an ID &gt; 10000 I get null. I can&#39;t really tell you what my criteria is beyond that, if you could just throw some names of sources or some links, that would be greatly appreciated.</description>
