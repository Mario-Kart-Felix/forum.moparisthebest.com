<p>Do you really think (moparscape) community input would help?[/quote]</p>
<p>no but it will give them practice with out method of packet handling, and the aryan scripting i put in it. maybe just maybe they will learn a few things.</p>

Last I heard, she had tested the packet handling stuff in the current ‘servers’ and it worked. So that would mean the problem was either in the walk handling, or in the update block (I’ll put my money on the update block) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I don’t know how she’s going, because she isn’t on IRC. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> But if she found the problem, then it should be near ready to release.</p>
