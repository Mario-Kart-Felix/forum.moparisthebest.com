    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/almost-got-fooled/387625</link>
    <description>Yea so the other day i got an email saying my RS account was banned for RWT and i thought thats weird i havent been on it for a while.


Today i got another saying &quot;Confirm Email Address change&quot;

So i clicked the link and canceled it. But then i noticed the address was not a secure address,

website for Email address change

http://secure.runiescapee.com/m=email-register/loginform.php?ssl=216&amp;login=1039238995

And for the Ban:

http://appeal.runescaye.com/loginform.php?mod=www&amp;ssl=4&amp;&amp;dest=title.ws

[size=14pt][b]DO NOT ENTER YOUR EMAIL/LOGIN AS THESE ARE FAKE.[/b][/size]


The Email to me were done very professionally and i didnt suspect them until i saw the website URL.

how hard is it to read the messages all over jagex products you know the ones that say “JAGEX WILL NEVER CONTACT YOU VIA EMAIL OR INGAME ABOUT ACCOUNT RELATED INFOMRATION, JAGEX WILL ONLY USE THE MESSAGE SYSTEM”?

<p>This. Ever since their change to registering emails an what not, they do contact you via email now. Mostly for email based settings, they wont email you if you receive a ban or something.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten these also, but opendns does a very good job of completely blocking them if Google Chrome doesn’t give me a warning first. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
