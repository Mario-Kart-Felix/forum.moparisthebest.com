    <description>[center][b] - Setting up Scar - [/b][/center]



[u][b] - - - - - Make sure you have downloaded the include Files - - - - - [/b][/u]
These are commands which scripters have written to help other scripters make their script easier, and if you dont have one of the includes, error messages will come up and your script wont start.

[code]Include file C:\...\SCAR 2.03\includes\SRL.txt does not exist.
Failed when compiling[/code]


[ul][*]To get all of the include files, Hit &#39;File&#39; and then &#39;Download Includes&#39; in Scar and follow the instructions to download the includes.
[*]If that doesn&#39;t work, visit this link:  http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,425.0.html[/ul]



[hr]


[u][b] - - - - - Turning off Silent Mouse - - - - - [/b][/u]
Silent mouse was originally used in RSC so that you could auto and do other things on the computer at the same time.  Unfortunately, Jagex caught on and so now Silent mouse has to be turned off for you to be able to auto.  This means your mouse will be controlled by scar and you wont be able to do anything else whilst the script is running.
Silent Mouse is off by default, but you should check just in case.
In Scar, hit &#39;Tools&#39; and make sure the first option &#39;Silent Mouse&#39; is [b]Unticked[/b]


[hr]



[u][b] - - - - - Dragging crosshair onto the Runescape Window - - - - - [/b][/u]
This is so Scar knows the boundaries of the RuneScape screen so that you can auto properly.

[ul][*]Drag this symbol : [img]http://img372.imageshack.us/img372/8978/crosshair2if.jpg[/img] : onto the runescape screen.
[*][b]You must drag the symbol every time you open up scar, or change world![/b]
[*]A huge box will appear around the Selected Client and shrink to fit it.  A new message will appear on the debug box saying:[/ul]
[code]&#39;User specified a new RS window&#39;[/code]
[ul][*]If the message comes up, but the box doesn&#39;t, drag the crosshair again and repeat until the message and shrinking box both appear.[/ul]



[hr]


[u][b] - - - - - Picking Colors - - - - - [/b][/u]
This is so scar knows what colors to click and what colors to look for in RuneScape, so the script functions properly.  This is a very important step and must be done properly.  [b]You must do it yourself, because each time you log onto runescape, the colors change slightly.  No one else can do this for you.  If you change worlds, you muct repick all of the colors asked for.[/b]  There are 2 ways in which a script will tell you which colors to pick.


[u] - - - &#39;Const&#39; Colors - - - [/u]

[code]
banksymbol = 5825779;   //Green part of $ sign
yewtree = 1282831;      //middle of yew tree on minimap
roadcolor = 5921634;    //road color on minimap
[/code]

Under the word &#39;Const&#39; in the script is a list of all the colors you need to pick.  The writing to the right of the numbers (e.g &#39;//middle of yew tree on minimap&#39;) describes what color you need to pick.
To pick the color asked for, login to runescape, and go next to the color which the script asks you for.  
]With both Scar and Runescape visible, click this Symbol in Scar : [img]http://img480.imageshack.us/img480/5489/colorpicker6en.jpg[/img] : and your screen will freeze.
Click the color asked for and a new message wil appear in the debug box:

[code]Color Picked: 16777215 at (214, 203)[/code]

The numbers will always be different, so dont worry if you didn&#39;t get the same numbers as me.
Copy the [b]long[/b] number using Ctrl + c and paste it [b]over[/b] the existing color under &#39;Const&#39;.
Repeat this for all the colors asked for and you will setup all of the colors.
An example of the colors setup after selecting all of the colors would be

[code]
banksymbol = 3047422;   //Green part of $ sign
yewtree = 16777215;      //middle of yew tree on minimap
roadcolor = 262913;    //road color on minimap
[/code]

[b]Remember, the above are just examples![/b]



[u] - - - &#39;Form&#39; Colors - - - [/u]

This is an example of a form asking for colors.

[img]http://img480.imageshack.us/img480/1940/colorpicking6xu.jpg[/img]

It works in basically the same way as the &#39;Const&#39; colors, except you have to type in the colors asked for since you can&#39;t copy and paste.  The other different is you wont be able to select the color picking tool, you will have to press the shortcut [b]Ctrl + Alt + P[/b] to activate it.  Fill in the form and the colors will be saved.


[hr]



[u][b] - - - - - Other Setup - - - - - [/b][/u]
Other setup is required so that the script knows what to do incase something &#39;irregular&#39; happens, such as you log out by accident, you get a lamp for a genie, you are attacked etc.

[code]
TheLampskill = &#39;prayer&#39;;//Skill to use lamp on if found
RunDirection = &#39;N&#39;;     //Direction to run away in
UsingTiera = True;      //Are you using a Tiera?
esslimit = 1000;        //Number of Essence you have in bank
[/code]

The different types of options you have to setup are as follows:

[ul][*]String - This is a word which you type in.  The word [b]Must[/b] be surrounded by quote marks (&#39; &#39;)
[*]Boolean - This means &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;  No quote marks here
[*]Integer - This is a number.  again no quote marks.[/ul]

Again the writing to the right informs you about what you have to set.
The first one in my example is the skill to use the lamp on if youfind one in your inventory.  Type in the skill you want to use lamps on.
Next is the run direction you want to run away in if you are being attacked.  Type in &#39;N&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;S&#39; or &#39;W&#39;
This comes from my air crafter script, and so you have to tell the script if you are wearing a tiera or using a tally.  If you are wearing one, type in true and if not, type in false.
The Ess limit is how much essence you have in your bank.  Type in the number of essence you have so the script knows when to stop.
An example of my setup:

[code]
TheLampskill = &#39;Mining&#39;;//Skill to use lamp on if found
RunDirection = &#39;E&#39;;     //Direction to run away in
UsingTiera = False;      //Are you using a Tiera?
esslimit = 587;        //Number of Essence you have in bank
[/code]

This could again be written in a form, but thats easy to fill in and its basically the same thing as above.
Note - Scar Scripts cannot stela your Username or Password, so it is OK to fill it out into a script.  Just make sure you delete it before sending the script to anyone!
[b]Make sure you fill out any other setup the script asks for, like standing in a specific place, having something in your invenotry etc.[/b]


[hr]



[u][b] - - - - - Starting, Stopping and Pausing the Script - - - - - [/b][/u]
This is so the script can run and stop when you tell it to.
Make sure scar is completely setup by following the instructions above.

[ul][*]Hit the green arrow the run the script
[*]Hit the Yellow / Orange double lines to pause the script
[*]Hit the Red square to stop the script[/ul]


Alternatively, use these shortcut keys:

[ul][*]Start: Ctrl + Alt + R
[*]Pause: Ctrl + Alt + A - Note, to start the script again after pausing, hit the shortcut for &#39;Start&#39;
[*]Stop: Ctrl + Alt + S[/ul]


[hr]

And thats it!  Thats everything you need to setup SCAR.  If you need anymore help, just ask.  If you need more visual help, check out my Flash guide which is attached to this post

Hope that Helps

<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"> - - - - - Make sure you have downloaded the include Files - - - - - </span></span><br>
These are commands which scripters have written to help other scripters make their script easier, and if you dont have one of the includes, error messages will come up and your script wont start.</p>
<p><code>Include file C:\...\SCAR 2.03\includes\SRL.txt does not exist.
Failed when compiling</code></p>
<p>[ul][<em>]To get all of the include files, Hit ‘File’ and then ‘Download Includes’ in Scar and follow the instructions to download the includes.<br>
[</em>]If that doesn’t work, visit this link:  <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,425.0.html%5B/ul%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,425.0.html[/ul]</a></p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"> - - - - - Turning off Silent Mouse - - - - - </span></span><br>
Silent mouse was originally used in RSC so that you could auto and do other things on the computer at the same time.  Unfortunately, Jagex caught on and so now Silent mouse has to be turned off for you to be able to auto.  This means your mouse will be controlled by scar and you wont be able to do anything else whilst the script is running.<br>
Silent Mouse is off by default, but you should check just in case.<br>
In Scar, hit ‘Tools’ and make sure the first option ‘Silent Mouse’ is <span class="bbcode-b">Unticked</span></p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"> - - - - - Dragging crosshair onto the Runescape Window - - - - - </span></span><br>
This is so Scar knows the boundaries of the RuneScape screen so that you can auto properly.</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]Drag this symbol : <img src="http://img372.imageshack.us/img372/8978/crosshair2if.jpg" alt width="" height=""> : onto the runescape screen.<br>
[</em>]<span class="bbcode-b">You must drag the symbol every time you open up scar, or change world!</span><br>
[*]A huge box will appear around the Selected Client and shrink to fit it.  A new message will appear on the debug box saying:[/ul]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">'User specified a new RS window'</code></pre>
<p>[ul][*]If the message comes up, but the box doesn’t, drag the crosshair again and repeat until the message and shrinking box both appear.[/ul]</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"> - - - - - Picking Colors - - - - - </span></span><br>
This is so scar knows what colors to click and what colors to look for in RuneScape, so the script functions properly.  This is a very important step and must be done properly.  <span class="bbcode-b">You must do it yourself, because each time you log onto runescape, the colors change slightly.  No one else can do this for you.  If you change worlds, you muct repick all of the colors asked for.</span>  There are 2 ways in which a script will tell you which colors to pick.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"> - - - ‘Const’ Colors - - - </span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">banksymbol = 5825779;   //Green part of $ sign
yewtree = 1282831;      //middle of yew tree on minimap
roadcolor = 5921634;    //road color on minimap</code></pre>
<p>Under the word ‘Const’ in the script is a list of all the colors you need to pick.  The writing to the right of the numbers (e.g ‘//middle of yew tree on minimap’) describes what color you need to pick.<br>
To pick the color asked for, login to runescape, and go next to the color which the script asks you for.<br>
]With both Scar and Runescape visible, click this Symbol in Scar : <img src="http://img480.imageshack.us/img480/5489/colorpicker6en.jpg" alt width="" height=""> : and your screen will freeze.<br>
Click the color asked for and a new message wil appear in the debug box:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Color Picked: 16777215 at (214, 203)</code></pre>
<p>The numbers will always be different, so dont worry if you didn’t get the same numbers as me.<br>
Copy the <span class="bbcode-b">long</span> number using Ctrl + c and paste it <span class="bbcode-b">over</span> the existing color under ‘Const’.<br>
Repeat this for all the colors asked for and you will setup all of the colors.<br>
An example of the colors setup after selecting all of the colors would be</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">banksymbol = 3047422;   //Green part of $ sign
yewtree = 16777215;      //middle of yew tree on minimap
roadcolor = 262913;    //road color on minimap</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Remember, the above are just examples!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"> - - - ‘Form’ Colors - - - </span></p>
<p>This is an example of a form asking for colors.</p>
<p><img src="http://img480.imageshack.us/img480/1940/colorpicking6xu.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>It works in basically the same way as the ‘Const’ colors, except you have to type in the colors asked for since you can’t copy and paste.  The other different is you wont be able to select the color picking tool, you will have to press the shortcut <span class="bbcode-b">Ctrl + Alt + P</span> to activate it.  Fill in the form and the colors will be saved.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"> - - - - - Other Setup - - - - - </span></span><br>
Other setup is required so that the script knows what to do incase something ‘irregular’ happens, such as you log out by accident, you get a lamp for a genie, you are attacked etc.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">TheLampskill = 'prayer';//Skill to use lamp on if found
RunDirection = 'N';     //Direction to run away in
UsingTiera = True;      //Are you using a Tiera?
esslimit = 1000;        //Number of Essence you have in bank</code></pre>
<p>The different types of options you have to setup are as follows:</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]String - This is a word which you type in.  The word <span class="bbcode-b">Must</span> be surrounded by quote marks (’ ')<br>
[</em>]Boolean - This means ‘true’ or ‘false’  No quote marks here<br>
[*]Integer - This is a number.  again no quote marks.[/ul]</p>
<p>Again the writing to the right informs you about what you have to set.<br>
The first one in my example is the skill to use the lamp on if youfind one in your inventory.  Type in the skill you want to use lamps on.<br>
Next is the run direction you want to run away in if you are being attacked.  Type in ‘N’, ‘E’, ‘S’ or ‘W’<br>
This comes from my air crafter script, and so you have to tell the script if you are wearing a tiera or using a tally.  If you are wearing one, type in true and if not, type in false.<br>
The Ess limit is how much essence you have in your bank.  Type in the number of essence you have so the script knows when to stop.<br>
An example of my setup:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">TheLampskill = 'Mining';//Skill to use lamp on if found
RunDirection = 'E';     //Direction to run away in
UsingTiera = False;      //Are you using a Tiera?
esslimit = 587;        //Number of Essence you have in bank</code></pre>
<p>This could again be written in a form, but thats easy to fill in and its basically the same thing as above.<br>
Note - Scar Scripts cannot stela your Username or Password, so it is OK to fill it out into a script.  Just make sure you delete it before sending the script to anyone!<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Make sure you fill out any other setup the script asks for, like standing in a specific place, having something in your invenotry etc.</span></p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"> - - - - - Starting, Stopping and Pausing the Script - - - - - </span></span><br>
This is so the script can run and stop when you tell it to.<br>
Make sure scar is completely setup by following the instructions above.</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]Hit the green arrow the run the script<br>
[</em>]Hit the Yellow / Orange double lines to pause the script<br>
[*]Hit the Red square to stop the script[/ul]</p>
<p>Alternatively, use these shortcut keys:</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]Start: Ctrl + Alt + R<br>
[</em>]Pause: Ctrl + Alt + A - Note, to start the script again after pausing, hit the shortcut for ‘Start’<br>
[*]Stop: Ctrl + Alt + S[/ul]</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>And thats it!  Thats everything you need to setup SCAR.  If you need anymore help, just ask.  If you need more visual help, check out my Flash guide which is attached to this post</p>
<p>Hope that Helps</p>
