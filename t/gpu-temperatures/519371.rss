    <description>Are the following idle temperatures bad/decent/good?

I finally got my new case and swapped every piece over, which was a pain in the butt since it was my first time doing it; however, it was really fun.</description>

The performance is still “okay”, but yes, it does definitely bottleneck, and to a point that you can actually notice.</p>

<p>I am more than informed on the definition of Ignorance. Lin doesn’t know what hes fu<span class="bbcode-b"></span>cking talking about. He likes to assume. He is not informed on the research someone might of done before posting here, which he claims everyone hasn’t done.</p>

The point isn’t about using Google itself, although I’m quite possible of looking up information via a search engine, as I’m sure quite a large group of people can do the same. I did not post here to get someone to “do my work”, because I mentioned I did research beforehand to find a reasonable temperature to base my opinions off of. I posted this, with a question in mind, to see what other people in this community thought.</p>
<p>I understand where you are coming from, as I’m sure everyone else does to. There are different groups of people in the community that determine the types of questions to asked, whether they are simplistic or advanced questions. The rules of this section determined that my question would meet the requirements of this board, so I posted it. I assure you that I would not post something that is extremely simple.</p>

Maybe you’re an older member, but that doesn’t give you the reason to act like an ignorant prick. If you’re tired of people “asking before googling,” go find another board or a whole new hobby entirely.
