<p>Guys, you have to think, not everything you are told is correct. Alot of science things are just (clever, and most probably correct) guesses. Nobody knows the size of the universe, or what an atom looks like. We can’t tell how many universes there are, or how it started/will end. These things are currently impossible to truly know.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hmmm… That is true. Here’s something to think about; we’re constantly asking questions about the universe, how it was made, what it’s here for, what was before it, the formation of stars, etc. And, apparently, we’re all supposedly made of stars, yes? (Link here about that: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080201000521AAGAe4E" rel="nofollow noopener">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080201000521AAGAe4E</a>)</p>
<p>So really, if we’re made out of stars, and there’s all these questions about how the universe came about and such, then why don’t we all know automatically know already how the universe was formed? Are all of these questions just us questioning ourselves?<br>
[/quote] Alot of people say we’re made from ‘stars’ for a few reasons, some ones that I believe are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our sun, was formed from an even larger star, which ‘exploded’. I’m unsure of the next bit, but somehow, the planets were also formed here, making humans made from stars</li>
<li>Not really stars, but another is: Earth started with NO life whatsoever. At some point a foreign space object crashed into earth, with living bacteria on it. this then went through evolution…blah blah…and made us. This theory also supports the argument of ‘aliens’ or life out of earth.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>plausable, i like this theory, can produce any evidence?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Here is what i believe:<br>
A big star exploded and all the pieces scattered everywhere (this was known as the big bang). All the pieces became round because of its own gravity. The larger masses have larger gravity so therefore it pulled the smaller masses towards it and some of the smaller masses started orbiting the larger ones because of the slingshot effect, and thats why planets have moons and thats how our solar system was made. THE END <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
[/quote] That’s quite good. Only thing I can question about this is, where did the big star come from to start this all off?<br>
(I like to ask questions, It extends my knowledge, makes me think, and can really piss somebody off if used correctly :P)[/quote]<br>
your basically asking what happened before the big bang, well, even scientists dont know that yet… lol. The big bang theory its self has anomalies so… ya, thats why scientist are trying to come up with a unified physics (Einstein was working on unified phyiscs before he died). Unified physics will be able to explain how the universe work and how anything and everything works.</p>

<p>Theory time!<br>
We could be hydrogen based, as some scientists believe that the ‘big bang’ gave off the very first element, hydrogen. these had gravity, so they pulled together, until there were GIGANTIC amounts of it, which made it so heavy, they fused together, to make helium. And so on to make other elements etc.</p>
<p>NOTE: Hydrogen is No. 1 in the periodic table, Helium being number 2.[/quote]<br>
duh hydrogen having the smallest atomic mass with 1 electron. and elements don’t" “fuse” they react you correct scientific terminology.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: 27-09-2009, 18:51:10[/size][hr][quote=“Jamie1200, post:69, topic:303780”][quote author=h4x0r88 link=topic=400064.msg2970754#msg2970754 date=1253936040]<br>

We’re made of carbon gives me the impression that were made entiry of carbon, which it looks like, If want to agrue about we can, I’m up for a scientfic argument, There is a difference when it comes to science.</p>

Theory time!<br>
We could be hydrogen based, as some scientists believe that the ‘big bang’ gave off the very first element, hydrogen. these had gravity, so they pulled together, until there were GIGANTIC amounts of it, which made it so heavy, they fused together, to make helium. And so on to make other elements etc.</p>
<p>NOTE: Hydrogen is No. 1 in the periodic table, Helium being number 2.</p>

</aside>
<p>Here is what i believe:<br>
A big star exploded and all the pieces scattered everywhere (this was known as the big bang). All the pieces became round because of its own gravity. The larger masses have larger gravity so therefore it pulled the smaller masses towards it and some of the smaller masses started orbiting the larger ones because of the slingshot effect, and thats why planets have moons and thats how our solar system was made. THE END :)[/quote] That’s quite good. Only thing I can question about this is, where did the big star come from to start this all off?<br>
(I like to ask questions, It extends my knowledge, makes me think, and can really piss somebody off if used correctly :P)</p>
