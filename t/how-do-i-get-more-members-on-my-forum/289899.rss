    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-get-more-members-on-my-forum/289899</link>
    <description>I have no members on my forums and I&#39;ve got the link in my siggy and haven&#39;t gained one member, how do I get people to join my forums? And if you join my forums, please don&#39;t ask to be staff. But that&#39;s not my point, I just want to know how to get more web traffic to my forums and I want to know how to get more members without paying to advertise and stuff.</description>

I agree with what your a saying, but moparscape doesn’t really have a unique feature that other runescape development sites have does it?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, it’s interesting how this site started. I don’t think moparscape was ever intended to be so large.</p>
<h2>Before <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> and before <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, we were at kaitnieks forums which was the main/best runescape cheating forum. And the main focus was developing bots to cheat, but a private server was eventually made. Kaitnieks had a daughter with his girlfriend and had to close down his website because he had more important things. Everyone basically flocked to <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, which was pretty much a clone of the kaitnieks forums at the time. Because private servers weren’t that huge yet, they were just discussed on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>. Us alone made the forum probably have several thousand members(majority inactive). Pretty much out of nowhere this giant whole new community of people joined looking for moparscape, and we had to seperate the website into <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> and I guess it’s just become “the” private server forum. Then other websites started to spring up, but we were the original private server website. <span class="bbcode-b">The moparscape client was created a long time ago, and it was probably the nicest one available at the time.</span>
</h2>
<p>Anyways, make some threads on your forum. Make some topics about games you like or whatever. Maybe people will join just to answer you.[/quote]</p>
<p>It still is the nicest one available, although Silabsoft is catching up, the original moparscape 317 is a very good client, if only it was open sourced.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/r0ckstar96">@r0ckstar96</a></p>
<p>I have had many forums, some popular and so that just fail terrible. There are numerous ways you can make your forum hit high traffic, for instance, sign up at a top100 gaming site, ask you friends to be active and to vote often, make something unique as stated before or just base it off your private server. I have seen many forums get popular, a lot of members and posts daily because of the private server they are creating, for instance Dynasty, the forums where popular after a few days of posting.</p>
<p>Well, you can try google for any other additional information, these are just some basic tips to get you started I hope you can get a way of having a popular forums. Good luck.</p>

              <p>Just the fact that Moparscape is already big and was one of the first communities for this sort of thing.

<p>-Ask friends to join<br>
-Sign up with xtremetop100 and get your friends to vote<br>
-Buy a better domain<br>
-Advertise elsewhere</p>
<p>There are many things you can do, but chances are you will go nowhere without spending a little bit of money.</p>

<p>That could be a good idea too. But advertising is great and all, but more traffic doesn’t always mean more members. you still need to convince them to join. And his site doesn’t have much too convincing for me. Not trying to be an ass.</p>

              <p>I have no members on my forums and I’ve got the link in my siggy and haven’t gained one member, how do I get people to join my forums? And if you join my forums, please don’t ask to be staff. But that’s not my point, I just want to know how to get more web traffic to my forums and I want to know how to get more members without paying to advertise and stuff.</p>
