        <p>I understand your forums are gaming-based, correct?</p>
<p>What do you have that is unique to offer, that other well-established game forums don’t have? Why would someone want to join this new site with no content, when they can join a reputable gaming community such as filefront or the IGN forums.</p>
<p>Lets pretend for a second that you do not own this website. If you saw some random member here on moparscape, and in their signiture they advertised “Join TODAY! Life of the Gamer TOTAL PWNAGE!” and you decide to check it out. You don’t even know this person, and you see their forum has no members or activity. Would you join it? If not, what do they need to convince yourself to join?</p>
<p>Next I should mention, smfforfree. It’s hard to take any website owner seriously when they can’t invest some time or money into setting up a real forum with a real host. But buying a domain and getting a proper host, isn’t going to make your website successful alone.</p>
<p>Basically:<br>
-You’re website has nothing unique. Nothing creative. Everything your forums has to offer, can be found at other gaming sites + more<br>
-You’re website has no member-base, which is detering others from joining.<br>
-You’re using a joke of a host. And a very annoying domain name.</p>
<p>So I am sorry to say, but you’re website isn’t going to succeed like this.</p>

<p>That could be a good idea too. But advertising is great and all, but more traffic doesn’t always mean more members. you still need to convince them to join. And his site doesn’t have much too convincing for me. Not trying to be an ass.</p>

        <p>I agree with jme. Your forums doesn’t have many things to offer. I can easily find those boards on other sites, even cheat code sites don’t have categories, but they do offer those topics to talk about. The domain is also a throwoff.</p>
<p>-Ask friends to join<br>
-Sign up with xtremetop100 and get your friends to vote<br>
-Buy a better domain<br>
-Advertise elsewhere</p>
<p>There are many things you can do, but chances are you will go nowhere without spending a little bit of money.</p>

        <p>Just the fact that Moparscape is already big and was one of the first communities for this sort of thing. That alone allows Moparscape to be popular, because it has now spread everywhere and has been around for a long time. With lots of content and members already joined. Things are successful when they are unique.</p>

<p>Well, it’s interesting how this site started. I don’t think moparscape was ever intended to be so large.</p>
<h2>Before <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/">moparisthebest.com</a> and before <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/">moparisthebest.com</a>, we were at kaitnieks forums which was the main/best runescape cheating forum. And the main focus was developing bots to cheat, but a private server was eventually made. Kaitnieks had a daughter with his girlfriend and had to close down his website because he had more important things. Everyone basically flocked to <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/">moparisthebest.com</a>, which was pretty much a clone of the kaitnieks forums at the time. Because private servers weren’t that huge yet, they were just discussed on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/">moparisthebest.com</a>. Us alone made the forum probably have several thousand members(majority inactive). Pretty much out of nowhere this giant whole new community of people joined looking for moparscape, and we had to seperate the website into <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> and I guess it’s just become “the” private server forum. Then other websites started to spring up, but we were the original private server website. The moparscape client was created a long time ago, and it was probably the nicest one available at the time.</h2>
<p>Anyways, make some threads on your forum. Make some topics about games you like or whatever. Maybe people will join just to answer you.</p>

<p>It still is the nicest one available, although Silabsoft is catching up, the original moparscape 317 is a very good client, if only it was open sourced.</p>

<p>I have had many forums, some popular and so that just fail terrible. There are numerous ways you can make your forum hit high traffic, for instance, sign up at a top100 gaming site, ask you friends to be active and to vote often, make something unique as stated before or just base it off your private server. I have seen many forums get popular, a lot of members and posts daily because of the private server they are creating, for instance Dynasty, the forums where popular after a few days of posting.</p>
<p>Well, you can try google for any other additional information, these are just some basic tips to get you started I hope you can get a way of having a popular forums. Good luck.</p>
