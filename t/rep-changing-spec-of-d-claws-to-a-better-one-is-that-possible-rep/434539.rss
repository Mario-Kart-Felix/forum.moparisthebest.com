    <description>hey riipiinftw i got a question for you.. how do i chaange the dragon claws spec .. cuz every know that know claws spec fail in every 317 pi server who use erasedpkz or insidiaX or pvp.. or whatever... what im askin is.. is it possible to change the spec claws to a better one .. do u remenber dragonscape 525«? i would love to have the same spec.. a powerful spec 

i found sumthing..! the spec is doing 50% of the damage to make another one.. like if i hit 30 its going to be
      
             30
         7.5  7.5
             15

sumthing like this how do i change that?

case 14484:
			c.gfx0(1950);
			c.startAnimation(10961);
			c.specAccuracy = 10.0;
			c.clawDamage = 0;
			
            if (c.playerIndex &gt; 0) {
            	Client o = (Client) Server.playerHandler.players[c.playerIndex];
            	if (Misc.random(calculateMeleeAttack()) &gt; Misc.random(o.getCombat().calculateMeleeDefence())) {
            		c.clawDamage = Misc.random(calculateMeleeMaxHit() + Misc.random(2));
            	}
            	c.clawIndex = c.playerIndex;
            	c.clawType = 1;
            } else if (c.npcIndex &gt; 0) {
            	NPC n = Server.npcHandler.npcs[c.npcIndex];
            	if (Misc.random(calculateMeleeAttack()) &gt; Misc.random(n.defence)) {
            		c.clawDamage = Misc.random(calculateMeleeMaxHit() + Misc.random(2));
            	}
            	c.clawIndex = c.npcIndex;
            	c.clawType = 2;
            }
			
			c.doubleHit = true;
			c.usingClaws = true;
			c.specEffect = 5;
			c.hitDelay = getHitDelay(c.getItems().getItemName(c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon]).toLowerCase());

</aside>
<p>Well I’m not sure about Delta. The only experiance I have is with Pi but their will be a method that’s to do with the damage a weapon does. Like in the OPs post I’m assuming <code>clawDamage</code> is to do with damage output so I’d mess around with the number following it to see what happens.<br>
For hosting it for people to play etc it’s not a big deal but if you want to get better you should try n avoid things like that if you can. But meh :P.</p>

</aside>
<p>You shouldn’t do that, it’s ineffeciant. Theirs already a switch statement (or something, cba looking at the code), just modify it. If I remember correctly in Pi’s at least their are damage and accuracy modifiers. So if you wanted the damage 2x you’d type in 2.0 which means their would be double damage lol, same with accuracy. I haven’t touched a server in ages so you’ll have to look around, I’m pretty sure it’s in the combatassistant class</p>
