    <title>Good god, help with NPC spawning</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-god-help-with-npc-spawning/107972</link>
    <description>Ok, This is the third time I have posted this with no luck.

I would like to know if it is possible to delete a spawned NPC. Basically a variation of newNPC void, but it deletes a certain NPC.</description>
