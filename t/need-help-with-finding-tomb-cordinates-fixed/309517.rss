    <title>Need help with finding tomb cordinates [FIXED]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-finding-tomb-cordinates-fixed/309517</link>
    <description>I&#39;m working on adding the Barrows to my server - the actual one that is on RS. It&#39;s coming along fine. However, I have the coordinate for the underground maze with the chest, but I can&#39;t find the coordinates for the tombs themselves?

Note: I am using a 317. 

I just need the coordinates for one tomb. Then I can figure out the rest.

Or is it height level? Since the tombs are below ground...

For future refernece:</p>
<p>HeightLevel: -1<br>
X: 3554<br>

<p>(That will put you in Dharok’s tomb. Play around with the tele command to go to other ones. Just gotta go up and down the x and y axis a few squares.)</p>

              <p>I think it’s height. On Deltascape, I dig on the mound, but nothing happens. Instead, the ghosts of the brothers are on on top of the mound. So I guess digging won’t work. Odd.</p>

              <p>I’m not going to bother to look for you, find it out yourself by downloading DeltaScape teleporting to the Barrows mini-game use the shovel and put coordinates on, you’ll find it easily then, also I think the height is the same as normal but I’m not sure.</p>
