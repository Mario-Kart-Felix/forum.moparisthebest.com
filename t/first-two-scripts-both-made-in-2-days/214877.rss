    <title>First Two Scripts (Both Made In 2 Days)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/first-two-scripts-both-made-in-2-days/214877</link>
    <description>Hello,

     I&#39;ve been gone for awhile, and came back to the community and playing RuneScape and I realize that making money, is becoming a more and more hassling task, with more and more ways of making money fast slipping away. Well, I am happy to say that I found an ok method of making 38gp profit per unit, and the unit takes 2 clicks.

     The method I&#39;m speaking of is Vials. I read on Fagex that a new way of making money is to buy restore potions at 44gp each, empty them, and fill them with water, and sell them for 82gp each, essentially making 38gp profit. I investing 400k into the method, and upon completing 3 loads of just emptying them, I found the task quite fucking boring.

     The time I&#39;ve spent in this community, I&#39;ve never scripted a full scar script, but I tweetered around with the program, finding other uses for it. But, I felt that I finally had enough knowledge to produce a fairly capable script, but of course nothing perfect.

For the first script, I set it up so your in the Grand Exchange, on the east bank, bottom booth, it will continuously take out restore potions (or whatever is in your 2nd bank item slot, empty them, and then put them in your bank and take out more. I would not trust to leave this script for more than 5 minutes, as I in the past two days have emptied 9090 vials and have only been able to leave it alone for about 25 loads before something went awry. If you are going to use this I hope you understand that you will have to change the coordinates for the bankers, or just edit it for another location (it would probably be easier). It comes with a small Progress Report, and if you want it to work fully you need to edit the code yourself. Remember to start the script with 28 restore potions (any dose) in your inventory. Also, upon looking at the script you may realize that my development time would have probably decreased in half the time if I had used the clickallitems command from srl to empty them. If anyone bothers to look in the Scar help forum, you&#39;ll see that I did and went along anyways. I plan on switching to this method later.

My second script I finished in about 20 minutes after all of my vials were emptied. This script starts out in varrock east bank, with 28 empty vials in your inventory and takes you to the closest fountain. After waiting for it to fill the vials it takes you back to the bank where it banks and goes back on another trip. The progress report is a bit more advanced, and even uses a constant to tell you how many trips and vials you need to go. I would trust this script to be left alone for maybe 15, 20 minutes at most. The most I&#39;ve seen it go awry was when SRL screwed up and it didn&#39;t withdraw the vials and went to the fountain for nothing, but come back and got set back on track.

Please remember that while developing both of this scripts, I was pretty high, and that I hope they work as well for you as they did for me. In the future I think I will add better progress reports to both of them, anti-randoms and anti-bans, and maybe merge them both into one script. I also plan to change the location of the first script, or even make it changeable. Please tell me what you think.
