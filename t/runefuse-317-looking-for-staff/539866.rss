Our objective when starting this new server is an attempt at express our own desires in gaming and allow others to do the same. We may be new but we are here to stay for the long run and hope to see more unique players to come and join our diverse community. We welcome you to this new and modest server! 

Jump into the fun NOW at: [url=http://runefuse.com]runefuse.com[/url]

We have a wide variety of mini-games that are fully functioning and are there for you and your friends!

What really makes us unique is that we have a specific store related to points you accumulate throughout your activities in the server. Killing and skilling all provide tender that can be used to redeem these goods. We also feature the elemental whip which holds untold powers..(the purple one). We also offer a large asortement of other costum goods through the server.
