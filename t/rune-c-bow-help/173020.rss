    <title>Rune C Bow help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rune-c-bow-help/173020</link>
    <description>Ok, I made rune c bow hit like a cross bow. When I attack npcs with it, I hit pretty high. ( 30s-40s ). But, when I attack players with it, My max is only like 20? I searched if(usebow) in client.java, and changed hitdiff to 50, but after i compile and turn on the server, every other range item can hit up to 50 too. I only want rune c bow to hit up to 50. Any Help?</description>
