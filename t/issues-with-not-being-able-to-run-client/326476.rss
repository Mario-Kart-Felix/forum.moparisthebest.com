    <title>Issues with not being able to run client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/issues-with-not-being-able-to-run-client/326476</link>
    <description>Hello, I am trying to run the CaliScape Client V.4.0, I click &quot;Start Server&quot; and it says &#39;Java&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.   I tried taking a run.batch from a client that does work but for some reason it will still not run it.

I put this 

@echo off
cd files
Start javaw -Xmx500m -cp .;Theme.jar Gui
exit

But it does not work, it says &#39;Gui&#39; is not found.

Help is needed, please help thank you.</description>
