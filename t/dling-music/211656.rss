    <title>DLing music</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dling-music/211656</link>
    <description>MY friend had just sent me 2.9 gigs of songs and I downloaded them fine, put them in iTunes, and tried to sync them on to my iPod. Thing is, these exclamation points appeared next to the songs and it said they couldn&#39;t be transferred to the iPod because they couldn&#39;t be found, although the folder holding all 2.9 gigs of the songs is sitting right here on my desktop. 

Help?</description>

              <p>^^ Did that, then realized I had to have the folders open so my computer would be able to locate the file.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
