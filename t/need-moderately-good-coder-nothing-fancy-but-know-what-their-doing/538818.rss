    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-moderately-good-coder-nothing-fancy-but-know-what-their-doing/538818</link>
    <description>My Co-Owner and I have started a 317 pushing 508 pretty cool source and client but we are looking to make it really detailed on what we are adding! We have coded everything so far but need someone with a little more experience to help us out with coding! We would like you to join us in the venture to a successful server but we need to find the right qualified person! I will be putting a application below for anyone who wants to try out to fill out and the Co-owner and I will pick who best fits us. Thanks and Hope to see you on board!!
