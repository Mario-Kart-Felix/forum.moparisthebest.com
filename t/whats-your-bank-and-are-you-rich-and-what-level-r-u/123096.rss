best items: ever that i had? 2 santas and a blue mask with that 63m cash <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> this was when i was doing awesome at staking before i got cleaned.<br>

<p>Ill give you an idea:</p>
<p>When i quit a year ago, i had about 76m cash, and about 27m in items, i kept the 27m in items and gave the 76m cash to a friend, as he was close to getting his first red phat, he said if i ever come back he would give me all the money back.</p>
<p>So i came back, he now has a green and a white phat and is slowly merchanting his phats to get my money back (i told him not to sell them, i said get it when you can) but he can make upto 10m profit on a phat each time.</p>
<p>But while i have been waiting i have earned all that cash back, and am still waiting on 46m off him (hes on a 2 week holiday) he has payed me 30m so far.<br>
So i have earned all the cash i already had back and he still owes me 46m, oh and 36m in items, about that anyway lol.</p>
<p>I will let you add it all up, but in no way, EVER i will release a bank picture, if i do then i will block out the money because so people dont say things like “AWW COMON GIVE ME 6M TO ROUND YOUR MONEY OFF”…[/quote]</p>
<p>so if he pays you back you will have around 160m?</p>
