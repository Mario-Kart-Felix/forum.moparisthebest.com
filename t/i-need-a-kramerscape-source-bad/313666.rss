    <title>I NEED a KramerScape Source bad</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-kramerscape-source-bad/313666</link>
    <description>Listen, I know this is wrong section and I don&#39;t know where else I could place this... Although, I gaurentee that some of you oldscool players of private servers like me remember the old Moparscape - enter your IP days instead of clients and such.. And I GAURANTEE that atleast one person on these forums has played KramerScape. I love it so much, and I want to bring it back. If ANYONE can find me a KramerScape source I&#39;ll Sh*it myself, anyways I heard he sold he source to a few people and It could be running around. For the sake of the greatest server I&#39;ve ever played, please find it for me. I&#39;ve been searching since last monday and cannot find it. I WILL BRING BACK THIS SERVER.

&lt;3 you guys
