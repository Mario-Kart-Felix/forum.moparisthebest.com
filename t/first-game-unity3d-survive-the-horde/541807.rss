    <description>[b]So basically, I am creating my first game in Unity3d. It is your usually zombie survival game. I might release it when I finish, but it&#39;s nothing special since its my first game. I am using the FPS_Tutorial Kit,  but I am adding more scripts . All the models I use atm are just place holders until I finish working on new models. [/b]

Things to be implemented later
-AI Zombies
-Collectible Weapons

-Collectible Food for Health
-Cabins with Loot
-Main Village (Better Loot but More Zombies)
- Timer to count how long you survive
-Reloading Animation

-MORE TO COME!
[/code]

          <blockquote>
              <p>I would center the gun a little more, and bring it in a little closer. It looks like it’s kind of just floating out there. From the looks of it, it’s semi-automatic, if not, bigger than a pistol and would most likely require two hands. With it that far to the right, it looks like you’re just holding a semi-automatic machine gun with one hand, which isn’t the easiest thing in the world. Or at least have another hand coming from the left side and linking up with the gun. If you go to Google Images and type in “FPS” you can see that most other FPS’ demonstrate this.</p>
<p>Other than that, this looks really cool and interesting. Hoping to see some progress coming soon!</p>
<p>Edit - More suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the Health and Ammo text/bars smaller, possibly create a small GUI around them, as suggested earlier. I think a smaller and more detailed health bar across the top would be nice, and have the ammo in smaller characters in the top-left of the screen. Keep the bottom open if you want to add an inventory, buttons to throw grenades, etc.</li>
</ul>
