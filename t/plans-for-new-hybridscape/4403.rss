    <description>well everyproject needs plans and the new one is going to be no different we where able to complete the old plans but now its time to take it a step futher. obiously more work on the gui sense that was the big hit with hybridscape but after writing the chat server i decided we finally gotta take the big plunge and centralise the server community. will start with a centralised loginserver. but after we write that we need some php skills because we would need a place for server owners to manage user accounts in the central server database. ill go into more detail later as i work some things out. :p</description>

              <p>frank_ gave me an awesome idea from his rsc client recently, when the new hybridscape comes out a new moparscape will come out as well, its main feature being that you can start a private server from a button in the client, so people wanting to just try it wont need a server ip or to download a server to do so <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>unfortunatly I think we have went too far in the rs2 server development to ever have a centralized login server now, that is unless one small group of people wanted to run it, but it will never be a big thing for everyone I dont think <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>one other thing that would be great would be a jaggrab server running with the private server so that that could hold and distribute the cache files to the client, just like the real runescape</p>
