    <description>hello a couple of days ago i posted this &quot;hello my server is testscape and when i spawn items like fury ammy d2h d axe infi and items like that my server chrashes i&#39;ve downloaded fearscape to see if that would allow me to spawn those items but it also chrashes plz help &quot; i got this reply

&quot;You&#39;re server base probably does not yet recognize these items. Most items after 6000, are not coded into most serverbases. with the except of some barrows and onyx items. If these items are not in your server base and you try to equip/use/spawn them it can crash and corrupt your account in which you&#39;ll have to individually go in 

/characters and click your file and find the item in your inventory or equip roster, and remove it to access your account again. it&#39;s the same as ::pnpc for NPC graphics that don&#39;t yet exist or have been added into a server base. if you do a corrupt ::pnpc code by yourself out of everyone&#39;s site, it only crashes you, if you do it in any area where people can see you, it crashes them as well.&quot; 

i am woundering if someone could help me &quot;code these items onto my serverbase&quot;[br][size=1]Posted on: February 22, 2007, 07:35:28 PM[/size][hr]such as fury d2h infin and as much items past &quot;6000&quot;</description>

              <p>Yes I posted that to you, Although I am unsure how to remedy the problem, I do know that it is usually caused by Item.cfg and item1.java. Please search for a tutorial first, before running recklessly into both files for a solution. Item1.java has the rosters which indicate which peice of clothing or weaponry or jewelry goes where, whereas item.cfg dictates what each individual item’s properties are.</p>
