    <title>Neopet account recovery help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/neopet-account-recovery-help/263321</link>
    <description>Hey guys I was wondering if anyone could help me with a problem

a long time ago I made the account reserectionofnewguy on neopets just so I could code some neopet game autos in scar and I loast interest after a while and quit working with it and since then unsubscribed from neopets mailing list, now I would like the account back to give to my young nephew because the account is loaded which brings me to my problem - they wont email me the password because im on their &quot;don&#39;t email&quot; me list, any suggestions on what I can do? I was thinking it would be great if I could get the hash for my account and locally bruteforce it but I don&#39;t know if its possible to get it 

and yea my first account newguy45 was banned for autoing so hence reserectionofnewguy lol</description>
