<p>[2] In umm texthandler.java</p>
<p>[3] They are objects, search for “makeglobalobject”</p>
<p>[4] It is possible, but no tuts are for this. This is something you would have to learn on your own.</p>
<p>[5] Get the gfxs, models of them. npcs, and make godwars outta them. I’m sure theirs a tut on that.</p>
<p>[6] FUCK, This is on the tip of my toungh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p>[7] Ummm, It’s something to do with adding rights to it in client.java, I don’t remember been 2 long.</p>
<p>[8] These would be interfaces you add to the client from downloading them.</p>

[4] (almost) impossible to do, because you’ll need to have a .java file that’s compiled for 518 (where construction IS possible) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
