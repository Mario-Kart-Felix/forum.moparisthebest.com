The last 4 showing the whole quest was takin a couple days ago we updated it a bit more but thats the most update i could get for now will get more pics later/

Update&#39;s After Original Post:
Removed the guild portals and shit, I&#39;m gonna focus on making ONLY the actual guilds in the game work with the doors working (Ranged Guild, Cook&#39;s Guild, Champion&#39;s Guild, etc).

Redid Barrows, you now dig on the mounds of dirt and enter the correct Barrow Brother&#39;s tomb where the Brother is located at and there is a portal near the entrance that takes you to the chest underground, and a portal at the chest to return you to the top ground.

Redid all Teleports on each spellbook;

Normal Spellbook: Each town teleport (varrock, ardougne, etc) go to their respective towns, there is an Amulet of Glory teleport that leads to Edgeville, Al Kharid, Karamja, Draynor and the Trollheim teleport leads to Trollheim.

Ancient Spellbook: Each of the Ancient Magicks teleports lead to their correct and respective locations, whether it be to Canfis or deep bloody Wilderness.

Lunar Spellbook: Lunars Altar (Home), Barbarian Assault (MiniGames), Barrows (Monsters), Catherby (Catherby), Mage&#39;s Bank (PK), Ape Atoll (Ape Atoll), Taverly Dungeon (Training).

Ahrim has a maximum hit of 20. (Magic Prayer)
Dharok has a maximum hit of 40. (Melee Prayer)
Guthan has a maximum hit of 32. (Melee Prayer)
Karil has a maximum hit of 22. (Range Prayer)
Torag has a maximum hit of 26. (Melee Prayer)
Verac has a minimum hit of 5 and a maximum hit of 18 (Prayer does NOT work)

So they&#39;re all pretty deadly if you don&#39;t have prayer to defend yourself, making barrows actually worth something now.

Also, I&#39;ve been adding onto thieving, changing the Experience, Rewards, Levels, adding new NPC&#39;s, etc.

I&#39;m also gonna consider working on putting together the H.A.M. Base for thieving/training/quest purposes AND for getting clue scrolls mainly (in real RuneScape, thieving H.A.M. Members gives level 1 clues, as does killing the H.A.M. Guards).


There&#39;s more I&#39;m working on, I removed all of the guilds that I had up originally and made and I&#39;m also redoing rewards, like Third Age items will have their stats reduced and added back to level 3 (Hard) clue rewards, the Dragon Platebody will be the reward from a very long and hard custom quest that leads you on dangerous fights, high leveled skills and even a bit of a risk in the wilderness and more.

All guilds that are already in the 317 servers, such as the Fishing Guild, Ranging Guild, Crafting Guild, Magic Guild, Hero&#39;s Guild, they will all be redone and used also and made as close to RuneScape as possible, we may even do a quest for the Hero&#39;s Guild or just make it require a certain combat level to enter. Who knows?</description>

              <p>Alright everyone, after taking a much needed break, a computer crash, a girlfriend breaking up with me, dating another girl and that ending a week after it started and working my ass off painting houses and doing other work that I was finally able to obtain, I’m SLOWLY - I repeat slowly coming back to programming.</p>
<p>Now, I doubt I’ll be able to retrieve all that I’ve lost, which pisses me off, but what can I do? Start over and I intend to, I started out working on Project Corrupted to be as realistic to RuneScape as it could be, just a tad less difficult and I damn well plan to finish it.</p>
<p>My goals for Project Corrupted include every working teleport, every working skill with as much to do in each skill as you can, what I mean by this is EVERY NPC that can be thieved, will have a reward for thieving it, every chest, a reward, every stall, a reward, they will of course be like RuneScape’s rewards, but they are rewards nonetheless, the same goes for farming, everything from Allotments to Trees.</p>
<p>I’ve got no idea how long this will take me, much less do I care, I won’t be focusing on it 100% like I used to and any data and progress I make this time around will be stored on my backup drive, so, hopefully not, but if another crash does happen to me, all of my progress will be saved/backed up.</p>
<p>So, I guess what I’m saying here is simple:</p>
<p>Long Live Project Corrupted.</p>

              <p>Clay couldnt u just put some aggresive npcs around the portals with a respawn rate of 30 also i have a hunch that the numbers after the intial coords are like the coords of the area the npc can walk in so u could make them able to walk all round pest control if that works and attack the players</p>

              <p>Interesting lol.</p>
<p>Well still not much done, it’s pretty much one of them ‘take a break’ runs.</p>
<p>Goth updated Pest Control so now it’s a safe zone, I redid the rewards system a bit, so Pest Control is looking nice, though if anyone happens to know, this would be a nice little feature,</p>
<p>if someone could provide a small TuT or something via PM or e-mail on how to make the four pest control portals SPAWN npc’s per second? Like every 30 seconds a wave of NPC’s comes and a wave consists of 3-4 NPC’s.</p>
