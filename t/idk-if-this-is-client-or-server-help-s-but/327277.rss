    <title>IDK if this is client or server help :S but</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/idk-if-this-is-client-or-server-help-s-but/327277</link>
    <description>My mate joined my server, he got in alright, he can spawn, eat, drink and even fight if he uses autoretaliate to hit me back, BUT... If he clicks to walk somewhere the client closes on him. He has tried different accounts, downloaded new javas nothing works. My other friend can use the server fine with no problems. :S

Any idea how to fix this for my friend who cant move without closing client? :S

All help is apreciated, Thanks!  ;)</description>

Dark_Dev, Get your friend to make a moparscape account and have him post the problem because if we are talking to him it would be easier as we can see his screen w/TeamViewer.</p>
