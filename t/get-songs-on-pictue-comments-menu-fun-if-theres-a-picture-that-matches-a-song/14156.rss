    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/get-songs-on-pictue-comments-menu-fun-if-theres-a-picture-that-matches-a-song/14156</link>
    <description>Ok, I learned this neet-o (lol) trick to put songs on someones picture menu. I did this to my sisters boyfriend, he had a picture, so I put the 007 Theme song on it.
EXAMPLE
http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?...71-ec8bbdba21c5

1. Make a free account at Freewebs.com or use the one I use for music.
Username:arminathmusic
Pass:iforgot
Please don&#39;t change the password.

2. Upload the song you want by going to the file manager.

3. After the song is uploaded, take the linkto this song and insert it in this string in the correct place

&lt;EMBED SRC=&quot;&lt;INSERT LINK HERE&gt;&quot; WIDTH=&quot;0&quot; HEIGHT=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

After that, paste the entire code in the comment pictures box, and submit.

Done, There was one girl who made herself look blue, I put the smrufs themesong on it  :P

PM me if you have any questions.
