    <title>[23 MARCH] Zombie horror (BETA Release)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/23-march-zombie-horror-beta-release/433552</link>
    <description>First ever game I&#39;ve really done from scratch, despite being done in GML, it is 95% code, not using the inbuilt drag and drop actions and events, so I can transfer the concepts to other languages when I get the time :)


Based on the CoD nazi zombies, it only features 4 different weapons and 2 rooms at the moment, but the waves of zombies are endless, get increasingly harder to kill, and spawn frequency is increased as the waves progress.  Mainly just focused on it being near bug free for the moment before I roll on the fun.

If anyone wants to give it a try: [url=http://up.ht/GNq7kj]http://up.ht/GNq7kj[/url]
Read the how to play on the menu first.
Criticism much appreciated :) 

Current version uploaded is 1.0.6.
Not sure what&#39;s to come in future, probably just more weapons, different levels and probably different powerups.

[b]Update log:[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]1.0.1 (21/02/2012)[/b]
- Menu changes, made it click-able, and the W and S keys can now be used to move up and down.
- Pause menu colours changed to look similar to main menu, for consistency.
- Arrays for a light machine gun have been added and the weapon changing methods have been modified accordingly, sprite also done.

[b]1.0.2 (24/02/2012)[/b]
- Reworked the weapon pickup function so it can be used for all weapons by just changing 2 variables in the create event, instead of editing over 20 values in the step event, for each weapon added.  As well as using an &#39;or&#39; operator instead of an &#39;else if&#39;, general cleansing.  Fixed a glitch where the question would appear and after clicking yes, ammo was not given.  Also made it so when purchasing a weapon, a question appears stating the string name of the weapon.
- Added a devmode switch which features a standard console where anything can be changed and spawned, as well as 5 standard key bindings which only work when devmode is enabled (hp, score, kills, max ammo, and nuke).
- Modified weapon damages and rates to be more balanced.

[b]1.0.3 (01/03/2012)[/b]
- Added regenerating health and slightly decreased the rate in which damage is dealt to the player.
- Added zombie dying animations, sprite changes, zombie becomes deceased and doesn&#39;t move, after two seconds the body disappears.
- Ammo crates now disappear after 30 seconds if not picked up, also features a countdown so you can tell when it&#39;ll go.
- Fixed a bug where if you repair the barricades when they&#39;re at full HP they will revert to broken down image state, not sure how I missed that.  Also added some messages, and stopped the user losing score when repairing the barricade when at full HP.
- Added a question prompt to either play again or exit to menu when player dies.

[b]1.0.4 (02/03/2012)[/b]
- Added insta kill pickup based on a random timer, this was a huge annoying piece of code to get this working...

[b]1.0.5 (06/03/2012)[/b]
- Finished off the insta kill pickup including the sprite.
- Made the ammo boxes drop similarly to the insta kills, now based on time, not amount of kills.
- Modified the nuke command so it can be easily changed to suit a nuke pickup in the future.

[b]1.0.6 (23/03/2012) (BETA Release)[/b]
- General bug fixes.
- Optimised code, got rid of 6 pages of code by rewriting some bits inside function scripts instead of individually in the code.  Swapped a huge chunk of if statements for a case switch.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


[b]Planned updates:[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;- Hiscores menu (top priority).
- Player [s]and zombie[/s] dying animations, [s]zombie bodies will disappear after a set time.[/s]
- [s]Regenerating health.[/s]
- [s]Ammo drops will disappear after a set time if not picked up.[/s]
- Shooting animations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


[b]Known bugs/glitches:[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;- Player clips and gets stuck with walls occasionally, may try redoing the collision mask.
- If you fix the barriers whilst a zombie is on top, the zombie will get stuck.  Not too big of an issue as the zombie will just break the wall down then continue walking.
- The newly added menu mouse clicking only &#39;clicks&#39; on what is already selected by the directional or W and S keys, not sure what to do about this yet.
- If enter is pressed at any point during the game, the level restarts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

I wouldn’t recommend using GML after your class is finished, so I wouldn’t put the effort into learning about how to use the intricacies of it unless it’s required for your school. You could put that time into learning 3D design in anything really. Java or .NET, whatever.<br>
[/quote]Actually, I think it would be better for him to try his hands at a 3D game in Game Maker first, just to get an idea of how cameras and the 3rd dimension work. Although, if I’m not mistaken, he’s a modeler and probably knows most of it. Still, it’s totally different programming a 3D game than working with 3D software.<br>
[/quote]Is GML easier to understand with those concepts? I mean you can learn the concepts with literally any language, but if you get your hand held with GML you’re kinda stuck having to learn a new way, whereas if you use java, or C+/#, most of the opengl methods are relatively the same. I don’t know enough about GML3D to make a good judgment though.<br>
[/quote]I started all gaming with Game Maker. Both 2D and 3D.[/quote]And would you say adapting from Game Maker was easy? As in, not having to relearn the concepts for creating games in other languages? (For you, C#) To me it seems like it’s completely different, and knowing how to do it in GML would only help you from the design perspective, because you can focus more on that instead of the actual programming</p>

Oh, and is that real 3D made from 3D models?  Just I’m looking at a forum thread now and they’re all talking about some third party script they have to use to import models, d3d_model_load_ext.</p>

              <p>First ever game I’ve really done from scratch, despite being done in GML, it is 95% code, not using the inbuilt drag and drop actions and events, so I can transfer the concepts to other languages when I get the time <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Based on the CoD nazi zombies, it only features 4 different weapons and 2 rooms at the moment, but the waves of zombies are endless, get increasingly harder to kill, and spawn frequency is increased as the waves progress.  Mainly just focused on it being near bug free for the moment before I roll on the fun.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to give it a try: <a href="http://up.ht/GNq7kj" data-bbcode="true">http://up.ht/GNq7kj</a><br>
Read the how to play on the menu first.<br>
Criticism much appreciated <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Current version uploaded is 1.0.6.<br>
Not sure what’s to come in future, probably just more weapons, different levels and probably different powerups.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Update log:</span></p>
<blockquote>[b]1.0.1 (21/02/2012)[/b]
- Menu changes, made it click-able, and the W and S keys can now be used to move up and down.
- Pause menu colours changed to look similar to main menu, for consistency.
- Arrays for a light machine gun have been added and the weapon changing methods have been modified accordingly, sprite also done.
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1.0.2 (24/02/2012)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Reworked the weapon pickup function so it can be used for all weapons by just changing 2 variables in the create event, instead of editing over 20 values in the step event, for each weapon added.  As well as using an ‘or’ operator instead of an ‘else if’, general cleansing.  Fixed a glitch where the question would appear and after clicking yes, ammo was not given.  Also made it so when purchasing a weapon, a question appears stating the string name of the weapon.</li>
<li>Added a devmode switch which features a standard console where anything can be changed and spawned, as well as 5 standard key bindings which only work when devmode is enabled (hp, score, kills, max ammo, and nuke).</li>
<li>Modified weapon damages and rates to be more balanced.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1.0.3 (01/03/2012)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Added regenerating health and slightly decreased the rate in which damage is dealt to the player.</li>
<li>Added zombie dying animations, sprite changes, zombie becomes deceased and doesn’t move, after two seconds the body disappears.</li>
<li>Ammo crates now disappear after 30 seconds if not picked up, also features a countdown so you can tell when it’ll go.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where if you repair the barricades when they’re at full HP they will revert to broken down image state, not sure how I missed that.  Also added some messages, and stopped the user losing score when repairing the barricade when at full HP.</li>
<li>Added a question prompt to either play again or exit to menu when player dies.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1.0.4 (02/03/2012)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Added insta kill pickup based on a random timer, this was a huge annoying piece of code to get this working…</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1.0.5 (06/03/2012)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Finished off the insta kill pickup including the sprite.</li>
<li>Made the ammo boxes drop similarly to the insta kills, now based on time, not amount of kills.</li>
<li>Modified the nuke command so it can be easily changed to suit a nuke pickup in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1.0.6 (23/03/2012) (BETA Release)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>General bug fixes.</li>
<li>Optimised code, got rid of 6 pages of code by rewriting some bits inside function scripts instead of individually in the code.  Swapped a huge chunk of if statements for a case switch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Planned updates:</span></p>
<blockquote>- Hiscores menu (top priority).
- Player [s]and zombie[/s] dying animations, [s]zombie bodies will disappear after a set time.[/s]
- [s]Regenerating health.[/s]
- [s]Ammo drops will disappear after a set time if not picked up.[/s]
- Shooting animations.</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Known bugs/glitches:</span></p>
<blockquote>- Player clips and gets stuck with walls occasionally, may try redoing the collision mask.
- If you fix the barriers whilst a zombie is on top, the zombie will get stuck.  Not too big of an issue as the zombie will just break the wall down then continue walking.
- The newly added menu mouse clicking only 'clicks' on what is already selected by the directional or W and S keys, not sure what to do about this yet.
