    <title>What makes a good game, good?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-makes-a-good-game-good/249325</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve been thinking about this lately, and my opinion is if the story line is true. When I used to play Call of Duty 4, I never really felt attached to the campaign. I went through and did a bit of research and found out that story line is actually true, and ever since then I respected it.

Having gotten World at War, I&#39;m still trying to find out if there is people such as Private Miller, Sgt Roebuck, etc.

Anyway, your opinion?</description>

              <p>Anything new makes something fun. If I’ve seen it before, it will most likely be boring. FPS’s that are all the same get boring, but when they add cool new stuff (an example is Crysis where you had a super-suit) for you to play with, the game is fun. But if I played another game with a super suit I might not like it as much because I have already experienced it.</p>

On the whole, it has got to have a good story mode an absolute necessity. Online play must be addictive and well balanced. Realism(to a certain degree, obviously with some games realism isnt in the eqaution) Controls must be easy to get to grips with. And being able to choose controls yourself is a brilliant idea and should be standard!. UI cant be cluttered. No invisible walls that ruins a game <em>cough</em>COD5<em>cough</em> And on the whole a good concept, if its a bad idea the game wont be as good as a game made half aswell but based around a good conept.</p>

<p>Dynamics - Needs balance, but is also fun to play because it’s a challenge. Lots of different levels and terrains, as well as weaponry/itinerary.</p>
<p>Worthy Objective - Obviously something that commits to the story line, and that actually makes sense.</p>
<p>Good story line - Speaks for itself imo.[/quote]Played Mirror’s Edge?</p>
<p>Also, my list goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Graphics/Physics :   It’s sad, but I really can’t enjoy a game if it doesn’t push my system’s graphics abilities.  It needs to make my eyes happy :).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storyline:   I’m not always on multiplayer, so an immersing storyline is great.  You are correct about the CoD4 storyline, it is very respectable when you read up on how they made it.  Also, it is not the case for CoD5 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiplayer:   This one is HUGE for me.  90% of the time I am on my 360, i am on Xbox Live.  If the multiplayer is not fun, the game is not fun.  CoD4 had a fun multiplayer, but I wish they had made it splitscreen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realism:   I don’t exactly mean realism like real to an every day life standard, but if it is a shooter, make it realistic.  If it is sci-fi, make it a possible future.  I hate games that go all of the place in realism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Controls:   Not all games have changeable controller options, so if they don’t, the defaults had better be good.</p>
</li>
</ol>

              <p>My thought is that if it’s an FPS, then it’s about a lot of action with a plot behind it so it’s not pointless shooting, if it’s an FPS online then it’s a lot of communicating and constant fights.  With RPG games, it must be an easy game that everyone thinks they are good at and makes people feel good since they can become better than other players.</p>
<p>I never really thought much of the Call of Duty stories since they all seemed pretty similar and it’s just that you’re given a task to do ___ and you kill a bunch of people while doing it.  It’s fun, but I enjoy sci-fi games a bit more than realistic games, GoW and Halo are my favorites.  What annoys me about COD games is that they aimed for realism, which means you die in 1 shot and people are hiding in windows, around corners, and it’s a constant camping game.</p>

              <p>Well, I’ve been thinking about this lately, and my opinion is if the story line is true. When I used to play Call of Duty 4, I never really felt attached to the campaign. I went through and did a bit of research and found out that story line is actually true, and ever since then I respected it.</p>
<p>Having gotten World at War, I’m still trying to find out if there is people such as Private Miller, Sgt Roebuck, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, your opinion?</p>
