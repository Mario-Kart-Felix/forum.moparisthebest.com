    <description>Hi Their.
I&#39;m Currently Under The Making of Southscape. The Server Is Going Quite well, But Only %3 Finished!

Because Im Coding, Im To Busy To Make a Client. The Server Name Is Southscape, So Most Things Should Say &quot;Southscape Is Loading, Please Wait&quot; Etc.. 

I also Need It So Theirs No Ip To Type In, You Can only Connect To Southscape with This Client. - This Is Not Required.

Their Should Be a Nice Background Picture, Or Someone Can Send Me The Blank Client &amp; a Good Tutorial on How To Change The &quot;Welcome To Southscape, Etc..&quot; 

Thanks,
Gh0styscape.</description>
