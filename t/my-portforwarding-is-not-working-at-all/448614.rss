              <p>Try using uTorrent to help you portforward, i’ve used it for years i can litterly portforward in 1-2 mins.</p>
<p>make sure your port is 43594, and for your ip what i do which is really easy…</p>
<p>do ipconfig/all<br>
Get your ip, then put it in, save it, and check to see if the port opens via utorrent.</p>
<p>lets say your last ip digits are 1.1   try going up to 1.10</p>
<p>it makes it easy to get it all setup.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helped ya a little bit atleast.</p>
<p>Goodluck.</p>
