    <title>eXistenZ</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/existenz/213184</link>
    <description>I just watched a very interesting Science Fiction movie, it was quite old. It came out in 1999, but still holds water today. Pretty much the movie was about Virtual Reality, and the differences between it and Real Life. The movie had many twists and turns, and leaves you with many questions at the end. The movie takes place mostly in a game, called &#39;eXistenZ&#39;. With two main characters (Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law), who over the course of the movie develop a romantic interest in each other. 

The movie starts out in a church, where they are playing the game, in an underground environment. The game creator (Jennifer Jason Leigh)is hosting the event, and they begin the game. As the game starts, an assassin walks onto the stage and shoots Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who then is rushed out of the church and into a place of hiding by her escort (Jude Law). On the way, Ted Pikul (Jude Law) reluctantly recieves a &#39;bio port&#39;, the access point for which the game system connects to the body. The administer of the Bio Port infects Ted Pikul, and so they must flee to a cabin, to save Ted, and the game system. 

When the game system is saved, they finally begin to play the game together. Throughout their time of playing the game they change scenes quite a few times. From a game store, to a fish market, and to a few other places. All during, they complete objectives set out for them. As they progress through the game, they become more and more confused about their environment, and whether they are in Real Life or in a game. Through a twist of events, all of the supporting characters are killed, and they kill each other. 

The movie is very fast paced, and seems shorter than it actually is. I would&#39;ve like it more if they had visited more places, a city would&#39;ve really helped to flesh out the story. The movie really makes you wonder what life might be like in the future, if there may be a war between virtual reality and real life. I won&#39;t go into much more detail about the ending, but it kind of makes you wonder at the end.

I give this movie a 6/10.</description>

              <p>Holy shit, I cannot believe I finally found out what this was called! I was thinking about this movie just the other day.</p>
<p>See I used to have a tv in my room when I was very young and I used to be up quite late usually flicking through the channels, and anyway I turned onto a channel with this movie on and I watched it until the end. I can’t remember whether it was that good or not, but its always been left there in my brain; and I’ve never known its name.</p>
<p>Well now I know I’m not sure what to do; my life feels a little bit more complete, even if I do not plan to watch the movie again hehe.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway!</p>
