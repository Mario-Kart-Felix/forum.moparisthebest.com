          <blockquote>
              <p>It’s acceptable to identify with characters and attempt to imitate them, but it’s not normal to completely mimic a character. I often desire to be like characters who are calm, rational, friendly, and selfless. I think about these traits for a few hours or days, but afterward, I disregard them and move on; change occurs gradually, and one must put effort into it. I think the person you’re studying mimics fictional characters because he is not happy with his identity. He would rather assume the identity of someone who is intelligent and respected, loved, etc. If he is your friend, and if you care for him, you should explain the situation to him and attempt to help him recover. Explain he is using anime (the different story universes) as escapism, refusing to acknowledge and deal with his troubles. Find out why he is depressed, actively listen to his reasons, try to understand his position/state of mind, be there for him and be patient, and hang out with him/try to get him to become more sociable (don’t be pushy). If that doesn’t help, read books on psychology, become knowledgeable about related or relevant subject material (depression), and/or seek help from friends/family or professionals.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with being motivated by a fictional character. The character Dexter’s job as a blood splatter analyst is interesting, and I once considered majoring in forensic science. I’ve heard Neon Genesis Evangelion helps people recover from depression. Also, Welcome to the NHK provides commentary on hikikomori (socially withdrawn people); the anime is basically about a girl trying to make a guy sociable again. You can use these two series to help that individual.</p>
<p>It’s not right to criticize anime for the guy’s condition. He could have become this way after reading books, watching movies, or by doing nothing. It’s his own fault–whether intentional or not–not anime’s. So, no, anime doesn’t make most people depressed. I always say, “There’s always a choice.” If you are unhappy with something, you often are able to do something about it. If the guy wants to get better, he has to put in the effort. You can’t just expect life to get better. If he wants to stay depressed, that’s the choice he made.</p>
<p>“In any situation, no matter how confining, you have a choice. To believe you do not, is to choose not to choose.”</p>
<p>P.S. Good luck with your <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/blog/2014/02/06/mopar-monthly-6/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">aspiration</a> of becoming a homicide detective, Mason.</p>

              <p>So we have the same expectation on different fictions, though, I didn’t suggest for him to watch only Naruto but something like Naruto, I did not dictate and say Naruto was the only anime he should watch nor did I say for any other, it was an example. I wanted him to look for a more up-beat anime, I wasn’t spoon feeding either.</p>
<p>I feel like I need to justify what I’m saying. The only reason I am taking a huge interest in this is because a I’ve been studying someone who has taken into account that after everything he watches or does, he wants to mimic. An example last year this person had an interest in the trilogy Iron Man, he then continued to mimic Tony Stark and set his career to shadow the ones of a fictional character. That’s a bit far from the topic but here’s another example, he took an interest in anime, as soon as he did he became a typical sterotyped nerd, he loved a certain character who stayed in his room and used the computer 24/7, he as you guessed it - decided to mimic this character. But that wasn’t the end of it, he carried on to watch different anime, death note to evangalion to clannad to w.e else he watched. As soon as he watched all of these he started to end up becoming quite anti-social, his personality changed from being depressed to being an asshole, though, I think another factor of this is because he is already a damaged person due to the loss of his mother at a young age, idk. Even so, before his addiction to anime he was into other things and he was at least happier and more outgoing, keep in mind his attitude and personality changed while watching anime, he seemed to have made him more depressed. Reasoning for all this is I want to find out if this effects most people or not, maybe it was just his own personality. Anime just seemed to make him quite a bit anti-social.</p>
<p>Btw, I did look into other bits of media like music and films, not just anime.</p>

<p>Naruto is the only anime I watch, if I watch anything else it just feels like I’m wasting my time with drama and bull shit no one wants in their life. But if you’re actually looking into wasting a ton of your time, and eventually makes you wonder what you’re doing with your life then head over to the crunchyroll website for a list. Honestly, watching those drama anime shows is like sticking needles in your eyes just to make you cry because you want to.</p>

<p>I suggest to keep your sanity, stick with an anime that is short (like Naruto) and is weekly, something you don’t have to spend hours watching and then minutes figuring out what happened. These are the reasons I like Naruto, it’s short and sweet, it’s quick to the point, it’s action packed and it’s an on the go show - meaning you can watch it whenever you want and still have time to do whatever you want during the day. All I am trying to say is that anime seems like a lonely option to take, it seems very depressing, but hey that’s just my opinion.</p>

<p>It’s difficult for me to take you seriously. I thought you were being sarcastic, but it appears you weren’t. You don’t feel like you’re wasting time with Naruto? I’ll use your own words to explain. Naruto is just “drama and bullshit.” It’s the anime for people who are “actually looking into wasting a ton of your time” and “makes you wonder what you’re doing with your life.” If you want to “keep your sanity, stick with an anime that is short.” 500+ episodes is not short; lol, with all the time you’ve spent watching Naruto, you could have watched over 20+ better anime series.</p>
<p>If you are not an idiot, you shouldn’t have any trouble understanding most anime. 90% of anime requires no thinking.</p>
<p>You are free to watch whatever you like. I don’t care you like Naruto (it’s your time, not mine), but to encourage only watching Naruto is something I cannot overlook. Furthermore, you cannot give an opinion on those anime based on your friends’ reactions. If you haven’t seen any anime other than Naruto, your opinion of anime is meaningless to me.</p>

<p>If you watch an enormous amount of anime, please do tell me what you feel about life, about yourself and what your personality is like after, I really am genuinely curious.</p>

</aside>
<p>Just like works from other mediums (books, films, TV shows, art, music, etc.), anime doesn’t have to change you. Your personality doesn’t have to change, nor do you have to reflect on life or yourself. If an anime, or any other work, encourages self-reflection, then isn’t it something that should be viewed?</p>
