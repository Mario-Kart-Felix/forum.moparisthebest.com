    <title>Exp Lock Question</title>

    <description>Hi, I am having a problem with exp lock.

I have the command line
[code]			if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;lock&quot;)) {
                        if (c.xplock == 0) {
                        c.xplock = 1;
                        c.sendMessage(&quot;You lock your xp! Type it again to unlock.&quot;);
                        } else {
                        c.xplock = 0;
                        c.sendMessage(&quot;You unlock your xp!&quot;);
                        }
			}[/code]

the problem I am having is when I set the player save for xplock
when I would log on it would delete everything in my character file

how do i fix this?</description>
