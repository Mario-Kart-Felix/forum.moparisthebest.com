<p>Built this big block which tested at 1500HP @ 5500RPM (graph to the left doesn’t read properly unless the motor is actually running). it’s really in depth. From choosing what material to make the heads out of, to the compression, to the exhaust system you get to design the whole motor and then throw it in a car you get to build yourself. (Vehicle builder isn’t very in-depth, yet.). Anyways, they’re adding a multiplayer mode, eventually, let me know if anyone gets it so we can try the multiplayer out, when released.</p>

<p>Right now it’s in very early access and you can only build the cars, at this moment. Now they’ve begun working on the tycoon mode, which will allow you to run your own car manufacturing company, handling financing, customer demand and what not.</p>

Early access games are something people tend to take both sides on. I support them personally, it parallels with donating on Kickstarter to a certain degree, giving them money in hopes it will be finished. Can’t complain too much there, in the games current state, <span class="bbcode-b">I</span> enjoy it thoroughly only because these are the types of things I like, I’ll probably spend more time in sandbox than tycoon mode even when it is released.</p>

<p>^THIS. Holy fu<span class="bbcode-b"></span>ck.<br>
When you’re playing early access, you’re basically playing the Beta (or even Alpha) phase of a game. In the past, people were always paid to do that, or got to do it free, and the account would carry over (Or in that region of ideas).</p>
<p>Like, why should I have to pay for a broken game so you can fix it? When I’m purchasing a product, I want a working product. Not a buggy half ton pile of crap the developers “Are working on” (And I know not all E.A. Games are not buggy pieces of crap).</p>
<p>I remember when game companies would send a global announcement (Like Bungie did a few times with the halo series, if I remember correctly) saying something like “only the first 500 sign ups get free beta access” and then after that no one could join until the game was released.</p>
<p>But now it’s all about the money… Or at least, that’s how it feels.</p>

        <p>It makes sense for beta to only be for members in RS’s because f2p members would be tossed into a realm they know nothing about and be expected to provide useful feedback. Because it would be ongoing as well, they don’t want people to be playing beta to freeload instead of buying membership. That’s one of the differences between an early-access beta/alpha that stops once the game launches, and an on-going test. Warcraft test realm works the same way, current subscribers only.</p>

And then you have to define what a “playable state” is.<br>
Because, depending on what the final product of the game is, you could consider the first stages of the game not playable.<br>
Like, lets take this car game you just bought. You said they have are working on adding the whole “tycoon” feature to run a manufacturing shop. Would it not make sense for them to release a copy of their game (Which the point of the game is to manage a manufacturing shop) with the manufacturing shop working? Or at least partially implemented.<br>
As far as I see it, in the current state, all they gave you is a car builder. Not a tycoon game.<br>
Sure, they may update it so it’s a tycoon game, but it <em>technically</em> isn’t one now as the feature isn’t there.<br>
[hr]<br>
Great example:<br>
The moparscape server alpha/beta/w.e.</p>
<p>We were able to login and “play” the game. But at least 70% of the content wasn’t working (not complaining, just stating).<br>
Would you consider that “playable”? because I wouldn’t. It’d be playable for the alpha/beta, but as a full game, no.</p>

Valve puts it very plain and simple, this is how early access works.</p>
<p>What I define as playable is pretty much the basic game loop in game development. Start, Logic, End. If the game starts, there’s an activity, and a way out, I consider that playable.</p>

Yes, I understand what early access is. However, I don’t support it. That was kinda the whole point of what I said.<br>
But if you look at what you just posted, it literally says that the game you just purchased “May or may not change further”. So, by that logic, the developers of a game can promise you the WORLD just so you buy the game, and then you only get an island. Then they can quit development and take the cash.</p>

You’re completely correct, right now it is only a car/engine builder.<br>

Valve puts it very plain and simple, this is how early access works.<br>

Yes, I understand what early access is. However, I don’t support it. That was kinda the whole point of what I said.<br>
But if you look at what you just posted, it literally says that the game you just purchased “May or may not change further”. So, by that logic, the developers of a game can promise you the WORLD just so you buy the game, and then you only get an island. Then they can quit development and take the cash.[/quote]<br>
Right, the game may never be finished. I bought the game acknowledging that factor. If I wanted the game fully with security I would wait until I was finished, if it ever is. I bought Spintires on Early Access, it never got all the shit that was promised because the publisher locked out the developer and stopped supporting it, shit happens but you get exactly what you pay for, anything else is fair game.</p>

It’s situational IMO. In it’s current state, I like the game, I could play the game for a long time. If you couldn’t play without the tycoon part, don’t buy it yet. Early access gives us a chance to almost “be a part” of the development even if the developers aren’t engaged with the players. If the game is still fun, and <span class="bbcode-b">sometimes</span> the early access price is lower, you get an advantage. DayZ was like $5 at some point wasn’t it? Granted it still sucks, but it’s a not a shitty $5 game, it’s a shitty $30 game. If you would have bought it at $5, you’d have the same game, with more content (and the same bugs, in this case).</p>

You are right, it does vary per game and development and etc.<br>
But, when they’re selling an <span class="bbcode-u">incomplete</span> game at the price full games go for, that’s just ridiculous.<br>
I understand that they’re probably selling it at/around full price because the people that get it will own the game even after EA is over, but the point of EA is for the players to help you, is it not? So why not give them a discount?<br>
I could see them raising the price as features are added, even.<br>
I.E: As the game stands now, it sells for $10. They add a new feature, like driving (just an example, i know it’s not a driving game), and then they raise the price to $15-$20. Or maybe they could raise it as they feel the content is less prone to bugs.</p>
<p>But if the game just barley came out and is selling for full price, and isn’t complete, I just don’t see how that’s appealing to anyone.<br>
[hr]<br>
Take a look at Besiege. That game is <span class="bbcode-u">wildly</span> popular. Like the internet exploded over it in a matter of days. The game is only $7 in Early Access. The game looks promising based on the community feedback overall, and they’re no where near done.<br>
Do you really think they’re going to keep selling it at $7? Nope. But them selling it at such a low price makes more people inclined to try it because they won’t feel like it’s such a loss. I’d rather spend $7 on a game that never gets finished instead of $30.</p>

        <p>Yeah, exactly, that’s how EA <em>should</em> work… The Automation developers are obviously money-hungry, a little absurd charging full price right out the gate, but they’re out there. However, it’s still a good product so I was okay with the price.</p>
