    <title>Automation - The Car Company Tycoon Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/automation-the-car-company-tycoon-game/550548</link>
    <description>This game just got put on steam, like yesterday, and even in it&#39;s very early access it&#39;s awesome. Anyone here who&#39;s into building vehicles and motors, and playing sandbox games, this is something you&#39;d enjoy.

Built this big block which tested at 1500HP @ 5500RPM (graph to the left doesn&#39;t read properly unless the motor is actually running). it&#39;s really in depth. From choosing what material to make the heads out of, to the compression, to the exhaust system you get to design the whole motor and then throw it in a car you get to build yourself. (Vehicle builder isn&#39;t very in-depth, yet.). Anyways, they&#39;re adding a multiplayer mode, eventually, let me know if anyone gets it so we can try the multiplayer out, when released.</description>

<p>Early access should be free (you are doing THEM a service by testing their game for them, saving them QA tester time), pay-what-you-want (like kickstarter), or at least a decent discount off the release price or a good large amount of benefits for helping… it should be the companies job to properly fund and budget their game, unless they make it clear its a crowdfunded game.</p>

Hence why I don’t support it.<br>
I don’t feel like supporting the idea of “risk taking” when it comes to buying a game.<br>
I want what I’m promised. If I go to buy a car, I don’t want to sign for a 2015 Ferarri and then find out that they’re only giving me a 2010 Mustang.<br>
[/quote]<br>
It’s situational IMO. In it’s current state, I like the game, I could play the game for a long time. If you couldn’t play without the tycoon part, don’t buy it yet. Early access gives us a chance to almost “be a part” of the development even if the developers aren’t engaged with the players. If the game is still fun, and <span class="bbcode-b">sometimes</span> the early access price is lower, you get an advantage. DayZ was like $5 at some point wasn’t it? Granted it still sucks, but it’s a not a shitty $5 game, it’s a shitty $30 game. If you would have bought it at $5, you’d have the same game, with more content (and the same bugs, in this case).[/quote]<br>
You are right, it does vary per game and development and etc.<br>
But, when they’re selling an <span class="bbcode-u">incomplete</span> game at the price full games go for, that’s just ridiculous.<br>
I understand that they’re probably selling it at/around full price because the people that get it will own the game even after EA is over, but the point of EA is for the players to help you, is it not? So why not give them a discount?<br>
I could see them raising the price as features are added, even.<br>
I.E: As the game stands now, it sells for $10. They add a new feature, like driving (just an example, i know it’s not a driving game), and then they raise the price to $15-$20. Or maybe they could raise it as they feel the content is less prone to bugs.</p>
<p>But if the game just barley came out and is selling for full price, and isn’t complete, I just don’t see how that’s appealing to anyone.<br>
[hr]<br>
Take a look at Besiege. That game is <span class="bbcode-u">wildly</span> popular. Like the internet exploded over it in a matter of days. The game is only $7 in Early Access. The game looks promising based on the community feedback overall, and they’re no where near done.<br>
Do you really think they’re going to keep selling it at $7? Nope. But them selling it at such a low price makes more people inclined to try it because they won’t feel like it’s such a loss. I’d rather spend $7 on a game that never gets finished instead of $30.</p>

<p>Early access gives people an opportunity for people to buy the game early instead of waiting months for it to have a final release. Sure, companies pay people some times to test their games, but that’s <span class="bbcode-b">entirely</span> different. These users are paid to look for glitches and bugs exclusively alot of the time, early access alot of times is just so you can play the game, once it reaches a playable state.<br>
[/quote]<br>
And then you have to define what a “playable state” is.<br>
Because, depending on what the final product of the game is, you could consider the first stages of the game not playable.<br>
Like, lets take this car game you just bought. You said they have are working on adding the whole “tycoon” feature to run a manufacturing shop. Would it not make sense for them to release a copy of their game (Which the point of the game is to manage a manufacturing shop) with the manufacturing shop working? Or at least partially implemented.<br>
As far as I see it, in the current state, all they gave you is a car builder. Not a tycoon game.<br>
Sure, they may update it so it’s a tycoon game, but it <em>technically</em> isn’t one now as the feature isn’t there.<br>
[hr]<br>
Great example:<br>
The moparscape server alpha/beta/w.e.</p>
<p>We were able to login and “play” the game. But at least 70% of the content wasn’t working (not complaining, just stating).<br>
Would you consider that “playable”? because I wouldn’t. It’d be playable for the alpha/beta, but as a full game, no.[/quote]<br>
You’re completely correct, right now it is only a car/engine builder.<br>

Valve puts it very plain and simple, this is how early access works.</p>
<p>What I define as playable is pretty much the basic game loop in game development. Start, Logic, End. If the game starts, there’s an activity, and a way out, I consider that playable.</p>

              <p>It makes sense for beta to only be for members in RS’s because f2p members would be tossed into a realm they know nothing about and be expected to provide useful feedback. Because it would be ongoing as well, they don’t want people to be playing beta to freeload instead of buying membership. That’s one of the differences between an early-access beta/alpha that stops once the game launches, and an on-going test. Warcraft test realm works the same way, current subscribers only.</p>

<p>^THIS. Holy fu<span class="bbcode-b"></span>ck.<br>
When you’re playing early access, you’re basically playing the Beta (or even Alpha) phase of a game. In the past, people were always paid to do that, or got to do it free, and the account would carry over (Or in that region of ideas).</p>
<p>Like, why should I have to pay for a broken game so you can fix it? When I’m purchasing a product, I want a working product. Not a buggy half ton pile of crap the developers “Are working on” (And I know not all E.A. Games are not buggy pieces of crap).</p>
<p>I remember when game companies would send a global announcement (Like Bungie did a few times with the halo series, if I remember correctly) saying something like “only the first 500 sign ups get free beta access” and then after that no one could join until the game was released.</p>
<p>But now it’s all about the money… Or at least, that’s how it feels.</p>

Early access games are something people tend to take both sides on.

Can’t complain too much there, in the games current state, <span class="bbcode-b">I</span> enjoy it thoroughly only because these are the types of things I like, I’ll probably spend more time in sandbox than tycoon mode even when it is released.</p>

              <p>Why couldn’t they just wait and release the game with the tycoon mode?<br>
Why does everyone support buying early access games? You’re buying an incomplete product in hopes that they finish it.<br>
besiege (besieged?) is the only early access game I bought, and that was because it was under $10.</p>

<p>Not sure about the longevity of such a limited type of sim. Are you actually managing a company that sells cars, having to balance a budget or anything like that? Building your own shop? Or is this literally a glorified Lego creations editor (with less freedom) that they expect you to pay 30 dollars for? If it is literally just a tool to build your own model cars I’d probably expect it to cost 10-15, not 30.</p>

<p>Right now it’s in very early access and you can only build the cars, at this moment. Now they’ve begun working on the tycoon mode, which will allow you to run your own car manufacturing company, handling financing, customer demand and what not.</p>

              <p>This game just got put on steam, like yesterday, and even in it’s very early access it’s awesome. Anyone here who’s into building vehicles and motors, and playing sandbox games, this is something you’d enjoy.</p>
<p><img src="http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/38617858245764529/C529633F4CBC5833F038EECF15A4D58B56D9A8E2/" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Built this big block which tested at 1500HP @ 5500RPM (graph to the left doesn’t read properly unless the motor is actually running). it’s really in depth. From choosing what material to make the heads out of, to the compression, to the exhaust system you get to design the whole motor and then throw it in a car you get to build yourself. (Vehicle builder isn’t very in-depth, yet.). Anyways, they’re adding a multiplayer mode, eventually, let me know if anyone gets it so we can try the multiplayer out, when released.</p>
