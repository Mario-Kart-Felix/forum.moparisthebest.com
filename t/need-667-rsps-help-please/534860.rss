    <description>Hi i am new on this forum but i really need help

two days ago i started my own 667 runescape private server it&#39;s the extinction client
i&#39;ve made my own jar file and a webclient
i don&#39;t want to put it on the internet for &#39;everyone&#39; i just want to have fun with some friends so thats why i use hamachi so that they can connect

but if my friend clicks on the jar file i sent him the loader stays at 1% and the webclient does the same i portforwarded port 43594 and still it stays 1% on their computer (it&#39;s not even neccesary to portforward if you&#39;re using hamachi right?)
i&#39;ve put the hamachi ip in the loader.java and still it doenst work

i really don&#39;t know what i&#39;m doing wrong so if there is anybody who can help me i will really appreciate it and if you want to play on the server your most welcome ;-)

thank you for reading i hope you can help.</description>
