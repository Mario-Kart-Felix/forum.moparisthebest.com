    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gios-server-dev-1-0/157429</link>
    <description>Ive finnaly decided to add this here. The server is dodian source, has some bugs, and a few things needed to be added. I am bassically looking for Mods, Coders,  Forum Mods, Beta Testers, forum designer, and maybe a hoster. This is my first dev team, so bare with me. If you want the link to the forum pm me. Also im only on the computer for maybe 2 hours a day.

I added new training places, kept some of the old ones, added a new boss, added a new ring that i have never seen in a server before.
