    <description>Hi everyone at MITB

Some of you might remember me, most of you will most likely to wonder who the f*ck am I. Its been a year since I left to serve my country at the Finnish Defence forces. I tried to follow the happenings here in the past year but I have been away from the computer most of the time. But now my compulsory military service has come to an end. I got my militarypass on last friday and have been partying like hell.

   I try to catch up with you guys here. It sure has been a long year and I know that lots of things have changed since I was here and that the community is runned by what I like to call the new generation.

If VG_Kobra is still around he can have the honor to get these parties started (he will know what I mean ;) )

How can a motorbike be nice if it is a KTM? Fucking European piece of shit. Nice and all, but reliability, shit.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Well they used to have Yamahas but they are now stopping using them and started using KTM. Why do you think KTM sucks? Imo they make the best enduro/motocross/supermoto bikes in the world. Really powerful and built with best parts. Reliability shit? Probably if you compare it to Yamaha it is, but after all I think KTM’s have much more power.[/quote]<br>
Okay, everyone is going to read my post and say it is because I am a Yamaha supporter, however it isn’t.</p>
<p>My friend from racing rides for KTM Australia, and my dad is great mates with the mechanic. He tells us that he is forever fixing Jason (my mate)'s bike from blowing up. KTM fails because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s junior development squad is filled with idiots without a clue, in every country. Only good rider to come off a KTM is Jay Marmont.</li>
<li>It is actually the slowest motorbike on the planet, whether that be motocross, enduro, or desert. The WR450f takes the throne of being the most powerful. Making 53.4 horsepower I think, according to our local shops dyno-testing.</li>
<li>It’s not built with the best parts, but it is lead to believe that because a lot of them are shiny aluminum. They claim to all be factory equipped parts, but why would they break? Speaking of factory equipped parts, the range of after-market parts range for KTM is filled with a lot, except none of them are as good as they will ever be when Pro-circuit decided to stop sponsoring them. The range of after-market parts has to go to Kawasaki/Yamaha, seeing as Pro-circuit is sponsoring them.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think I made all of the above up, you can google ‘Jason Reed’, as that is my mate and I assure you will find him to be on the Motorex KTM Team.</p>

Hi everyone at MITB</p>
<p>Some of you might remember me, most of you will most likely to wonder who the f*ck am I. Its been a year since I left to serve my country at the Finnish Defence forces. I tried to follow the happenings here in the past year but I have been away from the computer most of the time. But now my compulsory military service has come to an end. I got my militarypass on last friday and have been partying like hell.</p>
<p>I try to catch up with you guys here. It sure has been a long year and I know that lots of things have changed since I was here and that the community is runned by what I like to call the new generation.</p>
<p>If VG_Kobra is still around he can have the honor to get these parties started (he will know what I mean <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>
