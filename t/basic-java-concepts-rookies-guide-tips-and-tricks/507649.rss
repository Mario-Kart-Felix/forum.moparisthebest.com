    <description>In this tutorial I&#39;ll be showing you some cool java tips and tricks along with explanations and examples that you can easily follow by with.

Basics:

[u][b]Methods[/b][/u]

A method is considered as &quot;instructions&quot; for your application and links can be executed by either the main method (usually a start up of a application) or by other methods which may want execute it. Here&#39;s an example...

Here I created a method which does a simple job of printing a message &quot;Hello world!&quot;
[code=java]/**
 * Method used to print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
 */
public void myMethod() {
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);
}[/code]

Now the method has to be called somewhere otherwise it would just be sitting there doing nothing!
[code=java]/**
 * Main method used to start server
 */
public void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod(); // executes myMethod()
}[/code]

[u][b]Parenthesis
[/b][/u]

Parenthesis is just a posh word for brackets and braces } ( ) 

[b]Braces:[/b]

When you create a class you always have a brace { } to open the class and one to close it.

[code=java]public class Test {

}[/code]

If you miss out a brace you&#39;ll most likely get 100 errors whilst compiling.

[code=java]
public class Test {
    private int x;
    
    private void randomMethod() {
        if (x == 1) {
            System.out.println(&quot;x is equal to 1&quot;);
    }

}
[/code]

The above method &#39;randomMethod()&#39; looks fine and won&#39;t give us any errors. Will it? If you look at the 1st line of code within that method

[code=java]if (x == 1) {[/code]
we have a open parenthesis but its not closed because we have got a } at the end of the class but that will only close the method or the open variable so we need to make sure we close all statement. You fill up that section with everything you need then close it for example:

[code=java]private void randomMethod() {
    if (x==1) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello world!&quot;); // if x == 1 print hello world!
        x = 2; // make x = 2
    }
    // anything else which does not relate to x being 1 goes under the }
}[/code]

If I&#39;m making any sense to you guys :S

[b]Brackets[/b]: 

Everybody should know what a Bracket is but for those who don&#39;t its a curly line [b]( )[/b] 

How brackets work is easy and similar to braces except they need to be closed on the same line they where opened.

if (rand == 12 {

}

I have a open bracket within that IF statement but it is UN-closed so after you open a bracket and filled it with the junk you need just close the bracket ) then add the rest of your code after it.

public void example() {
    int rand;
    if (rand == 12) {
        System.out.println(&quot;rand is equal to 12&quot;);
   }
}

[u][b]Follow up IF and else statements[/b][/u]
An IF statement is literally 

[code]if (...) {

}[/code]

how they work is simple and if you think of it logically its pretty much saying [b]if [/b]something [b]is [/b]something then [b]do [/b]something; for example

[code=java]if (variable == number) {
    doSomething(); // this can be anything from execution and change of values
}[/code]

now to put that into real code it would be like
[code=java]
int random = 12;
public void method() {
    if (random == 12) { // if variable is something (can include bigger and less then)
        random ++; // do something (in this case increase the value)
    }
}[/code]

Else statements are just exactly the same as a IF statement but its more of a carry on of the if statement e.g. if variable is something then do something otherwise/else do this.

Here&#39;s an example of what I mean:

[code=java]    int random = 12;

    if (random &gt; 11) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Random is currently &quot; + random);
    } else {
        System.out.println(&quot;Random is smaller then 12!&quot;);
    }[/code]

what that code does is tell us the current value for the variable [b]random[/b] which is currently set to 12. If you do (random &gt; 11) { &lt; what that does is anything above 11 so if the variable was to be 11 the else statement would kick in telling us its smaller then 12 because we did not tell the application to include the 11. We&#39;ll get into the inequality signs in a few mins but first here&#39;s another example of if statements/else statements.


[code=java]    if (random == 1) {
        System.out.println(&quot;random is equal to: 1&quot;);
    } else if (random == 2) {
        System.out.println(&quot;random is equal to: 2&quot;);
    }[/code]

if you&#39;ve been reading most of what i&#39;m saying the code should litter ally be understandable as it is.
if random is equal to 1, print &quot;random is equal to: 1&quot; otherwise if random is equal to 2, print &quot;random is equal to 2&quot;

Easy? :)

Okay lets move on to [b]Definitions[/b] 

What I mean by definitions is defining crap such as when you define a variable its sort of similar to
[code=java]private int variable1;[/code]

For those users to like to play around with RuneScape private servers and never bothered learning Java or looking at its background, it probby looks like a bunch of crap to you. 

In a typical server such as project insanity (which is overused by allot of novices) you might see crap like [code]public Client c;[/code]
which basically defines Client.java 

When working with a declared class your basically gonna use something from another class e.g.

[code=java]/**
 * Client.java 
 *
 */
public class Client {
    /**
     * Simple method to print some random crap
     */
    public void sendMessage() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Message!@!!@&quot;);
    }
}[/code]

So we have a method in Client.java, now you may want to use it within another file without having to copy and paste the whole method to the other file. 

[code=java]public class Player {
     /**
      * defines Client with the variable c
      */
     private Client c;

     
     public void method12() {
          /**
           * c is defined above as Client followed by the method that needs to be executed
           */
          c.sendMessage();
     }
}[/code]


- at this point I&#39;m yawning and getting tired and don&#39;t really want to continue working on this tutorial tomorrow so sorry if i start slacking a bit. SOO MUCH MORE LEFT :(

[u][b]Booleans
[/b][/u]

A boolean is Java&#39;s term for on/off (true/false) and it can be applied in methods and you can make switches etc. 

Here&#39;s an example of a boolean:
[code]public boolean myMethod() {
    if (rand == 12) {
        executeMethod();
    return true;
    } else {
    return false;
}[/code]

As you can see I declared the method as a boolean instead of a void. what the method does is execute a method IF the variable rand is equal to 12. You MUST have a return statement (yes/no) so under executeMethod() I wrote return true; what that basically means is YES YES YES DO IT! and return false; NO NO NO STOP AND DON&#39;T DO ANYTHING! (simplest way to explain it)

You can also use booleans as an actual switch e.g.
[code=java]
private boolean serverRunning;

public void run() {
    if (serverRunning == true) {
        // what ever you want to run goes here
        serverRunning == true; // Just making sure the switch is set to ON 
        System.out.print(&quot;Server is online!&quot;); // gives us the message that server is now running
    } else if (serverRunning == false) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Server is ALREADY running!!!!!&quot;);// tell us that the server is already running
        serverRunning == false; // makes sure the switch is OFF
        System.exit(0); // close&#39;s the server
}[/code]

(may of made a mistake) 


What ^that basically does is stops multipul servers from being ran at one time so if serverRunning is set to true, that means yes it is running and the else statement tells us if the server is already running and closes the one you just attempted to start.


[u][b]Just a quick brief on Private and Public modifiers[/b][/u]

As you might of noticed I&#39;ve been doing stuff like private void or public void;
What that simply means is, IS that going to be used somewhere else OUTSIDE that class file. For example if you refer back to the private Client c; crap I showed earlier the sendMessage() method in Client.java was being used in Player.java so therefore sendMessage() must be declared public.
[b]public void sendMessage()
[/b]

^ I WILL BE ADDING MORE TO THIS!!!!

[b]TODO[/b]: 

add stuff about...
[s]ints[/s]
arrays
[s]switch statements[/s]
while
[s]loops etc.[/s]

[u][b]Integers/INTS, BYTE, SHORT, LONG[/b][/u]

Java stores integers in binary numbers (int, byte, short, long)

In Java, the &#39;int&#39; type is a primitive , whereas the &#39;Integer&#39; type is an object. The differences between objects and primitives are somewhat beyond the my noob intelligence, but to summarize, objects provide facilities for polymorphism, are passed by reference (or more accurately have references passed by value), and are allocated from the heap. Conversely, primitives are immutable types that are passed by value and are often allocated from the stack.

Did you understand that ^? Probably not. There will be a list of words followed by a definition at the bottom of this tutorial soon enough. 

Here is a rough idea of what the different data types are

[b]byte [/b]is made up of 8 bits (size) and it can range from -128 to 127.
So a byte is made up of 8 bits, quiet similar to a MEGABYTE (MB) where in MB there are 8388608 bits.

A [b]short [/b]has 2 bytes (16 bits) and it can range from -32,768 to +32,767
and it literally starts to double from here,

[b]int [/b]made up of 4 bytes	(32 bits) ranges from	-2,147,483,648 to	+2,147,483,647
[b]long [/b]made up of	8 bytes (64 bits) ranges from	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to	+9,223,372,036,854,775,80

Bits are the smallest possible data type.

Ints are commonly used maybe because it holds enough information and its easy to type? :P

private int value1; // a int which is named value1 (this is also a variable because the value can be changed!)

value1 == 2; // defines value1 as a 2
value1 +=1; // increases value1 by 1 so if values 1 was 2 for example; value1 would increase to 3


[u][b]Switch Statements[/b][/u]

A switch statement looks somewhat like this:

[code=java]switch(variable) {
    case 1:
       System.out.println(&quot;Hello MOPAR!&quot;);
      break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
      break;
    }
}[/code]

Switch statement is a tidier way of doing if/else if statements!

Here&#39;s a chunk of code quickly made so you guys can relate it to your RSPS.

[code=java]private void commands(Player player, String command) {
    if (command[0].equals(&quot;update&quot;)) {
        // send update
    }
    if (command[0].equals(&quot;master&quot;)) {
        // give player max stats
    }
}[/code]

That code can also be written like so:

[code=java]private void commands(Player player, String command) {
    if (command[0].equals(&quot;update&quot;)) {
        // send update
    } else if (command[0].equals(&quot;master&quot;)) {
        // give player max stats
    }
}[/code]

To make a switch statement you put the crap that would go in within the IF statement and put it into a switch statement like this:

[code]switch (command) {
    case&quot;update&quot;:
      //send update
      break;
    case&quot;master&quot;:
      //give player max stats
      break;
}[/code]

You must make sure you have a colon after the case (case&quot;test&quot;:) and don&#39;t forget to add [b]break; [/b]

Another cool thing about switch statements are you can stack things example:

[b]case&quot;master&quot;:
case&quot;max&quot;:
maxstats();
 break;[/b]

What that does is if the the command is called master or max it will still give execute the same command without needing to retype it or do any special operations.

[u][b]Loops[/b][/u]

What is a loop? A loop is something which keeps going and does not stop a bit like a circle lol? 

[code=java]public void loop() {
    while (true) {
        System.out.println(&quot;LOOPPING!&quot;);
    }
}[/code]

That above code will just SPAM LOOPING! a million times until you stop the application!
Loops are usually used in processes that are not to be stopped such as networking, having a process after x seconds etc etc

You can use a boolean also for looping e.g. 

[code=java]boolean loop = true; // the on/off switch for the loop

while (loop) {
 // crap goes here
}
[/code]

[u][b]Generics[/b][/u]
When a class is defined with the parameter (or parameters) then it’s called as Parameterized class. It’s another name for generic class. The parameter is called as Type parameter.

Here&#39;s an example:

[code=java]public class PTest&lt;E&gt; extends ArrayList&lt;E&gt; {
   //stuff goes here
}[/code]

The above class PTest is parameterized with one parameter type ‘E’’ but it can have more than one parameter. Type parameter is an unqualified identifier that is used as a place holder. This will be replaced by the compiler with the specified Type when an object is created for the generic class. 

Instanciation where the parameter is replaced with an Integer
[code]PTest &lt;Integer&gt; ptest= new PTest&lt;Integer&gt; ();[/code]

You can also do:

[code=java]public class First&lt;T&gt; extends Second&lt;String&gt; implements Runnable&lt;String&gt; {
 
   @Override
   public void run() {
       //TODO:
   }
}[/code]

Sorry if i&#39;m starting to not make sense here :(


[b][u]Enum[/b][/u]

What is a Enum? 
Enum is type like class and interface and can be used to define a set of Enum constants. Enum constants are implicitly static and final and you can not change there value once created. Enum in Java provides type-safety and can be used inside switch statment like int variables.

Here&#39;s an example:
[code=java]public enum STATE{ LOGIN, HANDSHAKE, REQUEST }[/code]

You can add it within a switch statement too like with any primitive types such as ints;
[code]   switch (state) {
            case REQUEST:
                    System.out.println(&quot;Request&quot;);
                    break;
            case HANDSHAKE:
                    System.out.println(&quot;Handshake&quot;);
                    break;
            case LOGIN:
                    System.out.println(&quot;Login&quot;);
                    break;
    }[/code]

Enum type is a data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it. 
You should use Enum whenever you need to represent a fixed set of constants

And for those who don&#39;t know what a constant is, its basically something that does not change! For Enum it&#39;s basically a set of conditions which it will always follow whatever the variables must be. If that makes any sense :S

[u][b]Parameters[/b][/u] - reference from mindprod.org
A parameter is a variable that you pass in to a function. Kinda like an argument...only not as loud and frustrating.

Parameters are always passed by value not by reference. The called method gets a copy of each primitive and a copy of the pointer to each object. The called method can therefore not change any local variables in the caller. However it can change the contents of objects (which includes strings and arrays) passed to it. Some people may argue that counts as call by reference, however a calle cannot make the callers variables point to different objects, just change the contents of objects. Objects are always accessed by reference, (literally via a reference) even when parameters are not involved. You can kludge call by reference by passing values back to your caller inside an array or by returning a freshly minted object full of values.

[code=java]/**
 * add two numbers
 * @param a first addend
 * @param b second addend
 * @return sum of a+b
 */
static int add( int a, int b )
   {
   // a and b are &#39;parameters&#39;, the variables the callee uses to accept inputs.
   return a + b;
   }
[/code]

It&#39;s sort of similar to having a variable declared but in this case its for a sole method only.




[u][size=12pt]Starting your own Java application? [/size][/u]

In this part of the tutorial I&#39;ll be showing you some cool tips and tricks alongside most of the information you need to know when creating your own crap.

I would recommend you read up on Java docs by Oracle since it will help you out (its not very graphically friendly sadly :( )

When you first start building an application/server you&#39;ll always need a MAIN method that will literally hold all your start up processes.
Main methods are created like so:

[code=java]public static void main(String[] args) {
    // all your stuff goes here
}[/code]

making sure all your methods link up etc etc is vital because if you create a method that&#39;s not being called anywhere; you&#39;ll be stuck with it being unused and wasting space.

Here&#39;s a quick example of a basic application:

[code=java]public class Server {
    private int moparscape;
    private int runeServer;
    private int google;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        init();
    }

    private boolean init() {
        if (runeServer &amp;&amp; google &gt; moparscape) {
            System.out.println(&quot;Something went wrong here....&quot;);
        return false;
    } else if (moparscape &gt; google || runeServer) {
        System.out.println(&quot;You are on the correct path of learning to program!&quot;);
        moparscape++;
        return true;
    }

}[/code]

^ my quick crappy code (not going to explain what it does lol) but as you can see I have my variables declared, methods created, main method created, my methods are being called and it should run perfectly fine :)



[b]Some cools things you can try out...[/b]

[code=java]
/**
 * Define the TimerTask class (already comes with Java)
 */
private TimerTask t;

public void sayHello() {
     if (System.currentTimeMillis() - t.scheduledExecutionTime() &gt;= 5) { // code to scheduled an execution time
         System.out.println(&quot;Its been 5 seconds now: HELLO!!!!&quot;); // print message
     }

}[/code]

What the method does is, give a 5 second delay before doing what ever in my case saying HELLO!!!! (untested just assuming)

Another way to add a delay is Thread.sleep(x);
Its literally the same thing as scheduledExecutionTime but add a ms delay so the process completely freezes e.g.

     thread.sleep(1000); // code to scheduled an execution time
         System.out.println(&quot;Its been 5 seconds now: HELLO!!!!&quot;); // print message
     }

for sleep(); it works with milliseconds so 1000 ms == 1 second

A cool way to use ints:

People may use this for god knows what starter kits or your server?

private int starter;

[code=java]public void giveStarter() {
    if (starter == 0) {
        addItem(4151, 1);
        addItem(11694, 1):

        starter == 1;
        sendMessage(&quot;You have just received a start kit!&quot;);

    } else if (starter == 1) {
        sendMessage(&quot;You have already claimed your starter kit!&quot;);
    }
}[/code]

You can also use a boolean for the same thing:

private boolean starter;
[code=java]
public void giveStarter() {
    if (starter == false) {
        addItem(4151, 1);
        addItem(11694, 1):

        starter == true;
        sendMessage(&quot;You have just received a start kit!&quot;);

    } else if (starter == true) {
        sendMessage(&quot;You have already claimed your starter kit!&quot;);
    }
}[/code]

<p>Your slightly correct, but I’m referring back to what I learnt in school. Parenthesis is the parent word.</p>

You can ask a gmod to clean the topic up and leave your posts so you can edit them and then you’ll have all of the tutorial in one line. Just pm one of them and I’m sure they’ll do something for you if everyone else is okay with having their posts removed.</p>

EDIT2: Mention sleeping a thread. Personally, I just sleep the Thread for a delay instead of doing your way. Like this:</p>
<p><code>
public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException {
      Thread.sleep(5000); // Makes a 5 second delay by milliseconds.
      System.out.println("It has been 5 seconds now: HELLO!!!"); // Prints out something.
}
      </code><br>
EDIT3: Mention String[] args can be changed to a different name like String[] tacos.</p>
<p>EDIT4: Tell them String[] args is the command line.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>To add. All you need to do and then you’re done.[/quote]</p>
<p>I added a brief on Thread.sleep but there’s so much to explain, totally missed out logical operators etc <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>[quote=“arham 4, post:6, topic:507649”]EDIT2: Mention sleeping a thread. Personally, I just sleep the Thread for a delay instead of doing your way. Like this:</p>
<p><code>
public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException {
      Thread.sleep(5000); // Makes a 5 second delay by milliseconds.
      System.out.println("It has been 5 seconds now: HELLO!!!"); // Prints out something.
}
      </code><br>
EDIT3: Mention String[] args can be changed to a different name like String[] tacos.</p>
<p>EDIT4: Tell them String[] args is the command line.[/quote]</p>
<p>To add. All you need to do and then you’re done.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Sup22211, post:2, topic:507649”]4 Things :<br>
1.You can explain to them that the “public void main(String[] args) {” basicly run the application and if you dont have it you cant run it. (maybe you did explain this but i didn’t see)<br>
2.Ah i see i gave you an idea whit the wait 5 seconds and then something will happen. Cool lol <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
3. add to your TODO list a “void” with parameters.<br>
4.Show them a simple switch statement like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void SwitchST(int num){
switch(num){
case 0:
System.out.println("The num is: 0");
break;
case 1:
System.out.println("The num is: 1");
break;
case 2:
System.out.println("The num is: 2");
break;
        }
}</code></pre>
<p>And more…[/quote]</p>
<p>I explained it somewhere.<br>
No you didn’t give me the idea<br>
switch statements are in  my TODO list (also your “simple” example is kinda crappy lol)</p>
<p>[quote=“Fire capez, post:3, topic:507649”]How this could be improved:<br>
Explain method return types (i.e void is a method with no return type)<br>
Explain the concept of a compiler error <span class="bbcode-s">and why a missing brace will print 100 errors.</span><br>
Explain operator precedence.<br>
Explain the ternary operator.<br>
Explain why different data types exist, i.e why have both byte and int?<br>
Explain the concept of an object.<br>
<span class="bbcode-s">Explain the concept of an IDE.</span><br>
Briefly explain the concept of bytecode and how compilation and interpretation actually works.[/quote]</p>
<p>I crossed out what I’m not going to do, but I’ll deffo take considerations on that list. Its just a big pain in the ass trying to give a good example and definition without going into some nerdy explanation which won’t make sense lol.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll be doing all sorts of requests if you guys want and i’ll do a thread update status too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: when i read through this again, I noticed some code errors which i’ll be fixing too!</p>
