    <title>A Java 2D Game Engine (JaGE)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-java-2d-game-engine-jage/342239</link>
    <description>Before I start, let me say I don&#39;t know jack shit about Java. All I did was downloaded an IDE, fired it up, and set a web page to Google. It was supposed to resemble my C# game engine.

Some things you should know:
-Java conventions are nowhere near perfect. I leaned towards C# on some (Although there&#39;s some things that break convention rules overall).
-Key press doesn&#39;t work worth shit. It&#39;s why I abandoned this project. Like I said, I don&#39;t know anything about Java, so I can&#39;t imagine why stuff happened like it did (Although I have an idea. From what I googled, Java GUIs have their own thread, which means I would have had to time things right, which I didn&#39;t want to do)
-Some things you might find messy. This is because I encountered a series of problems and got too lazy to clean up the experimented code. This includes unneeded imports.
-Some of you are gonna get all pissy cause there are some really small classes, but I had later plans for them (Like a scripting engine processor in the EventProcessor class that never got added) and don&#39;t feel like explaining them here.

So! This is a small game engine I made in about a day. It has regular and animated objects and some input stuff. You&#39;ll find the MapObject class is empty. It was going to be the object for maps that included views and its own objects. It&#39;s pretty fast. At an uncontrolled speed, I got over 100 FPS with 101 animated objects on the screen. Here&#39;s a screeny of what you&#39;ll find.

Nothin&#39; special, just thought I&#39;d post here. If (Ha, as if I&#39;m talking to anybody) anyone wants to use this, you don&#39;t need my permission or to give me credit. This was like a Google puzzle. I was just lucky enough to put the pieces together.

Overall it’s not as bad as you say but there are still some issues.</p>
<p>Your InputHandler isn’t written very well and I don’t understand why you need to keep track of every button pressed (You could have done this in a much simpler manner).<br>
I wouldn’t put a draw method in your GameObject class (which should be called Entity). It would better in your engine class.<br>

In other words, by default it allows a subclass to override it. Because of this, the compiler doesn’t force the override annotation upon you, though it is better practice. The annotation makes the compiler perform validation checks on whether that function is actually overriding a superclass’ function or not. This is useful in case you intended to override a function but mistakenly misspelled its name definition, or something similar.</p>
<p>I for one, have the bad habit of never using these annotations since I don’t expect myself to make a mistake while naming the function, but most Java developers will tell you to err on the side of caution and always implement it, as this also adds for code legibility.</p>

              <p>Overall it’s not as bad as you say but there are still some issues.</p>
<p>Your InputHandler isn’t written very well and I don’t understand why you need to keep track of every button pressed (You could have done this in a much simpler manner).<br>
I wouldn’t put a draw method in your GameObject class (which should be called Entity). It would better in your engine class.<br>
You’ve mentioned it yourself but you should really put all the class fields at the top of the class; this makes it so much easier to read.</p>

              <p>Before I start, let me say I don’t know jack shit about Java. All I did was downloaded an IDE, fired it up, and set a web page to Google. It was supposed to resemble my C# game engine.</p>
<p>Some things you should know:<br>
-Java conventions are nowhere near perfect. I leaned towards C# on some (Although there’s some things that break convention rules overall).<br>
-Key press doesn’t work worth shit. It’s why I abandoned this project. Like I said, I don’t know anything about Java, so I can’t imagine why stuff happened like it did (Although I have an idea. From what I googled, Java GUIs have their own thread, which means I would have had to time things right, which I didn’t want to do)<br>
-Some things you might find messy. This is because I encountered a series of problems and got too lazy to clean up the experimented code. This includes unneeded imports.<br>
-Some of you are gonna get all pissy cause there are some really small classes, but I had later plans for them (Like a scripting engine processor in the EventProcessor class that never got added) and don’t feel like explaining them here.</p>
<p>So! This is a small game engine I made in about a day. It has regular and animated objects and some input stuff. You’ll find the MapObject class is empty. It was going to be the object for maps that included views and its own objects. It’s pretty fast. At an uncontrolled speed, I got over 100 FPS with 101 animated objects on the screen. Here’s a screeny of what you’ll find.</p>
<p><img src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/4515/javafail.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Nothin’ special, just thought I’d post here. If (Ha, as if I’m talking to anybody) anyone wants to use this, you don’t need my permission or to give me credit. This was like a Google puzzle. I was just lucky enough to put the pieces together.</p>
