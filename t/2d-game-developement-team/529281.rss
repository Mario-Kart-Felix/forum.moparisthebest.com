[COLOR=#b22222][B][U]Welcome[/U][/B][/COLOR]
Hello people! I&#39;ve recently decided to begin a small development team
to program 2D games and sell them to different companies. I have already began
on a 2D side scrolling game. I&#39;ve created the first level with some enemies
and obviously the main character. I&#39;ve added health and fireballs. I have also
added a currency the fireballs. I have also recently created a point system.
This point system is earned by killing the enemies and at the end of each
level, you are able to purchase new abilities and power ups. I&#39;ve been having
great luck with this game.

[COLOR=#008000][B][U]What do I do?[/U][/B][/COLOR]
Well, to begin, my name is Kyle and I love to program. I usually program
using java. I love java. I&#39;ve created several RSPS&#39;s in my lifetime
and I have also had a lot of practice with java. I&#39;ve gotten help, I&#39;ve been
taught and I&#39;ve taken classes as I still am. I mainly program because I find it
fun and once I&#39;m done, I can&#39;t shake off the greatest feeling
of accomplishment. I also do Graphics, VB.net, and Video Editing.

[B][U][COLOR=#008000]What&#39;s this thread about?[/COLOR]
[/U][/B]I am creating this thread because I wouldn&#39;t mind a little help on programming
my games so progression go&#39;s faster and money is made quicker. I am looking
for a few people who are interested in joining my development team.
Sadly, it is only I and Andreas in the team. I do the programming and he
prefers to do some designing. I would love to introduce many more people
to the team. I am an outgoing guy and I do not have an uncontrolable temper.
I listen attentively and I take most ideas into consideration. I am not to strict about
deadlines although I do prefer things being atleast started when I ask.
[COLOR=#008000]
[/COLOR][B][U][COLOR=#008000]Who am I looking for?[/COLOR][/U][/B]
- 2 Java Programmers
- 2 Designer
- 2 HTML/CSS designer/programmer
- 2 &quot;Ideas Guy&quot;
- 3 Staff members for forums and website
- 1 Forums Creator and Hoster
- 1 Team Leader
- 1 Group Leader
That is what I do need so far.

[B][U][COLOR=#008000]How to apply for the team?[/COLOR]
[/U][/B]It is preferred to apply over Skype although I do accept applications over e-mail.
If you apply over e-mail, please let me know in the comments below this thread.

[B][U][COLOR=#008000]My [/COLOR][COLOR=#ffa500]availability[/COLOR] [COLOR=#008000]to program?[/COLOR]
[/U][/B]I am almost always available. I do have life to! All I&#39;m getting at is
I put a lot of time and effort into my work. I am in grade 13 and going
to university and getting into the trades. I am looking forward to becoming
a mechanic. I will also attempt to become a programmer for
PS3 and other gaming consoles.

I want to thank you for taking the time to read this thread.

<p>Craig takes his regular look at the desktop and mobile browser usage charts. While IE8 dropped below 10%, only Internet Explorer escaped unscathed from Chrome's regular rise.</p>

<blockquote>Browser Trends May 2013: IE8 Drops Below 10%</blockquote>
<p>It’s better to expect everyone to have a modern browser than to expect they have random browser plugins. Java is completely useless on the web nowadays so there’s no reason to expect anybody to have it. They’d most likely update their browser before downloading suspicious EXEs (referring to downloadable games).</p>

most companies are switching to html5. staying with old technologies is just going to hurt them in the long run. im not talking shit about java, im just saying you might as well be using new technology that is going to be a standard soon<br>
[/quote]if he’s making a browser based game sure html5 is a lot better than an applet, but who said he was? what I got out of this was he wanted to make a 2d java game and you guys are saying he should make a browser game instead[/quote]The web can just be used as another platform for games.</p>

<p>most companies are switching to html5. staying with old technologies is just going to hurt them in the long run. im not talking shit about java, im just saying you might as well be using new technology that is going to be a standard soon</p>

Did you really just imply that Javascript is better for 2D game development than Java, and that Java is outdated?<br>
You might not want to leave until you’re a bit less ignorant[/quote]JavaScript is a lot better for game development. Java on the client sucks for the most part.</p>
