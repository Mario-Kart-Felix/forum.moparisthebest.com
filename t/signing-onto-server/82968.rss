    <title>Signing Onto Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/signing-onto-server/82968</link>
    <description>well i&#39;ve been editing my new server for quite a while, and i think it was either yesterday or the day before that i started getting this problem.

:: lets say i log on, then i log off really quick, or log out 10 mins later, etc. it won&#39;t let me back on? it says no response from server, now im not really concerned if (I) myself can&#39;t get on, but other players, which i haven&#39;t tested out, but i still need to be on the server itself to make changes and etc.

i get this

[code]Starting Project X Scape on 0.0.0.0:43594
ClientHandler: Accepted Connection Fully
ClientHandler: Accepted from localhost:2738
Client type: low memory version
UserId: 4925389
teh x n00b is signing onto server.
LOADED: 0
[client-1-teh x n00b]: Case 130: 0
[client-1-teh x n00b]: Case 185: 9154
Game saved for player teh x n00b
ClientHandler: Client teh x n00b disconnected.
ClientHandler: Rejected localhost:2739
ClientHandler: Accepted from localhost:2739
[/code]

i really don&#39;t see whats wrong, no errors when i compile, when i run. i must of messed something up in player.java or client.java. so if anyone could help? i would appreciate it. =)</description>
