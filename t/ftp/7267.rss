    <title>Ftp..?</title>

    <description>I&#39;m going to make my own FTP server to share movies and other crap, so i was hoping that someone could tell me any good programs to manage my FTP, how to keep my FTP safe (only share the files i want to share), and other things like that :D

I havent made it yet but i found a program called CuteFTP, this is my first time making one, and yes i have searched but i would rather find out others peoples opinion on good software.

One more question the FTP will use my ip address right, is there any risk in that?

Thank You
