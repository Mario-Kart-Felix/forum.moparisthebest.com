{.include srl/srl.scar}

const
treecolor1=1138768;
timetochop=10000;

procedure chop;
begin
if(findcolorspiraltolerance(x,y,treecolor1,msx1,msy1,msx2,msy2,25))then
mmouse(x,y,3,3)
if(IsUpTextMulti(&#39;chop&#39;,&#39;op do&#39;,&#39;down&#39;))then
ClickMouse(3, 3, True)
begin
mouse(x,y,3,3,true)
end;
end;

procedure treewait;
begin
wait(timetochop)
end;


begin
cleardebug;
setupsrl;
activateClient;
repeat
treewait;
chop;
until(false)
end.




Well wanting help improving it like how to get it to drop logs after it gets them. Also wanting to know how to get it to chop only one specific tree(right now it&#39;ll chop any tree it sees...or try to atleast). Also it seems to wonder around and move to new areas to often so wanting help fixing that to because at the moment autoing behind varrok castle probably wouldn&#39;t work. Btw this is first script ive had any part in making so wasn&#39;t sure whether post here or script help so i posted here.[br][size=1]Posted on: April 11, 2007, 06:38:44 PM[/size][hr]Just noticed wrong forum can someone delete?
