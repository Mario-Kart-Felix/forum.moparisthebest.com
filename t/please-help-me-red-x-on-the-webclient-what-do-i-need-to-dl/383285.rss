    <description>Hey everyone I am paying $15 to anyone that helps me and gets this to work. Everytime I open a webclient on Runelocus it has a little red X at the top left of the webclient. I&#39;m not sure what this is, but if you have ANY ideas and it works, I&#39;ll pay you. Thanks.</description>
