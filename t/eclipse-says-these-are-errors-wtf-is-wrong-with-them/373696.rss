    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eclipse-says-these-are-errors-wtf-is-wrong-with-them/373696</link>
    <description>So, eclipse marks these lines in one of my server files, as an error.

If it helps..?

I&#39;ve tried everything, and this was the most recent fix I made. It&#39;s truly pissing me off-.-&#39;..

If this is a simple fix, and I just don&#39;t realize it, please don&#39;t flame or anything in your post it&#39;s the most annoying thing in the world to me. Kthx</description>

<p>Could you maybe stop going around the “server help” section, posting bowl shit answers and reiterating what the person above you posted? You are making your self seem like a complete moron by doing so. This is written in Eclipse, it basically tells you if you have written an error or not. There isn’t a need to compile.[/quote]<br>
My apologize<br>
I didn’t realize my posts were Spam<br>
It was an honest thing i posted</p>
<p>The coding looked fine to me.</p>
