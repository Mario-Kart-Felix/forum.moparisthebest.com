              <p>just above the “player array” (The part which Nashi has highlighted) will be a variable called “NumberOfPlayers” or something similar to that.</p>
<p>If you are only using 1 player, you have to change that number to 1.  if you are using 2, you have to change it to 2 etc.  If you say you are using 2 players, you must input data for 2 players.</p>
<p>This “NumberOfPlayers” number has to be equal to how many players you have setup in the DeclarePlayers procedure.</p>
<p>Also, please do not double post.  read the rules.</p>

Even though you didnt declare that many players, Even though you might declare 2 players, the player array starts at 0 so Players[0] is actually Player 1, make sure you delete any other Player stuff that you don’t need but be careful not to delete what you are using</p>
