    <title>New to RS, got a few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-to-rs-got-a-few-questions/332870</link>
    <description>Hi guys,

I&#39;m pretty new to RS in general and just had a few questions to ask about setting up a private server.
Although I&#39;ve never looked into RS before I&#39;m by no means new to the PS scene I&#39;ve currently got several others set up so I&#39;m not gonna be asking &quot;ZOmG SETS UP MY SERVER! PLZ HALP!!&quot; I&#39;m pretty confident on the whole getting the server running it&#39;s more the scene itself.
First off, what&#39;s the difference between 317 and 508 servers? I can see that these seem to be the two main types of server, I&#39;m assuming one is just an older version of RS than the other. If so does this mean that 317 servers are more stable than 508 or have 508 servers become stable now?
This leads me to ask what server package would people recommend? I&#39;m looking to set up a vanilla RS server with no fast skill areas and PK equipment, etc. Is there a decent package out there for this? If not what&#39;s the closest I could get?

Thanks in advance guys :).

P.S: Apologies if this is completely the wrong section for these questions.</description>

              <p>[quote=“12igon8, post:2, topic:332870”]I can answer a few…<br>
317 is older runescape (looks older than your grandma) and 508 is well…newer they are both coded very differently.<br>
there is also 344,503,517,525,544,562,582,594… 594 is the most current, i might be missing one but yea…</p>
<p>If your looking for stability then go for 317, but, there are more 317’s out then the rest and can be coded easier. But 508+ get more players easier but are harder to code. And the package thing, is called a source, and really its just choice.[/quote]</p>
<p>Your missing about 500 each time runescape updates its client, the revision changes. There are only about 6 or 7 popular client revisions though. 317, 377, 454, 474, 508, 525, 562, and 554. A 517 isn’t a revision, its simply a term used to describe a 508 client that loads 525 cache.</p>
<p>508s have actually become the most stable, mostly due to the fact that 317s are piled with so much junk that they become less stable. If your looking for a 317, go with Hyperion. If you want a 508+, Use rs2hd packaging. If you want good PvP though, use a Z508 base, its codeusa packaging.</p>
