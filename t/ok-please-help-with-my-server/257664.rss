              <p>if its portforwarding, here is a somewhat universal step…<br>
a. go to whatever your default gateway’s ip is in your browser…(common sense right…)<br>
b. sign in(belkin factory password is admin<br>
OR blank… can’t remember…)<br>
c.go to gaming part(forgot what its called on belkin)<br>
d.type in your default gateway in the boxes that say it…?<br>
[###][###][##][#]<br>
make sure you have…TCP marked not ucp or anything else thats up there… port is standard port unless you feel like being weird… 43594… or is it 43954…? idk always forget…<br>
(i was told to do this… idk if it helped…) anyways<br>
make a second one<br>
do the same thing<br>
lable port 5555…? and lable it game2(i used game1 as my rs2server name)<br>
now heres the fun part!!!<br>
click save!!<br>
if thats the problem then it should be fixed… if not heres another common problem…<br>
A.you don’t have enviormental variables set right… go to your path thingy and check the java on it…?<br>
B. enable the server and port in your allowances in firewall…<br>
(<a href="http://blahblah.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">blahblah.no-ip.org</a> or… <a href="http://blahblah.servegame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">blahblah.servegame.com</a> you get the point… your “no-ip’s” ip… and put the port you used for GAME 1 not the second… fun part again… save it!!! WOW!!! WE WELCOME TO MOPARSCAPE&gt;&gt;? if not message me we will get this shit done</p>
