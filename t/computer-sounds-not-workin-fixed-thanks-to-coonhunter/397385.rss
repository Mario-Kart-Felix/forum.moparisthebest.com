    <description>Hey everybody. Well today I started workin on my Zombie Arcadium game and I tried adding sounds so I ran the game and no sound came out. I checked all my volume controls and updated the drivers still nothing. Finally i took the computer apart to check to make sure a cable didnt get loose with the connectors but everything is fine. Any ideas? This is the error I get:

<p>Could be a bad sound card. I would, first, go into the device manager. Completely uninstall,your sound drivers. Grom tjere, reboot. If you have vista or 7, let it install. If you have xp, install it manually. If that doesnt work, you might need a new sound card.</p>
