    <description>Okay guys, 
So the other day i came along some sources sitting in my fucking hard drive while i was clearing it. These are amazingly OLD sources. Winterlove v1 was the first source released which started the foundation for Runescape Private Servers. Later on more of these servers came about such as HybridScape and Battlescape the original. So the first source i will be talking about is Winterlove v1:
I added a bit to it, i had added all the NPC&#39;s from the old runescape onto the server. Thats a lot of NPC&#39;s if you ask me.
All item prices have been modified to its original prices which are the same as the classical runescape. Staff making was included thanks to 3 people which will remain Anonymous until you go through the files to figure out. All shops have been modified to match the classical runescapes shops. Only skill(s) that is/are currently working will be the following: mining, runecrafting, fishing, farming, and cooking. More skills can be added, but i was lazy.
So here is the link, i did not take any images because i was busy fixing the 435 revision for release (NO IMAGES FOR EITHER SOURCES, go on to find out how its like)

Winterlove (Making the source)
iMod3rn (Adding all NPCS, fixing shops, fixing magic, fixing command order, fixing cooking, implementing real item prices, fixing certain skills)
__________________________
Onto the second source which is the 435 revision.
So this was amazingly hard to do because i had never worked with a source like this and it was hard to figure a lot of shit out, but after hours of practicing and going through files i figured out a lot.
So the features:
[code]- 7 skills done (Melee, Woodcutting, Mining, Fishing, Fletching, Magic, Prayer)
- Correct attacking methods
- Stability
- NPC Dialogue
- Almost perfect combat
- Player Saving
- Equiptment requirements
- New stats interface
- 100% Clan Chat
- 100% Censors
- Completely Anti-Flood.
- Three Connections Per IP
- Server Console
- Trading
- Private Message
- New Interfaces
- All NPC Drops
- Player Design
- ALL Hovering Stats
- Thread Per Client[/code]

Thats kind of all the features, but there may be some hidden ones :P.
I have also implemented the original shops taken from Winterlove v1 and revised them. So let me teach you guys some basics:

Making your self Owner/Admin/Mod
Go into the Config\Rights directory
Add your name to either admin list or mod list.
Note: Admin list is usually Owner list so...

Changing name of server and welcome message
Go into Config directory
Then open up the &quot;Server.ini&quot; file and edit the options.

To change objects or shops, just go through the Config directory and you will find it.
To change the server port which is set to 9000, go to src\com\rs\worldserver\ and open Constants.java
