The name Infexo came from one of my earliest alias&#39;s, in which I used very frequently on forums, sites, and private servers. Later on I became fond of this name, and decided to use it for other purposes, namingly gaming sites, forums, ect. I have decided to go ahead and use this name as it&#39;s unique, and just has the ring to it that all successful websites need to have. At the moment this server idea is still a work in progress, and I haven&#39;t yet set my heart on going ahead with it. But that is where you come in, of course! I&#39;m in need of a team of around 3-5 to assist me in starting and finishing this project. I chose to start it now as I&#39;m away from school for around 6-7 weeks from next week, so that gives me/us more than enough time to get things organised and make a start. I need an intelligent team of experienced coders, graphic artists &amp; a number of other jobs that will need filling up. I will read through any applications carefully and chose the strongest 3-5 of the applicants. One of the most important attributes of any application will be fluent English, as well as proper grammar and spelling, along with professionalism and experience. Please fill out any applications carefully to increase your chance of acceptance.
