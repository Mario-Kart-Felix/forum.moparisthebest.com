    <description>What do you guys think?

I&#39;m not religious. IMO, I think when you die you just die. Body rots away back to the earth. I wonder though how does it feel to be nothing? Scary, isn&#39;t it...</description>

I have nothing against you if you do believe in re-incarnation, I just think it is a little bit improbable. (It could happen one day though :D)</p>

<p>I presume you are ‘Christian’ and trying to be smart. Lemme clarify a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are Protestant (or Mormon [heaven’s no!]), and therefore have very twisted information.</li>
<li>If you ARE ‘Christian’ and you sincerely think what you said is what the Holy Fathers taught, then you are truly wrong. It was <span class="bbcode-u">never</span> taught in the Church that you will die, and the “see an angel”. Actually, no one in the Church knows what happens after you die. It is all speculation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, I know what happens after you die: WHO. THE. FUCK. CARES.</p>

<p>I believe that when you die, your soul will float upwards to heaven. Yes, everyone, towards heaven. Not everyone will go to heaven though. Theres a “gulf” and on one side of the gulf is everyone who made it to heaven. The other side, is the people who did not. They will wait there to be judged. If they do not win the “appeal” they will be sentenced to hell.</p>
<p>Now, I dont want anyone thinking im crazy and gods going to walk out onto the stand to lawyer music. When I say “get judged”, I mean God will decide what their punishment will be.</p>
<p>So, all in all, everything could be wrong, and everything might happen like in a different religion. Possibly, no one will be right. No one knows yet. But there ‘might’ come a day everyone will know.</p>
<p>I just know that Ive had miracles happen to me. And the bible was written so long ago. How could they have predicted the outcome of our future?</p>
<p>EDIT: Btw, just because Im catholic, does NOT mean I believe everything I say. What I get from the bible is closest to their teachings.</p>

              <p>I’m Wiccan. It’s a neo-pagan religion with duality. I believe when you die, you go to Summerland to await a new body for your soul to take. In each life your soul learns new lessons, and the rule of three (known as karma) takes effect. Bad things that happen to good people, their past lives were dicks, and vice-versa. Then, when your soul has been self taught everything, you die and live with the God and Goddess. Summerland is a wonderful place. Everyone goes there, no matter what you believe in. It’s not like heaven, you can do what ever you want, and make it what ever you want.</p>

              <p>I believe, that, me being a christian, a Methodist, that. When you die, if you take God as your saviour, and that has died for your sins, that you will go to heaven, to be one of his disciples. And if you are not a believer, or you don’t repent, and you’re blasphemous, then you will suffer in the torments of Hell for all eternity. But, that’s just me, and that’s in a nutshell, I wrote a 15 pg. persuasive paper to my English Teacher on why it is so important to repent. And don’t smash me about this, I just believe that you go to heaven if you meet the criteria, how you literally get to heaven, I don’t know.</p>
