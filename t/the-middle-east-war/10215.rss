    <title>The Middle East war</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-middle-east-war/10215</link>
    <description>I need to find out how and why it started.

Apparently the teacher said it goes much much deeper than just the kidnappings commited by the lebanease

Also another theory I heard about the war is that America is funding the war both ways, is this true?</description>
