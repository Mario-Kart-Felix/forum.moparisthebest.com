    <title>Eros Online - Looking for Developers/Programmers ASAP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eros-online-looking-for-developers-programmers-asap/443714</link>
    <description>[center][IMG]http://i94.photobucket.com/albums/l109/sora4445/NewLogo.png[/img][/center]

Still the same logo, and still the same owner. ;) Except iXm is not longer with me on my project. And I am not longer working on my runescape remake at the moment. But it&#39;ll be part of a side project that I will be working on. But not as much as our main server.

I currently host a decent server, while I code my alpha/beta server that is not released to the public. And i&#39;m looking for programmers/developers to help with the Eros Online project.

What needs to be done with the server.

[code]Thieving is easily autoclickable

After doing a skill, such as Firemaking/Woodcutting, it doesn&#39;t stop it&#39;s animation.

Firemaking doesn&#39;t make a fire, it just moves a position without making the fire.

Summoning on an Obelisk seems much more better, than using items on a pouch. So adding the Obelisk for summoning in the donatorzone since it&#39;s going to be a skill for Donators only.

Donator teleport on quest tab takes player to empty ice mountain (::dzone is how to get to donor zone) (ty Co-Owner Z)

Players can wear skillcapes whether they have 99 or not in the specific skill

A lot of skills are not animated

Door to cooking range does not open, but you can cook through the wall. (without opening door with fishing)

Buying items from shops only allows buy 10 each time, max. (will take ages to buy arrows, shards, runes...)

NPC&#39;s drops are not working. =\
[/code]

And what I expect to get out of this server.

A fully working decent server. I plan on changing the home to somewhere, a little bit more &#39;suitable&#39; for a home. I personally think Lumbridge, EdgeVille, Falador, and Varrock are over used and not enough people are looking hard enough to put a home. If you ask me, I don&#39;t want to give away a location, since I haven&#39;t found one. But my team of Mods/Admins/Owners are looking all over the map trying to find a place that we haven&#39;t really &#39;seen&#39; used. Camelot is used alot for things like Cammy PvP. And I want SOME pvp, but not full. I want an eco, and I want pvp. So if you think of it, it&#39;s more of an Eco pvp server. The server I currently am coding, I fixed up SLIGHTLY. But it still needs far more work than I expected out of it. But this is why I am trying to find a decent programmer/Developer, to help get this released, so that the players of Eros Online can have something decent to play unlike some of the newly made servers, that are leeched and poorly programmed. =\ If you think of it, I kind of don&#39;t want to be in the position alot of other poorly developers. 

Some pictures I suppose

Home for now. Will be changing for sure!

Our shops for now. Will be moving them with the home. :)
[IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/bbn2t.png[/img]
Broken animation for woodcutting.. =\
[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/25svt3r.png[/img]
Broken animation for Firemaking and it not making a fire =\
[IMG]http://i47.tinypic.com/avg5co.png[/img]
And our last problem... When unarmed is there. &#39;Block&#39; is Attack, &#39;Kick&#39; is Defence, and &#39;Punch&#39; is Strength. Fixing this would help out alot! Also having the correct animations for them would help out greatly!
[IMG]http://i50.tinypic.com/292mwm0.jpg[/img]


That&#39;s about all I can really provide that&#39;s really there. If there is anything else I need to cover please let me know.. I need all the help I can get with the server, this way it can be developed greatly and not poorly. But as always, use this application to apply for Programmer/Developer.

Name:
Age:
Experience[Show proof, not some fake stuff.]:
How many years have you programmed?[If you say you&#39;re 14, and tell me 8 years. I find it hard to believe you did.]
Why you feel helping out Eros Online can help you:
Why should I Eros/Demon accept you as our Programmer/Developer?:
Would you be able to program my server without all these problems it currently has?:
Would you be active, or are you just going to bail out after fixing, maybe one thing?:
Are you commited to stay even if you find another project to work on?:

That&#39;s all for the applications I suppose, may add more to it. :)</description>

<p>THANK YOU FOR AGREEING WITH ME! I agree with you on the 317 as well. I just used this one, because it looked alright to me, and didn’t seem like alot of work. My main goal, is fixing the drops. Because my drops are fucked! DX</p>

<p>Still the same logo, and still the same owner. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Except iXm is not longer with me on my project. And I am not longer working on my runescape remake at the moment. But it’ll be part of a side project that I will be working on. But not as much as our main server.</p>
<p>I currently host a decent server, while I code my alpha/beta server that is not released to the public. And i’m looking for programmers/developers to help with the Eros Online project.</p>
<p>What needs to be done with the server.</p>
<p>[code]Thieving is easily autoclickable</p>
<p>After doing a skill, such as Firemaking/Woodcutting, it doesn’t stop it’s animation.</p>
<p>Firemaking doesn’t make a fire, it just moves a position without making the fire.</p>
<p>Summoning on an Obelisk seems much more better, than using items on a pouch. So adding the Obelisk for summoning in the donatorzone since it’s going to be a skill for Donators only.</p>
<p>Donator teleport on quest tab takes player to empty ice mountain (::dzone is how to get to donor zone) (ty Co-Owner Z)</p>
<p>Players can wear skillcapes whether they have 99 or not in the specific skill</p>
<p>A lot of skills are not animated</p>
<p>Door to cooking range does not open, but you can cook through the wall. (without opening door with fishing)</p>
<p>Buying items from shops only allows buy 10 each time, max. (will take ages to buy arrows, shards, runes…)</p>
<p>NPC’s drops are not working. =<br>
[/code]</p>
<p>And what I expect to get out of this server.</p>
<p>A fully working decent server. I plan on changing the home to somewhere, a little bit more ‘suitable’ for a home. I personally think Lumbridge, EdgeVille, Falador, and Varrock are over used and not enough people are looking hard enough to put a home. If you ask me, I don’t want to give away a location, since I haven’t found one. But my team of Mods/Admins/Owners are looking all over the map trying to find a place that we haven’t really ‘seen’ used. Camelot is used alot for things like Cammy PvP. And I want SOME pvp, but not full. I want an eco, and I want pvp. So if you think of it, it’s more of an Eco pvp server. The server I currently am coding, I fixed up SLIGHTLY. But it still needs far more work than I expected out of it. But this is why I am trying to find a decent programmer/Developer, to help get this released, so that the players of Eros Online can have something decent to play unlike some of the newly made servers, that are leeched and poorly programmed. =\ If you think of it, I kind of don’t want to be in the position alot of other poorly developers.</p>
<p>Some pictures I suppose</p>
<p>Home for now. Will be changing for sure!<br>

Our shops for now. Will be moving them with the home. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

Broken animation for woodcutting… =<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i49.tinypic.com/25svt3r.png" title="25svt3r.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/25svt3r.png" alt width="690" height="455"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div><br>
Broken animation for Firemaking and it not making a fire =<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i47.tinypic.com/avg5co.png" title="avg5co.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i47.tinypic.com/avg5co.png" alt width="690" height="453"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div><br>
And our last problem… When unarmed is there. ‘Block’ is Attack, ‘Kick’ is Defence, and ‘Punch’ is Strength. Fixing this would help out alot! Also having the correct animations for them would help out greatly!<br>

</div></a></div></p>
<p>That’s about all I can really provide that’s really there. If there is anything else I need to cover please let me know… I need all the help I can get with the server, this way it can be developed greatly and not poorly. But as always, use this application to apply for Programmer/Developer.</p>
<p>Name:<br>
Age:<br>
Experience[Show proof, not some fake stuff.]:<br>
How many years have you programmed?[If you say you’re 14, and tell me 8 years. I find it hard to believe you did.]<br>
Why you feel helping out Eros Online can help you:<br>
Why should I Eros/Demon accept you as our Programmer/Developer?:<br>
Would you be able to program my server without all these problems it currently has?:<br>
Would you be active, or are you just going to bail out after fixing, maybe one thing?:<br>
Are you commited to stay even if you find another project to work on?:</p>
<p>That’s all for the applications I suppose, may add more to it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
