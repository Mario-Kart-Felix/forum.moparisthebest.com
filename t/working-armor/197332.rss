    <title>Working armor?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/working-armor/197332</link>
    <description>I have all the bonuses set for the armor, but players still hit just as often on other players as they would without armor. How can I make armour make people actually hit less often?


Oh and which .java do i modify?  People are saying client.java otheres player.java or playerhander etc.  So which one?

Thanks for  taking the time to read  ;D</description>
