    <title>Ip server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ip-server/402907</link>
    <description>Welcome
I have a problem, I want to make runescape private server, but here I encountered on a couple of problems.
I would like to make a server so that other people / friends can play along with me.
I do not know where to set the ip of my server (no-ip.biz for example), how to run servers, I can I go to him, but I give the client a colleague, he can no longer enter.
It is very important to me, everything I was looking now how to set ip SERVER, not the client. Here on the forum can be tutorial, but I can not find it, if someone is willing to help please drop off by writing or links to tutorials
Thanks in advance</description>
