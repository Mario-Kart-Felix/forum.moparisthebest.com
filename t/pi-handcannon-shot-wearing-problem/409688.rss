    <title>[PI] handcannon shot wearing problem!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-handcannon-shot-wearing-problem/409688</link>
    <description>Hi,

I got 2 problems with handcannon shots.

1. When I spawn it doesnt spawn like all arrows in total amount but per item in my invetory. So when I spawn 28 of them it doesnt show 1 handcannon shot with 28 amount on it but it spawns in mine whole invetory.

2. When I wear it, It wears in full helm case. I already added 15243 at itemassistant by arrows but it doesn&#39;t give a result.

Please give me any tip ??</description>
