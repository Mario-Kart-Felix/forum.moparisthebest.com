    <title>Cyclist/Pedestrian Surveyor Software</title>

    <description>Hi guys.

I wrote this today for a colleague. It&#39;s designed for use by engineers and other procurement personnel in transport for the purpose of surveying stretches of road for bicycle and pedestrian use. This would then inform the prioritisation of cycleways that are to be constructed (among other things).

I figured I&#39;d share it as it contains a variety of interesting things that university-level students currently studying C# would find useful. This includes WPF, use of the MVVM design pattern (using the MVVMLight API), use of Dapper and SQL Server 2012 LocalDB, etc.

Here&#39;s the link: [url=https://github.com/Lothy/cyclist-surveyor]https://github.com/Lothy/cyclist-surveyor[/url]

It requires the .NET framework version 4.5.1 or higher and Microsoft SQL Server 2012 LocalDB to be installed.</description>
