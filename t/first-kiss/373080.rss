    <title>First Kiss</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/first-kiss/373080</link>
    <description>Okay to start off, I&#39;m 14. So yeah.

I just now, like 10 minutes ago, got my first kiss.

It wasn&#39;t like a kiss, but like a make out, sort of. It was 10 seconds long.

I think I did a horrible fucking job of kissing her, so any advice about kissing is appreciated. This thread is also about discussing your first kiss.

Also, is it a bad thing that I posted this here before telling anyone I know IRL?</description>

<p>Forsure man. The best thing that ever happened to me personally for dealing with girls is when I started being completely direct with them.

<p>And I don’t mean direct where you be an asshole and just walk up to a girl and say “Wanna fuck?” Although I have heard success stories with that technique. But direct where you don’t waste time and don’t play games. Leave that stuff for the women to do, god knows they love to.[/quote]</p>
<p>Loled. My friends and i were playing truth or dare (cause were cool like that) and i dared him to say “Wanna Fuck?” to this really hot chick. He went and asked and ended up getting lucky that night… It was halarious.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice. I was a huge pussy and to scared to make a move, so she made the move for the kiss, lol.</p>
<p>[quote=“orcashark, post:86, topic:373080”]I got my first kiss at the age of 11, and made out my first time when i was 13. Im actually still with the girl i first made out with now and im 15. Ill give you some tips,<br>
Try not to breathe too hard through your nose while you do, i know its hard but itl make the moment feel better.<br>
ALWAYS keep your eyes closed until its over.<br>
When your backing away, back off slowly, dont just pull away, cause then she will think she did something wrong.<br>
Try to just nibble, and if your feeling confident, try to tickle her lips very gently with your tongue, if she doesnt do anything then stop doing it, if she responds try to have fun with your tongues.[/quote]</p>
