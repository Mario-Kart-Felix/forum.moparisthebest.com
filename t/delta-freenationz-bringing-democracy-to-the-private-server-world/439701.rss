    <description>Sup all its Disastercall

ok so basically about the democracy thing im planning on making different positions for players, not staff but a whole new thing and to be into that position you have to be elected by staff members, and people. Same thing for staff, staff have to be elected and approved by the main administrators.

This is a skilling server mainly but it also has Pk and Dueling

ok so what i did so far

Finished:

Almost all the skills
Prayer (70% done) 

Home
Pk 
Duel 
Custom minigame 
Main fighting areas 
Gambling npc
Shops and all the basic things

client:

HD full screen 

Almost done:

Awesome jail system ( I got the idea from another post it its basically a jury, so who ever came up with that tutorial i guess 70% credits, im going to make the entire thing myself i wont be using his codes)
Custom items more like props like cigerates and etc.. XD


Ill add pictures as soon as i finish the jail
