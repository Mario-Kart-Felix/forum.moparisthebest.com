    <title>Looking for someone who can host a extra sunscape server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-someone-who-can-host-a-extra-sunscape-server/9199</link>
    <description>Hello,
Im the owner of sunscape. A populair private server. (For more info about it check the link in my sig)
But the current hosting cannont handle more then 50 players. So we need a extra hosting so when the current server is full. People can play on the extra server.
[b]What i want[/b]
- A Hosting who is 24/7/365
- Remote access or a other way to controll the server
- A good internet connection. Server must could handle at least 20 players without lag
- Its would be very nice if it is a real server. so not a home pc.
[b]What you get[/b]
- Owner rights on the server
- So you can spawn everything you want
- (r)ep of course
- Maybe more. Whe will talk about that (think about things like advertisment on the server)</description>

              <p>Dont give ure source to anywone most of these guys just want youre source to ripp it off and leech the codes no what you neeed to do is change the port of ure second server so that the other port is 50000 and people can join it by editing the port in moparscape 3 it will stay the same ip but a new port and another server</p>
<p>and how do i do this ? well that easy open you’re  server.java search for <code>serverlistenerPort </code> now change the number after it to 50000 save compile and rune 2 servers at the same time ;p</p>
