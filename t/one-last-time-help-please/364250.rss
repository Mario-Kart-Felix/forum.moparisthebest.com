    <description>Ok im not asking for you to do anything for me just state what I might not of done or might of done wrong... Ok so when i go to canyouseeme.org it says it cant find port 43594, I have went to portforward.com chosen my router, and did the step they said to do, my ip on ipconfig says 192.168.2.2 ( which is odd to me) but my whatismyip.com says its 206.225.77.66, i cannot use this with my router to portforward, my router automatically gives me the default 192.168.2.*, all it lets me do is change the last number. I do not have any antivirus software on my computer, nor do I have my firewall enabled. My server port is 43594 I have checked.. I have also checked my port when im running the server and when im not running the server.. Still get the same results. Can someone think of anything else I might have skipped over?</description>
