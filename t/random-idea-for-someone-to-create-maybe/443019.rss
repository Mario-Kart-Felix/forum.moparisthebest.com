    <description>is it possible to make a dueling option were you can run around and duel instead of just standing there..

also, i think someone you make range available in fighting mode.

i would try this but i have a fair bit more to learn, would rather learn then leech i guess.</description>

I think that was implemented in RSCAftermath. There were a lot of problems with having deathmatches anywhere though.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Only if it’s programmed poorly really.[/quote]Yeah in RSCA it was. But I think there were a few other problems as well that would take time to fix and implement. IMO it’s just a lot better having DM in an arena rather than just doing it anywhere. I imagine that’s why Jagex just had dueling without the ability to leave combat.</p>
