    <description>I&#39;d just like to make it clear that I did get this site approved by a Moderator.
[quote=&quot;Miss Silabsoft&quot;]approved.[/quote]

I bought a domain and turned it into a helping community. Similar to this, but less rules to abide by.

Ok, well, my friend and I decided to start a new Coding Community, that has everything to do with coding. Not just RuneScape Private Servers. Java, C++, C#, Graphic Design, everything... lol Pwnd is hosting it for us, so many credits go to him! Thank you Pwnd

Here, you can also advertise your servers and post any tutorials you want, unless it&#39;s leeched.
You can get help very easy here, with anything that you need.

[b]*Note*[/b] - [i]You do have to Register in-order to view the boards. This is to keep out guests that only want to leech.[/i]


I guess that explains most parts, so here&#39;s the link/s.

[url=http://www.codersrus.org]Main Site[/url]
[url=http://www.codersrus.org/smf]Forums[/url]

There is a forums link on the Main Page, I just thought it&#39;d be easier to post both urls for everyone.


Thank you,
