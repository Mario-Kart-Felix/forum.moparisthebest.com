    <description>Hey Guys,

I&#39;m using a devolution 7.0 server source and currently have working herblore. But now i would like to take it one step further by having working potions. I would really like it to raise your level by 5 and decrease slowly but i cant work out how to do that (code would be great). So i made a code that make it give you xp and decrease slowly. I am having trouble with this code as i dont know how to remove the exsisting potion although i have worked out how to additem (dose 2). Also i don&#39;t know how to make the experience slowly decrease. Here&#39;s the code:

[CODE]			case 121:
				setAnimation(0x33D);
				animationReset = System.currentTimeMillis() + 750;
				addSkillXP(1000, 0);
				addItem(123, 1); 
				sendMessage(&quot;You Drink The Attack Potion!&quot;);
				break;





All help is appreciated :)

Thanx[/code]</description>
