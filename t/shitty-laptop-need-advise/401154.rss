    <title>Shitty laptop, need advise</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shitty-laptop-need-advise/401154</link>
    <description>Ok guys, basicly I have this shitty Acer laptop that cost me 900 euros (payed only 500 because it was the last one they had and was used for demo (BEHIND A GLASS WALL so people didn&#39;t touch it) + I bought it 2 years ago and it has Blu-ray). And thing is exact a year ago, the laptop was pertotal, the keyboard had random turn off times, the card reader slot was jammed, the DVD/Blu-ray Drive was not detected by my BIOS, and eventually, the laptop got stuck in a boot loop. Basicly, Acer is shitty, really shitty. Now, I took it to a service repair a year ago, and they fixed it up, made it new again. However exactly one year later, now, I&#39;m running into problems again, it&#39;s not so bad as it used to be though.


Basicly, everytime I leave the laptop for like 2-3 hours shutted down, it can&#39;t boot in one time, so basicly, when I boot it after those hours of being shut down it starts and completing half the windows loading screen, the processor shuts down and the screen freezes. I have to hold the power button down and after like maximum 3 times freezing, it boots like a charm. Now this is in no way a software issue, I had this on my last Windows 7, thought it was due to fucked up system files that didn&#39;t allow my laptop to shut down correctly and thus, it not being able to boot in one time. Now, I did a clean install and I still have the problem, yes all my drivers are up to date.


The way I see it, my processor or another hardware wants to warm up? before it can start. Because of the fact that after a couple of times booting it boots eventually.


Let&#39;s say if I reboot now, no problem because I think the processor is still warm.


I&#39;m a pretty advanced tech guy and I know my processors and my building computer skills, but I haven&#39;t seen this before.


Also, I can&#39;t take it to a repair center because fucked up Acer has only one year warranty.</description>

</aside>
<p>I was going to suggest disabling the fan through the BIOS just to see if that’s causing the computer to get stuck in a boot loop, I once had the same problem with a computer at work and the solution to it was replacement of fan and cooling systems as they where under cooling. Processor was at something like 4 degrees. This was back a few years ago, technology has enhanced since then.[/quote]I like your way of thinking, undercooling, the thing is, first of all, this problem is recent, I’ve had this thing for 2 years now, Acer laptops are know for overheating not undercooling. Second of all, the fan starts working when the computer starts to actully use some processing power, so before the computer is fully booted, the fan is idle.<br>
I know, it’s not normal, but what do you got to do? It’s Acer.</p>
<p>Thanks for trying though.</p>

<p>That and all the other poor Acer owners made me realize that I should’off bought an Asus laptop, and it made me see how shitty Acer actully is.<br>

<p>my acer runs perfectly fine, and i use it almost 24/7.[/quote]Look, I took it apart, not completely, I took the hard drive out because I had to make some space for his other hard drive, after I managed to connect his other hard drive, I reinstalled the original hard drive, installing a hard drive is not rocket science and as I said, I have built computers many times before.</p>

              <p>Ok guys, basicly I have this shitty Acer laptop that cost me 900 euros (payed only 500 because it was the last one they had and was used for demo (BEHIND A GLASS WALL so people didn’t touch it) + I bought it 2 years ago and it has Blu-ray). And thing is exact a year ago, the laptop was pertotal, the keyboard had random turn off times, the card reader slot was jammed, the DVD/Blu-ray Drive was not detected by my BIOS, and eventually, the laptop got stuck in a boot loop. Basicly, Acer is shitty, really shitty. Now, I took it to a service repair a year ago, and they fixed it up, made it new again. However exactly one year later, now, I’m running into problems again, it’s not so bad as it used to be though.</p>
<p>Basicly, everytime I leave the laptop for like 2-3 hours shutted down, it can’t boot in one time, so basicly, when I boot it after those hours of being shut down it starts and completing half the windows loading screen, the processor shuts down and the screen freezes. I have to hold the power button down and after like maximum 3 times freezing, it boots like a charm. Now this is in no way a software issue, I had this on my last Windows 7, thought it was due to fucked up system files that didn’t allow my laptop to shut down correctly and thus, it not being able to boot in one time. Now, I did a clean install and I still have the problem, yes all my drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>The way I see it, my processor or another hardware wants to warm up? before it can start. Because of the fact that after a couple of times booting it boots eventually.</p>
<p>Let’s say if I reboot now, no problem because I think the processor is still warm.</p>
<p>I’m a pretty advanced tech guy and I know my processors and my building computer skills, but I haven’t seen this before.</p>
<p>Also, I can’t take it to a repair center because fucked up Acer has only one year warranty.</p>
