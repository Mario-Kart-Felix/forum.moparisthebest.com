    <title>Help with adding models command [will REP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-adding-models-command-will-rep/321219</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;I found this command was extremely helpful when adding models, i would of found it impossible to make my 317 HD without this command.
So i am going to share it with you, full credits to Deltascape.

Ok, open up your client.java client side.

On edit, press find, or hit ctrl + f, and search this.
Code:
model

There, you will probably see a command similar to this one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


I found this VERY VERY helpful guide http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363483.0.html and my server doesn&#39;t have the add model command. So I opened client.java and trl+f and typed &quot;model&quot; just like it said to. But it takes me no where. What should I do?</description>
