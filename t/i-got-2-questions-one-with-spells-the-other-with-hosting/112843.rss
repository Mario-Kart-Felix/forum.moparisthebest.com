    <title>I got 2 Questions, one with spells the other with hosting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-got-2-questions-one-with-spells-the-other-with-hosting/112843</link>
    <description>I would like to know if it is possible to make a spell Admin-only. If so please tell me how also. Another thing I would like to know is how to change which I.P your server starts on. I got himachi but my server always runs on 0.0.0.0 so I cant put it on the server list. If you can answer both, I might consider making you a mod or an admin.</description>
