My favorite songs in order -
1: Sleepwalking
2: House Of Wolves
3: Shadow Moses
4: Go To Hell, For Heaven&#39;s Sake

I really like it and feel Oliver found his voice, he isn&#39;t like he used to be like 04-07 but hes been trying different screams and I think this is a good fit for the band. He wasn&#39;t too emotional in this album though, was expecting more emotion like with &quot;Blessed With a Curse&quot;.</description>

I think the album is a lot better than his past ones in total, I love it and so far I like all the songs (so far).</p>
<p>Also, the reason he is doing different things with his screams is because he’s stressing out his voice a lot, and he has to sound like he is now (at least that’s what I’ve heard, don’t keep up with the band that much).<br>

The only song I wasn’t fond of was antivist. Yeah about his stressing his voice thing, I saw on youtube comments that he like sipped on detergent to make his screams better before a concert, Not sure if its true.[/quote]<br>
Artists who scream/growl, usually gargle salt water. That’s probably what that person meant because drinking detergent could kill you and or make your internal organs extremely hurt.</p>
<p>OP: I like their new album but, there could be a bit more screaming. I’d also like for them to go a big harder. They’ve gotten a lot lighter since their Count Your Blessings album. Maybe a notch down from that album would be nice.</p>
