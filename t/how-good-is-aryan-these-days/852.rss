    <title>How good is aryan these days?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-good-is-aryan-these-days/852</link>
    <description>For some reason in the last few days, I&#39;ve been such a noob. Anyways:

I havn&#39;t used aryan since a month or two before the mass ban. And with sbot3 taken down, my friend can&#39;t afford to pay for our server, plus I already owe him a few hundred dollars. So I am planning on dusting off aryan, and start using it again to get some cash. 

The last time I used it, I was able to make all 12 accounts last for nearly a month, and I&#39;d be making a few mill a day. I doubt it&#39;s gonna go like that anymore, so I thought I&#39;d ask, how long do your accounts last for, if your not using a proxy or anything? Or basically I need to be a bit more informed on aryan again, since I havnt used it for so many month&#39;s. If someone could point me in the right direction like a tutorial on using the proxies, or anything else I&#39;m going to need, that would be much appreciated =)</description>

</aside>
<p>Dsl = My Ip changes everytime I re-connect. I dont mind getting IP banned at all, but I do have a question, Does using a proxy reduce the chance of them banning your account? As long as my accounts can last a few days, then I dont mind. I can even use a few computer’s to trade my items over.</p>
