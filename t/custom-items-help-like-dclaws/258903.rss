              <p>you will need to find the INTS and the MODELS. once you do, open your Class8.java in your client, and search attack cape. (I do anyway, so much faster =p), hit enter after the }, then paste the INTS after. Now you MUST compile now, before adding the models. Then copy the models and paste them into your Model folder in your client folder. Make sure it has a number and ends with .gz (example:: 17777.gz) Run your server and client, then type <code> add model ****</code> (replace the **** with the number of the model). Log out, then back in, and pickup the item. it should work now. =]</p>
