    <title>[PI] Shop buy back price!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-shop-buy-back-price/411576</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I want to make it so when you bought a item from the shop the shop only buys it back for 90% of the price you&#39;ve payed. This to not have people buying a gear, using it and being able to just sell it back without making any loss.

Thank you,
