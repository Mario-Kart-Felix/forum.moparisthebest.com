    <title>Senior is that it..? (how about a vote)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/senior-is-that-it-how-about-a-vote/336886</link>
    <description>I have just been wondering and thought of how the posting is.. Ok so you have Junior member 
And then member and then you have Senior member..? is that it...? no more rankings from there... in my opinion there should be a few more ranks you lose interest after you reach 100 post.. only having 100 post and bam that&#39;s it you have maxed out (sounds abit like a rsps with ::max and your done..

Come on moparscape bring out some more ranks and make it so there is a goal to get..</description>
