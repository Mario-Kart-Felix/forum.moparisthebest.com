              <p>When you have no-ip downloaded, click the no-ip sign and turn your server on. If that doesn’t work, you may have to log into your router or modem. The same thing happened to me the other day, but i got my server to run. I hope i helped.</p>

              <p>You probably messed up on portforwarding, it can be quite confusing. I have a tut on easy portforwarding, but its not on this forums so not 100% sure if i can post. Also, please go to Develepoment/Help section, and post your questions there.</p>
