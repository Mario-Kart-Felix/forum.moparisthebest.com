    <title>You win an award</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/you-win-an-award/202109</link>
    <description>I was thinking, if there was a rule, where if your award was damaged or tainted, for instance, you win an award for fattest person on earth and you lose weight, therefor you lose your award.
Say you won an award for not winning an award, you end up winning a reward, so you lose it. But then you get it back, but then you lose it. 
So what would happen.</description>

Well, you could have “fattest person of 2007” and it would still apply if you weren’t fat anymore because you were the fattest at the time.  Although if it was the fattest person, then you would lose your title if someone passed you in fatness.</p>
<p>Why did you that?</p>
