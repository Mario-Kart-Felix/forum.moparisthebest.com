Expected PK Server Features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~Perfect Switching and PKing
~Curses
~Korasi
~Working Specs
~Barrows Armors
~Bandos
~Armadyl
~Dragon Claws
~Godswords

Easy-to-Access Equipment Via Shops
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can get all of your basic and most of your advanced PKing equipment through our various shops in-game!


Cash for Kills System
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike other PK-based servers, you don&#39;t just spawn expensive items at no cost, making every item in the game worthless. You start with a little bit of money for purchasing necessary items such as food and potions, or semi-advanced weaponry like the Saradomin sword or items of that sort. The main source of actual profit is PKing. As a regular player, you gain 2m cash per kill(cpk). However, if you donate, depending on how much you donate, your cpk is increased based on your level of donator. If you go on killstreaks, your cpk will increase with every kill or two in a row that you gain.


PvP Tokens for Kills
---------------------------------------------------------------
For every kill that you gain, you also receive 400k PvP tokens, which you can use in the PvP shop to purchase items such as Torva, Pernix, Virtus, chaotics, goliath/swift/and spellcaster gloves, and more! The amount of these received from kills also increases with donation rank!


Upgradable Items
-----------------------------------------------------------
Along with your cash and PvP tokens that you gain, you will also receive a million upgrade tokens for every kill that you achieve in the wild. This does not increase for donators. Once you save enough of these tokens, or purchase enough from other players for the correct price, you can use them to upgrade items such as dragon claws or the armadyl godsword. You could upgrade a piece of bandos or a set if you had enough! And much more!


Special Shop and Items for Donators Only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the equipment needed for PKing are usable by all players in some way, with the exception of a few items that you need a certain donation rank to equip. There are also items in the donator shop that are usable by all players, but only at the expense of the donators.
