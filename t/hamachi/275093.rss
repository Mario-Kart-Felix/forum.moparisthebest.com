<p>This is fairly rare problem that would typically occur for one of three reasons.<br>
A corruption of Identity information caused either by another piece of software on the machine or poking around the registry/config without care.<br>
Installing and running 1.0 version, then downgrading to 0.9, and then upgrading back to 1.0. If you did in fact go through this sequence, please download and run this automated fixup utility <a href="http://files.hamachi.cc/hamachi-fixup.exe" rel="nofollow noopener">http://files.hamachi.cc/hamachi-fixup.exe</a> (~ 90KB)<br>
Resolution</p>
<p>To work around corrupt profile<br>
Shut down Hamachi completely<br>
Go to Start &gt; Run &gt; %APPDATA%<br>
Rename the Hamachi folder to HamachiBackup<br>
Restart Hamachi<br>
You will get a new Hamachi IP by doing this, however the existing was already corrupted by something on your machine.<br>
To fix downgrade/upgrade/downgrade issue<br>
Note, this is almost never the cause of this error. Unless you’ve actually run a Windows version of Hamachi older than 1.0, use the other two solutions first.<br>
Download and save in temporary directory <a href="http://files.hamachi.cc/priv/hamachi-purge.reg" rel="nofollow noopener">http://files.hamachi.cc/priv/hamachi-purge.reg</a> (Right-click, Save As)<br>
Run the file</p>
<p>Tell your friend to try that, if not tell me, I’ll be glad to help you fix it.[/quote]hmm ok… but my friend has already a hamachi ip…like 5.127 and such it just that it dosent conenct but well try[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 23, 2009, 04:23:12 pm[/size][hr]cuban help!!! i got this error message</p>
