    <description>[b][u]Hello and welcome to my thread about HAMACHI[/u][/b]

[b]I have a simple question.  When I try to connect to my Hamachi, the status will change to &#39;connected&#39;.  Although it won&#39;t show all the servers I&#39;ve joined to etc.  Then about 10 minutes later it will start reconnecting.  I tried to reboot my computer, this only works 20% of the time.  I wan&#39;t to figure this out to prevent it from happening in the future.

What it says exactly is this : [u]Connection to the mediation server bibi.hamachi.cc has been unexpectedly lost.  Would you like to reconnect?[/u]

Even when you try to reconnect it won&#39;t, it will just stay &#39;reconnecting&#39; hours and hours on end.

To clarify, I want to know how to connect to my Hamachi, PROPERLY.
Thank-you.[/b]
