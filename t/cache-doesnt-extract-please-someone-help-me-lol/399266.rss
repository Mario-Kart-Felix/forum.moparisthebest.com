    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-doesnt-extract-please-someone-help-me-lol/399266</link>
    <description>I have made several webclients before and now this one will no extract the cache ive made sure ive set everything right but this is what the client shows

[url=http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/6537/fgsdfgsdfgsdfgsdfgsdfg.jpg]http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/6537/fgsdfgsdfgsdfgsdfgsdfg.jpg[/url]

in my cache folder there is only cache.zip and like all the &quot;main_file_cache&quot; files but they are all 0 kb so i know it didnt extract because  there shouldnt be a cache.zip in there at all and the main_file_cache should be relatively large.
Please help, any help is appreciated.

Thanks,
