    <title>Help... Learning to debug</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-learning-to-debug/2443</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to learn to debug some of these scrripts. I have a couple questions.

My qustion is Using Mopars version of aryan how do I get like the bank IDs. I hit F6 for debug and still didn&#39;t see the numbers I was expecting.

is there a better way to debug the script? 

Con some way point me to or explain on hoe the cordinates are setup on Aryan. I understand the whole x,y factor. Is the whole runescape area devided up? 

I have a scipt that doesn&#39;t walk correctly I&#39;m having a problem trying to know where it is trying to click to see what is wrong? How to I trouble shoot this?</description>
