    <title>Quests - Why are there no time put into those?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quests-why-are-there-no-time-put-into-those/526179</link>
    <description>Quests are fun for a lot of people. I feel like NO ONE does quests on their RSPS&#39;s though. Whether it be RS quests or custom quests, why doesn&#39;t anyone take time into those?

Most F2P quests are really easy to do it and they aren&#39;t hard at all! Just time consuming. Finding the youtube video to copy the dialogue can be difficult sometimes. But besides that, its not hard at all!

If you think I&#39;m right that it would greatly improve the RSPS community to add quests to our servers, what do you think it would take to get people to do so?

If you think I&#39;m wrong, just tell me why. I&#39;m curious to know why you don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be an improvement.</description>

Quests aren’t hard to make, but if you want to make a fun custom quest, you need to take the TIME to do it. It takes me hours to do so<br>

              <p>because the majority of people dislike quests. they only quested in RS to get the items they needed (barrows gloves for instance). however, it did outline a storyline for players and the overall concept of RS which some people liked. i highly doubt most servers these days have a concept and/or storyline, therefore, quests aren’t needed because their mainly revolved around bosses, minigames and pking - in which you can obtain the quest items from.</p>

One reason:</p>
<p>Lack of tools</p>
<p>There are no good development tools to create quests, and it’s just too time consuming and boring to try and write them by yourself.<br>

It has a quest editor in there and creates a quest file but I don’t think I should show whats inside[/quote]<br>

How would you implement giving Larry the money and killing the cat into that example, Vain?[/quote]easy. generally there are only x amount of actions that can be done in said server.</p>
<p>the api just needs to handle all stage actions such as ,   (item)</p>
<p>basically if a requirement is set as an item, in</p>
<p><code>  &lt;requirements&gt;
    &lt;skill id="strength" level="90"&gt;
    &lt;item id="995" amount="500000"&gt;
  &lt;/requirements&gt;</code>you would just need to make some sort of method call in the xml stage, such as <span class="bbcode-b"></span> or some sort.</p>
<p>then in the api itself, just create a check for tag  then pseudo: if (player.hasItem(PARSED.DATA.ITEM.ATTRIBUTE, PARSED.DATA.AMOUNT.ATTRIBUTE)) {<br>
deleteItem();<br>
}[/code]etc. etc.</p>
<p>all you have to do is think of all possible outcomes of a quest. (item gets deleted whilst talking to npc//do an emote perhaps//wield specific items//kill an npc//talk to an npc//click an item(such as spade)//click an object//pick up an item//etc)</p>
<p>once you obtain a list of all outcomes, just create method calls (tags/attributes) in the xml, and then parse the data and add checks for it server sided.</p>
<p>it will be just like writing a quest now, except when you’re checking something (if a player has item) you wont define the item, but rather a tag.</p>

              <blockquote>"Hans the Corrupt". This Quest is an example of how multiple approaches will be able to be utilized to solve the Quest. In this Quest, Sir Percival (Knight of the Square Table) requests an audience with the Player. The Player learns after having spoke with Sir Percival, that one of Cynosure's most beloved public figures - Hans - may be using Forbidden Magic (Administrators will have this Spell Book at their disposal eventually), to create Coins from Gold via Dark Alchemy. The Player may speak with Hans, but Hans will not reveal anything without a Disposition of 100. With a Disposition of 100, Hans will admit to it and the Quest will finish up quickly. Without it, however, the Player must either: 1. Pickpocket the information from Hans (20 Theiving Required), 2. Search Hans' Castle for the information, or 3. Defeat Hans in Combat (Hans will transform into a Monster via Forbidden Magic). In the end, however, the outcome will be the same. Hans and yourself are teleported to the Knights of the Square Table for a confrontation. After finding Hans guilty of the use of Forbidden Magic for personal gain, he is sentenced to be banished (inside an Instanced Dungeon). Hans makes many later appearances in-game as an enemy of the Knights of the Square Table.
<p>Pre-requisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combat Level of 20.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,000,000 Coins (the Coins Hans made from his Dark Alchemy)</li>
<li>Iron Armor Set (Item Quality Mundane)</li>
<li>Emerald Ring (Item Quality Common)</li>
<li>Black 2-Handed Sword (Item Quality Uncommon)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Square Party". This Quest is do-able from Combat Level 1, and has no pre-requisites to start or complete. This Quest also serves as an example of the N.P.C. V.S. N.P.C. Combat System. At the beginning of the game, once a Player has been in-game for a certain period of time, a N.P.C. walks up to the Player with an Invitation from the Knights of the Square Table. The Invitation reads that the Knights are throwing a party, and would like for the Player to attend. Upon visiting their Castle, a Cutscene begins, and shows a Vampire escaping from their Castle Dungeon. The Player procceeds into the Castle, where another Cutscene plays depicting how the Knights of the Square Table party (by standing at their Square Table with Drinks spawned in front of them onto the table and telling jokes via N.P.C. Text Updates). The Vampire bursts into the room, and the Knights attempt to Slay the Vampire, but cannot kill it without Garlic. The Player is to search the Castle for some Garlic (found in the Castle Kitchen). Once the Player finds the Garlic, they must use it on the Vampire when it is close enough to death (the Knights fight the Vampire).
<p>Rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>100,000 Coins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to access a Minigame where the Player can prepare meals for the Knights of the Square Table. Be careful not to burn the food though!</p>
</li>
</ul>

Google? Which word are you trying to say (censor evasion isn’t against the rules, btw, as long as you don’t break other rules whilst doing so)</p>
