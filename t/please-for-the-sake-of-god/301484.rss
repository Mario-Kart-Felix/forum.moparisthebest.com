    <title>Please... For the sake of god</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-for-the-sake-of-god/301484</link>
    <description>Please stop telling people they fail at java. IT DOESN&#39;T MATTER. It is a computer programming language that will be replace within a few months. Everyone starts out knowing nothing. The only difference between you and a &#39;noob&#39; or a &#39;retard&#39; is that you have more experience than them and also you had a greater desire for knowledge. That&#39;s just it. Half the people here have NO desire for knowledge. They couldn&#39;t be half-assed to learn java. All that matters for them is to get the server up. So next time you call someone a noob or something think of it this way. They could either have a lot of desire and become the next delta, or Whoever! or they could run there server for a week, think it&#39;s too hard and it is not worth the effort and quit. That&#39;s just about the only difference. 


Now let me tell you something. You can know all of the java syntax and suck at &#39;coding&#39; or &#39;programming&#39; or whatever you wish to call it. Why is that? To be good at Java and most other programming languages you must be able to imply your knowledge with desire and reasoning (logic).

Discuss your opinions.</description>

<p>It takes teacher’s to teach.</p>
<p>So either way people who are “good” and are not good still visit these forum’s.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to sit here flame, spam, or even say people are not good at Java, then check your first couple of post, because I’m sure everyone on this community was once like “How do i do this? WHY DOESN’T IT WORK!!!” - quote from a person who thought people could play hybrid scape on the MoparScape client with him.</p>
