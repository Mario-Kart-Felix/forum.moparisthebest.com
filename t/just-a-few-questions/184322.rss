    <title>Just a few questions</title>

    <description>     Hey everyone, my new server chatscape is now semi operational, there are only a few things holding it back. 


1. i&#39;ve created my own client based off of eyrescape, in the readme file it states that you have to have the .file store 32 file in another file named cache. This &quot;cache&quot; is making the client pretty big so that it might discourage people. I need to know if you can run it without the cache.

2. as i said before i made a client based off of eyrescape, what i need now is a webclient. I found a tutorial mabey two weeks ago, followed it to the letter, but the following app simply said &quot;applet notinited&quot; any help or ideas?

3. If you have some spare time check out the website i set up chatsscape.co.nr, im open to any suggestions!</description>
