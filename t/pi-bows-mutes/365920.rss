    <title>[pi] Bows &amp; Mutes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-bows-mutes/365920</link>
    <description>It appears I have hit a road bump.

I have both an IP mute and normal mute command that succesfully add players user name and IP to text files. What I need now is to know how but mostly wher to find and restict players talking to unmuted players only.

My second problem is that I wanted to add a new bow to my PI server but cannot find where to add the ID so that it requires and fires arrows.


Any help is appretiated. (just remeber, it&#39;s a PI server, not delta!!!!!)</description>

<p>Heh. Sounds (to me) like you didn’t want players talking to muted players.</p>
<p>And well, what you need to do is find packet 4 I think it is (The chat packet) check if the player is muted using an if statement, if so return.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(muted) {
    // Send a message or something here if you like.
    return;
}</code></pre>
<p>Obviously - You’ll need to change it to do exactly what you want and change if <span class="bbcode-i">muted</span> variable to yours.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ummm ok. But heres the thing, I don’t just have “isMuted” Infact there isn’t even a line for that in my char files. Instead, like I previously said twice now I think, I have all my muted players names and/or IP’s in a .txt file list.</p>
<p>Here is my chat packet.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">package server.model.players.packets;

import server.model.players.Client;
import server.model.players.PacketType;
import server.Connection;

/**
 * Chat
 **/
public class Chat implements PacketType {

	@Override
	public void processPacket(Client c, int packetType, int packetSize) {
		c.setChatTextEffects(c.getInStream().readUnsignedByteS());
		c.setChatTextColor(c.getInStream().readUnsignedByteS());
        c.setChatTextSize((byte)(c.packetSize - 2));
        c.inStream.readBytes_reverseA(c.getChatText(), c.getChatTextSize(), 0);
		if (!Connection.isMuted(c))
			c.setChatTextUpdateRequired(true);
	}	
}
</code></pre>
<p>How would I change… say this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (!Connection.isMuted(c))</code></pre>
<p>To read the names from the text file (or IP’s) and then stop them from talking if they are on the list?</p>
