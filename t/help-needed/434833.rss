    <title>Help needed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-needed/434833</link>
    <description>Ok, so i used to code a bit. After i quit a couple years back i got a new comp and has nothing on it. But what i need help with, is i downloaded the jdk (oracle has made everything a lot more difficult), but its not letting me read .class files, .gui or any other file needed to update to be able to change anything. I was gonna check out the gazaascape 562, but its having errors when i run. And i cant change anything. Please help, Thanks.</description>

<p>haha tried to forget most of it, thought it was a no lifer kinda thing and quit… ive never worked on anyhing over 459… EVER. but i really wanted to try this gazaascape out, and i truly do not understand that completely… I just wanna be able to double click files and have them open like i could a while back. I cant make any edits or even get the game to run because its not letting me view ANYthing. Java, .class, anything at all. and the files that need to be edited in the source are all .class files, what do i need to do?</p>

</aside>
<p>Sounds very…Leecher/noobish.</p>
<p>As i recall, Gazzascape is set to the ip 127.0.0.1, so nothing needs to be changed, all you need to do is change the java version in the .bat files to yours, and run the server before the client so you dont get the j5_connect error.</p>
<p>If you cant do this, you shouldn’t be programming.</p>

This reminds me of the time years ago when i thought i was badass, and opened pictures with notepad and edited them. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>OP: there is no such thing as the .gui extension, BUT in the Client side (depending on the base) there is sometimes a GUI.java file…Sounds to me like you never programmed ever.</p>
