    <description>hey everyone, initially posted in the wrong place, apologies. Anyhow I had a few questions. I am by far a newbie to mopar, but have managed to get so far. Downloaded just a test server, which works ok, but am unable to save data from the game on it or any other I have tried. Possibly in the script??Anyhow any help would be appreciated. Also wondering what would be the most complete server, in terrms of creatures, skills etc that people are using. Thanks

If you learn off a crappy source like Testscape, no offence to Nvi ible(Or however it’s spelled), you’re coding will be crap.</p>

<p>This guy is obviously new. He doesn’t know how to code as “1337” as you think you can. If he wanted to learn how to code private servers, the Java tutorials would do nothing for him. Private server coding is 10 times easier than real Java, if he went and read real Java tutorials he would get lost, which I’m guessing you would too.</p>
