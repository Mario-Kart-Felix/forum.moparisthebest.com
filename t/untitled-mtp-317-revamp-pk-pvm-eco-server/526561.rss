    <title>Untitled MTP 317 revamp pk+pvm+eco server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/untitled-mtp-317-revamp-pk-pvm-eco-server/526561</link>
    <description>Rune mtp 317 has been my favorite off all sources, I had a small part(even with my inexperience at the time) in adding additons to it. After a short time Marcbob decided to release it. Unfortunately a number of flaws existed with this source, especially later in development with the breaking of npc drops. Because of this its popularity depleted. The download links for rune mtp 317 are still around but not the originals. Fortunately I kept a backup copy of the source we were working on. It is here that I will display my developements in working with this source and the road I am traveling to make this server available for users to play on once more.

Ill add more when I think of them, if you have suggestions leave them below. Don&#39;t suggest Chaotics, pvp armor, customs.(Already have most of this,and don&#39;t want a bunch of customs). I want content filled suggestions :D, something players get on and are like &quot;ooo I never play servers with this!&quot;.

Just Read through some other servers in developement and I am quite impressed with the content the community produces. I have a lot of work ahead of me to catch up.</description>
