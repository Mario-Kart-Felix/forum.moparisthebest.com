    <description>Working on rsc archiving and I came across some old jars which I found the date they were active. Looking to fill in the gaps etc. Just sharing, thought it might be worth 2 minutes to look at.

mudclient14 - January 17th 2001

mudclient111 - December 14th 2001

mudclient120 - February 4th 2002
mudclient120 - February 12th 2002
mudclient120 - March 28th 2002

mudclient145- June 3rd 2002
mudclient145 - August 2nd 2002

mudclient155 - September 27th 2002
mudclient155 - October 4th 2002
mudclient155 - November 25th 2002

mudclient159 - November 30th 2002
mudclient159 - December 5th 2002

The reason I was doing this was to see if I could fully document the history of the client. What they did with each update etc. I lack the knowledge to do it how I want. (Fully refactoring each client) I think the only person here capable of it is super_. Anyways yea that was my plan. To give the changes from one client to the next.</description>
