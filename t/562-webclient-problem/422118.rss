    <title>562 WebClient Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-webclient-problem/422118</link>
    <description>Greetings MoparScapers!

Alright, I&#39;m having a major problem with my Webclient, it&#39;s hosted on a free hosting site, maybe that&#39;s the problem. When i click on WebClient.php, it loads java correctly, then it starts downloading my Cache that i have uploaded. The Cache is perfectly fine, same with the jar file. I tested on my main computer, it downloaded the Cache perfectly fine, I tested on my other computer, It runs windows 7, It downloads the Cache perfectly fine. But when i try and download it on my other other computer, It runs XP Professional windows, It downloads the Cache up-to 8% then it completely crashes. So i tested it on my friends computer, It wont even Download the Cache. I&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;m not doing anything wrong, It could be the Free hosting site. The Cache is uploaded to mediafire. I got a direct link to the Cache.

Please try it out, You wont be able to Login to the server, Because i haven&#39;t released it yet.

Edited: I found out only people who run XP windows have this problem. Windows 7 and vista works fine.</description>
