    <title>562 Webclient problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-webclient-problem/398333</link>
    <description>Hello all,

I did all the steps in making a webclient and I uploaded the JAR signer that I created. The problem is that when I put it on the website, nothing loaded.. and instead it showed two links saying jos.jar and webclient.jar.

So yeah.. any help would be appreciated.

Thanks.

EDIT: I got another problem now, i put the code onto the page and it says &quot;error- click for details&quot; and the screen goes white. Anybody know what I could do to fix this?</description>

<p>I followed Laurent 248’s guide. And thanks for that, i kinda uploaded the wrong thing. But, now im having another problem lol. My webclient goes white and says this message:</p>
<p>"The requested URL /error_game_invalidhost.ws was not found on this server.</p>
<p>Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request." How can I fix this? thanks</p>
