    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/initial-stack-is-null/252364</link>
    <description>Whenever trying to decompile/deobfuscate the classes in the loader.jar file from the runescape website, I always seem to have a AssertError thrown at me.

Class5 and the Applet_Sub1 class both seem to have this error, so they don&#39;t get decompiled.  I know that I&#39;m not going to be spoon fed any answers, or any type of way to completely fix this, but somebody tell me at least what is causing this error, because I can try to fix it after that...

How did this have to do with RS2 client hacking?

I was told that, in order to load a modified client, I was going to have to somehow make the loader load my files.  So I was thinking that I would decompile it then take it from there.

Thanks, if you post, for trying to help.

Before you people tell me what to do, I already looked into jode, and took a look at the classes that were defined in these errors.</description>

<p>the only way to run it is when the hd client fails,<br>
it will redirect you to <a href="http://www.runescape.com/slu.ws" rel="nofollow noopener">www.runescape.com/slu.ws</a> and will launch an unsigned applet</p>
<p>[quote=“Jagex”]You are seeing this page because we could not start RuneScape on your computer in ‘signed’ mode. This means that you did not (or were not able to) grant permission to RuneScape to run as it normally does. To avoid seeing this page again, please ensure that you accept the pop-up security warning that appears a few seconds after loading the game. If this pop-up does not appear, try rebooting your machine and make sure you click ‘Yes’ when asked if you want to trust the RuneScape applet.</p>
<p>Loading and running the game ‘unsigned’ like this takes much longer, as it must re-download all the content every time you play; you will also be unable to use RuneScape’s high detail graphics mode or use the in-game world switcher without reloading the game.</p>
<p>To work around this, you may use this page to manually select a world and then load the game. Please be aware that loading the game from this page will always load the unsigned game, so you should only use this page if you really have no other option.[/quote]</p>

<p>Blocking permissions is an issue. Other than accessing the Calender when the Policy is checked not much happens. I thought it would be sufficient until they concentrated on detecting the bot and even if they did successive layers of camouflage could be used in a similar manner to File.</p>

<p>What are you talking about…? Decompiling is still perfectly possible, just recompilation afterward is highly unlikely. In fact, the loader obfuscation isn’t that bad, except in loader.class itself (especially the run() method).</p>

<p>You should edit the loader via bytecode.</p>

              <p>Whenever trying to decompile/deobfuscate the classes in the loader.jar file from the runescape website, I always seem to have a AssertError thrown at me.</p>
<p>Class5 and the Applet_Sub1 class both seem to have this error, so they don’t get decompiled.  I know that I’m not going to be spoon fed any answers, or any type of way to completely fix this, but somebody tell me at least what is causing this error, because I can try to fix it after that…</p>
<p>How did this have to do with RS2 client hacking?</p>
<p>I was told that, in order to load a modified client, I was going to have to somehow make the loader load my files.  So I was thinking that I would decompile it then take it from there.</p>
<p>Thanks, if you post, for trying to help.</p>
<p>Before you people tell me what to do, I already looked into jode, and took a look at the classes that were defined in these errors.</p>
