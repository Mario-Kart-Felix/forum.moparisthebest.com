    <title>Unable to play server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unable-to-play-server/337685</link>
    <description>im trying to play my friends server and i run the client and i log in and everything but after i take a few steps i log out and get some java error. i have java 20 and JDK 20 and both are in my environment variables im running windows 7 64-bit but my java is saved at program files not program files (x86) so my variables are set to normal program files which is the correct thing, but yet my client shuts off, any help will be appreciated thank you!

P.S. i posted this in client help section to but got no help so maybe someone here can help</description>
