    <description>Well this is a simple Gopher server.. made by me.. It serves Gopher pages..

For those that dont know what Gopher is: [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher (protocol)]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher (protocol)[/url]

To test it yourself: start server, and type gopher://127.0.0.1 into your browser (Mozilla required!)

1. Disclaimer

The maker of this server doesnt take any responsibility about this code

NOTICE: Please, do only send emails to my address, if its really required...

-------------------------------------------

2. Version history

v1.0 = This version, first public one
v0.1-0.9 = Private versions. Not given out to anyone

-------------------------------------------

2.1 Info:

This project started as a hobby project.. It became so good, that i throught it was good for releasing :)

NukeGopher&#39;s target is to create a portable, and fast Gopher information server

Currently its pretty simple, but is very fast.

-------------------------------------------

3. Syntax of data files

All Gopher page files should be in data folder. They should end with &quot;txt&quot; extension

3.1 Starting pages

To start pages, you must type #START_FILE SITE_NAME. SITE_NAME is selector, which is wanted

&quot;root&quot; is selector for index page

-------------------------------------------

3.2 Adding links &amp; text

Text is easy to add, just write it into file.

#RAW_TEXT: Start raw mode (print text in file straight out.)

All link commands format is same, except #LINK_REMOTE

Format is: link command (tab) shown text (tab) selector

Valid link commands are:

#LINK_DIR: Link to directory text
#LINK_RTEXT: Link to raw text file
#LINK_BINARY: Link to binary file
#LINK_SEARCH: Link to search (no features using it yet)
#LINK_HTML: Link to HTML file

#LINK_REMOTE: #LINK_REMOTE (tab) shown text (tab) selector (tab) server (must be in port 70)


-------------------------------------------

3.3 Adding file links

Easiest way to point into files is to point links into Server:fileList/#path to file#


Or you can just easily define selectors for them
#DATA_FILE (tab) selector (tab) file path

-------------------------------------------

3.4 Defining custom descriptions for Server:fileList folders

Add this in config.cfg: SMsg-folders_name:Message
where folders_name is name of folder. If folder path was ff/ff then it would start with: SMsg-ff/ff

Also, add SDMessage messages for messages in all folders.
