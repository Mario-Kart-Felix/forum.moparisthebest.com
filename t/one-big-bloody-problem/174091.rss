    <description>Greetings people of MoparScape. I have come scross a few problems in my journey of knowledge...

One day I opened up my servers Client.java and decided to tidy everything up, I did about 10,000 lines in a few hours to start with. Compiled it and ran it...

I&#39;ve never had problems with it before, It was a 317 Deob from back in the day, All I did in my Tidy Up Routine was take out all the nasty spaces and line up everything correct to convention (The braces and indents)

There is a message that appears on my RunServer screen when I click Log Out, It crashes the server and doesn&#39;t allow me back in.

That’s actually pretty funny.</p>
<p>You could of used ThatOneServer’s “tiding” up program to clean up the code.</p>
<p>You probably commented out the interfaces that it’s suppose to show.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Even if you comment out the interfaces and dont put -1 it will show the interface i figured this out myself ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>Nope my interfaces are commented out and it doesn’t show, server side, not client side.</p>

              <p>I like to do everything manually, I wrote the vast majority of the script myself from scratch with a few other people’s open source servers to use as a guideline. I eventually backtraced and found the lines I had removed…</p>
<p>It was a part of the initialisation function<br>
I carried on reading through until I realised I saw interface 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 &amp; 0<br>
Something in my head clicked and wondered why if 0 was there, why not 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5<br>
I looked in CheezScape 80 Source for the initialisation function and found those 5 lines that had magically disappeared on mine…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">  setSidebarInterface(1, 3917);
  setSidebarInterface(2, 638);
  setSidebarInterface(3, 3213);
  setSidebarInterface(4, 1644);
  setSidebarInterface(5, 5608);</code></pre>
<p>Anyway… Thanks to all for your help and time, even though no one solved the previous problem, But the fact I solved it myself added to my knowledge so I can use it to help people in future.</p>
<p>To Jamie1200: I don’t want to have a more up to date client than 317 because I haven’t even got this one right yet. When I have completed this part of my quest in knowledge and got a perfect 317 Server and Client working how they should I’ll move on to something bigger. One step at a time.</p>
<p>To Java Is My Bitch™: I’d rather tidy things up myself manually as while I’m going through the code I’m learning at the same time, where everything goes and a brief understanding of it. I’m no Java Expert but I Programmed in C# and C++ which uses similar syntax to Java so I can almost understand the code. Since this is RuneScript and not core Java I need to get used to reading it in the same manner. I can’t do that if a program has done it for me.<br>
The other reason is, of course, the fact of this forums is here to help people. I’d rather ask for help and be shown what I’ve done wrong because I learn faster from other people than I do from reading a load of crappy tutorials which most lack detail.</p>
<p>To itzkyle: Depends what interface you comment out. As I’ve found out through trial and error, the Initialisation script sorts out the main sidebars and the interfaces. There are other “setSidebarInterface” functions in other parts of the Client.java too which control other things.</p>
<p>Despite solving that problem there’s still the other issue of which I updated my original post with a new picture for you experts to run your eyes over.</p>
<p>Once again, thanks to all…</p>
<p>Regards:</p>
