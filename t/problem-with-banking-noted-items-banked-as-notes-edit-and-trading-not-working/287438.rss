    <title>Problem with banking, Noted items banked as notes. EDIT: and trading not working</title>

    <description>First off ill say im using Allstar v2 source.

Me and a friend have been editing it for awhile, when we first got the source banking  was working fine. if you had a noted item and banked it, it would bank as the item, you could then withdraw it as the normal item, exactly the same as real runescape.

I&#39;ve lately realized this doesn&#39;t happen anymore, if you bank a noted item, it banks as a note, and cannot be withdrawn as the item.

Can someone please tell me whats gone wrong? neither of us have touched anything to do with banking, closest thing we&#39;ve done to do with banking is spawning new banks :S.

Keep in mind im pretty new to the whole server coding thing.

If you need me to post something, such as part of a code, just tell me what to search and ill happily post it :).

EDIT: Also just realized trading isnt working. when you get to the second trade screen and click accept, nothing happens.

this never happened when we first got the source.

Thanks in advance.

<p>I’ve edited a few item bonuses. added and removed items from shops, changed monster drops. edited how much a bit of food heals.</p>
<p>Can you be more specific?</p>

              <p>Well, if the banking was first working when you downloaded the source, one of you must have changed a line of code in the banking methods etc. Try looking through those.</p>
