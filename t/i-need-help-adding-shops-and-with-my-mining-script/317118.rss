    <description>Hey guys,

I am using this as my source:
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,292521.0.html

and when i add new items to the varrock general store and I compile and restart server none of the new items are there, even when I add a brand new shop non of the items show up it just becomes a empty shop.

Also I added ores in draynor because that is going to be my skilling area, and when you get the pick and click on any of the ores nothing happens, including clay or copper or tin :( I went to client.java and search the case and all the rocks have this similar code with the numbers a bit changed:

[code]				mining[0] = 4;
				mining[1] = 20;
				mining[2] = 40;
				mining[4] = 442;
				break;[/code]


I added this code to the copper:

[code]				mining[0] = 1;
				mining[1] = 1;
				if (misc.random(2) == 1) {
					mining[2] = 17;
				} else {
					mining[2] = 18;
				}
				mining[4] = 436;
				break;[/code]

and even if I click/right click to mine nothing happens! Please help with those two errors also server is supplied so you can download it and see errors for your selves thanks!</description>
