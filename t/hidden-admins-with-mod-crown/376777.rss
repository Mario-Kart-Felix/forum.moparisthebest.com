    <title>Hidden admins with mod crown</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hidden-admins-with-mod-crown/376777</link>
    <description>Title says it all. I&#39;m using ZeroScape source and client. Any help would be appreciated and I&#39;m sorry if this is client sided too but I posted it there as well because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was both and this seems to get answered more than client help.

Anyone?</description>
