    <title>Using both my speaker jacks together</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/using-both-my-speaker-jacks-together/547097</link>
    <description>My computer has two jacks for speakers, one at the back and a headphone jack in the front. I want to be able to use both for VirtualDj. I can&#39;t seem to get it working nor can I use both from testing it in Windows Audio settings. They both work but only one at a time (if I had something plugged in the back and the front, only the front headphone jack will work). 

What can I do to get both working without having to buy another sound card or spending any money?</description>

<p>Out of everything on the first page, half of those aren’t even related. The other half are for Realtek cards, which is great if OP has one. Assuming your card supports it, you’ll also need the Realtek drivers, and you need to use their audio manager.<br>

<p>Most Realtek cards have two settings:<br>
Make front and rear output devices playback two different audio streams simultaneously<br>
Make front and rear output devices playback the same audio stream (default)</p>
<p>They also have front panel jack detection turned on by default, which will disable the back one when it detects something plugged in up front. Again these settings can only be changed with the Realtek drivers, and using their audio manager. If you use the default windows drivers you won’t have access to these settings even with a card that supports it</p>

Okay in sound manager thingy only one sound driver is there. That is for both. There is no topic that states this, headphone jack (the front jacks) usually in most cases always overide the main (back in my case). I’ve tested this.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’m using realtek soundcard.</p>
