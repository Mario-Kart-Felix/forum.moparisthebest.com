    <description>Hello, moparscape.

I&#39;m going to be doing two tutorials for you today, both in PHP/MySQL. This stuff is fairly simple, but it can make your site smoother and look a little more professional.

First, we&#39;ll start with the switch statement when using pages.

What this will do is, when you go to some websites you&#39;ll see that a lot of their site revolves around index.php. This means your browser isn&#39;t actually loading another page as such, it&#39;s just loading a different section of code from the same file. This will look like &quot;http://www.yourdomain.com/index.php?page=something&quot;. Lets get to work!
[code=php]&lt;?
$switch = $_GET[&#39;page&#39;];
switch($switch){

case &#39;vote&#39;:
/**
This will display the index.php?page=vote page.
*/
break;

default:
/**
This will display your index.php page.
*/
break;

}
?&gt;
[/code]

I&#39;ll explain the code above, obviously &lt;? ?&gt; are the opening and closing tags of PHP. Your next line is then creating the variable of $switch and  starting off the $_GET method, you then have the extension of your page. I have this set as [&#39;page&#39;]; but it&#39;d work as something such as [&#39;mopar&#39;] it&#39;d just mean your link would be http://www.yourdomain.com/index.php?mopar=vote or whatever.

Your next line is then &quot;switch($switch){&quot; this is initiating the switch statement and then storing the values in the variable we created earlier, $switch.

You&#39;re now into the switch statement itself. &quot;case &#39;vote&#39;:&quot; is just telling your browser that this is the extension you&#39;re using. If you had it set to &quot;case &#39;mopar&#39;:&quot; it&#39;d be http://www.yourdomain.com/index.php?page=mopar. As a foot note on here, don&#39;t forget your &quot;break;&quot; otherwise your browser won&#39;t recognize the end of your statement. You can replicate as many of these as you need, therefore as many pages as you need. Understand? Good.

You then get on to the &quot;default:&quot; value. This is the code that shows on the page &quot;http://www.yourdomain.com/index.php&quot; or what will most likely be your homepage.

[hr]

To our next part of the tutorial!
This here is only for users who have a login/register system loading through MySQL.

This more or less just displays how many accounts you have registered on your system, I do it on my RSPS site, it&#39;s pretty simple to do, anyone with a bare knowledge of MySQL can do it. But here we go anyways;

[code=php]
&lt;?
$username = &quot;youruser&quot;;
$password = &quot;yourpass&quot;;
$database = &quot;yourdatabase&quot;;
$host = &quot;localhost&quot;; //99% of the time it&#39;s localhost

$handle = mysql_connect($host, $username, $password);

$found = mysql_select_db($database, $handle);

if ($found) {

            $SQL = &quot;SELECT `ID` FROM `characters` ORDER BY `ID` DESC LIMIT 1&quot;;
            $result = mysql_query($SQL);
            $field = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);

            echo &quot;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;center&gt;There are currently &lt;b&gt;&quot; . $field[&#39;ID&#39;] . &quot;&lt;/b&gt; accounts created!&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&quot;;

mysql_close($handle);
}
else {
echo &quot;Database wasn&#39;t found, check your variables.&quot;;
}
?&gt;
[/code]

So once again, &lt;? ?&gt; are your opening and closing tags, you&#39;re then declaring your database connection details and which database you&#39;ll be using. You&#39;re then creating the variable $handle, which is the connection variable, this connects to your MySQL. You&#39;ve then got your $found variable, this is more or less the database and it&#39;s connecting to it. You then have an if statement that exists if your database was found and connected to. You then have another variable $SQL which is declaring your sql query, you then have your $result variable which is actually doing the work and executing the query. You then have another variable, $field which is retrieving the data that was just executed through the query. We&#39;re now onto echoing the data we&#39;ve retrieved. Your next line of code is destroying the connection. Now, remember the if statement from earlier? Here&#39;s the else part to it. This is only printing a line of code to tell you that your connection couldn&#39;t be created.

I hope these help you.

Best Regards,
Ruby.</description>

<p>Maybe 5 minutes for both scripts? I already had the database needed for the second script, so all I had to do was connect to it and echo out the highest user id, as it’s auto incrementing it’ll rise every time a new user registers.</p>
