[center]Swanscape-Ps has re-opened in its early beta stages!
This Rsps was designed to be run for abit of fun and if the beta does well and we progress we will become bigger and offer alot more services and content!

So for a start off your going to be thinking the same that everyone does &quot;OMG THIS IS THE SAME LEECHED SERVER&quot; , correct this is a source found from an internet location! I am running this for friends at the moment as this was an idea we had. All are welcome , however if you do decide to come online and give me hate because its a &quot;leeched server&quot; thats fine ill ignore it, i wont let it put me down like it does alot of people.

The team here at Swanscape want players to have fun , but also be dedicated and willing to help support the server as it either slowly grows , makes no progress or gains a nice amount of players , but im not expecting everything big , i dont want that big server everyone dreams of. I am a relaxed 18 year old that smokes the occasion pot. I just want somewhere for my friends and future players to relax and enjoy themselves.  While we love to update and add content , we will be making slow progress, we are still looking for a few experienced developers and staff to join our team in the future to have a great time. The staffing in game will be laid back , everything is laid back , we want players to make jokes and make people smile. We dont want omg i lost my fight give my items back. Is all that says to me is &quot;i care about everything i have and myself and nobody else&quot;

Seriously guys! Swanscape is designed for a relaxed style of gameplay , we know there are bugs and things that will need fixing in the near future , we will fix these , but this will only be if a full version of Swanscape is made Officially live.

Here is a little teaser image below:
