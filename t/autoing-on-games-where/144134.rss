What do you think? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> There are two reasons to cheat in a game: levels (mind you, you better hope your account doesn’t get caught before you reach desired levels), or in-game currency, which can then be sold for actual money.</p>
<p>Most people would probably do the latter, at least in the case of RS, seeing as it’s extremely hard to avoid being caught and banned.<br>
However there’s a lot of chinese people that farm gold and sell it, so thats nowhere near as valuable as it used to be.</p>
