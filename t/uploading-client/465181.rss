              <p>I’ve created my executable jar file, I’ve put it in the file with my cache, and created a run.bat for my executable jar file. I took all of these things and zipped them and uploaded them, when i download them on another computer, extract them, and run the run.bat, the java screen appears, but it’s blank. I checked to make sure my auto cache downloader was coded correctly and it is. It should be working, and it’s not. I have a problem, I’m trying to get help solving it, you don’t have to be a condescending ass. Either help me, if you know how to troubleshoot my issue, or please don’t post on my thread.</p>

<p>Any basic computer user can find those hidden files. All you’d need to do is enable the “Show hidden files” option on the explorer. And it’s really only hidden on windows, because Mac and Linux users have a different filesystem, and can see all of the files with the same change.</p>
