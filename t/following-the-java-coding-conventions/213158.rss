    <title>Following the Java Coding Conventions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/following-the-java-coding-conventions/213158</link>
    <description>Okay guys, it&#39;s not hard. It is a rule, and the majority of you do not follow it. So, until this dilemma gets better, harsher punishments will be used, because hardly any have gotten the point.

If you&#39;re unsure of the Java Coding Conventions, please have a look through them here: http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/

We don&#39;t ask for much, but this an issue which has needed to be addressed so I took it on my behalf to do so: reading about them takes a max time on 30 minutes. It makes your code 1000 times neater and nicer to look at.

If you are having an issue or problem with them, please do not hesitate to ask someone, such as myself.</description>
