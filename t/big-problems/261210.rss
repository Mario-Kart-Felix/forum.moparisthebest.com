    <description>Well, I&#39;m using the Richscape source and sometimes when people log in after logging off or from a disconnect jad randomly attacks them with his range attack? Like all of a sudden Jad&#39;s range attack falls from the sky and k0&#39;s them. How can I fix this? Also, if anybody knows how to fix the x-log dupe I also need help on that, I heard that was an easy fix though.</description>
