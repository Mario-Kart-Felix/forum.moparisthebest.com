    <title>508 Server Running</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-server-running/246792</link>
    <description>Ok well I have a 508 Cache, client, and a source.  and I placed the 508cache in my C Drive. And I found my jdk, jre, etc. So i changed all of them in the run and builds in the client/server. When I run them I get errors on both. It says for the server that it is missing net/com/espeon/Server. Then the client says it is missing the Applet_Sub1. Could I take the Applet_Su1 from another client and just add it in somewhere. I really need help.</description>
