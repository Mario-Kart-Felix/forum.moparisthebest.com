    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hax-scape-please-look/272966</link>
    <description>Hax Scape:
Before anything, I would like to mention that I am just starting, and my main priority is gathering a few coders to help me out, so if you would like to help code, please PM me or join the website, found in my siggy. 

Credits so far:
Killamess (For his so far sexy base)
primadude (For his super sexy client)

Features

  - correct projectile heights and timing
  - correct max hits
  - level requirements

-NPC MELEE (includes)
  - prefectly timed, NO process
  - fairly accurate max hit formula
  - Dharok effects, hits higher when hp is low (based from str bonus and str level, not just adding a random number....)
  - all specials work
  - replace the special handler with the smaller one which is like 2kb?
  - prefect dieing, uses emote, does not die instantly has a slight wait.

-PVP MAGE (includes)
  - player bonus determines if they will splash or hit
  - if you splash the damage does not show
  - ancient makes use there effects (ice barrage switchs gfx once frozen, blood barrage steals hp, smoke barrage poisons)
  - proper timing for ancients, ice burst hits nearly instantly, ice barrage hits a bit more delayed and ice blitz takes the longest to hit, works prefect for rushing
  - if the player is frozen it doesnt stack up the timer each time you try and refreeze, you must wait till there not frozen to be able to refreeze them.
  - all level requirements
  - rune deleting
  - no massing

-PVP RANGED (includes)
  - same as npcs
  - also player bonus&#39;s determine if you hit or miss

-PVP MELEE (includes)
  - same as npcs
  - also player bonus&#39;s determine if you hit or miss

-PRAYER ADDED (includes)
  - all protection types work, str prayer also adds more damage.
  - protection types makes the damage be cut in half from what it would of been.
  - no massing with draining, stays at a steady rate.
  - nothing else added, still working on it

-POTIONS (includes)
  - all potions works
  - need to make potions lower the stat back down to the original stat.

-LAG ISSUES (includes)
  - this server used very low resources, stays at about 0.5 - 1.8 cpu usage.
  - alot of things have been taken out from the process and used in a different way for timing.
  - stable, has not crashed on my yet, but i have noticed a logout bug but have no idea what causes it, note this only lasts 15 secs then logs them out.
  - client is only 300kb

- PVP, this server has a very nice pvp to it, this makes delta look like rsc, seriously.

-PVP following
  - follows player, if frozen you cannot follow anyone
  - follows with ranging and also magic and melee
  - if following a player then gets frozen, you cannot move.

SKILLS
added basic firemaking and thieving

START TOWN
starts in lumbridge
all teleports require all the correct runes and levels

Ancients has only been found to work on Galkons, but I have fixed it, therefore being able to be used on Silab.

Filling locations with NPC&#39;s
[b] MORE [/b]
