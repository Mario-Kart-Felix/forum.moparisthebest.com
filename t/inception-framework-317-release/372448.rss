    <title>Inception Framework #317 - Release</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/inception-framework-317-release/372448</link>
    <description>[u][b]Why the early release...[/b][/u]
I was hoping to keep this a lot longer, but this kid stole it via team viewer... I figure it&#39;s only a matter of time before this is released somewhere else (if not, oh well) but this is basically before I added most of the stuff on my development page. 

[b][u]Features[/u][/b]
[code]Introduction (Trolls: this is for you)
Before you rant on, saying this isn&#39;t my work or I didn&#39;t make this - mostly the reason for people saying this, is because of &quot;Reputation Points&quot; - think please. Like I said, the only reason people honestly post stuff like that, is because of someones reputation points. Either that, or how long they have been on the forums. Just because someone is knew on these forums, doesn&#39;t mean they are new to private servers. So, please think before you post. Constructive criticism only please, and thank-you.

Credits
- John (Me) - Head coder in all categories; Python, Java, HTML (KompoZer).
- Anthony (In real life friend) - Same as listed above, tested a lot more things, and wrote a somewhat shitty combat system.
- David (Brother) - Wrote all skills. NOTE: these were written fast, and kind of shitty so if your a code whore don&#39;t expect good code.
- Eric (In real life friend) - Wrote my Magic and Range combat systems.
My friends don&#39;t go on these forums, but this project speaks for all of us. If I could, I can talk them into making an account on these forums possibly, just so I could insert a username rather than their names.

Inception - Server Core

    * Apache Mina Networking.
    * Re-wrote almost the entire server core.
    * Custom event manager (based off of Grahams), re-written for more Accurate timers, and runs off a list.
    * I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Extremely&quot; stable, but it is very close. Not as good as &quot;Hyperion&quot;, can hold problay 500 without lag.
    * Packaged for cleanness.


Inception -Server Content

    * Player Rendering
    * Login
    * Multiplayer
    * Walking and Running
    * Private chat, &quot;Split Chat&quot; and &quot;Red Chat in MSG Box&quot;
    * Player trading
    * Most skills loaded, very shitty codes.
    * Decent combat system, I&#39;d give it a 6/10.


Inception - Player Updating

    * Advanced Region updating system, MY FAV &lt;3
    * Many features, similar to that of winterLove. Including; Walking, Running, Trading.
    * A list runs for all connecting players. Rather than an Array. (got the idea from &quot;glestrts&quot;)


Inception - Stability
Granted, this server is not as stable as Hyperion, but I gave it a try. I held 500 players with no lag, around 600 somewhat of a lag. The server is somewhat clean, Client.java is 460kb. Most of the stuff is loaded through Player.java.

Inception - Client Work (#317 Deob)

    * Not original, but #317 maps. No Godwars, or anything like that, so PLEASE don&#39;t ask.
    * No custom items, #317 items only. No Godswords, or anything like that, so PLEASE don&#39;t ask.
    * No custom Animations, or GFX&#39;s.[/code]

[b][u]Other Release Information...[/u][/b]
Basically, this is mostly blank for the most part. Like I said, the main part of the release is because one of my so-called-friends, decided to take the source files from my computer (which was the only place we worked on; more GB, and RAM to work on) and somehow got them onto his, via team viewer. So, this is basically the OLDEST back-up I had, the stupid thing is I was in the process of backing-up my files when the jackass decided to take them. I learned my lesson, and my next project will be done by my self. Anyways, this is mostly blank maybe I will release some tutorials on adding skills, and some other big and important things that made this server unique.

More information can be found here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,467879.0.html (most of it quoted above..)

Things [b]NOT[/b] in the server:

[ul][li]Skills.[/li]
[li]Further progression in all combat areas.[/li][/ul]


Those are the big things that I lost, and I was very upset because for the most part this was built off of my knowledge of coding winterLove soures.

[b][u]PROPER CREDITS, for THIS release.[/u][/b]
-Creator of winterLove (Skills, and other files) &lt;3

Define server for me, and than re-check what you’ve been saying this whole time. You’ve repeatably stated, that winterLove was the first server ever created, which is FALSE. The first server, put together, would be Origrs2. Just because a server can’t be played on, that does not mean it’s not a server. So, jmood and everyone else who has said that winterLove was the first server, refer to this.</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>I Vain I, just restated what I have been trying to point out this whole fucking time. If what you are saying - that winterLove was the first server - than, that must mean every newer server we have today, (Insanity, Delta…) is based off of winterLove in someway? Are you going to tell me, that that’s the truth? No, someone branched off and created a base from this, that WAS NOT winterLove. This was my version of branching off, with winterLove codes as a base.<br>
[/quote]Not every server is based off of winterLove. Some people have taken time to write their own framework, such as Lin, Graham, Blake, and others. (I’m even attempting my own, right now, just see my signature.)</p>
<p>A server is only something which requests connection, and commands from a client.<br>
The server then processes the command, and sends the desired output to the client.<br>
The client then shows it.</p>
<p>In technical terms, OrigRs2 is the first server, as it was a single-updated, single-player emulator.</p>
<p>Though, as you were originally using the word ‘server’ as context, of all the other ‘servers’ out there, winterLove would be the first.</p>
<p>You cannot say that I have restated all your posts, as you are contradicting yourself through context.[/quote]</p>
<p>Explain how I have contradicted anything I have stated? I haven’t changed the position I was defending once, jmood on the other hand realized everything he had posted before was complete shit, once you started commenting on this. In the end, we all came to an agreement and lived happily ever after.</p>

<p>If you want to get even more technical WinterLove wasn’t even suppose to be a server, it was more of a proof of concept. It is technically the first emulator also as it was the only released server at the time, they’re others that could have been made, but they were never released so they can’t really count.</p>

<p>WinterLove was the only released RS Emulator at the time, so this and all other servers PI, Czar, Delta, Pimp, SHARD, Rune-Fusion are all WinterLove based. If they use the original Stream and Cryption class from the original WinterLove it is considered WinterLove based. Also you did not branch off because almost every peace of code in that server looks like Cleaned V4 (WinterLove v.3).</p>
<p>EDIT: Since you seem to not see this at all, WinterLove is Origrs2 just have more added in.</p>

<p>Python_?<br>
My name being that is in relation to my High-School team. **** Pythons…? It has no correlation what so ever with programming “Python”. What makes you think I know nothing about it? You have no proof, nor reasons to assume that I do not how to program Python. Mk, so lets refer back to what jmood said, about winterLove being the first server? This was incorrect, and you basically just proved me right. winterLove was the first playable server, but not the first server. So thank-you for stating almost exactly what I  said; again.</p>

<p>How can I say that? Because that is the truth. Just because two servers look alike, doesn’t mean that they are automatically the same. Thats like saying Project Insanity and DeltaScape are exactly the same; sure, they look alike but they are not.<br>
Just because some code is ripped;</p>

Doesn't mean the whole server is dependent on those files.

              <p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Why the early release…</span></span><br>
I was hoping to keep this a lot longer, but this kid stole it via team viewer… I figure it’s only a matter of time before this is released somewhere else (if not, oh well) but this is basically before I added most of the stuff on my development page.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Features</span></span></p>
<p>[code]Introduction (Trolls: this is for you)<br>
Before you rant on, saying this isn’t my work or I didn’t make this - mostly the reason for people saying this, is because of “Reputation Points” - think please. Like I said, the only reason people honestly post stuff like that, is because of someones reputation points. Either that, or how long they have been on the forums. Just because someone is knew on these forums, doesn’t mean they are new to private servers. So, please think before you post. Constructive criticism only please, and thank-you.</p>
<p>Credits</p>
<ul>
<li>John (Me) - Head coder in all categories; Python, Java, HTML (KompoZer).</li>
<li>Anthony (In real life friend) - Same as listed above, tested a lot more things, and wrote a somewhat shitty combat system.</li>
<li>David (Brother) - Wrote all skills. NOTE: these were written fast, and kind of shitty so if your a code whore don’t expect good code.</li>
<li>Eric (In real life friend) - Wrote my Magic and Range combat systems.<br>
My friends don’t go on these forums, but this project speaks for all of us. If I could, I can talk them into making an account on these forums possibly, just so I could insert a username rather than their names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inception - Server Core</p>
<pre><code>* Apache Mina Networking.
* Re-wrote almost the entire server core.
* Custom event manager (based off of Grahams), re-written for more Accurate timers, and runs off a list.
* I wouldn't say "Extremely" stable, but it is very close. Not as good as "Hyperion", can hold problay 500 without lag.
* Packaged for cleanness.
</code></pre>
<p>Inception -Server Content</p>
<pre><code>* Player Rendering
* Login
* Multiplayer
* Walking and Running
* Private chat, "Split Chat" and "Red Chat in MSG Box"
* Player trading
* Most skills loaded, very shitty codes.
* Decent combat system, I'd give it a 6/10.
</code></pre>
<p>Inception - Player Updating</p>
<pre><code>* Advanced Region updating system, MY FAV &lt;3
* Many features, similar to that of winterLove. Including; Walking, Running, Trading.
* A list runs for all connecting players. Rather than an Array. (got the idea from "glestrts")
</code></pre>
<p>Inception - Stability<br>
Granted, this server is not as stable as Hyperion, but I gave it a try. I held 500 players with no lag, around 600 somewhat of a lag. The server is somewhat clean, Client.java is 460kb. Most of the stuff is loaded through Player.java.</p>
<p>Inception - Client Work (<span class="hashtag">#317</span> Deob)</p>
<pre><code>* Not original, but #317 maps. No Godwars, or anything like that, so PLEASE don't ask.
* No custom items, #317 items only. No Godswords, or anything like that, so PLEASE don't ask.
* No custom Animations, or GFX's.[/code]
</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Other Release Information…</span></span><br>
Basically, this is mostly blank for the most part. Like I said, the main part of the release is because one of my so-called-friends, decided to take the source files from my computer (which was the only place we worked on; more GB, and RAM to work on) and somehow got them onto his, via team viewer. So, this is basically the OLDEST back-up I had, the stupid thing is I was in the process of backing-up my files when the jackass decided to take them. I learned my lesson, and my next project will be done by my self. Anyways, this is mostly blank maybe I will release some tutorials on adding skills, and some other big and important things that made this server unique.</p>

<p>Things <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> in the server:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Skills.[/li]<br>
[li]Further progression in all combat areas.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Those are the big things that I lost, and I was very upset because for the most part this was built off of my knowledge of coding winterLove soures.</p>
