<p>If you want to get even more technical WinterLove wasn’t even suppose to be a server, it was more of a proof of concept. It is technically the first emulator also as it was the only released server at the time, they’re others that could have been made, but they were never released so they can’t really count.</p>

<p>WinterLove was the only released RS Emulator at the time, so this and all other servers PI, Czar, Delta, Pimp, SHARD, Rune-Fusion are all WinterLove based. If they use the original Stream and Cryption class from the original WinterLove it is considered WinterLove based. Also you did not branch off because almost every peace of code in that server looks like Cleaned V4 (WinterLove v.3).</p>
<p>EDIT: Since you seem to not see this at all, WinterLove is Origrs2 just have more added in.</p>

Define server for me, and than re-check what you’ve been saying this whole time. You’ve repeatably stated, that winterLove was the first server ever created, which is FALSE. The first server, put together, would be Origrs2. Just because a server can’t be played on, that does not mean it’s not a server. So, jmood and everyone else who has said that winterLove was the first server, refer to this.</p>

<p>I Vain I, just restated what I have been trying to point out this whole fucking time. If what you are saying - that winterLove was the first server - than, that must mean every newer server we have today, (Insanity, Delta…) is based off of winterLove in someway? Are you going to tell me, that that’s the truth? No, someone branched off and created a base from this, that WAS NOT winterLove. This was my version of branching off, with winterLove codes as a base.<br>
[/quote]Not every server is based off of winterLove. Some people have taken time to write their own framework, such as Lin, Graham, Blake, and others. (I’m even attempting my own, right now, just see my signature.)</p>
<p>A server is only something which requests connection, and commands from a client.<br>
The server then processes the command, and sends the desired output to the client.<br>
The client then shows it.</p>
<p>In technical terms, OrigRs2 is the first server, as it was a single-updated, single-player emulator.</p>
<p>Though, as you were originally using the word ‘server’ as context, of all the other ‘servers’ out there, winterLove would be the first.</p>
<p>You cannot say that I have restated all your posts, as you are contradicting yourself through context.[/quote]</p>
<p>Explain how I have contradicted anything I have stated? I haven’t changed the position I was defending once, jmood on the other hand realized everything he had posted before was complete shit, once you started commenting on this. In the end, we all came to an agreement and lived happily ever after.</p>
