    <description>tutorial on how to put a skateboard together.

The set up.(part 1 of this tutorial)
------------
Alright for your basic setup your going to want a skateboard deck(prefferable 7.5&quot; wide by 31.5&quot; long). skateboard trucks, the are what hold the wheels to the board, and are somewhat the things that allow you to ollie.
Then you will need You will also need griptape to go on top of the board(griptape allows the person on the skateboard to stay on it and do all your tricks) griptape can come in many colors so make your choice. griptape is also better if it is not dirty or wet but its up to you how good you care for your board.
You may also need bolts and nuts(they come with the trucks)well thats if you want the trucks and wheels to stay on.
Now for the wheels the skateboard wheels are made of poly urethane there are many brands of skateboard wheels but i think spitfire is the best but it all a matter of opinion.
Next you will need bearings for your wheels and most likely your are a beginner if you are reading this so get abec 5 bearings for your wheels what brand again is up to you.
Last but not least you will need the trucks the part that attaches you to the deck and allows you to get height when doing your tricks.

you will also need a pair of plyers and a screw driver.

The assembly (part 2 of this tutorial)
-------------
Ok what you do know if take your skateboard deck and lay it with the graphics down on your lap so the top with the woodgrain showing should be face up.
Take the griptape and peel the bottom stuff off the bottom of the griptape its like the stuff on the bottom of a sticker but watch out the bottom of the griptape is really sticky.
Take the griptape and place parrallel to the board and press down and make sure there are no airbubbles if there are take a knife and pop them. (only if you feel like it i do but its up to you).
Ok now use the flat side of a knife from the step before and rub it to make a white line cut it out on the line.
Now then find the holes froms the bottom and make holes on the top with your screw driver after that there should be eight wholes on the top of the board.
After you have made the wholes you take your bolts from before and put your screws down in the holes one at a time and put your truck on that screw.
After you have the screw on put on of the bolts on the screw and screw the bolt. Then put the screw driver in the screws hole then clamps the plyers
on the bolt and twist the the screw driver right till it is really tight(reapt this step till all the trucks and bolts are on).
Take out your bearings and you put two of them in each wheel so you should have 8 bearings and 4 pairs put the wheel on the arm of the truck as i call it
, and tighten the bolts that come with the trucks on till it is nice and tight.(repeat step till all four wheels are on).

GOOD JOB IF YOU UNDERSTOOD MY GUIDE AND GOT YOUR BOARD ASSEMBLED THEN I DID WHAT I WAS AIMING FOR.
