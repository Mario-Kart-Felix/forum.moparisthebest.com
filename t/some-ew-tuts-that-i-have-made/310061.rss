    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-ew-tuts-that-i-have-made/310061</link>
    <description>here they are i have learned almost everything about 317 now and im making some tuts

[code]Making a item command: When your making an item command, you want to start it like this: 
if (command.startsWith(&quot;xrichie&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) { Playerrights are just your rank. to figure out your rank, go into the files named &quot;how to make yourself a rank&quot;. 

To change the command, change the xrichie to whatever you want the command to be when you type it in. 

When you have figured that out and the rights, It&#39;s time to add the items.
so far, you have this:

if (command.startsWith(&quot;xrichie&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {
Next to add item do addItem(The id here,How many of the item);

Ok say i want max money and the command starts with xrichie. This is what i would put:
if (command.startsWith(&quot;xrichie&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {
                addItem(995, 2147000000);
                }
You always have to add the } at the end Or you will get 100 errors.[/code]



[code]Making a teleporter command: Making a teleporter command:

Ok, first you will see a command like this in client.java:
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;home&quot;)&amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0){                                  
teleportToX = 2905;
teleportToY = 9733;
sendMessage(&quot;You teleport to home.&quot;);
}

Where it says home means you type in this ::home to teleport how ever you make the command. Next, it says &amp;&amp; playerrights &gt;=0){ 0 Means its a normal player command. 

1 means a moderator command. 

2 means a administrator command. 

3 means a owner command. 

The rest after that is hiddens. 

The teleporttox Means the X coords. 

The teleporttoY Means the Y Coords. 

Do ::mypos to get the coords where you wnat your command to go, then type in the coords you want your place to go. 

The sendmessage is the message it sends you when you teleport you. 

Say i want to make shops and it looks like this: if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Shops&quot;)&amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0){                                 
teleportToX = 2905;
teleportToY = 9733;
sendMessage(&quot;You teleport to Shops&quot;);
}

You always have to do this :: for everycommand (afeter the ::, type in your command you made it).

Make your command anywhere but the bottom in client.java.

You always have to add the } at the end Or you will get 100 errors.

Lastly Hit compile and wait for it to compile. 

Save the file, Then close it. 

Next, double click on compile then wait for it to compile. 

When its done compiling, close the compiler and shut down the server, then instantly put it back up. When you log in, the command should work.[/code]




[code]Description: make an area that you dont lose items when you die
difficulty: 3/10
Classes modified : Client

this is straight forward.
Search
CODE
        // If killed apply dead


Then Delete everything under it make sure you stop before the &quot;//update correct hp in stat screen&quot;

then paste this.
CODE
        // If killed apply dead
        if ((absX &gt;= xxxx &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= xxxx &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= xxxx &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= xxxx &amp;&amp; IsDead == true &amp;&amp; NewHP &lt;= 1)) {
            NewHP = getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]);
            setSkillLevel(3, getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]),
            playerXP[playerHitpoints]);
            playerLevel[3] = getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]);
            refreshSkills();
        updateRequired = true;
        appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
            teleportToX = yyyy;
            teleportToY = yyyy;
            sendMessage(&quot;whatever death message you want..&quot;);
        }
        

        else if (IsDead == true &amp;&amp; NewHP &lt;= 1) {
            refreshSkills();
            ApplyDead();
        }


OK...
look at this for a moment
CODE
if ((absX &gt;= xxxx &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= xxxx &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= xxxx &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= xxxx

What this does, is determins the co-ords of where the fun zone is.
its done the way that wilderness levels are.
it kind of..draws a box.
heres what you do

CODE
if ((absX &gt;= southwest X &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= Northeast x  &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= Southwest Y &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= Northeast Y


Then after you have done that, look at

teleportToX = yyyy;
teleportToY = yyyy;

Change those to where you go when you die. [/code]</description>
