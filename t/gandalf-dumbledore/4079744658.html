I never read/watched/cared about harry potter but my wife likes it so I just finished watching all the movies yesterday.  I was already thinking about this, but Gandalf is much better.  Dumbledore died from a little spell and a tiny fall?  Gandalf fell to the center of the earth with a freaking balrog, then fought him to the top of the highest peak, killed him, then basically died himself and came back stronger.  Compared to that, it would be better to compare Dumbledore to Merry or Pippin.<br>
[/quote]I’ll quote Harry Potter 6:</p>
<p>[quote]Minister of Britain: But you can use magic! Surely you can sort this out easily…?<br>
Ex. Minister of Magic: The problem is Minister, the other side can use magic too.<br>
[/quote]Gandalf never had to really fight another wizard man to man from what I read/watched.<br>
But anyway… Dumbledore WANTED to die sooner (he was what, 150 anyway or something?), that’s the only reason he was actually killed by Snape with the Killing Curse. If he wanted to live longer, I’m sure he could have recovered from the potion that he had drunk… after the battle.</p>
<p>Offtopic but relevant: JK Rowling actually admitted in an interview that Dumbledore was gay (literally, as in homosexual) This has nothing to do with who is better (unless you’re biased), but it’s an interesting tidbit information that explains a few things for people that have read the books. (If you have, here’s the summary: Dumbledore was in love with Grindewald)[/quote]</p>

Ex. Minister of Magic: The problem is Minister, the other side can use magic too.<br>
[/quote]Gandalf never had to really fight another wizard man to man from what I read/watched.<br>
But anyway… Dumbledore WANTED to die sooner (he was what, 150 anyway or something?), that’s the only reason he was actually killed by Snape with the Killing Curse. If he wanted to live longer, I’m sure he could have recovered from the potion that he had drunk… after the battle.</p>
<p>Offtopic but relevant: JK Rowling actually admitted in an interview that Dumbledore was gay (literally, as in homosexual) This has nothing to do with who is better (unless you’re biased), but it’s an interesting tidbit information that explains a few things for people that have read the books. (If you have, here’s the summary: Dumbledore was in love with Grindewald)</p>

<p>Gandalf had to fight another wizard 0.0 he fought saruman !!!<br>
[/quote]Hardly. Sarumons tower was destroyed by walking trees, and the only time he actually faced him (besides the possessed king) he got his ass whuped and had to call upon a giant flying bird to save him.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But Dumbledore never actually went 1 on 1 with voldemort so… Plus Gandalf was a grey wizard at the time when saruman was a white wizard. When Gandalf became a white wizard he whooped everyone!</p>
<p>And the trees attacking was planned by Gandalf indirectly<br>
[/quote]Not true, Voldemort <span class="bbcode-b">feared</span> Dumbledore because of his power/knowledge. Dumbledore was the only person he ever feared. Before Harry, the Order of the Phoenix and the rest of my fellow wizarding kind had to depend on him to fight the great evil that once lay resting on these far distance lands.[/quote]</p>
<p>Dumbledore went 1v1 with Voldemort in the second to last movie. Also that is not the reason Voldemort feared Dumbledore.</p>

<p>If you really want to get technical, JR himself says that the Balrog was only rivaled by the dragons (I take this to assume the movies over-exaggerated balrogs size and power etc). However, in JK’s books, it’s easy for Dumbledore (and even some lesser wizards) to conquer such creatures. We can assume that JK’s magic (attacking from a distance, etc) that she gives to Dumbledore is just stronger than JR’s magic that he gives to Gandalf, in either form (short range etc).</p>

        <p>Obviously they aren’t immortal. They were basically ambassadors for the Gods into middle earth, not Gods themselves. If the Gods ‘rebirthed’ them into the world again, it wasn’t the Istari’s own doing. I’d also like to know where you read that Sauron was an Istari, I don’t really think that’s true.</p>
<p>They are of divine origin, but that doesn’t make them immortal either (being defeated by a nazgul is a good example)</p>

        <p>LOTR has been around a lot longer than HP (and has a much larger fan base of olders), I’m surprised HP even has that amount of votes on that site.</p>
<p>But yea, where did you read that Gandalf was a Maiar? I’m pretty sure he’s Istari…</p>

        <blockquote>Like I said, Dumbledore asked Snape to kill him.
<p>If you really want to get technical, JR himself says that the Balrog was only rivaled by the dragons (I take this to assume the movies over-exaggerated balrogs size and power etc). However, in JK’s books, it’s easy for Dumbledore (and even some lesser wizards) to conquer such creatures. We can assume that JK’s magic (attacking from a distance, etc) that she gives to Dumbledore is just stronger than JR’s magic that he gives to Gandalf, in either form (short range etc).</p>

<ol>
<li>snape killing dumbledore was pretty much planned. Dumbledore already knew Draco didn’t have the balls to do it.</li>
<li>The only reason “others” could fight dragons/basilisks/etc was because of pure coincidence and what would a story be if the main character died.</li>
