    <title>Pest Control Guide!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pest-control-guide/157808</link>
    <description>This is another one of my creations! I made this all by myself, and I did not leach it. Everything is by me and only me.

[hr]
[size=20pt][b]PEST CONTROL[/b][/size]
[hr]
[b]Getting There[/b]

First of all, to get to pest control, go to Port Sarim and then go to the 2nd to last dock and you&#39;ll
see &#39;Squire&#39; Talk to him and say &#39;I would like to go to your outpost&#39; and you&#39;ll be taken there. 
Then go to world 144, which is the most popular pest control world. Then head south and
you&#39;ll see different docks. The first one you&#39;ll see is for 40+, the one next to it is 70+ and the one next to that 
is 100+. All of these are different because the portals have different HP and the monsters are stronger.

[b]Playing Pest Control[/b]

Now time to play! Now, pick the appropriate dock for your level (40+,70+,100+) and click &#39;Climb Ladder&#39;.
Now you&#39;ll be on the ship! It takes 25 people or a couple of minutes for the boat to leave. And when you get there 
you&#39;ll see this:
[img]http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/1884/main1mh7.png[/img]

Now, the best place to go is the West, Purple portal, which is my best of choice.
So head West through the gates and go to the portal. Now you&#39;ll probably see this:

[img]http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/3306/main2un2.png[/img]

You&#39;ll see a portal (with a shield) and some strange creatures. Now, don&#39;t worry about any of these except
spinners. These you NEED to kill because they heal portals, making it very difficult to kill. Also, don&#39;t worry
about dying, this is a [url=http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=mini_games.htm]Low Risk[/url] game.

Eventually, the portal will drop it&#39;s shield, making it attackable. Now click &#39;Attack Portal&#39; and wait.
The portal will soon die unless there are some left over spinners. This is where you need to make a choice:

A)Kill spinners and let others kill portal
B)Keep on attacking portal and let other kill spinners.

Well, I recommend if your a low-level (40-79) to choose choice A.
If your a high-level (80+) choose choice B.

[b]Strategies:[/b]
If you are a low level, I suggest you don&#39;t attack the portals, and kill everything besides a splatter. Why?
Because splatters explode hitting in the low 20&#39;s. If you are a ranger or a mager, attack the portal. Why?
Because all portals have a very good weakness to magic and range. My recommendation for rangers is a
Dorgeshuun C&#39;Bow with as many bone bolts as you can afford. I state that because the Dorgeshuun C&#39;bow (AKA Bone
X bow) is very cheap and bolts are only 4gp ea. For magers I recommend ancients because of the high density of
creatures you will get well over 1k xp per cast. If you haven&#39;t done Desert Treasure, use the highest damage spell
you can cast.

[b]Armor/Weapon[/b] -Melee: I recommend at least rune with a decent weapon (Dragon Wep or whip) with your highest attack prayer on.
                               Magers: I recommend you have any set of full mystic and a good supply of runes.
                               Rangers: I recommend the Dorgeshuun C&#39;Bow (like I stated above) and armor that gives the best range bonus.
                               If you&#39;re using C&#39;Bow, wield a god book (Book of Balance, Unholy Book, Holy Book) and put on best range prayer.

[img]http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/6158/main3ox8.png[/img]

Now you&#39;ll (eventually) kill the portal. Once the portal is dead, go to other portals and attack
(and choose between choice A and choice B).

Game has ended? You should see this:

[img]http://img219.imageshack.us/img219/8436/main4ot8.png[/img]

You didn&#39;t see that? That means you didn&#39;t hit at least 50 damage during the game.


Well, once you save up your points, or if you&#39;re impatient and would like to spend
your 1 point right away, you can exchange them for items or xp. Items include farming
mining sets and Void Knight armory. Time to find the Void Knight, which looks like this:

[img]http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/3847/main5ll0.png[/img]

Now right click and click &#39;Exchange points&#39;

[img]http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/8657/main6ma1.png[/img]

Then you&#39;ll see the variety of XP exchange and items I was talking about:

[img]http://img219.imageshack.us/img219/3789/main7yf0.png[/img]

[img]http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/9148/main8mh6.png[/img]

Now, according to how much points you have, you can choose between XP,
By spending 1,10, or 100 points, or items.

To get your items simply click (for xp click amount of points to spend) it and press &#39;Confirm&#39;.
As shown below:
