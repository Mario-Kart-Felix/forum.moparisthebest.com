    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-on-some-shops-that-disconnect-me-s/14795</link>
    <description>well, my general store, zaffs staffs shop works, but horvicks and lowes shop dont work. i trade with either lowe or horvick and i reconnect..

i ask a friend and he said check for spaces in the shops, i went through every co-ordinate looking for spaces... no spaces what is it! then i decided on to delete horvick and lowes shop for good.. but i dont know how to delete

so can some 1 tell me on how to:

1, delete horvick and lowes shop, 
2, or sort out the problem on the reeconnecting trade</description>
