    <description>Okay i downloaded a client for my source the client was project insanity (exion) so is my source. Then i realized the client .java in the client was modeled different so i deleted the .java and class file and put it with the class and java file and compiled got no error. I ran it and go on then the spirit shield was invisble but still was clickable but when i click it, it equips as a helm and then i went to put it as a shield on item .java but nothing happens. I changed the client because when i ran the too i would dc if i did anything with the shield as in spawn or click it anything. Any help?

note i posted here is because this is dealed with server sided also i saw tuts on adding models in project insanity and you have to do stuff with source and then making the shield equip as a shield is source too.</description>
