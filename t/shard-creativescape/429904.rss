    <title>[Shard] Creativescape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shard-creativescape/429904</link>
    <description>[u]So i want to start a project (for fun), i will be using a shard base specifically Creativescape by R0cky Ownz ( i don&#39;t have alot of experience with servers but want to use this anyways ) but want some feedback of what you think of this base and any big problems with this.[/u]
[center][b] Also if you know any of the below please pm me or comment (don&#39;t tell me to look at Google as i did :) ).[/b][/center]
- How to make the server more stable and clean it up a bit.
- I have heard this server has random player disconnects dose anyone know how to fix this.
- How to get the character files to save in a readable .txt format instead of the .dat format i have looked all over for this (i changed it so it saves as a .txt but it has the unreadable characters i want all of them readable like in Delta or PI.)

Thx in advance and any help would be appreciated. :)</description>

<p>The character files would have to be redone to use file reader instead. which would mean you’d have to completely redo it. If you have no idea what your doing i wouldn’t start with shard.</p>
