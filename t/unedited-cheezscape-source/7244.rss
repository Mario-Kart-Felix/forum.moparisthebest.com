    <title>Unedited CheezScape source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unedited-cheezscape-source/7244</link>
    <description>Alright I&#39;m not sure if anyone noticed but the TestScape source is REALLY messed up.
There are plenty of bad codes, most of them not used others dont work all together. If I wasnt so lazy I would go in and fix them all but I really dont want to spend 4 years doing that. I&#39;m going to ask for the cheezscape source, your going to say:

A) Search it noob
B) It&#39;s at kulma.ath.cx
C) It&#39;s at rs-server.net
D) This topic will just get locked, without me finding help

Well if I search it, Im going to find posts exactly like this.
Site down

This site was meant to be for help, and I need it.

So now if anyone can ACTUALLY help me, please post</description>
