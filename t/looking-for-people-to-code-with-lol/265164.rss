    <description>Hey Guys, i have no frineds...

lol that ^ was a joke. but seriously, im starting a irc channel just for coding. all languages are welcome. java, batch, c++, html, etc. its more fun to talk with other people about your recent coding projects other then private servers. if ur good at hacking, batch virueses, keyloggers, ANYTHING,  come join the irc chat. Might Wanna Hurry Cuz i think this is gonna get locked.

Server - irc.getdarker.net or getdarker.net
channel - #code</description>
