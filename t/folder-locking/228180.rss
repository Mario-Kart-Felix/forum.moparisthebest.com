    <description>I&#39;m Thinking it&#39;s simple to do what I&#39;m looking for, but so far I have had no luck in finding this program.
Not sure if it exists, but is there a program that can lock your folders with a password.(More complex that what it sounds). Pics!

Uh so If I try to open the folder, a prompt box will come up asking me for the pass without the need of having the software installed, just those files to make sure your entering the right password. Anyone ever heard of such a program, I&#39;m tired of lurking =(.</description>

<p>I actually did google and found a program that described what I was looking for, but it didn’t work out. I had to encrypt the whole entire volume. I set the volume as my CD drive and put the files in there, it was successful, but then when I uploaded(Web server), it wouldn’t work. It would just open.</p>
