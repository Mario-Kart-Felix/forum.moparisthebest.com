    <title>Particles</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/particles/544343</link>
    <description>Hey, it&#39;s me once more. I&#39;m still looking for things regarding particle generation in 667+ clients. Since I can&#39;t post again in my last topic, I figured It&#39;d be better if I made a new one. Here goes:

What I&#39;m looking for is any information regarding the way particles are generated on models. I know how to add them, but I have no idea which type I&#39;m attaching to faces (will it be smoke? snow? fire? some colorful blobs?). I&#39;d like to know what it would be that defines the pattern. I have been informed that it&#39;s OpenGL, but that wasn&#39;t much help with finding where the client reads them from and how it displays them.

I&#39;ve tried following the path from how the client reads the model (which is where you assign the type value and what face it appears on), but with Jagex&#39;s seemingly random multiplication (like this: 

[code]	Class85(int i, int i_0_, int i_1_, int i_2_, byte i_3_) {
		((Class85) this).anInt778 = i * 2033948917;
		anInt773 = 1451019569 * i_0_;
		anInt774 = i_1_ * 1631001933;
		anInt775 = 383276227 * i_2_;
		aByte780 = i_3_;
	}[/code]
), it made it very confusing and extremely hard to follow. I hit a brick wall at that point, since I have no idea what those numbers mean (if anything but to obscure the goal). 

Anyway, any help is appreciated. Thanks for looking!</description>
