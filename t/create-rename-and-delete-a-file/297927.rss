              <p>by doing something like:</p>

<p>ps whenever using the ‘+’ operator on a string, the compiler interprets this as a call to stringbuffer.append(). oh and by the way, system.out.println does not only take string arguments.</p>

abraham2119, respect your greater. Ownagesbot has been around since you were probably just a little noob wondering how to run your server. Show him respect and maybe everyone might not hate you.

[/quote]rofl. greater as in longer? because as far as i know, even people who have been around the longest tend to be mistaken (ie you). if the “respect” you want me to give him is not to dare to prove him wrong, then stop trying.</p>
<p>no he didnt. he obviously believes everyone has a C: partition. use some fucking common sense, who would PURPOSELY limit their application to run on a single system (other than the creators of the system)???[/quote]I don’t know you.  I don’t know anything about you.  But you sound like a complete retard, please stop posting for the sake of my health.</p>

no one said he did it purposely… hes just saying its not the apis fault</p>
<p>anyway the initial statement that it was a flaw was sarcastic anyway referring to the other thread in this section, you guys are arguing about rubbish</p>
