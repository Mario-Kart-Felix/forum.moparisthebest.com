    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-error-connecting-for-other-people-pf/269327</link>
    <description>Okay guys, Heres my story, I&#39;ve hosted fine for past 6 months, usally every week I would go into the bedroom and turn off and on the switch, For my wireless G router thus reseting the last 3 digits of my IP.

This time I reset both my Comcast and my Wireless G router, By pressing and holding the reset button..The last 3 digits of my IP changed from .104 to .100 so I changed it in my portforwarding, thanking everything could work.. But now NOBODY can connect, Besides me to 127.0.0.1

I really need help, Highly appreciated.

Msn: Polemie@hotmail.com 
Or post here please!!

My Question:After I reset them both and portforwarded again, Why can I not host?</description>

<p>yes i once thought that it would be server related to but after arguing with moparscape staff i have come to the agreement that it is not a server related issue and is more of a internet/port issue</p>

              <p>Againt the rules, and dude please dont have a title saying “plz help me zomg need help” or something like that, it makes it hard on the people who are answering know what you are askin before they read the entire topic. And it will get noticed better if you actually post in the subject header your question. There is a sea of “need help” already <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
