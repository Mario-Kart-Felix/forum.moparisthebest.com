    <title>Get doom, blackjack, pong and more on your iPod!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/get-doom-blackjack-pong-and-more-on-your-ipod/87983</link>
    <description>This continues my string of iPod tutorials :)

There&#39;s a thing called RockBox, it&#39;s pretty cool, i have it on my 5g ipod video, i like it.

It&#39;s really simple to install, and has cool fonts, themes, games, etc. for you to download.

It doesn&#39;t play videos and it didn&#39;t even play my music, but you can boot into your regular iPod without rockbox too, so you don&#39;t always have to be in rockbox.

For the tutorial-

IPOD MINI 1G
1. Download this somewhere: http://build.rockbox.org/dist/build-ipodmini1g/rockbox.zip
IPOD MINI 2G
1. Download this somewhere: http://build.rockbox.org/dist/build-ipodmini2g/rockbox.zip
IPOD 3G
1. Download this somewhere: http://build.rockbox.org/dist/build-ipod3g/rockbox.zip
IPOD 4G GRAY
1. Download this somewhere: http://build.rockbox.org/dist/build-ipod4gray/rockbox.zip
IPOD VIDEO 5G
1. Download this somewhere: http://build.rockbox.org/dist/build-ipodvideo/rockbox.zip
IPOD NANO 1G
1. Download this somewhere: http://build.rockbox.org/dist/build-ipodnano/rockbox.zip
IPOD COLOR/PHOTO
1. Download this somewhere: http://build.rockbox.org/dist/build-ipodcolor/rockbox.zip

2. Plug your iPod in.
3. Extract it onto your iPod drive, for me it was G:
Note:
Make sure the folder is called /.rockbox/ on your iPod drive, i think you have to go into the extracted folder and copy the folder inside of it and then paste it in the same directory and delete the old folder. Cause for me the extracted folder wasn&#39;t called .rockbox
4. Download this and click run: http://download.rockbox.org/bootloader/ipod/ipodpatcher/win32/ipodpatcher.exe
5. Press enter when it asks you to install or not
6. When it&#39;s done, press enter again
7. Disconnect your iPod.

Now that&#39;s just the normal version, from there you can go to www.rockbox.org and extras to get themes, fonts, rockboy stuff (a gameboy emulator) and more.

Plugins are the games.

I know everyone wants doom cause you get to kill people on your iPod :P, so here&#39;s a tut on that too.

Doom:

1. Plug your iPod in
2. Go into your iPod drive
3. Go into .rockbox folder
4. Create a folder called &quot;doom&quot; without &quot;&quot;
5. For doom 1 dl: http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/pub/Main/PluginDoom/doom1wad.zip
6. Extract doom 1 and copy the wad file into the doom folder you created
7. For doom 2 dl: http://nahoo.net/downloads/go/again.shtml?games/doom/Doom-2.exe and click run
8. When the doom game pops up, hit escape.
9. Go into the directory where you unzipped it and copy doom2.wad
10. Paste doom2.wad in the doom folder in rockbox

Don&#39;t ask me how to get more versions of doom, that&#39;s all the versions I have.


Oh and, to boot into regular iPod

Restart your iPod and right away, flip the hold switch to on. count to 3 and turn it to off. should go to your regular iPod

For those of you that can&#39;t even restart your ipod, hold the menu+select keys at the same time until the screen goes black, if you can count to ten and it doesnt do it, try it again.</description>
