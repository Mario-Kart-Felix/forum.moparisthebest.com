    <title>Ice barrage help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ice-barrage-help-please/343007</link>
    <description>Hello.

I was wondering if somebody could help me making ice barrage hit more than one person at once, But only hit the 2nd or 3rd person depending on there combat level.

I already know how to make it attack more than one player and how to make it only usable in multi combat.

Help would be apreciated thank you.</description>
