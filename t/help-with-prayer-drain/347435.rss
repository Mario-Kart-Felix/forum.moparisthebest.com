    <title>Help with prayer drain</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-prayer-drain/347435</link>
    <description>I am using the Xelovution source and I noticed prayer drains really fast (goes from 99 to 0 in a few seconds). I searched client.java but couldn&#39;t find anywhere that I could change it at. If anybody knows what I need to change to make prayer drain slower please help me out.

Thanks in advanced.

Edit: Nevermind, perfect ring was making my prayer drain fast. Mod please lock topic.</description>
