    <title>Some problems with commands</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-problems-with-commands/522660</link>
    <description>Recently i&#39;ve started learning about java and tried to code an rsps. I tired to get as minimum help as possible from the net that way i could learn fast and without people spoon-feeding me. Had problems with this at first.


		if (cmd[0].equals(&quot;reloadshops&quot;) &amp;&amp; player.getUsername().equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Zalo&quot;)) {
    				ShopsHandler.loadUnpackedShops();
    				player.getPackets().sendGameMessage(&quot;Zalo reloaded the shops.&quot;);
    				return true;
   			}

Compiled and had a ShopsHandler symbol error which i solved it by randomly looking and codes and figuring where the probem lies which was i didnt import the file into the commands.java


Now a problem which i&#39;m kind of stuck with is this.

              <p>The error is informing you that the loadUnpackedShops void has a private modifier which means that it can only be accessed within the ShopsHandler class. Just go into the ShopsHandler class and give it public access.</p>
