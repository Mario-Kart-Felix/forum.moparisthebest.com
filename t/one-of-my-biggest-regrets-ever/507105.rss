    <title>One of my biggest regrets ever</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/one-of-my-biggest-regrets-ever/507105</link>
    <description>So i made a bid of 110$ on moparscape sponsored server list, however on the 7th or 8th i seen that you needed an application and i went to make sure i did all that. Then after i did it i couldnt see my bid anymore so i have no clue if i was in the top 10. I was also informed afterwards if i was able to bid i was already approved. So i must have done a application in the past. 

I really want to pay to be on this sponsored list i dont know whether to wait it out or just pay to the same place i sent the 5$ to be able to bid. I seen the rule that if i dont pay within the first day after bid ends i will be banned from ever being sponsored again so i am kind of confused on what to do. I hope i get some feedback from someone that can help me soon. I thank each and everyone who reads this, hopefully you can get some help pointed my way.</description>

              <p>You’re currently <span class="hashtag">#12</span> out of all the servers who bidded, I’ve approved your application but the bidding process ended 5 hours ago. So I’m afraid you won’t be able to get on the sponsored list this month, but you won’t be charged your bid either. The only way you’d be able to get on the list this month is if another server in the top 10 fails to pay up, in which case you’ll be bumped up. So 2 servers would need to fail the payment, which I don’t see happening if I’m honest.</p>
<p>Keep up to date with the process by reading all the appropriate sticky topics in the sponsored apps section, and try again next month.</p>
