    <title>Help deobbing RSPS client jarfiles</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-deobbing-rsps-client-jarfiles/521420</link>
    <description>So. I&#39;ve recently discovered reflection and would like to utilize it. Problem is, all the servers worth creating reflection libraries for have their client jarfiles obfuscated.

I require help in deobfuscating these.

I&#39;ll have you all know I&#39;m a beginner at Java. I would like to actually learn how to do this, but I&#39;d also like to actually get it done in a reasonable amount of time. A mix of results and learning would be great.

I&#39;ve attempted on my own but failed.

Basically, I want to turn this [img]http://puu.sh/3dAIn.png[/img] into this [img]http://puu.sh/3dAL8.png[/img]. I need to get the original client classfiles. I hear there&#39;s a lot of manual renaming, whatever that means?

If anyone could assist me in doing this, I&#39;d be very appreciative.

Thanks.</description>
