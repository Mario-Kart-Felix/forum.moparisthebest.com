    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-system-connot-find-the-path-specified-really-annoying/282350</link>
    <description>I always wanted my own RSPS so badly, i tried before like 5 months but i had a very small idea about HTML,Java,C++ but now after 5 months i learned much and took online courses and they were helpful, since yesterday im working on my own private server i had jdk1.6.0_13 and everything  was going so great until i clicked run.exe on a server and a message appeared

&quot;the system connot find the path specified&quot;

it was weird and i knew the problem was from the environmental variables and i worked hard to fix that problem but i didnt make any progress....


what i&#39;ve done:
1-i downloaded the latest version of jdk(jdk1.6.0_14)
2-i rechecked the user variables
3-i deleted the (PATH, CLASSPATH) and wrote them once again
4-i restarted the computer
5-i tried many different server sources

but nothing...


~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

if you think that the problem is not in env. variables then take a look at my steps
1-i made a no-ip host(testestest.no-ip.biz)
2-i downloaded no-ip duc
3-my router is linksys wg200g and i did that step about port forwarding as the tut says
4-i downloaded 6 different sources(4 of them 317 and 2 of them 508)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 please don&#39;t flame me or something but im still newb in this RSPS business.... :o

Thank you.

and here are some pictures that might help you and see if i&#39;ve done any mistake

              <p>So if you compile with my compiler it gives the error “cannot find the path specified”?</p>
<p>If it does, that means your environment variables are still not set right. I don’t know what exactly you’ve done wrong, but you need to start again and recheck everything. Make sure you put the right directory, make sure JDK is even installed properly.</p>
<p>I know you said you’ve already rechecked it but the environment variables are definitely wrong, you’ll just make to keep trying I suppose. Maybe the tutorial you’re following has a mistake in it?</p>
