    <title>Why Blacklists and &#39;Frowned Upon&#39; Rules Work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-blacklists-and-frowned-upon-rules-work/477492</link>
    <description>This video game truly does have some of the best communities I&#39;ve ever seen. World of Warcraft scamming is frowned upon, and Players get &#39;Blacklisted&#39; for doing it. Your R.S.P.S. will have much less Scams and wanna-be Con-Artists/Social Engineers/UB3RUB3RL337|-|4&gt;&lt;0R3r$|\|0|\|07R34LL&#39;/L0L - if you take measures such as the aforementioned. If anyone has questions in regards as to what exactly &#39;Frowned Upon Rules&#39;, and Blacklisting is, I will be more than happy to explain it.

This, however, may not be as effective for R.S.P.S. with modifiers, such as a high experience rate. The positives to doing this and forming &#39;Frowned Upon&#39; Rules far outweigh the cons though.



P.S. This is a followup on my Thread entitled &quot;Tips and Tricks on how to be a Dictator!&quot;.


P.P.S. Yes, before anyone asks, I let the person scam me on purpose to serve as an example for this Thread.</description>

<p>Which they can have if they put effort into it. A simple base is already in place for a part of this. You can use outside additions such as Forums to solidify your Blacklist as well.</p>
