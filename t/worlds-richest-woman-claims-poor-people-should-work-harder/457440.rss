I see that Merkel is doing what’s best of Germany, but the Greek, Spanish and Italians should do what’s best for Greece, Spain and Italy.</p>

<p>He dropped his support because he didn’t want to support the austerity package the government was planning. He agreed with most parts of it, but in the end he got scared of the reactions from the Dutch citizens. He’ll never tell the truth about it though, and no politician nor most of the voters take him serious.</p>
<p>You either put pressure on Greece and force them to comply with the promises they made, or you let them take their time and they’ll comply with their promises much later. The former is the best for the European countries, except Greece. The latter is best for Greece, but it could cause a domino effect and we’ll be rescuing Spain and Italy next. I don’t know if that will happen, but I wouldn’t want to risk it. On the other hand, I wonder if Greece will be able to comply, even if all Greek citizens supported the measures. Of course it isn’t ‘left wing’ to force Greece to cut their deficit, but I’d put part of the blame of the deficit on the left wing. Greece has been a leftist country for quite some time now. Germany on the other hand is centre-right, and is doing great.</p>

              <p>A socialist defending Geert Wilders. This has to be newsworthy! Besides, the influence of Wilders is minimal these days, and his ideas are just ridiculous.

Germany is our largest customer, and our economy depends on export. If Germany is doing good, then we are doing good.</p>
<p>The Euro-crisis is a difficult subject, and isn’t something you can discuss easily. One of the problems is that leaders want to appear strong to their own electorate, whilst also trying to fix the crisis. You can’t do both though, so we’re heading nowhere.</p>

<p>RIP:<br>
“IMO, the distribution of wealth in most European countries is good as it is right now.”<br>
It goes downwards now, with an increasing amount of inequality and a German Reich (EU) imposing right-wing politics to help the south european countries. They interfere in elections (Greece) to get what they want. Europe isn’t perfect and it gets worse. It seems like if it hasn’t been for Geert Wilders, Netherlands would also have its economy dictated by Angela Merkel.</p>

              <p>Frell: While I’m against people getting rich by working hard and smart a short period and later exploiting people, I’m not attacking them here. I’m only speaking of wages now, not money gained by your company growing. I hope you understands that difference. I’m speaking of a way of wage control that makes the wealth of a company flow in a bit more fair way. I know that no American would support my other idea of fixing it (socialism). And you can’t cry about high wages with my system, as if your business have problem, you just have to adjust everyone’s wages.</p>
<p>What I’m speaking of is people like the CEO of Statkraft, who get too much paid, but is employed by an even richer owner. He didn’t build the company, so no he isn’t the one who look for nice places to build hydro-power plants.<br>
The CEO of the most successful Norwegian company Statoil, doesn’t look for oil himself, he have people employed to do it, and if things go bad he get lots of money anyway.</p>
<p>Small business owners doesn’t get hurt by this, they gain if the company gains money. As said earlier, the difference between the best and worst paid isn’t written in stone.</p>

<p>Finally one who support my idea :). Miners work their ass  off (or at least fat). Just look at Evil_. I’m sure his hour hours was much harder than any managers job. So he deserve at least twice the salary of any boss who only sits at a desk all day.</p>
<p>US have a big poor population, you are terrible: <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article32284.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article32284.htm</a><br>
You are better than Romania, but was isn’t better than Romania? You refuse to do anything about it. You refuse to look at any of the other countries who do it better than you. What you cry about is people isn’t working hard enough.</p>
<p>You are promoting yourself as the most hard working people in the world, yet you have a great chunk of poor people. Your logic doesn’t seem to connect with reality.</p>
<p>Your dysfunctional democracy is just making thing worse, as people are giving less money to charity so there is less food for the poor. A dictator would at least make sure everybody has enough food, so he don’t get an angry mob after him.</p>

              <p>R.I.P RSC: I don’t expect you to follow Norwegian news, but there has been discussion of lowering those ridicules salaries in state own corporations. That is the another side of the coin. To avoid bankruptcy you need to cut from the top.</p>
<p>As I said, the minimum wage would still apply. With the de “minimum wage” in Norway the other cleaning lady would still earn more than your sum. The worst job when it comes to wages are bowling alleys and similar, with an minimum wage of $16 per hour.</p>
<p>By the way, the CEO of Statkraft paid 51% of his income in taxes in 2010, so we make sure they pay their fair share. (I don’t have any numbers for 2011)</p>
<p>Somewhat simpler would be the $250.000 hard limit, but that would not give people incentive to raise the salaries of those who earn the least amount of money. We could of course raise the minimum wage and hope that companies have saved enough money by cutting the highest wages.</p>

Nobody can earn more than twice (Or 3x, depending on how generous you are) the salary of the person earning the least amount of money. This of course is adjusted to actual work hours and taken the real wage into account, to prevent any trickery.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s a stupid idea, and I agree with Frell. Take Statkraft, a Norwegian electricity company. Most of it’s power supply  comes from hydroelectric plants, so as far as renewability goes it’s one of the better companies. The CEO earns around $700.000. If the cleaning lady should earn 3 times less money, she’d still earn $233.000. That’s absurd, and would cause hyperinflation.</p>
<p>Besides, a cleaning lady working for a small business would only earn around $20.000, so your so-called wealth distribution will only result in more class struggle, only now cleaning lady’s driving cars will run over their less-earning counterparts who walk to their work because they can’t even afford a bicycle thanks to inflation.</p>
<p>IMO, the distribution of wealth in most European countries is good as it is right now. The extremely poor receive welfare and other forms of financial help, and the rich pay a decent amount of taxes that both funnels money back to the poor and still encourages people to aim for the top. CEO’s usually are assholes, but the layer directly below them, highly trained engineers and the like, should earn more money than the average bum because they are superior to the average bum (when it comes to doing the job they are doing). CEO’s earn a lot, but it’s usually in proportion to the revenue of the company.</p>
<p>Banks are cannon fodder these days, and they deserve it. But don’t use the same arguments you use against banks to attack other company’s.</p>

That is true, that is why we give them 3 times as much money. Do you mean that a therapist is more worth than 3 human beings?</p>
<p>It is not only me with such suggestions. Similar ideas is Hollande’s idea with a 70% taxation above a certain amount of money. Completely sane politicians in Norway have suggested to max salaries at $258.000 per year. My suggestion offers a somewhat more fluid and flexible system.</p>

Raising the minimum wage increases unemployment because it hits mom &amp; pop shops and other small businesses too hard.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’d like to see a proper study on that. In my (admittedly limited) experience, ‘mom and pop’ type places (such as the one I work for) are the ones that tend to pay above minimum wage. Minimum wage is for Tesco and McDonalds.</p>
<p>EDIT: In case my boss ever sees this: Mom&amp;Pop wasn’t meant to be insulting. I just mean ‘small business without a lot of employees. Please don’t fire me.’ :D[/quote]</p>
<p>The mcdonalds example is true. Of course if there was an exception, id be for small businesses being the only ones allowed to pay minimum.</p>
<p>But in both examples.</p>
<p>If min wage is $7, near end of labor budget (lets say $150 hr) for that establishment and they have 20 employees</p>
<p>raise min wage to $8 and theyll have to fire 1 employee, possibly 2 if they have to make small cuts.</p>
<p>Now imagine 892 establishments in 1 state for this single franchise (florida has between 800-950)</p>
<p>About 1.5k people out of work for just that single chain. Imagine this being thrown on every taco bell, ardys, mcdonalds, wendys etc throughout the state.</p>
<p>Legit mom and pop shops aren’t a franchise, and theyll just have a tiny helping staff and they’re usually pretty generous.</p>

<p>And georgia and wyoming probably have lower unemployment rates. Raising the minimum wage increases unemployment because it hits mom &amp; pop shops and other small businesses too hard.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>nothing to be statistically significant, wyoming is 8th lowest (the first 7th lowest unemployment rates are all the federal minimum wage with the exception of vermont) and georgia is the 8th highest, georgia is 23rd for median household income and wyoming 19th</p>
<p>the issue with the statement “lowering minimum wage means higher employment” is that there are dozens of other factors to be considered, such as increasing the minimum wage = potentially more income to spend and to be reinvested into the economy, there’s also the fact that if a business is having to lay off workers because of an increase in minimum wage then they REALLY aren’t doing that well financially to begin with</p>

<p>And restaurants that hog tips are very very rare to find. Those that do don’t have alot of waiters, they all go other places.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>ideally they would, it definitely isn’t an option available to most</p>
<p>somewhat unrelated though, let’s take an example of someone receiving welfare for whatever reason and they get a job waiting where the restaurant hogs the tips, would you be for or against that person receiving welfare again if they quit that job because the managers were hogging tips? the common argument is that people on welfare shouldn’t receive it if they quit or turn down jobs, not usually addressing the fact that not everyone quits a job because they’re lazy for instance</p>
