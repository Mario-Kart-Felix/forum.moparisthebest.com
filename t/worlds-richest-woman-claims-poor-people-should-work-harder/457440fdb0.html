        <p>Another alternative if you don’t want to raise the minimum wage.<br>
Nobody can earn more than twice (Or 3x, depending on how generous you are) the salary of the person earning the least amount of money. This of course is adjusted to actual work hours and taken the real wage into account, to prevent any trickery.</p>
<p>That means if you want to pay anyone $30 per hour, your minimum wage is $15 or $10 per hour. If you can afford to pay anyone $30 hour a hour, you sure can afford paying someone $10/$15 per hour.</p>
<p>For this to work there can be no state-level opt-out, and of course take into account any trickery. And yes, the regular minimum wage is still there.</p>

        <p>Thats stupid. If you run a complex that has therapists and you hire some teen girl to be the receptionist for near minimum wage but the therapist gets payed $100 an hour thats completely fine.</p>
<p>Why do you think people who own these businesses have ‘soo’ much money that little stuff like this is easy? On a macro scale even a $0.50 increase in minimum wage costs millions.</p>

<p>By a 3x formula the teenage girl would earn $33. That is completely fine as she is also an important part of the business, unless you can do without a receptionist.

<p>And I’m sure they could get a pretty good receptionist for $33 per hour, so no need to hire a teenage girl. You should go and apply for that job (shirtless).</p>

<p>Thats stupid. If you run a complex that has therapists and you hire some teen girl to be the receptionist for near minimum wage but the therapist gets payed $100 an hour thats completely fine.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>By a 3x formula the teenage girl would earn $33. That is completely fine as she is also an important part of the business, unless you can do without a receptionist. If you want to save money, lower the therapists’ wages. As all companies have to abide by such rules, every one in a high income profession suffers.</p>
<p>And I’m sure they could get a pretty good receptionist for $33 per hour, so no need to hire a teenage girl. You should go and apply for that job (shirtless).<br>
[/quote]<br>
And this is why you don’t run a country. Anyone can answer phones. Not everyone can be therapist.[/quote]<br>
That is true, that is why we give them 3 times as much money. Do you mean that a therapist is more worth than 3 human beings?</p>
<p>It is not only me with such suggestions. Similar ideas is Hollande’s idea with a 70% taxation above a certain amount of money. Completely sane politicians in Norway have suggested to max salaries at $258.000 per year. My suggestion offers a somewhat more fluid and flexible system.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:62, topic:457440”]Another alternative if you don’t want to raise the minimum wage.<br>
Nobody can earn more than twice (Or 3x, depending on how generous you are) the salary of the person earning the least amount of money. This of course is adjusted to actual work hours and taken the real wage into account, to prevent any trickery.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s a stupid idea, and I agree with Frell. Take Statkraft, a Norwegian electricity company. Most of it’s power supply  comes from hydroelectric plants, so as far as renewability goes it’s one of the better companies. The CEO earns around $700.000. If the cleaning lady should earn 3 times less money, she’d still earn $233.000. That’s absurd, and would cause hyperinflation.</p>
<p>Besides, a cleaning lady working for a small business would only earn around $20.000, so your so-called wealth distribution will only result in more class struggle, only now cleaning lady’s driving cars will run over their less-earning counterparts who walk to their work because they can’t even afford a bicycle thanks to inflation.</p>
<p>IMO, the distribution of wealth in most European countries is good as it is right now. The extremely poor receive welfare and other forms of financial help, and the rich pay a decent amount of taxes that both funnels money back to the poor and still encourages people to aim for the top. CEO’s usually are assholes, but the layer directly below them, highly trained engineers and the like, should earn more money than the average bum because they are superior to the average bum (when it comes to doing the job they are doing). CEO’s earn a lot, but it’s usually in proportion to the revenue of the company.</p>
<p>Banks are cannon fodder these days, and they deserve it. But don’t use the same arguments you use against banks to attack other company’s.</p>

        <p>R.I.P RSC: I don’t expect you to follow Norwegian news, but there has been discussion of lowering those ridicules salaries in state own corporations. That is the another side of the coin. To avoid bankruptcy you need to cut from the top.</p>
<p>As I said, the minimum wage would still apply. With the de “minimum wage” in Norway the other cleaning lady would still earn more than your sum. The worst job when it comes to wages are bowling alleys and similar, with an minimum wage of $16 per hour.</p>
<p>By the way, the CEO of Statkraft paid 51% of his income in taxes in 2010, so we make sure they pay their fair share. (I don’t have any numbers for 2011)</p>
<p>Somewhat simpler would be the $250.000 hard limit, but that would not give people incentive to raise the salaries of those who earn the least amount of money. We could of course raise the minimum wage and hope that companies have saved enough money by cutting the highest wages.</p>

<p>Finally one who support my idea :). Miners work their ass  off (or at least fat). Just look at Evil_. I’m sure his hour hours was much harder than any managers job. So he deserve at least twice the salary of any boss who only sits at a desk all day.</p>
<p>US have a big poor population, you are terrible: <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article32284.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article32284.htm</a><br>
You are better than Romania, but was isn’t better than Romania? You refuse to do anything about it. You refuse to look at any of the other countries who do it better than you. What you cry about is people isn’t working hard enough.</p>
<p>You are promoting yourself as the most hard working people in the world, yet you have a great chunk of poor people. Your logic doesn’t seem to connect with reality.</p>
<p>Your dysfunctional democracy is just making thing worse, as people are giving less money to charity so there is less food for the poor. A dictator would at least make sure everybody has enough food, so he don’t get an angry mob after him.</p>

        <p>Frell: While I’m against people getting rich by working hard and smart a short period and later exploiting people, I’m not attacking them here. I’m only speaking of wages now, not money gained by your company growing. I hope you understands that difference. I’m speaking of a way of wage control that makes the wealth of a company flow in a bit more fair way. I know that no American would support my other idea of fixing it (socialism). And you can’t cry about high wages with my system, as if your business have problem, you just have to adjust everyone’s wages.</p>
<p>What I’m speaking of is people like the CEO of Statkraft, who get too much paid, but is employed by an even richer owner. He didn’t build the company, so no he isn’t the one who look for nice places to build hydro-power plants.<br>
The CEO of the most successful Norwegian company Statoil, doesn’t look for oil himself, he have people employed to do it, and if things go bad he get lots of money anyway.</p>
<p>Small business owners doesn’t get hurt by this, they gain if the company gains money. As said earlier, the difference between the best and worst paid isn’t written in stone.</p>

        <p>runescape3dude: At what rate should a CEO be paid?</p>
<p>EDIT: That the CEOs in certain companies earns to much isn’t just my left-wing opinion, but the majority view here in y country.</p>
<p>RIP:<br>
“IMO, the distribution of wealth in most European countries is good as it is right now.”<br>
It goes downwards now, with an increasing amount of inequality and a German Reich (EU) imposing right-wing politics to help the south european countries. They interfere in elections (Greece) to get what they want. Europe isn’t perfect and it gets worse. It seems like if it hasn’t been for Geert Wilders, Netherlands would also have its economy dictated by Angela Merkel.</p>

        <p>A socialist defending Geert Wilders. This has to be newsworthy! Besides, the influence of Wilders is minimal these days, and his ideas are just ridiculous. They cost money, especially for those at the bottom of the income scale. Our economy is already dictated by Germany, but that’s a good thing. Germany is our largest customer, and our economy depends on export. If Germany is doing good, then we are doing good.</p>
<p>The Euro-crisis is a difficult subject, and isn’t something you can discuss easily. One of the problems is that leaders want to appear strong to their own electorate, whilst also trying to fix the crisis. You can’t do both though, so we’re heading nowhere.</p>

        <p>It is the his and his party’s Euroscepticism I support. Same way that I support Iran’s president in some issues. That doesn’t mean I support them as politicians.</p>
<p>Did I get it wrong that Geert opposed the Cabinet he first supported, in the issue of the policies that Merkel want to push to the European countries?</p>
<p>I’m not speaking of the crisis, but the stuff that are done to prevent that. Do I get it wrong that Europe is moving to the right in the political spectrum?</p>

<p>He dropped his support because he didn’t want to support the austerity package the government was planning. He agreed with most parts of it, but in the end he got scared of the reactions from the Dutch citizens. He’ll never tell the truth about it though, and no politician nor most of the voters take him serious.</p>
<p>You either put pressure on Greece and force them to comply with the promises they made, or you let them take their time and they’ll comply with their promises much later. The former is the best for the European countries, except Greece. The latter is best for Greece, but it could cause a domino effect and we’ll be rescuing Spain and Italy next. I don’t know if that will happen, but I wouldn’t want to risk it. On the other hand, I wonder if Greece will be able to comply, even if all Greek citizens supported the measures. Of course it isn’t ‘left wing’ to force Greece to cut their deficit, but I’d put part of the blame of the deficit on the left wing. Greece has been a leftist country for quite some time now. Germany on the other hand is centre-right, and is doing great.</p>
