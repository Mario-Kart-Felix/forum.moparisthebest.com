    <title>[PI] Adding a Difficulty Option</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-a-difficulty-option/468914</link>
    <description>[b]Description[/b]: Adding difficulty options that will alter the players XP rates globally, and their rare drop rates. The harder the difficulty they&#39;re on, the better their drop rates, but significantly lower XP rate. My conventions are terrible and packaging sucks. If it really bothers you that much, then when you add it, correct it yourself. :D

[b]Classes Modified[/b]: PlayerSave.java, Client.java, and PlayerAssistant.java

[center][b]This was something added to my server fairly quickly, and can be done in different ways.
If you like, do it another way. This was just a start ^_^

[/b][/center][u][b]First open up your Client.java and add this[/b][/u]:
This boolean saves to their character file, letting the server know that they have already selected their difficulty, not allowing them to change it afterwards.

[code]public boolean ChoseDIFF = false;[/code]
[b]

[u]Next, open up your server/model/players/PlayerAssistant.java[/u][/b]
First off, i am using an integer, which i found best for me. Depending on your level of skills you would want this differently. (Example would be wanting an enum, which i have no clue cause i suck at enums)
This works for the most part, so if people want it easy then this is the way. :D

But anyway, add this Int:

[code]public int Difficulty = 0;[/code]

Now find your addSkillXP method in the same file, then look for this:

[code]c.playerXP[skill] += amount;[/code]

highlight that entire line and replace it with this:
(beware, its a switch statement, oh my!)  :O

[code]if (c.ChoseDIFF) {
            switch (Difficulty) {
                case 0:
                c.playerXP[skill] += (amount * 1 / 1.00);
                break;
                case 1:
                c.playerXP[skill] += (amount * 1 / 1.50);
                break;
                case 2:
                c.playerXP[skill] += (amount * 1 / 2.00);
                break;
                case 3:
                c.playerXP[skill] += (amount * 1 / 4.00);
                break;
                case 4:
                c.playerXP[skill] += (amount * 1 / 60.00);
                break;
            }
        }[/code]

For that, there&#39;s 5 different difficulties to give players more options, if you want less, then simply remove  one or a few, or add more if u like. To alter the XP rates, just change what comes after the operator (the / specifically) The higher the number, the less XP is given. This will effect ALL skills, so bear that in mind. If a skill is too low in XP, then they might now get hardly any 
(if u get 60xp for a skill on the last one, you&#39;d get 1xp overall for that skill ..... so just make sure you modify it how you want your XP rates.)


[u][b]Now save and exit that file, and open up PlayerSave.java in the same folder.[/b][/u]
Now for loading, just  look for this:

[code]else if (token.equals(&quot;character-rights&quot;)) {
    p.playerRights = Integer.parseInt(token2);
}[/code]

And right after the } add this:

[code]else if (token.equals(&quot;ChoseDIFF&quot;)) {
       p.ChoseDIFF = Boolean.parseBoolean(token2);
} else if (token.equals(&quot;Difficulty&quot;)) {
       p.getPA().Difficulty = Integer.parseInt(token2);
}[/code]

Now the boolean and integer I had you add will now be loaded from their file. Just dont forget to add the saving -.-

Go Down some more in this file and look for this 
[code]            characterfile.write(&quot;character-rights = &quot;, 0, 19);
            characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.playerRights), 0Integer.toString(p.playerRights).length());
            characterfile.newLine();[/code]

and directly under that, add this:

[code]characterfile.write(&quot;ChoseDIFF = &quot;, 0, 12);
            characterfile.write(Boolean.toString(p.ChoseDIFF), 0, Boolean.toString(p.ChoseDIFF).length());
            characterfile.newLine();
            characterfile.write(&quot;Difficulty = &quot;, 0, 13);
            characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.getPA().Difficulty), 0, Integer.toString(p.getPA().Difficulty).length());
            characterfile.newLine();[/code]

the above will save the boolean and integer to the character files like I mentioned above, and will load it for that player when they login.
[u][b]
Next, adding benefits for lower difficulties. So open up server/model/npcs/NPCHandler.java
[/b][/u]Just a fair warning that I am stuck on using Switch statements now, rather than If statements and because i suck at enums. If it would even be possible for this. (probably is knowing my luck)

First thing and only thing to do here is replace this entire method:

[code]public boolean rareDrops(Client c, int i) {[/code]

with this:

[code]/**
    * Dropping Items!
    **/
    public boolean rareDrops(Client c, int i) {
        int rarity = 0;
        int TotalDropRates = 0;
        int npcDropRate = ((Integer)NPCDrops.dropRarity.get(Integer.valueOf(npcs[i].npcType))).intValue();
      
        /**
         * Drop rates for different difficulties :D
         * by King Fox
         */
        if (npcDropRate-3 &gt; 0) {
           switch (c.getPA().Difficulty) {
           case 0: // Easy
               TotalDropRates = 1+Misc.random(2);
               c.sendMessage(&quot;Rare Drop Rate: &quot;+TotalDropRates+&quot;%&quot;);
               break;
           case 1: // Normal
               TotalDropRates = 2+Misc.random(2);
               c.sendMessage(&quot;Rare Drop Rate: &quot;+TotalDropRates+&quot;%&quot;);
               break;
           case 2: // Hard
               TotalDropRates = 4+Misc.random(2);
               c.sendMessage(&quot;Rare Drop Rate: &quot;+TotalDropRates+&quot;%&quot;);
               break;
           case 3: // Extreme
               TotalDropRates = 6+Misc.random(2);
               c.sendMessage(&quot;Rare Drop Rate: &quot;+TotalDropRates+&quot;%&quot;);
               break;
           case 4: // Legend
               TotalDropRates = 14+Misc.random(2);
                c.sendMessage(&quot;Rare Drop Rate: &quot;+TotalDropRates+&quot;%&quot;);
               break;
           }
       }
       rarity = Misc.random(npcDropRate-TotalDropRates);
         
       return rarity == 0;
    }[/code]
    
This will also send a message letting the player know what their rare drop rate for that kill was. If you dont want it shown, just remove the messages.


How i made players choose their difficulty was through typing a command. Below are two examples of how this can be done through commands. I did NOT use npc dialogue upon login, though i might now, that i think of it. :D

[code]        if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;easy&quot;)) { 
            if (!c.ChoseDIFF) {
                c.getPA().Difficulty = 0;
                c.ChoseDIFF = true;
                PlayerSave.saveGame(c);
                StarterPackages.EasyStarter(c);
                c.GlobalAlert(c.playerName +&quot; has set their difficulty to easy&lt;/col&gt;.&quot;);
            } else {
                c.sendMessage(&quot;You have already chosen a difficulty.&quot;);
            }
        }[/code]

That would require you having to make an individual command for each difficult, or it can be done this way, which will only require one command:

[code]        if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;diff&quot;)) { 
            String[] args = playerCommand.split(&quot; &quot;);
            int difficulty = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
            if (!c.ChoseDIFF) {
                if (difficulty &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; difficulty &lt; 4) {
                switch(difficulty) {
                case 0: // Easy
                    c.getPA().Difficulty = 0;
                    c.ChoseDIFF = true;
                    break;
                case 1: // Normal
                    c.getPA().Difficulty = 1;
                    c.ChoseDIFF = true;
                    break;
                case 2: // Hard
                    c.getPA().Difficulty = 2;
                    c.ChoseDIFF = true;
                    break;
                case 3: // Extreme
                    c.getPA().Difficulty = 3;
                    c.ChoseDIFF = true;
                    break;
                default:
                    c.sendMessage(&quot;Please choose a number from 0 to 3&quot;); // Is this correct? lulz
                    break;
                }    
                } else {
                    c.sendMessage(&quot;choose a number from 0 to 3.&quot;);
                }
            } else {
                c.sendMessage(&quot;You have already selected your difficulty.&quot;);
            }
        }[/code] 

Lol after looking at that, that might be alittle long for most peoples taste lolz. But that will let you just do ::diff 0  &lt;---  like that.

This was basically just a quick thing to do for me, and was easy cause im good at some things, and bad at others, just like anyone else. So this mainly for teh noobies :D

[center][b]Yes. this just happened.[/b][/center]</description>

The harder the difficulty they’re on, the better their drop rates, but significantly lower XP rate. My conventions are terrible and packaging sucks. If it really bothers you that much, then when you add it, correct it yourself. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Classes Modified</span>: PlayerSave.java, Client.java, and PlayerAssistant.java</p>
<p>[center][b]This was something added to my server fairly quickly, and can be done in different ways.<br>
If you like, do it another way. This was just a start <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>[/b][/center]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">First open up your Client.java and add this</span></span>:<br>
This boolean saves to their character file, letting the server know that they have already selected their difficulty, not allowing them to change it afterwards.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>[b]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Next, open up your server/model/players/PlayerAssistant.java</span>[/b]<br>
First off, i am using an integer, which i found best for me. Depending on your level of skills you would want this differently. (Example would be wanting an enum, which i have no clue cause i suck at enums)<br>
This works for the most part, so if people want it easy then this is the way. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>But anyway, add this Int:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Now find your addSkillXP method in the same file, then look for this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>highlight that entire line and replace it with this:<br>
(beware, its a switch statement, oh my!)  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/open_mouth.png?v=5" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"></p>
<p><code>if (c.ChoseDIFF) {
            switch (Difficulty) {
                case 0:
                c.playerXP[skill] += (amount * 1 / 1.00);
                break;
                case 1:
                c.playerXP[skill] += (amount * 1 / 1.50);
                break;
                case 2:
                c.playerXP[skill] += (amount * 1 / 2.00);
                break;
                case 3:
                c.playerXP[skill] += (amount * 1 / 4.00);
                break;
                case 4:
                c.playerXP[skill] += (amount * 1 / 60.00);
                break;
            }
        }</code></p>
<p>For that, there’s 5 different difficulties to give players more options, if you want less, then simply remove  one or a few, or add more if u like. To alter the XP rates, just change what comes after the operator (the / specifically) The higher the number, the less XP is given. This will effect ALL skills, so bear that in mind. If a skill is too low in XP, then they might now get hardly any<br>
(if u get 60xp for a skill on the last one, you’d get 1xp overall for that skill … so just make sure you modify it how you want your XP rates.)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Now save and exit that file, and open up PlayerSave.java in the same folder.</span></span><br>
Now for loading, just  look for this:</p>
<p><code>else if (token.equals("character-rights")) {
    p.playerRights = Integer.parseInt(token2);
}</code></p>
<p>And right after the } add this:</p>
<p><code>else if (token.equals("ChoseDIFF")) {
       p.ChoseDIFF = Boolean.parseBoolean(token2);
} else if (token.equals("Difficulty")) {
       p.getPA().Difficulty = Integer.parseInt(token2);
}</code></p>
<p>Now the boolean and integer I had you add will now be loaded from their file. Just dont forget to add the saving -.-</p>
<p>Go Down some more in this file and look for this</p>
<p><code>            characterfile.write("character-rights = ", 0, 19);
            characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.playerRights), 0Integer.toString(p.playerRights).length());
            characterfile.newLine();</code></p>
<p>and directly under that, add this:</p>
<p><code>characterfile.write("ChoseDIFF = ", 0, 12);
            characterfile.write(Boolean.toString(p.ChoseDIFF), 0, Boolean.toString(p.ChoseDIFF).length());
            characterfile.newLine();
            characterfile.write("Difficulty = ", 0, 13);
            characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.getPA().Difficulty), 0, Integer.toString(p.getPA().Difficulty).length());
            characterfile.newLine();</code></p>
<p>the above will save the boolean and integer to the character files like I mentioned above, and will load it for that player when they login.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Next, adding benefits for lower difficulties. So open up server/model/npcs/NPCHandler.java<br>
</span></span>Just a fair warning that I am stuck on using Switch statements now, rather than If statements and because i suck at enums. If it would even be possible for this. (probably is knowing my luck)</p>
<p>First thing and only thing to do here is replace this entire method:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>with this:</p>
<p>[code]/**<br>
* Dropping Items!<br>
**/<br>
public boolean rareDrops(Client c, int i) {<br>
int rarity = 0;<br>
int TotalDropRates = 0;<br>
int npcDropRate = ((Integer)NPCDrops.dropRarity.get(Integer.valueOf(npcs[i].npcType))).intValue();</p>
<pre><code>    /**
     * Drop rates for different difficulties :D
     * by King Fox
     */
    if (npcDropRate-3 &gt; 0) {
       switch (c.getPA().Difficulty) {
       case 0: // Easy
           TotalDropRates = 1+Misc.random(2);
           c.sendMessage("Rare Drop Rate: "+TotalDropRates+"%");
           break;
       case 1: // Normal
           TotalDropRates = 2+Misc.random(2);
           c.sendMessage("Rare Drop Rate: "+TotalDropRates+"%");
           break;
       case 2: // Hard
           TotalDropRates = 4+Misc.random(2);
           c.sendMessage("Rare Drop Rate: "+TotalDropRates+"%");
           break;
       case 3: // Extreme
           TotalDropRates = 6+Misc.random(2);
           c.sendMessage("Rare Drop Rate: "+TotalDropRates+"%");
           break;
       case 4: // Legend
           TotalDropRates = 14+Misc.random(2);
            c.sendMessage("Rare Drop Rate: "+TotalDropRates+"%");
           break;
       }
   }
   rarity = Misc.random(npcDropRate-TotalDropRates);
     
   return rarity == 0;
}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>This will also send a message letting the player know what their rare drop rate for that kill was. If you dont want it shown, just remove the messages.</p>
<p>How i made players choose their difficulty was through typing a command. Below are two examples of how this can be done through commands. I did NOT use npc dialogue upon login, though i might now, that i think of it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p><code>        if (playerCommand.startsWith("easy")) { 
            if (!c.ChoseDIFF) {
                c.getPA().Difficulty = 0;
                c.ChoseDIFF = true;
                PlayerSave.saveGame(c);
                StarterPackages.EasyStarter(c);
                c.GlobalAlert(c.playerName +" has set their difficulty to easy&lt;/col&gt;.");
            } else {
                c.sendMessage("You have already chosen a difficulty.");
            }
        }</code></p>
<p>That would require you having to make an individual command for each difficult, or it can be done this way, which will only require one command:</p>
<p><code>        if (playerCommand.startsWith("diff")) { 
            String[] args = playerCommand.split(" ");
            int difficulty = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
            if (!c.ChoseDIFF) {
                if (difficulty &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; difficulty &lt; 4) {
                switch(difficulty) {
                case 0: // Easy
                    c.getPA().Difficulty = 0;
                    c.ChoseDIFF = true;
                    break;
                case 1: // Normal
                    c.getPA().Difficulty = 1;
                    c.ChoseDIFF = true;
                    break;
                case 2: // Hard
                    c.getPA().Difficulty = 2;
                    c.ChoseDIFF = true;
                    break;
                case 3: // Extreme
                    c.getPA().Difficulty = 3;
                    c.ChoseDIFF = true;
                    break;
                default:
                    c.sendMessage("Please choose a number from 0 to 3"); // Is this correct? lulz
                    break;
                }    
                } else {
                    c.sendMessage("choose a number from 0 to 3.");
                }
            } else {
                c.sendMessage("You have already selected your difficulty.");
            }
        }</code></p>
<p>Lol after looking at that, that might be alittle long for most peoples taste lolz. But that will let you just do ::diff 0  &lt;—  like that.</p>
<p>This was basically just a quick thing to do for me, and was easy cause im good at some things, and bad at others, just like anyone else. So this mainly for teh noobies <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Yes. this just happened.</span>[/center]</p>
