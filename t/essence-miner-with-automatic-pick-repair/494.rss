    <title>Essence miner with automatic pick repair?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/essence-miner-with-automatic-pick-repair/494</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been autoing with Impsoft&#39;s Essence Miner 2 for a while. It is absolutely fabulous script, but it&#39;s missing a feature: When pickaxe&#39;s head drops, it just keeps trying to mine.
Untill now I haven&#39;t found a single essence miner, that would repair the pick automaticly so I&#39;m asking: Does anyone know good essence miner (or random :p) that attachs dropped pick head to handle and if you know, could you please post it?</description>

<p>I think you should just shut up and stop acting so fucking cool and smart etc etc because you’re none of it. You come out of nowhere and start making half assed scripts then you act so smart kthx.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think your thinking about your own scripts. Like the hidepicker you couldnt get to fight cows, that would stop going after the hide it was on its way to pick up if a different one spawned while walking or maybe your chicken fighter that would get stuck inside of the farmers house or outside of the gate.</p>
<p>No clue what else you put out, if they was anything like those two, its no wonder you quit writing them.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>My scripts were great, I released most scripts and all of them were great and I had alot more ideas but the day Aryan stopped working, and the developers stopped working on it I quit working on it too. My chicken fighter was my first script ever, and in the other versions the bug was fixed and it was more advanced. In your face yo. My hidepicker could get to the cows and could pick hide easily, I ran the script myself and got around 500 cow hides. You are just jealous, too bad. Some day you might be as cool and good as me, I doubt that though.[/quote]</p>

<p>Cant have it both ways dork. You say you script good, yet say they rip yours and the scripts suck.</p>
<p>Which is it?</p>
<p>Personally I dont know either way about the scripts… ripped or sucking either way. I do know you are contridicting yourself.</p>

Interesting. I don’t want to name names right now, but alot of people hate them for ripping, selling and being jerks.</p>
<p>Quaility productes, as I said. All of them was ripped, they first scripts were also ripped, they managed to make half assed scripts with copy and paste.</p>
<p>You have compared the chicken fighters with xerxes one? And who are you that I should listen to? kthx. die. I am tired of idiots who have no idea about things saying crap all the time.</p>
<p>The worst thing; SELLING THE SCRIPT.</p>
<p>Hell if I get time I will go on and release all their pay scripts again for free <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

thats hard to believe that ruler_eric rips scripts… and there is a random that does this i thought… sometimes if your comp is laggy… then it won’t get it<br>

Lololol.  He couldn’t even rewrite his scripts for Sbot.  He just made a shitty port of his scripts.  Believe it or not, they weren’t that great.  You hear people boasting about his scripts all the time.  And his service is lousey, not to mention.</p>
<p>Don’t buy anything for Aryan.  Just don’t.  It’s not worth it, only because you’ll lose that in a while.<br>
Make your own scripts.  You’ll profit in two ways.[/quote]</p>
<p>Atleast, you agree on something I say.</p>
<p>Face it,</p>
<p>They are noobs, they make half assed scripts, they rip scripts, they work like 5000 on 1 script while most of us work 1 by 1 on 1 script. etc etc. I owned them for a while then I got bored. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Although i thought geno and ruler eric are good scripters i am starting to wonder after what everyone is saying. They charge ridiculous prices for scripts and even aryan itself. Are they even allowed to do this. Take someone elses program and sell it. Thats like someone maybe adding a plugin to scar then selling scar with the plugin. Its not right</p>

<p>Lololol.  He couldn’t even rewrite his scripts for Sbot.  He just made a shitty port of his scripts.  Believe it or not, they weren’t that great.  You hear people boasting about his scripts all the time.  And his service is lousey, not to mention.</p>
<p>Don’t buy anything for Aryan.  Just don’t.  It’s not worth it, only because you’ll lose that in a while.<br>
Make your own scripts.  You’ll profit in two ways.</p>

              <p>I’ve been autoing with Impsoft’s Essence Miner 2 for a while. It is absolutely fabulous script, but it’s missing a feature: When pickaxe’s head drops, it just keeps trying to mine.<br>
Untill now I haven’t found a single essence miner, that would repair the pick automaticly so I’m asking: Does anyone know good essence miner (or random :p) that attachs dropped pick head to handle and if you know, could you please post it?</p>
