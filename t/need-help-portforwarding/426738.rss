    <title>Need Help! Portforwarding :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-portforwarding/426738</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;m pretty much lost at this point...

Here is everything for files wise but I&#39;m still kinda lost at this point.

I have gotten both &quot;Client&quot; and &quot;Source&quot; files for the client.

Next, I got No-Ip account. Then, I made my someserver.no-ip.com account and the download and ran it. Then I got utorrent for it then made the connection.. Im lost after this. If someone has either skype or teamviewer and knows what im missing please..... I&#39;m begging anyone please to help me.

If you help me I would love to help you. If you have a server that wants to get it out there let me know and I will help you.</description>

              <p>What you need to do now is make another copy of the client for the public and change the ip in the client by using Ctrl F and searching for server in gui.java or client.java.</p>
<p>In addition, utorrent fails it only works for some people. Therefore, you would need to portforward through your router.<br>
To do this:<br>
start button<br>
search cmd<br>
a command prompt should appear<br>
type in ipconfig<br>
then look for default gateway<br>
type that into your internet browser<br>
it should go to your router asking for a username and password<br>
the username should be admin or administrator<br>
and the password should be admin, or leave it blank, or administrator, password, or whatever your brother put it as<br>
if you can’t get in pm me and ill teamviewer you or there should be a little button on the back of your router where you would need a pin or something and it says reset- this will bring it back to factory settings so you can login it</p>

              <p>dont use any third party to port forward…</p>
<p>go into your address bar and type in “192.168.1.1” (browser address bar)(might be 192.168.0.1 or .1.0 or .0.2 sumtin like that. (in the not next step but one after it is your dns server ip.)<br>
find out your password and user, u can just google “default login for (router name)” its different than your wifi login</p>
<p>after that find portforwarding page<br>
(next step not in browser)<br>
go to start-&gt;run-&gt;“cmd”-&gt;type in “ipconfig”</p>
<p>(dns server ip would be in here)<br>
your looking for your “I Pv4” ip address or network address… should be something like “192.168.1.#” # could be anything from 2 to i think 30.then go back to your browser and put that in your pf page. you might have to google “how to port forward with (your router type here)”</p>
<p>make sure u close utorrent wont work with that open</p>
<p>soz. i got a bit confuesing. u still need no-ip</p>

              <p>Well anything that requires router information, I can’t supply. I don’t own the router it’s all in my brothers name and he is one of the brothers who would not help me. He is one of the type of people who would say don’t mess with anything on the internet. Is that easy to use?</p>

              <p>I wouldn’t use the guide that told you to use Utorrent.
