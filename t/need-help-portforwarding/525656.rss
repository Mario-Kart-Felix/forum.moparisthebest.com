    <description>hey guys i&#39;ve been portforwarding for a while and i used to be able to get my servers up, but then once i got a new router [XFINITY] Router my server hasnt been working when i go on ( www.canyouseeme.org ) it can see my port but when i put no-ip into my Loaders.java and i compile i get a js5connect and on the progran (DUC 3.0) it shows a Ip (ROUTER/NAT) that is no where close to mine, is the ip (ROUTER/NAT) suppose to be the same as your default gateway ip.
i&#39;m getting really confused and i have no idea what to do i&#39;ve spent over a week trying to figure this out!

Questions
~~~~~~~
is there anyway i can get people to connect to my server by just putting my ipv4 ip instead of the no-ip?</description>

              <p>maybe your router doesn’t support upnp, or has it disabled? if that’s what you’re using to do the portforwarding…</p>
