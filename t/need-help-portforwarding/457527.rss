              <p>Here are the instructions, make sure you’ve done them…</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Start &gt; Run</li>
<li>Type in ‘cmd’</li>
<li>In the black box type ‘ipconfig’</li>
<li>Somewhere you should see IPv4 Address … Copy down the IP after that.</li>
<li>Open up any web browser and go to 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 (depending on your router)</li>
<li>It will as for a username/password combination. Generally the username is ‘admin’ and the password can either be blank, password, or admin. Those are the default values, if you’ve set a router password, that password will be the same for this. Username generally stays admin.</li>
<li>After you’ve logged in, direct yourself to the Port Forwarding section, sometimes in the ‘Advanced’ section.</li>
<li>Type in the IPv4 address you copied from earlier, enter port 43594, and select TCP/UDP.</li>
<li>Some routers have a checkbox saying enable, make sure you’ve clicked this.</li>
<li>Make sure it’s unblocked in your firewall.</li>
</ol>
<p>Redo that if it didn’t work, post a screenshot of how you have your portforwarding set up so I can assist you further.</p>
<p>This probably isn’t the problem, but make sure your server is online, and listening on port 43594, sometimes it can be 5555.</p>
