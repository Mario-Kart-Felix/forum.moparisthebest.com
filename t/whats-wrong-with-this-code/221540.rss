    <title>What&#39;s wrong with this code?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-wrong-with-this-code/221540</link>
    <description>[code]                                case 155: //first Click npc
				int NPCSlot = (misc.HexToInt(inStream.buffer, 0, packetSize) / 1000);
				int NPCID = server.npcHandler.npcs[NPCSlot].npcType;
                                faceNPC(NPCSlot);
				boolean FishingGo = false;
				boolean PutNPCCoords = false;[/code]
That&#39;s the top of it then it starts with all the wanneshop&#39;s and the npc dialogue&#39;s and such.  Well it used to work then one day i did something... but i deleted it now it won&#39;t work.  None of the shops or npc dialogues are coming up anymore.  And trust me it&#39;s not the shops because i have made a shops emote tab where you click it, it comes up with five options for shops, you press it and shops open.  So please help me with this... none of the npcs do anything now.</description>
