    <description>[center][b][u][size=4]Ripping Xbox Games[/b][/center]
[center]By GoD[/center]

This may seem like it&#39;s very complicated and like you need to have alot of things. But it isnt, all this stuff that is below is for a complete n00b to understand it. So, feel free to jump around if you know what im going to say :P.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to correctly rip any game, whether you have the game, or if you just downloaded it off the internet :P. Also, I am taking it one step farther, not only will I tell you how to rip a game, but I will tell you how to connect to your Xbox via FTP. This is very commonly used and is vital to know how to do.

[b][u]Requirements[/b]

[ul][*]A Modded Xbox (Don&#39;t have one? Look at the FAQ&#39;s)
[*]FTP access to your Xbox (Preferably Smart FTP) Download It [url=http://www.download.com/SmartFTP/3000-2160-10028635.html?part=dl-SmartFTP&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button]Here![/url] 
[*]Ethernet Cable (Long enough to connect your Xbox to your PC)
[*]Router
[*]Qwix (Download It [url=http://www.teamavalaunch.com/qwix/Qwix101.rar]Here![/url])
[*]A game which you would like to rip.
[*]And of course, a DVD Writer. (I hope you assume you need a blank DVD for this...otherwise you need help :P)[/ul]


[b][u]Step One: Connecting To Your Xbox[/b]
Ok so there&#39;s two ways you can do this. Either FTP the game to your PC, or download it from the internet.
Now here&#39;s how you would FTP it to your PC.

[ul][*]Your Xbox has an Ethernet Cable port on it, so connect your Ethernet Cable to it on one end, and on the other, to your router.
[*]Start up your Xbox, let it get to it&#39;s Modded Dashboard. Now, open your disk tray and insert your game.
[*]Open up Smart FTP, for address, type in your Xbox&#39;s IP Address (It should say somewhere on the dashboard, usualy 192.168.1.xxx. Now xxx can be between 100-140)
[*]For Username and Password, it is xbox. It&#39;s always going to be that.
[*]Once it has connected to your Xbox, go to the D drive. This is the cd drive, you will see a bunch of data on there. We are going to Download it to your PC.[/ul]

[b][u]Step Two: Getting The Game To Your PC[/b]

[ul][*]Now that your hopefuly connected to your PC, and in your D drive folder, lets move on.
[*]Right click on your D drive folder, select Download&gt;Direct&gt;Select Folder. 
[*]Now it will ask you were to download the stuff to, so tell it, I have a special folder on my PC especialy for games, it&#39;s a good idea to do this. Keeps you organized. :)
[*]Ok, so once you specify a folder, it will just start downloading everything in the D drive, which is what we want. Depending on how big the game is, this could take 10-30 minutes. But since you are directly connected to it, you should get around 10 mb/s.[/ul]


[b][u]Step Three: Creating The Iso[/b]
In order for your Xbox to read the data off the disk, you have to have it as an Iso. So if you have been just burning the data straight onto a disk, you need to read this.

[ul][*]So you have the game on your PC, lets take this stuff and make it useful.
[*]Open up Qwix. Go to &quot;Create Iso&quot;. You should see three options. I will explain what these are and how they work.
[b]Option 1.[/b]Local Folder - This is where if you have just the regular data on your PC, it will take the folder specified and create an Iso out of the data given.
[b]Option 2.[/b]FTP Folder - Here, it will take the data specified off of an FTP folder on your Xbox, and create an Iso out of this. I cannot seem to get this option to work, therefore don&#39;t recommend it :P
[b]Option 3.[/b]Convert Iso - Now let&#39;s say you download an Iso off of the internet. Well there is a slight chance that the Iso ITSELF could be damaged. But not the data (In some cases) So I recommend doing this everytime you download an Iso off the internet. Select the Iso you downloaded, then it will create a new Iso with the data off of the old one.
[*]Now that I gave you a little info about these options you can choose what to do yourself. It should only take about 2-10 minutes, depending on how good your computer is :)
You should now have a box like this...

[b][u]Step Four: Burning The Iso To A Disk[/b]
[*]Open up your burning software (I would suggest using Nero Burning Rom.)
[*]I will show you how to do this using Nero Burning Rom, but if you have other software, you&#39;ll just have to kinda bare with me and try to relate to what im doing. :(
[*]Now select Open, choose your Iso. It should now say something about burning it like an Image, this is good, this is what we want.
[*]Ok, so try to match these settings if you have a decent/good DVD Writer...
[IMG]http://i53.photobucket.com/albums/g62/Omfgurweird_83/Ripping%20Tutorial%20Pics/Burn1.jpg[/img]

[*]Now, if you have a decent DVD Writer and wanna play it safe, Or if you want a really good quality burn, use something like these settings...
[IMG]http://i53.photobucket.com/albums/g62/Omfgurweird_83/Ripping%20Tutorial%20Pics/Burn2.jpg[/img]

[*]Those would be the lowest burn speed that you can possibly do, because the slower the burn, the better quality is spent on the burn.
[*]Another thing on there that you couldn&#39;t see is, Verify Data. This is annoying, but is useful! You don&#39;t need to have this, but I recommend it. It just simply goes over the DVD when it&#39;s done making sure everything went smoothly.[/ul]


Now you just put the game in your Xbox and play away my friends!

[b][u]FAQ&#39;s[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;I don&#39;t have a modded Xbox, what should I do?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[b]Answer:[/b] Well, you can mod your Xbox, thats for sure. Here is a tutorial on how to do it. You will have to register to see it though :(
[url=http://www.x-h-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=194]Tutorial Here![/url]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do I absolutely need to have a router? Or can I just hook it up to my Network Card?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[b]Answer:[/b] For this, I do believe you need to have a router :( Best way to know is to try it and figure it out.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I downloaded a game off of the internet and I followed your instructions perfectly and it&#39;s still not working? What could be wrong?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[b]Answer:[/b] Well here&#39;s the thing, In this world there are two different types of Xbox&#39;s. PAL &amp; NTSC. PAL is a version of European and UK Xbox&#39;s. NTSC is USA Xbox&#39;s. Since they are to different versions, they require two different types of formatted games. So you might have downloaded a perfectly good game, but it was the PAL version, therefore your Xbox cannot read that format. And visa versa.

If in the act of modding your Xbox, you some how stupidly mess it up (Which is really hard to do unless you just don&#39;t follow directions.) DO NOT, I REPEAT! DO NOT BLAME ME! If you cannot understand the tutorial I have provided you, find another one yourself. That&#39;s all I can say.

This tutorial was made by me, Omfgurweird a.k.a ~GoD

Any comments are appreciated, If you have a problem, post it or PM me, or e-mail me, hell I don&#39;t care. Contact me somehow :P

[b]Answer:[/b] Well here's the thing, In this world there are two different types of Xbox's. PAL &amp; NTSC. PAL is a version of European and UK Xbox's. NTSC is USA Xbox's. Since they are to different versions, they require two different types of formatted games. So you might have downloaded a perfectly good game, but it was the PAL version, therefore your Xbox cannot read that format. And visa versa.
<p>If in the act of modding your Xbox, you some how stupidly mess it up (Which is really hard to do unless you just don’t follow directions.) DO NOT, I REPEAT! DO NOT BLAME ME! If you cannot understand the tutorial I have provided you, find another one yourself. That’s all I can say.</p>
