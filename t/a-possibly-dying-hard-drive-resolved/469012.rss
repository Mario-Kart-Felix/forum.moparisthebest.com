    <title>A Possibly-Dying Hard Drive [Resolved]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-possibly-dying-hard-drive-resolved/469012</link>
    <description>When I bought this computer, I had to buy a new hard drive since all of my old hard drives were IDEs (this one is a SATA). It worked fine for a while, until my computer started freezing randomly and then unfreezing. When I say freezing, I mean any programs that were trying to do stuff with the hard drive would lock up. The rest of the computer would work fine, like using the task bar, moving the cursor, etc... until whatever would go and either read or write files.

The weird thing is the problem stopped happening after a while and I was fine for a couple of months, and then it started acting up again. When it happens, usually if I let my computer sit for a minute it&#39;ll unfreeze for a while and then freeze again. If I restart it, one of four things happens if it doesn&#39;t start:

-It doesn&#39;t get past the screen where it checks what&#39;s bootable after the splash screen
-It gets to &quot;Starting Windows&quot; but the logo doesn&#39;t start to appear
-It gets to the &quot;Starting Windows&quot; but hangs after the logo appears
-It gets past the &quot;Starting Windows&quot; screen but hangs afterwards

And if I let my computer sit for a while without being used (as in a couple hours), it&#39;ll work. Any ideas on what might be happening before I buy a new one?

It may not actually just be Eclipse. Did you download any add-ons for Eclipse?<br>
Maybe you should try to get a different version of Eclipse (instead of Juno, get Indigo, or vice versa).<br>

[/quote]what? it’s true. For example, I have a 200ish gb hardrive, like 6 gb is reserved for the recycle bin.

              <p>I actually ran startup repair for once (which was really just chkdsk), since I would shut it down after it would hang at the boot screen. The first time I did it, it took a long time and I heard the hard drive “power off”, but the second time it finished very fast and I’m no longer having any issues. I still don’t know what the cause is, but it’s working… for now.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT: </span>This is going to sound very superstitious, but I believe Eclipse may be the culprit. This issue only happened when I was working on Rarity a few months ago - which I used Eclipse for when doing client-sided work. As soon as I started working on other stuff, it stopped. Funny thing is I started using Eclipse again a couple days ago - in fact, the same day my computer started giving me problems. It was working perfectly fine after it repaired itself tonight and as SOON as I opened up Eclipse, I heard my hard drive die and my computer started to hang. I don’t know why it would give me problems, but it’s the only thing I can think of.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Lin, post:1, topic:469012”]When I bought this computer, I had to buy a new hard drive since all of my old hard drives were IDEs (this one is a SATA). It worked fine for a while, until my computer started freezing randomly and then unfreezing. When I say freezing, I mean any programs that were trying to do stuff with the hard drive would lock up. The rest of the computer would work fine, like using the task bar, moving the cursor, etc… until whatever would go and either read or write files.</p>
<p>The weird thing is the problem stopped happening after a while and I was fine for a couple of months, and then it started acting up again. When it happens, usually if I let my computer sit for a minute it’ll unfreeze for a while and then freeze again. If I restart it, one of four things happens if it doesn’t start:</p>
<p>-It doesn’t get past the screen where it checks what’s bootable after the splash screen<br>
-It gets to “Starting Windows” but the logo doesn’t start to appear<br>
-It gets to the “Starting Windows” but hangs after the logo appears<br>
-It gets past the “Starting Windows” screen but hangs afterwards</p>
<p>And if I let my computer sit for a while without being used (as in a couple hours), it’ll work. Any ideas on what might be happening before I buy a new one?</p>
