    <title>RSPS - [%100-Complete] Anti-Noclip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-100-complete-anti-noclip/365599</link>
    <description>Well, i&#39;ve just recently I had a thought, and then, it came into a plan. I have an Object decompressing tool, which decompresses ALL object&#39;s from every Map-region on the server. For each Object that is spawned, a file will be created in a certain folder, with the Object ID, the Type of object, and the coordinates the object was spawned over created in the file.

Then I was thinking...

Using an Anti-Noclipping base that i&#39;ve created, I found that instead of reading off objects, and their coordinates through a single file, I can do it through [b]Several[/b] files. 

So, if this is the case...

I can use the decompresser tool, extract all objects that are spawned into files, with their IDs, type, and coordinates in those files, and then use the Anti-Noclipping base to read the files, and just simply use a code to declare if walking over those coordinates of which objects that are spawned, to stop the NPC before it walks over the said objects, creating an Anti-Noclipping system

This would be a perfect thing to add to a server. If this works, it may be one of the best updates to add to a server, and may be very helpful to some.

I&#39;m posting it here, because I want to discuss it with the MoparScape community. I want to hear about what you think about this plan? Would this be something worth trying?


Just imagine it...</description>

              <p>Implement the A* pathfinding algorithm, keep track of un-walkable tiles/object locations cached into region objects. Load the data for the region when a player enters that region, and release the reference to the region when it isn’t being used. This way, you save memory as you only have what you need in memory. Take the initial point and the last point that the client sends you in a walking packet as point A and point B. Plug it into your pathfinder, generate the path, and make the player walk it.</p>

<p>Very hard explenation. But from the part I understand its true.</p>
