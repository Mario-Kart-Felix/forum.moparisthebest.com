    <title>IRC Abuse</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/irc-abuse/470371</link>
    <description>This letter comes to you in the hope that it will find the place in your mind where rationality resides and where decency and sanity, coupled with a healthy sense of anger, will trigger appropriate action. With this letter, I hope to overcome the obstacles that people like Mr. tL establish. But first, I would like to make the following introductory remark: In asserting that his blessing is the equivalent of a papal imprimatur, tL demonstrates an astounding narrowness of vision. What conclusion should we draw from his over-generalisations? How about that his unedifying preoccupation with narcissism will make us dependent on twisted gutter-bloods for political representation, economic support, social position, and psychological approval by next weekend? Currently, he lacks the clout to force us to do things or take stands against our will. But faster than you can say &quot;honorificabilitudinity&quot;, he will have enough minions to set the wolf to mind the sheep. Honor means nothing to tL. Principles mean nothing to tL. All he cares about is how best to abuse his IRC OP powers by using it as a mechanism of fear.

It&#39;s never too late to bring tL to justice, and if you don&#39;t believe me then you should focus on the major economic, social, and political forces that provide the setting for the expression of a vile agenda. His true goal is to encourage and exacerbate passivity in some people who might otherwise be active and responsible citizens. All the statements that his confreres make to justify or downplay that goal are only apologetics; they do nothing to strike at the heart of tL&#39;s efforts to install a puppet government that pledges allegiance to tL&#39;s effrontive retinue. Leaving aside the behavior of other counterproductive, intrusive rotters, if tL&#39;s thinking were cerebral rather than glandular, he wouldn&#39;t consider it such a good idea to perpetuate harmful stereotypes. TL is astonishingly evil. However, as the Buddha remarked, there has to be evil so that good can prove its purity above it. I&#39;m sure that if the Buddha lived in modern times, though, he&#39;d also comment on how the culture of arrogance that permeates tL&#39;s crime syndicate leads many members to dupe people into believing that tL&#39;s mistakes are always someone else&#39;s fault. We can therefore extrapolate that you shouldn&#39;t let tL intimidate you. You shouldn&#39;t let him push you around. We&#39;re the ones who are right, not tL. Amid the babel of false tongues all around us, even basically good people sometimes find it hard to know what is right and what is wrong. May we never forget this if we are to deny Mr. tL and his helpmeets a chance to consign our traditional values to the rubbish heap of teetotalism.

The same can be said for stork too. I&#39;d like to ask them both if they even lift.</description>

<p>How can we overcome this communist agenda? The only way to avoid a reactionary and counter-productive stance is to initiate an open and honest campaign against the narrow-minded intellectual terrorism which he has propagated across the server. Those of us who stand united against the scourge of pseudo-narcissism should be able to demonstrate the role of the collective conscious and it’s inherent ability to return traditional values of the mopar community and culture to the center of the IRC and message board.</p>

But first, I would like to make the following introductory remark: In asserting that his blessing is the equivalent of a papal imprimatur, tL demonstrates an astounding narrowness of vision. What conclusion should we draw from his over-generalisations? How about that his unedifying preoccupation with narcissism will make us dependent on twisted gutter-bloods for political representation, economic support, social position, and psychological approval by next weekend? Currently, he lacks the clout to force us to do things or take stands against our will. But faster than you can say “honorificabilitudinity”, he will have enough minions to set the wolf to mind the sheep. Honor means nothing to tL. Principles mean nothing to tL. All he cares about is how best to abuse his IRC OP powers by using it as a mechanism of fear.</p>
<p>It’s never too late to bring tL to justice, and if you don’t believe me then you should focus on the major economic, social, and political forces that provide the setting for the expression of a vile agenda. His true goal is to encourage and exacerbate passivity in some people who might otherwise be active and responsible citizens. All the statements that his confreres make to justify or downplay that goal are only apologetics; they do nothing to strike at the heart of tL’s efforts to install a puppet government that pledges allegiance to tL’s effrontive retinue. Leaving aside the behavior of other counterproductive, intrusive rotters, if tL’s thinking were cerebral rather than glandular, he wouldn’t consider it such a good idea to perpetuate harmful stereotypes. TL is astonishingly evil. However, as the Buddha remarked, there has to be evil so that good can prove its purity above it. I’m sure that if the Buddha lived in modern times, though, he’d also comment on how the culture of arrogance that permeates tL’s crime syndicate leads many members to dupe people into believing that tL’s mistakes are always someone else’s fault. We can therefore extrapolate that you shouldn’t let tL intimidate you. You shouldn’t let him push you around. We’re the ones who are right, not tL. Amid the babel of false tongues all around us, even basically good people sometimes find it hard to know what is right and what is wrong. May we never forget this if we are to deny Mr. tL and his helpmeets a chance to consign our traditional values to the rubbish heap of teetotalism.</p>
<p>The same can be said for stork too. I’d like to ask them both if they even lift.</p>
