    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lol-wut-anyone-know-how-to-fix-this-is-simplemachines-lock-please/305921</link>
    <description>Well ive been running some forums called RunePal for about 3 to 4 days and yesterday i got this error for trying to add a co.cc domain

&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=16pt]Connection Problems[/size]
Sorry, SMF was unable to connect to the database. This may be caused by the server being busy. Please try again later.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Ive tried deleting and remaking a server database and it still doesnt work btw im using ulmb as a free webhost. The password user and database name are all correct and the settings.php and settings_bak.php are all set but i get that one error everytime.

Looking forward to seeing all your guys comments tomorrow morning, thanks bye!</description>
