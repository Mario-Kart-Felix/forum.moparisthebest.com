    <description>[b]Description:[/b] [i]Lots of people are posting &quot;Help me I got 100 errors&quot; and also on some replys in tutorial selection &quot;Your tutorial fails I got 100 errors&quot;. So will I hope this tutorial stop all of that questions![/i]

[b]Difficulty:[/b] [i]Its just find the line you have error on and find the bracked that is missing or wrong. So I say 1/10[/i]

[b]Tested Server:[/b] [i]Will work with any server/java script[/i].


I also use proper conventions. So I hope it don&#39;t look messy :P. Also I just made some stupid random codes, I just made this for the brackets and [b]NOT[/b] for the codes.

Alright, lets start with the basic. 

A bracket is: { and }

The { opens a code and } closes it.

So lets take a simple code:
[code][size=6pt]
public void example()
{
  if (examplelala == 1)
  {
    lalala = 1;
  }
}
[/size][/code]

You see it open 2 times { and close 2 times }.

So for another example I make this wrong code:

[code][size=6pt]
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;master&quot;)) 
{
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; 21; i++) 
  {
    addSkillXP(14000000, i);
  }
[/size][/code]

Now you see there are 2 open { and only 1 close }. 
[u]This will give 100 errors when you are compiling.[/u]

So under the last bracket of you the you shoud add {. So then it open 2 times and close 2 times.

Now a larze code, it all the time works exact the same.

[code][size=6pt]
public int getarrowgfxnow() 
{ 1
   if (playerEquipment[playerArrows] == 892) 
  { 2
   return 15;
  } 2 
   if (playerEquipment[playerArrows] == 890) 
  { 3
   return 13;
  } 3 
   if (playerEquipment[playerArrows] == 888) 
  { 4
   return 12;
  } 4 
   if (playerEquipment[playerArrows] == 886) 
  { 5
   return 11;
  } 5 
   if (playerEquipment[playerArrows] == 884) 
  { 6
   return 9;
  } 6 
   if (playerEquipment[playerArrows] == 882) 
  { 7
   return 10;
  } 7 else 
          { 8 
            return -1; 
          } 8
} 1
[/size][/code]

You see the int opens. And end on the end. I set a 1 on the begin bracket and a 1 on the end. The others are just opening and closing. You can see this verry easy because I used conversations(also I added figures after evrey bracket so it might be a bit easyer to read, DO NEVER DO THIS IN YOUR REAL CODES LOL :P just do it in your head there). Two styles of conversations: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,281929.0.html I am using the first one because its easyer to read in my opinion.

If you use the way I did it you can never get &quot;100 errors&quot;. Also when you are compiling and you got 100 errors it will say in the first error which file the error is in and also the line:

[code]client.java:144: illegal start of expression
        public int maxedStats = 0;
        ^[/code]

Then go in your client.java and hit Ctrl + G, it open a window where you can type the line, so type it there and hit &quot;ok&quot;. Most of the time it will go to the end of the code where a bracket is missing or wrong. 

Thanks for reading, I hope this tutorial was &quot;noobfriendly&quot; and stops the questions for the errors. Also i&#39;m sorry for my english i&#39;m from the Netherlands :)</description>
