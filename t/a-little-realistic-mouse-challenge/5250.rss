    <title>A little realistic mouse challenge</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-little-realistic-mouse-challenge/5250</link>
    <description>hi all, ive been trying to make an ideal mouse movement script that wont get my ass banned. Now i only run it for one hour a day or so to make sure its not the time online im playing, and im still being banned. What i have included so far.
-lots of different methods of emulating mouse movements, from a random line, to fitting quadratic, cupic, and quartic curves, lines that accelerate and decelerate, a combination of practically everything.
-off action movement (follow random objects and ppl while the scipt is waiting, example, mining)
-hover above next target (when mining, the thing anticipates where the next ore will come back)
-random numbers in every action
-pauses during movement
-overshooting target
-different speeds and acceleration

and, the sad thing is, 400 lines of script later and im still being banned.

recently, i came up with a new approach tho, instead of using numbers and complicated calculations to find different curves, ive decided to try make a mouse function that uses almost entirely logical opperaters. Theres still some adding and subtracting involved, but i dont try fit any curves, calculate the slope that the mouse has to move.

My challenge basically is to build perfect mouse movement script that wont get banned. (besides im pretty sure that right now they have a different tactic of getting scar uses banned, cause my current mouse movements are pretty damn good). O well, to break it down, i need suggestions on how to make my mouse movements better.</description>

              <p>interesting. im new to runescape, but not cheating. ive read all about how good rune scape is at banning ppls, and i sorta challenged myself to build an unbannable script. Theres probally one thing im doing wrong, and its probally catching them all out. I though that with all the anti cheating buzz and the tracing mouse movements i thought fagex would atleast be smart enough to do simple linear regressions, measure distance between mouse movements each time theyre checked to look for a consistancy, or atleast look for instant teleportations of the mouse. Obviously not, im curious as to what does ban me then. Lol. Actually, do u think rs is more likely to pull a mass ban to catch all those who trade with their mains, rather than ban characters as they come. Maybe thats why their not getting banned. I forgot to mention that all characters were banned during the mass ban not to long ago, and i havent started up again yet. Still building my mouse script.</p>
<p>O, btw, this will sorta be cool for anyone who cares. I started my mouse script this morning, and ill show u guys what ive got so far.</p>

<p>dont be too expectant of it, but there are a few things you can play around with. This is a different mouse system than the ones ive seen in the past. Its based around logic, not complex equations. As youll probally see, the core of the mouse movement is really really simple, but the other parts arent quite so simple. U can play around with a few things. In the main loop, you can change curangle. this is effectively the start angle, and the script will work from this angle and adjust itself until it hits the target angle. Then theres rate, which affects how many degrees it can turn at a time. It still needs lots of work, but open up paint and let it draw u a line <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>mouse mousement doesn’t alert the banning system on it’s own. At SRL, we have many recent examples of scripts running nonstop for dozens upon dozens of hours without ban.

I have run scripts for 24 hours straight where the mouse has been moving like lightning in straight lines… not a single character banned from those 10 characters to this day.</p>
