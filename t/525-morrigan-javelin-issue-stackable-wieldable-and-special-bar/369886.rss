    <description>Okay so I have this 525 source that I&#39;m helping a friend code and I&#39;m trying to add Morrigan Javelin special attack and make the javelins stackable and wieldable. I&#39;m sorry to say I have no clue what the base is. Please anyone help x) Just give me a general idea of where to start. I&#39;ve looked at numerous tutorials and none seem to relate the source I have.

 Please atleast reply to what you think is going on. Don&#39;t just read the topic and leave..</description>
