    <description>Hey guys,

The beta went well, i took a few suggestions and added them, I&#39;m still open to suggestions in game and ive decided to realise the game now and see how things go for playing/pking/skilling and such.

Before anyone asks, I will never add dragon or rune items into shop i feel it spoils the thrill of pking and the economy and it just sucks tbh.

the exp rate it higher than the actual exp im working on having it im open to suggestions on exp rate so feel free to give me your opinions on what you think work atm ive placed it to around 50x but will be dropped in the next few hours.

Black dragon located at lava maze, drops dragon, rune and runes.

This is slime, i did not want to stick to all the usual npcs that people use hes located near baby red and red dragons, he drops from rune to dragon also.

This is front page for client there no need to register your username on forums at the moment i will change if people feel it would be better but at a later date.
