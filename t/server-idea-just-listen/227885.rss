    <title>Server Idea. Just listen</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-idea-just-listen/227885</link>
    <description>Ok, we have seen 1000 different servers with the exact, unoriginal idea&#39;s. Leeched after leeched with nothing fun, nothing different.

We all know the best part of RSC was low-mid pking. What I am suggesting is to abolish the rest.

I know a lot of people like to skill, but they also like to pk. So here&#39;s what I think could work.

Have a combat skill cap. What does that mean? It means you make the absolute limit of combats at a mid lvl combat level, say 50 combat?

Have the server xp running at 1x the normal RSC rate.

Still keeping all skills, but as to keep it easy on pker&#39;s there will be a shop that sells food e.g. Mackeral, Trout, Pike and Salmon. All other fish e.g Lobs, Swordies etc. etc. would have to be fished to obtain them.

Deep wilderness would not need to be ventured into, there will be no &quot;big, mean monsters&quot; that drop &quot;custom&quot; items. It will be exactly like RSC as if higher levels did not exist at all. 

The game would run a F2P format, running no members items at all.

That&#39;s my idea. 

If you want to take it on board you can, or you can shrug it off and put up just another thoughtless lame server that will attract no players and be a failure like the rest of them. But hey, at least you had admin for a bit right?

That is all, comments, discussion...all welcome.

Flame welcome, it is Mopar.</description>

              <p>Ok, we have seen 1000 different servers with the exact, unoriginal idea’s. Leeched after leeched with nothing fun, nothing different.</p>
<p>We all know the best part of RSC was low-mid pking. What I am suggesting is to abolish the rest.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people like to skill, but they also like to pk. So here’s what I think could work.</p>
<p>Have a combat skill cap. What does that mean? It means you make the absolute limit of combats at a mid lvl combat level, say 50 combat?</p>
<p>Have the server xp running at 1x the normal RSC rate.</p>
<p>Still keeping all skills, but as to keep it easy on pker’s there will be a shop that sells food e.g. Mackeral, Trout, Pike and Salmon. All other fish e.g Lobs, Swordies etc. etc. would have to be fished to obtain them.</p>
<p>Deep wilderness would not need to be ventured into, there will be no “big, mean monsters” that drop “custom” items. It will be exactly like RSC as if higher levels did not exist at all.</p>
<p>The game would run a F2P format, running no members items at all.</p>
<p>That’s my idea.</p>
<p>If you want to take it on board you can, or you can shrug it off and put up just another thoughtless lame server that will attract no players and be a failure like the rest of them. But hey, at least you had admin for a bit right?</p>
<p>That is all, comments, discussion…all welcome.</p>
<p>Flame welcome, it is Mopar.</p>
