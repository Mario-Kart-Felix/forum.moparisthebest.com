    <title>Need Range Guild Target Practice Script (willing to pay)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-range-guild-target-practice-script-willing-to-pay/33946</link>
    <description>The mini game in the range guild is completely repetetive, and should be easy to make a script for.  If anyone would be willing to make a script for me that worked, i would happily pay them for it.  I can explain exactly how the training works, and the series of repetitive clicks, as i have performed them thousands of times with my own hand.  So far its gotten my main character to lvl 86 ranged, but i would like a program which i could train a pure with.
Let me know if you can write this script, or if there already is one (i haven&#39;t found one).  Remember, if you can get me a script that works, i will pay for it.</description>
