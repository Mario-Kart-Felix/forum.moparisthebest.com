    <title>Assassins Creed - Views</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/assassins-creed-views/159147</link>
    <description>Completed the game yesterday. Very happy with it, generally. The sheer scale and amount of people in the three main cities is fantastic. Everywhere you go there is realistic life, and the plot is a great idea. The assassinations are really quite heart pumping, trying to sneak up, kill, run away and blend. I cannot get enough of this game. AC in HD is just brilliant. Everything is so crisp and very pleasing to look at. Some things I would mention, though:
- Too hyped up for what it ended up to be? I was expecting a little more from the game, but I&#39;m still very happy with what it is
- Bit short/repetitive - There are 9 people you have to assassinate. Each investigation can take up to an hour to do. What would be cool if you could investigate 100% by yourself. 
- Civilians say the same thing quite often, especially when you have to save them. I can&#39;t count how many times I&#39;ve heard &#39;Die thieve&#39;, or &#39;Please, wont somebody help me?&#39;. 
- Guards seem to be always suspecting you. Maybe it&#39;s because you&#39;re a hooded man, carrying six weapons, but they are always suspicious. 
- Some features that would make the game a solid 9/10 would be
* Carrying dead bodies
* More control over fighting
* More assassinations

Generally, I&#39;d give the game an 8/10. No online features, and limited controls can get annoying, however, the fighting doesn&#39;t get too bad when you realise that repeatedly pressing square wont get you anywhere. 

Try it, then buy it, imo...</description>
