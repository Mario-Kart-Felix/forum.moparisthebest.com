    <title>Considering playing again</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/considering-playing-again/430663</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been seeing all of these posts in this section, and I&#39;m kind of wanting to play again, but I simply can&#39;t get past the changes they&#39;ve implemented recently.

If I did play again, I would probably be F2P only (or at the very least, until most of the F2P skills are high-level).

Recently, I&#39;ve gone and implemented a lot of the vanilla features into my server, just to play something that [b]isn&#39;t[/b] the Jagex implementation.

I know that playing is ultimately up to me, but what are your opinions?</description>

              <p>It’s not worth playing it. The game is just terrible now.<br>
The only fun thing I enjoy about playing is glitching the game and recovering old accounts.</p>

              <p>I know what you mean Zyle. It’s either you have to up with RS’s crappy new graphics/features…or…remake what you loved and add the stuff you wish they had added. But if you choose the second it gets very very lonely (</p>
<p>I suggest playing RS about an hour or two a day then work on rsps the rest of the time <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> That way it helps to feed that desire but not overcome it.</p>

              <p>I’ve been seeing all of these posts in this section, and I’m kind of wanting to play again, but I simply can’t get past the changes they’ve implemented recently.</p>
<p>If I did play again, I would probably be F2P only (or at the very least, until most of the F2P skills are high-level).</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve gone and implemented a lot of the vanilla features into my server, just to play something that <span class="bbcode-b">isn’t</span> the Jagex implementation.</p>
<p>I know that playing is ultimately up to me, but what are your opinions?</p>
