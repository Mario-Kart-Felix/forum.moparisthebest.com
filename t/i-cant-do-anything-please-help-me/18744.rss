    <title>I can&#39;t do anything! Please help me!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-do-anything-please-help-me/18744</link>
    <description>I know that if I read the Rules carefully I would know about this, but I want to play Moparscape as fast as possible. When I log into my own server, I can&#39;t open anything e.g. doors, gates etc. I also can&#39;t talk to anyone, I can only move, and do VERY basic things. Can someone please tell me what I need to do? I would really appreciate it. Thanks!</description>
