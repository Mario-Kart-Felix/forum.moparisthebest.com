    <title>Whilst Making a Server... [Question]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whilst-making-a-server-question/85270</link>
    <description>[center][u][b]Hey and welcome to my thread[/b][/u][/center]

I just had a question sticking in my head and I thought I&#39;d see what you guys thought about it and what you&#39;re answers are.   :)

You can post in this format (much easier for me and others to read) or you can just simply post you&#39;re answer.

[code][b]Q : Whilst making a server, do you think it&#39;s better to have more in-game experience aswell as coding experience? [/b]

[i]A : [ANSWER HERE] [/i][/code]

[b]Q : Whilst making a server, do you think it&#39;s advantageous (usefull) to have more in-game experience aswell as coding experience?[/b]

[i]A : Personally, I do.  I think it&#39;s just as important as coding experience, it helps sort shops out, NPC drops, where to spawn NPC&#39;s, cool places etc.[/i]

That was my answer.  Give me yours!   :rolleyes:</description>

<p>Agreed.  I honestly think it’s a big factor in being able to code RS2 Private Server’s.</p>

<p>My answer : More coding experience and harder experience in-game + slow cash not more than 100m in 1 hour + more cool areas <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
