    <description>Wouldn&#39;t that be a pretty nifty idea? I believe one is already created, however it is not very large.

thoughts?

(this is for the single player seeds etc with world generation)</description>

I don’t even understand what these seeds are. Is it possible somebody could explain?<br>

By god if you are actually considering this, read this suggestion. Categories sorting in the style (EX: mountainous, delta (flatlands), etc), and whether its in snow or not.

<p>There wouldn’t be a need to upload the world, that’s the whole point of seeds basically.  So they would need to input screenshots (coordinates with each of them?), radio buttons to choose the ‘style’ (or check boxes,  would there need to be multiple choices or just one?), and a place they could write a paragraph in describing the map.  Then maybe a search option that would search for seeds and/or the description area?</p>
