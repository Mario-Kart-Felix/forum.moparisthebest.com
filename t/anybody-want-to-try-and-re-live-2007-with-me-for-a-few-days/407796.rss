    <title>Anybody want to try and re-live 2007 with me for a few days?</title>

    <description>Well, back in the day. I used to get random people, and ask if they wanted to make a pure &#39;twin&#39; account with me. This means, similar or almost exact username, same skill, same level everything.

I want to create a pure ranged or mage account with somebody. [b]Anybody in?[/b] No botting allowed, I want to do it with my bare hand.

More than one, maybe even a group. I can supply the basic equipment, or if you want too you can supply.</description>

              <p>Well, back in the day. I used to get random people, and ask if they wanted to make a pure ‘twin’ account with me. This means, similar or almost exact username, same skill, same level everything.</p>
<p>I want to create a pure ranged or mage account with somebody. <span class="bbcode-b">Anybody in?</span> No botting allowed, I want to do it with my bare hand.</p>
<p>More than one, maybe even a group. I can supply the basic equipment, or if you want too you can supply.</p>
