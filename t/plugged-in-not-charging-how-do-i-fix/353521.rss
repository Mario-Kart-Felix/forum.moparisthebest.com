    <title>Plugged in, Not Charging! - How do i fix?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/plugged-in-not-charging-how-do-i-fix/353521</link>
    <description>Hi i have a HP G60-213EM and i recently re-installed my operating system (Windows 7 - Home Premium).

I was running the exact same Operating system previously without any issues to battery life. However today when i plugged my charger in i noticed that the battery was not going up and was just staying at 13%. When i hovered over the icon i saw this text displayed
13% Availible (plugged in, not charging)
This has only started doing this today but it kinda defeats the object of me having a portable PC if i cant unplug it.

Does anybody know how to fix this.

I have tried Flashing my BIOS and restarting my Laptop, Taking the battery out. I cant find any other solutions on google though. 

Any help will be greatfully recieved. 

Thanks</description>

              <p>Does the laptop power on with the battery removed? If so, more likely to be the battery itself than the charging circuit, though you can’t really rule either out without a meter. How old is the battery?</p>
<p>EDIT: And of course try a different charger like the above guy said.</p>
