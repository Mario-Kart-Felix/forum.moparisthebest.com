    <description>This script is for when you get to the levels when the people run to fast to click them. Set the spell you want to cast and how many levels to do.

I realize their are a few things wrong with it like the amount of people that it counts that it thinks it kills isn&#39;t accurate. I just did that to see how many click it made.

If their are any ways that you guys can find to improve it or any problems you guys have, please tell me.

Here is a link to the game:

              <p>What do you mean it doesn’t do anything for you? You don’t need it? Or it doesn’t work?</p>
<p>And I know their is a script already, but that script was annoying to me. It was somewhat confusing…</p>
<p>Edit: I was thinking and may have realized your problem. Have you ever played the game because just starting the game and running the script will do nothing worth while. You have to build it up a little bit and buy a Mana Pool, this is where the recommendation of 250+ mages comes in.</p>
