    <description>Okay I am not a site developer or anything so some of you site pro&#39;s feel free to explain this in better terms...

Currently the way it is on here is like this:

-you go to an index section that is marked unread you will see the unread topics
-you can then go back to the main index board and it will show that board/sub board as read
-however if you go BACK to the board that was originally unread it will still show the unread topics. So in reality it did a false reading on the index for that reading on the main index... (I assume it&#39;s considering the sub board index read that&#39;s the reason)

My suggestion: to make it so you have the OPTION at least to have it stay as mark unread until you tell it otherwise. I can&#39;t even start to fathom the amount of times I may click in one section, go to one topic in that section, go to another board , go to a topic, and then have to find the original index I was in.</description>
