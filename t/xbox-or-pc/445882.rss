    <title>Xbox or PC?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xbox-or-pc/445882</link>
    <description>So,

I can finally buy a new console for my gamery needs but I was wondering.. I have a bugdet of $700 and I was thinking about buying a PC or an xbox360. For $700 I could get a mid gamers pc  (including monitor etc) to play games like skyrim on low-med setting. But for a cheaper price I can get an xbox 360 with lots of games. 

So, what do you guys think? What shall I buy?</description>

<p>Like I said once again… You didn’t have to buy a adapter you could of just bought a cable to connect it. Even when you had to buy them, it ain’t exactly like you can’t sell it afterwards.

<li>
<p>Regardless of the length between consoles, updatability is better than buying a brand new machine (console or PC).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A PC isn’t meant for multiplayer (locally) unless you build multiple machines on the same line (like an internet cafe). That would be the only reason why you would get a console, local multiplayer. Since I don’t have friends nor care about local multiplayer, I would love to be part of the mod community and enjoy my $60 ???-games-in-one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t see why this is even a factor though, besides having the best possible ping in tournament matches. Paying for online AFTER paying for my internet bill seems a bit absurd. Just a money sucker.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>You will need to buy a new console, when the new one comes out or you will lose out on all the new games. Compare that to a very well build gaming rig which shouldn’t need much upgrading if any you will save a lot more money over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could store all your games on a NAS, oh look now you can play your games any where that has a computer decent enough to play it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before they come out with build in wifi, you would need to buy an adapter for it. Also you still have to play on top of that for internet access.</p>

              <p>Depends on what u prefer… I’ve played consoles since I was really young and me changing to PC would just make it awkward and i’m just too lazy to try and play something I might not be comfortable with or be any good for that matter.</p>
<p>PC might be better but some people might like the simplicity of an xbox/ps3 or maybe their friends play it. I dunno, its your choice.</p>

Why did you quote me and saying its my perception because I did not say that because that would make no sense in this discussion… Opinions are based on many things, passed experiences and so forth… so yet another statement of yours is wrong. My opinion on the OPs question is the same as everyone elses as I have previously stated but THAT IS BESIDE THE POINT(2 posts in a row that i’ve said that, possibly more cba scrolling up) and it has nothing to do with what we are debating about.<br>
I’m not mentioning things as I’m not trying to argue what one is better because in reality none is better than the other unless you make the topic more specific also yet again it has nothing to do with whats being discussed.<br>
The last sentence had no relevance to whats being discussed also.<br>
Your misunderstanding every one of my posts, read them again and post again then post a reply. However if you yet again fail to understand my posts please do not talk to me and ignore me on moparscape(theirs a button for it somewhere) because you cannot understand me and theirs no point in communicating with someone you cannot understand?</p>

              <p>umm, because psychology is relevent with everything HUMANS DO. As I said perception, no idea how people aren’t making the link. Maybe I’ve been reading too much up on it and I’m thinking simple concepts are not simple at all… If you want to argue you, argue with someone who works in that department and they will prove you wrong I’m sure.</p>
<p>“video codec rendering” Video encoding/decoding rendering, sounds legit. I know it does those tasks but its not called that. I guess you could call it a container file with lots of mini tasks it does but then why would you only mention 2 and a half aspects of what it does?</p>
<p>I agree that a PC is better but that is not my point, I have said this many a time so your clearly either a) not reading my posts properly which means you can’t understand my posts fully or b) your not the brightest of guys or c) you don’t speak English as a first language.</p>

<p>Why the fuck are you describing psychology between a gaming pc and a game console when it comes to gaming?</p>
<p>Game consoles are designed to enable as an on-the-spot access to gaming. A gaming PC may be targeted at gaming, but of course, financially you get so much more. Document processing, video codec rendering (say you’re making a video), customizing your desktop, surfing the web at top speeds (in consideration of your ISP). You get all the abilities of a modern gaming console in a gaming computer, plus the benefits of the mod community.</p>
<p>I don’t have a gaming pc but I’ll tell you that PC is definitely better.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of features that the PS3 has in common with a gaming PC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Netflix</li>
<li>Amazon Videos</li>
<li>Internet Browsing</li>
<li>PLAYING GAMES</li>
<li>Trophies/Achievements</li>
<li>Save Data (Game Data)</li>
<li>Profile/Usernames/ID</li>
<li>Gaming Community</li>
<li>Store (Add-ons, extras, demos)</li>
<li>Pictures</li>
</ul>
<p>You can do anything the console does on PC, xbox or ps3. So enough with this psychology bullshit.</p>

              <p>If you just like the feel of a controller in your hand, then you can simply buy a joypad/use one of the many mods that make it possible to use ps3/xbox controllers on your pc. All in all, pc is a better deal, you get more customisation, versatility and gaming is way cheaper than on a console, and finally all the mods will give you way more gaming hours on a single game than maybe 4 games on a console (The Elder Scrolls games on the pc aren’t even comparable to the console versions because you lack mods, which aren’t that essential but can be a lot of fun, and the console which is necessary imo. given the amount of bugs that occur in TES).</p>
