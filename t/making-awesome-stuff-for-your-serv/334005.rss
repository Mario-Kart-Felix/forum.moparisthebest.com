    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-awesome-stuff-for-your-serv/334005</link>
    <description>[size=18pt]Stopped doing these for the moment... im sure davidi2 is starting up his own thread soon though, so be sure to check him out[/size]

[quote=&quot;Davidi2&quot;]You admit that they take less then 10 minutes to make?

I think that I might start doing this same service too.[/quote]
[size=18pt]And this is why ive stopped doing them[/size]

[quote=&quot;Davidi2&quot;]It takes no &#39;perfect graphical design&#39; skills to do any of this, and anyone with with a torrented photoshop could do it.[/quote]
[quote=&quot;Davidi2&quot;]Just to make sure, you take an image and then just add text right?[/quote]
[quote=&quot;Davidi2&quot;]If you can already make these background easily, then you are not doing it for the experience.[/quote]
[quote=&quot;Davidi2&quot;]If they are so quick why even bother doing this?[/quote]

[s]
Even though i&#39;ve quit rsps im still extremely happy to practice any graphic design work. I&#39;ve recently became MUCH better at grunge designs.

<p>Please argue the points ive put forward instead of repeating yourself.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Although I’m not sure what this argument is exactly about. I would like to point out one thing that caught my eye.</p>
<p>You say you’re doing it for the experience, but as a Graphic Designer, although I am not one but plan to be one, you shouldn’t just do it for experience. You should do it because you wish to ascend your skills further but at the same placing the client’s wants before yours. It is much better that if you were to make a banner for their private server, you would ask the client to provide screenshots of the server so you have material to work with.</p>
<p>Renders, C4Ds, Textures, Clippings, Masks, Layers. You don’t need a pre-existing image to make someone’s private server look good. If they can’t provide some legitimate screenshot of their server, you should deny their request because you want clients who know what they want and if they need it, they’ll get what they need to get it done.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t be biased about who takes your work, instead place it in a spot where people cannot see it. If you do then if you see someone take that image and put their name on it, you can just zoom in for them to show that you made it yourself. That way the banners don’t look so cluttered.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I like your banners because they have depth, but disappointed because they come from pre-existing images, at least some of them do.[/quote]</p>
<p>You say i shouldnt do it for the experience, but I do anyway. I find making backgrounds enjoyable and ive noticed that with each one my skill and eye for design has improved.</p>
<p>You say i should put the clients needs first, and i do. Im pretty sure that they have preference to a runescape backgrounds that actually suite what they want then a render with a brush as a background.</p>
<p>Thank you for the tips, but not needed. I am well aware of what i should do, i just dont.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>I did want to do it just to be nice, and as aforementioned, i believed it to be practice.</li>
<li>Youve posted about how useless and horrible the things i make are just because “people should get better than what they want from me”? why dont you ask them if they want me to stop making them backgrounds instead of coming along and saying that what im making doesnt take an ounce of talent until i cant be bothered anymore and stop?</li>
</ol>
<p>Please argue the points ive put forward instead of repeating yourself.</p>

<p>now please, the next time im trying to do something nice for someone don’t butt in and start verbally judging and abusing me… I mean, why do you even care about my reasons for making people backgrounds. Im not harming you or even getting in your way, so why even get involved.</p>
<p>Leave my thread.[/quote]<br>
I actually said you SHOULD do it, just don’t seem all high-and-mighty because you are doing it. Adding ‘bg by Demise’ to each background because you added text to it is rather sad…</p>
<p>If that’s not criticism, then please explain why you stopped.</p>
<p>If you wanted to do it just to be nice, you would not add your name to everything. And I may have judged you, but I never abused you except for calling you an ‘idiot’ when you said that I was posting all of these things so you would make me a background.</p>
<p>I care about your reasons because I think people should get better than what they are getting from you. And I get involved because I want people to know that they could probably do better than what you do for them, and then they can put their name on it and not have it say ‘bg by demise’ on it. Now personally I don’t see why you even kept the thread here if you stopped the service.</p>

I have an idea. If you can make me a GOOD client background (more than 5 minutes) that is better than my current one that I made myself, I will delete all of my posts/questions in this topic.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t think you should stop making these for people… you just need to tell them more things, and don’t brag so much about doing it. (And don’t put credits to yourself on the banners)</p>
<p>And I won’t be making my own thread, it was just a sarcastic figure of speech.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>well i didnt realise that this was all you were trying to fucking do.</p>
<p>all of that was so i could make you a fucking client background without my name on it?</p>
<p>gtfo. i’ll never help you again.[/quote]Ok you are an idiot… I never needed a background, and even if you made me one I would not have used it…</p>
<p>No, this was not at all just so you could make me a background. I just wanted to see if you were even capable of making things without your own credits, or if you could make a decent non-leeched one. I can make my own just fine, and I don’t need you yo make one. I meant everything I said and I was just trying to give you a way to redeem yourself by me removing all of my posts.</p>
<p>You never helped me before… so don’t try to make me feel sad or dissapointed by saying you will never help me again. I have never needed your help and never will.</p>
<p>Ok guys if Demise is going to stop making these just because he gets criticism (which he asked for) I guess I will make them for you if you want.</p>

<p>no it isnt. as i stated when i first made this everythings practice, even though this isnt taking much skill or effort it still gives me an eye for design and placements.</p>

<li>I’m sorry, but that just made me lol. Because guess what, those backgrounds that you leech and add text to were made for servers by graphics people.</li>

</aside>
<p>actually the backgrounds i use were made for runescape =] i wouldnt call it leeching if they are freely available, its not like im going to spend 3 hours drawing something, then 20 hours rendering it on photoshop</p>

<li>You can take pride, it’s the fishing for compliments that I don’t like to see. And I never said they were crap, I said they were fast and easy to make.</li>

</aside>
<p>i wasnt fishing for compliments, and you insinuated throughout your posts they were crap<br>
the only reason i wanted replies from people was to seek improvement or constructive critisim</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>You can’t ask me not to reply after responding… if you want me to stop replying, then stop replying back.</p>

<p>im hoping youll run out of things to say soon[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I most definitely agree that you are egotistical. But don’t even try to say you don’t think what you’re doing is awesome, because it says it in your title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can already make these background easily, then you are not doing it for the experience. If you really want to get better and be able to make REAL backgrounds and banners, start making harder things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m pretty sure that this comunities definition of leeching is: ‘taking something and calling it yours without giving credits’. Your background fit perfectly into that definition. You even wrote: ‘Made by Demise’ on some of them, when in fact someone else made the background and you added text. And I agree that you should not have to spend that much time for this service, but at least make sure the images you use are not copyrighted, and then give them credits. (Like size 2 text in the bottom right that has the makers name, needs to be readable, but not necessarily obvious)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, you were fishing for compliments. ‘START BEING MORE GRATEFUL OR I WILL STOP THESE’ is pure fishing. It’s not even subtle… And I don’t see you anywhere asking for criticism, and when you get some you go crazy and start a big argument (I ask ‘What’s the big deal’ and this argument starts).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m afraid not. I have plenty to say. And as long as I don’t break any rules I can go like this forever. (No flame from me yet. Just calm discussion :P)</p>
