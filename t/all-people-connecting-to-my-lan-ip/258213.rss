    <description>Hello, Moparscape Players.

I have a question, Why does all people connecting to my &#39;&#39;LAN IP&#39;&#39; ?
I made a other server, wich can be 1 player per 1ip.
But every1 is using my &#39;&#39;LAN IP&#39;&#39;
So only [b]ONE[/b] guy can play.
How do i fix this?

I did go to &#39;192.168.0.1&#39; .
I did go to &#39;&#39;Portforwarding&#39;&#39;&#39;And i done it -&gt; Working good
I did go to &#39;&#39;Virtual Server&#39;&#39; And i done it -&gt; Working good.
But every1 connecting to my LAN IP.


Thanks
Why :confused:
