and much much more

[b]We have updated the server everyday and are very dedicated to our current players and expect much much more. we have not had a player that has joined that said they don&#39;t like out server![/b]

and we  saved the best for last!!![size=10pt][b] NO LAG AT ALL[/b][/size]!!! please do not blame your slow computers as lag i just got a 16 GB ram pc with 2 tb memory and as soon as
we reach a certain limit of people and i will get a vps and as the community gets larger so will the capacity of the vps!


2 worlds EX0TiC Scape Original, EX0TiC Scape Pk (im not a big fan of the pk server. but I will run it for the ones who did like it on epicurus once i get it up to par with the original.)
vip&#39;s, supporters, mod, head mod, admin, head admin, owner, coder status&#39;s

I will hire staff according to the traffic the server aqquires the more players the more staff we will need

all donations go towards server for upgrades and expansions for more players with no lag etc (a lot of servers say this and don&#39;t mean it.) we mean it....

all bosses work properly (tormented demons coming soon)

all teleports work properly

main pk area&#39;s edge and green drag&#39;s!! pking is flawless.

I and my programmer are in the process of creating our own custom minigame the only info I will release is its name!!

[size=10pt][b]Team Dragonslayer!!!!![/b][/size]

and much much more!![/center]

Staff:
Owner: Stevo  (I will hire staff according to the traffic the server aqquires the more players the more staff we will need)
Coder(s):  Stevo, Riipiin, [size=12pt][u][b]IfearI[/b][/u][/size] (the rest of my credits will go to jayden himself)

Head Admin: Open
Admin: Open
[b]Head Mod: Vinny[/b]
Mod: Open
Mod: Open

Reason being, we are currently not a vps server yet, BUT!!!! we have already had 20+ players online running off of our brand new cp we had just gotten and we have yet to even think about lag or anything.
