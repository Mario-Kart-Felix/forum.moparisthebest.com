    <title>Firefox issue with webclient applet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/firefox-issue-with-webclient-applet/330360</link>
    <description>In previous versions of Firefox on Windows, loading the web client and then clicking on a hyperlink to move to another page would cause the browser to crash. This was especially prevalent on low RAM systems. (&gt;=2gb) On systems with higher RAM, the browser would not crash.

A similar issue would occur in Safari on a mac with low RAM systems. After several updates to Firefox, the browser no longer crashes but instead the applet loads and then crashes leaving the browser open but no longer displaying the applet. (Using a 3gb+ RAM system)

Internet Explorer does not have this issue, nor Chrome. On a mac, Safari does not crash and displays the applet without a problem. The mac version of Firefox suffers from the same problem as the PC version.

What is the problem here with Firefox? Can this be fixed within the code for the mudclient applet?

I see that RSCA uses JNLP to launch their webclient. Was this due to the same problem or a separate design choice? If the latter, what would be the reason why that client can load in the browser cleanly? Occasionally it will load in Firefox after multiple refreshes. Tried both below.


[code]&lt;applet name=DARScape width=800 height=535 archive=&#39;largeclassic.jar&#39; code=&#39;org.rscdaemon.client.mudclient.class&#39; mayscript&gt;
  &lt;/applet&gt;[/code]


[code]&lt;applet name=&quot;Application&quot; id=&quot;game&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;535&quot;
              archive=&quot;largeclassic.jar&quot;
              code=&quot;org.rscdaemon.client.mudclient.class&quot;&gt;
&lt;PARAM name=&quot;java_arguments&quot; value=&quot;-Xms128m&quot;&gt;
&lt;PARAM name=&quot;java_arguments&quot; value=&quot;-Xmx512m&quot;&gt;&lt;/applet&gt;[/code]</description>

              <p>Yes, their web client was stored locally and nothing else loaded within the browser window. Cache updates are stored in a single zip file which are then extracted. It uses MD5 to authenticate the updater so it can then download the package.</p>
<p>It seems to me that I may need to incorporate a similar set up to bypass the crashing applet problem and to speed up transfer of the cache.</p>
<p>I plan to stay small regardless of the threat of attacks. Any more than 20 players and it begins to become too demanding of my personal time to maintain. One of my favorite ways of keeping the player count under 20 is to ban those who donâ€™t appreciate the effort. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Meh, I might just set a cap with the world server at 25 players. I develop out of my own interest of learning and managing the game, not for prestige or fame. RSCA and RSCE have their niches and so does DARScape/KingPK.</p>
