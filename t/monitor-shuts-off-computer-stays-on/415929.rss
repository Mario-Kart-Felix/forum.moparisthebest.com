    <title>Monitor shuts off, Computer stays on?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/monitor-shuts-off-computer-stays-on/415929</link>
    <description>I have a emachine T2892..  I was having trouble with my processor underclocking, so I took my video card out (ati x1650) to see if it would run to speed.. It didnt, so I went to bios and restored to default settings.. It worked... 

NOW, my computer stays on and the monitor just randomly turns off... Its gotten to the point where it wont make it past the boot logo and its not the monitor... Ive tried a fresh install on it, but while I&#39;m in the middle of doing it, the monitor shuts off. I have plugged the monitor into the integrated gfx card on the motherboard and it does the same thing.

Help :(</description>

<p>EDIT: It does it with the nVidea card (integrated) and the ATI card (not integrated)</p>

              <p>I’m willing to bet the problem is with the software rather than with the hardware. Do you happen to run Windows XP? This same exact problem occurred on my dad’s PC a couple of months ago and after re-installing graphic drivers, modifying all settings known to man, and googling to no avail, I gave up and simply installed Windows 7 – it was time for an update anyways. No problem since.</p>
