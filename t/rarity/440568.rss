    <description>Welcome all. This is a server I have been spending a lot of time on, with my friend Jayden popping in occasionally to help. We&#39;re working on the project together, but apart from some handy code Jayden wrote, it&#39;s been mostly me so far. Anyway, our goal is to create a unique and fast server in C# filled with tons of content and after hosting it for a while, release it for people to use.

This project originally started as Project PONIES, but I scrapped it due to unknown bugs that made me tear the code apart and still not find a true cause. I then switched back to my old Lex 355 project, converted it to a 317, and started reworking its core. I made it much faster, and although there are still somethings I&#39;d like to change (like a packet system rather than the wL style of writing packets [outStream, inStream...]), I&#39;m very satisfied with how it performs and the way it&#39;s coming along.

Now, one thing I can assure is this project will one day reach a point where it&#39;s ready to be hosted. The only reason I&#39;m able to say that is, sadly, I really want money - for future reasons. My computer is dying and soon I&#39;ll be off to college and currently don&#39;t have much to my name. Though, I&#39;m not ONLY doing it for money - I&#39;m sick of reading about how all the servers out there are shit, and how they&#39;re all the same. Well, this will be different. Jayden and I have tons of plans, and one of those plans is to make donations [b]fair[/b]. I hated playing on servers where I had to donate or I&#39;d miss out, and I&#39;m still sticking to that. I want the word &quot;donations&quot; to mean &quot;donations&quot; to keep the project going. As long as people are willing to play, I (and I&#39;m sure Jayden is too) have no problem adding content.

So, with the backstory and history out of the way, I&#39;ll start with the current server features.

[b]-Smart world system[/b] - The world is made to optimize memory usage and performance when updating players and NPCs. It runs on a series of hash sets, including dictionaries for fast indexing and no unnecessary loops.

[b]-Clipping/Path finding[/b] - I based it off one of the tutorials available in the Tutorials section, since it already included all the map data and what to do with it. Saved me a bunch of time. Anyway, NPCs and players both have clipped path finding, which makes me pretty happy. I based my walking off Hyperion&#39;s walking because I didn&#39;t know how it worked and didn&#39;t want to spend time figuring it out and writing my own system.

[b]-Items[/b] - A simple-to-use item system. Ground items are also done (including showing timers and despawning), and so is equipment.

[b]-Weapons[/b] - Weapons are loaded from a file that contains data like their interface IDs, animations, hit delays, and more. It&#39;s all editable through the Rarity Data Suite.

[b]-Encrypted Saving[/b] - This was all Jayden&#39;s doing. The passwords are encrypted with some special format and it&#39;s really hard to crack. I guess security is a plus :P

[b]-NPCs[/b] - Obviously they can spawn from a file, but believe it or not, they can also turn directions! Amazing! They also walk around if their auto-spawning &quot;Walks&quot; property is set to true, in which case they only try to walk if within the viewing distance of another player. In other words, NPCs outside the viewing regions of all players don&#39;t get processed.

[b]-Skill requirements and Config stuff[/b] - Pretty straight forward.

[b]-Walk-to Queuing[/b] - Packets like item pickup, NPC action, etc... get automatically queued and don&#39;t actually get handled until the player is close enough to his/her destination. Bankers also work, with clipping in front of the bank booth. You don&#39;t see that very often.

[b]-Awesome interface/dialogue system[/b] - The object orientation of the two allow of controlled interfaces with their own properties but one simple way to use them. Dialogues automatically show the proper interfaces for lines, P&gt;N, N&gt;P, and P&gt;N&lt;P dialogue (the heads), and have something built in them to allow easy handling of what happens when the player &quot;clicks to continue&quot;. Also both types of chatbox interfaces are handled.

[b]-Most packets already handled[/b] - Yeah...

[b]-Full player and NPC updating[/b] - I don&#39;t think I need to really state this but I might as well.

Alright. Although there&#39;s more than that, I&#39;ll just stop there. We plan to have tons of content and hopefully a scripting engine for quests, and as you can see we&#39;re what seems quite far from that. But tons of progress has been made lately, and I&#39;m estimating a hosting date by the end of May.

The client will consist of custom items, NPCs, and animations, but preferably nothing later than a 508 game frame. I like 317s, but there isn&#39;t much past an abyssal whip and dragon armor. Makes it kind of boring. However, it will all be done right and not just poorly slapped together.

Here&#39;s some screenshots:

[img]http://puu.sh/rkNL[/img]
[img]http://puu.sh/rkPN[/img]

Not much to show, but it&#39;s all there (I know the face directions don&#39;t match. When a player logs in and added to the update list for other players, they automatically face down,  which happened in the screenshot). The main point of posting this was to build up hype and get beta testers later on. I&#39;m not accepting any requests now.

Anyway, thanks for support.

<p>As soon as paypal detects anything out of the ordinary, they limit your account. I have a friend who was sent some birthday money via paypal from his grandparents in Australia, and the next day his account was limited. It’s sad because I wouldn’t have minded donating a little.</p>
<p>Oh well, shit happens.</p>

Wrong. During NPC updating, only one movement type is sent. Not 2 like the player.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Wrong. <a href="http://pastebin.com/zLxx6tZh%5B/quote%5DTouche" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pastebin.com/zLxx6tZh[/quote]Touche</a>. I used existing servers for the protocol, and only the client for update mask formats. You’re right.</p>
<p>[quote=“sinisoul, post:62, topic:440568”]I suggest you use the ‘chunk’ unit coupled with final checks to assure that it’s within a certain range. A 3D array seems a bit much. Having the entire system relevant to a 2D plane with auxiliary checks on what z plane an entity is on would probably help cut down on cycles. You didn’t explain much about how the system looked in entirety.[/quote]Interesting concept, although I’m not sure if it would give many performance differences. I might as well just change my region system to be 8x8 and not 32x32 and create an even bigger region container. I think you might have slightly misunderstood what the 3D array is for.</p>
<p>It contains regions with the dimensions as [Height, X, Y]. So for example, region [0, 3, 4] would be 0 Height, 96 X, 128 Y. By having that extra dimension on there for height, there’s no need to cycle through player that have the same X/Y coordinates but are on a different height level.</p>
<p>I think what I’ll do for a new system is make each player have a list of players they need to add, and when one player moves, that player tells all the other players in a <span class="bbcode-b">34x34</span> area around them so the players only have to cycle through the surrounding players when needed. At most, maybe 30 players are moving around in an area at once, which is only 900 loops. I also might change the near players to be a hashset (unless I already do) instead of a list for even faster indexing and no O(n) operations. This was the original plan, but I didn’t expect the current system to give such bad performance so I scrapped it. Thanks for your input.</p>
