It is color’d enough? I got 4-5 different colors on there, if I had more, it would distract the user.</p>

<p>why should you care about other freelance web designers there prices are not very reasonable.

4-8 hours is much time you know. I’m always busy with school, sports, and so on. And the reason is why you should care about other freelancers: they make a living off it.[/quote]<br>
Not really because its not a straight 4-8 hours i included time for breaks nd watching some tele as thats what i normally do half way through, and you should not care about how they make a living. If they stop getting there customers then they will change there job.</p>

why should you care about other freelance web designers there prices are not very reasonable. To be honest it would take me around 4-8 hours to design, create, test and perfect 5 pages so i would not charge anywhere near that. Although it would depend on the type of job that you are undertaking but if it was just html and css i would charge £50 max</p>

<p>I had a website who’s control panel had a wordpress plug-in installer, and the wordpress looks a lot like it. I cancelled it now, and the hosting was dot5hosting.<br>
Doesn’t matter tbh, was just pointing it out.<br>
It’s simple and nice, but it’s not booming enough to get anything higher than a 6/10 for me.</p>
<p>Here:<br>
Moderate banner<br>
Lovely Navigation<br>
Nice Colours<br>
Nice Padding<br>
Nice Buttons (facebook, twitter, rss, <a href="http://del.ico.us" rel="nofollow noopener">del.ico.us</a>)<br>
Nice Button Area<br>
Uncrispy font</p>
<p>Just get some type of unique logo, and put it on your banner. I’m not going to create one since I suck at it, although it seems like something pointing in a ~70 degree angle would work.</p>
<p>ex:</p>
<p><img src="http://i517.photobucket.com/albums/u340/Equeraide/asdasd.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>ofc don’t using that poorly vectored dinosaur i google’d, and use something that blends with the text.</p>
