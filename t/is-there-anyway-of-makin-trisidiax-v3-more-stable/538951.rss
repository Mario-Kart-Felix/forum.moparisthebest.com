<p>Add a cycle-based event handler and convert your events into that. Also, look into cleaning up the process() in Client.java.</p>
<p>You’re going to want to redo a lot of the server, if you truly want to be stable. Like Combat, for instance, that’s the worst part of trisidia.</p>

</aside>
<p>Using an event manager would be virtually pointless as they run on a 600ms tick, and as far as I’m aware a project insanity runs on a 500ms game tick. If you were to start utilizing things with a 600ms tick while your server is running on a 500ms wouldn’t that throw the game server out of equilibrium?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Pi runs at 600ms a tick, you can always change that in Server.java:<br>
cycleRate = 600;<br>
As far as I know, there isn’t a server running on 500ms a tick.[/quote]</p>
<p>From what I remember when I looked at a project insanity it was on a 500ms tick rate.</p>

<p>im sorry. there’s no other way. if you want to avoid this problem in the future, <span class="bbcode-b">do not</span> use project insanity, delta, allstar, or any other winterlove bases.</p>
