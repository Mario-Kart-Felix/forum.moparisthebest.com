    <title>Error connecting to server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server/355684</link>
    <description>Yes I&#39;m portforwarded. I even used the port checker and it said both ports are open.

Now when I change my ip on the client what do I put it to? My no-ip address? Or 0.0.0.0 I&#39;m pretty sure I put it my no-ip but when I do that it doesn&#39;t let me connect. Also do I have to change anything on the server or do I just change ip on the client please help me.

Thanks</description>
