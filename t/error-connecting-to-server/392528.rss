    <title>Error Connecting to Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server/392528</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using two machines to test out the client + portforwarding.

The portforwarding was done correctly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;solacescape.no-ip.org on port 43594 is currently Online&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I can connect using the client from the machine where the server is running - I moved the client from that machine to this machine and tried to connect. I then get the error message &quot;Error connecting to server.&quot; As if the client is offline. I have changed the IP in the client.java file, and there is no GUI files to edit. 

Any help is appreciated. ^^</description>
