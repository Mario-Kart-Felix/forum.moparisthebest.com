    <title>Error connecting to server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server/429886</link>
    <description>im using an edgepkers base and insidia x client, ive set my environment variables using EV setter, changed the ip on my client and setup utorrent to allow port 43594, checked on canyouseeme.org and it says it can see my service.

the only thing is that the cache downloader for the client is slightly broke so they have to put the cache in the c:/ themselves...

so whats wrong with it ? do i need to add something in my source or client to let other people connect ?</description>

<p>don’t let the players put there cache in there C: that could be one of the worst thing you as a server owner/hoster could do -__-, it could change you from having 25 players… to 3 players</p>

<p>Jagex places their cache in the C drive. What’s wrong with that? I think you are referring to manual cache placement.<br>
