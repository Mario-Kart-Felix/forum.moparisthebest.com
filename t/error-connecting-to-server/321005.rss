    <title>Error connecting to server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server/321005</link>
    <description>idk if this is the right forum to post on,
but i need help.
every single server i try to log onto i always get error connecting to server.
but one time i got invaild username and password so i just put a bunch of random letters and it still said that.
and i have my own server but no one can connect to it either.....
is it my computer?
or the client i use?
i can get on my server just fine.
is it because im trying to host mine through hamachi?
if it is, can someone come on teamview with me and help me set no-ip and port forward?</description>

<p>error connecting to server usually means it’s offline, are you trying to connect to servers with your own client or the client provided by the owner?</p>

</aside>
<p>i use my own client to get on.<br>
it works sometimes.<br>
im on one right now with my client.</p>
