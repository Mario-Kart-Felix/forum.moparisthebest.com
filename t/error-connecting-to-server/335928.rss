    <title>Error connecting to server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server/335928</link>
    <description>Hi, basically when people logout on my server they can&#39;t connect? It hasn&#39;t been hapening a very long time it started happening on a small scale i.e. 1 person when 30 where on, now it seems to be happening alot. People are having issues connecting yet it still remains at 100% uptime on Moparscape status pages etc. They can only reconnect when i restart the server manually (sometimes).

This is 317, based of old dds-specz v1.5, Any help would be appreciated. And i haven&#39;t edited anything to do with the Login really.</description>

              <p>Could you post your login method, seems to me that when the server gets X amount  of players the server gets clogged with to much information, thus forcing players to get rejected by the server.</p>
