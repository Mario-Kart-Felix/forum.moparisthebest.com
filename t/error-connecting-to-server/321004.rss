    <title>Error connecting to server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server/321004</link>
    <description>idk if this is the right forum to post on,
but i need help.
every single server i try to log onto i always get error connecting to server.
but one time i got invaild username and password so i just put a bunch of random letters and it still said that.
and i have my own server but no one can connect to it either.....
is it my computer?
or the client i use?
i can get on my server just fine.
is it because im trying to host mine through hamachi?
if it is, can someone come on teamview with me and help me set no-ip and port forward?</description>

<li>The servers are down?</li>
<li>For your server try portforwarding or <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>
</li>
<li>Pm me.  I can help on teamviewer.</li>

              <p>@ kicker862, i doubt it is their server(@ ricky james it isn’t their servers because i cant connect either so… it depends on which client you should learn more a bout clients) I bet it is since you are using a cheat client or a webclient try downloading their(the server’s) client and playing if ya cant connect then it is the server not all servers are the same ya know and as for ricky james do you what you are talking about cause i don’t think you do at all.Foir rick james here is a explanation since your not that smart about servers and clients:<br>
OK so certain clients go with certain bases.You can’t use a blurr client with a silabsoft-compatible server it just wont work.And as for connecting it will only connect through the ip you put if you put 127.0.0.1(0.0.0.0 or localhost) it will connect through that but if you put your hamachi ip or a no-ip such as blablaablaa.no-ip.info or something it will connect through hamachi no-ip or a vps.</p>
