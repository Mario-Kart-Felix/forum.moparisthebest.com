    <title>Error Connecting To Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server/474930</link>
    <description>Hey, thanks for taking the time to view my problem. So I have a server online, and I can connect to it, my co owner can connect to it, and any other player can connect to it, except for my admin! We really need to get him online! He is attempting to connect to the server the exact same way any other player would, but it just gives him the, &quot;Error connecting to server&quot; error. He is using Windows 7 64 Bit, if that helps at all. We are so confused by this! ANY HELP WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED!</description>

              <p>I just redownloaded the cache for him, and I updated his Java, as well as JDK. We also restored his computer to factory settings because we thought it might be a virus… I don’t know what else to try!</p>

              <p>Perhaps let him try to:</p>
<p>Delete the Cache<br>
Make sure he has the lastest Java &amp; JDK<br>
Try to login with an other account</p>
