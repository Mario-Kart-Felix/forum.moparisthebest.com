    <title>Error connecting to server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server/381095</link>
    <description>Okay guys, I&#39;m having a really annoying problem. I&#39;ve portforwarded correctly, I&#39;ve edited the client&#39;s GUI and client.java so that it connects to my server, I connect through localhost however, but that really doesn&#39;t matter because I can connect either way. But the thing is, when my brother tries to connect to my server through my client, an error message shows saying &quot;Error connecting to server&quot;. I can connect, but anyone else can&#39;t. How do I fix this?  :confused:</description>
