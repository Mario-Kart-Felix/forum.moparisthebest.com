    <title>Error connecting to server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server/477889</link>
    <description>When I give my friends my client to play, it loads for them and downloads the cache. When they try to log in, it just says error connecting to server. I have done everything correct that I know of, I replaced the ip&#39;s in server.java, gui.java and client.java. My port is open. I can log in just fine. No errors appear, it just doesn&#39;t allow them to log on. I am using InsidiaX as my base. Does anybody know what I have done wrong?</description>

              <p>I think all the ips are changed. I compliled.</p>
<p>it’s a static ip. InsidiaX. I’ll try changing the server file back to localhost.</p>
<p>EDIT: Looks like I did it right, I just can’t connect to my own server &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>did you portforward everything correctly? Re-check your static ip to make sure it hasnt changed.</p>

</aside>
<p>If it has any chance of changing, it’s not a static IP.</p>
<p>Static - Stays the same.<br>
Dynamic - Can change periodically.</p>
<p>On Topic: What source do you have? I know in some sources, you’re not supposed to change the 127.0.0.1, do keep in mind you shouldn’t be changing server files, just the client ones.</p>

              <p>Once again, did you make sure all ip’s are changed, because if you can connect and they can’t, then there’s one of these problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>You did not compile the client after all changes were made then released it to them.</li>
<li>You did not change ALL the ip’s in the client because in most situations there are more.</li>
