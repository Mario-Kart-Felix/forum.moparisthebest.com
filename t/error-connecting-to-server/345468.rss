    <title>Error connecting to server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server/345468</link>
    <description>Hello ,

I am currently experiencing a very strange problem. Yesterday I was playing on a private server ( silabgarza ) and then I logged out to let my little brother play. He was then unable to log in. Every time I try to log in , it takes about 5-8 seconds then it says Enter username and password and [b]Error connecting to server.[/b]

My friends are still playing so I know it is not a problem with the server. So far i&#39;ve tried with the web client and the client. Also tried directly from the moparscape webclient. It always say Error connecting to server. Every other private server it working fine except this one.

I really need help. Please post if you have any idea on how to solve this problem.

Thank you very much</description>
