    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server/272261</link>
    <description>Hey guys, me and a friend are trying to set up a server. But here is the problem, we&#39;ve done evrything we could but we can&#39;t let friends connect to the server. they get the error connecting to server.

Yes we have port forwarded.

I will update in a second with what we have tried.(My mate is offline at the moment.)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 10, 2009, 08:09:49 am[/size][hr]Oh god, wrong section. Please move mods.</description>
