              <p>First of all, stop spamming the board this many times. I look at the board and half of it is you, asking basically the same question. We are not here to feed you grapes and fix the server for you. If you continue, someone will report you.</p>
<p>Error connecting to server is typically an issue when you either haven’t portforwarded, or it’s trying to connect to the wrong IP address. Make sure your JDK version is up-to date. Obviously set your ClassPath and Path (I’m sure you’ve done that, plenty of tutorials if not). Make sure you’re trying to connect to the right IP (client-sided, Gui.java, EGui.java, or something like that should have an IP in there.) Portforward if needed, although you don’t need to if you are the only one connecting.</p>
<p>For god sake though, use the search bar.</p>
