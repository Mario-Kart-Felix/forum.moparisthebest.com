    <title>Error Connecting to server</title>

    <description>Hello,
 I am trying to log on to my Runescape private server. Every time I type in my no-ip and my uttorent is open, I get Error Connecting to Server.  I have tried different sources (no luck), but I was able to log on at a different house using a different router.  Please help me as I have been trying to log on now for 1 week.</description>
