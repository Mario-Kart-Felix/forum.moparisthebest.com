    <title>Error connecting to server</title>

    <description>Hi guys,
I have been running my own runescape private server last year succesfull without any trouble.

But now, since i got my new computer, and windows 7, and a router, i hardly managed to install JDK for my server. 
Now that i have got everything on a good line, i have one problem left.

At the end it says, on the webclient; Error connecting server.

I have tried adding the port 43594 to the windows firewall, and putting my virusscanner firewall off. But it doesnt help.
Anyone know what the problem can be?</description>
