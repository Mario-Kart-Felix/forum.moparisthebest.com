I Port forwarded, Put my IP in GUI.JAVA where it says this - (swapped 0.0.0.0 for my IP)

[code]System.out.println(&quot;connecting to update server&quot;);
			Serverip = &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;;
			sign.signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getByName(Serverip));
 			initUI();
		} [/code]

Then i COMPILED it, added to WinRAR archive uploaded it to uppit sent it to my friends and when they try to log on they get error connecting to server.

What am i doing wrong..?

Yes the server is online and yes i sent them the client with my IP in it I can connect to my own server because the client I&#39;m using is localhost but they cant connect to me and its getting really frustrating 

Am I susposed to put my IP somewhere else? I couldnt find anywhere in client.JAVA to put it and i read somewhere that you put it in GUI.JAVA sometimes instead. When i search 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0 in client.JAVA there are no results but if i search localhost i get this -


[code]	
            signlink.storeid = 32; //not really needed for us
            signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getLocalHost());	   
            method2(503, false, 765); //sets gameframe size
        }[/code]

And this....

[code] aBoolean959 = true;
	            
	   	    try {
	            signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getLocalHost());
                    }
		    catch(UnknownHostException uhe) {[/code]

Do I put my IP in either of those anywhere? Sorry for all these nooby questions this is my first time trying to make a server and its not my greatest experience


.. I cant deal with this i&#39;ve been at it since yesterday at 5pm (its 11:30am the next day!) When i wake up hopefully i get some replys.</description>
