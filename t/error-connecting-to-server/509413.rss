              <p>Yeah what he said ^<br>
Rswebclients and all those sites give you loaders to choose from and most sources don’t work very well with them. I recommend using jclienthosting.</p>

              <p>You’re putting a 667 on RSWebclients.<br>
Your problem is happening because that website only loads PI clients.<br>
Make your own web client or a download client.</p>
