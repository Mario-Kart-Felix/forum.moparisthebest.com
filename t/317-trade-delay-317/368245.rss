    <description>Could someone tell me either how to, or where i could find how to: Make a trade delay for new characters? I would really like to know. I am tired of characters spam logging and xfering to get free items. Would someone please tell me how to make a trade delay.

For ex. I want it so as soon as a person logs in for the first time it makes them wait 1hr before they can trade, and then everytime they log in it doesn&#39;t do it anymore, just for first times.

Can&#39;t believe I forgot to say this: But I think I am using either Delta or Devo. It looks, honestly, to me, kind of a mix of them. like its &quot;sM(&quot;&quot;);&quot; instead of &quot;sendMessage(&quot;&quot;);&quot; but anyway, please help!</description>
