<p>There is absolutely no proof that the drug is not addictive; you cannot imply that just because “everyone out there” believes that.

<p>If you’re going to claim something is addictive, you need to find proof. You can’t just say “prove it’s not”</p>
<p>Some people may use it compulsively or have a hard time to quit. They are a minority among all users. Some people are addicted to tv, computers, games, whatever. Those are the same type of addiction as one may have with marijuana. But it’s not a physical addiction, like alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, or heroin, etc.</p>
<p>There’s no reason for us to overcrowd our prisons with non-violent drug offenders, and force us to release child molesters and murderers early to make more room. Addiction is a health issue, not a crime. Lets help people.</p>
<p>I won’t ever claim anything as being completely harmless. But I form my opinions from credible research and studies. And not from ignorance. (not a stab at jc…) And I am especially not trying to convince anyone to start smoking weed, I am trying to get people to be sensible. I don’t think people under the age of 18 should use it.</p>

<p>However, most people addicted to drugs like marijuana will think that there is nothing wrong with them because it only affects their thoughts for a little bit (this is ridiculous because they are killing off brain cells). It’s not even the ‘getting high’ part that is bad (as far as I know), you are inhaling toxins into your lungs, and giving your brain harmful chemicals.</p>
<p>Also, being ‘sheltered’ has nothing to do with your opinion on illegal drugs, this is actually called having <span class="bbcode-b">common sense</span>. As far as I am concerned, I am the healthy one while you are not. If you don’t care about your future or your mental health, go ahead and do drugs.[/quote]<br>
It will kill you.</p>

<p>Well first, it’s not addictive.</p>
<blockquote>Myth: Marijuana is Highly Addictive. Long term marijuana users experience physical dependence and withdrawal, and often need professional drug treatment to break their marijuana habits.
<p>Fact: Most people who smoke marijuana smoke it only occasionally. A small minority of Americans - less than 1 percent - smoke marijuana on a daily basis. An even smaller minority develop a dependence on marijuana. Some people who smoke marijuana heavily and frequently stop without difficulty. Others seek help from drug treatment professionals. Marijuana does not cause physical dependence. If people experience withdrawal symptoms at all, they are remarkably mild.</p>

<p>and second, it doesn’t kill brain cells. Or not anymore then breathing oxygen does.</p>
<blockquote>Myth: Marijuana Kills Brain Cells. Used over time, marijuana permanently alters brain structure and function, causing memory loss, cognitive impairment, personality deterioration, and reduced productivity.
<p>Fact: None of the medical tests currently used to detect brain damage in humans have found harm from marijuana, even from long term high-dose use. An early study reported brain damage in rhesus monkeys after six months exposure to high concentrations of marijuana smoke. In a recent, more carefully conducted study, researchers found no evidence of brain abnormality in monkeys that were forced to inhale the equivalent of four to five marijuana cigarettes every day for a year. The claim that marijuana kills brain cells is based on a speculative report dating back a quarter of a century that has never been supported by any scientific study.</p>

</aside>
<p>Alright, you win this one. Smoking anything can be bad. But compare it to tobacco. The dried marijuana buds contain 33% of the tar that tobacco has. Compare someone then who smokes once every few weeks, to someone who smokes 25 cigarettes or more a day. Also, 90% of tobacco related cancer is not caused by carcinogens. It’s caused by radioactive chemical, Radium 226. Which is then broken down in your body to polonium 210 and lead 210. Marijuana does not contain these.</p>
<p>It’s not even close to as bad a tobacco. Why should tobacco be legal and socially acceptable?</p>
<blockquote>Fact: Moderate smoking of marijuana appears to pose minimal danger to the lungs. Like tobacco smoke, marijuana smoke contains a number of irritants and carcinogens. But marijuana users typically smoke much less often than tobacco smokers, and over time, inhale much less smoke. As a result, the risk of serious lung damage should be lower in marijuana smokers. There have been no reports of lung cancer related solely to marijuana, and in a large study presented to the American Thoracic Society in 2006, even heavy users of smoked marijuana were found not to have any increased risk of lung cancer. Unlike heavy tobacco smokers, heavy marijuana smokers exhibit no obstruction of the lung's small airway. That indicates that people will not develop emphysema from smoking marijuana.

<p>Wait, let me get this right. You tell jc22493 that he can’t just make statements without proof, yet you do the same exact thing numerous times?? A lot of people can take me seriously actually, I don’t know how you couldn’t.</p>
<p>It is addictive, if it wasn’t addictive you wouldn’t have been doing it for the past 6 years. You then go on to say that you know others who have smoked marijuana for 20 years, how does that not strike you as addictive?</p>
<p>Yeah, how many of these studies were for altered marijuana (whatever the fuck you call it)? I bet none of them were, the marijuana that you and others smoke is not the same as the marijuana that Americans smoked in the 70’s.</p>
<p>It’s definitely not common ignorance, if you want to keep doing drugs like you have for the past 6 years I can’t stop you. If you like paying however much you pay for drugs I cannot stop you. You’re simply killing yourself, not me, I honestly don’t care.</p>
<p>I never said that I supported cigarettes being legal, if I had it my way they wouldn’t be. However:</p>
<blockquote>The main threat with marijuana is the obvious health risks. Marijuana affects multiple parts of the body negatively, including [b](but not limited to) the lungs, brain, eyes, and genitals[/b]. The drug contains [b]twice the carcinogens[/b] of government-sanctioned [b]tobacco[/b] products and actively attacks the immune system of the lungs, leading to a near-cubing of the likelihood for [b]lung cancer [/b]in the user. It also induces severe hallucinations and[b] slows down brain waves[/b], leading to severe [b]mental retardation in mild cases, and Asperger's Syndrome in extreme cases[/b]. It severely hampers the users ability to drive, read, or recognize an incoming train. Lastly, it is confirmed in all reported cases to result in complete infertility and a decreased sex drive, which may be the only positive side effect of the drug. Worse, many of these effects can be passed onto nearby users through secondhand smoke.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Myth: Marijuana is completely non-addictive.
<p>Fact: Marijuana is not only 1000 times more physically addictive than heroin, but the side effects of the drug often lead to a state of poor decision-making, where a second “joint” seems like a good idea to improve the high from the drug. Due to the long-lasting effects of this mental impairment, it can be said that marijuana gets you hooked from the first use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, continue thinking whatever you want about marijuana, it’s your life.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@responses</span> to my metaphor:</p>
<p>Whoever said that you would be “severing many arteries” is very misguided, you would definitely live unless you lost too much blood.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’ll still stand by what I said, just because you won’t be killed by marijuana, you will be severed for life (this is similar to loosing multiple limbs)…</p>

        <p>Alec, your entitled to your own opinion and i respect that, although i must point out that marijuana is not addictive in any way shape or form. When i first started smoking herb I continued to do it everyday for two years and when i first got with my partner she asked me to stop when she got pregnant. So I did for a number of months but started back up out of freewil, my partner smokes it also and she agrees totally to what I’m saying<br>
here.</p>
<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention, if my partner didn’t lose the baby I wouldn’t be smoking it now, although she is pregnant again I still smoke, but not around her and when my baby is born. He/she will never be around me when i decide to spark up a spliff.</p>

<p>Yeah, how many of these studies were for altered marijuana (whatever the fuck you call it)? I bet none of them were, the marijuana that you and others smoke is not the same as the marijuana that Americans smoked in the 70’s.</p>

<p>There’s good weed, and there’s bad weed. This is always how it’s been. Sure we may have gotten better in the growing process over the years with the increase in technology, but why the fuck does it matter if it’s not the same as it was a few decades ago. Just because the potency went up doesn’t mean it went up enough to become dangerous.</p>
