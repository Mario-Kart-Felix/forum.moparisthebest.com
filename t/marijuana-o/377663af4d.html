<p>It is addictive, if it wasn’t addictive you wouldn’t have been doing it for the past 6 years. You then go on to say that you know others who have smoked marijuana for 20 years, how does that not strike you as addictive?</p>
<p>Yeah, how many of these studies were for altered marijuana (whatever the fuck you call it)? I bet none of them were, the marijuana that you and others smoke is not the same as the marijuana that Americans smoked in the 70’s.</p>
<p>It’s definitely not common ignorance, if you want to keep doing drugs like you have for the past 6 years I can’t stop you. If you like paying however much you pay for drugs I cannot stop you. You’re simply killing yourself, not me, I honestly don’t care.</p>
<p>I never said that I supported cigarettes being legal, if I had it my way they wouldn’t be. However:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main threat with marijuana is the obvious health risks. Marijuana affects multiple parts of the body negatively, including <span class="bbcode-b">(but not limited to) the lungs, brain, eyes, and genitals</span>. The drug contains <span class="bbcode-b">twice the carcinogens</span> of government-sanctioned <span class="bbcode-b">tobacco</span> products and actively attacks the immune system of the lungs, leading to a near-cubing of the likelihood for <span class="bbcode-b">lung cancer </span>in the user. It also induces severe hallucinations and<span class="bbcode-b"> slows down brain waves</span>, leading to severe <span class="bbcode-b">mental retardation in mild cases, and Asperger’s Syndrome in extreme cases</span>. It severely hampers the users ability to drive, read, or recognize an incoming train. Lastly, it is confirmed in all reported cases to result in complete infertility and a decreased sex drive, which may be the only positive side effect of the drug. Worse, many of these effects can be passed onto nearby users through secondhand smoke.</p>

<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Myth: Marijuana is completely non-addictive.</p>
<p>Fact: Marijuana is not only 1000 times more physically addictive than heroin, but the side effects of the drug often lead to a state of poor decision-making, where a second “joint” seems like a good idea to improve the high from the drug. Due to the long-lasting effects of this mental impairment, it can be said that marijuana gets you hooked from the first use.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Again, continue thinking whatever you want about marijuana, it’s your life.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@responses</span> to my metaphor:</p>
<p>Whoever said that you would be “severing many arteries” is very misguided, you would definitely live unless you lost too much blood.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’ll still stand by what I said, just because you won’t be killed by marijuana, you will be severed for life (this is similar to loosing multiple limbs)…[/quote]</p>
<p>hahahaha those quotes are from uncyclopedia. You’re basing your information on an article written for <span class="bbcode-b">comedy</span> purposes. It’s satire.<br>

I would definitely agree with you that there is a gateway effect. Like 100%. But marijuana is not a “gateway drug”. There’s no chemical in the plant that makes you want to try harder drugs. The gateway effects comes with the blending of the drug markets. Because it’s illegal you have to get your weed from a dealer, and most dealers who deal weed also deal harder drugs. So when someones buying their weed the dealer might say “Hey, wanna try something a little stronger?”. There’s your gateway effect.</p>
<p>You become exposed to harder drugs because marijuana has been grouped in with them. It’s not the actual using of marijuana.</p>

<p>Besides this,</p>
<p>1.(marijuana as a gateway to other drugs) “Analysis of the demographic and social characteristics of a large sample of applicants seeking approval to use marijuana medically in California supports an interpretation of long term non problematic use by many who had first tried it as adolescents, and then either continued to use it or later resumed its use as adults. In general, they have used it at modest levels and in consistent patterns which anecdotally-often assisted their educational achievement, employment performance, and establishment of a more stable life-style. These data suggest that rather than acting as a gateway to other drugs, (which many had also tried), cannabis has been exerting a beneficial influence on most.”</p>

<p>There is absolutely no proof that the drug is not addictive; you cannot imply that just because “everyone out there” believes that. You also cannot state that it isn’t addictive when a small percentage of the population of marijuana users is in fact psychologically dependent on the drug.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Habit forming is not the same as addictive. Everything we do is habit forming. Absolutely no basis for making it illegal. Until there is proof that it is addictive I will assume it is not addictive. I can easily stop smoking for months with it having no effect on me.[/quote]<br>
Likewise. “Until there is proof that it is not addictive, I will assume it is addictive.” It can go both ways. I’m not blaming you for believing any specific thing, for I may be wrong, but basing our information off skewed textbooks and other “reliable” resources isn’t enough to prove anything, especially when talking about an issue this controversial. As for “I can stop anytime and it will have no effect on me,” of course all users are going to defend themselves with that argument, but I can swear on my grandparents’ lives that you would long for it if you lacked it.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/jme.html">@jme</a>: I think it goes both ways. I can’t prove that marijuana is addictive, but the users of marijuana who argue that it is not addictive cannot prove that either, so this debate will always be at a stalemate. Furthermore, research in this area is informational, but only to a certain extent. Some research states that it is not addictive, while others state that it is addictive, such as the first link that came up on Google when I searched “Is marijuana addictive?”… Of course I’m being a bit biased by using sources that support my side, but isn’t that what everyone else is doing?</p>

<p>I’ve dealt with real addictions. Coffee, tobacco, cocaine almost… Marijuana isn’t a real addiction.</p>
<p>I hope we can both agree on something though. Marijuana is not a physical addiction. It’s addictive in the way that games like minecraft are. Because if something is enjoyable, we as humans we will want to repeat it. But that’s as far as it goes.</p>
<p>But when you quit, there’s no withdrawels. For example I had a lung infection not long ago, so I quit smoking weed for a few days. That was simple. But do you think I could stop smoking cigarettes during those days? no.</p>
<p>I never smoke pot until late at night (anymore), I don’t like it in the day time as it makes you sleepy afterwards. I don’t experience cravings or withdrawels during the day either, as a real drug addiction would.</p>
<p>The reasons drugs like nicotine are addictive, is because it increases your brains natural “pleasure” chemical, dopamine. Your body adapts to this increased dopamine by reducing the available dopamine receptors. Therefore when you haven’t had a nicotine fix in a while, you have less dopamine then normal. Leaving you feeling like shit. The only way to replenish this dopamine is to get nicotine (or stop nicotine entirely for a few days to a few weeks)</p>
<p>The reason marijuana can be considered addictive, is because it’s fun. Not because of any physical effect on your body or brain. Hence being called “habit-forming”</p>
<p>Basically it boils down to self control. Wake up in the morning and… you have weed, you have nothing important to do, and if you smoke the weed you will feel great and have a better day. It’s hard to say no to this! But again, thats a mind over matter thing. Agreed?</p>
