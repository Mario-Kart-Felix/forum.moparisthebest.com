    <description>I am having trouble designing a program which needs to do the following:

I imput numbers, and the program needs to calculate the mean, maximum, minimum and range. It also needs to be versitile enough to add a calculater, SD, median etc without major reconstruction.

I have been thinking for a while about how to go about doing it, does anybody have any ideas?

I was thinking that the user imputs the statistics, and the program stores them to 5 ariables, minimum, maximum, total, currentimput and samples.

Minimum- Starts at 0, when the user imputs a number it checks it against the current minimum, if the imputed number is less than the minimum, it replaces it. ( If currentimput is greater than minumum then replace)
Maximim- Same as minimum but checking if the number is greater than the current maximum

Total- When the user imputs a number, it adds to the total

samples- When the user imputs a number, it adds 1 to the samples.

Currentimput- Stores the number which was just entered.

Its the best I can come up with, but I don&#39;t know how I would get the mean or SD.</description>
