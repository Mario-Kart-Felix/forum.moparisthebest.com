    <title>My Begginer questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-begginer-questions/288906</link>
    <description>I just started my server yesterday.  And i decided to work on it more today.  But the only problem is i am using a file called &quot;Your Server&quot; Which is based of Deltascape. I Am not sure if you need to know that or not but these questions will help me a bunch ( I know there noob questions but still).

1. People are saying to open stuff like client.class, or client.java and search for something. When i try to it says open with? Pretty much im asking what do i open those files with, notepad?

2. Second is when they say open client.class, or client.java what do they mean search.  Just look for it through all the stuff? (By the way if i get the first question answered i should be able to do this one.)

3. This is the noobish question of them all.  How can i figure out what client im on. 317, 508 or what?  I read through the deltascape source page and didnt see it unless im blind....

And thanks to all who help me!</description>

<li>
<p>client.class can’t be opened really. You would have to decompile first. So you can choose to open client.java with any normal text editor.(like notepad, wordpad, np++.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ctrl+F?</p>

<p>Usually someone posts what it is when they post the source. Not really sure though.</p>
