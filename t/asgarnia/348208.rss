[B]Server Base: iClarity 2.0[/B]
[B]Client Cache Revision: #377[/B]

[IMG]http://i45.tinypic.com/4rvk3c.jpg[/img]


[ul][*]To create a unique and clean private server for everyone&#39;s enjoyment.
[*]To create a content packed version of iClarity using our own methods and classes.
[*]To meet new people through the community we establish, and become closer friends with my co developers.
[*]To create a #459 look-a-like server with the use of GFX, models, anims, minigames, etc.
[*]To fix up all the bugs of iClarity and have a clean server. ([I]we understand glitch-free is non existent[/I])
[*] [B]To learn something, and enjoy myself while I do it.[/B][/ul]

What is Asgarnia originally? 
The [B]Kingdom of Asgarnia[/B] is one of the main kingdoms of the [I]RuneScape[/I]  world.
[spoiler=&quot;more info on Asgarnia origins&quot;]
Asgarnia&#39;s primary economic activities are crafting, mining, and fishing. It also has a notable navy based in Port Sarim. It is ruled over supposedly by the King Vallance and Prince Anlaf; however, they have recently vanished from public life and Sir Amik Varze and Denulth  have taken their place. Some players believe the White Knights are not telling the full truth about themselves. Asgarnia is also the possible home of the Temple Knight&#39;s Headquarters and recruitment centre. Opposed to popular belief, Draynor Village and Edgeville  are NOT located in Asgarnia, but are towns of Misthalin. Many are surprised by this due to the fact that the border between the two regions is so close to these towns.

Most of Asgarnia has a temperate climate. There are exceptions to it. Ice Mountain, for an example, is cold enough to be permanently covered with snow. Also, the southernmost end of Asgarnia with Mudskipper Point has tropical climate. 
[/spoiler]
This server is based off the source &quot;iClarity&quot; which is based from &quot;Whitescape&quot; which has been crash patched.
We call the server &quot;Asgarnia&quot; because the home shall be in Draynor which is a part of the kingdom of Asgarnia, as well will be many other used towns of the map.
Asgarnia is a development by Project Infinity, a group of specially chosen programmers, graphic designers, web developers, and bug finders who love to create RPG games and explore and create source codes to expand their development and programming knowledge.
As listed in the goals, we plan to better the packaging and source code of iClarity, as well as content to the source. At the same time, we will be hosting a server using the base, with plenty of edits so do not worry about seeing us become one of the download and host leeches which I assure you, you will see from others. 
All of our work will be done using proper Java conventions, as well as [I][COLOR=navy]/ Comments to describe the function of the code below*/[/COLOR] [/I]
Our website is very unique, every season the color of the panels will change to correspond with the season color, as well as the main logo will be switched to a different color font and Skillcape every so often to keep a unique style to our site. The main site is integrated with a Database meaning accounts are an option, and server integration may become a reality, depending on what we plan to do with it.

We hope to see you on our server once it is complete, and give us your suggestions along the way of the project to be the best we can possibly be.
[RIGHT]Thanks, Project Infinity Team.[/RIGHT]
