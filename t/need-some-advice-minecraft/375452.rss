    <title>Need some advice (MineCraft)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-advice-minecraft/375452</link>
    <description>Alright, first time on survival mode on my own on Minecraft, I&#39;ve build an in-cave shelter torches, crafting benches etc etc. I actually struck gold before, in my in-cave house I found as I dug deeper and deeper using more and more torches I found more and more coal, I&#39;m on something like 50 coal now for my first night. 

I&#39;ve made a pit fall outside the exit and covered it with dirt and torches.  Now, what should I do? My plan was too extend through the front off it and create a rock house and wall off a route to some critical resources, Lumber etc..

Opinions? The only exit in/out is through the front which is covered with 2 hatch layers of dirt and torches at night.

And on another note, It was morning and I&#39;m next too a dark cave, is it normal to see them all walking back in to it. I got attacked in daylight, luckily he attacked me and then punched my torch outside and set on fire, saved by the torch.  I really want to clear out the cave but I&#39;ve never attacked one of these zombies, I have more than enough torches to light the entire thing up.

Sorry because it&#39;s so long. I know there is some Minecraft players in this community so it would be nice if you could respond.

tl;dr people :

Go away

Iv done alot of things but i don’t play it anymore, it kinda bores me now.</p>
<p>You should make some sticks and then get string from spiders, to make a bow which makes it easier for you to kill skeletons, zombies etc.</p>
<p>Zombies are the easest of them all btw.</p>
