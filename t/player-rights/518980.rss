    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-rights/518980</link>
    <description>Thank you for veiwing this. Please help me.
I want to make it so that when I give player rights 4 to a player (for donator) they can not do the mod admin and owner commands (1,2,and 3 rights).
How can I do this?

Example:
player rights 1
Player Moderator username has logged in.

player rights 2
Administrator username has logged in.

player rights 3
Owner and Coder username has logged in.

player rights 4
[$]Donator username has logged in.

I just dont want the donators being able to do staff commands.
PLEASE HELP!
