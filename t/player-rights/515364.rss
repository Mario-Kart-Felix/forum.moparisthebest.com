    <title>Player Rights</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-rights/515364</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t been on the forums In a while so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s dead but I have decided to start coding RSPS again and I was just messing about with the innovationX old source. For some reason on any account I make its rights = 3 and whenever I try to change the rights it reverts right back to 3. Does anybody understand the cause of this? I would really appreciate it.</description>

              <p>You’re saying you make the rights 3, but then it won’t revert back to 0, or a lower right?</p>
