    <description>I&#39;m pretty sure that this is both client and server sided so I wasn&#39;t quite sure where to put it. Right now the source I downloaded has some very weird icons for admin and mod, it&#39;s a leaf or something. I have the pictures that I want to be the icons in the correct folder but I was wondering which file dealt with the picture that appears next to your name. Also can anyone kind of hint me towards adding an icon next to a player&#39;s name for another feature such as donator. Thanks for all your help =)</description>
