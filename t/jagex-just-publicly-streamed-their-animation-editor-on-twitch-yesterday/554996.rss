              <p>I remember reading some stuff on Glassdoor too about Jagex. One guy came from another country to discuss his pay and they asked him how much he made at his previous job and he answered honestly. At the next stage of the interview they gave him an offer and the amount he would get paid was exactly the same as his old job, converted to brittish pounds. Also &gt;65% of those Glassdoor reports say that their management sucks, but that was something we could derive from the game itself.</p>

<p>I remember someone on an art forum talking about the year or two they spent at Jagex, they said they regret it because their art style isn’t desirable for future employers viewing their portfolio and they also didn’t further their experience with real industry software. They were also really strict on productivity, monitoring everyone’s computer use etc.</p>

<p>Someone contain the sarcasm[/quote]i would like the personally take the time to appreciate you for your feedback on the matter. this is a great topic that we can further discuss at a later time, but for now we must focus on what’s important: progression. this section - and community - is and has been dying for years. just when all hope was lost and we were reaching the end of the slope, z has shown up with this slingshot-esque type posting and has restored faith in the client hacking community. we now know that there is so much going on behind the scenes of this community and that progression can be made</p>
