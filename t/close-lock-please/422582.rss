    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/close-lock-please/422582</link>

              <p>No, i just restarted. My main void for my kernal was corrupted. This was due to my a tual windows 7 that I have something wrong with crashing. Thus nothing saved, much less severe then I thought.<br>
Non the less, I am deciding to restart, on my linux OS i have on this computer. Using that i already have alot of the libs needed.<br>
In other words, restarting not using my faulty windows. The error just came from not everything saving so i tried to emulate the OS to start it to see if it would run at all (Can’t really do anything) but then error, even though it ran. I just was wrong in something, and am restarting it.</p>
