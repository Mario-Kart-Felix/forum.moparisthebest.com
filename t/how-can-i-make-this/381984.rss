    <title>How Can I Make This</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-make-this/381984</link>
    <description>How can i make a game from scratch I mean because I was in geography and uhmm it randomly came to me to make a game that&#39;ll make some cash become very popular and get rid of WoW, RS and all the big names who think their better than us.

So my idea Was a game called FATAL™ thats where I made my user name for this forums and I thought This will be perfect for help on this project. I&#39;ve been looking for a terrain maker for this project so I can atleast start with making the floor. I have made a few weapons with, Meta but they look so crap and unproffesional so I might go into the Model&#39;s section and ask someone good at modelling to help me model some weapons. Well I thought of making something like a crossbreed, Sci-Fi , Medieval, and modern combat. This game will have two sides. One side The natives or Fatality, and the people that crash land on this planet on mistake and do not befriend the native&#39;s which cause a bad side and a good side.

The money will be based on Galactic coins, and the inventory will have 38 slot&#39;s and can carry item&#39;s there will also be a weaponry slot were you can carry your weapons in it for quick weaponry swap. The land will be like in the movie &quot;Avatar&quot; I mean think about it how epic will it be. So i need a how to and maybe some programmes to start me up.


Also I dunno if this belong&#39;s in this section :|</description>

<p>Wrong already, you need a main method before anything starts to run, concidering you’ve been here for a number of years you just failed, badly.</p>
