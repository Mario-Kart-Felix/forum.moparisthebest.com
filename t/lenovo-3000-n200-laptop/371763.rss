    <title>Lenovo 3000 N200 Laptop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lenovo-3000-n200-laptop/371763</link>
    <description>This thing has been sitting in my room since last year. It (was) my dads business laptop, and out of nowhere stopped working. It was at the repair shop for 2 months, then another for a month. Neither solved anything. They even replaced the whole motherboard, thinking it would be a quick fix. Nothing.

-When the power cord is plugged in, the green light on the front shows up
-When the power button is clicked. NOTHING happens. No beeps. No fan starting up. NOTHING.

I&#39;ll post pics and more later... my dad said it had something to do with the power supply, but could 2 repair shops really not fix the damn thing?</description>
