    <description>I regret to inform everyone that my server will be permanently crashed, never again to be rebooted, in 2 days. I will post my reasons below, but I thought I might as well post this, just to let you all know.

Many people have been trying to hack into our computer through the forwarded port, 5555. The trojan, ServeMe, is the one that is try the most and hardest. It attempts roughly every 10-20 seconds. It has thousands of ip-addresses, each attempt has it&#39;s own address, probably ping addresses. It&#39;s destroying our picture on our monitor, makes the computer slow, and takes up huge amounts of space; like 20% worth. If anyone has any info on this problem, help would be appreciated.

In case help doesnt arrive, as my last words,

Bye all, it was great while it lasted.</description>
