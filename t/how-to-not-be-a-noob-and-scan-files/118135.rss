    <description>[b]How to not be a noob and scan files[/b]

Fuck I am bored as shit. Some skateboarders &#39;skated&#39; by an hour ago - so I ran out and punched them in the face for making that sound when you go over the bumps in the sidewalk.

Requirements: OllyDbg
Requirements: Ethereal
Requirements: An operating system that can run OllyDbg and Ethereal

I read sythe forums just for laughs every now and then. Even thought sythe is like a hotspot, I see this shit everywhere.

Here are some scenerios:

Person #1: Download my new autorune version: autorune15.exe
Person #2: It&#39;s safe I just scanned it with norton. You can trust me because I am a global moderator.
Person #3: I click run and nothing happens.
Person #4: plz help me! I dun get get how it da aworks?

Common myth: All antiviruses can detect keyloggers.
Common myth #2: It&#39;s hard to write a keylogger
Common myth #3: It takes more than 4 minutes to write a keylogger.
Common myth #4: It takes more than 10 seconds to ask somebody to make you a keylogger.
Common myth #5: It takes more than 8 seconds to search &quot;keylogger&quot; on pscode.com


Some steps to not be retarted: (These are probably easier to do than antivirus scans)

[1]: Check referenced strings with ollydbg

This step only takes about 10 seconds. If you are unable to do this you (a) have no hands to move the mouse or (b) have no eyes to look at this screen.

Once you open your file in OllyDbg. Right click on the main window -&gt; Search for -&gt; All referenced strings.

You will have a new window pop up.

What we can gather from this data:
(a) The program was written in vb
(b) The program hooks your computer (SetWindowsHookEx)
(c) It retrieves the name of the most active window (GetActiveWindow &amp;&amp; GetForegroundWindow)
(d) It adds/deletes registry keys

What we can gather from this data:
(a) It adds itself to startup
(b) It recieves data from the internet


[2]: If a file is compressed and doesn&#39;t load through OllyDbg?
Why would a file be compressed? Maybe somebody is hiding something?
Why not to compress files:
(a) Because you can still crack it with API hooks in 20 lines of code.
(b) You got nothing to hide.

[3]: Use ethereal to spy on the data it sends and recieves from the server.


This is so fucking easy -like shit-. Oh btw, that was my keylogger from like a year ago. It uses SetWindowsHookEx. I posted the keylogger code in the programming section.</description>
