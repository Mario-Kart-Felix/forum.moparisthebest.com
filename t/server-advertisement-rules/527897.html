        <p>It has come to my attention that Constructive Criticism isn’t allowed when it’s being used in the context of “corrective”</p>
<p>I truly do believe and feel like the staff need to review and discuss the server advertisement rules once more. (if they even did in the first place…surely Flame_ had to get the rules approved by a higher member)</p>
<p>Here are a couple of suggestions if the rules do NOT change:</p>
<p>-Make it so advertisements are “locked” from having replies. If the community can’t express what we are seeing then there is no point whatsoever in posting replies in general. That’s like reading reviews on one of these sites like OfficeMax or BestBuy. Only the “nice” reviews are technically posted(they have to be pre-approved).</p>
<p>-Stricter rules for posting an advertisement. Generally you have a topic where a person will post a bunch of walls of text and say JOIN NOW OMGZ. Yeah…uh… as the old saying goes</p>
<blockquote>no pics no clicks</blockquote>
<p>If an owner is too lazy to make a couple of media images for proof/to show the revision/etc then they honestly have no reason in advertising in the first place.</p>
<p>What is an advertisement?</p>
<blockquote>A notice, such as a poster or a paid announcement in the print, broadcast, or [u][b]electronic media[/b][/u], designed to attract public attention or patronage.</blockquote>
<p>-Finally, I would like to suggest pre-approved topics. I’m sure some of you will be like “omg work load of mods dude!” Yeah uh…no offence to Flame_ but I’m sure he can handle it. I’ve seen his dedication. We may get what one or two REAL new advertisements in a day? Shouldn’t be too hard.</p>
<p>This idea is to help stop spammers in general in the  advertisement section from posting his server more than once. Sure it gets locked eventually but a lot of “server browsers” don’t realize this as they are searching for a server not looking out for the forums. Due to this some servers will have the “unfair advantage”.</p>

        <p>Next time, make it less blatant when you create a thread to passively attack me.</p>
<p>As for your issue, I don’t see a problem with my decisions. What you saw as constructive criticism, I saw as spam. You continued posting about the graphical bugs after the advertiser stated that he liked his server the way it was.</p>
<p>I agree that you should be allowed to point out parts of the server that you would like to see improved, but in all honesty, when someone is advertising their server and states that the change will not be made, I think other members should let it be. To me, it’s more an issue of when to stop posting this so-called constructive criticism. In the end, if you’re not an active player on the server, it won’t affect you. The owner of the server may end up receiving fewer new players because of it, but that only affects him or her.</p>
<p>TL;DR<br>
Constructive criticism becomes spam after a certain point. I’m sure you can agree with me on that.</p>

Not attacking you, attacking the rules. You are doing your job I get that.(even though technically the rules says the other part… )</p>
<p>If you noticed I kept trying to tell the user as well. “You may see it like this, but your players won’t” Server negligence is on the owner/developer(s) not on the community.</p>
<p>Sadly I don’t agree with you. CC is and shall always be a useful tool to a real developer. Any CC no matter if a real player or not should be taken, observed, and worked from. Especially when it comes to something such as a graphical issue. It isn’t that hard to go and replace a silly little graphic in a game. All he had to do was make a topic and we could had assisted him further. Again, negligence on his part is his fault not the community.</p>
<p>If you was a new owner would you tell those and I am going to use your words now “condescending” CC from experienced server owners to fudge off instead of embracing what they are telling you? Of course you wouldn’t.</p>

<p>He stated that he didn’t want to change anything, so why should you pressure him to? If I asked you to change your lifestyle and you didn’t want to, would you seek assistance in doing so? Just because you think something is “wrong”, it doesn’t mean the other person has to change according to what you think.</p>
<p>This will be discussed and a change to the rules will be made if needed.</p>

        <p>Personally, I try to use this layout when posting in a Server Advertisement Thread that I don’t like and wish to offer critique.</p>
<blockquote>I personally don't like the sprite recolors. 
<p>I do like that you acknowledge that you’ve not made very many modifications to the Base. &lt;3 you for being honest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I offer critique and then I try to find something they’ve done right or which suits my personal taste.</p>
<p>On-Topic: I <span class="bbcode-b">do</span> think that there should be some sort of system in place to help filter Server Advertisements. A majority of these Threads are straight up leeched and hosted. Some Threads themselves are even ripped and reposted in an attempt to pass it off as an original creation. It might cut out some site traffic, but would be worth it in my opinion and would better the community. It would also tone down a lot of the flaming and such.</p>

<p>This is a board for suggestions. Not everyone is going to agree with everyone. Just as you stated that you don’t support a few rules. You know what, if you think a rule is incorrect and/or needs changing post about it!</p>

        <p>No to everything you suggested. You don’t know what goes on behind the scenes. It isn’t meant to be fair. If someone doesn’t want to put any effort into their servers, then that sucks for them because they’ll get no players. Pre-approved topics will only increase workload and so will stricter rules. Keep it as it is because it isn’t actually hurting anyone.</p>

[/quote]No, I just think the idea of not letting people download and host as-is is stupid. That’s how I got into RSPS.[/quote]</p>
<p>The thread doesn’t specifically say you can’t download a base as-is and host it. It’s just a thread suggesting that they should put time and effort into their source, and the more important aspects such as stability.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to degrade users who host as-is. I just think that the users who have a general idea of what to do, should try putting time into their project before hosting and or releasing.</p>

        <p>You are jumping to an incorrect conclusion.<br>
First of all, what constructive criticism is will always come down to the discretion of the moderator that is watching the topic and its replies. If someone posts ‘good job, but i don’t like how this source is used time and time again,’ then I can give you my words that I will delete such a reply, as it is not giving any feedback on the server in any way, and it is none of your business on what source the server owner decides to use for their game.<br>
Having posts require approval is too time-consuming and could be better spent doing other more beneficial things to the forum.<br>
As for the ‘no pics no clicks,’ if I see such a reply I will delete it. It is not our place to require an advertiser to include media in any form on their thread. If they wish to spend what seems to you to be 5 minutes on an advertisement thread, then simply skip over it should you not like it.<br>
It is not my place to reject advertisements simply because they do not have any media. Also, it is a lot of work simply because I’m not online 24/7, and other moderators do not spend all of their online time within this section.<br>
If a person decides to post multiple advertisements they will receive a post-ban, basically meaning that they cannot post in that section until I lift the punishment. Also, there are quite a few people that spend time watching out for the section rather than looking for servers to play.</p>
<p>Long story short, if you see something that you feel is breaking any rules, report it. If your reports are not presenting any real reason as to why it should be taken care of, I’ll send you a private message letting you know.</p>

<p>I just ask that the community stays updated on the discussion if there will be any change to this. That is one key issue that at least I hav epersonally seen is that there is no communication between the staff and the community. How are we supposed to know if a suggestion has been declined, still pending, needs more suggestions, is still open, and etc if a staff administrator does not keep us updated. Obviously a lock would indicate either accepted/declined but I am talking about the mid way points.</p>
<p>Anyway it’s a touchy subject in general about advertisements and what should and should not be allowed. I just hope the staff takes all sides into consideration when discussing it.</p>
