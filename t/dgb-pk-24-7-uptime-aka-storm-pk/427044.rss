<p>Mopar i understand your rules but pkufast isnt the admin, hes some new guy that popped up and made the threat most likely to set up rschill.eu so he would get rschill in trouble… think about it man.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Or maybe you say that so RSChill doesn’t get banned?[/quote]</p>
<p>All Im saying is its illogical to assume that ‘PKUFAST’ is ddosing for RSChills admin when I have never seen ‘PKUFAST’ play or do anything else to contribute to the server. If we get taken down from Mopar because some random wants to make threats supporting our server by attacking another its ludacris. Ip0wns stated-<br>
‘I haven’t gived out any ip to others.<br>
Only google ip and some weird botnet ip…<br>
And I think these arent ddos able…<br>
And I don’t recomended anything about to ddos others.’</p>
<p>Problem solved, btw Nemesis I played as Joker on your server, you should know me well enough by now to be loyal to the server I play, Not to DGBPK that spammed RSChill and others because they have a low player base.</p>

<p>(don’t bother taking it down, I saved a backup for proof, and also that picture posted earlier is of this thread)</p>
<p>I’m going to give ‘pkufast’ 24 hours from this post to stop the attack, and if not then I’ll do what I said earlier.</p>
<p>Also, if someone is attacking rschill.eu, then provide me with some proof and I’ll ban/delete/censor them as well.</p>
<p>The end.</p>

<p>That makes no sense… Its like saying lets stop someone from being violent by beating the fuck out of them. It only creates more problems.  It may or may not be dgb ddos’ing you, the only reason you think it is is because people came on the server saying so. That means nothing, I could go on rschill right now and say barney is ddosing you, that does not make it true.</p>
<p>It probably is DGB but I have not seen any solid proof.<br>

<p>Hey guess what, i could care less if it gets taken off mopar or not, The point is, im tired of it, so i handled it my way, and still currently am. Thanks. I usually wouldnt dos, But, its pissing me off, so i could care less if u have proof or not, we do.[/quote]<br>
Oi retard, have you tried loading their forum? It loads instantly so very nice DoS.</p>
