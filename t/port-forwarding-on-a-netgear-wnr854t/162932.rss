    <title>Port Forwarding on a NetGear WNR854T?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding-on-a-netgear-wnr854t/162932</link>
    <description>Before you say go to moparscape, this is NOT for servers.
Anyways, I am running a SSH server at home, behind my NetGear WNR854T router. I did &quot;port forward&quot; [with the router, but maybe I did something wrong?], but it still does not work, whenever I try connecting from any other computer I get no results. I can connect from localhost, however, so the server itself works. I have a RS private server running on another computer there, and it has no problems, so I know its possible. Sorry if this is seems somewhat disconnected from itself, but I am in class at the moment and need help fast. 
Thanks
Justis
PS
Also, if I can&#39;t fix this, if anyone could do me the small favor of letting me run it on their server? :D It&#39;s not going to be used too much, so it won&#39;t eat your stuff up.</description>
