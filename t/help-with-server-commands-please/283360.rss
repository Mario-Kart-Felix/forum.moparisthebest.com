    <title>Help with server commands, please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-server-commands-please/283360</link>
    <description>I have just recently created a 508 server off this site and I wanted to know if anyone could send me a list of commands (item pickup). I have searched in Google but I can&#39;t find how to use them, only how to add them to my server. On my older server which is like a RSC server all i had to type was f.e. ::pickup 1077 0001 (Bandos Tassets) and viola. Now I don&#39;t know what how to use them. My characters rights is set to 2... I think that is right?
And if you could email it to me that would be great, I&#39;m not sure if posting my email address is against the rules, it shouldn&#39;t be.

Sp yeah please help me, any help would be appreciated.
