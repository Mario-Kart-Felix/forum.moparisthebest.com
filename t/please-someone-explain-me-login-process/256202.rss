    <description>I need a server source that only logs in and out so I could study from it.
Or could someone tell me what is the first packet? What does it send?
Okay just my image of that stuff..

server starts
server accepts client
&lt;Does the client send anything else before the unsigned byte below a row?&gt;
client sends a packet &quot;unsigned byte&quot; that is 1 byte long(in c++ it would be a 1 bytes long char)
server uses readunsignedbyte() to read it and this packet returns 14(the login code)

Did I understand it so far?
Well the prob is that every time the first packet has a random byte value.. And I don&#39;t know what to do with it(and how long it is, what declaration or encrytion etc it is using)...</description>
