    <description>Hi I&#39;m 19 I recently came across my old photobucket account which bought back alot of nostalgia and thought i would share some of the photos, i went under the name ffixmaster and i started playing private servers in 2006 and stopped around 2008 so I was around 13, I was an admin on a big server (hemiscape) aka aarscape which was ran by aarisair Who was the person who hosted the old moparscape server status list and was an admin on these forums , I also hosted a server for a little while here are some pictures of my time playing moparscape. Feel free to post some pictures of back in the day

This is the first graphics I made , I know it&#39;s bad but I was only 13 lol

Here&#39;s a picture of the bank I was proud of

I was the first to get max smithing and had the highest total level on the server , there was up to 100 people on at a time which was alot back then, I don&#39;t know how that compares to servers now though 

Along with the friends I Made on the server I also got about 5 friends from school to play who all kept playing for a while which we used to talk and joke about at school , I never took runecape seriously and took private servers even less seriously 

[URL=http://s173.photobucket.com/user/ffixmaster/media/0-4.png.html][IMG]http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w70/ffixmaster/0-4.png[/img][/URL]

I started making graphics for other people on the forums

Through sucking up to mods and admins and befriending some I eventually became a mod, one of the proudest moments of my childhood lol

[URL=http://s173.photobucket.com/user/ffixmaster/media/0000000000000000000000000.png.html][IMG]http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w70/ffixmaster/0000000000000000000000000.png[/img][/URL]

At one stage there was a competition for a new banner for the hemiscape forums here is a couple I made 

[URL=http://s173.photobucket.com/user/ffixmaster/media/00000000000000000000000000000000-1.jpg.html][IMG]http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w70/ffixmaster/00000000000000000000000000000000-1.jpg[/img][/URL]

This one I&#39;m still proud of now haha

[URL=http://s173.photobucket.com/user/ffixmaster/media/hemiscapeofficialborderlol-1.jpg.html][IMG]http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w70/ffixmaster/hemiscapeofficialborderlol-1.jpg[/img][/URL]

This is the banner that won because the other guy ( the wiseguy) was more popular 

[URL=http://s173.photobucket.com/user/ffixmaster/media/47kmni1.jpg.html][IMG]http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w70/ffixmaster/47kmni1.jpg[/img][/URL]

I was friends with him but was pissed off because he just took it from a website that makes them for you and to prove it I posted this on the forums lol 

[URL=http://s173.photobucket.com/user/ffixmaster/media/844657680437911375362ec5f7548fb11.gif.html][IMG]http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w70/ffixmaster/844657680437911375362ec5f7548fb11.gif[/img][/URL]

A random gif I made

[URL=http://s173.photobucket.com/user/ffixmaster/media/0.gif.html][IMG]http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w70/ffixmaster/0.gif[/img][/URL] 

I eventually became an admin from which I remember was because the owner of the server made a massive update and spent ages on it but he changed the whole server and everyone started ranting so he got pissed off and said he was going to close the server so then everyone went crazy some mods and admins went crazy giving away rares and kicking people etc where as I stayed loyal and was shortly after made an admin after 2 weeks of being a mod

[URL=http://s173.photobucket.com/user/ffixmaster/media/agility.png.html][IMG]http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w70/ffixmaster/agility.png[/img][/URL]

I had a fun  time being an admin but all good things come to an end and I got bored and did something I&#39;m not proud of but I still find funny thinking back on it,

I destroyed the server I wanted to go out with a bang  , I went on a rampage banning everyone while the owner wasn&#39;t online I got my friend from school to delete every single post on the forums while I banned everyone and gave away millions of rares to people destroying their value, they tried to save the server by restarting it with everyone on new accounts and new items and new forums but it eventually died after a couple of attempts , remember I&#39;m not proud , 


I then went on to host my own server that went alright
, an advertisement picture I had

[URL=http://s173.photobucket.com/user/ffixmaster/media/mgscapefixed.jpg.html][IMG]http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w70/ffixmaster/mgscapefixed.jpg[/img][/URL]

I can&#39;t really say anything about this...
