    <title>Should I upgrade my RAM?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-i-upgrade-my-ram/14513</link>
    <description>Right now I have 512MB of ram, and a ATI Radeon X300 graphics card.

I can play my games fine, but if I press the windows key insted of CTRL or somthing, all hell breaks loose and my comp lags.

Right now I have 2 256MB ram installed, 2 upgrade slots left open(that&#39;s 4 total), I can afford 1GB of RAM and was wondering, should I upgrade? I&#39;d upgrade my graphics card(I don&#39;t need to but playing games in lowest quality sometimes is annoying, and if you have a good graphics card and low ram with the games graphics on highest, the comp will lag because the graphics card is faster than the ram) but can&#39;t seem to find any ones right for me.

Just wondering on your opinions. :D

Also, can someone explain Page File to me?</description>

              <p>[quote=“Aukake, post:10, topic:14513”]You definately need to upgrade the graphics card if you think you’re going to be doing any sort of gaming other than runescape.  I used to have the same card, I didn’t know how bad I had it. The RAM isn’t sooo bad, but that does seem to be another of your bottlenecks.</p>
<p>And when you say that you can afford 1GB of RAM do you mean adding another 512MB or adding 1GB?</p>
<p>HD size doesn’t really matter. I just burn all my movies (i’m guessing porn takes up a good chunk of your HD) to dvd’s and delete them.[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually, alot of my HD space is taken up by evangelion. I got the seriese and both movies on dvd but their not as good quality as the one on my harddrive.</p>
<p>I like my graphics card, I can play all my games fine(with the exception of Quake 4, single player is slow as hell and multi player because of my broadband), and I can afford to upgrade so I’ve got 1.5GB of ram.</p>
<p>Also, I need to format. There’s no getting away. I installed a program(Peek, lets you see the hex/binary stuff of files, I found it useless. I did find out who made most of RS music though). Anyways, when I right click somthing and choose open with(to open with more files) it opens them with notepad. Also, when I added another user account, scar messed up and now I need to drag the file into the scar window to use it. Somehow though, MS Paint got deleted.</p>
<p>I’ve done everything I’ve can. Done alot of registry editers, defragers and stuff. I’d rather format anyway, all I need to do is make a backup of everything I got onto my mums pc then format then send it back over. The stuff I need is less than 20GB, bit too big for CD’s but sending from my comp on msn to hers is so fast. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, thanks for the comments. I’ll upgrade my ram and save a new graphics card/more ram to later. The comp I’m on can hold 4GB of ram either way. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Omg did someone say they have 40gb hd?! You seriously need an upgrade. I have 300gb =)<br>
Anyways Un-named, when I bought my comp it had 1gb RAM, I suggest you try to upgrade your RAM to 2gb because 1gb isn’t as good as your thinking. With 1gb, if you press crtl+alt+del while playing a cd game, the cd game will freeze/lag. If you don’t want your comp to freeze/lag during a game (which is really irritating) 2gb RAM is right for you.</p>

              <p>Right now I have 512MB of ram, and a ATI Radeon X300 graphics card.</p>
<p>I can play my games fine, but if I press the windows key insted of CTRL or somthing, all hell breaks loose and my comp lags.</p>
<p>Right now I have 2 256MB ram installed, 2 upgrade slots left open(that’s 4 total), I can afford 1GB of RAM and was wondering, should I upgrade? I’d upgrade my graphics card(I don’t need to but playing games in lowest quality sometimes is annoying, and if you have a good graphics card and low ram with the games graphics on highest, the comp will lag because the graphics card is faster than the ram) but can’t seem to find any ones right for me.</p>
<p>Just wondering on your opinions. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Also, can someone explain Page File to me?</p>
