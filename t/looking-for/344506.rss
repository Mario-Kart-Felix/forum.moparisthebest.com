    <title>Looking for</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for/344506</link>
    <description>I have been on the search for a really good server download for my site. 

I am looking for a source that is 459 and under. With perfect working skills, all of which require levels and make the equipment that is needed (Rune bar makes rune dagger). Also, it would have to be a server with monsters in good locations, and not just 500 monsters lined up in rows in an open grass field. I am looking for a server that is different from the regular server.

If anyone could help me find one, I&#39;d be most appreciative. I have been looking for other, and it would be great to have some help. :)

Thanks, Moooooooo16.</description>
