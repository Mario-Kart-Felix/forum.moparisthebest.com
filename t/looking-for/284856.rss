    <title>Looking For</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for/284856</link>
    <description>ok so im pretty new to java coding, ive done simple tuts and practiced on a few sources with some simple things... but i dont feel that im getting anywhere.... so i would love to find a guide, a guide that concentrates on making 317 servers, that explains EVERYTHING in detail, from beginner stuff to expert stuff, i have a few friends that have showed me bits and bobs but i dont feel its enough, i wana learn what files contain what, and what strings and arrays are etc.... any suggestions would be appreciated guys.

thanks to you all &lt;3</description>

              <p>well honestly just look for java coding c++ tutorials and explore, thats the only way u can learn is by doing it and geting used to it. fixing your mistakes will also help u learn.</p>
<p>a class is just something that does something ex. class 118 in my files is used to make slayer dood talk or class 2450 could be a item or a portal. etc.</p>
<p>whats in your files is what makes the game run  ^.^</p>
