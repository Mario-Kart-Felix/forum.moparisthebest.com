    <description>Mmkay well seriously I don&#39;t know whats wrong this lol...firstly the problem is I can&#39;t deposit items into my bank unless I click deposit all.

I have looked at bank.java and it seems like everything is fine..

I even ripped the codes of bank.java from other sorces and just nothing happens..

It could be the buttonhandler but idk..did anyone have to fix this or know the problem?

-Thanks</description>
