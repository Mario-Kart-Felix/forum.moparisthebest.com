    <title>Looking for two software engineers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-two-software-engineers/527751</link>
    <description>Good afternoon Moparscape,

We are looking for up to two software engineers to join our development team, primarily a front-end web developer or a Java programmer (RSPS).

These are the roles we are ideally looking for, but can be flexible if you have skills in another area. This will be a closed-source project and we cannot release specific details as this is such a fast-paced and highly competitive market, but you will be responsible for taking a crucial role in the execution of a full software lifecycle, producing a stable and enjoyable Runescape private server alongside some of the worlds most talented software engineers.

[b]Web developer:[/b] Preferably someone with front-end skills in Javascript and CSS, or possibly even design skills (i.e., Photoshop). A backend developer should ideally have Rails experience or at least a strong willingness to learn.

[b]Java developer:[/b] We&#39;re not looking for years of experience - just somebody who knows the language well and isn&#39;t just hacking things in from tutorials. You could either work on the client or server side.

You can contact the team by dropping me an email directly ([email]matty.j.thompson@gmail.com[/email]), or just by posting here. We&#39;d just like a short summary of..

[ul][li]As little or as much about you as you like (age, studies, etc..)[/li]
	[li]Free time (how much, when, and your timezone)[/li]
	[li]Your skills (programming languages, frameworks, other experience)[/li]
	[li]Why you think you&#39;d be interested in this project[/li][/ul]

We can then have a few discussions to see if you&#39;d be suitable for this project. We&#39;re not looking for experts, but need someone reliable who can check in regularly and be willing to work with others. We are flexible in terms of communication (IRC, IM, Skype, Email) and will be using version control to manage code.</description>
