    <description>[center][b][size=18pt]317Serv Development Team![/size][/b]
The road to a better server!
[/center]

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;newty&gt; Krane, go ahead and post it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So don&#39;t lock this mods!

Well, I think it&#39;s time we made one good server considering all the crappy ones out there, except Speljohan&#39;s &lt;3.
But Speljohan&#39;s isn&#39;t a group project, it&#39;s a server he is personally writing for profit :p.

So I have come up with the idea of making a development team to further advance Yz85Racer&#39;s 317Serv.
If you would like to join the project the format is as follows.
[code]
Preferred alias: 
Programming experience:
An example of what you have done:
A way other team members can contact you(Preferably MSN or IRC).
[/code]

[b][size=14pt]The Team: [/size][/b]

[ul][li]Krane[/li][/ul]


[b][size=14pt]Features: [/size][/b]

[ul][li]All of 317Serv&#39;s current features.[/li]
[li]Asynchronous database querying.[/li]
[li]Asynchronous event management.[/li][/ul]


[b][size=14pt]Pictures: [/size][/b]
I will post pictures as soon as there is something to post pictures for...



Well, I hope I get some people to help on the project, and I hope we can get somewhere with this.</description>

              <p>=Wow, I think I’ve had a change of mind, I’ve been looking at 317Serv and it’s really slow and buggy.<br>
And Graham’s server has a lot of stuff I don’t really need, like the JS5 update server, etc.</p>

              <p>^ Do you say this because other people favor Graham then Speljohan? RS2D is a very stable framework, very great. Graham’s is also good but Graham’s isn’t good for beginner programmers. I’m not saying Krane is a beginner program, but let him test other frameworks which he could possibly improve.</p>

              <p>Use MINA &lt;3 as your library btw you should see Grahams framework. I’m pretty sure it will eat up Speljohans framework since they use RS2D by Varek as their base from what I’ve seen… And I wouldn’t say YZ85Racer’s 317Server isn’t anything special… You should really take a look at grahams you will be surprised.</p>
