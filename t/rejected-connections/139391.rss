    <title>Rejected connections =\</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rejected-connections/139391</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m about to release Dimmu so people can play, and I&#39;m using Silab&#39;s client for now (MAJOR RESPECT SILAB!), but to the point..

Whenever I log in, it fully accepts my connection, I log out, it&#39;ll reject my connection, then accept it, but won&#39;t log me in. I realize this probably is easy to fix, I was told it might be a problem in my player.java or my server.java, but the guy wasn&#39;t sure. If you could post how to fix that, I&#39;d be greatful. An example of what it looks like:
[code]
Game saved for player fr33b1e
ClientHandler: Client fr33b1e disconnected.
ClientHandler: Rejected CRAFTY-NUMBERS:NUMBERS
Connection accepted from CRAFTY-NUMBERS: NUMBERS.[/code]

Thanks for your help in advance!</description>
