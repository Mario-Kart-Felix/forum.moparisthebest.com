    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-a-bat-yell-command/258793</link>
    <description>Hey, i was just wondering if i could make it so that on the run.bat, if i type in a word into the run.bat, e.g. &quot;Hey server&quot;, it would come up in the chat screen saying:
[SERVER] - Hey server

Can someone do that?</description>
