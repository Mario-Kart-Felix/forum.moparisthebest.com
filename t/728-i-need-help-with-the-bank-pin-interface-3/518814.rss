    <title>[728] i need help with the bank pin interface :3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/728-i-need-help-with-the-bank-pin-interface-3/518814</link>
    <description>The base I am using is &quot;ZenithScape&quot;, I have a feeling that some people are going to say something along the lines of &quot;That base sucks, it has issues&quot;, I&#39;m well aware of this but when I start a project I try to finish it. :)

I&#39;ve managed to get the window to show but the buttons are missing, any help would be greatly appreciated, my code is:

		player.closeInterfaces();
		player.getInterfaceManager().sendInterface(13);
		player.getPackets().sendIComponentText(13, 25, &quot;Exit&quot;);
		player.getPackets().sendIComponentText(13, 26, &quot;Please enter a FOUR DIGIT PIN using the buttons below.&quot;);
		player.getPackets().sendIComponentText(13, 27, &quot;Bank PIN&quot;);
		player.getPackets().sendIComponentText(13, 28, &quot;First click the FIRST digit.&quot;);

Yes, I did attempt to search the forums first, I did not come up with anything for 728. Sorry If I somehow managed to miss it.

EDIT:

I forgot to mention, I haven&#39;t done anything private server related since 2007 nor have I done interfaces, this is my first attempt, If I can get the buttons to show I&#39;m fairly sure I could figure out the rest.

EDIT:

I&#39;m really not sure about this, no one seems to want to help on this website and I&#39;m just confused, am I doing something wrong? Am I not using the proper interface? Or is it an issue with the interface itself on the client? Someone please help me.</description>
