    <description>Hi, i know how to make it so that admins cant trade, attack or duel people but how can i make it so that other players cant do it to them? this is the code

[code]if (playerRights &lt; 2) {
        outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
        outStream.writeByteC(4); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
        outStream.writeByteA(1); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
        outStream.writeString(&quot;Trade with&quot;);
        outStream.endFrameVarSize();
}[/code]
