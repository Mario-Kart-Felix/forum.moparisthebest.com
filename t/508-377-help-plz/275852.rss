    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-377-help-plz/275852</link>
    <description>Whenever i download a source or client for a 508 or 377 sometimes it has run but most of time it doesnt. If it has it doesnt work. Ive been told to copy a run from a diff server into one to give it a run... it then shows up for less than a second and disappears. Ive been told to get a better version of java also. I have jdk 6.12 so which of these ways works and what am i doing wrong? I dont use 508s much so plz help</description>
