    <description>Soo I&#39;m trying to make it where whenever people get my client, it downloads the NEW cache not the OLD cache, so I changed the download links, deleted the old cache out of my C: thing, I changed the version, but whenever it finished, it said error connecting to server? What am I supposed to do, my teamviewer is open if anyone wants to get on it.</description>
