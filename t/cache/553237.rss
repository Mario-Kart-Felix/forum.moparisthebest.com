<p>No need for the Team-viewer and Skype. If you post the problem on here you will get the help from the whole community not just one person to work with you. Post pictures of your errors and we will see what we can do.</p>
<p>It also helps to have all of your problems posted on here so if any other members run into the same error they can just go to this thread and see the fixes that are left in the reply section.</p>
