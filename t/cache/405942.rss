    <title>Cache</title>

    <description>Ok well I just recently got a cache hosting site so i changed the download link in CacheDownloader.java and Client.java so i compiled no errors.. but when i try to run the client it downloads the cache but it gets stuck on &quot;Unpacking..&quot;. How can I fix this?

Also I made a run.jar instead of .bat and I was going to try and make it so all the players needed to download was that but when it downloads the cache, it downloads it to the desktop, how can i change this so it downloads it to the C drive? 
[code=actionscript]public static String sencondDir() {
		File file = new File(&quot;C:/Cache/&quot;);
		if (!file.exists())
			file.mkdir();
		return file.toString();
	}[/code]
That is in signlink.java, so i thought it should download it to the c drive? PLEASE HELP!</description>
