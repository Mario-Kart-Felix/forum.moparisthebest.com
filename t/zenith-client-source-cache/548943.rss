PICS
GE From ad thread!


Jadinko from ad thread!


Polypore from ad thread!


QBD from ad thread, i made it before the xteas were released.


Custom vote point store that goes off of points rather than tokens so it doesnt take up space. Dung works the same way.



Armour slots correctly fitted none of this wierd stuff :P


One of the many pets, vulture!



Dung shop, works with internall points rather than tokens. i just used the dung gold as a item to be displayed in box.


The command central to show commands to players


Where the custom kiln is.


Use your firecape on the floating orb to initiate har arken.


HarArken, tentacles will spawn at random around you and start attackign you.


Summoning interface lites up when your pouch can be made.


Pouch gets made when you click it.


Custom farming where it has timers and stuff, i started on playeronly world objects for it but never finished.


Then after picking the allotment or herb you get a random amount of that item 1-3 and exp


The new cache, shark fists and olympic clothing.[/spoiler]</description>
