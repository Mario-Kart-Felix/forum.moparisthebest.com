I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s an awesome movie from multiple people. Director is Quentin Tarantino with the cast of Samuel L. Jackson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx and others.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Set in the South two years before the Civil War, Django is a slave whose brutal history with his former owners lands him face-to-face with German-born bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Schultz is on the trail of the murderous Brittle brothers, and only Django can lead him to his bounty. The unorthodox Schultz acquires Django with a promise to free him upon the capture of the Brittles - dead or alive. Success leads Schultz to free Django, though the two men choose not to go their separate ways. Instead, Schultz seeks out the South&#39;s most wanted criminals with Django by his side. Honing vital hunting skills, Django remains focused on one goal: finding and rescuing Broomhilda, the wife he lost to the slave trade long ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>It was a pretty good movie. I really enjoyed it. A lot of “niggers” in it. It’s got funny parts in it as well.</p>
<p>When I went to watch it, I said “I’m here to watch a black guy fuck shit up”. Guy knew exactly what I was talking about, and he said “He certainly does”.</p>

              <p>Have heard the same as well. In all fairness, I’ll probably enjoy it as Tarantino is my second favorite director behind Scorsese and DiCaprio always does a great job in movies(though in all fairness, The Great Gatsby was suppose to come out on Christmas as well which I’m bummed about being pushed back).</p>
