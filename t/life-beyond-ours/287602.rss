    <title>Life beyond ours?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/life-beyond-ours/287602</link>
    <description>There are planets besides ours, stars besides ours, galaxies besides ours, but is there life besides ours?  I&#39;m not talking little insects that crawl around, or plant-like things that grow up then die without moving more than a foot.  I&#39;m talking intelligent, communicating species out there other than humans.  I mean, not every civilization flourishes off of oxygen.  Another galaxy could live off of an abundant source of an element that would be poisonous and instant death to a human.  It&#39;s unpredicatable.  I&#39;m just curious about other peoples&#39; opinions.  I mean, we&#39;ve had civilizations that have died out and then we&#39;re still here.  How did the Native Indians get in America?  Did the evolve, just as the Spanish did across seas?  Sure, put a history book in my face.  I&#39;ll put a science book in yours.  Our knowledge of our past is based mainly off of guestimations.  So what&#39;s your guestimation?  I guestimate that there are species even on the stars we see that are 100x smarter, more intelligent, more developed, and happier than we are.</description>

<p>I mix my meanings.  My actual thoughts are that our guestimations are that of distances, such as lightyears etc.  Like exactly how far away a star is based on how it moves.  Crazy stuff.</p>

<p>It’s quite simple to make a crop circle. As jme said, draw it out first and then use ropes. Like the name suggests, they are circular. Find a suitable point and make it the center, then use ropes to measure the distance to a second, third, etc circle’s center.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CropCircleSwirl.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CropCircleSwirl.jpg</a></p>
<p>First you see 3 center circles. They form a triangle when you connect the centers. In the middle is a big circle, which is the biggest of all the swirls. To find the center of the second circle after the biggest, just add the half of the diameter of circle 1 and 2. Using a compass you’ll find the exact location of the next circle.</p>

Why would they visit us? If they have the technology to travel through space then I doubt they’d visit a planet with dumbasses thousands of years behind them.</p>
<p>Unless they plan to colonise… 'though there is plenty of more planets out there.<br>

<p>Natural resources and slaves. If I was the leader of a planet I’d send ships to every planet that isn’t as advanced as mine, and I’d plunder it of all its resources and enslave it’s population.</p>
<p>It’s the colonial ages all over again.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s a human perspective. There could be life forms out there made up of gas, transmitting information by passing and merging with each other. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>I highly doubt there is anything like a human out there, because the odds of a planet having the exact same conditions and evolutionary path as us is so unlikely it could seem impossible. Not to mention the coincidence of them being around at the same time as our race. Therefore I doubt there are other lifeforms out there with the intentions of colonizing or profiting from space.</p>
<p>And has anyone considered that humans may be the most advanced race in the universe right now? If this was true then it could take 1000s before any lifeforms meet each other. One thing is for sure, they will meet each other, but whose to say it will be us (The human race)meeting someone; we could all be dead by then. And whose to say there aren’t lifeforms on planet out there right now who are meeting each other and discovering other lifeforms.</p>
<p>Earth could be an anomaly on this side of the universe, meaning we will never meet another lifeform outside of Earth (unless of course we go to a whole different segment of the universe). The other side could be completely connecting, where life is a common appearance.</p>
<p>Basically, we just don’t know, but it’s fun to think about.</p>
