    <description>[Please don&#39;t delete this topic it is very helpful for those setting up a server with 2modem]

Description: Getting a 2wire modem to portforward, host correctly and setting up no-ip .

Difficulty: 1-2

Assumed Knowledge: Reading, looking at pictures, cmd &gt; ipconfig

Well I&#39;m making this tutorial because it seems a lot of people don&#39;t know how to correctly host and portforward with a 2wire modem.

Step One: Connecting to your modem

The very first thing we need to do is figure out how to connect to the 2wire modem. Go to the address bar and type home. If this is too difficult, then look at this picture I provided:
[img]http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/1450/194066656854338770.jpg[/img]
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Now you should come to a screen that looks like this:
[img]http://img257.imageshack.us/img257/2086/194066656912606041.jpg[/img]

_____________________________________________________________________________________
If that doesn&#39;t work, then we need to make it more easier:

First, open up the start menu on your computer, and click run. (Some computers don&#39;t have this feature, if yours doesn&#39;t, click search, or use the computer search bar. In whichever option you picked, type cmd.

After doing that, you should either see a program file called cmd, or a program pop up called Command Prompt. If it was the first one, just click on the cmd program. Now after opening up the Command Prompt, type ipconfig.
[img]http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3162/194066657511743431.jpg[/img]
Now you need to look for the default gateway.

 _________________________________________________________________________

Whatever that is, type that into the address bar. That will bring you to this screen:
[img]http://img842.imageshack.us/img842/2086/194066656912606041.jpg[/img]
_____________________________________________________________________
Step Two: Firewall Settings - Opening ports

From there, click Firewall, then Firewall Settings. The System will now prompt you for a password. If you or someone else changed your password, you may need to call you ISP&#39;s tech support, and ask them to change your password. Once entering that, you should come to a screen that looks like this:[img]http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/3459/194066658264783436.jpg[/img]
Circled in the red is the option you need to change according to the computer you want to host from.  Circled in the black is what we need to click after we edit the first option. So click &quot;Add a new user-defined application&quot;.

________________________________________________________________________________
From there, edit the options so they are exactly as I show them here:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/MZRHE.jpg[/img]

________________________________________________________________________________
Then, we&#39;re going to add port 25 in that same application (I have no idea but it works for me), so just copy the settings I have in this picture:
[img]http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/2903/194066658862363691.jpg[/img]

__________________________________________________________________________________
Then click Add Definition, then click Back.

ALMOST DONE - Now all you need to do is switch the computer to the one you&#39;re hosting from (which I already showed you), then click on the Application you just made (RSPS), and click Add. Then... YOU&#39;RE DONE. So it should look like this:[img]http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/9977/194067276057899651.gif[/img]


____________________________________________________________________________________

STEP 3: Setting up no-ip

If its your first time you will need to register a no-ip account here [url=http://www.no-ip.com/newUser.php]http://www.no-ip.com/newUser.php[/url]
once that&#39;s done login and go to add a host.  If this is too difficult, then look at this picture I provided: [img]http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/5103/194067277030531809.jpg[/img] 

____________________________________________________________________________________
Then you should get this:
[img]http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4548/194067277522356873.jpg[/img]
Type a server name you want, make sure its .biz,.org, and .info. Then click create host

____________________________________________________________________________________
Now you need to download the newest version of the No-IP Dynamic Update Client (DUC) here:[url=https://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php]https://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php[/url] click on one of these windows,mac,and linux/BSD/Unix depending on what computer you have and download it. If this is too difficult, then look at this picture I provided:
[img]http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/3919/194067277992060000.jpg[/img]

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Next find Duc30 or Duc on your computer by looking in your downloads folder under my documents or using the computer search bar or scrolling through all your programs on your computers start button.  Whatever you choose click on Duc30 or Duc to install and run it. Then it should give you a login screen that looks like this:
[img]http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/2365/194067278241598009.jpg[/img]
where it says e-mail address and password use the email and password that you created your no-ip account with to login.

_______________________________________________________________________________________
Now you should get something like this:
[img]http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/2204/194067278553882584.jpg[/img]
The box to your left of your serverip, make sure you click in it to make a check mark to make it online then click on save. Now run your server

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
SETUP 4: SEEING IF ITS ONLINE

To check if your server is online go here as the picture is posted:
[img]http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6743/194067278982055271.jpg[/img] NOTE:  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE  THE SERVER RUN.BAT TURNED ON BEFORE YOU DO THIS
After you click server status check where it says ip type your serverip you just made leave the port to 43594 and click on check if it says its online that means it worked.

This is my second tut, my other tut is hamachi view here [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,519980.msg3775688.html#msg3775688]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,519980.msg3775688.html#msg3775688[/url] if you plan to go that way on hosting. I hoped it help. If you need any help please post comments below or private message me</description>

<p>Description: Getting a 2wire modem to portforward, host correctly and setting up no-ip .</p>
<p>Difficulty: 1-2</p>
<p>Assumed Knowledge: Reading, looking at pictures, cmd &gt; ipconfig</p>
<p>Well I’m making this tutorial because it seems a lot of people don’t know how to correctly host and portforward with a 2wire modem.</p>
<p>Step One: Connecting to your modem</p>
<p>The very first thing we need to do is figure out how to connect to the 2wire modem. Go to the address bar and type home. If this is too difficult, then look at this picture I provided:<br>
<img src="http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/1450/194066656854338770.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<hr>
<p>Now you should come to a screen that looks like this:<br>
<img src="http://img257.imageshack.us/img257/2086/194066656912606041.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<hr>
<p>If that doesn’t work, then we need to make it more easier:</p>
<p>First, open up the start menu on your computer, and click run. (Some computers don’t have this feature, if yours doesn’t, click search, or use the computer search bar. In whichever option you picked, type cmd.</p>
<p>After doing that, you should either see a program file called cmd, or a program pop up called Command Prompt. If it was the first one, just click on the cmd program. Now after opening up the Command Prompt, type ipconfig.<br>
<img src="http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3162/194066657511743431.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
Now you need to look for the default gateway.</p>
<hr>
<p>Whatever that is, type that into the address bar. That will bring you to this screen:<br>
<img src="http://img842.imageshack.us/img842/2086/194066656912606041.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<hr>
<p>Step Two: Firewall Settings - Opening ports</p>
<p>From there, click Firewall, then Firewall Settings. The System will now prompt you for a password. If you or someone else changed your password, you may need to call you ISP’s tech support, and ask them to change your password. Once entering that, you should come to a screen that looks like this:<img src="http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/3459/194066658264783436.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
Circled in the red is the option you need to change according to the computer you want to host from.  Circled in the black is what we need to click after we edit the first option. So click “Add a new user-defined application”.</p>
<hr>
<p>From there, edit the options so they are exactly as I show them here:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i.imgur.com/MZRHE.jpg" title="MZRHE.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MZRHE.jpg" alt width="547" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">MZRHE.jpg</span><span class="informations">810×740</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<hr>
<p>Then, we’re going to add port 25 in that same application (I have no idea but it works for me), so just copy the settings I have in this picture:<br>
<img src="http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/2903/194066658862363691.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<hr>
<p>Then click Add Definition, then click Back.</p>
<p>ALMOST DONE - Now all you need to do is switch the computer to the one you’re hosting from (which I already showed you), then click on the Application you just made (RSPS), and click Add. Then… YOU’RE DONE. So it should look like this:<img src="http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/9977/194067276057899651.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP 3: Setting up no-ip</p>
<p>If its your first time you will need to register a no-ip account here <a href="http://www.no-ip.com/newUser.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.no-ip.com/newUser.php</a><br>
once that’s done login and go to add a host.  If this is too difficult, then look at this picture I provided: <img src="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/5103/194067277030531809.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<hr>
<p>Then you should get this:<br>
<img src="http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4548/194067277522356873.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
Type a server name you want, make sure its .biz,.org, and .info. Then click create host</p>
<hr>
<p>Now you need to download the newest version of the No-IP Dynamic Update Client (DUC) here:<a href="https://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php</a> click on one of these windows,mac,and linux/BSD/Unix depending on what computer you have and download it. If this is too difficult, then look at this picture I provided:<br>
<img src="http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/3919/194067277992060000.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<hr>
<p>Next find Duc30 or Duc on your computer by looking in your downloads folder under my documents or using the computer search bar or scrolling through all your programs on your computers start button.  Whatever you choose click on Duc30 or Duc to install and run it. Then it should give you a login screen that looks like this:<br>
<img src="http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/2365/194067278241598009.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
where it says e-mail address and password use the email and password that you created your no-ip account with to login.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now you should get something like this:<br>
<img src="http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/2204/194067278553882584.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
The box to your left of your serverip, make sure you click in it to make a check mark to make it online then click on save. Now run your server</p>
<hr>
<p>SETUP 4: SEEING IF ITS ONLINE</p>
<p>To check if your server is online go here as the picture is posted:<br>
<img src="http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6743/194067278982055271.jpg" alt width="" height=""> NOTE:  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE  THE SERVER RUN.BAT TURNED ON BEFORE YOU DO THIS<br>
After you click server status check where it says ip type your serverip you just made leave the port to 43594 and click on check if it says its online that means it worked.</p>
<p>This is my second tut, my other tut is hamachi view here <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,519980.msg3775688.html#msg3775688" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,519980.msg3775688.html#msg3775688</a> if you plan to go that way on hosting. I hoped it help. If you need any help please post comments below or private message me</p>
