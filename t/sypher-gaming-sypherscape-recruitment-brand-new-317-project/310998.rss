    <description>[center][size=36pt]PROJECT SYPHERSCAPE[/size][/center]

Ok, im BACK! And this time I plan to revolutionize the 317 industry, this time with some teamates though.

So pretty much gonna start a whole new project. It will be a runescape server that is not exactly like runescape was, but will have the same economy. Leveling will not be too fast but not too slow either, you will have to work hard for your money and random skill levels. Plan for ALL skills to work, replace some interfaces(Such as crappy Quest one), Perfect PvP, Perfect PvE, Perfect All Skills and pretty much just make everything work.

I have not completed thinking about what is going to happen, how it is or how long it will take. I just want to get it done! Though this is an early post so I want to get some teamates and actually decide as a group whats happening, how and when. I have just bought a website domain for 2 years and currently will be hosting it for free (www.000webhost.com), until we get donations although we probably wont need to upgrade web hosting for a while. To start off if someone else could host the server 24/7 (As we are unable to get proper broadband where we live&lt;---BULLSHIT) and we are stuck with 3g/3.5g internet. But yeah ill leave the rest to be decided as a group, if you want in(I wont blame you if you do) use this form to apply in a reply to this post:
