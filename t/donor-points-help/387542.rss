    <title>Donor Points! HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/donor-points-help/387542</link>
    <description>hey everyone,

i&#39;d like to know hiw could i code a [b]  &quot;donor points system&quot; [/b].

For those which ones dont know what i mean by &quot;donor points system&quot;, well its simple.. For all prople which ones will donate, well they&#39;d recieve a amount of &quot;donor points&quot; due the amount they donated..

For example: 
if someone donate 10$, i could give him 20 donor points (i would give him by typing a command like (::give10DonorsTo USERNAME) and this person could buy items (from donor shop) with donor points)

***so bassically, i want a code with which one I could put Donor shop and Donors would be able to buy these items from this Donor shop with Donor Points..

Thanks,
DZ3KO.</description>
