<p><a class="mention" href="/u/co">@co</a> pked - Dont listen to Kuchiki, this is a client and server sided thing. The server only says what the person can do with a certain playerrights.

<p>Hm. How do you know if he meant crown by “sing”…I was stating he’d get more help in the server help section and if he typed correctly.<br>

Crown is my term for the “crown” that staff gets, he uses sign for that. Its a small typo and an easy understanding for me.[/quote]</p>
<p>Did I say it wasn’t understandable? It’s just quite anoyifg w3n pp1 t4lk l1k3 dis al da teim.</p>
<p>Anywho, there are tuts on adding new crowns for new playerrights. You can just use any playerright for donator, as well. 100…4…12…Doesn’t really matter, as long as your commands do not have…"&amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 1" because then it will count for donators too.</p>
