              <p>Are you having issues opening the shop? And these are the steps:</p>
<p>Make a shop in shops.cfg</p>
<p>Go to the java file where the npc interactions are located</p>
<p>There should be an entire section in that dedicated to shops (is a switch statement and has the case being the npc id and the return value the shop id)</p>
<p>once youâ€™ve done that, compile and it should work A ok</p>
