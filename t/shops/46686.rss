              <p>Ummm why does shops never work for me?! I did this in Pimpscape (like it said) and it doesn’t work. I have tried multiple NPC’s. Please Help me. It wither doesn’t work or it disconnects me. I have tried actual shopkeepers (Bandit Shopkeeper) and not actual shopkeepers (evil dave). Please help!</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Purpose:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">To teach members how to add shops.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Difficulty:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Assumed Knowledge:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Basic Java coding knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Server Base:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">PimpScape</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Classes Modified:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Client.Java, Shops.Cfg</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Procedure</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Step 1:</span> [i]Firstly, open up your shops.cfg. Then, search for: <code>[ENDOFSHOPLIST]</code>. Now, type in the following coder right on top of it: <code>shop = #	NAME							2	2	ID	QUAN. ID	QUAN.</code>. Make sure they this code is aligned with all the other code in there. Change <span class="bbcode-b">#</span> to the shop number. Use the number after the last ID you have in your shops.cfg. For example, look at the ID of the shop above <code>[ENDOFSHOPLIST]</code> before you added anything. Make your shop number greater than that number. Change <span class="bbcode-b">NAME</span> to the name of the shop you want to add. Change <span class="bbcode-b">ID</span> to the item ID you want sold here. Change <span class="bbcode-b">QUAN.</span> to the amount sold. You can keep adding item ID’s and quantities until you want to stop. Good job, building your shop is done. Now we have to get a NPC to “link” to it.</p>
<h2>
<span class="bbcode-b">Step 2:</span> [i]Open up your client.java. Now, search for: <code>else if (NPCID == 1305) 
{
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = 30;
}
</code>. Right on top of it, add the following code: <code>
else if (NPCID == ID)
{ 
	PutNPCCoords = true;
	WanneShop = SHOPNUMBER;
}
</code>. Change <span class="bbcode-b">ID</span> to the ID of the NPC you want to “link” to the shop. Change <span class="bbcode-b">SHOPNUMBER</span> to the number that you put for your shop in your shops.cfg just one step ago.</h2>
<p>You have now added shop(s)! Good job! Post any problems/questions/concerns.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Credits:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">100% to nets8</span></p>
