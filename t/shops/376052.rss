    <description>There is no shops.java or shophandler.java or anything related to shops on my source... i like my source to everything except this but is there a way i can fix this
its codeusa z508/525 cache...

is it possible that i could just take the shops.java and others and place them into my source (i know that would be leeching, but i would give propper credits, i aint like that)</description>
