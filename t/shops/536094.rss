    <description>What would be ideal shops for a server? What NPCs would fit the spot? Should shops be all in one location? And if-so, should the shopkeepers of the shops be arranged in a line, or scattered in that area?

This is a discussion about shops. What should shops be? What should shops have? Discuss!

If you have enough time, tell us items for the shops. Server owners would love to put your ideas into action automatically instead of seeing what items to add to the shop. ;)</description>

              <p>Why don’t you get rid of all the shops and have the server player base item trading.  Runescape does a great job of doing and that’s why the ge works great.  the only prob with this is how would you know how much something is if your going to use gp?</p>

<p>Well, make it work properly as an exchange with fixed prices, and you’ll be fine.[/quote]<br>
I’m talking about actual Runescape when it put the grand exchange was put in <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>It basically worked like this<br>
Merchanting clan has spambots advertise their clan "Make mils in minutes"<br>
Players join it, and buy whatever item the clan leader (and his friends) tells them in bulk<br>
Supply goes down, demand goes up, therefore the price rises<br>
At a peak, where the demand starts to go stead as people catch on the price rise, the leaders flood the market with the item, making their huge profit, and then tell the merchanting clan to sell.</p>
<p>The issue is that the leaders have massive amounts to spend (cash stacks upon cash stacks), and by the time the normal players get word, the prices have started to fall.  Supply not only meets demand, but creates a surplus, making it impossible to sell for roughly 80% of the clan.</p>
<p>They promised a low risk, high return investment (an impossibility) in order to profit themselves.<br>
Basically, they fucked over the economy to get more money themselves.</p>
<p>If you think comparing the grand exchange to the stock market is extreme, just look at how similar the grand exchange webpage from 2009 (or so) looked when compared with the Yahoo! Finances page from the same time.</p>
<p>Of course, servers are vastly smaller in comparison, and typically more regulated, though this doesn’t rule out the possibility of abuse.</p>

              <p>Your discussion isn’t accurate. It depends on what the server is like. If it’s a pk server, then everything should be cheap and in one area. If it’s an economy server, then the other way around. It also depends on how the economy server is handled. Shops need to suit the server accordingly.</p>

              <p>I’d recon to make is as economical as possible. Just put the simple necessities in the shops, such as up to like mirthril arrows in a range shop for example. Nothing to crazy in shops like rune. It make the game more fun to work towards, so that people will spend more time in-game. That and make sure the NPC drops are somewhat complete. And for the sake of god, don’t put the shops in a line. It’s horribly ugly. I’d prefer having shops in different building in a city, such as varrock or falador.</p>
