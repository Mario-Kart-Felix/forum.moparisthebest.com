    <description>Ok i have a shop in the middle of varrock that is selling rares, and everything works great, but there just 1 slight problem...
If i change the NPC to an NPC without the option of Trade, i cant trade them, is there a way to make it so if i talk to them they trade me, because thats how it is on PimpScape, oh well everything works great and everything, i just wish i could make party pete the shop keeper for the rares shop ;D

If someone could please post how to fix this, i would greatly appriciate it ;D

THANKS!!! ;D</description>
