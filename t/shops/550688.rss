    <description>Hey,

I know this seems simple and usually I would have fixed it by now as I&#39;ve gone into it. Unless I am missing the point and it is really much more simple, but I don&#39;t know. 

I am trying to add a &quot;General store&quot; to my server, I have added the NPC, allowed the shop to open and configured what the shop holds.

So then I left-click the item and it displays how much the item will sell for, it&#39;s under-priced but that&#39;s easy to fix. 

But the problem is trying to sell the item to the store, it doesn&#39;t allow you to. (Picture provided below)

What would be the best way around allowing items to be sold in the store? I&#39;m not bothered about it even appearing in the store as I don&#39;t want people to be able to buy the items back.</description>

              <p>What did you set the shops selling/buying to?</p>
<p>This is what I use for my store that buys just about anything:</p>
<p><code>{
"id":1,
"name":"General Store",
"shopSellType":1,
"shopBuyType":1,
"currenyType":"COINS",
"shopItems":[]
}</code></p>
<p>You mostly need to be worried about the sell/buy type. The rest is rather useless to you.</p>

              <p>Go to the method that handles selling items to shops, and search for that message. Add an exception for that shop id. It’s not difficult</p>
