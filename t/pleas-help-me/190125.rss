Port forwarding (Router Users, Using [size=10pt]Linksys[/size])
You don&#39;t use linksys? Find your router at 
http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm
and follow the tutorial.

Open your cmd by going to Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd.
Type in `ipconfig´
It will say your default gateway.


Open a web browser like internet explorer or Netscape. Enter the gateway in the address bar of your browser. In the picture above the address bar has http://www.google.com in it. Just replace all of that with the ip address of your router. By default the ip address should be set to 192.168.1.1.


You should see a box prompting you for your username and password. Enter your username and password now. By default the username is blank, and the password is admin. Click the Ok button to log in to your router.


Click the Applications &amp; Gaming link near the top of the page.
The menu under that should change. In this new menu, click Port Range Forwarding. 


When you&#39;re finished, click Save Settings near the bottom of the screen to save your changes. 
Example:
Application Name: RSPS
Start - End Port: 43594-43594      (Change to which ports to want to enable)
Protocol: Both
To IP Address: Your IP at Start &gt; Run &gt; Cmd &gt; ipconfig
Enabled: Checked/Yes
