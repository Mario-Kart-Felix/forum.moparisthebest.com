    <title>Annoying Little Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/annoying-little-problem/52152</link>
    <description>I have been busy making my own shops for a server that I am planning on releasing sometime soon... however, 
I will often get errors saying that I have &quot;Used the wrong format&quot; when I am putting in the Item ID and the Item Amount. 

I will sit in my chair and simply stare at the rows of numbers trying to figure where it&#39;s gone wrong. Either I am not looking good enough, or I am missing something that I have no clue about. I got a screenie of one example:

[IMG]http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e120/cardboard-box/dude.jpg[/img]


The numbers in the red square are the ones that had the error. I even Copy/Pasted the top line, to show that everything is lined up correctly. It looks like every other row, except it has some random error which I cannot figure out for the life of me. (Also, if this helps, since the testscape source I am using has mental problems with most NPC&#39;s, I use already existing shops, and just change the Item ID and the Amount.)

So, if anyone has [i]any[/i] ideas of what I can do to fix this, it would be greatly appreciated, thanks.</description>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e120/cardboard-box/dude.jpg" title="dude.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e120/cardboard-box/dude.jpg" alt width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">dude.jpg</span><span class="informations">1024×768</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
