    <title>[PI] AutoCacheDownloader unpacking fix</title>

    <description>This tutorial may be deleted for how short it&#39;s going to be, but I had this problem for a day or so and I could not find ONE helpful tutorial.

First; if you have a spritedownloader class, DON&#39;T MESS WITH IT.

Second; Instead of compressing your cache files any other way select all of them, right click and hit add to archive.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

Make sure you select .zip as opposed to .rar. Finally, upload THAT .zip file to your dropbox or fileden. If you have the original client from your server find the cachedownloader.java, signlink.java, and if you have it spritedownloader.java and take them from the original client and move it to your client.

Now, in your signlink.java you will see something similar to this:

[code]  public static final String findcachedir()
  {
    File[] drives = File.listRoots();

    String HomeIsBaws = System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;);
    String s = HomeIsBaws + &quot;/GetTwistedCache/&quot;;
    File file = new File(s);
    if ((file.exists()) || (file.mkdirs())) {
      return s + &quot;/&quot;;
    }
    return null;
  }[/code]

String s = HomeIsBaws + &quot;/YOURCACHEHERE/&quot;;

replace &quot;YourCacheHere&quot; with the NAME of your cache (It&#39;s case sensitive so use the exact name of your cache.zip). The slashes (/) may be needed, but may not. In my case this was keeping my cache from being read properly (I forgot to add them). 

Finally, replace the links in cachedownloader and spritedownloader with your links from earlier (dropbox or fileden). Compile everything, delete the old cache in your C drive and try again!
