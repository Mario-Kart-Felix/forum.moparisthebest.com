    <title>Connection help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-help/294579</link>
    <description>So the error is... I can&#39;t connect using my No-IP Address. Using 127.0.0.0 and 0.0.0.0 is perfectly fine but using my No-IP address doesn&#39;t work at all. So i tried opening my ports in my firewalls  and port forwarding (which was already done just redid it). Then i tried again but it didn&#39;t work. I tried renewing my No-IP address. Still didn&#39;t work. AFTER ALL THAT WORK I was able to accomplish one small thing. When the server is turned on my google status checker would say it&#39;s online!! I would a receive a connection my my status checker but for some reason I still couldn&#39;t connect. The client works fine. I tested it on other 508 servers (Mine is also 508). So I know it isn&#39;t my client. My firewalls are all allowing port 43594 and my router is open.

There is also an error i get when i try to connect.

error_game_Js5connect

Many posts say that this error is caused because the server is offline. But MY server was online. I ran it AFTER I turned on the server. My status checker even confirms it&#39;s online so I&#39;m pretty sure it is online 100%. I ran my server before the no-ip worked before as well. Just for some reason yesterday it got busted.</description>

              <p>Nope it’s correct. I’ve put for the name 43594, ports “end” and “start” 43594, and TCP and i enabled it.</p>
<p>Do you guys think it can be caused from slow internet connection? Recently my internet provider has gone through some technical issues and maybe that could have caused it. ALL my setting were working before it just recently start to go that way. This isn’t my first time setting it up. It worked last night just happened to stop <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

He is right<br>
Happened to me when i was a beginner<br>
Goto a help website for portforwarding or just click <a href="http://portforward.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></p>
