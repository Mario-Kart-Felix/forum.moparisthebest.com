    <title>Runescape Rights :O (First post ^_^!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-rights-o-first-post--/521816</link>
    <description>Hey guys! First post- new to the community ^_^!

But to start off my first post, who all believes that it is BS that you must have a membership to actually play the classics. I mean really, Iv had my account since the classics where here all the way to present Runescape but  now i got to get a membership to replay it and restart all over again from level 1? I love and miss the Runescape Classics but i honestly don&#39;t belive it is right for Jagex to make it where you have to have a Membership (also making a whole new account pretty much)</description>

<p>Nope, that thing is a legend! Seen ONE back in times, the disk of returning is blue with yellow dots or something…? The item I’m after was called “red card” or something. I remember that at the time my friend had collected 8 of these things by trading 'em for lots of coal or something. I just don’t have any clue where he disposed them!?</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Disk</span> of returning thou’, has anyone seen the live action of this thing? I was wanting to some day possibly enter the “dark realm” or what it was called, where these poor banned players were trapped! Now I’m going to Google the disk of returning too, maybe someone has been able to preserve a video of this thing…?</p>
<p>EDIT: I am one of these rare people that ate a pumpkin in RSC (I paid 8,5k to get it.) Also, I just had this memory of having one of my PK account’s bank having these junk objects from the Grim Reapers house!! Let’s see now…</p>

              <p>Gosh, I remember when bunny ears and scythes were appearing all over the world. (Different holidays.) Then this friend of my brother stole my account and decided to drop trade my bunny ears… He took about 10 minutes to understand “Oh, they cannot be seen when dropped by others!” Bye bye Easter special… I also had a random character shared with my friend but oh, the password went missing… Still remember thou’ the time when 70k was too much asked of santa hats! I even had a green and yellow phat, but those weren’t worth that much at these times… Shortly after I got rid of these “junks” they had a rocket-ascent to the moon and beyond in price. Suddenly the green halloween mask got a price from 40-55k to 300k+ and when I tried to trade about 650k (In free game that was quite much at the time, wasn’t rune platebody worth like 120k? Anybody oldschool enough?) for a red halloween mask (worth approx 550k) but got struck by my first and last item scam, I don’t know, this “Dutchawolf” or something along those lines guy got the mask out of the second trade window, where at this time was the lovely bug which was to lose connection at the point the other player had accepted the second trade window and POW! You have all the traded items…  :mad: Tried “report abuse” a few times but never got a reply of any sort! That was my Runescape motivation away for years. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Still, the time without trade limits and Grand Exchange… The age of the players having the power of prices in trades… The ages of these super oddities like the junk you could keep from the Grim Reapers garden. Are these still left? Or do players still find half wine jugs? I had lots of them when they changed the wine mechanics, but drank them as food in Wilderness, oh what a fool I’ve been…</p>
<p>OLDSCHOOL PLAYERS: What were these red “Floppy disk” looking items called? I cannot find the name anywhere, no pictures, no nothing!</p>
<p>I hope this isn’t one of those replies I did earlier today, no way of understanding…?</p>

They don’t even need to have the classic server up, they’re doing it FOR the players. At least the players can give back.</p>

              <p>Hey guys! First post- new to the community ^_^!</p>
<p>But to start off my first post, who all believes that it is BS that you must have a membership to actually play the classics. I mean really, Iv had my account since the classics where here all the way to present Runescape but  now i got to get a membership to replay it and restart all over again from level 1? I love and miss the Runescape Classics but i honestly don’t belive it is right for Jagex to make it where you have to have a Membership (also making a whole new account pretty much)</p>
