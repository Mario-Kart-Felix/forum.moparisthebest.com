    <title>Changing attack styles for custom weapons &amp; Changing punch/kick/block (unarmed)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-attack-styles-for-custom-weapons-changing-punch-kick-block-unarmed/426541</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently using a 317 base and have been trying to figure out how to change the attack styles for the custom whips I&#39;ve added for the past hour  :confused:

Im not sure if it&#39;s client sided, server sided, or both...
Basically it&#39;s just giving me Chop/Slash/Controlled/Block attack styles at the minute..
I&#39;m trying to get it to display &#39;Flick/Lash/Deflect&#39; (Or whatever the standard whip attack styles are)... 

Any ideas on how I&#39;d do this?


Also my Punch/Kick/Block are a little messed up, Punch trains defence, Kick trains attack and Block trains Strength.. 

I&#39;ve managed to sort the animations out properly, but couldn&#39;t find out where or how to change which experience you gained from them?

All help is appreciated and +REP will be given to good answers..
Thanks! :)</description>

<li>You can’t rep++</li>
<li>The mixed Experience problem can probably be found and fixed under ActionButton packets.</li>
