    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-day-was-horrible-yesterday/38678</link>
    <description>okey first i stayed up all night the night before,

then i had to ride a mile to get to my mothers

then i had to go to rochdale and walk round there all day

then on the way back we was the second car behind the car at the traffic lights, he then set of and this 13 year old kid just walked out infront of him,


the kid walked into this women and looked down the road but not to his right and just clipped the van

he was on the floor was a bad head injury and blood coming out fast, he was ko&#39;d for about 5 minutes and then he woke up and went unconcious again and about another 5 minutes later he woke up crying.. the police were on scene shortly after..

luckly the van that hit himwas one of those toyota vans with the flat front, but it still hit his head first but if it had been a car it would of been a harder inpact..


in total there were 2 police cars, 2 traffic police cars and a ambulance..


that was the second person ive seen get run over this year.

and also a couple of weeks ago a women was killed by a moterbike as she came up from london in search of her family.</description>

<p>no you fail iamafisher cause you’re a fag and stop flaming everyone you asshole you probably have no friends in the real world so you go to taking it out on people in forums, if this was at a school/college/university you probably wouldnt have the guts to flame anyone and if you did you’d realise that you need to start showing respect to people…</p>

<p>While were throwing random facts around, I could say that you probably have no life and you probably get made fun of at school, and you even get made fun of here.</p>
<p>Just a random fact with no proof to support it though. iamafisher = cool. You guys just don’t know him very well <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

Look, how is this affecting you in a way, its just a fucking car crash, you see worse on CNN.</p>
<p>And you complain about riding 1 mile? Big fucking whoop? 1 measly mile? How long did that take you? I run 2 miles in about 7 minutes. and thats running, not riding.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Really now? 3:30 miles? Thats amazing consider the world record is like 3:32.[/quote]</p>
<p>I was hoping some people could pick up on some overeggsageration. But obviously, because of your lack of intelligence and your incompetent mind, you have averted to taking me literally, and as such, tried to launch a pathetic attack.</p>

<p>And you complain about riding 1 mile? Big fucking whoop? 1 measly mile? How long did that take you? I run 2 miles in about 7 minutes. and thats running, not riding.[/quote]<br>
Really now? 3:30 miles? Thats amazing consider the world record is like 3:32.</p>

<p>lmao you stfu i ride 20 mile uphill sometimes, i do alot of riding, i aint really complaining about that…</p>
<p>and its different when you watch on cnn but when you see a 13 year old kid get run over you go into shock unless your some kind of heartless nob head who doesnt car.</p>
<p>oh and if you had of noticed… the 2 topics are different</p>
<p>so instead of flaming, go do something better.</p>
<p>oh the only reason why i put the bike thing was because i stayed up all night before and i was very tired lol</p>

And I can run a mile in about 5 min and Im in 8th grade. So if you were riding I dont see how that messed up your day at all. Even though I dont really like him iamafisher is right.</p>
