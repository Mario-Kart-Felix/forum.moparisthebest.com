    <title>Banned Items?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/banned-items/31024</link>
    <description>I read the tut, but the tut says to put it somewhere in my client.java, and i cannot find a place, i get an error no matter what. If someone knows the code and where i could put it in TESTSCAPE client.java please tell me, and if you could add a code than could you please? What i mean by banned items is to make an item be worn only by a mod or admin or just 1 person of my choice. For example, if a normal player trys to wear a...red phat it wouldnt let him, or even be able to have that item in their inventory. If you can help me please do, it would be greatly appreciated.[br][size=1]Posted at: November 30, 2006, 05:18:02 PM[/size][hr]Anyone?</description>
