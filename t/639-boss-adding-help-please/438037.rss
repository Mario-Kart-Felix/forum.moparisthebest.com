    <title>(639) Boss adding! - Help please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/639-boss-adding-help-please/438037</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, me and my coder have been having really bad trouble with boss adding, We are currently adding Nomad but He isnt hitting correctly, We coded the NomadAction.java and Nomad.java files, but he just won&#39;t attack right, We have tried loads of tutorials but none seem to help.  Can anyone help us out on how to make him Fully work, Do we need any other file to make him work or have we just coded something wrong? Please help.
