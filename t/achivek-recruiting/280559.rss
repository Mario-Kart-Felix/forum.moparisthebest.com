    <title>Achivek - Recruiting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/achivek-recruiting/280559</link>
    <description>Hello, 
    I am currently recruiting people that are experienced in Java for a new project. This project involves making a stable server and turning it into a server where a stable economy, and bug fixes are our first priority. Most of the topics in the server development section sound encouraging, this thread may not sound encouraging at all, but I have been a C++ programmer for 3 years, I am currently getting used to java, it&#39;s pretty much the same cake. I&#39;m aiming on making a server like Dodian for example, where stability and bugs are very important, I am also aiming on making the server official, with a lot of fun things. 

Some things to keep in mind :
             Hosting is not an issue, I currently have 2 PC&#39;s, each one of them being a quad core with 4GB ram designed for hosting servers, I do have two other computers, but they are hosting WoW servers with about 1000+ Active users, I run a fiber optic connection.

I used to be  a big fan of RS Private Servers, but later in time I lost interest, my interest has returned. If you are interested on making a stable and economy / Skill and PVP based server, to be released officially and make a turn point please do not hesitate. Whoever participates, I strongly encourage you do not work with any other projects while working with Achivek, my past experience tells me allot of conflicts arrive.


-------------------

Keep in mind we are recruiting Java EXPERIENCED Programmers. Once enough people gets accumulated we will have a meeting and a discussion about what source to base it on, and wipeing the source to 0. If you are interested please send me a private message, I have MSN, I will talk and contact you through it.

              <p>I recommend using Yz’s server base, it’s stable and you can learn something from it. Atleast it’s vetter than most of the servers.</p>

<p>It was an example…And I’m not talking about the current shitty dodian leeched based servers, I’m talking about the official dodian and its stability.</p>
