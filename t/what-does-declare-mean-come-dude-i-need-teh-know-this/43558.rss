    <description>Ok, i&#39;m a coder, but a beginner coder as you can see in RS2 Server Advertisement I have a great server for a beginner with friendly mods and staffs including me also. I went on RS2 Server Tutorials and seen a TuT say somethen about declaring, so i&#39;m just talking to myself say &quot;WTF is declaring?&quot; (lol) and was just wondering what it was. I went and looked it up in a dictionary but that didnt succeed in knowing what declare means in Java, so I just need to know what declaring mean. Does anyone know what declaring mean? (Of course someone should know (lol).)</description>

              <p>alright declareing is like making a new void. such as <code>public void println_debug(String str) {
		System.out.println("[client-"+playerId+"-"+playerName+"]: "+str);
	}</code> which is just an example in my client.  basically how u do it is search <code>void</code> in your client and under the last <span class="bbcode-b">}</span> add the void they tell u to add</p>
