    <description>I need a good compiler with a autorestart the 1 im using isn&#39;t working properly when it says the port is already 

being used and i would have to put it backup myself each time.

It said 10min 12min 14min 16min 18min and 20min 

i put in 20min and it did that

so now im trying just put in 20 and see if that works.

But can someone post another good autorestarter.</description>
