    <title>The one day ban project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-one-day-ban-project/160151</link>
    <description>Hi, as a project realising the idiocracy of Jagex and their suprising lack of priority in banning those who really abuse the system over those who drop an f bomb now and then, i have decided to create an experiment to see if it is really possible.

The goal:
My goal is to start with my account i made at 11:00 Pm PST on 11/23/07 and get it permanently banned with 10+ black marks by 11:00 Pm 11/24/07 by breaking as many rules as possible.

Rules:
-No one I know can help me, by reporting any of my offences and following me around.
-I must log out by 11:00 tomarrow.
-To be successful I must have 10/10 blackmarks. Added bonus is to be perm muted/48 hour muted.

I will be doing this experiment completely in world 17. Feel free to add me and follow my progress.

Progress:

11:49 PM 11/23/07
update:Hello, I&#39;m trying to get some black marks without getting muted right away so I&#39;m saving some of my other stuff until later tonight but I&#39;ll be putting up screen shots and videos of what I am doing until the project is over.

This was only 1 minute in to the real start of the project! Haha XD Some people are morons.

12:12 AM 11/24/07
Someone has done a bunch of work for me! They asked if I was a &#39;gm&#39; referring to Jagex staff! They now think  I&#39;m making them a player mod so everyone else reported me for impersonating staff one giant step!

12:30 AM 11/24/07
Successfully hacked not one but 2 of that guys accounts! Wow he fell right into it... thats i believe 20 black marks? ^_^

12:52 AM 11/24/07 
I am giving him back his stuff since he obviously likes the game but is not an awsome player just showing him what could have happened. I&#39;m not that mean.

The haul:

10:46 AM 11/24/07:

11:19 AM 11/24/07:
All of the offences are now appealed! Time to wait for the response!

11:36 AM 11/24/07:
The offences have now gone up to 30.9 blackmarks! xD

i think i got 80+ something black marks for using “Ron’s auto rule breaker” and that was for only a few minutes standing in world 1 using it.</p>
