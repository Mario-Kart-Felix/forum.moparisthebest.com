    <title>Adding ::newhpbar and ::oldhpbar commands</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-newhpbar-and-oldhpbar-commands/375867</link>
    <description>How would I be able to add something like ::newhpbar and ::oldhpbar? I have the new hitpoint bars, but some people prefer the older ones. I don&#39;t want them to HAVE to play with the new ones, so how would I be able to make this command? Also, how could i add ::newhits and ::oldhits? The newhits is added client sided but is set to false, so newhits is off right now. PI based client.</description>
