    <description>i have a 667/700 source and there was an account on there that was admin, i copied that account and switched the username so i have an admin account.
Now when i try and do things for donators it says your not a donator, how can i make it so admins surpass donor rank or how do i make people donors on a 667
Staff confuses me on this because there is no giveowner giveadmin givemod or givedonor
