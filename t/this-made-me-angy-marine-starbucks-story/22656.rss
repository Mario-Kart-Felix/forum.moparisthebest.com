    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-made-me-angy-marine-starbucks-story/22656</link>
    <description>ok b4 i start i would like to say a few things one bieng that the only reason this story made me made was because my mom went to iraq for war for a total for 3.5 years, btw true story,

ok some people may already knopw some may not but soldiers overseas often right letters to big companys like startbucks for example well they usally say somthing around the lines of &quot;hello i cannot get your products here can you help me and my fellow soldies out&quot; usally longer but recently i heard a true story from a marine and he wrote to starbuck asking for products and heres what starbucks wrote

&lt;blockquote&gt;we do not support or war or anybody in it&lt;/blockquote&gt;

its just a pice but saying they dont support the war is one thing but saying they dont support anybody in it?! this made me mad and aout 30 other people who have heard it, what to you think about it?</description>
