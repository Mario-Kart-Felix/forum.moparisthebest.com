    <title>Preinstalled Workstation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/preinstalled-workstation/338460</link>
    <description>Running Windows (Vista or 7), is there a way to create a custom workstation kind of thing where after installing the OS I can install a few programs, make a disc, and then use that disk to install everything on another computer?

I have multiple computers and generally have the same software on all of them. So when I update one computer I have to update the rest of them.

I&#39;m about to reformat my super computer and start over. My life would be TONS easier if I could do something like this.

Start over.
Install Windows.
Install all programs I want.
Create an installation.
Use that to install Windows and all the programs on every other PC.

Because currently, starting over and installing all my software over again on one PC is enough pain, but I&#39;d like to do it to all my PCs. I just don&#39;t have that kind of time and patience.</description>

That’s my main problem, I had no idea what to search for and workstations are a completely different thing.</p>
<p>Kind of the same thing as searching for miniature keyboards when you want digital piano type things and not typing things.<br>

<p>Found that out, but at the start I was lost in many searches and browses.</p>

<p>I used Ghost to make a backup of my laptop clean install with programs on it. The only thing is the laptop is the only one that has severely different hardware. And that was almost a year ago so the programs aren’t up to date.</p>
