    <title>Problem With Class files?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-class-files/48752</link>
    <description>Okay, I have a problem with class files...


Everytime I compile, instead of automatically making a class file, it leaves it, and I always get an error.

Is there a way to make it so you can make class files without auto making it? (I have done so) And if there is (I know you can) Everytime I add a code into it, it doesn&#39;t turn into the weird language.

And is there a way to fix my auto making class file thing?

If so..
HELP! xD</description>
