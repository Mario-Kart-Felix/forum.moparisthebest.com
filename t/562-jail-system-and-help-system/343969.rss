    <description>I have all the locations i want for my jail and help system.

I need to just have simple jail command for these coords &quot;2734 3466 0&quot;
And I need a command for if a player needs help they type ::help and it teles them to &quot; 2734 3469 0&quot; but it also has a server wide message saying &quot;(player name) needs assistance&quot; Then a admin or mod can type &quot;gohelp&quot; and it teles them to &quot; 2732 3469 0&quot; and has a server message saying &quot;(player name) is on their way&quot;  Can some one do this i know its alot to ask but i have no clue how to :(   Thanks</description>
