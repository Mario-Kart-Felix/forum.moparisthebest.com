    <title>Argh! Moparscape/Testscape .bat file trouble</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/argh-moparscape-testscape-bat-file-trouble/42084</link>
    <description>I can no longer open Moparscape.bat (the one that opens mopar) or runserver.bat (in testscape source folder)

My computer froze while using Mopar and playing on Testscape and when I restarted that screwed it up apparently and now I can no longer open them.

Help! :(

This is on my brand new custom built laptop that I got for christmas (I&#39;m 19 years old) and it&#39;s got Windows XP Home and I recently downloaded Java Environment 6.0 and the other thing needed to make your own server (6.0)

I tried making my own server but ended up on &quot;Testscape&quot; and loved it.




OFF TOPIC:

Does anyone have a list of commands for Mopar (the Aryan types &quot;::&lt;insert here&gt;&quot;)  I found some not listed like:
- ::emote &lt;insert number&gt; &lt;= Very glitchy, causes player to do weird glitchy emotes and never stop until logout.
- ::mod &lt; 0, 1 or 2&gt; (0=Player, 1: Player Mod, 2: Jagex Mod) Player type.</description>
