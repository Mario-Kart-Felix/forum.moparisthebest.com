              <p>They don’t support the same item id’s as the source you’re using. The source item.cfg and the Client’s class8 have to be compatible (the item id’s have to be the same and match up), otherwise you get nulls. A majority of the sources on here are made using silab’s client, so if galkon doesn’t use the same item dump, you’re source isn’t going to work pertaining to items.</p>
