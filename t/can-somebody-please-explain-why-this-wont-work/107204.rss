    <title>Can somebody please explain why this won&#39;t work?</title>

    <description>This is in Delphi 7SE

[code]if encoderadiobtn.Checked = true then
    encode;

  if decoderadiobtn.Checked = true then
    decode;

  if encoderadiobtn.Checked = false and decoderadiobtn.Checked = false then
    MessageDlg(&#39;Please choose encode or decode&#39; , mtError, [mbOk], 0,);[/code]
It is part of a start button procedure

It compiles and runs fine, except when I click start with them both unchecked the error doesn&#39;t come up when it should, encode runs the procedure and the message, (it should just run the procedure) and decode runs the procedure like it should.

What I want it to do, is display the message if none are checked, run the encode procedure if it is checked, and the decode procedure if it is checked.


I am sure this is something really stupid that I overlooked, but I have been trying to get this simple thing to work for about 20 minutes.

Can anybody tell me what I am doing wrong?</description>
