    <title>Some of my Models</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-of-my-models/336505</link>
    <description>I&#39;m fairly new to modeling, only been doing it for about 2 or 3 weeks.
I just thought I&#39;d showcase a few of my things here.

My Fender Stratocaster model. Took me about 2 and a half hours total.
The extra colors took like a minute each, all I had to do was change the mats.
YES, I know that I accidentally cut off the headstock in the picture, but I&#39;m too lazy to fix it.

Here&#39;s a few of my &quot;ModCapes.&quot;
My friend asked me to make these for him, so I did.

I&#39;ll post more when I feel like it. :\

Oh, by the way, if you wanna use any of these in your server,
It&#39;s fine by me. I don&#39;t care. Just PM me about it.</description>

<p>I’m pretty sure nobody believed that. I think they’re just appreciating the model rather than quantity.</p>
