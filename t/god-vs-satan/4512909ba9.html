<blockquote>
<p>Religion is an opinion, a belief, a faith. Not made up of scientific hypotheses. Atheists sit and read about theories that have been made, when we as Christians don’t need some equation to prove how we got here. Think about that when you look up from whatever science magazine your reading, and realize 33% of the world is gone. You will sit there and remember this. Along with everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You say that like being an opinion makes religion superior to science (PS they aren’t opposite things), yes you don’t need an equation to prove how you got here, you just need your parents telling you that a man in the sky created us from dirt.</p>
<p>Finally, what does “33% of the world is gone” have to do with anything?</p>

<p>I will from now on worship Stalin’s Russia, for their sacrifice in WWII.<br>
Because in both cases, let us forget one important detail. Russia needed to make that sacrifice to beat the shit out of the invaders. The problem is that God sacrificed Jesus without reason. He made the rules, he made that strange loophole, he started he whole sacrifice idea.</p>
<p>Neither is good because of their sacrifices, because one of them had to, and one of them didn’t need to. You could however say that God’s action was evil, since he killed his son without reason. He could just forgive without the need of a human sacrifice, but he wanted that sacrifice.</p>

<p>Neither is good because of their sacrifices, because one of them had to, and one of them didn’t need to. You could however say that God’s action was evil, since he killed his son without reason.

Like I tell everyone if you don’t understand someone’s religion don’t try to criticize it, because you obviously don’t understand the difference between God the father, God the son, and God the Holy spirit.</p>

Satan hates, God loves, God wants everyone to come with him to heaven, and he gives everyone a choice to pick heaven or hell. However most human beings fear what they don’t understand.

<p>“Satan hates, God loves, God wants everyone to come with him to heaven, and he gives everyone a choice to pick heaven or hell.”<br>
Then he should fix his flawed rules.</p>
<p>“However most human beings fear what they don’t understand.”<br>
I don’t fear God.</p>
<p>"Stalin doesn’t keep you alive, "<br>
He kicked out the Nazis from my country, not God. God watched the Germans exterminating 6 million Jews and killing many millions. The German army had “Gott mit uns” as slogan, so they were in fact killed in Gods name.</p>
<p>“God does, he has the powers to take away your life,”<br>
That doesn’t make him nice.</p>
<p>“it’s a miracle that you wake up every morning, it’s a miracle that you can talk, Eat, and walk.”<br>
I wanted you do prove that God was nice, not a psychopath.</p>
<p>“To tell you the reason why God hasn’t proven himself to Earth, is that, God has actually revealed himself in the past. Why does he have to keep on repeating the same thing over and over again?”<br>
For two-thousand years ago, Stalin showed himself  several times, and we have pictures of him. I think God is shy. Not a very al-mighty behaviour.</p>
<p>“For a future question ‘Who created God if God created everything?’.<br>
Simple answer God wasn’t created he always was, always is and always will be.”<br>
God is a man made idea.</p>
<p>“If we were to understand everything about God then he wouldn’t be God. Would he?”<br>
Sorry, no contradictions here.</p>
<p>Forget my comparison with a dictator, your description of God makes him sound like a cult leader. How can you call that behaviour loving?</p>

I wanted you do prove that God was nice, not a psychopath.</p>
<p>“To tell you the reason why God hasn’t proven himself to Earth, is that, God has actually revealed himself in the past. Why does he have to keep on repeating the same thing over and over again?”<br>
For two-thousand years ago, Stalin showed himself  several times, and we have pictures of him. I think God is shy. Not a very al-mighty behaviour.</p>
<p>“For a future question ‘Who created God if God created everything?’.<br>
Simple answer God wasn’t created he always was, always is and always will be.”<br>
God is a man made idea.</p>
<p>“If we were to understand everything about God then he wouldn’t be God. Would he?”<br>
Sorry, no contradictions here.</p>
<p>Forget my comparison with a dictator, your description of God makes him sound like a cult leader. How can you call that behaviour loving?[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>Love, what is the definition of love? you’re not seeing the big picture, what you might see as love could be the complete opposite for someone else. Example, Hitler killed thousands of jews, what he did was wrong, but in his mind set he believe it to be right.<br>
The War in Iraq, Most Americans believe that the war on Iraq is a good cause, a few thousand Americans die. So what happens is the united states government declares war and kills way more then the American people who were killed in 9/11.</li>
</ol>
<p>I could love a small kitten, and you could hate that small kitten. So if the kitten was sick and the kitten was dieing, you’d be happy and I’d be in a state of depression.</p>
<p>You can’t try and criticize God if you Know close to nothing about his exists or how he thinks.</p>

OK, now I stop. I see no reason to exchange more words with you. First you come with an flawed argument, and then you are accusing Iraq for attacking you? Did you forget that Afghanistan was the terror war, and Iraq was the war on false premises.</p>

Wait wait, Mr.heatrn11 can fix this hold on. BACK TO THE TALK ABOUT GOD FORGET what i said about 9/11.</p>
<p>Anyways I never said hitler loved them i said he thought it was right. If a cat takes a shit in the woods and no one is around to smell it does it still make a smell? Well by what you’re saying it would be a no, because by what you’re saying , if one cannot see something then it’s obviously not there. 7 years ago <a href="http://youtube.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com</a> was released to the public right?Before youtube was released did you know it was in development? if yes, then someone had to tell you, meaning someone had to tell that person, and another person had to tell that person, makes a whole train. What I’m trying to say is that humans are insignificant beings who have barley even scratched the surface of the universe.</p>
<p>If you were to look at an entire community of Animals, Each animal has a certain action or job it’s suppose to perform, they all help each other to survive. Decomposition, now how could something so complex like decomposition of a dead animal or a dead plant be something that spontaneously happened over time. That’s pretty retarded if you ask me. Only an intelligent designer or creator rather, could put the universe together and make every single particle work with each other.</p>
<p>Can i ask you a question?</p>
<p>[font=arial black]How was the universe formed?[/font]</p>
