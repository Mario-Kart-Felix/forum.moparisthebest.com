From what I’ve heard, God created everything and knows everything past, present and future. He clearly knew the fate of Satan. You seem to have dodged the question: why does God need ‘our’ help to defeat Satan (assuming God &gt; Satan)? It tale reads as a tug between the two (equality).</p>

I think PBS can better explain the first part of your reply:</p>
<blockquote>3. If fish became amphibians through the process of evolution, then why do fish still exist?	 
<p>Fossil evidence clearly shows that amphibians descended from one group of ancient fishes whose thick, bony fins gradually evolved into limb-like appendages. Other species gave rise to the kinds of fish that inhabit oceans, lakes, and streams around the world today. Fish, like all living creatures, continue to evolve. This evolution is not toward a life on land, but instead toward successful use of the underwater environment. There are countless ecological opportunities under water, which is why fish still exist. When the earliest ancestors of modern amphibians left the water, they found many new opportunities on land. As amphibians and other land creatures diversified, however, fewer and fewer opportunities existed for newcomers.</p>

We developed from ape-like creatures? Well where are they now?<br>
There isn’t enough evidence for God? Like there is evidence for anything you believe in? I once read a passage with someone lecturing about the big bang, and apparently, these “ape-like” creatures evolved from the slime of rocks after a rain.<br>

I think PBS can better explain the first part of your reply:</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>If fish became amphibians through the process of evolution, then why do fish still exist?</li>
</ol>
<p>Fossil evidence clearly shows that amphibians descended from one group of ancient fishes whose thick, bony fins gradually evolved into limb-like appendages. Other species gave rise to the kinds of fish that inhabit oceans, lakes, and streams around the world today. Fish, like all living creatures, continue to evolve. This evolution is not toward a life on land, but instead toward successful use of the underwater environment. There are countless ecological opportunities under water, which is why fish still exist. When the earliest ancestors of modern amphibians left the water, they found many new opportunities on land. As amphibians and other land creatures diversified, however, fewer and fewer opportunities existed for newcomers.</p>

<p>From what I’ve heard, God created everything and knows everything past, present and future. He clearly knew the fate of Satan. You seem to have dodged the question: why does God need ‘our’ help to defeat Satan (assuming God &gt; Satan)? It tale reads as a tug between the two (equality).</p>

</aside>
<p>do you realise that the term ‘big bang’ was coined by a scientist who was opposed to the theory? the term ‘big bang’ was adopted because it conveys some of the theory of the big bang to anyone who doesn’t understand the underlying mechanisms behind it, the term itself is horribly inaccurate and does more of a disservice than it does a service because we end up with ignorant dopes like you believing anything you read that supports your opinion, such as “humans came from a firey explosion in the sky!@”@“£~£”“£”</p>
<p>the big bang is not an explosion and no scientist ever claimed it was, the ‘big bang’ is an <span class="bbcode-i">expansion</span> of space-time and we can observe that expansion today, the distinction is extremely important and the overall theory is much, MUCH more complicated than what can be conveyed in a paragraph or two</p>

<p>PS, humans are part of the great ape family, humans are apes, humans, bonobos and chimpanzees are closely related, this is an observed fact</p>

</aside>
<p>the evidence is there, and to be perfectly frank you are too ignorant to want to read it and likely will not understand it without having training to be able to understand it (just because you have a workshop manual for a car does not mean you are a mechanic, for instance)</p>
<p>the big bang theory (developmental process of the early universe) has nothing to do with abiogenesis (origins of life on earth), and abiogenesis has nothing to do with the theory of evolution (diversity of life found in nature) which again is different from the biological function evolution (descent with change), they are all separate entities and you treat them as if they were interchangeable, no wonder you claim the evidence is all bogus when clearly the “evidence” you are viewing is misleading at the very least if they claim these theories or functions are interchangeable terms</p>
<p>but of course the evidence for each of these theories is massive, and it is not accessible in a handy little book form like the bible is, as the evidence for the theories are scientific research papers and lots of them and scientific research papers are too damn dull and technical for the average joe to interpret them as shown by any number of scientific journalists claiming a cure for x, y or z has been found when in reality they couldn’t be further from the truth, scientific papers are not written for the average person and use terms that are not defined the same way they are in common language (theory for one, scientific theory and common usage theory have completely different meanings), the best way to understand a scientific paper is to start by getting a background in the terms and language scientists use, even better would to take a year or two course in that field of science basic 101, even better would be to have a bachelors degree in that field of science with experience in research</p>
<p>science is not a chain where if a single link break the whole thing falls on its ass</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They found fossils of fish? If the fish who evolved, did evolve, how did they leave back fossils?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>evolution in the real world is not akin to how it is in pokemon</p>
<p>first I want to explain what a species is, a species is a group of animals that can generally interbreed and produce a successful offspring, if you fuck a human and they have a baby, you and your partner are the same species and the baby shares half of each parents genes, if however you fuck something else and cannot produce an offspring, it is likely you aren’t of the same species (extremely oversimplified example)</p>
<p>now, consider for a moment that a a group from a species gets separated for a long period of time (thousands of years plus), the species doesn’t necessarily have to be separated they just can’t interbreed, given enough time and selective environmental pressures the new group species may develop slight but different features(thicker coat of hair etc), these new genetic features may thrive in the new group but may remain relatively isolated in the parent group (but still there nonetheless if they originated from the parent group), genes can be bred out given enough time in the larger population isolating the smaller populations genes even more</p>
<p>given enough time it will become clear to anyone studying the remains of the animals (timespan: thousands, tens of thousands of years) that a group of the species was isolated and genes that better helped the group survive (thicker skin, hair etc) were selectively kept through environmental pressures while the parent group who didn’t have these pressures weren’t under any selection to make those genes prominent</p>
<p>you now have fossils from two groups of the same species, albeit you will have fossils of a species and a diverging subspecies, which can readily be confirmed by environmental factors along with genetics and observations of the remains, given enough time and the isolated species may inbreed enough that it is no longer capable of breeding with the parent species and you’ll have a new species and a transition of fossils to show such</p>
<p>a real world example of this although not applicable to my hypothetical scenario is wolves and dogs, believe it or not wolves and dogs belong to the same species and can interbreed and while dogs are a merely a subspecies it’s an interesting observation, you’d think wolves are wolves and dogs are dogs and that was that but the reality is that dogs are still wolves for now despite having some glaring behaviour and appearance differences</p>
<p>another real world example is horses and donkeys, and this is where it gets a little complicated, horses and donkeys are technically different species but are in the same family and are very closely related, so much so that if you mate a female horse with a male donkey you (may) get a mule, on the other hand if you breed a male horse with a female donkey you will get a hinny, the chances of successful hinny offspring are extremely slim compared to mules which from my understanding is pretty uncommon as well, another interesting fact is mules are almost always sterile, mules are not a species but are a hybrid of horses and donkeys</p>
<p>tl;dr what the hell am I getting at? one whole species does not simply evolve into a new species and any speciation is a slow and gradual change occurring after hundreds and thousands of generations</p>
<p>fun fact, 99.99% of evolutionary lines are extinct, and 99.9% of all species that have ever lived are now extinct, hell, 8 species have thought to gone extinct since 2000</p>

        <p>Once again i am not religious but this is my theory. Satan or Lucifer if you would was once Gods bitch, Arch Angel Micheal was told to rip off Lucifer’s wings and toss him to what you now Hell which is meant to be a cage. Well if Micheal could handle Lucifer and Micheal is also Gods bitch wouldn’t you think that God would win? Stupid question tbh</p>

<p>Religion is an opinion, a belief, a faith. Not made up of scientific hypotheses. Atheists sit and read about theories that have been made, when we as Christians don’t need some equation to prove how we got here. Think about that when you look up from whatever science magazine your reading, and realize 33% of the world is gone. You will sit there and remember this. Along with everyone else.</p>

<p>you’ve successfully stated that you blindly follow something entirely because it’s your opinion or belief… which probably explains why nothing anyone says goes through your head, because anything that doesn’t follow along the line of your personal opinion means jack shit and has zero significance in any argument</p>

        <p>If God is Omnipotent (as followers are taught to believe), then he knows all, and has all of the power. Therefore, if there was really a “battle”, in which God and the Angels are fighting Satan and the Demons, then logically, they would be close-to, if not perfectly matched in terms of strength and ability. Meaning that Satan would inherently be as powerful as God. If not, there would be no war, there would be no fight. God could simply cast him out if he wanted. Since he hasn’t, God is permitting evil to exist, and also permitting the spread of evil to exist.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but if when I die, I’m standing at some golden gates, being judged by God, I’d tell him to shove it and send me to hell where I belong.</p>
<p>Being an Atheist or Agnostic, Realist, etc does not make you an immoral person. It just means you don’t believe in something you can’t observe.</p>
<p>In fact, if we weren’t meant to think logically, and use the abilities of reason to question God, he wouldn’t have needed to “tempt” humans, because he knew we would defy him. In which case, God caused us to be evil sinners (think police telling a guy to steal a car, then sending him to jail for it).</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>theories are not “made” though, at least not in the sense you’re thinking, theories are explanations to observed natural phenomena that are supported by the available evidence, want to know how we can “predict” tide times? thank the theory of gravity for one, we know how the moon orbits the earth and we can predict it with a high level of accuracy, and we can get tide times months and years in advanced thanks to some basic underlying theories</p>
<p>ps, a scientific theory has a different definition than the common-usage definition of theory, a conspiracy theory does NOT hold a candle of merit compared to a scientific theory, and neither does belief, opinion or faith</p>
<p>pps, the difference is that you christians can’t prove how you got here(and not only because proving something requires proof), you can only speculate based on preconceived notions that you wouldn’t have if you didn’t read a book, and thanks to word of mouth you don’t even need to read the book to have these notions, it is not a coincidence that christians think upon similar lines, it’s because people can’t escape your intoxicating grip on impressionable young minds who grow up to be closed minded ignorant minds</p>
<p>impressionable young minds and ignorant older generations will lead you to believe in unicorns and an that a man was made from dirt and a woman from a man’s rib, science can tell you why people are inclined to believe in the supernatural in the first place</p>

(He’s afraid of clowns! )</p>
<p>but no  seriously I kept it as unbiased as possible. What in reality do we know about two figures who are in a religious debacle for souls?</p>
<p>There are no real records that state what God can do besides the Bible stating that he has power over life and death. Now, what does Satan have? He just has power to tempt up to the point of not killing somebody supposedly. That is from a bible related stand view. I don’t  know a lot about other cultures but that’s what I gather from the Holy Text.</p>
