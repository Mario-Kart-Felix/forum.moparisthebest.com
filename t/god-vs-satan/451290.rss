<p>If a person who does not believe in God states they believe in Satan then they are not a real atheist. If they claim they have never seen God/jesus then how can they claim they know what Satan looks like, have they seen Satan? Or is that just their  mind?</p>

Yes, everyone likes seeing Hitler getting pineapples up his ass.<br>

<p>But the idea of Satan as a red man with horn is stupid, it sound either catholic or like American propaganda. Satan is a serpent and that’s it. And no, you don’t need believe in anything. I have lost all faith in God, the world and humanity.</p>

Well obviously. This what going to turn into a religious debate no matter what, to bad the OP could not have foreseen this.</p>
<p>[quote=“ytuio9`, post:44, topic:451290”]So I really don’t know much about evolution and the origins of the world (egyptian) but this post is really funny.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Religion is an opinion, a belief, a faith. Not made up of scientific hypotheses. Atheists sit and read about theories that have been made, when we as Christians don’t need some equation to prove how we got here. Think about that when you look up from whatever science magazine your reading, and realize 33% of the world is gone. You will sit there and remember this. Along with everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You say that like being an opinion makes religion superior to science (PS they aren’t opposite things), yes you don’t need an equation to prove how you got here, you just need your parents telling you that a man in the sky created us from dirt.</p>
<p>Finally, what does “33% of the world is gone” have to do with anything?[/quote]<br>
According to records, 33% of the world believes in Christianity, this may not be accurate, but its just what I found. What I mean by it is according to the scriptures, when God feels it is time he will send his son back to world, at that time all of his followers will be sent to heaven unharmed in an event called the rapture.

<p>“1) Love, what is the definition of love? you’re not seeing the big picture, what you might see as love could be the complete opposite for someone else. Example, Hitler killed thousands of jews, what he did was wrong, but in his mind set he believe it to be right.”</p>
<p>Hitler hated Jews and several other groups. You can’t say that he was in some way loving towards them.</p>
<p>“The War in Iraq, Most Americans believe that the war on Iraq is a good cause, a few thousand Americans die. So what happens is the united states government declares war and kills way more then the American people who were killed in 9/11.”<br>
OK, now I stop. I see no reason to exchange more words with you. First you come with an flawed argument, and then you are accusing Iraq for attacking you? Did you forget that Afghanistan was the terror war, and Iraq was the war on false premises.[/quote]<br>
Wait wait, Mr.heatrn11 can fix this hold on. BACK TO THE TALK ABOUT GOD FORGET what i said about 9/11.</p>
<p>Anyways I never said hitler loved them i said he thought it was right. If a cat takes a shit in the woods and no one is around to smell it does it still make a smell? Well by what you’re saying it would be a no, because by what you’re saying , if one cannot see something then it’s obviously not there. 7 years ago <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com</a> was released to the public right?Before youtube was released did you know it was in development? if yes, then someone had to tell you, meaning someone had to tell that person, and another person had to tell that person, makes a whole train.

<p>If you were to look at an entire community of Animals, Each animal has a certain action or job it’s suppose to perform, they all help each other to survive. Decomposition, now how could something so complex like decomposition of a dead animal or a dead plant be something that spontaneously happened over time. That’s pretty retarded if you ask me. Only an intelligent designer or creator rather, could put the universe together and make every single particle work with each other.</p>
<p>Can i ask you a question?</p>

<p>Hitler hated Jews and several other groups. You can’t say that he was in some way loving towards them.</p>
<p>“The War in Iraq, Most Americans believe that the war on Iraq is a good cause, a few thousand Americans die. So what happens is the united states government declares war and kills way more then the American people who were killed in 9/11.”<br>
OK, now I stop. I see no reason to exchange more words with you. First you come with an flawed argument, and then you are accusing Iraq for attacking you? Did you forget that Afghanistan was the terror war, and Iraq was the war on false premises.</p>

<p>I could love a small kitten, and you could hate that small kitten. So if the kitten was sick and the kitten was dieing, you’d be happy and I’d be in a state of depression.</p>
<p>You can’t try and criticize God if you Know close to nothing about his exists or how he thinks.</p>

<p>I will from now on worship Stalin’s Russia, for their sacrifice in WWII.<br>
Because in both cases, let us forget one important detail. Russia needed to make that sacrifice to beat the shit out of the invaders. The problem is that God sacrificed Jesus without reason. He made the rules, he made that strange loophole, he started he whole sacrifice idea.</p>
<p>Neither is good because of their sacrifices, because one of them had to, and one of them didn’t need to. You could however say that God’s action was evil, since he killed his son without reason. He could just forgive without the need of a human sacrifice, but he wanted that sacrifice.</p>

              <p>God is more of a peaceful character, who created the world. I am not surprised at the amount of people saying Satan would win due to his personality. Although, God will do anything to protect things he loves. I mean, he had his son crucified to save the whole human race.</p>

Jesus was just the mortal shell  on  earth. He has no  real powers. I don’t consider faith being a weapon because it was used to perform miracles not kick somebodies ass.</p>
