Exactly my point, you’re scared to go beyond the mindset of a human being so you reject something that doesn’t make sense in your mind. Yet you don’t try and understand it you just reject it.</p>

Actually God allows evil, god allows everything, the reason why he created us was to worship him or something like that no really sure.

That doesn’t make sense. Is evil a test? God could have most certainly created a world without it - and, according to the bible, he did! Adam/Eve. If I recall correctly, he punishes the two for eating an apple, but the reason for eating the apple was triggered by the appearance of the serpent… which had to have been created by god. If god knew history and what is to come, doesn’t that mean he could have stopped the serpent/eve? Why didn’t he? So is god just an asshole that likes to test people and send them into damnation for not obeying his orders?</p>

Tell me [size=1pt]idiot[/size], t4, what is your religion of choice? Do you think we evolved from orangutangs? Or a big fiery explosion brought us all here? You see, God seems more real than the other too don’t you think? Do evolutionists have a book that was passed down from the beginning of time? No they don’t, because they think we came from a bunch of fucking monkeys. Do those who think the big bang brought us here have a book? No. If they did it would go something like this,</p>

Tell me [size=1pt]idiot[/size], t4, what is your religion of choice? Do you think we evolved from orangutangs? Or a big fiery explosion brought us all here? You see, God seems more real than the other too don’t you think? Do evolutionists have a book that was passed down from the beginning of time? No they don’t, because they think we came from a bunch of fucking monkeys. Do those who think the big bang brought us here have a book? No. If they did it would go something like this,</p>

<p>In order:</p>
<p>I don’t practice a religion, I am an atheist. I don’t know the direct lineage of the evolution chain, but yes, we evolved from ape-like creatures. Fiery explosion? You mean the big bang? No I don’t think so, just because something goes over your head doesn’t mean it’s false - especially, when there’s clear evidence stating otherwise. Beginning of time? By who’s standards? Humans were on earth far longer than the publication of the first testament. There’s quite an extensive reading about the big bang and such, perhaps you should check it out.</p>

<p>Actually God allows evil, god allows everything, the reason why he created us was to worship him or something like that no really sure.

<p>“because who would God be if he controlled our every actions.”<br>
uh, god?</p>

doesn’t that mean his knowledge is our will? … doesn’t that mean he controls our actions…?</p>
<p>“Actually God allows evil, god allows everything, the reason why he created us was to worship him or something like that no really sure”<br>
That doesn’t make sense. Is evil a test? God could have most certainly created a world without it - and, according to the bible, he did! Adam/Eve. If I recall correctly, he punishes the two for eating an apple, but the reason for eating the apple was triggered by the appearance of the serpent… which had to have been created by god. If god knew history and what is to come, doesn’t that mean he could have stopped the serpent/eve? Why didn’t he? So is god just an asshole that likes to test people and send them into damnation for not obeying his orders?</p>

From what I’ve heard, God created everything and knows everything past, present and future. He clearly knew the fate of Satan. You seem to have dodged the question: why does God need ‘our’ help to defeat Satan (assuming God &gt; Satan)? It tale reads as a tug between the two (equality).</p>
