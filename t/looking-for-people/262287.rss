    <title>Looking for people</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-people/262287</link>
    <description>I&#39;m basically looking for people to do Video tutorials in a variety of computing areas. Depending on the area and how good they are, will also depend on payment which would be between 0.50 - 1$ per minute of video produced + other bonuses i.e a money bonuses after 5 have been completed.

I&#39;m basically going to be restarting a tutorial/resource based site. Originally (for those that remember) rs-resources was set up to teach people how to make bots etc...But i started updating and releasing Aryan for free because i thought it stupid Mr Snellman was charging.

Sean greasley was always popular with beginners but 
1. He never does anything new.
2. He doesn&#39;t really seem to know what he&#39;s doing anyway.
3. There&#39;s no community, forums or anything like that for support and help.

Topics would include:
Html and Webdesign.
C++
Java script
Graphics
SQL
Other computer science topics(Not necessarily programming), if you have any idea&#39;s then feel free to share.

Each video would ideally need to be between 3 minutes and 10 mins.

If interested reply/pm me. And only people who have a decent amount of experience in their field.

Cheers</description>

Everyone learn different, I like video tuts and much better than reading boring text, but you need to be able to skip the boring repetitive part as you mention(If it is made good you don’t even need to skip anything).</p>

<p>You can always use a voice changer or synthetic (but naturalish) voice program. With the later however it would require a lot more un-needed effort.</p>

Having something taught to you i find is much easier. Like learning things like Advanced maths from books can be tricky, especially if they don’t give you examples.<br>

<p>Video tutorials and someone teaching you are completely different. A teacher can see on your face whether you understand it or not, and he/she can change the level to your needs. It’s dynamical teaching. A video tutorial is the same as a book: Statical.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve struggled to understand teaching by my teachers. Maths for example, however having signed up for <a href="http://www.livemaths.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">www.livemaths.co.uk</a> which provide video tutorials on maths, i’ve excelled and ended up receiving an A in maths and an A in further maths which enables me into a top university in the country.</p>
