    <title>RS2 Nomination/Server Helper Nomination</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs2-nomination-server-helper-nomination/444741</link>
    <description>I normally wouldn&#39;t nominate anybody on here but there is one person that has always somewhat stood out to me. This person has always been a  good helper in server help, always staying active and looking for updates in the developments that are currently going on, and while he may not be the best programmer out there he has earned a well deserved and respected spot in the community I personally believe and feel.

If I was to be asked &quot;who I would nominate either for either one of those awards to&quot; I would choose Mr. Extremez wholeheartedly and without hesitation. 

(Also, I request for this to stay private if possible to be asked )</description>
