    <title>Does running a private server open up my computer to attack?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-running-a-private-server-open-up-my-computer-to-attack/403319</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve hosted private servers before, but on my own computer. My computer recently broke and I want to use the computer the whole family uses to host a server, but my dad says running a server opens up my computer to attack because of the open ports you need. Could anyone please explain to me if running a private server is safe or not? If it isn&#39;t safe to run one, could you please explain to me exactly why it is not safe so I can understand a bit more; and if it is, could you please explain why also?              Thanks in advance.</description>

I wouldnt worry to much bout ports,i would worry about getting ddosed if u dont have no-ip and u just put you’re ip into client.java, really nothing to worry about if you’re a dick people might ddos you but otherwise no.<br>
[/quote]You can get people’s IP using their No-IP dynamic address.[/quote]<br>
You can get there ip adresss if you put it in instead of no-ip.biz example server = (“99.245.124.56”) there go into client then look for client.java then its there.</p>
