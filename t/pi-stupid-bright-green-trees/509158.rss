    <title>[PI] Stupid bright green tree&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-stupid-bright-green-trees/509158</link>
    <description>So, i&#39;m trying to fix the tree&#39;s because half the tree&#39;s look normal &amp; the other half are pretty much lime green &amp; i checked everywhere on how to fix it &amp; it say&#39;s to delete 1570.dat from the raw folder, which i dont have so i used tom&#39;s cache editor &amp; found 1570 but you cant delete it; So i tried to replace it with a working tree model, &amp; i still have the stupid lime green tree&#39;s. 

Basically, is there a way for me to get rid of these dumb lime green tree&#39;s because i&#39;ve looked everywhere &amp; i am honestly 100% clueless.

-This is probably posted in the wrong spot but i honestly don&#39;t know exactally where to post this because i&#39;ve never had to really mess with cache.</description>

              <p>Isn’t there a way to decompress the models.dat &amp; models.idx?</p>
<p>Also, what do you use to compress the models into the .dat&amp;.idx extension?<br>
i looked around and was not sure if i found the correct one’s…</p>

              <p>You probably have a compressed model.dat file, now what you can try, is get a 317 pi cache (which is already quite extended) and add the model to that Raw folder and then compress those models into 1 model.dat file and just replace it (make a backup of it though before you decide to erase it!)</p>
