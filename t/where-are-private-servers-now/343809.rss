    <title>Where are private servers now?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-are-private-servers-now/343809</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got quite a few questions and I really don&#39;t know where to start answering them myself, So I&#39;m hoping that I could get some help getting educated on how far private servers have come since I was last involved.. 

So here is a question.. 

Alright I&#39;ve noticed alot of 500+ server threads.. such as 508 and so on.. Honestly I really lost all interest in the whole private server world long before these DeltaScape was even released.. so as you could imagine I&#39;m REALLY far behind on things, Though, I have tinkered with Delta on a few occasions but never really got into it, So could someone fill me in on what all has happened with servers since the old 317&#39;s?</description>

<p>youre right for the most part.<br>
the updated varrock didnt come until like 474, not 435, ive looked at 455 maps and the varrock floormap is almost identical to the 317.<br>
i thought soul wars came after the new sideicon update? (the new sideicons came after like 544)<br>
new magic icons came after the new sideicons, so 530 is a little early.[/quote]</p>
<p>530 was the new magic icons, I’m pretty sure Luke132’s server contained them. It’s either that - or the hide buttons.</p>
<p>Varrock update came out as 462, I remember the post on R-S</p>

<p>Well, the highest revision RSPS is working with (And actually getting anywhere) is a 601, which is the first stable client base since RuneScape’s new skill came out. Since the 317 era there have been a few popular revisions to build off of, 459, 474, 503, 508, 525, 554, 582, and 601. Each of those client revisions mark the start of something special in RSPS.

<p>There are also lower revision clients that load higher revision caches. (508 loading 525, 601 loading 602). The most popular higher revision base remains to be the 508(IMO).<br>

<p>Isn’t 484 summoning? 503 is summoning update 2.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Could be, Idk.[/quote]Ye, summoning came out before the new graphics, which was 503.</p>
<p>Also, private servers since the “old” 317’s have gotten less and less original. Most of them either have the same content or same idea. Rarely do I see a new minigame or idea implemented in a private server today. No on wants to take the time to make a decent server anymore. It’s all about releasing, releasing, releasing, and they all suck. And if they don’t suck, they’re most likely being hosted for money.</p>

              <p>[quote=“LegionOfDoom, post:2, topic:343809”]Delta is what happened. When something new comes out, people rush to it. They’d rather have the coolest up to date server out there, that they can barely understand, rather than have a server where they understand every part of its protocal. Basically people want to be spoon fed. They’d rather have a 508+ server where everything is added, rather then some 317-474 where they acctually have to do work.</p>

<p>True… But then again that’s always been true…</p>
<p>Although this doesn’t really answer the question at hand I appreciate your input</p>

              <p>I’ve got quite a few questions and I really don’t know where to start answering them myself, So I’m hoping that I could get some help getting educated on how far private servers have come since I was last involved…</p>
<p>So here is a question…</p>
<p>Alright I’ve noticed alot of 500+ server threads… such as 508 and so on… Honestly I really lost all interest in the whole private server world long before these DeltaScape was even released… so as you could imagine I’m REALLY far behind on things, Though, I have tinkered with Delta on a few occasions but never really got into it, So could someone fill me in on what all has happened with servers since the old 317’s?</p>
