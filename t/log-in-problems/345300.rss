    <description>Ok so i started a 562 server. Everythings up i checked server status it says online. i even got client. So i made myself owner and edited everything i wanted and logged in (localhost). once i did all that i remembered that only i could log in b/c i was using local host. so i edited the client to put in my server ip and it says error connecting to server even though its up? i changed everything in source files and client files to my server ip. still nothing. it only lets me log in as localhost but my server is online? what did i do wrong or what did i forget to do to make it not log in?</description>

<p>to make a “Dynamic ip” go to <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> sign up and make a host. example “<a href="http://runescapeps.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">runescapeps.no-ip.org</a>” that would be a dynamic ip</p>
