    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/plz-help-im-almost-done-with-my-server-d/417282</link>
    <description>hey guys so I followed this tut on how to add castlewars:
http://www.google.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/tutorials/220638-castle-wars-delta.html (replace &quot;Google&quot; with &quot;rune-server&quot;)
everything works really good until I go into the waiting room I wait until it finishes counting and then nothing happens :( it just starts counting down again.

I think its because the code that makes it teleport me to castlewars when it finishes counting down isn&#39;t even written but I&#39;m not sure and i do not have the code and do not know how to make one so please help me out I would be so thankful</description>

<p>what do you mean by that im not a really good coder and i do not understand much :&gt; so if you could give me the codes and where to put them i would be grateful<br>
[/quote] i dont understand did you say that when its done counting down then it teleports you back to castlewars? just change the tele coords to inside castlewars then add the start game in actionmannager.java[/quote]<br>
no i just stay in the waiting room it doesn’t do anything all it does is start counting down all over again <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> and i don’t teleport anywhere</p>
