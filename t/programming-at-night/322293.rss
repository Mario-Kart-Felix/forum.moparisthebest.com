    <title>Programming at night?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/programming-at-night/322293</link>
    <description>Right now it&#39;s 3:01 AM and I&#39;ve been programming like super well this night. I don&#39;t know why, but maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m tired and my mind only thinks about one thing; how to fix the errors or how this method would be built, etc... In the daytime I have other things to think about and I usually also give up on my projects in the daytime. This sums up what I did in like 6 hours this night: (my eyes are hella tired too)

Released blank client
Released 578 deob client (yay4me)
Got 525 working
Got 525 shops working (converted Z508 tutorial to Z525, wasn&#39;t too difficult but it is different...)
Wrote a huge 5 chapter informational java thread

I had more I just can&#39;t think of it right now lol, maybe I&#39;ll remember in the morning.

Have any of you tried this? If not, try it. I think it helps me focus more.

EDIT: Oh wow 4 hrs 53 mins and I just registered at like 9:00 PM o.O</description>

At night is one of my favorite times to do things, because no one is up at my house and I don’t have to worry about interruptions. But, normally I’ll get stuck on a problem and go to bed. The following morning I’ll get up and take a shower and get back to it and be able to fix the problem very easily.<br>

I remmember over the summer when me and you were up all night on msn and i was making <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,381920.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,381920.0.html</a> and you were making your interface maker :P[/quote]That was hell &gt;_&lt; I can’t stand staying up a full night without getting sleep and then continuing the day. Also, I was working on my first useful application in C++ (The Spriting Tool), which never got finished <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Time and time again, through past experiences with coding, I’ve outdone myself during the night. Not even with just programming, but I’ve no-lifed with other projects as well at night. It’s all about focusing and having no interest in anything else, because what else is interesting at that time?</p>

Right now it’s 3:01 AM and I’ve been programming like super well this night. I don’t know why, but maybe it’s because I’m tired and my mind only thinks about one thing; how to fix the errors or how this method would be built, etc… In the daytime I have other things to think about and I usually also give up on my projects in the daytime. This sums up what I did in like 6 hours this night: (my eyes are hella tired too)</p>
<p>Released blank client<br>
Released 578 deob client (yay4me)<br>
Got 525 working<br>
Got 525 shops working (converted Z508 tutorial to Z525, wasn’t too difficult but it is different…)<br>
Wrote a huge 5 chapter informational java thread</p>
<p>I had more I just can’t think of it right now lol, maybe I’ll remember in the morning.</p>
<p>Have any of you tried this? If not, try it. I think it helps me focus more.<br>
[/quote]Tbh you didn’t really work on the deob because it was originally someone elses you just added models etc changed name and deleted .java files etc… anyways good job.[/quote]</p>
<p>Added 377 cache, made it compatible with 317 deob, made moving water (which was easy meh), new emote system, extended emote + graphic list, but w/e</p>
