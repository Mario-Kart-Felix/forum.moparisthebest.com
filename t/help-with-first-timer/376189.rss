<p>Right, i do that but it still doesn’t work for me. This is why i need someone to help me over teamviewer with getting that setup.[/quote]<br>
ok if your environmental variables are correctly set then call you have to do is use an IDE or make this bat file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">@echo off
cd your src dir (delete this line if all of your files are in one folder)
java client
pause</code></pre>
<p>if your compiler bitches about no argument, put this after the “java” part: -Xmx512m</p>
