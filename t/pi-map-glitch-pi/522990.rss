    <title>[Pi] map glitch [Pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-map-glitch-pi/522990</link>
    <description>Everytime I tele to, or get near to Castle Wars, it says loading, then glitches me out. I&#39;m almost certain this is because my server doesn&#39;t have the Castle Wars map (or so I think). My old server had castle wars and they are both 317 old school graphics, can I just take my Castle War map from my old server and add it to this one. If so, which files do I transfer over from my old cache?</description>
