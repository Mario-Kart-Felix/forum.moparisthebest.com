    <description>[b]Since it got removed last time without my consent or informing me of why, I&#39;ll post again. (:[/b]
[size=32pt]IF YOU DOWNLOADED AND RAN THIS, SCAN YOUR COMPUTER NOW![/size]
Moparisthebest even said I can keep it here. Good try though.
Fuck the haters, re-released. If you don&#39;t like it, gtfo.
So, most of you know about FormationX. Don&#39;t say I&#39;m a nub, and just rereleasing for the hell of it.
I actually fixed this all up, all the bugs. Fixed the ugly antidupe it had. Fixed Duel Arena bug, added Duel Arena forfeiting, lowered drop rates to a fixed economy, more I just cbf to explain. MySQL integrated with Highscores (Just insert your MySQL Database info), Vote4CASH,
PlayersOnline image. All that shit. Another thing that&#39;s integrated is Dungeoneering. That&#39;s a secret, not telling you how to access it. If you&#39;re a decent coder, you can find out yourself. Js.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Need staff members, too. Don&#39;t ask.

We are a brand new server in the 317 revision. The game is hosted online 24/7, with no downtime at all (excluding server restarts for our awesome frequent updates!).

Here at HybridzFate, we have extremely friendly and dedicated staff that are very welcoming and are willing to help no matter what the matter is at all! (no trolls though, damnit!) I’ll try to keep the text as simple as possible so that you don’t get bored of reading all of this!

- HybridzFate Features -
- Perfected Webclient, link is above. Still has the 602 items/gfx’s/npc’s!
- VOTE4CASH - reward is 10m! :)
- Perfect XP rate! Not too slow to make you bored, not too fast to make you finish the game quickly! (also leads to boredom, uh ohhh!)
- Frequent Double XP Weekends! On frequent occasions, we have double xp weekends at HybridzFate! Of course, this is pretty much self explanitory!
- Dedicated and friendly staff!
- All RuneScape items from the 634th revision! These all have the correct models, and are 100% working!
- All RuneScape graphics from the 525th revision! These of course are 100% working as well!
- All RuneScape animations from the 602nd revision! As well as the items and graphics, these are also working 100%!
- Working Dragon Claws, with the correct graphics and 4x hit on the special attack! The 4x hit applies to both on players, and on npc’s! This is 100% legitimate!
- Working Godsword Special Attacks! This applies for the Godswords: Bandos, Armadyl, Zamorak, and Saradomin! That’s right, all four godswords!
- Correct Godwars Dungeon (GWD) that features in RuneScape! Verse your favourite GWD Bosses here!
- Working Tormented Demons! These drop a wide range of items! If you’re lucky, you’ll end up with a set of Dragon Claws!
- The classic Corp Beast! Verse one - or if not, the strongest monster ever faced in RuneScape either solo, or with a team! This monster drops items of a great range, such as Spirit Shields!
- Unique home that is extroadinarily easy to adapt to! There are many shops in this area, that sell a wide range of various items to assist you right throughout your journey!
- 23 Skills working and 100% trainable! That’s right, not 20, 23! HybridzFate has the skill known as &quot;Hunter&quot;, and &quot;Summoning&quot;! This works along with the 21 other skills in HybridzFate!
- Extreme potions and overloads that are 100% working!
- Features Minigames - that never get old, due to rapidly being used by other players!
- Warriors Guild
- Duel Arena
- Tzhaar Pits (With Jad!)
- Pest Control (Earn HFP - HybridzFate Points for winning!)
- Full Vengeance and Vengeance Other (Correct GFX’s &amp; Anims)
- 602 GFX’s/Items/NPC’s!
- EVERY Spell in the Regular/Ancient Spell book working! 100% LEGITIMATE!
- Active PK’ers, that counts for pures, zerkers, mains, and all the above!
- Active Skillers! That’s right, we have MANY MANY skillers - so skilling can NEVER get boring and you will never run out of competition!
- Barrows - digging, barrows armor fixing, and you have to find your way to the middle!
- Dagganoth Lairs, with the Dagg Kings, better use your Prayer!
- Full Ancient Prayer Curses - protects even working!
- We’re so good, Jagex can’t even stop us. Join us in the defeat!
- Much, much, MUCH more! See for yourself!

There will be a DOUBLE EXP WEEKEND this weekend - so be sure to check it out![/I]
