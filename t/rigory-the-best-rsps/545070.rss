Hello Rune-Server, this is my server and I am excited to show it to you, I apologize for the thread layout as this is the first time I have touched this advertisement thread in months. I currently run the server with Chinos who goes by Emporio Armani, Kieran from Rswebclients, and Samuel. We have been working on this since october, have rewritten most frameworks, and have added a large amount of content in that time. I mean what can you lose to check it out once?

[B]Public Beta ETA 07.18.14[/B]

The new age is upon us, the future of Runescape private servers is soon to be unveiled and we shall rise amongst the ranks of our competitors, crushing them to claim our title as the number one server. This will be an experience like no other that you have embarked on before, begin your quest to become a legend in our community of players. We invite any patrons to join us in making history and creating a legacy for those to follow. New and Old players will find mutual ground as we accommodate both needs and cater for everything in between.

[B]Time is of the essence, start your journey today…[/B]

Rigory [/B]is a new Runescape Private Server and is growing daily. With a large active community, plentiful updates, and tons of ingame content we assure you that Rigory will be an experience of a lifetime! We invite all players to join us in making history and creating a legacy to last in history. The server has been released over a year ago but since then we have worked on a different source for 10 months that is now known as [B]Rigory[/B], &amp; we&#39;re rapidly growing, which gives us hope that this server will soon become the number one place for Runescape Private Server fans to come and play.[/ADMIN]

[B]Introducing one of the many main attractions, Bloodlust.[/B]

 
Bloodlust is one of the most successful wilderness games on our server. It separates the weak from the strong and its main goal is to showcase those that perform at an exceeded level in the skill of PKing.
 
You create a team or join an existing team of elite players and the main objective is to kill rival teams or individual players to collect points for your own team. The game is run in seasons and at the end of each season the top 3 teams will receive generous rewards. With each new seasons scores are reset and everyone is given the chance to be the best and once again, reap the benefits of the rewards at hand.
 
Rewards for our first season of Bloodlust;
 
1st Place: $750 and an exclusive Bloodlust Cape
2nd Place: Rigory Lucky Bag, Donator tokens and Bloodlust Cape.
3rd Place: Rigory Lucky Bag and Bloodlust Cape.
 
 
With our Development team currently working around the clock to bring the latest updates to the server, what we currently have is only the start of what is to come. An assortment of new updates following up our new client release are currently in motion. Expect to see new updates such as:
 
• Soul Wars
• Clan Wars
• Passives
• Rs07 Autochat Feature
 
And of course, many more…
