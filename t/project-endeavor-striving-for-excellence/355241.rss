Runescape Private Servers have been around since 2005. The first server was almost nothing. You would fly around the Runescape map as an invisible character (hence the nickname &quot;Flight through RuneScape&quot;). We have come along way. But the reality is, servers are always the same thing. Player Killing and a shop economy. Think about all the servers you have played. How many have you actually enjoyed totally? That&#39;s where Endeavor comes in.

I focus on the community more than anything else. This server is targeted at people that enjoy community. It will be an all around fun server. A staff requirement is friendliness, so there&#39;s no need to worry about abuse. This is your server. Support us and suggest to us.

~  The Team  ~

[ul][*]Mikey`
[list]
[*]Main server programmer.
[/list][/ul]


I started this project because I believe Private Servers aren&#39;t going anywhere with only Player Killing servers. 
My server will focus on everything that made the old Runescape enjoyable. Player Killing will be in the server, but it won&#39;t be the main feature.

Also, I&#39;ve noticed in most servers, the Staff members don&#39;t respect their playerss. The Staff of Endeavor has a requirement of Player Respect.


[ul][*][IMG]http://i35.tinypic.com/rcvwye.png[/img]Player Helper
[list]
[*]In order to be a Player Helper you must be an exceptional player in all the categories. You must be helpful, willing to help when asked, nice, good grammar, and you must be active. They help players with in-game features.
[/list]
[*][IMG]http://i33.tinypic.com/2ep7nsz.png[/img]Player Moderator
[list]
[*]Players Moderators must handle all Player Reports and help players whenever possible (besides in-game feature help). They must also be active.
[/list]
[*][IMG]http://i36.tinypic.com/24yvf5y.png[/img]Administrator
[list]
[*]Administrators are only people I have known for a long period of time. If a Moderator has been consistent with their position and have been a good help they may be promoted. Administrators must be friendly, and helpful as much as possible (I cannot stress this enough). They have access to my personal cell-phone numbers in case they urgently need me.
[/list]

[list]
[/list]
[*]Every member of the Staff gets access to features that are still in Beta. By this I mean they get to test features that are not yet available to regular players. After the Beta features are released to the public they will lose anything they gained (if anything) from the feature.[/ul]
