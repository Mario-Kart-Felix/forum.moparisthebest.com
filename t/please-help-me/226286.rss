    <description>hello, i have a D-link WBR 1310 router and i am having trouble portforwarding my server.
i have my no-ip set up, and i allowed the port 43594 to my firewall but it still wont work and its driving me crazy!

please someone help me fill out the port the right way or tell me what im doing wrong

i put moparscape as the application name, made teh traffic type to TCP, and i activated the ports so i dont know what im doing wrong.

p.s i have tried portforward.com, and it doesnt work, and theres no mopar guides for d-link router</description>
