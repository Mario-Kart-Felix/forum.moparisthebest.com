    <description>Hey people, i have recently downloaded a source called dragon-history and i like it so i was wanting to use it and change stuff around but anyways when i try to log in to the server from my webclient, it says login server offline when i have the sever running and i think it has something to do with the specific client to use which is dragon-history client and i dont want to use it because its just the same as my original webclient i have on my website. Just let me put it this way: How do i change it to have my client the specific one to use?

Please help...</description>
