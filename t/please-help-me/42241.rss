              <p>During the late 19th and early 20th century, there were many significant issues facing the working men and women of society at the time. These issues greatly varied - issues regarding the loss of physical ability, disease, and sometimes even death.<br>
Not a lot could be done to prevent this at the time - the businesses were in control, and there were no laws to guide how business was conducted. Because of this lack of government placed control, workers were quite literally “used and abused”. They were underpaid, treated to horrific working conditions, and payed far less then that needed to sustain a family.<br>
Not only this, but inequality was at a large in this era - women were paid a great deal less then men, just because they could be.</p>
<p>However, you may note that it was even worse for children. Children started working very early, many before the age of 10. They were basically forced to; if they didn’t they would probably starve, as the money earnt by parents just couldn’t afford their living costs.<br>
Yes, this era was a dark time for workers.</p>
<p>Try that - however, about the age children started working and so on, that is based on Australian history. Modify what needs to be changed to fit the history of your own country.</p>
