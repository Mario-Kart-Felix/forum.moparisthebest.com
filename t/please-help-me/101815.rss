    <description>Hello Members of the moparscape forum,
    I am currently working on Tribe PK. It is soon to be a massive server, that will over-rate the charts. I have gotten 10/10 feedback from my testers, for what i have done so far. Although, I have 1 problem. I really dont want my server to be in ruins due to this problem. If you can i would like you to see if you can do anything, you are my last resort. I have tried tuts, by myself, and many other thing, and they all have failed. PM me back if you wouldn&#39;t mind helping. I only need experienced coders, reply for access to help!
