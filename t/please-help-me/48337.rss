    <description>Hello, I just heard about moparscape and private servers and I wanna know how to use it. 
 I got a few questions that maybe someone can answer?

1) When I go to www.moparisthebest.com, I see &quot;For the Server Status page click here, For the Forums click here&quot; and I see a black box with nothing in it(surrounded by white). what do I do?

2) How do I play other peoples game or private server thingy?(or does this have to do with my first problem)

please can someone help me?</description>
