    <description>Okay, what i need help with is Adding the new method of withdrawing money (like type in 14m) 
I want to add these: 

-Withdraw mode including &quot;m&quot; for a million, &quot;k&quot; for a thousand.
- Prevent the changepassword command from saving passes with capitals in it.
- Censor for websites. So .com turns into .***

I&#39;d Like to fix the following:

-Market clan chat glitch. (will automatically put you in without you wanting to) 

-Food/Potion Glitch - Sometimes you cannot eat or drink. 1

-Prayer Glitch. (protect item doesn&#39;t work if you have it on and then log off, it will say it&#39;s on but doesn&#39;t work)

Can you please help me or tell me what to do?</description>
