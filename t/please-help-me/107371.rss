    <description>Ok, Iv&#39;e made a server, the only problem is it wont let anyone log in for more then 3 seconds.  When I compile it compiles, when I run it runs.  It only lets me logg in with 1 account, thats all.  When I try to logg in, or when anyone trys to logg in.. it lets them, but then they get disconnected in 3 seconds (literally).  When I try to log on with a different name I get disconnected, and at the bottom of the screen it says &quot;Error: T2 - 246,71,253 - 6,3440,3232 - 120,9,0,-56,-17,-55,&quot; Please someone help me.. who ever helps me fix will become a mod! Thanks!!!!!</description>
