<p>How did posting that help him in any way?</p>
<p>OT:<br>
First things first, Java is Java, no matter what revision or base, so programming a certain revision doesn’t tend to matter.</p>
<p>The reason you haven’t had an answer in this section is because your problems are client related and would be better suited in the client help section, re post this there with a little more backing knowledge to the problem and someone will help you asap.</p>
