    <description>I just bought an iMac G5 Powered Pc version 10.5.8. and I thought it was going to be great but the thing that sucks is i cant really play any games and i cant even play rs classic because they dont make java updates for my version anymore and the latest version of java i have is 5.0 , I know runescape would work on my computer because its fast its just that the newer clients dont support my version.. If anyone knows a server i could try playing on or a solution to this i would appreciate it because i feel really bummed that I waited a week for this thing and it let me down big time. thank you
