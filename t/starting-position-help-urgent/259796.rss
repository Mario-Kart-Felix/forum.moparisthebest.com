    <title>Starting Position Help, Urgent</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-position-help-urgent/259796</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I am making a V2 for my source but I want to change the starting postion! I know how to do this but I can&#39;t log into my server to find the current X and Y starting position! So I was going to ask you if you have your own server, if you could log in and find YOUR current X and Y starting position and then search for it in your client.java and look for like 2 word that are right next to that or around it so I can change mine! The reason why I can&#39;t log into mine is because..You can look at my other post..but I need someone to tell me like 2 words around their current X and Y position so I can search it and find mine. If someone could do that for me that would be GREAT!

Thank you very much
