    <title>Have a Question // Please help :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/have-a-question-please-help/358770</link>
    <description>guys I have downloaded Runeslay 562 source because it had a lot of features like duel arena etc.
But I dont like his commands, shops and the npc&#39;s he has spawned in certain places.
So I have my own source that I have customized alot so I want to move my commands, shops, npc&#39;s from my own source to the runeslay source. And I dont like his home and certain objects he has places. I only like its features but not his shops etc.

So any solutions  :D

I think I have to replace only the packethandler directory  :cool: Am i right?  :confused:</description>
