    <title>Why Doesnt Following Work? How to Fix? [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-doesnt-following-work-how-to-fix-pi/519670</link>
    <description>So when in game, if you press follow someone when there standing still, your character will run up to him and stand behind him just how he would normally, but then once the person starts to move the &quot;follower&quot; just stands there, but he like rotates to look at the guy, like, everything works normally except he doesnt move... any help?
Thanks,
Adam.</description>
