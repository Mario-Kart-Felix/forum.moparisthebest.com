    <description>[center]Hello Mopar,
I am currently looking for a very experienced Java developer who is looking to become a part of the next biggest server. I will say now that I have very, VERY little java knowledge. My role is to oversee the server, make sure everything is running as it should be. YOUR job will be to add constant updates/new content, and also add many of the unique ideas I have for the server.[/center]

[center]The server is going to be a PI based PK&#39;ing server. I have A LOT of very good, and new ideas that will help our server become #1. I will take care of all expenses when I feel that the server is where it should be. If I think you have been doing well, a contract may be discussed.[/center]

[center]The Server:
317 PI
Lost Legacy Source + Client[/center]

[center]If anyone is interested, please contact me via skype at: xerobots
also, leave an application:

Age:
Years of Java Experience:
Previous Work: 

^^^
It is perfectly fine if you are young, or don&#39;t have previous work to show - I am looking for someone who is CURRENTLY skilled.
