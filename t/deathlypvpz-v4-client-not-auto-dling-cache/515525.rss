    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deathlypvpz-v4-client-not-auto-dling-cache/515525</link>
    <description>hey guys,
i have deathlypvpz v4 client and it doesn&#39;t automatically DL the cache anymore because i changed the name on the file .zip
and in signlink.java and also uploaded the cache to uppit and mediafire to see which would work better
and none work...
and the reason i want to upload my cache is because ( i changed the background so i need to upload my 1 which has changed background) so yeah..
but whatever i try it doesn&#39;t work 
how should i make it work?
where should i upload it or something so it accepts the link and auto DL&#39;s
?
thanks alot.</description>
