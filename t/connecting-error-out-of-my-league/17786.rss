    <title>Connecting Error, out of my league</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-error-out-of-my-league/17786</link>
    <description>Well, I had server running buetifully, then, all of a sudden today, everything seems to go haywire, and noone can connect, and I tried Hamachi, and made a network, but yet, noone can connect! I&#39;ve tried forwarding my port through the firewall. It&#39;s out of my league, I got nothing when it comes to IP&#39;s :( If anyone can help me, you must be a genious. This is out of my league! And, my ip on Hamachi is different to the one on www.whatismyip.com

Please, someone help</description>
