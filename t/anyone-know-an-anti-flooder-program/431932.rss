    <title>Anyone know an Anti Flooder program?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-know-an-anti-flooder-program/431932</link>
    <description>Currently I have 1 connection per IP and the nulls have come along.
I&#39;ve heard there is a program to stop nulls, but I can&#39;t find it anywhere.
I&#39;ve had anti null before but when I heard that there was a program I decided to get the 1 connection per ip; since I wasn&#39;t being nulled at the time and I hoped I could find it before I got nulled, long story short; I didn&#39;t.
If anyone can find/has an anti flooder, and will let me use it, thank you.


I&#39;m out</description>

So you believe NULL is a ‘flooder’? I don’t know exactly what a flooder is, but based on the context I believe you think it’s someone committing a malicious act.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that NULL is actually a memory address. You see Java, like other languages, has the ability to allocate memory on the heap rather than the stack. This is what the <span class="bbcode-i">new</span> keyword does in Java, C (malloc), and C++ to name a few. NULL is the memory address of 0, it is reserved for pointers (or references in the case of java) that do not point to any position in memory.</p>
<p>How does this occur? In Java, two ways:</p>
<p>The reference has been manually set to NULL</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Object myObject = null;</code></pre>
<p>Or the memory the reference was pointing to has gone out of scope</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">//...
private void doSomething() {
     Object myObject = new Object();
}
//...</code></pre>
<p>As you can see the scope of myObject is restricted to that method. When the method returns, the object is no longer accessible and garbage collection comes along and cleans up the no longer accessible memory allocation.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I don’t believe null is a flooder. The program being used to spam my server logs players in as “null” over 100 times. It’s rather annoying.[/quote]<br>
If your issue is reoccurring, possibly simultaneous connections from one source I suggest trying to throttle connections. An easy way to do this is to have a map keyed by connecting address (you can use the InetAddress object in Java which you can get from the incoming connection Socket) and have an long as it’s value (the longs value should be the last successful log in timestamp - you can obtain this using System.currentTimeMillis()). When an incoming connection is found, simply making a conditional like the following:<br>
[tt]<br>
If ConnectionMap contains IncomingAddress<br>
If System.currentTimeMillis() - ConnectionMap.get(IncomingAddress) &gt; 3000L //If the last connection is greater than 3 seconds<br>
Allow Connection<br>
Else<br>
Close Connection<br>
Else<br>
Allow Connection[/tt]</p>

              <p>Currently I have 1 connection per IP and the nulls have come along.<br>
I’ve heard there is a program to stop nulls, but I can’t find it anywhere.<br>
I’ve had anti null before but when I heard that there was a program I decided to get the 1 connection per ip; since I wasn’t being nulled at the time and I hoped I could find it before I got nulled, long story short; I didn’t.<br>
If anyone can find/has an anti flooder, and will let me use it, thank you.</p>
<p>I’m out</p>
