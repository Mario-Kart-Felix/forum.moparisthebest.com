    <title>[PI] Ping command so players can check the lag?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-ping-command-so-players-can-check-the-lag/410063</link>
    <description>Does anyone know how or where to get a command like this? I tried googling and got squat. If there isn&#39;t a command like this- how could I write it? If someone could help me I&#39;ll write a tutorial for it, but I really want to boost my java skills by writing my own unique command.

The reason I want this is some people say the server lags, It&#39;d be cool to show them that it&#39;s not the server and it&#39;s the connection between the player. I know there will be some client side stuff to this too, so this will also be posted in the dev and client section.

What can I use to measure the delay in packets? I&#39;m a novice at java, I can learn alot with this.  :D


Thanks,
Gergy
