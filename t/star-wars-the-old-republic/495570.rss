    <title>Star Wars: The Old Republic</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/star-wars-the-old-republic/495570</link>
    <description>Has anyone tried out this game, I created a free account and went online and found that it was VERY interesting  I&#39;ve been playing this game a lot for the past three days and I love it, but it does have its moments where I want to loveing die.


Anyway, the game itself is pretty cool, graphics are decent, story is awesome (depends on class), powers are pretty awesome (depends on class) etc., so has anyone ever heard of it (I&#39;d assume so, there is a lot of advertisements on this site about it)?


The only thing I find a little ridiculous is the membership related stuff but meh... not a big deal.</description>

              <p>Well, I purchased a subscription for the game (180 days subscription), and haven’t had too bad of an experience with it. The only problem is how big the distance is between missions but then again - that’s not a big deal.</p>
<p>I think it doesn’t do too well explaining some aspects but I do find it to still be an interesting sort-of game, and haven’t gotten bored with it so far. I have, however, gotten tired of it at some points because of bosses and stuff - other than that, I don’t have a problem with it.</p>

              <p>I preordered the digital collectors edition, and some really high hopes for the game. When it came out I had a lot of fun with it but then it started to slide away. Plus apparently there is terrible end-game content and when you finish it, it’s gets really boring really fast. So a lot of the hardcore players quit and the game started to die out which is when they interested free to play which everyone hates except the noobs. I’ve quit since then.</p>

              <p>I have watched a few reviews on Youtube, and some of my friends have played it as well.</p>
<p>Not really a good response, after the “F2P” it seems to have turned to a chaotic game <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> . I was actually going to try it out but after criticism the game have recieved, no thanks.<br>
Else I don’t know so much :).</p>
