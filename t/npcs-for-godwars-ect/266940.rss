    <title>Npc&#39;s for godwars, ect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npcs-for-godwars-ect/266940</link>
    <description>I use to be pretty good with the coding, but I left for a while. I&#39;m back and there&#39;s a lot I missed... What the hell is a 508? Seems really dumb to you guys I know, but For now I just want new npc Ids or a link to a tut that involves this. Also maybe A link to a beginner using a 508. If you want to explain a 508 I have no problem.

BTW: Thanks Hellz Scape for not flaming, as I would expect from most of the immature people on this site.</description>
