    <title>[PI] Boolean for in-combat status</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-boolean-for-in-combat-status/515106</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for the boolean that is set to true when the player is in combat. If the player is fighting another player or if the player is fighting another npc, the boolean is true. If the player is not fighting another player or npc, then the boolean is false. There should be something like this in here. Theres a million booleans and integers and I can&#39;t find it. If there isn&#39;t one, please tell me, and tell me a method that I may be able to use to make one.

I know this is an odd question, but I&#39;m making a ::stuck command, and I wouldn&#39;t want someone using the command to avoid dying.</description>
