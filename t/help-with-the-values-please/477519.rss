    <title>Help with the values please</title>

    <description>Hey, i&#39;ve got a little problem here. 
The base is matrix 718 and onwent with panic-pvp. (Matrix 718 tbh)

There&#39;s some things i&#39;d like to have changed. 
Item droppings - how to get it enabled?
Item values - Not shop prices, but the prices when people die in wildy, and which items to keep. how to change those values, as dharok etc. are 800k a piece, and claws are 342k. Dharok keeps over the Claws. - i&#39;ve changed it in shop.java - (added new price loader as prices.java didn&#39;t load correctly), but it still doesn&#39;t change those values from 800k to 200k etc. 
And last thing is i can&#39;t add some items to the shops in my server. i&#39;ve added various items to the shops, but i&#39;m unable to add Dharok gear in the shops. and i&#39;d like to know why, because it frustrates me. it&#39;s loading from some economyprices or something, but nothing with such a name in the source. is it in the cache, and would i need to use a cache editor, to obtain the needed information to do this?

Also - adding Drops to NPC&#39;s - Cache editing, or which .java file? - Do not need to go into details just the basic &quot;overhead&quot; subject.

Thanks in advance.
