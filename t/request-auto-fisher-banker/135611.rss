    <title>[Request] Auto fisher + Banker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-auto-fisher-banker/135611</link>
    <description>I was wondering if someone could make me an auto fisher, to fish lobbies in taverly, then bank them. If you can make it anti-random, so it runs whenever there is a random, also, so it collects the cage if it is taken and thrown by the fish that pops up every once in a while.

Thanks, and good luck.</description>
