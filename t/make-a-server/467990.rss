    <description>In this guide I will include

How to download a Source &amp; Client
How to Run your S&amp;C
How to host your Server
How to put your server online


Part One

Downloading your source and client.

You will need JDK (Up to date) And JRE
You will also need Winrar or 7Zip to extract the files.
All of these can be found on Google


I recomend picking up a nice clean 317 revision Project Insanity Source and Client from the server emulation section on the
moparscape forums. You can get there by searching for it on Google.

Once you have picked a source and client. Download it and extract it to your desktop.

Congratulations. You have a RSPS.


Part Two

Running your source and client

In order to get your server to work, you will need to change the servers IP adress. This can be done by going to

Client&gt;Java&gt;Client.java

Open it up as a notepad file, hit Ctrl+F and search for &quot;Server =&quot;

It will say something along the lines of

&quot;Server =&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;

Or

&quot;Server =&quot;Servername.no-ip.biz&quot;

Replace the no-ip with &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; For now. Save the file.

As this is a java file, you will need to compile it.

Go to Client&gt;Compiler

Right click the windows batch file (Compiler) and select &quot;Edit&quot;

You will see something along the lines of

&quot;@echo off
Title Compiler
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_27\bin\javac.exe&quot; -d ./Class/ Java/*.java Java/sign/*.java
pause&quot;

I will explain the lines of code.

@eco off

Leave that.

Title Compiler

Title is the prefix, you can delete the whole line of code and it will show the path at the top, or edit &quot;Compiler&quot; to 
whatever.

&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_27\bin\javac.exe&quot; -d ./Class/ Java/*.java Java/sign/*.java

&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_27\bin\javac.exe&quot; Is the pathway for your compiler to follow. C Drive, Program Files
Java, then you will need to locate your version of jdk you downloaded, to do this go to
My computer&gt;C Drive&gt;Program files&gt;Java&gt;JDK1.Whatever it says&gt;bin
Click properties on bin and copy the path to get there

Replace &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_27\bin\javac.exe&quot; With your classpath. Leaving javac.exe.

Now run the compiler and your client will run for you.

To do so, go to 

Source&gt;Run

Double click run and let the game engine run

Then go to 

Client&gt;Run

Double Click run and let the client run.

The servers cache should start to autodownload, if it doesn&#39;t, extract the cache from your client file to your C drive.
If your server doesnt come with one, message me or find one yourself.

Now you can play! But, on your own 

Section Three

Hosting your RSPS

NO-IP Is an amazing solution to hosting virtual servers, without this, 99% of Runescape Private Servers wouldnt exist.

Go to your URL bar and type &quot;www.no-ip.com&quot; or search for it in google.

Register on there and go to create host. 

Make a host called something like &quot;yourservername.no-ip.biz&quot;

Then download the specific NO-IP DUC from their website, depending on your OS.

Go back into Client&gt;Java&gt;Client.java hit ctrl+f and search for &quot;server =&quot;

Replace &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; with the host you just created at no-ip.


Section Four

Portforwarding / Putting your server online


This section is opening either port 4359 or 5555. You will need to go to your routers homepage. This stage is specific to 
your router, so unfortunately you&#39;ll have to go to &quot;www.youtube.com&quot; and search for a portforwarding tutorial depending on
your router.

Once this is done, you need to go to &quot;canyouseeme.org&quot; and do the open port check for the port you opened in the 
portforwarding stage.

Once this is all done, save, compile and run your server!

FINNISHED!

Now due to high request I will tell you how to make a webclient.

I sugguest going to the community &quot;www.rswebclients.com&quot;

Register an account there and &quot;Create a client&quot;

Enter your servers name, IP/Host, Port and select a loader. I sugguest ErasedPkz or Project Insanity.

Once this is done, give your players the link &quot;www.rswebclients.com/play/yourservername&quot;

To vote, change &quot;play&quot; to &quot;vote&quot; and your done!
