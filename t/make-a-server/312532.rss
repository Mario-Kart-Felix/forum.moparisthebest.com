    <title>Make a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-a-server/312532</link>
    <description>A lot of people that read this are going to maybe dislike my idea :S
But anyways here what i was thinking

someone should release just a fun staking server and pking

that has many custom rares that not to hard to get but not to easy

with exp rates of like 600x, and many a few rare custom weapons and armor
but that are the same as rune and dragon wep power * and defensive power and what not

but anyways i am sure you sorta no what im getting into :)

If someone could make this happen i think the server
would make it somewheres :) and make some rsc players happy</description>

<p>I was there when Tewl started DDoSing you. He told me to look in your chat box, and once your game went down you told your members to start pinging other servers. You’re nothing but a hypocrite.</p>

              <p>I totally agree with you darscape, I truly don’t get the meaning of ddosing its pointless in my eye’s the reason half<br>
the servers get made is because we now a lot people miss rsc and want to get back into it &amp; a lot of people<br>
are also trying to make servers for us, but then u have the people in it just for money.</p>
<p>But anyways what i am getting to is that ddosing is pointless.</p>

              <p>Yup I agree miles id definitely subscribe or something if that happened. I dont like custom rares or custom armour but I think a good pking and staking server is needed. perhaps another control panel one</p>

              <p>IMO; xEnt, Stork, and someone with a lot of money - should all hook up and make the best pking server that’s as close to RSC as possible. I’m sick of PKing on all these servers that are just fucked. The combat system is a big problem in almost every server, then the random walkbacks/lagg. It’s getting ridiculousssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss</p>
<p>P.S. - DO IT</p>
