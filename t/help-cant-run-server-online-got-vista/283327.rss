    <description>Um well i got a server and it all works has no problems and use to run it 2 years ago. Now i have vista and i dont know what i am doing wrong.
I think it has to do with CLASSPATH and PATH. i have the new java 6 update 14 jdk. If you could tell me exactly what to put in classpath and path and also tell me how to know if i am doing it wrong. thanks[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 11, 2009, 06:11:28 pm[/size][hr]also is it tcp or udp or both in my router Dlink in virtual server</description>
