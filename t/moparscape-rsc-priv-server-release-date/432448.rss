    <title>Moparscape rsc priv server release date</title>

    <description>All,

I am not quite sure who I should be addressing here, however it would be nice for the appropriate person to come forward and answer my questions.

Firstly, I am not sure if people are aware but many of the RSC community are eagerly awaiting the release of Moparscape RSC server. Secondly, RSC community desperately needs a decent server.

I do not think it is fair to continue with this stance of, &quot; the server will be up when it is bug free etc&quot;

There will be bugs with the server, like any other, but surely we can get on it and start leveling that 2x XP!!!

All I ask for is a release date, I don&#39;t think, as a dedicated RSC player, that is too much to ask!

Please help
