    <title>Looking to macro a browser game (not RS)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-macro-a-browser-game-not-rs/361455</link>
    <description>I think this makes me the first poster in this section :)

I understand from looking at the launch thread by Mopar that Simba was not designed for macroing on any specific website.

I am looking to automate some mundane tasks in a browser-game that I play.  It&#39;s basically a grid of tiles that you navigate on, textboxes to fill in, buttons to click... also some images will need to be identified in the script.  Step #1 for me, I suppose, would be to open the webpage in a window that is already targetted by the script, kinda like how SMART could open on its own for Runescape as the targetted window and run while minimized.

I&#39;ve been trying SCAR but I can&#39;t get the webpage to open as the targetted window.  I want to let the script open the webpage while I am away from the computer, and I also intend to base coordinates of textboxes in known locations off the top left of the window.  Is Simba an option for me?

I should say, I have limited programming knowledge outside some C++ programs that ran in a command prompt.  Terms like API are greek to me, so I can&#39;t program a library of includes from scratch.</description>

              <p>Thanks for the prompt response Mopar <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Am I correct that SetupSRL sets SCAR’s target to SMART using SetTargetDC, and that is what enables it to function when it’s minimized, off screen, etc?</p>
<p><code>  Writeln('SMART Initialized.' + #10 + 'Loaded: Server ' + IntToStr(Smart_Server) + ', Members: ' + BoolToStr(Smart_Members)
                 + ', Signed: ' + BoolToStr(Smart_Signed) + ', Super Detail: ' + BoolToStr(Smart_SuperDetail) + '.');
  SmartSetupEx(Smart_Server, Smart_Members, Smart_Signed, Smart_SuperDetail);
  SetTargetDC(SmartGetDC);</code></p>
<p>I did notice when trying to force SmartSetup to launch the website, that SMART will not initialize without the target having an applet declaration, so I see what you mean that it would require modifying.  I don’t even see the source files for that… probably couldn’t do it even if I found them lol.</p>
<p>I would like to let this script launch the game, perform actions, and close it autonomously while I am either 1) away or 2) doing something else.  Thus just opening and autoing normally is not a solution for me yet.</p>
<p>I guess the best option now is to write a script that would launch the program in my normal browser.  However, I have not yet figured out how to pass that handle to SetTargerDC so that the coordinates reference the top left of the browser window.  I’m also not sure this would let it run in the background, like SMART does with the red dot as a mouse.</p>
<p>I downloaded Simba, and it looks like I see a library of functions with very similar to SRL.  However, OpenWebPage() is a procedure.  While InitializeHTTPClient appears to return a handle (not sure, it’s an int), I tried that and it didn’t open a web page.</p>
<p>So my question now becomes: how can I write the script to open a browser and target its window?  And will that let it run on its own, similar to SMART?</p>

              <p>Simba would definitely work, but SMART isn’t going to work without modifications and not at all unless your game is a java applet.  You can just open the page in a web browser and auto normally, but you won’t be able to do anything else on the computer while the script is running.  All you need to program for a simple game like that is probably some findColor()s and moveMouse()</p>
