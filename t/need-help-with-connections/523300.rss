    <title>Need help with connections</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-connections/523300</link>
    <description>Before you say I need to port forward, I&#39;ve done that and tested it. My 718 client + source works fine, but I want to use a 667 source. So when I go to connect using the client with 127.0.0.1 on my hosting computer, doesn&#39;t work, I try using my no-ip IP on a different computer, still doesn&#39;t work. I had this problem with 718 but I had to change the sub_revisions or something like that (I did it awhile ago) but I can&#39;t find out how to do it in 667. All help is appreciated :)
No hate pls.</description>
