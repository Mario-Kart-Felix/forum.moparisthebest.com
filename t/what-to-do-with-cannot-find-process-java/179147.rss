    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-to-do-with-cannot-find-process-java/179147</link>
    <description>This is getting very frustrating and everything is working perfectly HOPEFULLY except my voule restarter. It is saying cannot find process java during restarts. How can I fix this. I am using jdk6u2 and did the classpath and the paths. My compiler is working fine, my runserver is working fine, what am I doing wrong......?</description>
