    <description> I need help with my private server(it is not yet released to public,I am testing it.)I have 2 questions.The first one is:
When I am on my server,every 30mins,it logs me out,then says error connecting to server,or some crap like that.I then have to close run.bat and re open.I think it might be an auto thingy,I don&#39;t know how to get rid of it.

The second one is:
When I log out and log back in,I have 10/40 hitpoints.But before I logged out it was 40/40.Does anyone know how to fix this.By the way,my source is DemonScape,its pretty cool source.

PS:If this post breaks any rules,please lock it.If it is in the wrong section,please move it. ;)

Edit:I have another question.Whenever someone exits tut island,they get level 16attack,strength,and deffence,and 30something hp.Is there anything I can do about it?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 26, 2008, 04:55:27 pm[/size][hr]Help,anyone?</description>
