    <description>Welcome To MachosRealm     

You ask yourself, why should I join MachosRealm? What are the benefits? What features do they have? The answer is quite simple.

        Over the past few years, I have gone from server to server, game to game, playing the same thing, so I ask myself, why isn&#39;t there a unique server unlike anyone else&#39;s server? This question boggled in my mind for a while until I realized what my answer was. The answer was to make my own server, MachosRealm.

        MachosRealm is a server created and maintained by me, MachoNachos. Over the past few years, I have been in many staff positions on a variety or servers, which eventually died due to lack of players, which was created by the minimal effort from said server&#39;s owner, the limited amount of uniqueness, and the minimal amount of creativity and originality. These staff positions gave me knowledge that is helping me now to maintain and support MachosRealm. MachosRealm has many features that most servers dont own. Besides In-game content, we have many other features, both forum and just plainly overall features including our staff team, who monitors the server, and our advertising team. Both teams do an amazing job and maybe, you can join them one day.
        
A list of features regarding MachosRealm are listed below:D
