    <title>Help with getting webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-getting-webclient/507930</link>
    <description>Hi! I need help with getting a client (impozzes client) into a web-client, I have already tried jarring and signing and I can never get it to work. This has been over the spam of 2 years of messing around with rsps&#39;s and what not, I also need help with getting the code the web-client once I have the .jar file for it I think? So I can put on it on the website! Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</description>
