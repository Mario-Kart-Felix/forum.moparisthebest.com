  ohh lol thxxxx:)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Apple tries their best to make their products as simplistic as they could. Yet, there are many people that still find them incredibly complex.

Not only does Apple try and make their products simplistic design-wise, but also the software as well.

How can people still find them difficult to use?</description>

              <p>I was used to drag and drop on my previous mp3 player, and I must say that I got irritated the first time I used iTunes. I was in a hurry, and when I am in a hurry I get pissed off quite easily resulting in me fucking up completely. I even posted a thread here to ask how to use it. After a while I got some music on it, but the next day when I sat in the bus I found out I deleted everything again.</p>
<p>That was the longest bus ride ever.</p>

My brother got an ipod shuffle recently and he had quite a bit of trouble putting songs on it, I wouldn’t say it’s complicated, I’d just say it’s silly needing to install itunes, put desired music into the itunes library then sync it with an ipid. On every non-apple mp3 player I’ve had, it’s just open it &gt; drag music over.<br>
[/quote]Yeah, proprietary stuff sucks dicks.[/quote]</p>
<p>Exactly.   They are very hard to use if you don’t want to use iTunes, and many people don’t.</p>
