    <description>ok i want to change the drops of a armadyl gs to 10% how can i do that? it is dropped by kree araa, its a 508 source with espeon.

where is the shop edit file??because i downloaded this 508 source espeon i want to change the items sold in the shops.

can someone tell me how to add ::xteleall ::xteletome ::xteleto ::ipban ::mute ::jail ::unmute ::unjail ::unban because this server is really good coded with correct monsters and drops but the bad thing is the commands. 

Can someone add my msn lordofd93@hotmail.com because i need a person that knows how to host servers like a 508 espeon source, i tryed using a guide followed direct instructions nothing worked my router is linkys WRT54G V3 the modum i use is Speedstream. giving 20$ for a good helper to teach me how to host the server. You will have accsess to my computer with team viewer so you can see what is wrong.</description>
