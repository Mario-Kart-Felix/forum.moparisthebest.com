              <p>I just did a very simalr thing to what you have done I have moved on from a 317 to a 508 the reson you can’t find any of these files is because the don’t exsist. It  is <span class="bbcode-b">COMPLEATLY</span> differant from a 317 here is a small tut that will probably help you. <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,422427.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,422427.0.html</a></p>
<p>I havn’t gotten very far into 508’s yet its like restarting all over again. Basicly all I have done is changed some names <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">  But a big problem for me was the jdk version. I know it souds dumb but hopefully im saving you time. when you try to compile it will probably say " can not find the path specified…" just edit all the windows batch files to your jdk version <code>@echo off
Title Edgevillepk Compiler
cd ..
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20\bin\javac.exe" -cp . -d ./Bin/ ./Bulby/./io/*.java
pause</code><br>
this is what you will see when you edit. were it says \jdk1.6.0_20\ just swich the 20 to what ever java jdk version you have.</p>
