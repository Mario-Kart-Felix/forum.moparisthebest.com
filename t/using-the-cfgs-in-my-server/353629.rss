    <title>Using the .cfg&#39;s in my server...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/using-the-cfgs-in-my-server/353629</link>
    <description>Okayyyyy, so I&#39;m using Winterlove v3 as a source, and it is completely bare, except for a few custom commands of mine.  I&#39;m new to server development, and I cannot figure out how to load autospawn and the other cfgs into my server.  I&#39;ve looked around, but nothing has helped.  I have all the files in a folder called CFG, and in one of the files, NPCHandler.java, there is this code:

[code=java]NPCHandler() {
		for(int i = 0; i &lt; maxNPCs; i++) {
			npcs[i] = null;
		}
		for(int i = 0; i &lt; maxListedNPCs; i++) {
			NpcList[i] = null;
		}
		loadNPCList(&quot;npc.cfg&quot;);
		loadAutoSpawn(&quot;autospawn.cfg&quot;);
	}[/code]

I would think that would work, but it just...doesn&#39;t.

I may have missed something in the forums here, so it would be great if someone could push me in the right direction.
