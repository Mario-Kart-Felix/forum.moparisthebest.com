[b]Base[/b]: WinterLove

[b]Introduction[/b]
SabsabiOnline is going back into time, back to when MoparScape Servers, SilabSoft servers and so on was popular, when Frugooscape ruled the RSPS empire, but with huge improvements, better performance and so on. I&#39;m simply fed up with the now-a-days servers, I haven&#39;t played private servers for over two years, since DeltaScape came out I stopped playing, I only ran servers from there on, because I&#39;m fed up with that servers &#39;has&#39; to be more and more RuneScapeish, back in the days servers were not here because RuneScape removed wilderness, that was some dumbass who made that up, they were made so that people wouldn&#39;t have to train and so that you could get any items you wanted to.

Yes, I do believe that we should have something like this in development. Hasn’t Sabsabionline came back for like the 11Th time or something, I don’t quite like owners who quit and come, quit and come, quit and come. Nevertheless, good luck with the development mate.<br>

I admit that I am terrible at running a server by myself, due to economic reasons, I’m simply terrible when it comes to spending money the right way, therefore Momo is helping me with the economy part this time like he used to.</p>
<p>However when it comes to gaining members and traffic, that’s what I’m good at. SabsabiOnline has been online for about 3 months now, ran by Momo himself, and he has gained absolutely no traffic.<br>

Trust me, I can tell that it will take two for Sabsabi because I know what your greater pros are in creating a successful server, and Momo’s.</p>
<p>You changed at all as far as the temper with the member’s and what not? Even though half of the member’s when I joined were complete ignorant morons, which I can understand but still haha…[/quote]</p>
