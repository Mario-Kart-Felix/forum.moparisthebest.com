    <description>Was wondering if any java developers would be interested in working on a 2006 based remake private server. I have the funds to pay for the website, vps ect and other essential needs but unfortunately I am not a java developer. I will be providing community management while providing a bridge between players and the developers. I would be looking for one to two server developers and one client developer. All positions will be paid if requested (Will not be paying for mediocre work, if you prove to be a substantial programmer you will be well compensated.). If interested please shoot me a pm or post below.

Examples of things server developers will be expected to do.
Fix all player reported bugs
Add quests
Minigames
Bosses
