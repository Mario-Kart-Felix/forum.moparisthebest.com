    <title>Recalling a pet&#39;s owner after owner has logged out</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/recalling-a-pets-owner-after-owner-has-logged-out/535058</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to think of a way to allow the server to recall what the npc&#39;s owner was before it gets destroyed upon logout. Any ideas?

Npc class contains this method:

[code]public void setFollowing(final Player player, final int radius) {
		if (isFollowing()) {
			resetFollowing();
		}
		following = player; //pet system
		npcFollowEvent = new DelayedEvent(null, 500) {
			public void run() {
				if (player.isRemoved()) {
					resetFollowing();
                                        System.out.println(following + &quot;&#39;s &quot; + Npc.this + &quot; has been returned to the crystal.&quot;);
                                        unblock();
                                        world.unregisterNpc(Npc.this);
                                        remove();
                                        player.getInventory().remove(new InvItem(1231, 1));
                                        player.getActionSender().sendInventory();
                                        player.getInventory().add(new InvItem(1222, 1));
                                        player.getActionSender().sendInventory();
                                } else if (!Npc.this.withinRange(player) &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - player.getLastMoved() &gt; 1000) {
				        Npc.this.teleport(player.getX(), player.getY(), false);
                                        System.out.println(following + &quot;&#39;s &quot; + Npc.this + &quot; has been teleported&quot;);
                                        Npc.this.resetPath();
                                } else if (Npc.this.isBusy()) {
                                        Npc.this.resetPath();
                                } else if (!Npc.this.finishedPath() &amp;&amp; Npc.this.withinRange(player, radius)) {
					Npc.this.resetPath();
				} else if (Npc.this.finishedPath() &amp;&amp; !Npc.this.withinRange(player, radius + 1)) {
					Npc.this.setPath(new Path(Npc.this.getX(), Npc.this.getY(), player.getX(), player.getY()));
				}
			}
		};
		World.getWorld().getDelayedEventHandler().add(npcFollowEvent);
	}[/code]


Resut:

[Player:Marwolf]&#39;s [NPC:Baby Blue Dragon] has been teleported
null&#39;s [NPC:Baby Blue Dragon] has been returned to the crystal.


I need it to remember that the owner was Player:Marwolf instead of null.

On the topic of replacing [NPC:Baby Blue Dragon] with a cleaned string of just &quot;baby blue dragon&quot;, is the only option to set up cases where it checks if npc.this = [NPC:Baby Blue Dragon] then set npcname = &quot;baby blue dragon&quot; or is there a cleaner way of doing text replacement?</description>

<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>I know it would be much better to move all of the code into the Pet class and use event listeners instead. Unfortunately, I am not yet sure how to do write the constructors needed to call non-static methods from other classes, such as setFollowing. I created the InvUseOnNpcListener class as that was missing, based off the InvUseOnObjectListener, InvUseOnItemListener, and InvActionListener classes but my attempt to just call the PlayerLoginListener seems not to be functioning for replacing any empty pet crystal items that were not changed to full pet crystal items when the player logged out. (public void onPlayerLogin(Player player { - which is listed at the end of the Pet class) I find that having a back up way of replacing empty items is needed because the server only seems to cycle through the first 6 or 7 items before the player gets destroyed on logout, leaving the rest of the pet crystal items still empty.</p>
<p>InvUseOnNpcListener just has</p>
<p>[code]public interface InvUseOnNpcListener {</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * Called when a user uses an inventory item on a npc
 */
public void onInvUseOnNPC(Npc npc, InvItem item, Player player);
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>PlayerLoginListener has</p>
<p><code>public interface PlayerLoginListener {
	/**
	 * Called when player logins
	 */
	public void onPlayerLogin(Player player);
}</code></p>
<p>Eventually, I would also want to put the different pet IDs into an array. Still looking to allow the player to use a command to set the pet as following or roaming, as well as attackable or passive. Eventually, making the pet able to fight another Npc would be great, as well as issuing minimap path commands for the pet to follow. It would then be easy to set up a GUI for the pet commands.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Keep in mind that the Player object is no longer referenced to the actual player after it’s destroyed. Saving the players name as a string to the Npc won’t help in this case either, because this npc is also getting removed after player is. So both stop existing if player logs out. And even if you kept the Npc followers in memory some way when server is restarted those pets would be gone. There are ways to make this approach work properly of course but even considering using this approach is stupid.</p>
<p>The best way of doing this is to check for pet follower in destroy method and then remove the Npc and then add the Npc pet item to the players inventory.</p>
<p>EDIT: You do have the following npc reference stored in Player class right?</p>

              <p>I’m trying to think of a way to allow the server to recall what the npc’s owner was before it gets destroyed upon logout. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Npc class contains this method:</p>
<p><code>public void setFollowing(final Player player, final int radius) {
		if (isFollowing()) {
			resetFollowing();
		}
		following = player; //pet system
		npcFollowEvent = new DelayedEvent(null, 500) {
			public void run() {
				if (player.isRemoved()) {
					resetFollowing();
                                        System.out.println(following + "'s " + Npc.this + " has been returned to the crystal.");
                                        unblock();
                                        world.unregisterNpc(Npc.this);
                                        remove();
                                        player.getInventory().remove(new InvItem(1231, 1));
                                        player.getActionSender().sendInventory();
                                        player.getInventory().add(new InvItem(1222, 1));
                                        player.getActionSender().sendInventory();
                                } else if (!Npc.this.withinRange(player) &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - player.getLastMoved() &gt; 1000) {
				        Npc.this.teleport(player.getX(), player.getY(), false);
                                        System.out.println(following + "'s " + Npc.this + " has been teleported");
                                        Npc.this.resetPath();
                                } else if (Npc.this.isBusy()) {
                                        Npc.this.resetPath();
                                } else if (!Npc.this.finishedPath() &amp;&amp; Npc.this.withinRange(player, radius)) {
					Npc.this.resetPath();
				} else if (Npc.this.finishedPath() &amp;&amp; !Npc.this.withinRange(player, radius + 1)) {
					Npc.this.setPath(new Path(Npc.this.getX(), Npc.this.getY(), player.getX(), player.getY()));
				}
			}
		};
		World.getWorld().getDelayedEventHandler().add(npcFollowEvent);
	}</code></p>
<p>Resut:</p>
<p>[Player:Marwolf]'s [NPC:Baby Blue Dragon] has been teleported<br>
null’s [NPC:Baby Blue Dragon] has been returned to the crystal.</p>
<p>I need it to remember that the owner was Player:Marwolf instead of null.</p>
<p>On the topic of replacing [NPC:Baby Blue Dragon] with a cleaned string of just “baby blue dragon”, is the only option to set up cases where it checks if npc.this = [NPC:Baby Blue Dragon] then set npcname = “baby blue dragon” or is there a cleaner way of doing text replacement?</p>
