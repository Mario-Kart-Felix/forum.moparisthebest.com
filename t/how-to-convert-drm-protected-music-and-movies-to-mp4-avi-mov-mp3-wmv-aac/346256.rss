    <description>Many people ask me the same question: &quot;I purchased videos on iTunes, but I can&#39;t play them on my video player, because they are in some &#39;protected&#39; M4V format that only works on iPods. How can I convert iTunes videos to MPEG or WMV format so that I can play them on My portable video device such as Archos and Creative Zen?&quot;

I searched on Google, Yahoo answers and post the question on large number of forums, unfortunately, after scouring the Web for days, I couldn&#39;t find a FREE way to convert M4V to MPEG, WMV or AVI format.

Then I tried to burn the iTunes video onto a DVD and re-import it into iTunes just like how to remove the protection from the iTunes audios (M4P) by burning it onto a CD and re-import it as mp3. I failed, because iTunes doesnt have a DVD burning option, then I used Nero, but it still doesnt work as Nero doesnt supports M4V format. 

And finally, a software solution. I came across a few kinds of converters on Google search, they are Tunebite, Daniusoft and Noteburner. When I was testing the free trials one by one, what makes me comfortable is the Daniusoft media converter .
