Some Good Features i remember when i was playing this server :
-Fully working jad which drops f cape&#39;s!
-G.e Home
-Crabs Training
-Lots of peoples
-Amazing website
-Friendly People&#39;s
-All kind of bosse&#39;s
-Amazing Pvp Area&#39;s and Combat system.
-I think all weapons had 100% working special attack.
-It Was F*cking Nice Server.

              <p>I’m not trying to be rude, however, we don’t need another re-release of this particular server. If you would’ve searched, you most likely would have come across a few re-releases already, such as <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=514967.0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this one</a>, <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=461134.0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this one</a>, and last but not least, <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=449883.0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this one</a>. The only thing(s) that should be re-released (IMO) are the servers that have broken links on the original thread. As you can see, some people disagree because we have 3 releases of the exact same (shitty) server.</p>
