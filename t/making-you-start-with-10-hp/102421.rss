    <title>Making you start with 10 HP?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-you-start-with-10-hp/102421</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a Phonescape source, and my characters seem to start with 99 HP, no matter what I change it to. If I set my character&#39;s HP to 10 with about 1000 XP, it sets it straight back to 99 with 14m xp when I log in.

The only source I&#39;ve seen with 10 HP is maybe Satan&#39;s Isle. Can anyone help me with making you start with just 10 HP? I&#39;m okay about training it.

Thanks :)</description>
