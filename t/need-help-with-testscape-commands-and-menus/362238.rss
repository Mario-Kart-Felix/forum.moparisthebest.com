    <title>Need Help With Testscape Commands And Menus</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-testscape-commands-and-menus/362238</link>
    <description>Ok here basically what my situation is:

Base Server: cheezscape
forum: *advertising is not allowed*
me: darkbb
what i need: a way to customize my server in a way that i can completely control what is happening and the server will not freak when i do something...

specifics: i need to change everything that says cheezscape into roidscape on like the main menus and everywhere that it says all that stuff...i was thinking this would be right next to the custom commands spot but i have looked and looked and i cant find custom commands or anything like them anywhere

SOMEONE THAT IS FAMILIAR WITH CHEEZSCAPE PLEASE HELP ME.

EDIT: also i need a better save game handler if anyone has a more reliable one.</description>
