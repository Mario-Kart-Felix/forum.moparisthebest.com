    <description>After reading Lethal Snow&#39;s introduction topic, i realised some people are not happy with the current situation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This community always has been and always will be fucked up, as Kane said, it&#39;s why we love it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I took this quote from King Redrum. I don&#39;t know if you guys love the way it is , but as Kane said, this community is fucked up.

Anyway, i remember back when kaitniek&#39;s site was still up and running. I really don&#39;t remember much of it, but i do remember i loved the section where people posted ways to change the client so your character could turn into an evil tree. I think the people back then were realy nice.

Then kaitnieks shut down and a message saying the site would soon be back appeared.
That&#39;s when i found MITB.
I remember lots of SCAR scripts were posted here, people worked on various projects and this guy(i dont remember his name) made some serious money by selling SCAR scripts.

By telling this i hope you guys would remember at how good it was back then and that maybe we could change to how it was.
But how? Well, i figured that most people just post random stuff or spam, flame just because they are bored.
We should all work on a project that could keep us busy and we could do something productive instead of wasting our time reading threads like &quot;The hardest shit you have had&quot;.

Now i heard someone say that this is the no.1 runescape cheating community, while all i ever hear here is people complaining about other people. If you want this to be the no.1, you have to do something. It won&#39;t happen by itself.

Even though i posted stupid shit too and made fun of other people(King Redrum) , i apoligise for that.


My question here is: Do you want this to change or leave everything as it is?</description>

              <p>You’re using “we” like you’re speaking for all the people on the forum.<br>
I’m sure there are a few people who would like to have some things changed here<br>
.<br>
I like to do productive things and not waste my time.<br>
It may seem selfish to just come here and start asking people to make changes because i want to do something with my spare time.<br>
But i thought there would be people who think the same like me and would like to do something.</p>
<p>anyway, if anyone is interested in working on some project(non runescape related), contact me.<br>
If anyone is interested in a runescape related project, just post it here.</p>
<p>Thats all i have to say</p>

That’s because no-one cares or could be fucked too. Define change- How far is your expectation of change within the community? And what’s the outcome?</p>

<p>True enough, which a lot of people understand I’m sure, but with this there needs to be some sort of bloody intelligence, which as of right now, (and don’t take it as if I’m calling you, Kane, or anyone else idiots or that you are not intelligent, that is not my meaning) seems that there is none. If people could remain mature and bare a sense of intelligence, while at the same time, having a good laugh and voicing their opinions, it would be better off I believe.</p>
<p>Newer members could join and instead of running away as soon as they see one of our threads, they too would join in and laugh. As it is now, every new member we receive, is chased off and flamed until they leave besides those who have enough balls to weather it, which is very few.</p>

That’s because no-one cares or could be fucked too. Define change- How far is your expectation of change within the community? And what’s the outcome?</p>
<p>Everyone might find the community boring, then. It’s basically why everyone comes here; to express opinion, flame, laugh.</p>

<p>The administrators here admit that the forums are fucked up, but the question is, <span class="bbcode-i">WILL</span> they do something to fix it?

<p>You could play “The Wheels on the Bus” for all I care, just so long as the community changes for the betterment, in a sense. Then again, as you said, you like it and some others do too, but also scares away newer members, who can’t handle the shit that this forum gathers day after day.</p>
<p>Meaning eventually, it will only be those who were previously here, which means nothing new can be taught, meaning that in the end, MITB was as pointless as a condom with a hole in it.</p>
<p>That’s just my two cents worth, though.</p>
