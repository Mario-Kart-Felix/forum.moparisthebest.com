    <title>I&#39;m curious</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-curious/441205</link>
    <description>There is a recent topic in the report section of the forum (http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,543871.0.html) where tom was saying when a Res is gone of property it&#39;s okay to grief the property but also if there was no sign of activity.  I find the sign of inactivity part hard to be able to say if there is a res on it.  Also if you go by the inactivity does that mean someone who just hasn&#39;t been on for a few months I can destroy their place, but then if they get on I wont get banned due to them being inactive?

The main problem I have about the griefing when the res is gone is that in an earlier topic it was said
[quote=&quot;Tom_BETA, post:4, topic:431400&quot;]Where&#39;d you get this idea that no res = open property? Not only is that not the case, but it also wouldn&#39;t make sense for it to be the case. Considering that you can only have one residence and a lot of people on W1 had multiple properties with only one of them protected does that mean all their other actively used properties can be griefed within the rules?[/quote]

I&#39;m just confusing.  Tom has just said two different things so I&#39;m confused about it.  I would like it to be cleared up.</description>

<p>You’ll notice I spoke in Nokturths topic about other factors affecting the fact that people <span class="bbcode-b">could</span> potentially take the blocks regardless of staff enforcement without residence.</p>
<p>I’ll say this once as well - this is about the OP, not about Nokturths situation which has been settled between me and him, in short, your input isn’t required as none of you understand the situation to which it occurred.</p>
<p>Though I’ll be honest, an expired residence does suggest inactivity, over a residence that never existed. I do think we need clearer distinction between determining when you’re allowed to destroy things as it can be a tedious process for most players - I’ll draft a few ideas right now  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
