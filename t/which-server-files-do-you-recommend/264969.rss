    <title>Which server files do you recommend?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-server-files-do-you-recommend/264969</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if this is the proper forum section so I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t know where else to put it...


Which server would you recommend for a beginner? I know java to a point enough to get by and I wanna know what would be a good server to edit and use... I like being able to edit stuff so I can edit stuff in game and not have to open notepad all the time but ya...


I&#39;ve read stuff on 508 and I kinda like what can be done with it.
I&#39;ve used DeltaScape, moparscape, cheesescape and I don&#39;t really have a favorite because I haven&#39;t really gotten into them excessively.


So whats your recommendation?</description>
