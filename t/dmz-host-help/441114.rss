    <title>DMZ host [help]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dmz-host-help/441114</link>
    <description>Okay i have the option to select DMZ host on my verizon router.

I was told this automatically opens up all ports and you don&#39;t have to portforward.

I did this, putting my public IP address into the DMZ host, and my server will still not go online

PLEASE SOMEONE HELP. EITHER VIA MSN OR TEAMVIEWER.

MSN: Mod_GH@hotmail.com

Thankss,</description>
