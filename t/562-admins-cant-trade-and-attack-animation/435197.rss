    <description>Hey i&#39;ve been on google trying to look for solutions for the  Admins can&#39;t trade enable but they don&#39;t work for me. the source is alhass and tkoscape.
And for attack animation i keep punching with some of the sword&#39;s such as Korasi, D scimmy, D long etc and it rarely does the correct animation and i put the ids with the weps id&#39;s to the line in Equipment.java that has the properly working animation like iron scimmy and rune scimmy....</description>
