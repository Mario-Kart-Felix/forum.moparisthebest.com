    <title>How Do I add / Edit Shops? ( Devolution V7.0 )</title>

    <description>Hello , _vengeance said RS2Dv is a good source.
But I don&#39;t find a TUT how to add / Edit shops on it.
I need it because the shops on it are pretty basic stuff and I want to add stuff like whips !
Can any one post a tut about it?
I really need it !</description>

              <p>Well i haven’t been with moparscape for a while sooo<br>
IM NO EXPERT ON THIS!!!</p>
<p>I forget how to add shops and i am too lazy to search… but i know how to edit/make one in the shops.cfg… okkk so first go to you’re server folder… and open shops.cfg… If you don’t have one you can either try to make one or go to a source and get one… First after you open the shop.cfg… if you don’t have any shops it will have the shop id and stuff sell buy item amounts and all that stuff. then there will be a text of [ENDOFSHOPLIST] Between those two texts make a space if there already is one then just follow from here on first you will put a shopid and put something like this <code>shop = 99</code> it doesnt have to be 99 but choose an id that isn’t already taken then name it obviously then put how much you would like to buy/sell it for. then over it will be the item 15335 is one of the GS so that will be a item id for the shop. then put the amount of how many is in there like 99… Then keep doing with whatever items you choose… To make a shop with npc… (just figured out again) go to autospawn.cfg and put where you will place him. (coordinates) and put him the npc id you want him. and that will be you’re shop guy. go to client and search a normal runescape shop like zaff… (CTRL+F) now find the end of that shop list and add this</p>
<p><code>}
 else if (NPCID == ####) { // SHOP NAME IN HERE (HAS TO BE SAME AS SHOP IN SHOPS.CFG)
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = ##;</code></p>
<p>CHANGE THE #### NEXT TO NPCID TO THE NPCID YOU WANT YOU’RE PERSON TO BE (SHOPOWNER)<br>
change the ## to the set id you had for shops.cfg since mine is 99 i would replace ## with 99…<br>
Ok so that’s done now save and now i believe it’s done. Save and compile run you’re server go to the coordinates you put you’re guy and talk to him and see if the shop works.</p>
