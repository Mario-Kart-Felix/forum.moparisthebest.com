    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/running-silab-client/337327</link>
    <description>i cant run the client, when i run the batch file it appears and quickly dissapears. i geuss this is because its not able to find my jdk.

anyone has a solution to this? maybe a batch file that can run a jar file and where you can manually put in the directory of your jdk?</description>
