Heres the things i changed [code] //Setting player standard look
		playerLook[0] = 0;
		playerLook[1] = 7;
		playerLook[2] = 8;
		playerLook[3] = 9;
		playerLook[4] =5;
		playerLook[5] = 0;

		/*playerLook[0] = 1;
		playerLook[1] = 5;
		playerLook[2] = 5;
		playerLook[3] = 6;
		playerLook[4] = 5;
		playerLook[5] = 10;*/

		//Giving the player an unique look
		playerEquipment[playerHat]=6109;
		playerEquipment[playerCape]=6111;
		playerEquipment[playerAmulet]=1704;
		playerEquipment[playerChest]=6107;
		playerEquipment[playerShield]=3842;
		playerEquipment[playerLegs]=6108;
		playerEquipment[playerHands]=6110;
		playerEquipment[playerFeet]=6106;
		playerEquipment[playerRing]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerArrows]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerWeapon]=1323;
