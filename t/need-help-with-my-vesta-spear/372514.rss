              <p>how can a client…not…work? I mean, this is Private servers here. We arent talking about trying to use a C++ program to play a java server. Any client should work for any server as long as its the right version. 317 377 508 etc. Though honestly i dont think it even needs the right version. As crossovers are possible. It all comes down to how hard you want to try to make it work.</p>

              <p>[quote=“jakanddax222, post:4, topic:372514”]Is your client downloaded client, pre-made web-client, or a client that you made into a web-client yourself? If it’s a downloaded client or client you made into a web-client, look inside the folder you should find a file called ( Oh before I go on, I use a delta v16 client base, whats yours? You may have a different one that has different file names ) class8 or itemdef ( not really sure if that’s the name for re-named but its as close as I can think of ) Hopefully it’s class8 ( because if it is I can help you more ) when you go inside do ctrl+F and search “Vesta” when you find your spear you will also find a lot of code like:</p>
<p><code>if(i == 8063){
class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
class8.aStringArray189[1] = "Wear";
class8.anIntArray156 = new int[0];
class8.anIntArray160 = new int[0];
class8.anInt174 = 15117;
class8.anInt181 = 1957;
class8.anInt190 = 498;
class8.anInt198 = 484;
class8.anInt204 = 0;
class8.anInt169 = -1;
class8.anInt194 = -1;
class8.anInt175 = -1;
class8.anInt197 = -1;
class8.anInt165 = 15118;
class8.anInt200 = 15118;
class8.aBoolean176 = false;
class8.aString170 = "Vesta Spear";
class8.aByteArray178 = "A spear.".getBytes();
}</code><br>
These are called you model INT’s and each model has them, each <code>class8.anInt200 = 15118;</code> stands for something, this one stands for the male wield model I think, Any way a few of these lines are the rotations and zooms, you use these to rotate and zoom in and out of the model, while it is in your Inventory. I don’t have the right INT’s but if I ever get them I’ll post them up, but try looking around, some people take a lot of time to get the zooms and rotations correct, copy then down and add them but show some gratitude, like saying thanks or rep++ don’t just leach.[/quote]</p>
<p>Im Using Demise Pking V5 Client<br>
but i coded some things myself what your saying i already did all of that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
