<li>This does not relate to Server Help.</li>
<li>If you want to be a part of a team, post in the Development Teams section  instead</li>
<li>Don’t expect someone to do all of the work on your server and just get “admin status”. They’d be much better off making their own for that sort of reward.</li>
<li>Mention donations on your own site, not here.</li>
