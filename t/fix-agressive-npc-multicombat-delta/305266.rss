    <title>Fix Agressive Npc Multicombat [Delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fix-agressive-npc-multicombat-delta/305266</link>
    <description>Ever notice how when you get near a lot of aggressive npc&#39;s on delta&#39;s base, they all seem to ignore the fact that its non-multi and attack all at once? This should fix most of it, please note that on rare occasions 2 of them may be able to get on you at once, if someone finds a way to fix this please tell me.

Ok, this is a pretty short and easy fix so lets get rolling...

[b]First, Open up your NPCHandler...[/b]

Find (using ctrl +f if necessary)
[code]public void annoyNpcs(int npcId) {
		for(Player p : server.playerHandler.players) {
			if(p != null) {
				client player = (client)p;[/code] 

[b]
Now right under[/b]
[code]client player = (client)p[/code]
[b]
Add this...[/b]
[code]		if ((player.inCombat) &amp;&amp; !player.multiCombat()){
		return;
		}
[/code]



Basically what this says is, if the player the npc is trying to attack is already in combat, then it won&#39;t attack. Hopefully you understood that. 

Thanks for reading my tutorial, I hope it helped you out!</description>
