    <title>A Smithing Issue *Still Unsolved*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-smithing-issue-still-unsolved/445191</link>
    <description>I am having trouble with the smelting interface on the cleaned up delta source I&#39;m using.

The problem is occurs when I attempt to use a Smelt 1, Smelt 5, Smelt 10, or Smelt X button in-game. 

What happens is exactly this: Nothing.

I know there has to be a break in the code of the button, but I&#39;m not sure as to where. I believe that my if(UsedOnItemID) code is correct, but just in case here is an example of the process used to make bronze bars from tin and copper:

[code]if(UsedOnObjectID == 3044 &amp;&amp; ItemID == 438 &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(436)){
       deleteItem(436, 1);
       deleteItem(438, 1);
              addItem(2349, 1);
       sM(&quot;You smith the tin and copper ore.&quot;);
       setAnimation(899);
              faceNPC(UsedOnObjectID);
       addSkillXP(800, 13);
}[/code]

In a normal server, this [b]should[/b] work with no frame being sent, correct? On this one, if I delete the sendFrame code that calls upon the smelting menu, nothing still happens. 

I believe that the issue lies somewhere in this partition of code that seems to handle all smelting acts:

[code]			if (UsedOnObjectID == 3994 || UsedOnObjectID == 3044) {
				for (int fi = 0; fi &lt; misc.smelt_frame.length; fi++)
					sendFrame246(misc.smelt_frame[fi], 150, misc.smelt_bars[fi]);
					sendFrame164(2400);
				// smelting = true;
				// smelt_id = ItemID;
			}[/code]

I see a lot of references into the misc.java folder, but nothing seems awry. For the sake of my slight inexperience with it I&#39;ll post the lines of code this refers to:

[code]	public static int[] buttons_smelting = { 15147, 15146, 10247, 9110, 15151,
			15150, 15149, 15148, 15155, 15154, 15153, 15152, 15159, 15158,
			15157, 15156, 15163, 15162, 15161, 15160, 29017, 29016, 24253,
			16062, 29022, 29020, 29019, 29018, 29026, 29025, 29024, 29023 };[/code]

[code]	public static int[] smelt_bars = { 2349, 2351, 2355, 2353, 2357, 2359,
			2361, 2363 };

	public static int[] smelt_frame = { 2405, 2406, 2407, 2409, 2410, 2411,
			2412, 2413 };[/code]

What I&#39;m asking for help with is to find the break in code that makes the Smelt 1,5,10, and x buttons not work. If that is not possible, then some assistance in completely getting rid of the &quot;What would you like to smelt?&quot; frame would be very much appreciated. 

If you need any other pieces of code from the source, I will gladly post them for you. I do apologize for the wall of text, but I believe the problem lies herein.

tl;dr Smith 1,5,10, and x is not working and in spite of my efforts, I cannot find a solution.

Thank you all and have a wonderful day. Any and all help is appreciated.

Also as an off-note, if there is any way for me to stop the objects that I&#39;ve deleted with the deleteThatObject line of code from loading each time the area is travelled into or someone logs on near them telling me how it&#39;s done would be very kind of you.</description>
