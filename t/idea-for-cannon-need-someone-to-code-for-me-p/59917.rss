    <description>ok, my idea is when you click &quot;fire&quot; on a cannon, its brings up an interface with a list of npcs within about 15 spaces of you. you click on the name of the npc you wanna shot and it hits the npc! but i have somewhat of an idea how to do it, but i couldnt do it if i tried. could someone come up with it and show me? or is this not even possible?</description>

              <p>I guess you can do something where the closest npcs would be listed in your quest menu or something, but thats it. You cant make an interface because it is not in the cache files. Well, you can use a interface that is used for something else. I would tell you that the bank pin interface is best for this.</p>
<p>If anyone knows the id for the bank pin interface, I would be glad to program this for your server and for mine.</p>
