    <title>Need help picking a good source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-picking-a-good-source/356924</link>
    <description>I am currently running a 508 as my main source, it is more &quot;Skilling&quot; than it is &quot;Pvp&quot;.  

People on my server say the reason I am not holding a couple hundred players is because people like to &quot;PVP&quot; more than they like to &quot;Skill&quot;. 

So my question is going to branch out further in the community by coming here and asking what everyone else things about the player ratio from &quot;PVP&quot; to &quot;Skiller&quot;?

Thanks :)</description>

              <p>Well sophia u may beat me in ccoding but i beat u in source choice… i think  =[] if you want total pvp with some skilling there is an old server “PvP Angel” its base would be perfect for what your looking for its base was atomic pkz i think but its spawn but i also know u wuld code it different and the other thing is this is a 317. =\</p>
