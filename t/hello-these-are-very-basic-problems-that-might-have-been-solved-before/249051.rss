    <description>Hello, today i am asking some of you out there to answer these very basic and simple questions:

1.Fixing the extra hair out of the player&#39;s helmet.
2.Fixing the jaw/chin of the player.
3.Fixing any weapon emotes that you have, just send me the code and location of where to store it.
4.Is it possibe to make an option where you can create and make your character how you want him to look?
5.Making the characters female/male.

I would truly appreciate it if someone could answer some, or even one, whatever helps.  :)</description>
