    <description>I&#39;m being sued for changing a gmail password. 
http://rsclabs.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=1166

&lt;blockquote&gt;Excuse me? I am Acid and I never once played with peoples bot I only played mine I didn&#39;t care about others I helped and moderated until people started to play games and ban me all the time. If anything I Leaked every bodies characters.

I am filing Legal Actions in the result of Nade a Canadian accessing my Gmail Adress and public shareing my email without my consent.

I have already contacted my Lawyer and filled for legal rep and proceeding of my case. Nade left evidence of his actions which is illegal in the United States where I as a Citizen has rights and must be protected. I also have his IP and asked my lawyer to contact his service provider for more information on &quot;Nade&quot; to proceed with actions as he see&#39;s fit under my guidance. It is illegal to hack a GMAIL.COM Address read the terms also GMAIL will be following up since it was under there server that this information and attempted and login was initiated. I have taken actions because I have valuable work and information that must not be shared or seen by anyone as files are protected under legal rights and disclaimer which give me the right to pursue actions against anyone foreign or domestic.

I have the best lawyer in all of The State Of Florida there is no hiding or fleeing from this one.

Sincerely, My Name

              <p>Changing a password is not something that can get you in trouble with the law here in the US, trust me, I know from personal experience :P. My cuzin pissed me off, so I changed passwords to all of her emails, and website users (about 50 things in total -.-), she contacted the local police. The police looked at her and said “It is your responsibility to keep your emails and passwords safe, there is no real harm done, so there is nothing we can do”.</p>
<p>In other words, if this actually goes to court, he’s going to be wasting money.</p>
