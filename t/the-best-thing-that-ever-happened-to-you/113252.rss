    <title>The best thing that ever happened to you</title>

    <description>As I understand it, it&#39;s Java, C++, and C mixed into one orgasmic explosion. Something that will force you to consult your doctor about the one week boner issue. 

It&#39;s pretty new (Release: Jan, 2007), it&#39;s gaining popularity due to how much Microsoft let us down with .net. The .net framework in my opinion is about as efficient as skateboarding for a method of transportation. Invest in a bike for fuck sake. Especially with vb, which I use to slap some code together quickly in case something comes up. I was hoping for faster performance, lower file size and more features. It turned out to be a disappointment. The Beta2 release was like the worst day of my life. The only awesome feature in vb.net was the console application, and the uninstall file which I used to get rid of that shit.

I mainly hate .net just because those fuckers at Microsoft want to own everything. They buy out all the small awesome companies like SysInternals and make them into another shit-link on their website.

Anyways, here:

Edit:
[code=cpp]
import std.stdio;       // for writefln()

int main(char[][] args)
{
    // Declare an associative array with string keys and
    // arrays of strings as data
    char[][] [char[]] container;

    // Add some people to the container and let them carry some items
    container[&quot;Anya&quot;] ~= &quot;scarf&quot;;
    container[&quot;Dimitri&quot;] ~= &quot;tickets&quot;;
    container[&quot;Anya&quot;] ~= &quot;puppy&quot;;

    // Iterate over all the persons in the container
    foreach (char[] person, char[][] items; container)
        display_item_count(person, items);
    return 0;
}

void display_item_count(char[] person, char[][] items)
{
    writefln(person, &quot; is carrying &quot;, items.length, &quot; items.&quot;);
}

<p>
 D (or Dlang) is an object-oriented, imperative, multi-paradigm system programming language created by Walter Bright of Digital Mars and released in 2001. Bright was joined in the design and development effort in 2007 by Andrei Alexandrescu. Though it originated as a re-engineering of C++, as suggested by the name, D is a distinct language. It has redesigned some core C++ features, while also sharing characteristics from other languages, notably Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and Eiffel.
