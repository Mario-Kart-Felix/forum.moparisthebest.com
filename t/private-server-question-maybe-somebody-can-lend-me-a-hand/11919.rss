    <title>Private Server Question, maybe somebody can lend me a hand?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/private-server-question-maybe-somebody-can-lend-me-a-hand/11919</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been reading up on tutorials and I&#39;ve almost got my Private server done. I have already gotten everything from No-IP and configured my Windows firewall, and everything else that the Tuts. said to do. There is only one problem, whenever I try to log into my server it says &quot;Error connecting to server&quot;. I put in the right server name and everything, is there actually a start button or what. Thanks.  :)

              <p>when i started i couldnt connect to the no-ip hostname so i used hamachi… it works<br>
use the number at the top ex. 5.194.241.293   (not mine, sorry for whoevers it is)<br>
and other people should be able to log on</p>
