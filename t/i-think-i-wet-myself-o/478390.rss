Evidence suggests that a single plasticity mechanism is not sufficient and a multiple plasticity mechanism is needed to account for the storage of motor memories over time.

[/quote][/quote]<br>
You have provided no examples, at all. I don’t observe others training cycles so I don’t have information about others - you don’t observe others training cycles either and so your input would be as valuable as mine, yet you didn’t apply any examples which makes it less so.</p>
<p>Like I said, grabbing a bar is grabbing a bar, the location of the bar does not matter - you consolidate a specific <span class="bbcode-b">motor task</span> into memory, you don’t consolidate a specific task into memory. When you practice on monkey bars, you don’t commit practicing on monkey bars into memory, you commit grabbing bars in sequence - much like the person on the video is doing.[/quote]</p>

You have provided no examples, at all. I don’t observe others training cycles so I don’t have information about others - you don’t observe others training cycles either and so your input would be as valuable as mine, yet you didn’t apply any examples which makes it less so.</p>
<p>Like I said, grabbing a bar is grabbing a bar, the location of the bar does not matter - you consolidate a specific <span class="bbcode-b">motor task</span> into memory, you don’t consolidate a specific task into memory. When you practice on monkey bars, you don’t commit practicing on monkey bars into memory, you commit grabbing bars in sequence - much like the person on the video is doing.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Ambokile, post:32, topic:478390”]It’s nearly impossible to give a certain amount of repetitions needed to achieve muscle memory. I learnt how to touch type a lot quicker than I learned how to ride a bike, even though I would be using a computer once a day and also riding a bike once a day. How many “repetitions” are involved to learn it? If I am riding a bike, do I need to pedal 1000 times to learn how to pedal properly? Do I need to go on 1000 journeys? Will it take 1000 days? Putting a number is not accurate and will not be accurate. If I learn to ride a bike in a foot of snow, it will take a lot longer for me to be able to ride than someone who rides in a flat car park.<br>
Also, you said that this is “hard to believe” as he would take time to achieve muscle memory. Sometimes, with friends, I go freerunning. I recently travelled to Central London and did some freerunning in some of the parks before. I had never jumped between these kind of platforms before (concrete corner posts of varying heights with gaps between) yet I still managed to do them successfully nearly every time.<br>
Look at the construction of the crane, it is comprised of cylindrical bars (mainly)… just like <a href="http://www.outdoor-play.co.uk/images/action/monkey-bars.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this? (its a link, click it)</a> I had practised freerunning at other locations and yet I was able to freerun at this location, so why couldn’t he train at another location and then do it successfully at a crane?[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re determined to prove me wrong, and yet you only give <span class="bbcode-b">personal</span> examples from your own experiences? Wow, well played indeed. I don’t believe you understand what you’re talking about, based upon what you’ve posted.</p>
<blockquote>Muscle memory has been used synonymously with motor learning, which is a form of procedural memory that [b]involves consolidating a specific motor task into memory through repetition. When a movement is repeated over time, a long-term muscle memory is created for that task, eventually allowing it to be performed without conscious effort.[/b] This process decreases the need for attention and creates maximum efficiency within the motor and memory systems. Examples of muscle memory are found in many everyday activities that become automatic and improve with practice, such as riding a bicycle, typing on a keyboard, typing in a PIN, playing a melody or phrase on a musical instrument, playing video games, or performing different algorithms for a Rubik's Cube.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Evidence suggests that a single plasticity mechanism is not sufficient and a multiple plasticity mechanism is needed to account for the storage of motor memories over time. Regardless of the mechanism, studies of cerebellar-dependent motor tasks show that cerebral cortical plasticity is crucial for motor learning.</blockquote>
