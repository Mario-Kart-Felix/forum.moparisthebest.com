    <title>RSC Psp Emulation?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsc-psp-emulation/322722</link>
    <description>Well as we all know, RSC is a game that really doesn&#39;t need high specs pc&#39;s in order to run the game. Now I was wondering if an RSC client could be ported over to the psp as an application perhaps? Don&#39;t know much about java (learning python atm :P), but it seems fairly possible don&#39;t you think?</description>

<p>iPhone will never run Java applications, theres too much money in apple having their own OS and SDK. Even if someone built a VM using apples SDK it would be fucking awful since the SDK doesn’t allow for low-level interaction.</p>

<p>


 iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android.
 Originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone, iOS has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch (September 2007) and the iPad (January 2010). A...</p>

<blockquote>Apple has not announced any plans to enable Java to run on the iPhone. Sun Microsystems announced plans to release a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for iPhone OS, based on the Java Platform, Micro Edition version of Java. This would enable Java applications to run on iPhone and iPod Touch.[43]
Soon after the announcement, developers familiar with the SDK's terms of agreement believed that by not allowing 3rd-party applications to run in the background (answer a phone call and still run the application, for example),[44] allowing an application to download code from another source, or allowing an application to interact with a 3rd-party application (Safari with JVM, for example), could hinder development of the JVM without Apple's cooperation[45].
It is clear that Java running on the iPhone is outside the bounds of the iPhone SDK Agreement. The guideline in question is rule 3.3.2, which reads:
<p>3.3.2 — An Application may not itself install or launch other executable code by any means, including without limitation through the use of a plug-in architecture, calling other frameworks, other APIs or otherwise. No interpreted code may be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple’s Documented APIs and built-in interpreter(s).</p>
<p>However, some iPhone users have shown that it was possible to install and use a J2ME stack on an iPhone, though it involved jailbreaking[46][47].<br>
It has also been revealed that there were talks between Sun and Apple concerning the availability of Java on the iPhone, and that Sun was working in that intent with a company called Innaworks[48][49]. Since it is required that all ARM9 or later processors include Jazelle support, the iPhone includes the hardware for accelerated Java execution.[50].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I checked over a few search results with trying to get java vm running on a jailbroken ipod touch/iphone. It has been done but its all command line and lacks gui support. My 1st gen ipod touch has 128mb of RAM so I doubt it being able to. The 3gs iphone (3rd generation) which is underclocked to 600mhz and which has 256mb of RAM most likely could run it. If the java virtual machine software can run the client after all, I wonder what it would do as far as displaying a full screen GUI. Maybe the native on screen keyboard would work if the hacked JavaVM supported it. It looks like the VM can compile but is extremely slow, which leads me to think that the device would provide a terrible frame rate if at all. Honestly, your better off just playing RSC over remote desktop on a low latency internet connection. Thats what I do with my HTC Touch Pro smartphone…</p>

              <p>that is a real good idea. There’s a view problems though. You couldn’t use the psp applications because they can’t use a mouse so you couldn’t click to move. You would have to do some serious programming to let you control your player. And how would you put items on. You couldn’t “use” item because there’s know right click.<br>
There’s one thing you could do though. There are psp apps that will allow you to control your computer from your psp. You could just open rsc and play it from there.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
