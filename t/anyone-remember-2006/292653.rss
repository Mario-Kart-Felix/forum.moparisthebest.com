              <p>I remember… The first server I ever played was something called BlackScape. The first server I coded (a basic leech) was off of Pkisle… I called it GuthanScape. Then I made a dodian base which was coded 50% by me because of all my work, and features I added. That was GuthanScape 2… But that was a Jagex server (silab). My first (the leech) was the greatest one. I also hosted a couple edited pimpscape’s, and may start working on a 317 mopar compatible BarelyScape.</p>

I <span class="bbcode-b">HIGHLY</span> agree with you Lin, I didn’t play servers until this early March, and it was a Delta base and I thought it was fun, but you had to site AGES at assault getting bandos/DFS/etc; and it got boring if you died pking, and the exp was somewhat fast, 3k a hit, took forever to get some 99’s though, and who ever say Silab servers have the best, most awesome pking, you need to get a god damn brain scan, Silab pking sucks ass on multiple levels, I mean your wearing full armadyl with obby maul and dfs with like 500+ bonuses, and the pking,veng, etc; is trash/garbage/worthless, I mean why not go on a real <span class="bbcode-b">DOWNLOADABLE</span> client and pk on there where it is real bonuses for somewhat real pking, anyways, I think the old '06 servers sounded fun, but did they have the emote teleports, if they did, they I really don’t like them already.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I honestly think that rsps clients are getting by the day, while are servers are going the other way. 06 servers were a phase, silab was a phase, and now we haved moved on to the ‘delta’ phase. These phases are getting worse. We can’t help but to watch these phases pass by us by as we just sit here and say ’ SHET SHET SHET!!!11!1!! DELTA SUCKS BAWLS!!! WHERE IS PROJECT 16!!! ’</p>
<p>Silab is better than what we have now, and '06 was better than silab, the only way to stop this viscous cycle is to make a balance of servers, the only servers we see these days are deltascape based. The only thing we can do, and what i say we SHOULD do is make a HUGE project and give a server base to each of the more active moparscapers (So not just the vets xD) so we have some czar here, devo there, all star behind, and 06 in the front.[/quote]</p>
<p>Servers are getting better as time goes by. Only the typical MoparScaper uses the shit we all say we hate yet still use. If we are to get out of this mess, we need to use the great frameworks provided.</p>
