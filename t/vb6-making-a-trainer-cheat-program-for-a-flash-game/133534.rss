    <title>[VB6]Making a trainer/cheat program for a flash game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vb6-making-a-trainer-cheat-program-for-a-flash-game/133534</link>
    <description>since most flash games use variables for HP , money and things like that then you can changethem on visual basic, you need:

SoThinks swf decompiler
Visual basics 6
A little actionscript knowledge.

Not needed but helps:
macromedia flash(i use 8(kinda outdated :P))

Go to the game you want to make the trainer for, then if your using firefox go to the media tab and look for the SWF URL copy, make note of it. 

If your using IE then go to C:\documents and settings\*windows logon name*\local settings\temporary internet files\ and look for a swf folder (i usually delete temp internet files before going on the game site so its the only site there) once you have found it right click&gt;properties then look at the URL and note it.

Now you have the url go to C:\documents and settings\*windows logon name*\local settings\temporary internet files\ and find the SWF file of your game (told you how in IE steps) and copy it to somewhere you will remember.

start up SoThinks and open the SWf you just copied, then in the right box expand the folder then open up actions and look for a flash variable int hem files usually somethink like player.health or somethign similar to be called upon some time, if you have macromedia flash then export it(you will need the SoThinks decompiler full version for action script to be decompiled) then the top layer is the actionscript layer if you looks through them frames you can see the variables easier.

now start up your VB and go to project &gt; components &gt; shockwave flash and tick next to it, press ok.
and make the box something like this(yours will be blank):
[URL=http://img514.imageshack.us/my.php?image=trainergw1.png][IMG]http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/8530/trainergw1.th.png[/img][/URL]
(ignore the buttons for now)

then click on the flash form thing whatever its called, then in properties at the very top of the list where it says Custom click it then click the &quot;...&quot; then in url paste you flash games URL.

Search through the actions folder(Or action layer if using flash 8) and look for vairables.
then create a button once you have found your variable and say you wanted to change your kills on stickarena to a defined amount in a text box when you click the button then open the code view and put this:
[code]
Private Sub Killset_Click()
Call Flash1.SetVariable(&quot;player.pKills&quot;, TxtKills.Text)
End Sub
[/code]
this will make it so when you click a button names Killset it will set the number in the game to the number in Txtkills textbox.

if you wanted to change your name colour then i just create a text box and hide it behind the flash document with #000000 in it and call it blackname and put this in the code:
[code]
Private Sub Command1_Click()
Call Flash1.SetVariable(&quot;player.hexColor&quot;, BlackName.Text)
End Sub
[/code]


I will be uploading some of my vbp files so you can use it for help.
just give me time :P

EDIT:
Here are the trainers i have made:

              <p>yea but advanced users of action script can use the same variable for loads of things… xeno tactic is kinda like that so its hard to change the variable and get the right results.</p>
