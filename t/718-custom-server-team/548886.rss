    <description>Hello everyone I’m Gromic and I’m looking to get a 718 RSPS off the ground, but alas my issue is I’m a bit new to RSPS development and java. I have a project idea I’ve been working out concepts for and have a variety of content I would love to get put together. Things covering skilling, PvM &amp; Endgame bossing and PvP… So with that I’m looking for developers interested in such a project, though I understand almost every concept will take time so not expecting miracles overnight.  Some ideas for the server can be put in the following categories.

Solo &amp; Team bosses
Variety of pking options
Skilling centers
World events

And a few more we can discuss if you are interested. Feel free to add me on skype ( joe.lewis36 ) and we’ll talk more about the project. I already have a very solid host for the project during development so that will not be an issue. Also have everything set up for the base source to be launchable and publicly accessible via any 718+ client. I do have a client prepared with proper java downloads to ensure it will compile and run w/o an issue.  Also have a base gaming community website&amp; teamspeak 3 server available for the server so communication can be easy outside of skype as well. Hopefully talk to you soon, have a great day!</description>
