    <title>Item &quot;Certer&quot; (Like Miles, Niles, Giles in RSC and Stiles in RS)</title>

    <description>I want to add an item &quot;certer&quot;, I&#39;m not sure which item I would like him to cert yet but can anyone tell me how to go about it? I&#39;m using a delta source.

I thought something like

[code=java]if(npcID == ####){
deleteItem(###, #);
addItem(###, #);
sM(&quot; ____ has noted your ____&quot;);
}[/code]

The problem is with this that you could have none of the item and still get some of the item noted.
I thought about some kind of

[code=java]ifPlayerHasItem(####, #){[/code]

But then it would only work if you had that exact amount of the item, can someone help me?</description>
