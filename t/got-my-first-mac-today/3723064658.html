<p>No, I do not know enough about linux to really talk about it, I said that. ( I think I was like 12-ish when I did use Linux…it was all very new to me back then …and have not really been able to do anything with it since.)</p>
<p>Windows 98 is a great OS …I do not know what you are talking about =P ( Besides, the blue screen of death is a rare experience &amp; not much of an inconvenience for me lol, just restart. Usually only came up when I did something wrong XD )</p>
<p>'You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about &amp; shut up about windows 98, you don’t deserve to talk about its awesome-ness. ’</p>
<p>I do not think you have any clue what you are talking about… I do not think you know anything about me, and my personal experiences with computers.<br>
Mac OS 9.2 was sh** for me, and barely loaded anything, and was slow as sh** The Mac OS 9.2’s got regular maintaining &amp; hardware cleaning /vacuuming. My Windows 98 machine on the other hand ,  never got cleaned, and was dusty as ****… it should of went up in flames from the dust clogging up the hardware. Same specs for both.  The Windows 98 computer ran faster, loaded things better…and is also the better OS. Mac only beat Windows 98 with their OS X =P</p>
<p>Please don’t flame…if you have something very negative to say, do not say it…but I won’t stop you if you do decide to do something so pointless…</p>
<p>Oh well. If you say something about Windows someone will bound to flame at you for mentioning it if they likez teh Mac =P</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">‘the mac is just for looks’</span></p>
<p>Oh come on, give it more credit than that , at least it works right? It does look really cool though. ( Which is why some people decided to make a Mac OS toolbar for Windows…you know the one at the bottom of the screen which hosts your icons and programs and such .Their just jealous of the Mac’s cool looks and wished they had a Mac for it’s cool looks, so imported one to Windows.)<br>

<p>That is so…sweetly…sweet. I cannot descibe the amount of epic there. I didn’t even know laptops were made when windows 3.1 was out? That is sooo cool  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/coolae52.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"> Most Epic.</p>

You want me to give it more ‘credit’ than that, yet you cannot find one reason why (nor have you stated) it is not just good for looks, downloading, and web surfing.</p>

<p>No, I do not know enough about linux to really talk about it, I said that. ( I think I was like 12-ish when I did use Linux…it was all very new to me back then …and have not really been able to do anything with it since.)</p>
<p>Windows 98 is a great OS …I do not know what you are talking about =P ( Besides, the blue screen of death is a rare experience &amp; not much of an inconvenience for me lol, just restart. Usually only came up when I did something wrong XD )</p>
<p>'You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about &amp; shut up about windows 98, you don’t deserve to talk about its awesome-ness. ’</p>
<p>I do not think you have any clue what you are talking about… I do not think you know anything about me, and my personal experiences with computers.<br>
Mac OS 9.2 was sh** for me, and barely loaded anything, and was slow as sh** The Mac OS 9.2’s got regular maintaining &amp; hardware cleaning /vacuuming. My Windows 98 machine on the other hand ,  never got cleaned, and was dusty as ****… it should of went up in flames from the dust clogging up the hardware. Same specs for both.  The Windows 98 computer ran faster, loaded things better…and is also the better OS. Mac only beat Windows 98 with their OS X =P</p>
<p>Please don’t flame…if you have something very negative to say, do not say it…but I won’t stop you if you do decide to do something so pointless…</p>
<p>Oh well. If you say something about Windows someone will bound to flame at you for mentioning it if they likez teh Mac =P</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">‘the mac is just for looks’</span></p>
<p>Oh come on, give it more credit than that , at least it works right? It does look really cool though. ( Which is why some people decided to make a Mac OS toolbar for Windows…you know the one at the bottom of the screen which hosts your icons and programs and such .Their just jealous of the Mac’s cool looks and wished they had a Mac for it’s cool looks, so imported one to Windows.)<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><br>
‘omg I still have an old laptop with win3.1… 8MB ram bitches’</span></p>
<p>That is so…sweetly…sweet. I cannot descibe the amount of epic there. I didn’t even know laptops were made when windows 3.1 was out? That is sooo cool  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/coolae52.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"> Most Epic.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You do not understand how stupid you look right now, all you are doing is speaking about a topic that no one gives a shit about, stop talking to hear yourself talk, 'Aaron.[/quote]</p>
<p>I believe your the one who initiated this topic. I wouldn’t have posted it if you didn’t. And if you did not care, why did you post that? I am obviously not talking to myself since you posted that idiotic post. And if the original topic poster did not care, why did he make this topic then?<br>
Look, if I don’t care, and if you don’t care, then we are in agreement. Stop flaming. There is no argument here. You might just end up flaming more than my friend is flaming. Please contribute to the topic, and if you can’t, and have anything negative to say, keep to to yourself, no one cares. Look 'Aaron, you are the one with the problem. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. You have not lived my life. My experiences are different than yours. You think slightly differently. You do not agree with me. You know nothing about my life and experiences. Keep Quiet, who cares. Gut Zu Wissen? Guten.  I have not said anything bad about you ever, so why do this for me?<br>
Ich danken jeder hasst mich hier nur weil ich bin Deutsch…</p>

—Actually, I was agreeing with them that Mac OS X is a pretty cool, &amp; good OS. But I was also saying that the OS before Mac OS X was horrible, and that Windows 98 was better. In my previous post I said they had about the same specs, but the Windows 98 was actually older and had lower specs, but somehow ran faster than Mac OS 9 &amp; loaded things better.</p>

Please don’t. I was about to add to my post…The first post was to just see Thug’s reaction. Trolling is very new to me =P , but I am not a troll. Yes, obvious troll is obvious XD ( not so much derailing…maybe though ), but I was going to add to my post , so I was not.<br>
I am also myself an aspiring programmer… Back in 2006 / 07 moparscape wasn’t so full of aspiring programmers though…but yes, it is what Moparscape is for ( or else the TOS is Void  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/expressionlessae52.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> )</p>

<p>Ah. Yes sorry. Can we get back on topix please? =]<br>
And it is not the point of randomness to talk about Mac OS 9, since it it the predecessor of os Mac OS X. ( unless it isn’t ,and is also not made by apple? ) …anyways, I was just saying that I remember using it, and how great Mac OS X was of an improvement to it.</p>
