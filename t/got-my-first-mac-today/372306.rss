<p>Facepalm. This is on topic. Apple made Mac OS 9, and Mac OS X . They are all OS’s as well. PLUS, Mac OS 9 is the predecessor of Mac OS X. If it wasn’t for the garbage of Mac OS 9, Mac OS X would not of came out for us to talk about abat having Mac OS X on his new computer.<br>
…sigh…my original post simplified:<br>
It is really great that you got an apple with Mac OS X !  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> It is such a great OS as compared to apples product before that,Mac OS 9…it was not good. I had a windows 98 that had lower specifications and could run faster and do things faster than a higher spec’d Mac OS 9. But yeah, good choice. Mac OS X is great. I really<br>
hope you enjoy using your new computer ^^</p>
<p>Did I need to be flamed at for the above comment? Answer is no. Where has politeness gone on the internet anyways…? I also got flamed at for liking windows when you guys preferred mac. I like cake also, will you flames at me for liking cake because you do not?</p>

—Actually, I was agreeing with them that Mac OS X is a pretty cool, &amp; good OS. But I was also saying that the OS before Mac OS X was horrible, and that Windows 98 was better. In my previous post I said they had about the same specs, but the Windows 98 was actually older and had lower specs, but somehow ran faster than Mac OS 9 &amp; loaded things better.</p>

<p>No, I do not know enough about linux to really talk about it, I said that. ( I think I was like 12-ish when I did use Linux…it was all very new to me back then …and have not really been able to do anything with it since.)</p>
<p>Windows 98 is a great OS …I do not know what you are talking about =P ( Besides, the blue screen of death is a rare experience &amp; not much of an inconvenience for me lol, just restart. Usually only came up when I did something wrong XD )</p>
<p>'You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about &amp; shut up about windows 98, you don’t deserve to talk about its awesome-ness. ’</p>
<p>I do not think you have any clue what you are talking about… I do not think you know anything about me, and my personal experiences with computers.<br>
Mac OS 9.2 was sh** for me, and barely loaded anything, and was slow as sh** The Mac OS 9.2’s got regular maintaining &amp; hardware cleaning /vacuuming. My Windows 98 machine on the other hand ,  never got cleaned, and was dusty as ****… it should of went up in flames from the dust clogging up the hardware. Same specs for both.  The Windows 98 computer ran faster, loaded things better…and is also the better OS. Mac only beat Windows 98 with their OS X =P</p>
<p>Please don’t flame…if you have something very negative to say, do not say it…but I won’t stop you if you do decide to do something so pointless…</p>
<p>Oh well. If you say something about Windows someone will bound to flame at you for mentioning it if they likez teh Mac =P</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">‘the mac is just for looks’</span></p>
<p>Oh come on, give it more credit than that , at least it works right? It does look really cool though. ( Which is why some people decided to make a Mac OS toolbar for Windows…you know the one at the bottom of the screen which hosts your icons and programs and such .Their just jealous of the Mac’s cool looks and wished they had a Mac for it’s cool looks, so imported one to Windows.)<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><br>

<p>That is so…sweetly…sweet. I cannot descibe the amount of epic there. I didn’t even know laptops were made when windows 3.1 was out? That is sooo cool  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"> Most Epic.<br>

<p>You do not understand how stupid you look right now, all you are doing is speaking about a topic that no one gives a shit about, stop talking to hear yourself talk, 'Aaron.[/quote]</p>
<p>I believe your the one who initiated this topic. I wouldn’t have posted it if you didn’t. And if you did not care, why did you post that? I am obviously not talking to myself since you posted that idiotic post. And if the original topic poster did not care, why did he make this topic then?<br>
Look, if I don’t care, and if you don’t care, then we are in agreement. Stop flaming. There is no argument here. You might just end up flaming more than my friend is flaming. Please contribute to the topic, and if you can’t, and have anything negative to say, keep to to yourself, no one cares. Look 'Aaron, you are the one with the problem. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. You have not lived my life. My experiences are different than yours. You think slightly differently. You do not agree with me. You know nothing about my life and experiences. Keep Quiet, who cares. Gut Zu Wissen? Guten.  I have not said anything bad about you ever, so why do this for me?<br>
Ich danken jeder hasst mich hier nur weil ich bin Deutsch…</p>

You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about &amp; shut up about windows 98, you don’t deserve to talk about its awesome-ness.<br>

No, I do not know enough about linux to really talk about it, I said that. ( I think I was like 12-ish when I did use Linux…it was all very new to me back then …and have not really been able to do anything with it since.)</p>
<p>Windows 98 is a great OS …I do not know what you are talking about =P ( Besides, the blue screen of death is a rare experience &amp; not much of an inconvenience for me lol, just restart. Usually only came up when I did something wrong XD )</p>
<p>‘You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about &amp; shut up about windows 98.’</p>
<p>I do not think you have any clue what you are talking about… I do not think you know anything about me, and my personal experiences with computers.<br>
Mac OS 9.2 was sh** for me, and barely loaded anything, and was slow as sh** The Mac OS 9.2’s got regular maintaining &amp; hardware cleaning /vacuuming. My Windows 98 machine on the other hand ,  never got cleaned, and was dusty as ****… it should of went up in flames from the dust clogging up the hardware. Same specs for both.  The Windows 98 computer ran faster, loaded things better…and is also the better OS. Mac only beat Windows 98 with their OS X =P</p>
<p>Please don’t flame…if you have something very negative to say, do not say it…but I won’t stop you if you do decide to do something so pointless…</p>
<p>Oh well. If you say something about Windows someone will bound to flame at you for mentioning it if they likez teh Mac =P</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">‘the mac is just for looks’</span></p>
<p>Oh come on, give it more credit than that , at least it works right? It does look really cool though. ( Which is why some people decided to make a Mac OS toolbar for Windows…you know the one at the bottom of the screen which hosts your icons and programs and such .Their just jealous of the Mac’s cool looks and wished they had a Mac for it’s cool looks, so imported one to Windows.)<br>

<p>That is so…sweetly…sweet. I cannot descibe the amount of epic there. I didn’t even know laptops were made when windows 3.1 was out? That is sooo cool  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"> Most Epic.[/quote]</p>

You want me to give it more ‘credit’ than that, yet you cannot find one reason why (nor have you stated) it is not just good for looks, downloading, and web surfing.</p>

<p>PRICE IS NOT AN ISSUE OSX IS COOL[/quote]</p>
<p>Right. OSX ist good &amp; cool. OS 9.2 is sh** , buggy &amp; crashes alot. Seriously, never get Mac OS 9.2…my old school had it, and it was not very good. Windows 98 is much better than Mac OS 9.2, more stable …faster… so if you want to get an older OS for some reason, if you even consider Mac OS 9.2 ( i’ll shoot you { JK , or am I? …Hmm… }  ), don’t get Mac OS 9.2, instead just get Windows 98.<br>
…But anyways Mac OS X is really good.<br>
I find linux kinda hard to use, then again only used it three times, so never had time to get used to it. I tried downloading and installing a game, but it would not let me, and gave me some roller thing ( might of been a winzip alternative, but it did this for all files, and wouldn’t let me do anything…)<br>
I like windows the best though. Been using it since windows 3.2 ( if you find that hard to believe? ) my old elementary school had some because they couldn’t afford the newer windows 95/98 lol. Out of all the OS’s though, I like windows 98 the best XD , windows 7 is second =P</p>
