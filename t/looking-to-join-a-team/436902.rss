    <title>Looking to join a team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-join-a-team/436902</link>
    <description>Hello,
I&#39;m looking to join a team which has something to offer me in return for what I offer them(lets be honest, I don&#39;t do things out the good of my heart however nobody said it has to be financial;3).
My experience with Rsps has been over 3 years, only one year should be counted however as for two years my knowledge was basic at best.
My Java knowledge isn&#39;t huge, its very small in fact. My strengths are web design(as we all know thats typically easy unless your making scripts for the site) and my logical thought process for idea&#39;s to be implemented. My weaknesses is that unless I understand how I&#39;m wrong  I&#39;ll continue with what I&#39;m doing regardless otherwise unless I&#39;m told how its wrong. My lack of programming skills.
I&#39;m learning Java at the moment in my course and I&#39;m about to apply for my next course which is http://www.stevenson.ac.uk/courses/course/hnc-computer-games-development-1213-course?fs=1 so I can only get better which I can provide proof of.
I will develop my skills over time, just be patient.
If your intrested please do leave a post. I communicate via Msn but I&#39;m willing to use Skype but I don&#39;t use it too often.</description>

I know that there scripts that work with websites thats why I said there scripts and we were talking about websites so thats pretty obvious?<br>
Well you should check the defination of design and development as there two different things although some of the things overlap. Thats like saying doing graphics(including some implementation) and doing programming are the same things?</p>

jscript et is what I’d classify as scripts also I believe php is a scripting language(I don’t use php but I was told that from a friend thats why I’ve stayed away from it).<br>
Web design and web development are two different things. Design is aimed at aesthetics, development is aimed at development obviously.</p>

<p>Website Development is only simple if you’re using something like html.</p>
<p>If you’re going from scratch and creating a good site, you need to make use of jscript or jquery, css and then as an extension of html. If you’re using it as a script then there’s php in there as well, there’s not much simple about Website Development.</p>

<p>Sweet, I’ve never worked on Hyperion so you’ll have to bear with me as I get to grips with it :p. I can promise to do my best, it’ll be productive of course as it’ll be the best that I can do as of that time and I can only get better over time as its in my course and it’ll be in my next course. I’d really like to work with you as I’ve seen some of your work and it looks pretty nice and theres a lot you can teach me. I’ve added your msn(:.</p>
