    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-that-connects-to-any-ip/262149</link>
    <description>currently im using silabs web client too conenct too my server and look at what ive coded in, silabs does not show coords though, and it does not show all new items, i also get dcs from my delta source base every so ofent so so id appreciate it if someone could link me too a client that will connect too any ip? please dont link me too your client for your server as most owners will add a code preventing you too connect too any server.

thanks.</description>
