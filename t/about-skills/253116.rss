    <description>I&#39;m not sure if this is the feedback section cause if it aint I&#39;m not sure if mopar even has a feedback section but I would like your feedback.

Would you play a server with just these skills? Because I dont want to change my source, I&#39;ve worked on it so much.
Do you think I should keep it the way it is or should I just get a new source and transfer my work rather then spending all the time coding each one of the non working skills.

-Working Skills-

Attack works fine
Strength works fine
Defence works fine
Range works fine
Magic works fine
Health works fine - food doesn&#39;t exist on server.
Thieving works fine
Crafting works - not used that often.
Fletching works fine
Mining works fine
Smelting works fine - smithing has been disabled because of bad duplication bug.
Firemaking works - doesn&#39;t create fire but still gives exp
Woodcutting works fine

-Non Working Skills-

Prayer gives xp but still doesn&#39;t work. This doesn&#39;t matter on most dodian servers including the original dodian.

RuneCrafting normally doesn&#39;t work.

Agility normally doesn&#39;t work.

Herblore is a pointless skill.

Slayer doesn&#39;t work - pointless on private servers.

Smithing has been disabled because of bad duplication bug. - Smelting still works. -.-

Fishing has been removed - pointless on private servers.

Cooking has been removed - food doesn&#39;t work.

Farming doesn&#39;t work - the most pointless skill of all.

Thanks ~Torax</description>

              <p>it might not be a bad server add some pics of how it could be cool but really go to server downloads and you will ask yourself why anyone would play mine when they have every working skill mini game emote and everything else so it might not be to bad to play but to get people not likely…ps add some dam food</p>
