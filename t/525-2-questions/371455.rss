    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/525-2-questions/371455</link>
    <description>1. I wanted to change the starting location of my 525 RSPS. As I&#39;m new to 525s I looked for it in player.java but, can&#39;t find the coords and I don&#39;t know the method used. This might be a bit NEWBIE, but please help me. Tell me where is it? And if its in player.java, then what is method or statement used?

2. How to make it that my player can attack more than 0 (i.e. 1) at lowest starting stats. Help!

Will REP++ you if you helped.</description>
