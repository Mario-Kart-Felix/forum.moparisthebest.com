    <description>I DIDN&#39;T MAKE THIS MYSELF. I AM JUST TRYING TO HELP OUT AND STOP THE THREADS ABOUT THE PICKUP COMMAND!



[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;pickup&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 2)) {
     try {
     String[] token = command.split(&quot; &quot;);
     int newItemID = Integer.parseInt(token[1]);
     int newItemAmount = Integer.parseInt(token[2]);
          if (newItemID &lt;= 20000 &amp;&amp; newItemID &gt;= 0) {
               addItem(newItemID, newItemAmount);
          } else {
               sendMessage(&quot;That won&#39;t work...&quot;);
          }
     } catch(Exception e) {
          sendMessage(&quot;Nice work...! &quot;);
     }
}[/code]



I hope this helps.. Please stop posting about pickup command now please people  ;D</description>
