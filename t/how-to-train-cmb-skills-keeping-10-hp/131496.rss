    <title>How to train cmb skills keeping 10 hp</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-train-cmb-skills-keeping-10-hp/131496</link>
    <description>well as you know some pures like low hp but high other skills because when they get hp to lvl they will be lower lvl with higher skills... well thats how i think about it... anyways basically you can get up to 30 attk 30 str up to 99 range and up to 99 mage depending on your cash keep 10 hp :)

Mage Training - members guide (I dont have a f2p guide yet although you can do this guide without using cammy telly)

Well, for mage training you will need runes. Depending on how rich you are this varies. I normally end up spending anywhere from 1m to 10m on getting mage up. It all depends on what lvl you want to go for. Now basically its simple first of all you want to cast wind strike until you get lvl 3 mage dont go any higher or you may get hp. After you get 3 mage start casting confuse in full iron. (do this in full iron so you splash more often because you will get exp for splashing). Use confuse until you can use weaken. Then use weaken until you can use curse, and then use curse until you can do varrock teleport. Once you can do varrock teleport, start tellying until you have 31 mage then use lumby teleport. Once you get 37 mage you can use falador teleport then when you get 45 mage use cammy telly until you have 55 mage. Once you have 55 mage start using high level alchemy. Then just use High level alchemy until your desired lvl. I did this on both of my dt pures :) one did dt at 36 cmb the other did it at 42 cmb. (both had other skills which gave me 35ish hp.)

Range Training - members guide (you cant have 10 hp with high range and be f2p)

Well for this you will need a cannon and alot of cannon balls. Now for This you can train in several places. You will also need to do Dwarf Cannon quest to use the cannon. Now you can train on experiments which means you will have to start and do some of Creature of Fenkenstrain. and just put your cannon up and start ranging with just the cannon. It will get really boring after a while so if you wanna dare to macro its a pretty good thing to do. Just set it to refil the cannon every like 5 minutes or so and check on your computer every once in a while to make sure you dont have a random. You can also train on Rock Crabs north of camelot with the cannon. You can train from 1 - 99 range using a cannon and having 10 hp. once you have a desired range lvl just go and hide behind random stuff and range things for hp until you are the cmb lvl you want to be. this is also what I did when i made my hybrid pures.

Strength and Attack training - members only

You have to do a members only quest in order to get strength and attack exp. That quest is the Waterfall quest. It is really annoying to do on a 10 hp account because you can get 1 hit in the quest a few times. Bring food like lobs which heal 12 or tuna which heal 10, you can also use trout or salmon which work and are cheaper. Now just do the quest and there you go.

Uses of a 10 hp character

well there are not many uses for a character like this it is fun to show off to people because you have a high cmb skill at such a low lvl. The only way to make this usefull is to get high mage/range then use it and get 40-50 hp... as in high range/mage i mean like 80+ range and 82+ mage with 50-55 hp. This really good for staking especially if you have done dt and want to mage stake. If you mage stake you can mage stake people higher lvl then you with lower mage and get them to 2x or up to 5x you. This is what I did on my dt pure and i would stake 100k and win 500k :). Pking is a different story because it is annoying because you eat more. The good thing though is that if you hit you will barely eat because you hit higher and more often. So it evens out in the end. I have done this with almost every pure I have ever made and it is very useful.

and this is the end of my guide...</description>

              <p>Top tip: If you have a 10hp character and go to pest control, you can chop wood and repair barracades. Each barracade counts for 5 damage, and you can use the points on attack and strength, whilst keeping 10hp <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>i know i said salmon is cheaper… but tuna and lobsters are easier to buy… like i have 15k lobs (5k lobs on 3 accounts all banned for bug abusing -.-) but i dont have any salmon at all… because there harder to come across lol</p>

              <p>well as you know some pures like low hp but high other skills because when they get hp to lvl they will be lower lvl with higher skills… well thats how i think about it… anyways basically you can get up to 30 attk 30 str up to 99 range and up to 99 mage depending on your cash keep 10 hp <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Mage Training - members guide (I dont have a f2p guide yet although you can do this guide without using cammy telly)</p>
<p>Well, for mage training you will need runes. Depending on how rich you are this varies. I normally end up spending anywhere from 1m to 10m on getting mage up. It all depends on what lvl you want to go for. Now basically its simple first of all you want to cast wind strike until you get lvl 3 mage dont go any higher or you may get hp. After you get 3 mage start casting confuse in full iron. (do this in full iron so you splash more often because you will get exp for splashing). Use confuse until you can use weaken. Then use weaken until you can use curse, and then use curse until you can do varrock teleport. Once you can do varrock teleport, start tellying until you have 31 mage then use lumby teleport. Once you get 37 mage you can use falador teleport then when you get 45 mage use cammy telly until you have 55 mage. Once you have 55 mage start using high level alchemy. Then just use High level alchemy until your desired lvl. I did this on both of my dt pures <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> one did dt at 36 cmb the other did it at 42 cmb. (both had other skills which gave me 35ish hp.)</p>
<p>Range Training - members guide (you cant have 10 hp with high range and be f2p)</p>
<p>Well for this you will need a cannon and alot of cannon balls. Now for This you can train in several places. You will also need to do Dwarf Cannon quest to use the cannon. Now you can train on experiments which means you will have to start and do some of Creature of Fenkenstrain. and just put your cannon up and start ranging with just the cannon. It will get really boring after a while so if you wanna dare to macro its a pretty good thing to do. Just set it to refil the cannon every like 5 minutes or so and check on your computer every once in a while to make sure you dont have a random. You can also train on Rock Crabs north of camelot with the cannon. You can train from 1 - 99 range using a cannon and having 10 hp. once you have a desired range lvl just go and hide behind random stuff and range things for hp until you are the cmb lvl you want to be. this is also what I did when i made my hybrid pures.</p>
<p>Strength and Attack training - members only</p>
<p>You have to do a members only quest in order to get strength and attack exp. That quest is the Waterfall quest. It is really annoying to do on a 10 hp account because you can get 1 hit in the quest a few times. Bring food like lobs which heal 12 or tuna which heal 10, you can also use trout or salmon which work and are cheaper. Now just do the quest and there you go.</p>
<p>Uses of a 10 hp character</p>
<p>well there are not many uses for a character like this it is fun to show off to people because you have a high cmb skill at such a low lvl. The only way to make this usefull is to get high mage/range then use it and get 40-50 hp… as in high range/mage i mean like 80+ range and 82+ mage with 50-55 hp. This really good for staking especially if you have done dt and want to mage stake. If you mage stake you can mage stake people higher lvl then you with lower mage and get them to 2x or up to 5x you. This is what I did on my dt pure and i would stake 100k and win 500k :). Pking is a different story because it is annoying because you eat more. The good thing though is that if you hit you will barely eat because you hit higher and more often. So it evens out in the end. I have done this with almost every pure I have ever made and it is very useful.</p>
<p>and this is the end of my guide…</p>
