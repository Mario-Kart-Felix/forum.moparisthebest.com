    <title>What port # do you forward? Fast reply would be nice</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-port-do-you-forward-fast-reply-would-be-nice/9621</link>
    <description>Im not asking how to port forward. I know how. But what port # are you forwarding? 43594, or something else? Ive tried 53494, and I still cant get in. BTW, I have testscape, and the private server tut I saw gave me the code to put in my compile.bat for nixscape. Will the nixscape thing work for testscape? Or do I need to use the CheezeScape one.

Any help appreciated. Thanks.
