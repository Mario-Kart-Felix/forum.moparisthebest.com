              <p>Have you tried rebooting your computer, or closing any programs that may be using port 43594? there are some applications that use the port such as music players, torrents etc, you can also change the port of the client and server to 5555 (I doubt you wanna do that though :P), as I said a little way up in my post, try rebooting your computer and look for programs that may be using the port 43594</p>
<p>P.S.<br>
Stop creating so many topics.</p>
