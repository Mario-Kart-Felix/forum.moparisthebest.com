    <title>Need major help with my server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-major-help-with-my-server/182873</link>
    <description>Ok, so my server is czar based.  Accually right now, that is all it is.  I haven&#39;t edited anything, mostly cause I don&#39;t know how to.  

EDIT: this part fixed!

some more questions:
in order to keep my server up, do I have to leave the source file thing running all the time?

I also don&#39;t know how to edit the info menu or what it says when u log in.  

Oh, btw, I tried to register my server on the server status page, but it said it was offline, but I can get on just fine.....

If you can help me, i&#39;ll make you a trial admin/mod, meaning that you will be a(n) admin/mod for a period of time, then based on what you did, decided whether to keep you at that spot or drop you back down to a regular player(highly unlikey!).

I am looking to make this server PWNAGE in all ways possible!! there will be great fortune awaiting you if you help me.</description>

<p>If thats the case you will not be able to get on.</p>
<p>And you also do have to change your server otherwise it is considered leaching because you did not “make” the source, your only using it as a base… Kinda like a pizza lolz  ;D</p>

              <p>One of the reasons you may be experiencing not being able to register your server is that you cant do that unless you know your own Ip address (I would recommend using a No-Ip address other than your own) or as I said a No-Ip address.</p>
<p>Once you have done that you will be able to register your server and other people will be able to join.</p>
