    <description>Has anybody played any of the series? I snatched the ultimate edition of Origins a while back on Steam and overall it&#39;s a fun game. I think it would be pretty awesome with co-op. Thoughts on the series/a specific game? Who is your favorite character? How many hours do you have in game so far? 

Anybody pre-ordered inquisition yet?</description>

If you ever get a chance/or get your own copy I suggest to try it on the PC the gameplay with pausing feature is totally different and makes you the ultimate tactician.</p>

              <p>Loved the first game, the game play was simple and the story line kept you interested. Didn’t like how after finishing the last quest line you couldn’t play anymore, was a disappointment. I spent roughly 30 hours playing i think, between trying to finish the story line and getting the characters to like me. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I heard the second game was terrible, though i haven’t played it. However, apparently the newest one coming out will be amazing.</p>
