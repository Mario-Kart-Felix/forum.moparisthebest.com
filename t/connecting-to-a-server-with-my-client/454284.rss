    <title>Connecting to a server with my client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-to-a-server-with-my-client/454284</link>
    <description>Hello Moparscape. I&#39;m currently developing a Cheat Client.
I understand that people would rather use reflection clients, mostly because of compatibility, which is actually my issue.
I prefer not to use reflection clients, because now a days most big servers have obfsucated clients, and I believe reflecting 
an obfuscated client is a lot more work than just finding the UID.

Anyways, I found a pretty big server that I wanted to test my cheat client on, so I decompiled the client and got the UID.
The UID was correct, but when I logged in, I was stuck in this frame:

[img]http://i.imgur.com/xxBvz.png[/img]

My screen is stuck like this virtually forever.
No errors print out, telling me that it&#39;s not the sendCrashFrame method.

The client I&#39;m using is standard InsidiaX, and the server I&#39;m connecting to seems to be InsidiaX based as well, with a few extra customs.
I&#39;m not sure if this is a cache problem, or if it&#39;s some sort of server-sided check that I&#39;m not aware of.

Anyone have an idea on how to bypass it?</description>

<p>Read the original post, I already got the UID, and it is valid. I never said I had any trouble finding the server’s UID.</p>
