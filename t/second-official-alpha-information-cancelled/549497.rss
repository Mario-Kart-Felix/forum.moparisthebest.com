    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/second-official-alpha-information-cancelled/549497</link>
    <description>[s][i]This alpha test will be available Saturday, February 7th, 2015 ([url=http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20150207T13&amp;p0=234&amp;msg=Official+Alpha+%232&amp;csz=1&amp;swk=1]Countdown[/url])[/i][/s]

[hr]

Thank you for your interest in the MoparScape official server! Soon we will be launching the second and [i]last[/i] alpha before we move to the beta stages. Accounts from the previous alpha will be reset, and they will be reset after this one, but now is your chance to get a taste of how the official server will work when it gets closer to real launch day!

[size=18pt][b]The server is currently: OFFLINE[/b][/size]

[size=14pt][u][b]Client Information[/b][/u][/size]
The version of the RuneScape we are using for the server is [b]530[/b]. This is based in[b] January, 2009[/b]; almost exactly 6 years ago. We apologize if you were expecting an &#39;older&#39; version.

[u][b]Loading the client[/b][/u]

Playing the game should be as simple as going to the [b]webclient[/b]. The webclient supports HD (but not fullscreen) for most platforms.
[b][i][url=http://game.moparisthebest.com]WEBCLIENT LINK[/url][/i][/b]
[size=8pt]Because of changes to Java security defaults, you may need to go to your Java settings (in your OS control panel), security tab, and then either change your security level to medium or add our site to your whitelist. [i][url=http://puu.sh/ekMbD/385f321618.png]Picture instructions[/url] [/i][/size]

If this still doesn&#39;t work for you, you can use the [b]downloadable client[/b]. 
[i][b][url=http://game.moparisthebest.com/moparscape_client.jar]DOWNLOAD LINK[/url][/b][/i]
[size=8pt]Note that the downloadable client does not support HD unless you download the JOGL binaries yourself and put them in your cache folder.[/size]

[u][b]Logging in[/b][/u]
For alpha, all registration is done in the client. When your client loads up, simply click on &#39;Create Account&#39; and follow the steps. 
Notes:

[ul][li]You must change your birth year to be 13 years of age or older.[/li]
[li]While the client text boxes allow special characters, they are not sent to the server and may cause your client to crash excessively when attempting to log in. It is suggested to follow the alphanumeric and underscore protocol for best success.[/li]
[li]If you cannot log in, post a bug report with the username(s) you attempted to use, your computer specs (OS/browser especially), and your java version.[/li][/ul]


[size=14pt][u][b]Game Information[/b][/u][/size]

Though the main purpose of this alpha is to just test the server on a larger scale than the private alpha, there is still content for people to explore and test! A lot of the basic skills are functional and most of Varrock/Lumbridge/Al Kharid spawns are complete (no NPC drops yet though except chickens for feathers for Fletching). We invite you to peruse the content we have done and suggest what content should be highest priority to add.


[size=14pt][u][b]Reporting Issues/Bugs/Missing content[/b][/u][/size]
Every issue you have can go in either a new thread or in [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=667957]this topic[/url]. If you post a new thread, it will likely be examined and then moved to the linked topic. Please feel free to post about anything we are missing or that you&#39;d like to see added to the server.</description>

<p>I’ll think about this over the next couple days and decide whether or not to move forward with this alpha test or to wait and do it all at once with a more long term testing phase. Feel free to send me PMs with your opinions on the various topics brought up in the thread, but I’ll be locking this topic in the meantime.</p>

The thing is, there’s no reason to introduce variables and increase the scope of the alpha test when it isn’t required. If people can spawn items for example, it may not be clear to someone that a piece of content is missing to acquire those items.[/quote]</p>
<p>you have added no npc drops or anything and you expect the content to be tested without spawning? stop being no stubborn and just give the ability to test the content to its full extent in the given timeframe.<br>
[/quote]This… Also, if this is supposed to be a <span class="bbcode-i">community</span> server and most people are on-board for a better way of communicating with everyone for testing, shouldn’t the  majority win?[/quote]That’s the thing – there is so limited content that you don’t need to teleport around or spawn items to test anything. There are no bosses, high level npcs, or anything high level added to the game at all, really. That’s why it’s going for one day. The alpha tests are to test the CORE of the server, and testing content is just an added extra part of it. There were a lot of bugs with the core previously, so that’s why we’re doing another alpha test before moving forward.</p>
<p>For example, some new things to test will be:<br>
NPC drops (and ground items in general)<br>
Fixed bugs (listed in a different topic, especially things like the combat “area” math)<br>
Fixed login crash</p>
<p>This could all be tested in the span of a couple hours total. People can stay logged in as long as they want to continue playing what little content we have if they want, but I dont feel obligated to cater to it.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lin, post:39, topic:549497”]This… Also, if this is supposed to be a <span class="bbcode-i">community</span> server and most people are on-board for a better way of communicating with everyone for testing, shouldn’t the  majority win?[/quote]Everyone in the mopardev IRC channel is saying they don’t see the need for a yell command.</p>
<p>Honestly, the only thing you guys are making me reconsider is that we should wait longer for the next alpha so that there’s a lot more content to test and then do it all at once. If people would prefer that, I can cancel this one. It would be completely fine with me, I was just getting a lot of messages from people asking when the server would be playable again so I assumed people wanted another taste soon.</p>

In my eyes it’s as simple as “hey I need help testing trading at duel arena, pm me”. If people are unable to test content because they can’t send more than one global message every 30-60 seconds, maybe they should wait for beta or official launch because I doubt they will be getting much done with that sort of disability.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>not to say you are wrong but I would probably use the yell command when I need assistance from others to break things. I would want more than 1 yell per minute to actually get someone to walk to me. I mean its an alpha how does a yell or teleports actually hurt anything? Hell how would giving every player admin hurt anything.<br>
[/quote]I was actually discussing with the IRC channel today about whether to give everyone certain admin powers such as spawning items, etc. The thing is, there’s no reason to introduce variables and increase the scope of the alpha test when it isn’t required. If people can spawn items for example, it may not be clear to someone that a piece of content is missing to acquire those items. Let’s pretend the friends list or clan chat had a bug in it, but nobody was using it because they had access to infinite yells. How would we find the problem in alpha? I want to keep the alpha as close to the real game as possible while still coming up with compromises to help people do their testing. Having alpha be completely different than beta kinda defeats the purpose.</p>
<p>As suggested, telling people to PM you in your yell should serve pretty well. If not, you can yell again in 30-60 seconds, which isn’t really that long. Teleports I might be more lenient on, perhaps allow teleporting to players once every couple minutes and then lower the free teleport time for normal spellbook teleports to just a minute.[/quote]</p>
<p>why wouldn’t people test things like that? thats exactly the reason people are logging in for… revoke item spawning if you want but you should allow people the ability to get to places, communicate, and experience content with ease not attempt to restrict them.</p>

I would want more than 1 yell per minute to actually get someone to walk to me. I mean its an alpha how does a yell or teleports actually hurt anything? Hell how would giving every player admin hurt anything.</p>

In my eyes it’s as simple as “hey I need help testing trading at duel arena, pm me”.

              <p>is it a crime to check your client to see the different variations to the text frame?</p>
<p>as per the 400-500 text engine (mostly used in “317s” nowadays) the only avaiable options i can remember are , , <img>, <br>, , , and the ONLY options available to create a packet structure for requests are :chalreq:  :duelreq:  :tradereq:</p>
<p>and if you are seriously considering limiting teleports/transportation to every 2-3 minutes and not allowing access to a readily available communication platform simply because you cant be bothered to find the cause of the problem or simply filter out the few possible things/not attempt to generate a packet for trades/duels/challenges unless its an actual player and not an entire string. why should the alpha even be available?</p>
<p>nobody seriously wants to walk everywhere/test things that way.</p>
<p>i suggest making a list of all content that you believe needs to be tested and either assigning specific parts to members of the alpha or allowing the list to be public ane the users testing what they want.</p>
<p>i suggest easy access to global communication whether it be yelling/global chat system such as how dungeoneering does it (because im fairly certain that the requests and options are not even processed in the chat packet but only the text frame) and also an easy to navigate feature whether it be teletabs/teleport spells etc.</p>

I listed the systems that aren’t in place that I would want if I was going to add a yell command.</p>
<p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:21, topic:549497”]Why would it take a couple of hours? I don’t get that. Add a character limit and simple filter and then it works just like the chat, but globally…[/quote]It doesn’t work like chat at all. Chat is filtered client sided, and isn’t used to parse special codes like the server messages are that you see with the yell command. To moderate yell I’d need to work on the filter, and then I’d have to decide how to do mutes, bans, command logs to know who to mute and ban, etc…</p>
<p>[quote=“imthenull, post:22, topic:549497”]LMAO @ crashing with a global chat command. If your server can’t even handle a few people using such command, then you’re screwed.[/quote]It’s a crash related to how the client parses the different codes sent from the server. For example, a server message with " :tradereq:"gives the pink text that the player can click on. If the player name isn’t there (ie, ::yell :tradereq:), it will crash all clients that get the message. It has literally nothing to do with the server being able to “handle” commands, 500 people could yell at once and it wouldn’t matter if they were just doing normal text. Hence why players aren’t given access to said commands usually, and why I’d need to add a filter if they were.</p>
<p>If people want the yell command, I could enable it with the understanding that if it gets abused I am disabling it. I’m not going to spend time right now working on systems to moderate/filter it when I’m already stretched for time as it is.</p>

Okay, then still, I don’t see how a temporary command hurts the alpha.<br>
Whether they’re added perm or not.<br>

I get you don’t want to deal with it, but I don’t see where/how yelling would cause crashes, honestly.</p>

The command system is already in place, isn't it?
And you/sini were doing some type of yelling or global chat on the server. Because I'd get messages when you weren't in area... So all you'd have to do is extend it to everyone.
<blockquote>I'd rather not spend a couple hours making sure a yell command can't be abused so that people can socialize easier for a one day alpha, if that makes sense.</blockquote>
Why would it take a couple of hours? I don't get that. Add a character limit and simple filter and then it works just like the chat, but globally...

              <p>[quote=“Zymus, post:15, topic:549497”]I think the long term solution in that case would be to figure what causes the crash, and prevent it server side. If the cause is that text &gt;= 120 characters crashes the client, have the server truncate the last n characters after 120 have been reached. If it’s because of adding characters outside of the scope (ie. Cyrillic characters in en_US locale) then you can simply iterate through the message once, remove any non-valid characters, and push that.</p>
<p>Note that I don’t like yell commands (I find them annoying), and I’m not advocating for them.[/quote]There are various things people can do to crash clients (such as sending things like :chalreq:, :tradereq:, etc), and I’m not sure what all of them are. In the long run if we were going to have a yell command for public use then yeah I would make sure I did everything to clean the input, but I don’t want to put time into something that I don’t plan on implementing.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lin, post:16, topic:549497”]So… Let me get this straight. Rather than allowing people to explore all of the features you’ve implemented, test everything, and still communicate without having to switch windows to talk to everyone at once <span class="bbcode-b">just so the chat box stays cluster-free</span>, you’d rather most the people huddle in Lumbridge, test almost nothing, and still fill the chat box with their messages? Makes no sense.[/quote]I don’t see how not allowing people to yell stops people from exploring features? If you need to communicate with people, why can’t you add them in game? If there is a good reason to implement it, I could do something similar to teleports with allowing one message per minute or something if people want to announce “hey come to varrock to help me test X” or w/e</p>
<p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:17, topic:549497”]I don’t see how a temporary command could really hurt the alpha test…</p>
<p>I mean, we plan to have commands in it in the first place. You could call it stress testing.[/quote]Actually, we don’t plan to have commands for public use.</p>
