    <title>Need help with few commands(exrendum source)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-few-commands-exrendum-source/301654</link>
    <description>If someone could make a few commands for me then tell me where i should add them so they will work.

First i want 1 to do ::hail like the normal 1 where they like bow down to you saying hail (persons name)

also i want a command when i say ::bla they say we love playing this server!(something like that)

id appreciate it and if you could also tell me where to add them in like what spot.


Another thing is im using exrendum source and for the bounty hunter i need to know where to go to change the pvp drops in there. Also sometimes u lose stuff so if you could tell me what to change to make sure u dont lose anything.

- thanks marcbob</description>
