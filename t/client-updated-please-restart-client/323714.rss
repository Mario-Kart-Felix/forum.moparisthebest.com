    <title>Client updated - please restart client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-updated-please-restart-client/323714</link>
    <description>Okay, I know this may not be the right section but:

I followed Ric914&#39;s tutorial on how to make a webclient and I did it exactly how he said 15 times. Many other people get the same error I do (Client Updated - Please restart client). This is only in my browser, but if I run the client.jar directly from my desktop it works fine.

When others posted this error, ric never helped them but he helped other people. Does anyone know the solution to this problem?</description>
