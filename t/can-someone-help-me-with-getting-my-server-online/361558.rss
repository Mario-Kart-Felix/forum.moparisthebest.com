    <title>Can Someone Help Me With Getting My Server Online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-help-me-with-getting-my-server-online/361558</link>
    <description>Hey guys my server used to be online for awhile a year or two.. Then my router crashed and fucked me up the ass... I got a new one, took some time getting into my Default Gateway host to portforward, but anyway, i did it, Got in and i believe ive portforwarded PERFECTLY but, still no one can connect to the server, and it&#39;s getting annoying, if theres someone out there that has T.V that could help me, please leave a message or add me on MSN PLEASE!! if helped i will give you Co-Owner on server if you want it.. 


I&#39;m using evolution-X source, but i know it works, because ive seen like 500 diffferent servers with that base..Im not new to all this to be honest, but this has just blown my mind.. I&#39;ll tell you where i&#39;ve started from.

-I&#39;ve portforwarded perfectly (so I believe)

-Dont think these have a role, but my enviormental variables are good, like CLASSPATH &amp; PATH are perfect.

-Server&#39;s running with No-Ip and I have my ip in the client for others to connect, even tried my exact IP address instead of the no-ip.org.

-Tried many clients over and over again.

-I can connect with 127.0.0.0 or whatever, or localhost. (but no one can connect to my server other than me.)
