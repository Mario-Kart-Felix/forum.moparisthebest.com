    <description>Okay so First off, when i went to Jar my client I had to do it through excel. Jarmaker wasn&#39;t working for me so I right clicked and exported my client. Everyone can go on the client.jar just fine, I have people on right now and had them on for weeks. However, when I use this client without signing it (not even sure if excel did automatically) it comes up as this:

Note: In order to open the jar i had to replace MANIFEST.TM with a release I found on a snipet


And so I tried signing it with jarmaker but this came up..

Thanks so much for any feedback!</description>
