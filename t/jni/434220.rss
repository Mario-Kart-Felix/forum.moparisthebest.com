    <description>I have a question regarding the Java Native Interface. I am currently working on a project where i am converting the graphics of a game that&#39;s written in Java, to C++. Why would I do this? Merely just a learning experience.

But my question is, would rending the graphics actually be faster using Java? What I plan on doing is simply requesting that C++ return an Image object that will be displayed using AWT. I may also be moving the networking portion of the game over to C++ as well.</description>

              <p>It would probably be faster with Java only if you are sticking with AWT. If you decide to move to using opengl or direct blitting, the native rendering will be much to significantly faster. AWT has a lot of overhead and its pipeline is far from simple.</p>
<p>What exactly are you trying to get out of this project? Do you want to learn how to write native applications, or just how to learn the Java Native Interface? I understand if this comes on as a dimwitted question, but I think it’s pertinent. In my opinion, there are better ways of learning JNI than just porting some Java application over to native code with some intermediary interface functions. JNI is mostly used for utilizing native libraries in Java, and it has little use beyond that. You really should only use it to access functions Java can’t directly, or to optimize functions that Java can’t execute fast enough (which nowadays, is very little).</p>
<p>Maybe if you separated the game into pieces including a generic game library/engine and then the actual implementation code, then convert the engine portion to native code and use JNI to implement it with the content code. It’s just a suggestion, but I think it would help you understand the uses of JNI far better.</p>
<p>Goodluck. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>yes.</p>

<p>From what i’m aware of, you can construct objects using Java’s libraries in c++</p>
