    <description>Hey guys,
I&#39;m currently using a Project Insanity blank source. I&#39;ve reduced lag about as much as I can think. I just want your preferences on decreasing server load a lot more.

What I&#39;ve currently done:
  - Competely recoded the NPC system and how it finds/loads NPC&#39;s
  - Took a lot of stuff outta process and made them in events &quot;ModifiedCycleEventManager&quot;
  - Fixed deadlocks
  - Recoded unnecessary loops
  - Etc.

This is currently what I&#39;m at and i think it still sucks.
[code][5/20/13 12:53 PM]: Average Cycle Time: 2ms
[5/20/13 12:53 PM]: Players online: 1, engine load: 0.33%[/code]

Any ideas? Flame if you want. Any criticism will be good for me. So i know what I did good/bad. 

- Thanks</description>
