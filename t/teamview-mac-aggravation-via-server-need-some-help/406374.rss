    <description>If someone could assist me with team viewer i will be more than grateful, I&#39;m trying to get my server up and running but i can&#39;t seem to connect with a different computer. i&#39;m almost positive that the port forwarding is accurate, i&#39;m using Transmission i&#39;ve also tried setting myself as the Local DMZ host for my Verizon Router. If someone helps me trouble shoot this it&#39;s a promised co or mod position. Feel free to PM me or reply to this post, thanks in advance.</description>
