    <title>How can I get more players to my server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-get-more-players-to-my-server/364014</link>
    <description>Hello, in the past 2 months I have been developing a server.  I have paid for VPS and had many recent updates.  We have a moparscape voting page and runelocus page, the players we have (at most 11 players online the webclient at once) are all voting.  But no traffic is coming to my server.  

I am very new to rsps, but was wandering how any other server owners gained players, please let me know :)

thanks</description>

<li>May be because of the content and how you’ve made everything. Maybe most people didn’t like it’s style.</li>
<li>Advertise in all communities’ status pages.</li>
<li>Maybe your server isn’t that stable and the most it gets is 11-20 like i used to once.</li>
<li>…Well i think those are it.</li>
