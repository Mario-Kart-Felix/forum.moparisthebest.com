    <title>Why do &quot;null&quot;&#39;s keep logging in to my server? what are they? :O</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-do-null-s-keep-logging-in-to-my-server-what-are-they-o/278173</link>
    <description>Please help!!

Can anyone tell me what a &quot;null&quot; is when it logs in to my server? The longer it&#39;s online the more seem to build up... If i do ::players in-game it counts them as players, but when i kick the server and reboot they disappear. Clienthandler also says &quot;accepted from blah blah ip&quot; ... but nobody actually logs into the server.

Are these hackers or bots or some sort of system thing? or what? :)

Thanks for your help :)</description>
