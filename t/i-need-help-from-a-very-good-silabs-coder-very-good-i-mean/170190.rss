    <description>Im looking at deleting the ::skillcapes and things from my server. I am looking to make it so that when you get 99 in each skill you automatically get the skillcape in that skill.

I HAVE SEEN THIS ON SERVERS BEFORE. DONT SAY ITS NOT POSSABLE.


I would also like to add Black Partyhats to my server. Dont say any of this isn&#39;t possable I have seen them all before.

I am also looking to make the xp amount you get from clicking on the statues and prayer alters in the server less. Its too easy to max out. 

Can anyone here help me?</description>
