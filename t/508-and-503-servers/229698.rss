    <title>508 and 503 servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-and-503-servers/229698</link>
    <description>How do I edit one?  I&#39;m not a Java n00b, but I&#39;m used to the whole client.java setup.

I want to upgrade my server to a 508, or 503.  But, like I said, I can&#39;t figure out where you edit the commands and stuff.</description>

Okay, as you asked nicely, I’m going to tell you how to do this (although I doubt you’ll be able to do any of it):</p>
<ol>
<li>You’ll need to deobfuscate and decompile the runescape client jar (if you have a decompiled, deobfuscated jar then ignore this step) [I will not tell you how to do this]</li>
<li>You’ll have to nearly completely rename the decompiled client so that you can better understand the client code, and then you can find the packet processing methods.</li>
<li>Once you understand the client well enough, you can start implementing the packets into your server (obviously start with login so that you can test the server as you go along)</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope I helped!</p>
<p>Edit: forgot to mention that you may need to set the RSA modulus/exponent to 0 in the client.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Ahh, ok, I see.  It doesn’t involve anything like Client.java, it’s mostly packets.  I can give it a try.</p>
<p>Also, thanks for not just going “OH JOO STOOPOD NuBzOrZzZzZzzZzz U Fa!LlLLl @ TeH LiFeZ1!111111@4$!212!2OneOne!1!1”</p>
<p>Also, Rog3r, I believe he’s just saying “I know how to do this.”[/quote]</p>
<p>Its just better to orginize your methods and in this case, since 508’s or 503’s are built better, it doesn’t increase the lag if you handle things</p>
