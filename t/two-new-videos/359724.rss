    <title>Two new videos</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/two-new-videos/359724</link>
    <description>My Website &gt; Portfolio Section

Two final projects I embarked on for last quarter are the top two videos in the list. Had too much going on and they were rushed. Render quality isn&#39;t the best because of that, but still. Quite a bit of time spent on them.

What do you guys think?</description>

<p>Try again. I never thought I’d exceed my few GB bandwidth a month, but I also wasn’t hosting my own videos on that site either. Just within a few hours it went over lol. I’ve upgraded though, and it’s working for me right now.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/holic">@Holic</a>: Thanks. Out of the two new ones, I’d like to improve that one the most. I had about 3 days to do it, and I spent too much time with the crappy glass blowing out. So, the 2D glasses part of it look pretty bad. I’ll probably revisit it sometime later or at least continue the concept. It was a quick animation so it could have been timed better. The pace picks up a little during it but I think it could’ve gotten a little faster and crazier.</p>
