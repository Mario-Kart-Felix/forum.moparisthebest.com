I re-read some of my comments and I do think I took it overboard with his system(was mad that day). His system isn’t actually bad. Not everyone has that Position class but overall I think that it is pretty good what he is doing as he doesn’t have to loop through each door he has to open like mine was doing.[/quote]Formatting the position class shouldn’t be hard, long as you read and write it using the same format.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>Just to clarify you need to call DoorHandler.loadDoors(file path) on start-up somewhere. This doesn’t support multiple doors but it would be a small amendment.</p>
<p>Example config file:</p>
<p>[code]# object faces go 0, -1, -2, -3 west, north, east, south or something, figure it out lol!</p>
<h1>the following isnt a real door btw</h1>
<h1>OBJECT ID	POSITION	DEFAULT_STATE(OPEN?)	OPEN_FACE	CLOSE_FACE</h1>
<p>1320	X Y Z	FALSE	-2	-3[/code]</p>
<p>You wanted the send object packet, here’s its structure.</p>
<p>[code=java]    public void sendObject(int objectId, int objectType, int objectFace,<br>
Position pos) {<br>
// Sending obj coords<br>
StreamBuffer.OutBuffer out = StreamBuffer.newOutBuffer(16);<br>
out.writeHeader(getEncryptor(), 85);<br>
out.writeByte(pos.getLocalY(player.getPosition()), StreamBuffer.ValueType.C);<br>
out.writeByte(pos.getLocalX(player.getPosition()), StreamBuffer.ValueType.C);</p>
<pre><code>    // Removing current object
    out.writeHeader(getEncryptor(), 101);
    out.writeByte((objectType &lt;&lt; 2) + (objectFace &amp; 3), StreamBuffer.ValueType.C);
    out.writeByte(0);
    
    // Sending new object
    if (objectId != -1) {
        out.writeHeader(getEncryptor(), 151);
        out.writeByte(0, StreamBuffer.ValueType.A);
        out.writeShort(objectId, StreamBuffer.ByteOrder.LITTLE);
        out.writeByte((objectType &lt;&lt; 2) + (objectFace &amp; 3), StreamBuffer.ValueType.S);
    }
    send(out.getBuffer());
}[/code]</code></pre>

Where is this error? You think grabbing the value out of the door by the string position is better,<br>
[/quote]Let alone not having a doors class? You didn’t finish a string literal.</p>
<p>The object click packet sends you three values. Object ID, x ordinate and y ordinate. Your method will lead to you needing to iterate through the array to find the resultant object. Now, incase you didn’t know, a HashMap uses an underlying array. It may not share the same speed but it’s still fast and I think the get function serves me perfectly. I use this to identify the door being clicked. Why do I prefer this way? well I get the position of the object and id from the packet, searching by id will lead to conflicts and thus possibly an irrelevant door being returned and manipulated. So instead I opted to use the position to grab the item.</p>
<p>As for my file parsing, it’s a fairly simplistic approach. For the record, I never said “grabbing the value out of the door by the string position is better”. If you’re referring to how retrieve my Door object, then sure, in my case I think it is.</p>
<p>Explain your side rather than posting two line juvenile comments,</p>

I do have a Doors class I just didn’t feel the need to post it here because I was just showing how I load the data. Anyways I’m actually done now you have your way of loading it I have my way of loading it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your code has an error in it. Good job pal.</li>
<li>How are you now going to identify what door it is? By looping through your 2,000 doors?</li>
<li>XML is unnecessary file-size due to it being so verboose.</li>
<li>Lol list to array good plan!</li>

The way you load doors is so weird. Why are you using a string to look it up it doesn’t make sense? anyways I’m done.</p>
<p>Just wanted to show you a better way to load them.</p>

<p>I know what a collection is lol. How are you loading doors externally? Aren’t you doing something like this.</p>
<p>[code=java]<br>
public class Door {</p>
<pre><code>private int doorX;
private int doorY;

public int getX() {
	return doorX;
}

public int getY() {
	return doorY;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>And then storing different instances of the class to act as each door.[/quote]You mean how am I storing the parsed data - creating a class like that doesn’t magically load data. Yes I am storing them in a Door file.</p>
