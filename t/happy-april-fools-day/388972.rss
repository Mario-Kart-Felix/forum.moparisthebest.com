    <title>Happy April Fools&#39; Day!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/happy-april-fools-day/388972</link>
    <description>I&#39;m posting this an hour early but obviously it&#39;s been the day for quite awhile. We have a hypnotist coming to our school tomorrow (hopefully THAT isn&#39;t a joke) but otherwise I&#39;m going to spend the day making lame pranks against family and friends. If anything, what do you do for April Fools&#39; Day?</description>

Worst day ever.</p>
<p>My girlfriend and I have been dating for nearly 8 years, and we’ve lived together for most of that time. Last month, I bought an engagement ring and proposed to her, and she happily said yes. I thought it’d be funny to play an awful prank on her for April Fools’ Day, and well, I was wrong.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Yesterday, I started acting a bit different and preoccupied, but just enough for her to take notice. Last night before we went to bed, I told her there was something really important we had to talk about today and I think she got a bit nervous. Today, I started a serious conversation with her and she was obviously very curious to know what it was about. I told her that I had fallen in love with another woman and that I no longer wanted to be with her. She immediately started crying and then proceeded to take the ring off and throw it at me. Obviously, I tried explaining that I wasn’t serious, but she wouldn’t believe anything I said. After saying a bunch of less than pleasent stuff to me, she got in our car and left. That was 5 hours ago. I’ve been trying to call her since then without any answer and I’ve left tens of messages.</p>
<p>Anybody else ruin their life today?  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>

Worst day ever.</p>
<p>My girlfriend and I have been dating for nearly 8 years, and we’ve lived together for most of that time. Last month, I bought an engagement ring and proposed to her, and she happily said yes. I thought it’d be funny to play an awful prank on her for April Fools’ Day, and well, I was wrong.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Yesterday, I started acting a bit different and preoccupied, but just enough for her to take notice. Last night before we went to bed, I told her there was something really important we had to talk about today and I think she got a bit nervous. Today, I started a serious conversation with her and she was obviously very curious to know what it was about. I told her that I had fallen in love with another woman and that I no longer wanted to be with her. She immediately started crying and then proceeded to take the ring off and throw it at me. Obviously, I tried explaining that I wasn’t serious, but she wouldn’t believe anything I said. After saying a bunch of less than pleasent stuff to me, she got in our car and left. That was 5 hours ago. I’ve been trying to call her since then without any answer and I’ve left tens of messages.</p>
<p>Anybody else ruin their life today?  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>

That wasn’t an april fools joke, that was pure douchebaggery…[/quote]<br>
Girls don’t beleive in April fools day im finding out, I told my girl friend Shayna after she got out of school today that I was having an affair with her mom, she then proceded to kick me in the balls and throw a bowling ball on my leg. I even said it jokingly, then her mom came in laughing (not knowing she had given me a big fracture in my leg) said “no in your dreams hun”. Then they both started to laugh and now im in the hospital and missing out on pranking. <em>Sigh</em> P.S. I hate all of you &lt;3</p>
