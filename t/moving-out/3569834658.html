Your an idiot for thinking its always the ‘child’s’ fault. Some people, the parents can be the problem. I was in an abusive setting for around 7-8 years. Here was the issue that would bring up some of the abusive settings: Mowing the yard (mind you the state i lived in at the time, was in the triple didgets for temperature [112F i believe?]), After it was about half done, i decided to come inside for a drink, and to sit for 2-3 minutes. Simple right? No, not for my step-dad, it had to be done right there and then, or i wasn’t doing it at all to him. He went out to finish it (after beating me around), and ended up having a heat-stroke. Shows that bastard right. My hate twards him wrong? No, not to me.</p>

<p>No i had the comment removed because you are obviously a spamming troll. Was i asking anyone to take my side?</p>
<p>I was asking for TIPS not for CRITICISM, now i know the title should have been Moving out, Trolls welcome!</p>
<p>I could really care less about what you think of me. You’re obviously an uneducated troll who is pretty hated upon this website, and probably IRL. Don’t attempt to send me criticism, you should take a long hard think about your pathetic life.</p>
<p>Stop insulting others on a forum and trying to make your e-penis bigger.</p>

<p>Adam, you need to read what i have also posted contrary to the apartment situation</p>
<p>I’m currently under care under an organization called the Ministry, basically the agreement is if i leave home they split my utilities with me, and groceries, etc. I need to pay the other half. (They are also my co-signers for my Apartment if i had an accident happen, or i owe the bank money for example, they will take over the payment for that month, usually giving me a few opportunities to set myself straight financially)</p>
<p>When people are pricks, i fire back. At least analyze the thread Adam, i ask for help, i didn’t ask for CRITICISM.</p>
<p>Most of the pre-pubescent mongoloid fucks that simply cannot post without posting something useless will receive my gunfire back.</p>
<p>Especially users like Errorist who keep putting gasoline on a fire.</p>
<p>Edit: Don’t bother making a big post about how i shouldn’t move out, i could really care less.</p>
