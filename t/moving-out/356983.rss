    <title>Moving out</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moving-out/356983</link>
    <description>I am planning on moving out within the next month to my own place. I am having troubles at home with parents and i am not really getting along with them like i used to, and it&#39;s getting to the point where all we say to each other is that we are going to kick the shit out of one another.

Does anyone have any tips on moving out or living on your own? I am 16 and have a part time job, i make around 1,635$ CAD monthly. And i work at the local boxing gym. 

I am bringing a couch, a flatscreen tv, basic shit such as chairs, clothes and whatnot. 

I&#39;m asking for help, not for criticism.</description>

<p>Aaron, your immaturity in this thread has shown me (and others, which you’ve decided to push off) that you’re not ready to move out of your house. Take the advice of the others and fix your side of the relationship with your family. You’ll be surprised to see that changing your attitude is going to change the attitude of others around you.[/quote]</p>
<p>Adam, you need to read what i have also posted contrary to the apartment situation</p>
<p>I’m currently under care under an organization called the Ministry, basically the agreement is if i leave home they split my utilities with me, and groceries, etc. I need to pay the other half. (They are also my co-signers for my Apartment if i had an accident happen, or i owe the bank money for example, they will take over the payment for that month, usually giving me a few opportunities to set myself straight financially)</p>
<p>When people are pricks, i fire back. At least analyze the thread Adam, i ask for help, i didn’t ask for CRITICISM.</p>
<p>Most of the pre-pubescent mongoloid fucks that simply cannot post without posting something useless will receive my gunfire back.</p>
<p>Especially users like Errorist who keep putting gasoline on a fire.</p>
<p>Edit: Don’t bother making a big post about how i shouldn’t move out, i could really care less.</p>

<p>No i had the comment removed because you are obviously a spamming troll. Was i asking anyone to take my side?</p>
<p>I was asking for TIPS not for CRITICISM, now i know the title should have been Moving out, Trolls welcome!</p>
<p>I could really care less about what you think of me. You’re obviously an uneducated troll who is pretty hated upon this website, and probably IRL. Don’t attempt to send me criticism, you should take a long hard think about your pathetic life.</p>
<p>Stop insulting others on a forum and trying to make your e-penis bigger.</p>

Your an idiot for thinking its always the ‘child’s’ fault. Some people, the parents can be the problem. I was in an abusive setting for around 7-8 years. Here was the issue that would bring up some of the abusive settings: Mowing the yard (mind you the state i lived in at the time, was in the triple didgets for temperature [112F i believe?]), After it was about half done, i decided to come inside for a drink, and to sit for 2-3 minutes. Simple right? No, not for my step-dad, it had to be done right there and then, or i wasn’t doing it at all to him. He went out to finish it (after beating me around), and ended up having a heat-stroke. Shows that bastard right. My hate twards him wrong? No, not to me.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Coon</span>, i lived in an abusive household for 8 years, physical and emotional abuse, after continual years of abuse i decided to live with a grandparent. Out of nowhere she had a psychotic episode and hasn’t stopped screaming since, so i feel that i need to be on my own, i also have some support from my brother, so that’ll help also. He’s my employer too.</p>

<p>We don’t know everything that goes on with his parents. So it’s best we stay away from that topic.</p>
<p>That’s plenty enough to live on your own. Always remember your other needs too though, like food, clothes, etc… Just try to handle being with your parent for a little while longer and save as much as you can. That way you won’t be stressed the first few months about bills. I know some apartment complexes offer free water and cable. So be looking for that. Good luck…</p>
