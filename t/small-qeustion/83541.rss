              <p>Ide think it would be best to make the entire game not using scar.  Learnign java and stuff would be good for making a game I think.  Best to just make the game using something else i think.</p>
<p>Although, scar can still make great 2D* games.</p>

<p>Most easiest way is to convert to a language that can make things runnable without it, or java since MOST computers since 2000~? have java preinstalled.</p>

<p>Look up the drawing functions or the script FastDrawTest.scar in C:\Program Files\SCAR\scripts\test.</p>
