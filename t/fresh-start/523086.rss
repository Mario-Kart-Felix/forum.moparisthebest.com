    <description>After talking with Tom about a map reset he has declined the suggestion but has said that I should post here to get the rest of the teams opinions. Toms argument is that people have worked to hard on builds to lose it which obviously is a solid reason not to reset the map. As you know Tom has come up with the idea of bringing back the old maps in a multi-world type thing so I propose why not do the same with the current vanilla map as well, this will give people who want a start fresh the chance to have one and will allow the people who don&#39;t want to lose their builds the chance to carry on.

Post your opinions pleaseeee.</description>

<p>The whole point is so that people can get a fresh start on a fresh map. It’s easy to say why not just move away from everything and get rid of your items but it doesn’t feel the same as pretty much every farm you’d need has already been created and is on the map for example the enderman Xp farm.</p>
