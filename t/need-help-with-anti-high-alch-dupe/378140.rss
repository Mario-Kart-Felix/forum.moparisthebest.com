    <title>Need Help With Anti High Alch Dupe</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-anti-high-alch-dupe/378140</link>
    <description>Ok i&#39;ve been looking around for this one.  I need a code that fixed the high alch spell so people can&#39;t dupe.

[b]The High Alch Dupe:[/b] get high alch runes, have item u want high alch duped in inventory.  Then you withdraw blodd runes and start duping.  It high keeps high alching the same item.  I need a code that fixes this problem. Thanks

BTW i&#39;m using an Allstar based source, so czar

[code]
                                    if (castSpell == 1178) // High Alch
            {
                if ((playerLevel[6] &gt;= 55) &amp;&amp; (actionTimer == 0)){
                    if ((playerHasItemAmount(561, 1) == false)
                            || (playerHasItemAmount(554, 5) == false)) {
                        sendMessage(
                                &quot;You do not have enough runes to cast this spell.&quot;);
                    } else if ((playerHasItemAmount(561, 1) == true)
                            &amp;&amp; (playerHasItemAmount(554, 5) == true)) {
                        deleteItem(castOnItem, castOnSlot, 1);
                        addItem(995, alchvaluez);
                        addSkillXP((65 * playerLevel[6]), 6);
                        setAnimation(712);
                        stillgfx(113, absY, absX);
                        resetanim = 12;
                        deleteItem(561, getItemSlot(561), 1);
	    actionTimer = 50;
sendMessage(&quot;You Have To Wait 1 Minute Before High Alching Again&quot;);
	}
	} else if (playerLevel[6] &lt;= 55) {
                    sendMessage(
                            &quot;You need at least 55 Magic to cast High Level Alchemy&quot;);

                }
[/code]

the action Timer stuff was how i stopped it for now, but its such a terrible fix and people can still just wait out the action Timer then dupe it.  So i
i&#39;d really appreciate it if some1 could help</description>
