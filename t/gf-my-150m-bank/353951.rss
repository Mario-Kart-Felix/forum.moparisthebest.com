    <description>okay, so last night I was asked to join my friends friends swiftirc to PK with them, his friend had been risking like 16m, other was risking 22m, and my friend Abdul was there with me [one who takes the pic shown], so I join the irc, and all of a sudden I dc, yet I can do everything else, so I try to get back on 5 minutes later, password changed, I was risking max mage, dfs, claws, and bandos.

No ROL.

Kid got everything.

<p>It doesn’t, unless they run their own server, but his IP still wouldn’t get them anything.  You can’t do anything with just an IP.</p>

<p>No, you can’t spread anything on IRC, even if you run your own server (which I do).  You can send files over IRC to people, but the person would have to physically accept them and then run them, same as over the web.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m sorry, but this isn’t possible.  You cannot ‘be hacked’ through IRC, ever.  For him to have gotten any type of information, you either had to type it into IRC (you didn’t use the same password as you do in RS did you?..), some website, or you downloaded and ran a program he sent you that was a virus.  Before starting any new account you obviously should figure out how he got your password in the first place shouldn’t you?  Otherwise you are just wasting your time leveling up another account for him.<br>
[/quote]wasting time?<br>
I’ve tried 20+ recoveries so far, DENIED.<br>
And it is possible to gain information on an unencrypted connection, with cain and abel.<br>
so i’ve heard…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m saying you will be wasting time leveling up another character, because if you installed one of his viruses on your computer he still has access to your password.</p>
<p>It is possible to steal your information over an un-encrypted connection, IF they are in between you and the internet (eg, your router) or if you are connected via wifi and they are within a few hundred feet of you.  Obviously neither one of those things happened.</p>
<p>Also, your entire runescape connection is not encrypted, but your username and password are encrypted with RSA, making it impossible for them to be ‘sniffed’ or stolen even if they were in your router or right next to you with a laptop grabbing your wireless packets.</p>
<p>Bottom line is connecting to IRC did not get your password stolen, even if he owns the server, and has your IP.  You either told him your password some way (used it as your IRC password perhaps?), or you downloaded and ran a program from him that contained a virus, probably with a keylogger in it.  Understand? :)[/quote]Most likely.<br>
I found out what it was, my Nod32 was off and I had ran his private server which had a crypted RAT file, which was started when I started the client.<br>
It’s gone now, so I don’t need to worry.<br>
He now has all my info.<br>
great on my part for thinking, hurrrrr.</p>

Also, your entire runescape connection is not encrypted, but your username and password are encrypted with RSA, making it impossible for them to be ‘sniffed’ or stolen even if they were in your router or right next to you with a laptop grabbing your wireless packets.<br>

No, I believe we just deactivate it. (Correct me if I’m wrong someone)</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but this isn’t possible.  You cannot ‘be hacked’ through IRC, ever.  For him to have gotten any type of information, you either had to type it into IRC (you didn’t use the same password as you do in RS did you?..), some website, or you downloaded and ran a program he sent you that was a virus.  Before starting any new account you obviously should figure out how he got your password in the first place shouldn’t you?  Otherwise you are just wasting your time leveling up another account for him.</p>

Wait… what happened? Why did password change, I’m confused lol.<br>
