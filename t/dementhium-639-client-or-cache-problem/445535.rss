    <title>Dementhium 639 Client or Cache problem?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dementhium-639-client-or-cache-problem/445535</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve done some recent additions lately(: To the Quantum source made summoning npcs spawnable and some other little things. one problem I&#39;ve found. I jarred the client and sent it to my players when I hosted it on my localhost. everyone was having a good time. put it on my vps and now players can&#39;t do anything like the icons and chatbox are fucked. They can&#39;t do anything once they are logged in accept for basically walking around and talking to NPCs. they cant even open the shops/: the interface where the tabs are is lit up with yellow boxs and the chatbox is black for them. I didn&#39;t have this problem until I put it on the VPS. can the releaser or anyone help me?/:</description>
