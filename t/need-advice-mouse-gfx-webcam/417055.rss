    <title>Need advice (mouse/gfx/webcam)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-advice-mouse-gfx-webcam/417055</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t kept up with hardware for the last year or so, and I want to buy a new mouse, graphics card and maybe a webcam depending on how cheap I can get a decent one.

Mouse - I&#39;m not sure if I want wired or wireless. It would be nice to not have the wire, but is it worth it? Looking to spend &lt; $100.

Graphics - I&#39;m not a huge gamer, but I definitely need an upgrade from my current card (8800gs). Looking for something in medium-high power/price range, ~$150 ??

Webcam - I have no clue. I just need something to skype with, would be nice if it had a built-in mic. Wouldn&#39;t mind spending a bit more if I could get an HD one to record video once in a while.

don’t know anything about webcams, but i saw this and it may perhaps work.  bit cheap, reviews say quality etc don’t do much justice, but looks ok enough.</p>
