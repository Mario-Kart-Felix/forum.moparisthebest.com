    <title>Getting sued by Jagex?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-sued-by-jagex/322119</link>
    <description>What are the chances of getting sued or &quot;warned&quot; by Jagex if I run a 24/7 server with a website that sells premium and accepts donations? I want to run my server forever without having to change the name and the site because of Jagex. My old server (Knight&#39;s Realm) was only accepting donations and I got 3 warnings from Jagex, so I decided to make a new server like it but better and change the name. I switched from Knight&#39;s Realm to RuneEden.</description>

              <p><span class="hashtag">#1</span>. No you will not get sued by Jagex, the odds are like 1/99999999999.<br>
<span class="hashtag">#2</span>. Jagex has some of the worst law personal I have seen in years (I know cause my dads a lawyer)<br>
<span class="hashtag">#3</span>. Jagex’s only reason for getting rid of Private Runescape Servers is because they don’t want any competition, its all about the moneynow<br>
<span class="hashtag">#4</span>. Jagex has been trying to “shut down” my server for about 2 years now, im not even scraed of them anymore, when they send me emails now I send funny responses back.<br>
<span class="hashtag">#5</span>. Jagex is not powerful unless you live in there area, they cant tuch the united states lol.</p>

              <p>the wow thing is really annoying, I think I’m going to track them down and make them suffer. If you click on their site you will be redirected to <a href="http://worldofwaZcraft.com" rel="nofollow noopener">worldofwaZcraft.com</a> which is a fake login page. It is clever, but could be better</p>
<p>You can answer jagex and ask them to tell you what you’ve done. If everyone that owns a server would fight back I think they won’t even bother to close servers down anymore… They don’t have the power to do anything to you anyway, they are probably just trying to scare you and make you give up.</p>
<p>What I suggest is to reply them back, be gentle, show them respect but trick them at the same time. If you’re smart you are gonna make it, if they are ever going to email you, of course.</p>
<p>Have a good day! If they email you, tell them to pay me a visit.</p>

<p>Can I say any more?</p>
<p>You do know how easy I can send you an email from <span class="mention">@jagex.com</span> with a php mailer, do you?</p>
<p>Give me your email and you’ll have about 20 messages from <span class="mention">@jagex.com</span> in like a few minutes, lol.</p>

              <p>MITB was very strong in his replies as you can see. Since this site is not hosting anything, only providing information, Jagex cant do a thing.<br>
But a public server, that’s also commercial… They will try to take you down if they get the chance.</p>
<p>By means of copyright claims towards your VPS host, and your website’s host too. Think of it as scare tactics…</p>
