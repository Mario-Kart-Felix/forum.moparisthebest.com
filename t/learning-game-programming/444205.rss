    <description>Are there any good tutorials out there that could teach me how to load, animate, and move sprites properly, and just game program in general? I have found tutorials on this before, but they always left me with questions because they were not explained properly, anyone know any good ones? Or possibly a book I could get?</description>

<p>That is what I’ve done ever since I wanted my own rsps. You should check out TheNewBoston on youtube for his Java Game Development tutorials, and definitely check this out <a href="http://www.jguru.com/article/client-side/java-game-development-tutorial.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.jguru.com/article/client-side/java-game-development-tutorial.html</a>, I thought it was easy to understand.</p>
