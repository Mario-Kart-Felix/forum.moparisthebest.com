    <description>The tittle is pretty self explanatory, all i need it to change the damage a weapon does. I mostly just want to change the damage to d claws but i don&#39;t know how to do it. I remember coming across a post like this but i can&#39;t find it, any help would be greatly appreciated!</description>

              <p>Ok what you want to do is open your Item file. Should be in Config. Open that up, find your item. After the item id and item name and item description there is a bunch of numbers. The first 3 are how much the item is, so skip those. Then the rest of the numbers mean = Str Bonus, Def Bonus, Attack Bonus. Change those the way you want them to do, and the item will hit more.</p>
