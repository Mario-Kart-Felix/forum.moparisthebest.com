    <description>Hello everyone!

[size=14pt][b][u]Who Am I?[/u][/b][/size]

Let me start off by saying I registered on &quot;July 19, 2010, 01:12:20 PM&quot; and have been on and off with Moparscape over the years.

I recently graduated from a vocational highschool taking Computer Programming for four years. I have been doing HTML, PHP, MySQL, VB.NET, C# and C++, Actionscript and many more over this period of time. I really enjoy programming and I am [u][b]NOT[/b][/u] here looking to be &quot;spoon fed&quot;!!!

I like the 317 pk / command based servers. So I downloaded a [u]DeltaScape[/u] base. It was ok. I removed the Anti leech, but it didn&#39;t feel right. There was too much &quot;junk&quot; in the client.java and other files. I downloaded a cleaned DeltaScape from Tatemo. If anyone knows of him, please help me out here :).

Yes, I have read multiple tutorials on 317&#39;s and I know what I&#39;m doing, code wise. I just can&#39;t get a grip of what&#39;s happening in the files or folders.

[b][size=14pt]What I Need:[/size][/b]

[ul][li]Help on Understanding what each .java file does[/li]
[li]If I want to do something, where can I put it - which function or which .java file[/li]
[li]To make working pk/command based 317 server[/li][/ul]


This cleaned DeltaScape is making me VERY confused. It has this type of file hierarchy:

[ul][li]DeltaScape Cleaned Parent Folder[/li]
[list]
[li]Bin folder[/li]
[li]Server folder[/li]
[list]
[li]Player folder[/li]
[list]
[li]more folders[/li]
[li]Client/Player/PlayerHandler.java files[/li]
[/list]
[li]World folder[/li]
[list]
[li]more folders[/li]
[li]process.java[/li]
[/list]
[li]GameEngine.java[/li]
[/list]
[li]Compiler[/li]
[li]Run[/li]
[/list][/ul]


[size=12pt]Honestly I just don&#39;t know where to start!!! It is very clean. I want to make it playable from start to finish. If I could get some support from the community I would really appreciate it!
Thanks,
Maizez[/size]</description>

Well you can add the teleport function anywhere in the file that isn’t in another method, otherwise that method would have to be called for the teleport method to work.</p>
<p>For the case, you will need to use a switch statement:</p>
<p><code>switch (buttonId) {
     case 50235:
     //Teleport home.
     break;

[/quote]</p>
<p>Great! Now the next step which I got stuck on is to figure out where exactly that block of code goes.<br>
I remember it would go in clickingMost.java<br>
But I don’t see the equivalent of that in this source.[/quote]Just look for when the server handles button clicking, it could be in any class that relates to packets being sent from the server to the client.</p>

Well, to learn what each class files does, you will need to open the file with a notepad, or even the source with an IDE, such as Eclipse or Netbeans. Then you will need to read the code line by line and use common sense to figure out what each class is doing. Another big help for understanding is the naming conventions of the classes, such as the ‘player’ classes, which handle player related stuff.<br>

<p>Thanks for the reply, Onix.</p>
<p>I do have both Eclipse and Netbeans. Let me clarify that I do understand both the naming conventions and most of the code in each file.<br>

<p>To figure out where to put something, also relies on common sense. If you want to make clicking an object do something, you will need to know where that packet is handled, this can be done by reading through the files from the first part of this post. Some servers even have individual classes for this, such as ‘ObjectHandler’.</p>

              <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Who Am I?</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>Let me start off by saying I registered on “July 19, 2010, 01:12:20 PM” and have been on and off with Moparscape over the years.</p>
<p>I recently graduated from a vocational highschool taking Computer Programming for four years. I have been doing HTML, PHP, MySQL, <a href="http://VB.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.NET</a>, C# and C++, Actionscript and many more over this period of time. I really enjoy programming and I am <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span></span> here looking to be “spoon fed”!!!</p>
<p>I like the 317 pk / command based servers. So I downloaded a <span class="bbcode-u">DeltaScape</span> base. It was ok. I removed the Anti leech, but it didn’t feel right. There was too much “junk” in the client.java and other files. I downloaded a cleaned DeltaScape from Tatemo. If anyone knows of him, please help me out here :).</p>
<p>Yes, I have read multiple tutorials on 317’s and I know what I’m doing, code wise. I just can’t get a grip of what’s happening in the files or folders.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=14pt]What I Need:[/size]</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Help on Understanding what each .java file does[/li]<br>
[li]If I want to do something, where can I put it - which function or which .java file[/li]<br>
[li]To make working pk/command based 317 server[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>This cleaned DeltaScape is making me VERY confused. It has this type of file hierarchy:</p>
<p>[ul][li]DeltaScape Cleaned Parent Folder[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Bin folder[/li]<br>
[li]Server folder[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Player folder[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]more folders[/li]<br>
[li]Client/Player/PlayerHandler.java files[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]World folder[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]more folders[/li]<br>
[li]process.java[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]GameEngine.java[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]Compiler[/li]<br>
[li]Run[/li]<br>
[/list][/ul]</p>
<p>[size=12pt]Honestly I just don’t know where to start!!! It is very clean. I want to make it playable from start to finish. If I could get some support from the community I would really appreciate it!<br>
Thanks,<br>
