    <title>A good source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-good-source/403040</link>
    <description>Does anyone know a good source that I can use? My first one was DSPK and I hate it so much there is way to many servers with it so I want a good 317, with maybe some new items. Old graphics, old whip, idrc about hp bar. But yeah, you get what I&#39;m saying. I want a good 317 that is like the old runescape. I was suggesting downloading the original PI and using it as a base, but there is a lot of bugs in it that I would have no clue how to fix.</description>
