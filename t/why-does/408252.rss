    <title>Why does</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-does/408252</link>
    <description>the amount of memory rs uses increase everytime you move you mouse? idk if its just me but i hit the ` key to open the dev console and typed &quot;displayfps&quot; so i was at the login screen and notices the memory usage slowly increasing just sitting there doing nothing. i move my mouse around and i notice it increases the memory dramatically. moving my mouse in a circular motion for like 10 seconds adds like 5mb to the memory usage. idk whe they do a garbage collect but it gets pretty high b4 they do on the login screen. i assume it does it more often when u are actually playing(i havent tested anything more then what i am currently posting). so i got it up to 50-60 mb then i opened up the java console from the tray bar, and hit g. it brought the memory back down to 20mb b/c it if u dont know that does a garbage collect.

well i found it a little interesting, and was wondering how much jagex could do to make RS use only as much computer resources it needs(i assume they do better on that when u are actually playing)?</description>

Macro detection most likely, how else would they be able to detect bots that use continuous mouse paths?[/quote]</p>
<p>is it just on the welcome screen where it doesnt do anything with the mouse recording? i havent looked into the client code much, but if a bot uses the exact mouse path everytime im sure it will have more flaws jagex could catch other than the mouse path. i assume that when u play the recordings are streamed to jagex. recording mouse clicks seems like all u would need(determine the amount of time it took to get from point a to point b, compare that to control data being an average movement speed and the speed at which is impossible for a human to move).</p>

<p>These days it’s not used so much for macro detection as a timer for when your character logs out. It starts counting the log-out timer after your mouse stop’s moving for 60 seconds.</p>

</aside>
<p>if thats how jagex does that it seems very inefficient and resource wasteful. the checks could be spread out to a second all the way to minute intervals, comparing the values save upon the last mouse move(starts/resets the count)/key press event(resets the time out count). idk if im not seeing this from the correct viewpoint or not. just my idea on that.</p>
