    <title>College Courses</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/college-courses/555162</link>
    <description>I am a senior in HS about to go to college. I would like to end up being a web developer, preferably front end or full stack. I was wondering on how these courses look, should I be studying these classes for my particular career choice, and I do plan to do this and achieve my bachelors in CS.

Instead of typing all of the courses, their descriptions, etc.  (because I&#39;m on an iPhone) 

http://catalog.indstate.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=24&amp;poid=4152&amp;returnto=619

For Smart Phones- I have a bit of a maze for each of you that will take time to look for me. 

You&#39;ll start off by going to this link: m.catalog.indstate.edu/#home

And then go to the undergrad section, then programs, and go into the Computer Science Major section.

On the part where it says &quot;pick a concentration&quot; I&#39;d go with the information science concentration considering it is going more towards web programming. 

Thanks to those that choose to look them over!</description>

              <p>This is a bit of an “Update” to this topic.</p>
<p>I have completed my High School Finals and will graduate on the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>I start College at Indiana State (the college with these classes: <a href="http://catalog.indstate.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=24&amp;poid=4152&amp;returnto=619" rel="nofollow noopener">http://catalog.indstate.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=24&amp;poid=4152&amp;returnto=619</a> ) In August this year.</p>
<p>I would like to know from each of you that have gone and done this, of any tips or advice I could use. Or for instance, what you recommend I learn before I go into this if I haven’t already. Thanks!</p>

<p>I’m just wondering if it would be better to go to the two year school and learn the information that they offer or the four year school for what they have. I seem to believe the two year school has more information going straight towards what I want to do after college, web development. More feedback would be appreciated</p>

              <p>I don’t know what your question is but if you’re looking for electives geared toward web development it would seem CS 170, 479, and 457 are “ideal”. Although the course descriptions don’t sound very good because: you’ll probably never use VBScript (seriously, in web dev literally never), I don’t know why you get taught Perl/CGI, and you’ll most likely never use ASP (or maybe even JSP but I’m not sure how much it’s used these days).</p>
<p>You’ll get more out of learning modern web frameworks than taking those courses.</p>
