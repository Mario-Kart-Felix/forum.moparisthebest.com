    <title>Fixing the boards</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixing-the-boards/431144</link>
    <description>obviously we need to cascade some of these sections. 

As for tutorials, id say dont worry about them. Since we allow mixed languages we dont need to stress over them. Concept tutorials and people asking about concepts are good, and we will always welcome tutorials but dont make a huge deal about them right now

So what can we do to fix redundancy?</description>

              <p>The only boards I really didn’t think needed to be merged were Arcade Room and Dev Progress. They are for separate things imo. Are there any other boards?</p>
<p>I like the idea of a gallery, but it mostly likely involves a lot of web dev time that I don’t have atm. So any alternative is preferred.</p>

              <p>Well, the main thing is that we haven’t got enough people active here to really have a need for certain sections, mostly under programming, so I guess we could merge some of those boards together until we actually need the individual boards.<br>
Also, the Arcade Room to me seems rather redundant to me, and I guess that could be merged under Development Progress <span class="bbcode-b">or</span> we could set up some kind of gallery for it.</p>
<p>Those are my 2 cents, I can’t really think of anything else that could be useful to do.</p>
