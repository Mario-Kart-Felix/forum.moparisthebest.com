    <description>[center]We are a experienced faction PVP server with some epic features!

[+] Great staff!

[+] Best community out there!

[+] Vote everyday for items!

[+] Different ranks!

[+] Plenty of plugins!

[+] No lag!

[+] Automatic VIP system!

[-] You&#39;re not here yet!


We will setup a few minigames for the server such as: Mob arena, Hunger Games and Spleef!

Suggest any minigames that we could install below!

We currently run a high end dedicated server with plenty of dedicated RAM and a high speed quad core processor. This guarantees that you will never feel lag and the server uptime will be the best you&#39;ve ever experienced.

We have extremely good and friendly staff members who are active every day and able to help and guide players through a unique Minecraft PvP experience. Whether you&#39;re new to Factions/PvP or a seasoned veteran, EarthCraft is the server for you!

We&#39;re also looking for mature and active staff for the server as it grows bigger and bigger everyday. By voting you make the server bigger and better. That is something that opens moderator spots for players that want to share their knowledge and help newcomers. If this sounds something good to you then what are you still waiting for?

See you in EarthCraft!
earthcraftpvp.net

Rules:
[1] Be respectful!
[2] Be legit!
[3] Don&#39;t swear!
[4] Never abuse bugs, report them to staff instead!
[5] You may NOT use any sort of a hack-client!
[6] Do NOT share your account with anyone!
[7] This is a Factions/PvP/Raid server. If you get griefed, you don&#39;t tell it to the staff!
[8] You are NOT allowed to grief the spawn![/center]</description>
