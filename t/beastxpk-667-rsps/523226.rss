    This is a 667 rsps owned by &quot;Beast.&quot; This server is 1/3 spawn. Once you log in, you can do ;;master. After that, other commands are ;;melee,range,mage,hybid. This is mainly a pk server and pvm. Every monster is coded in our server, besides nex, nex is currently undergo for coding. Staff is especially needed. We are in need of mature staff members. Our server is VPS hosted. And average about 10-15 players a day. our server came out 6/15/2013. I could say we are doing pretty well but we could do better!
