    <title>Why cant i host my server anymore?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-cant-i-host-my-server-anymore/240890</link>
    <description>ok this is really annoying me.  I followed the steps to creating my own server and for a peroid of time i was able to host my own server.  in the proccess of creating my server i noticed some unusual things happened in my server like character files not being saved.  i asked my friend to see if he could he on to my server and all of a sudden he couldn&#39;t when he used to before.  i tried switching through different types of sources but it didnt fix anything.  my fire walls are no even on so they wouldnt be blocking it.  The only thing i can think of is the fact that i port forwarded wrong, but that makes me think why was it working before then.  plz i need help about this matter and i dont know what to do anymore.  I just switched routers but the problems started happened before my router got switched out.  thank you for whoever answer this or who at least tries to !!</description>
