    <description>Hello Im tfortacos 
I am very new to 562 server My friend Mar The owner of the server downloaded a client and source
we had trusted other coders before but all dint know wtf they were doing i need a real legit coder
 here are things that need to be coded :D 
 
-P Ring stats :&#39;/ been trying to fix all night dont work
-All Npc&#39;s drop Dagnnoth bones? Cant fix either ):
-Dagannoth kings need to have corresponding drops
 1.The rings they are all mixed up 
 2.Dagannoth kings are non-agressive and do not hit back when you attack them?
-If its not to much to ask for Can you add chaotic models to the source?
A working G.e? and Fixed party room?[I will Drop in a 15$ Itunes card if you can do all 3 :D]

And i cant relly pay you in cash but if any one is intrested I can buy a 10$ itunes gift card if you have a itunes account i can give you the Code so  basicly im paying you in Itunes Cash  Just Leave
A comment  below if you can do those things once you fix I will buy the itunes card and give you the code ^^;
Thank you very much...
