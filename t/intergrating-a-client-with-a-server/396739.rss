    <title>Intergrating a client with a server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/intergrating-a-client-with-a-server/396739</link>
    <description>Hi, I have this client that I have worked on and I wanted to find a source for it so I dled the pur3scapez source or w/e it&#39;s called but when I try to connect to it with my client it just says error connecting. Is there a way I can make it work by like intergrating the client and source?

This is what it has on the CMD -
[code]011/05/28 18:20:37] [AnonymousIoService-1]: New session from: /127.0.0.1:58087
[2011/05/28 18:20:37] [AnonymousIoService-2]: Login request: [username=null,password=Â¯KÂ­=Â°â€°G].
