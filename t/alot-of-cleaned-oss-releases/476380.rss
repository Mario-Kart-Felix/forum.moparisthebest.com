    <description>Hey all,
I noticed that there are a lot of cleaned delta&#39;s and stuff are in progress or released.
Which is pretty funny since every thread says they are like pissed about the rsps looking like the new rs. Anyways i was wondering why everyone makes this old school servers?</description>

When some people (people that don’t know jack shit about what their doing) attempt it, its hardcoded, sloppy, and totally unnecessary because if they want a complete 508+ server they can USE AN ACTUAL 508 CLIENT AND SERVER.</p>
<p>People who are making these ‘old school servers’ are just sticking to the era the server and client were meant to be in.[/quote]It’s harder to write a newer server from scratch and implement everything a 317 server has than it is to take a 317 client and implement all the content a newer cache has.</p>
