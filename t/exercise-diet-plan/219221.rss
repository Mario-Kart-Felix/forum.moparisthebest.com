    <title>Exercise/Diet Plan</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/exercise-diet-plan/219221</link>
    <description>Well this might not be your everyday mopar graphics request :/

So the request is a Exercise/Diet Planner.

I want it in a simple table format with the following headings: Calorie Intake,Fat(G),Exercise Performed,Calories burned. 

Can&#39;t think of any other headings at the moment,but if you got some suggestions I&#39;m up for it.

Also if you have nothing useful to say,don&#39;t post.

I tried Google,looking for a printable diet/exercise planner, but none I found was exactly what I was looking for...

Please and thanks.</description>

<p>Well,that’s what I planned on doing,wasn’t sure if I could make the plan the way I wanted to,well if no one takes the request I’ll probably take a stab at using excel to make it.</p>
<p>Also thanks,exp for the suggestions,I’ll probably implement some of those.</p>

              <p>I would say add in a morning weight check, morning heart rate check (possibly during the workout as well), and overall feeling that day (quality of workout and level of difficulty [1-10], as well as if you felt like you had a good day or not).  Then maybe a quick comment box on how your day went and what you did.</p>
<p>This way you can look back at some day when you improved alot and see exactly what was different from the previous days, or the same if you had a bad day and you can see what to avoid.  And heart rate is a very big plus, as it never lies.  It tells you straight forward what kind of condition you are in.</p>
<p>All professional athletes involved in endurance sports keep a log like this, to make sure they stay in top shape.  Even with just simple dieting, it will be worth it in the long run if you want to be dedicated.</p>
