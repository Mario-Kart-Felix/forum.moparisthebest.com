    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-computer-reconizing-java-files/167940</link>
    <description>When i entered the two codes under system advanced settings &gt;enviromental variables, it didnt work so client.java asked which program i wanted to open it with and to see what happend i clicked notepad. Now i figured out that a part of the code i put in was missing, so i fixed that but now it only opens with notepad. How do i make it open with the original program or script that it is suppsoed to open with?</description>
