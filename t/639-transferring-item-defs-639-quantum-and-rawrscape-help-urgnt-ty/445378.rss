    <description>so today i decided to change my source from quantum 639 to rawrscape 639
(qunatum is basically the same with summoning removed)
because quantum639 didnt haf summoning
but ive spent days changing all the dung armour stats and A SHITTON of prices of all the stuff in the shops (i added like 10 more shops)

and when i decided to change the source (basically the same source) i wanted to keep all the data on items,shops,spawns and everything 

i managed to get the shops and spawns changed by moving shops.bin and npc_spawns.txt

but the problem is i dont know how to move the item definitions...

i tried many ways...

1. i moved itemdefinitions.bat to the other place but nothing happend

2. i sped up my computer calendar to 2013 then i edited an itsm&#39;s definition then i sped it up to 2014 and i seached all the files which were modified within 1 year and that itemdefinitions.bin came up again along with a bunch of items from a folder called items so i moved the entire items folder (contianed approx 3500 files) and i compiled but nothing happend

is thaere anything im doing wrong?

please help  i really dont wana redo all the prices and stats of all the items i use in my shops... 

thx  :)</description>
