    <title>Question about uid</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-uid/7535</link>
    <description>Just checking if I got it right, don&#39;t wanna mess up with something :)


&lt;blockquote&gt;The runescape client, everytime it is run, looks for a certain file which has an uid. If no file is found, it makes a new uid and puts it in that file. If the file is found, it uses the uid in the file. 

That means that if two users are playing with the same UID, the runescape server detects that you might be multi-logging, even if the two users are playing through two different IPs.

Also, if the &quot;unsigned applet&quot; is used instead of the default one, the uid is always new.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is there any error or something important that I missed? Thank you in advance.</description>
