    <title>Shop currency help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shop-currency-help/349927</link>
    <description>I have made warriors guild, almost 100%, and I just need a shop. I know how to add shops, but I don&#39;t know how to make it so it accepts only 1 type of currency. Warrior Guild Tokens, NOT Coins. how would you change it so, this is the ONLY shop that accepts the tokens?</description>
