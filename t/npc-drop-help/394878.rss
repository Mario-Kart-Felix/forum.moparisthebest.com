    <title>NPC Drop Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-drop-help/394878</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to set drops and percentages for my server.
I believe the drop system is sanity&#39;s.
I&#39;ve tried reading up on it but i can&#39;t seem to get it working the way i want it to.

I have these three things.
NpcConstant.TSM
NPCDROPS.TSM
and 
NPCDROPS.CFG

I&#39;ve been experimenting with these three files, then restoring them to they&#39;re original state afterwards, and all I have learned is that the NpcConstant.TSM does is make a drop drop 100% of the time.

My purpose is to make Tormented Demons, Corporal, Kalphite Queen, etc. to drop rares, but not 100% of the time. Would someone mind helping me with this issue.?</description>
