    <title>Npc drop help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-drop-help/330240</link>
    <description>i tried to put pictures up but it didn&#39;t work so ill just try to explain it.
first.
i went to npcdrops.cfg
i added one new npc because it wasn&#39;t in there.
my npc is 2883(dagannoth Rex)
and heres my code for my npcdrop.
[tt]npcdrop = 2279		1		995	9000000[/tt]
first number is my npc id. second number is drop type. 3rd number is item id(coins) and fourth is amount. 
and then i saved and compiled. i killed one and it drops an archers ring. so i got off and i put another dagannoth Rex and instead i changed the item id to 00995 like when you do ::pickup you have to put the zeros.
i saved and compiled and got back on and it dropped a berserker ring.
so i thought my item id&#39;s were mixed up so i opened it up and it said 995= coins and archers ring= 6733 and berserker ring = 6737
so what is wrong?
my compiler says there is no errors either.</description>

              <p>Check your Item2.java<br>
There is probably a method in there that chooses a random drop from a bunch of drops.</p>
<p>To find out what method, check your NpcHandler.java and search for the id of good ol’ Rexie (2279).</p>

<p>A compiler is for Java Source Files(.java), Not Configuration Files(.cfg) It wouldn’t show errors because you don’t compile them.</p>
