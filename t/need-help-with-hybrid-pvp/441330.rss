    <title>Need help with Hybrid PvP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-hybrid-pvp/441330</link>
    <description>I need some help in making a webclient.

I got the CacheDownloader and everything done, but the cache stays at 0% even thought it gives me the error &quot;directory still exists&quot;

If anybody know hows to fix this, please help me. I will return the favour.

Me and my friend both tried it, and we failed. So if you can help me, please please help me.</description>
