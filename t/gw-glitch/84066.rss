    <description>I was playing and my friend got a new bow. The Mesh didn&#39;t load and the trading image was a loading thing that never loaded. I recorded it. Sorry for the low quality(to save bandwidth of my computer) and choppy frame-rate(recorder&#39;s fault. Couldn&#39;t record the frames fast enough because it was multi-tasking many other things as well. [url=http://kloplop321.doesntexist.org/blockglitch/]http://kloplop321.doesntexist.org/blockglitch/[/url] that is on my computer, there will be one poppup because of a free ip cloak thing. But there it is. Also there is weird music on it, because, this is just weird  :P</description>
