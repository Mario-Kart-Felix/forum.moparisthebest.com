    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-old-you-should-be-to-play-rs-or-rsps/309799</link>
    <description>so i was wondering how old do YOU think someone needs to be to play rs or rsps id say 7+ but you know only my opinion, but i will not be voting so it doesn&#39;t really matter.    



i put a new option some people agreed and it made me think that too</description>

<p>Scape-Java, i believe that Runescape lost it’s classical feel. Jagex wanted to keep up with all of the new graphics that was coming out and they made a bad mistake. Runescape-HD is horrible, i miss the old interfaces and the fun with friends, Runescape, Lan party with friends, Starbucks coffee, cigars, bud light and a whole lot of fun. I still play Runescape from time to time and i am gradually getting 99 attack, but most of my friends quit when the good wilderness was removed, it isn’t the same anymore and that ticks me off.</p>
<p>I hope in the near future Jagex will release some kind of update where we will able to go back to the old interfaces and enjoy the classical feel so we can all relax, the wilderness is gone but if they bring back the old interfaces as an option im sure it will take quite a bit of anger off of our shoulders so we can finally relax.<br>

              <p>Personally i would have an idea for a new community to be a mature based one, you sign up, you are interviewed by a Admin, or a GM and you would discuss how you would act towards others in the community, and be put on a probationary period, and let the outcome be determined by the staff member, and if necessary other members of the community.</p>
<p>It would have to be moderated by a certain few staff members that have a maturity level high enough to determine if the individual applying to be apart of the community should be aloud to stay there. Even though this would have a mature outcome it would be long and tedious and the people would have to be extremely dedicated to have a community full of mature posters that understand the outcome of their actions, and if they had good actions they would have good consequences.</p>
