<p>lol empty is an admin ofcourse he’d say that. I played the game as Chaos in-game name, but they have this MASSIVE gamebreaking bug, which unfortunately ruins it for the server. It freezes your character in place for around 8 hours out of the day, and i was listening to the admins talk with another player, and they said it was to be fixed in “today’s patch”, next day, still freezing. They know what is causing the bug, an xmas map, but they cant or simply won’t fix it. If they can just get this INSANE bug fixed, it would be great. When I did manage to actually give it a go, omg it was fun, just simple fun, not ridiculous 99 in 5minutes kinda server, it doesnt take like an hour to get a 99, but its a decent time so you still feel like you’ve earned your skillcape. community is friendly. hope they fix the bug, this server could be wonderful.</p>
