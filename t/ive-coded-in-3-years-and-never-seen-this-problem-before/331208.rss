<p>Ok this is one thing you can do:</p>
<p>look into your client.java and study the ignore cases you changed your name to. Test if something is wrong by making another account and playing on it for a bit. See if it also laggs you. Also, try using different clients.</p>

<p>ok there r 2 reasons for that either u put a source frm runescape into urs or ur using a 562 because all 562 are 80% rs and 20% private server runescape walking is gay now since they added all these new stuff u would take a step in 2-5 sec takes another thats the reason why i quite rs and started rsps</p>
