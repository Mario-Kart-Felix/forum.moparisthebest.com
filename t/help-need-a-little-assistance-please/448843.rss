              <p>i wasn’t saying he should start there but really i haven’t had any problems with my delta or devo i had made back in the day im on a delta rs remake atm and doing pretty well i have just found delta and devo easier for me to read from pi all-star and many many others i have dled and grabbed bits of code i knew and remade them for devo or delta but as the rest said it would be best to try basic java before entering a rsps (rsps is java) but to easier understand the voids and other many things included in the files a simple java calc or something would be a lil better i just hope your not like me i cant sit and read a book to learn this i have to do it in time so that’s my reason for just jumping head first into this but the more power to you if you can would make this a lot easier for sure</p>

I started out with terrible servers, and I turned out just fine<br>
Edit: But I also stopped RSPS’s for awhile to learn java.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span><br>
I would sill agree with him though, I didn’t learn java very well, instead just how to program deltascape based servers, so if I were to switch over to something such as hyperion, PI, shard, etc. I didn’t have the slightest idea of what to do. So I recommend you start out with java, not RSPS.</p>

<p>the way i found sorta easy was to download a devo or delta i find those easier for me to understand and just start messing with stuff inside id start with the commands there easy to understand for the most part you wont find much help on learn code from this community other then start with hello world.java but for more piratical things just find a pi or devo (i say pi cuz everyone’s doing it and all hate delta for reasons) and just scroll down in client.java and just see if you can understand stuff its not a hard language to learn but at first it will be its taken me a long time to understand it to learn about adding different things</p>

</aside>
<p>Learning to program from a Devolution or Delta server is a bad idea. The server it’s self has a horrible architectural design and the code inside of it looks like a 10 year old who just switched over from a QWERTY keyboard wrote it. They’re notorious for teaching bad convention habits as well.</p>
<p>What I personally and many others would recommend is starting to program outside of RuneScape Private Servers (You can still develop them, but I would focus on things outside of them in the mean time) Try starting off with basic text based rpgs or writing calculators, hell even irc bots teach you to program. Just stay away from Delta or Devolution until you even have the slightest clue as to what you’re doing.</p>
