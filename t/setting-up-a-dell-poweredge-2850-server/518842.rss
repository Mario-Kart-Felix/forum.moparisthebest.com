    <title>Setting up a Dell PowerEdge 2850 Server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-up-a-dell-poweredge-2850-server/518842</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;m having a issue with this god forsaken server. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong anymore.
Here&#39;s some of it&#39;s specs:
Dual 3.40 Ghz Processors (I do not know if it&#39;s Intel or what ever.)
6 HDD&#39;s with ~146Gb&#39;s on them each.
6Gb of RAM.

I got the server for free, including all the contents. I have access to Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2008 (R2 and plain); plus a bunch others but I don&#39;t know them all, they are all legal and real copies.
Yestarday I just finished formatting all the drives and setting up RAID. On drives 0 and 1 I set it to RAID 1 (Mirroring), this is for the OS, in case one fails, it has a back up. The other 4 are set up to RAID 5 (Striping with parity). Again, this is in case something fails.
Now I need to get an OS onto it. I cannot install via USB, which really kills me considering I have no more DVD&#39;s. However, I just made a Windows 2012 disc and a Windows 08 disc.
Neither want to work. If I run the 2012 one it gives me an error saying I&#39;m missing some dll file. If I run the 08 one it jumps to blue screen saying:
STOP: c0002e3 Security Accounts Manager initialization failed because of the following error:
Unmapped Error
Error Status: 0x0000001
Please click OK to shutdown this system and reboot into Safe Mode, check the event log for more detailed information.

I cannot click anything, there is no safe mode, and the event log would only be there if I had a OS.

How do I get this shit working.</description>

<p>They are 100% legal. Have you heard of Dreamspark? It’s a thing ran by windows. I have access to server downloads, I have to download the .iso and burn them to disc.</p>
