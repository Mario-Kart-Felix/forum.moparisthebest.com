    <title>What to do after portforwarding?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-to-do-after-portforwarding/355710</link>
    <description>Okay so every one always makes these guides on how to make a RSPS but they never tell you what to do after you portforward. I have found no guide that shows you how to get your server online. 

Which files do you change on your source and client to make it your ip? No one goes through this and I need help with it. Can someone please help me with this stuff? Thank you.

EDIT: Can someone please help me? I&#39;m sure its not that hard to tell me which files to edit and what not.</description>

              <p>In your client folder, Find EGUI.java (or Gui.java) and search something like 127.0.0.1 or localhost. Change that to your server IP. Then upload your client so people can get it and connect to your server. To run your server go to your Server files and click the run.bat to start your server.</p>
