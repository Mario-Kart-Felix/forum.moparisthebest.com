    <title>Darkthrone recruiter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/darkthrone-recruiter/218654</link>
    <description>Well, when I used to play DT a lot, the only good recruiter I knew of was [url=http://www.videogames.ro/bt2/bbb.htm]this[/url], but the problem was it was a fixed rows/columns recruiter. A friend mentioned DT a few days ago so I started googling for another recruiter(to use with SCAR, of course) and I really didn&#39;t find any as good as [url=http://www.videogames.ro/bt2/bbb.htm]this[/url], but my screen resolution is 1680x1050, there&#39;s no way I could recruit 350 times in a nice amount of time on a 5x4 recruiter, so, I downloaded the source, cleaned it up a bit, added some php and what do you know, just 12kb in 3 files and I&#39;ve made a nice recruiter with unlimited rows/columns.
