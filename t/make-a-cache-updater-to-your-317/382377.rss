    <title>Make a cache updater to your 317!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-a-cache-updater-to-your-317/382377</link>
    <description>Hello everyone.
I want to create a cache updater for my server.
You know what I mean the Searching updates on startup thing.
I want to have an updater in my client so whenever I have a new model it downloads the new cache automatically. 
Does anyone know how to do that?
I have seen lots of servers who do it. But i never found a tutorial on it.
I hope someone can help me thanks in advance, Artegoworld owner :D
Ps what I actually mean is how to use the updater.java thing?</description>
