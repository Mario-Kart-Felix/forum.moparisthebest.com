    <title>Heres my proxy list and info regarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/heres-my-proxy-list-and-info-regarding/2431</link>
    <description>I&#39;m tired of people asking about this. I shoudnt even be doing this, but mabey 1% of the useless dribble can be un-noobified from this forum. I&#39;ll make is short and sweet. 

replace address and port below with proxy(socks 5 only, but socks4 seem to work equally well). put this code into a text document. go to save as, type = all files. save it as &quot;&quot;.bat.  

@echo off
title Running Bot
java -DsocksProxyHost=proxy address -DsocksProxyPort=proxyport -noverify -Xmx500m -cp .;./OUTPUT;./OUTPUT/unrenamed.jar;./BotClasses; Bot
pause

(for you nobs, this code is not broken and should never &quot;break&quot;)

[code]@echo off
title Running Bot
java -DsocksProxyHost=72.174.30.200 -DsocksProxyPort=3388 -noverify -Xmx500m -cp .;./OUTPUT;./OUTPUT/unrenamed.jar;./BotClasses; Bot
pause[/code]

If your concerned aboot speed of proxys / using more than 1. I would advise this program

http://www.shareup.com/Anonymous_Guest_Professional-download-708.html

its freeware, you can add in proxys and check what kind they are, their speed, and all that junk

just grab my txt file included ( like 100 or some us based proxys, most suck but some get over 1000 sometimes ) feel free to add your own to the list and use at will.

in anonymouse guest : Load, then find the text doc, selecet it. and there you go, 100 proxys. then click test/all and it will run through, showing you which proxys work and which dont and their relative speeds.

Just use the code above with the fastest proxy instead. 

******** FAQ

1) I am noob does proxy make me no ban k thx? All a proxy does it hide your ip address from jagsex ( Whenever using a new proxy log in and out once, then check to make sure your ip is changed ) It adds no detectability nor makes autoing your main safe. It just makes it impossible for jagex to associate aryan with your ip and any accounts you have on it, clean or otherwise

2) I get error plox, did proxy code change h4x? No, its probably your aryan. Since i myself am a noob, I dont know the technicalities. But if something major happens it will most definitely be brought forward in this forum

3) Bah proxys are for noobs i like aryan like i like my sex, unprotected. Am i 1337? We keep getting mixed messaged about ip bannings, but my main just got banned for &quot;unsupported client&quot; which i think was due to me creating accounts with aryan not under proxy. So Do what you will, better safe than sorry ey?

4) why did u even bother posting something so easy nubbinz? You would be suprised...
