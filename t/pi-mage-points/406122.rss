    <title>[PI] Mage Points</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-mage-points/406122</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to make my &quot;Mage Points&quot; work on a PI based server.
Well, when you go to Mage Bank, Kolodoin, teleports you to the mage arena, and you kill battle mages for 1 point each.
You are supposed to redeem those points for items from the Chamber Guardian, but the Chamber Guardian SELLS the items that are supposed to be redeemed by the points. So instead of say, 30 points for an infinity top, it costs 4m.
Help would be appreciated.</description>

              <p>Alright, so what your saying is you want a shop to use your mage points on? If so, ill give you a few basic instructions that might help as it is probably to hard to explain via posting.</p>
<p>1.) Go to your source and search for “Shop Assistant”,  scroll down to the bottom were it usualy is, and you will see special shop codes for the pkpoint shop and slayerpoint shop or w.e, you need to make another special shop item value code like that.</p>
<p>2.) Copy and paste one of the special item value shop codes and change the value to +magePoints+ or whatever. Like i said this is really hard to explain ver chat, but i could assist you further if you give me your teamviewer ID.</p>
