IF YOUVE READ THE LAST POST

ok so im assuming(assuming is bad) that my jdk code is correct and ive done ecverything else(cuz i have done everthing) i still cant run the server....so im going to ask a stupid question and say are you supposed to try to run the &quot;source&quot; that you downloaded in step 2?
      And if its the sources problem is it still ok(after ive done everything) to try and get a new source?
