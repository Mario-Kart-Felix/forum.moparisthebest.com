    <title>Prestige Mode</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/prestige-mode/200052</link>
    <description>Many of us have played Call of Duty 4 and I was wondering about an idea that is possible to make.  What do you people think about me making a server feature or a &quot;tutorial&quot; where you rank up in a number of specific skills (such as all 3 melee skills) or max all your skills out all the way.  Then, a message pops up saying, &quot;Congratulations, you are now legible for Prestige Mode, click the next button to continue.&quot; The next menu would probably say something like, &quot;Prestige Mode is a very rewarding system, allowing you to show off your achievements, but be aware, entering Prestige Mode will reset your [certain] stats.&quot;.  Then, if you agreed to enter Prestige Mode, by typing in some command listed on the next page of the interface, you would now have a Prestige icon next to your player name.  Like how administrators and moderators have a crown next to their names, you would have a prestige icon that differs on your prestige level.  This could easily be implemented, but I am not entirely sure on making about 9 prestige sprites.  I just wanted to know what people thought or if I was just having a crazy thought.</description>
