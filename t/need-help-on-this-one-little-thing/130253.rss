    <title>Need help on this one little thing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-on-this-one-little-thing/130253</link>
    <description>Well, i was adding Gem cutting just like real Rs.
I added all gems + the shilo gems but when copmiling i got some erros.

When i was coding this i already knew this was going to give me errors but i said i&#39;d finish it first and then i would try to fix it.
This is what i am getting the error on.
[code]		addSkillXP(67,5, 12);[/code]
Cutting the gem would give me 67,5Xp
But i cant use a , to get to 67,1/2
I tryd doing this
[code]		addSkillXP(67.5, 12);[/code]
As you can see i now used a period instead of a comma.
But still i got the same error.

What would i need to type to make it give me 67,5 (67,1/2) Xp?
Please help.</description>
