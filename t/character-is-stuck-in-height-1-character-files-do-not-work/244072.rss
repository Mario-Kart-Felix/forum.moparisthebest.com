    <description>I really didn&#39;t want to make another thread but i know u probably wouldn&#39;t look at the other one again


My character is stuck in Height = 1

I tried changing it back to 0 in character files, but it still resets to 0 everytime i log back on


Do not tell me to change the character files or i will get really mad..</description>
