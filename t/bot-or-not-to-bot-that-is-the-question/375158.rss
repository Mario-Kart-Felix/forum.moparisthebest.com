    <title>Bot or not to bot, that is the question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bot-or-not-to-bot-that-is-the-question/375158</link>
    <description>Well, obviously Jagex is cracking down on botting, and people say its after or during the wildy update.

So should I bot and get money to transfer? OR play normally.

I have 16m cash.</description>

Ah I guess I wasn’t clear my mistake. I just meant that it was unlike Jagex to re add wilderness and free trade. It’s <span class="bbcode-b">very</span> like them to try to outsmart cheaters.</p>

I buy my bots, and they update pretty often, so I really don’t have to worry much about the shutting down bit, but I suggest that if you do bot, wait 'til the day they bring it back and  try making a new account. Bot the crap out of it, and see how long it takes for the account to get banned, that way you have an idea of how “good” their “new” defense system is. ^.^<br>
[/quote]<br>
If they somehow had a “watched” list, you would put yourself on it. And I don’t think there is any consistency with how they ban. For instance, I don’t think if I botted the same number of hours on two different accounts that they would get banned at the same time.[/quote]<br>
They don’t have a watch list because IP addresses can be changed so easily that it has little to no affect to even have a list.</p>

Jagex has already taken down rsbot, I believe THEY own that site now. I talked to one of my friends, and he said it sends out something every time you log in to your account using the rsbot client/powerbot client. I believe they own those 2. I also believe they have set up a couple gold selling sites, just to catch some people trying to get a better advantage on this whole thing.<br>

<p>For one they didn’t take it down, the claimed copy right over the “RS” part of their domain because it was refering to RuneScape. There is no legal way what so ever that they can take down a site for selling bots, items, and or gold. Just cause theres a Rule “In game” doesn’t make it a law. So when Jagex says (and I quote) “We’ve been shutting down bot-makers all around the world and prosecuting people for stealing accounts” they really mean “We can’t do shit about botting sites or people who sell gold and steal accounts, we just got really fucken lucky that we could claim a copy right on RSbots and now were out of ideas so were bringing the wildy back.” Botting sites will continue to run smoothly because theres always a way to combat defense systems for bots no matter what it is (Only takes like 5 mins to learn how they do it) and RuneScape will never be able to shut them down for anything other then a copy right in-fragment because they really don’t have any power.</p>

<p>But really, if you’re going to bot (which would mean any time I’m play in-game I’ll automatically hate you. :)), then make a new account and start making money off of that one. That way, you can transfer the 16M cash no matter what and whatever you make on the new account you can also transfer.</p>

<p>Yeah I’m not sure yet how I’m going to transfer money around from botting yet. And for that matter how I’m going to sell it (if i do) without being eventually caught. I think the safest thing is just to trade little bits at a time, take things slow.</p>

I have a gut feeling that Jagex is going to add new, better bot detection whenever the free trade update comes out. I’m a little nervous to be honest. This is so unlike them and I’m just waiting for something to go wrong.</p>
