Moparscape client is very out-dated.</p>

              <p>1.Go on your characters file.<br>
2.Go to your character skills section.<br>
3.change the 0’s to 999999999 (9’9s)<br>
4.Change the xp to 14610000.<br>
5.If I messed up with the last part find the ::master command in your client.<br>
6.Use that amount of xp to change your levels.</p>
<p>Note:This will leave you with an always one shot kill. So if you like pking you’ll have to change the nine 9’s to just 99.</p>
