    <description>Make sure to show respect to the people that serve the countries to protect the liberties of their people. Even if you don&#39;t agree with all of the wars, it&#39;s not them that chose which wars to fight!


Also, who do you have in the armed forces in your close family?

I have both of my grandparents (one of whom passed away about a year ago) who served in WWII, and an uncle that served in Vietnam.</description>

Well said, although its not possible in times like these their is almost always another peaceful/less harmful way to resolve things.<br>
People shouldn’t be proud of the military, people should be sad that their is a need for the military.</p>

<p>Leave it at that then, don’t bother bringing anything up. All its doing is causing issues on a thread where it isn’t needed. Go start a topic where its centered around the current state of affairs when it comes to war. Don’t do it on a thread that actually deserves to be here.</p>

Make sure to show respect to the people that serve the countries to protect the liberties of their people. Even if you don’t agree with all of the wars, it’s not them that chose which wars to fight!<br>
[/quote][/quote]not entirely true though</p>
<p>You aren’t forced to. Just don’t show up. What are they going to do? Dishonorably discharge you? THAT"S WHAT YOU WANT. At the most, you will go to prison for like a year until your contract is up. Hey guess what, that one year you could be using it to get a free education yay prison rocks!</p>
<p>= profit??</p>

Yes, because the Vietnams would kill you, take from your freedom and they would do this with mind power.<br>
No, if you think the millitary is invading countries to protect you, you are a bloody idiot.</p>
<p>If you stop people like Hitler and Napoleon, you are a hero. Because you are the defender.</p>
