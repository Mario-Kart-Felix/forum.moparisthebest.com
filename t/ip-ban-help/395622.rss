    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ip-ban-help/395622</link>
    <description>Hi im not to sure if this is in the right section , sorry if its not but here i go.....
i have a 317 server  running on a hp proliant server i have given the client out to a few people to try

two of thenm can connect with no problems and its looking good
but one of the gets the your ip in banned message when he trys to log on, i have checked the ipban logs and nothing?

i team viewed him and tried to ping server but timed out?

would you say this is a firewall issue , its just that the ipban mesage is i think sending me up the garded path
i would have thought that the message would have come up as cant connect to server or something?


we have tried a different client/server and he can connect same port 43594 sam ip?

any help would be realy appriciated</description>
