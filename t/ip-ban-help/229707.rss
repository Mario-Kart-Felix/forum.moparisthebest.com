    <title>IP Ban help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ip-ban-help/229707</link>
    <description>[code] if(checkbannedips() == 5) {
  returnCode = 4;
  System.out.println(playerName+&quot; failed to logon because their ip is banned.&quot;);
  appendToLR(playerName+&quot; failed to logon because their ip is banned.&quot;);
  savefile = false;
  disconnected = true;[/code]

This is basicly what I have, and I have a bannedips.txt also. When I insert the IP into the .txt file, it says on my server runner, &quot;player failed to logon because their ip is banned&quot; and yet, they still log on.

Also, I saw this code around forums and wondering how I can get it to work,
[code]if (!connectingHost.equals(&quot;The guys host address here&quot;)) {[/code]
I put it in the server.java, but I don&#39;t know what to put under it for a disconnect\ban.

My IP ban command is working, and it puts the players IP in bannedips.txt, but the error above keeps happening.

Help would be thanked.
