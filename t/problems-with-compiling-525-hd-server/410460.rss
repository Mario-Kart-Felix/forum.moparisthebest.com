    <title>Problems with compiling 525 HD Server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-compiling-525-hd-server/410460</link>
    <description>Hello everyone!

I am currently having problems trying to compile a 525 HD Server. I am using a Client + Source (Dannyskape). The Client and Source runs 100% perfectly smooth, but i try to compile things, and all the Command Prompt (The black interface) says is this:

Compiling rs2hd/*.java
The device is not ready.
rs2hd/*.java complete
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
The device is not ready
Press any key to continue...

Can anyone please help me and solve my problem? I&#39;d be so grateful if someone did :)

Thanks for reading :),
