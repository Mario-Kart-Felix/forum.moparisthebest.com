There is much more to explore and for people to try out for. So here are the positions im allowing. Note that even if you recive the position, your powers will still be strictly limited.

[size=10pt]Forum Moderator:[/size]
This position will have powers on the forum, and website. You will have to know basic knowlede of PHP and know your way around a Ucoz site. You may have to know a little javascript also. For more info., PM me, Ill tell you more about the forums, and Ill send you the link.

[size=10pt]Commercial Administrator:[/size]
You will have the job of collecting players. This is a very important job. You must have knowledge with making banners, videos, and anything else you feel you need to know. You will have to go around and do your best to catch players eyes.

[size=10pt]Server Moderator[/size]
This job will have extremely restricted powers. But is still one of the most powerful. You will be moderator in-game, you need to know a good amount of javascript, as well as know your way around a VPS. You will be in-charge of keeping the in-game server at peace. 


If any of these postions seem right for you, feel free to PM me. I will pm you back ASAP with the links for whatever postion you want. Make sure you are clear on what you wish you do. You must also pass a small interview. Just so I can make sure I can trust you, or make sure your not an idiot. :)

Thanks for reading.
