    <title>Packet Handling Issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/packet-handling-issues/536264</link>
    <description>Hey there, I&#39;ve been toying around with Xenorune and found that the examining of items on the equip items interface (the one with stat bonuses) is not handled, I handled this packet (which was 9) and got rid of the line that appears in the console saying that there is an unhandled packet. However this shows up:

[2013/11/30 08:19:21] [AnonymousIoService-2]: Unkown length: 9, guessed to be: 6.

And the examining isn&#39;t working. Im wondering what the hell this &quot;unknown length: 9&quot; stuff is and why it matters, cuz I handled the bloody packet.</description>
