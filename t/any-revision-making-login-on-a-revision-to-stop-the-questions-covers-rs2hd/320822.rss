    <description>[CENTER]Hey, well the first time i tried making login i bugged a lot of people. TRUST ME. ask mystic flow and laz and others. i finally did it, back when rs was 569, and i had posted lots of help threads trying to figure it out. This tutorial is just to tell you how to make login.

Difficulty: 4-5, 2 if you know what you are doing.

Requirements: A deobed client, a server(i will be converting z508 to 554, and rs2hd to 569.) and an intermediate to advanced knowledge of java.
Optional Requirements: A Java IDE(Such as Eclipse, which i use, or NETBEANS.)

Credits: Everyone who helped me to get login the very first time i did it. tim for showing me how pali&#39;s login works. and me for explaining it all in this tutorial. :)

Ok, so to start, i will explain that you will need to be looking at the client. now this means that you will be comparing parts of the code to other clients.

Here is a little checklist that we are going to need to do.
[code]
[COLOR=&quot;Orange&quot;][B]the sendWindowPane packet(Allows the main game screen to show.)
the sendMapRegion packet(Allows the server to send the player&#39;s area, meaning it loads the XTEA from the mapdata folder.)
disable all other packets.[/B][/COLOR]
[/code]

[SPOILER=&quot;Client Stuff&quot;][COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]Read this:[/COLOR] [url=http://www.rune-server.org/showthread.php?t=182269&amp;highlight=stream]http://www.rune-server.org/showthread.php?t=182269&amp;highlight=stream[/url]

that tutorial will help to identify &quot;Streams&quot; that you will be using.
also this text document may help you.
[code]
k to find signlink you would search for &quot;public EventQueue&quot; using a search through all files feature

to find fileondisk you just search for &quot;fileondisk&quot; throughout the files

to find packetparser you just search for &quot;T1

to find stream you just search for &quot;modpow&quot;



//569
Class162 - SignLink
Class119 - FileOnDisk

Class70_Sub8 - PacketParser - frames
Class175 - SecondaryPacketParser (Idk thats what I call it)

Class153_Sub8 - Stream
Class153_Sub8_Sub1 - PacketStream
Class153_Sub8_Sub2 - RawStream

Class141 - Cryption

Class95 - Animation
Class92 - login

Class122_Sub5_Sub2_Sub1 - NPC
Class122_Sub5_Sub2_Sub2 - Player
Class122_Sub5_Sub2 - Entity

Class198_Sub1 - PlayerUpdateMasks
Class153_Sub36_Sub18 - NpcUpdateMasks
[/code]

[COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]Step one:[/COLOR] [B]Finding the login class.[/B]

There is really no point in me showing you how to find the login class, as it changes between revisions, but just look at other clients to figure it out.

[COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]Step two:[/COLOR] [B]Finding the login block.[/B]

the login block always contains += 50 because of the Isaac. thanks to serenity for posting this. so just search += 50 inside of the login method.

[COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]Step three:[/COLOR] [B]Identifying the Stream class, and identifying streams.
[/B]

Use the file above to find the stream class, and the tutorial i linked to find the streams. once you have done this go to step 4.

[COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]Step four:[/COLOR] [B]Reading the login block[/B]

Now that you have identified many streams, you should now go back to the login block, and read what it says
for example, readUnsignedByte in a client would be addByte((byte) 0) or addByte((byte) 1) in a server.
readString would be addString(&quot;&quot;) or addString(stringnamehere); in a server
ect. you just have to read the login block. in the server, replace what the current loginblock is with what you have found.[/SPOILER][/CENTER]</description>
