    <description>Well i really no nothing about bot making and i have no idea if this would work with runescape but what about making something like the bot OpenKore for rune scape. If you dont know what OpenKore is its a bot for the game Ragnarok Online. Basicly what it dose is just send packets and thats it no using of the game client(unless you want to there is a mode you can set so you can watch it bot) But they have like a packet collector of sorts so like when you log in and play it save&#39;s all the packet data for like attacking loging in moving all that. So then (im not really sure this is how it works because i didnt creat the bot or do anything but) I think once they have all the packets they did something so that it would send the packets how you pleased...Dont quote me on this because i did not creat or help creat any of this bot. Well this is just an idea i guess and this way we wouldnt need there client at all...anyways the website is [url=http://www.openkore.com]www.openkore.com[/url] you can check out the forums and the documentation maybe even say on there your wanting to creat a bot for a diffrent game and maybe they would tell you how they did it somewhat I don&#39;t know just an idea I guess.</description>

see there is this bot called glider what it does is read what the packets say and determine (bad spelling) where to click and what to do but this bot is for world of warcraft now this kinda sounds like what u were saying…the site is <a href="http://Wowglider.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Wowglider.com</a> if u want to see<br>

<p>I somewhat agree with this but if you saw what they do with OpenKore it is amazing this bot has been around for years and is constantly updated it is really quite amazing.</p>
<p>I thought glider read memory addresses?</p>
<p>But the thing is, we’re probably the most advanced cheating community (in terms of tactics) of just about any MMO. I was on a WoW forum the other day and they were astonished that Blizzard has started analysing play style in addition to using warden results to search for cheaters <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thanks to Jagex we’ve developed human-ish mouse movements, random HLH-style breaks, encryption workarounds, and anti-obfuscation tools. We have complete access to the client’s environment information without resorting to packet parsing. I have yet to find a bot short of d2jsp that could equal some of the stuff that RuneScape cheaters turn out, though admittedly I don’t play online games very much and there seems to be a general consensus to not develop bots for Guild Wars (which I occasionally play). Glider seems to be very popular though - is it really that advanced or is it just the only option?[/quote]</p>

              <p>Well not sure if this is wrong or right but like even if it updated the bot would only crash if it intercepeted the new packets from the update… so you could like still bot the same monsters/trees/ores…unless every update they changed the packets somehow every time…and then when they updated people could run around with the packet collector and get the new data…just release the packet collector to everyone and be like if you use this bot use this too… or I donno im just going off what I sorta no not much about</p>
