    <title>Complicated Java homework</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/complicated-java-homework/383346</link>
    <description>So i procrastinated on my java hw thinking the other hw&#39;s took me half an hour to do so this one will be easy. Its due in about an hour and a half.

The hw:
Create a Java class to represent a rental car. Name the class RentalCar. Include
following private properties as specified data type. Note all properties MUST be private,
for the sake of security.
VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)--string
 Make--string
Model--string
Classification--char
Rental (Basic Rental Per Day)--double
MileNum (number of miles, i.e. odometer reading, not mileage charge)--int
Include the following public methods. Spell the names exactly as specified and use the
same number and types of parameters in the same order.
 A constructor with no parameter that does nothing
 A constructor with six parameters representing above six properties. It should
initialize six properties with corresponding parameters.
 A public void method named print to display all information with appropriate
prompt. For example, for VIN, print “VIN of the car: xxxx”.
A public void method named setmiles to accept a number of miles as a parameter
and assign that value to MileNum property.
A public method named getmiles that returns the number of miles
Note that none of these methods should accept keyboard input.
Write your own test class, named TestRentalCar, that will read all information from the
keyboard. The test class should test all of the methods. Note that only this class can have
main method. And your source file (java file) should have the identical name, i.e.
TestRentalCar.java. You SHOULD put both classes in this java file.

Talk about complicated as hell.</description>
