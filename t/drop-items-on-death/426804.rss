    <title>Drop items on death</title>

    <description>I have a simple problem that I have no clue about. The guy I bought the source from said he has it on &quot;Safe&quot; mode when pking so you don&#39;t loose your items when you pk because it was in beta testing and he refuses to tell me how to change it if you have any clue I would appreciate it!
It is a [PI] server by the way.
