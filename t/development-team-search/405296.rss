    <title>Development Team Search?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/development-team-search/405296</link>
    <description>  Hey guys, I&#39;ve been studying Java for almost a year now, read a few books on it, worked on a few projects. However, I know this much, learning Java and working on projects can be a whole lot more fun when you have a team of some-sort to do it with. So that&#39;s where my question comes.

   Do you guys know of any place, site, that I could got to find some sort of development team (maybe even low-level). I&#39;m not really looking to work on private servers right now, which is why I&#39;m not asking for any teams on here.

   Thanks.</description>

<p>I’m sure there would be a few people on this site willing to start a development team with you, not private server related of course. I’ve been noticing more members are drifting away from the RS2 Emulation and going towards more practical programming. You could try the Oracle Community Forums, but most of their member base is professional.(As in they program for a living, not necessarily good at it.) I would be willing to start something with you if you have any good ideas in mind.</p>

<p>I appreciate the help. That’s some of the main reasons why I can’t really turn to Java-Forums, or Oracle because most of the people that use those forums commonly are people that work on Java as a profession, much more advanced then myself.</p>
<p>I’ll send you a private message regarding us as a team.</p>

I’m just asking where I can find development teams out there. I’m just giving my experience and don’t have much interest in making private servers?</p>
