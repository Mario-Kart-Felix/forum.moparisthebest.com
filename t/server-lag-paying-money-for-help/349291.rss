    <title>Server Lag?!?!?!?! (PAYING MONEY FOR HELP!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-lag-paying-money-for-help/349291</link>
    <description>Ok I play a server called globalpkz. But I have a problem on it.... When I teleport it takes 10 minutes to load. Or when I log in it takes 10 minutes to load, same with loading screens. All I have on my computer is java, winrar, cclear, and Globalpkz. My computer is up to date, and my internet provider is comcast. What seems to be the problem???? If you can fix my problem, I will give you 10 reps, making 9 new accs to rep you. And I will also give you $45. No one else seems to have this problem but me. The owner has a great vps, and the cache is fine. I can&#39;t seem to get the webclient to load either, aswell, IM THE ONLY ONE WITH THESE PROBLEMS!!!!!!
PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</description>
