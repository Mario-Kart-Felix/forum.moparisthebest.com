              <p>So, I don’t know what system you have (makes it very difficult to help) but you can add 3 more rows into your MySQL database by going into your phpmyadmin, click on the name of the database where your highscores are stored, go into it’s table.<br>
From there scroll down almost all the way to the bottom and find where it says “Add” and put 3 in the box instead of 1 for columns. I would select to add them at the end of the table.<br>
After you click go you’ll be directed to a page with a bunch of prompts.<br>
In the name field, substitute spaces with underscores and I’d go with all lowercase.<br>
PKP and PK kills will be ints, and KDR will be a decimal.<br>
From there I believe you can hit continue.<br>
That should make the 3 columns you need.</p>
<p>The next part I can’t help without knowing how you’re sending the data to your database, and also your php code.</p>
