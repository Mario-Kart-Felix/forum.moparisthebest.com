    <description>k well recentlly ive been working on a pvp system for m 317 server, [delta] and so far i go the whole map pvp, multi , but i can figure out how to make the player lose all their items, for some reason all players keep their items. also i was wondering if it was possible to make a ::pvp command to enable pvp and ::nopvp for players that dont want to pvp. e.g, if someone types ::pvp that means him/her and all other players that used that, can attack eachother. any help plz :D</description>
