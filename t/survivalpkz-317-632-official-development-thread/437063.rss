[b]Server will hopefully be up within 24 hours, currently having some jarring issues.[/b]
[/center]

Hello there MoparScape, I know how shit goes around here, so I know I&#39;ll get flamed with people saying &quot;PI&#39;s are too mainstream&quot; &quot;PI&#39;s are unstable&quot; blah blah blah, well, you can lick my ass. 

[center][b]Blame the programmer, not the base.[/b][/center]

[b]About Me:[/b]
I&#39;m Ruby, I&#39;m almost 17, I&#39;m not a java programmer, therefore I&#39;m just learning. I chose PI due to the large amount of tutorials available, also, the user-friendly file layout. I&#39;ve worked on this for a few months now, but I feel I can no longer put anything into it. I&#39;m a website designer and forums developer, mainly specialising in css, but I&#39;d consider myself pretty good at jscript, php and mysql scripts as well. I&#39;ve run and developed several RuneScape Private Servers and I enjoy it immensely. I have work and everything to keep up with with college now, so this is why I&#39;m looking for developers.


[b]About SurvivalPkz:[/b]
SurvivalPkz used to be around about 9-10 months ago, I got to about 120 online. It wasn&#39;t anything spectacular, it was just a user-friendly base, with a user-friendly site and a friendly community. I made my updates due to what the players wanted, not what I wanted. That&#39;s how this will be run also. At SurvivalPkz, we care more about the player than we do our updates. [i]You must understand and respect this[/i].


[b]Current Team:[/b]
As some of you may know, I was a developer of Prothieum. This has just shut down due to the owner not having the desire to run a RuneScape Private Server. I have taken 2 of their developers with me as my development team. But I need more. I have a full staff team and a 20ish playerbase ready to host on. We just need the help of moparscapes community&#39;s developers.

Owner - Me.
Website Developer - Me.
Java Developer - Jovanni, Arrogance, space, space, space.
Head Administrator - Exile
Head Moderator - Mute Spittah
Moderators - Big Plays, Swish, Nox.
[/center]

[b]Why do you ask for developers now?:[/b]
I ask for developers now because as I&#39;ve stated before, I have a lot going on in my life. I&#39;m currently a first year apprentice wind turbine and electrical technician, so I have college coming along with that as well, I have time to run an RSPS, just not time to solely develop it. I was taking on Jovanni and Arrogance anyway, who are both pretty good programmers by the way, so I thought &quot;why not?&quot; and just went full out into recruiting 3 other developers to all work in unison and give Project Insanity a great name, and of course, give the players a great private server to play.

[b]How can I apply?:[/b]
You can apply by filling out the following form:
[code]
Name:
Age:
TimeZone: +/- GMT
Previous Experience: (this will be checked up on)
What have you done with the Project Insanty base before:
How long can you work per day:
Do you work well in a team:
Do you have DropBox:
Skype: (must be skype, not msn)
[/code]

There are no requirements to become a developer of SurvivalPkz, but please, do [i]not[/i] think that it is easy. We at Survival are here to create a great RuneScape Private Server, many have tried, many have failed. I say fuck it, lets give it our all. If we succeed, our names will be heard all over the world of RSPS, if we don&#39;t, then it&#39;s not a loss. So lets get started!

All 317 skills 100%:

[b]FAQ[/b]
[i]Why did you incorporate such a high revision of cache?[/i]
I did this because that&#39;s what the players wanted, they wanted that old 317 feel, but with the new items. That&#39;s why there&#39;s still 317 animations and graphics, just the newer items.

[i]What is the aim of SurvivalPkz?[/i]
I aim for survivalpkz to be one of those RSPS that everyone loves. People who don&#39;t like 317 can leave for all I care, private servers originated because RuneScape got shit, at that time, they came out in 317, everyone loved them. For this case, we will continue to use 317, without changing.

[i]Why are you so devoted to your players?[/i]
I feel that the playerbase of a server tells you a lot. If there&#39;s great developers working on it, but the players are still bored, that shows me that they&#39;re not player orientated. We cannot just make a Private Server that we like, it must be a private server that everyone wants and likes, this is why the old 317 feel is there, but the new items are there for the newer players, this all makes sense, in my mind anyway.

[i]How can I show I support SurvivalPkz?[/i]
If you&#39;re using moparscape, post this as your signature:
[code]
[center]
I support [url=http://survivalpkz.com]SurvivalPkz![/url]
[b]The ultimate 317 server![/b]
[/center]
[/code]

If you&#39;re using any other community that enables images in signatures then do:
[code]
[center]
[url=http://survivalpkz.com][img]http://survivalpkz.com/css/images/logo.png[/img][/url]
[b]The ultimate 317 server![/b]
[/center]
[/code]


[b]Please, apply to be a developer of SurvivalPKz, I have a VPS ready to host on, I have a website you can find [url=http://survivalpkz.com]here.[/url] Add my skype: Ruby_Website_Developer, [i]we have the resources to be one of the best private servers there is[/i] come and be a part of SurvivalPkz today![/b]

<p><span class="bbcode-i">What is the aim of SurvivalPkz?</span><br>
I aim for survivalpkz to be one of those RSPS that everyone loves. People who don’t like 317 can leave for all I care, private servers originated because RuneScape got shit, at that time, they came out in 317, everyone loved them. For this case, we will continue to use 317, without changing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Why are you so devoted to your players?</span><br>
I feel that the playerbase of a server tells you a lot. If there’s great developers working on it, but the players are still bored, that shows me that they’re not player orientated. We cannot just make a Private Server that we like, it must be a private server that everyone wants and likes, this is why the old 317 feel is there, but the new items are there for the newer players, this all makes sense, in my mind anyway.</p>
