              <p>i had same problem like they will connect then disconnect and not be able to play<br>
if this is whats happening it is your router as the NAT would be strict therefore blocking any connection from outside your area.<br>
i had to buy a new router to fix (cause i didnt know how to change)<br>
i think you need to contact your internet provider and ask them</p>
