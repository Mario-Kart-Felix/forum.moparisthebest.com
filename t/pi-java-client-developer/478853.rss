    <description>I am looking for java, client, or website developer that has experience in one of this fields. Right now, I have a source that I have been coding for sometime, the revision is 317 with 508+ data added. I have redone and made improvements to the mini-games in which in my opinion is about 85-90% completed, just need to be re-look at and improved in my standards and the others behave. My overall improvement that I have been working on where relocating npc&#39;s, shops, home, spawns, small bugs, adding items, mini-games, clipping, specials, dupes and etc. The client is alright but going to need a bit changed, I have also jared and signed the client but think about using a different one, Don&#39;t know yet. Also been have trouble of thinking of a name but that&#39;s easy. If you have NO or SMALL experience on I will require you to do something else to be part of the team but If you are experience with one of the two contract me on Skype for more information.
