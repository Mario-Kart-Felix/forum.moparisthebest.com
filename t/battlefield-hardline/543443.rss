Visceral Games, a video game development studio part of EA, and mostly known for the Dead Space trilogy, is now developing the next game in Battlefield&#39;s series: Battlefield Hardline.  The game is going to be based off the war on crime and the battle between cops and criminals.


The game, along with many other details, will be announced at E3 2014.

What do you guys think about this?  Personally, I don&#39;t think it should be considered a Battlefield game.  And seeing how rocky Battlefield 4 still is after all this time, I don&#39;t have much hope for a new Battlefield, especially one revolving around something completely different.</description>

              <p>Yeah I have started watching more gameplay, this looks boring as shet.</p>
<p>Badcompany 2 was, imo, super bad ass. BF3 had its glitches for overall the experience was pretty damn great. BF4 took a while to get used to, still pretty much a disappointment due to the connection issues and the fact that reloading helicopter ammunition is absolutely bullshit.</p>

<p>I still believe that it should be considered a battlefield game even though it is by a different gaming company.  I highly enjoyed Battlefield 4’s campaign but it was kinda rocky at points (I had a lot of glitches) but never ventured to the multiplayer.</p>

              <p>Everyone says the storylines suck, but I really enjoyed them all.</p>
<p>The next main game in the BF franchise (since I’m not considering Hardline to be a main game) will probably be Bad Company 3.  The other Bad company games were relaxed and had fantastic storylines, which will hopefully be the case in the next one if they can actually release a fully working game unlike BF4.</p>

I’ve spent about $110 on the game (the base game + premium) and there is no way in hell I’m doing that every year.  Hopefully this is just a smaller title (kinda like Battlefield Play4free), and a larger main title is still being made by EA DICE and will be released fully in a few years time, basing around actual warfare, which is what I want Battlefield to be.</p>
<p>The whole cop warfare thing isn’t a bad idea, but like you said, it’s a shame they are using the Battlefield title for a whole new game.</p>

              <p>They’re starting to pump them out like CoD games. Besides feeling horribly unfamiliar, BF4 doesn’t seem to have changed any besides maybe updated textures (minimal change at best) and upgraded to 64 slot servers. They still have DLC and such to give us in BF4, so I hope this game takes a few years to be created and released, as I am going to be highly pissed off if people switch over to that &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>Sounds like they’re using the battlefield title to create a completely different game. Which is a shame, as I felt up until the abomination of BF4, it was a highly respected title.</p>
