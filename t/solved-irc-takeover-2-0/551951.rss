    <title>[SOLVED] IRC Takeover 2.0</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-irc-takeover-2-0/551951</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;Moparisthebest&quot;]Alright!  Everyone has came back together as one big happy family again! :)  Both sides agreed to some concessions and we have a great plan.  This was all set up in discussions between me, Mopman, and t4.

This is what&#39;s going to happen:

1. Mopman&#39;s and t4&#39;s servers will be linked
2. t4 will run services
3. Paid operators are gone, and will never return
4. No one will ever link other servers without extensive community agreement
5. No one will add any oper without complete approval by the full oper group (currently t4, Mopman, Niall, Tom, tL, c`p, and eXemplar)
6. t4&#39;s services/server will be backed up to my server approx weekly
7. irc.moparisthebest.com/irc.moparisthebest.com will round-robin between both servers directly, I&#39;ll also supply ssl certs

For now the DNS has been repointed to t4&#39;s server (might take a bit to propagate), but because it&#39;s super late certs and linking won&#39;t happen until tommorow at the earliest, and ssl certs afterwards (for now you&#39;ll have to accept warnings, yuck).

I think that&#39;s it, it&#39;s nice to know we are actually all adults here, and though huge misunderstandings do happen we can overcome them. :)[/quote]

[s]looks like mopman locked the original topic and:

21:55:42        Mopman | anyway this is all dumb bickering, more importantly: opers, msg me sha-256 hashes you want for your oline


DNS changed too



c`p has supplied us with DNS for this server [size=12pt][b]mopar[i].[/i]irc.camp[/b][/size] please edit your config accordingly if you wish to use the current IRCd. make sure you turn [b][size=12pt]SSL verify OFF
[/size][/b]. if that doesn&#39;t work try plaintext for now. we&#39;re in the process of deploying new SSL certs..

[size=14pt][b]moparisthebest edit: solved, resolution found here:[/b][/size]

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’m glad a decision has been made, although I’m not sure it’s the best one but I think the old adage ‘high hopes low expectations’ definitely applies here.</p>
<p>I’d like to address a couple of things around here, because I believe there have been quite a bit of hostility floating around, perpetrated by a few.</p>
<p>First of all, the ‘paid opers’. What started as a joke exemplified by Mopman’s face and the put a donk on it video seems to have really quite upset people. I don’t need to explain myself, but I feel it will give you a better understanding into a few people’s actions and motivations. After initially discussing renewal of the domain and ssl, which I have no problems with paying, people actually wanted to contribute. There were a few suggestions for ‘rewards’ for donations, including being able to gline pure on demand. It was even suggested that people then be able to be an oper on the network, and while I wasn’t really sure of this it wasn’t a binding promise or obligation and wasn’t exactly like I couldn’t remove any problem makers. After thinking it over, I also figured this was actually a much better way of determining who was potentially interested in helping and without playing any sort of favouritisim or power group/clique situation which has always proven problematic. And it worked. It actually worked, these people were interested and after it was made clear they were there to protect the network and really only had power to ban people which even then was under the oversight of existing opers. No one paid for oper, but people paid to help with operational costs and I decided to make some opers. Sure there was some teething issues, but I consider this actually quite successful. Interested people contributing to the ongoing success of the network, without favourtism (without handing over information to others out of mis-placed guilt or dodgy friendship) - but not without veto.</p>
<p>Throughout the last few days, I was made aware that a select few individuals were actively involved in continued disparaging of multiple people, and quite honestly flat out angry whinging. I’m not going to point fingers, name names, or post logs, but those people know who they are. After all the claims of god complex, takeover, power, drama, control, the loudest and most obstinate seem to be the only people who’ve had issue, and who’ve created issues. I think this arrangement is an attempt to appease a loud minority (and may even reinforce that behaviour) at the expense of the majority of people who just want to chat. These people also have copies of your hashed passwords, so I’d still suggest changing them, and for that I’d like to apologise. My failure here was trusting and linking where I shouldn’t have, and that’s where we’re heading again.</p>
<p>This is where I see the current situation as not ideal, although potentially workable as long as everyone is aware and watchful. So I hope it works out, I really do. Anyway this whole thing is long done, and should probably lock these threads before it devolves even more.</p>

              <p>Look, Mopman did not do this without consulting everyone, the bottom line is since I quit running IRC eXemplar has ran it, and he is still running it as far as I’m concerned.  He had mopman set up a new server and that’s the official server, bottom line.  You guys are welcome to come back to it (it’ll always be at <a href="http://irc.moparisthebest.com">irc.moparisthebest.com</a>), or of course you are free to just hang out someplace else, though I <em>hope</em> that isn’t what happens.</p>

<p>also whats the deal with rizon “shitlords”?
