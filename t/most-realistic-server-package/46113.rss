    <title>Most realistic Server package?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/most-realistic-server-package/46113</link>
    <description>Has anyone made a modded server package to be as real to runescape as possible? Talking NPC&#39;s? NORMAL EXP growth? Tutorial island, character creator? I know there&#39;s tons of tutorials out, but to match them all up to a single server... is there a package like that out there?</description>

<p>maby he wants his server like rs <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>RS3 anyone,private server lol.Anyways,since it’s almost impossible to make it like real RS2 or RSC,you gota hack jagex,get the codes and paste them into your server :). Or,if you can’t do that,go play on a Private server.</p>
<p>K,I know this is breaking rules but <a href="http://r00nscape.no-ip.org/info" rel="nofollow noopener">r00nscape.no-ip.org/info</a> is almost exactly like real RS,except no KBD,duel arena,but training and value etc etc are the same.Good luck.</p>
<p>PS: Maybe it has duel arena/KQ/KBD etc.</p>
<p>PPS: Don’t report me for advertising-I helped him on his quesion and I think he’ll probably appreciate my answer.</p>

But if you don’t like my ideas for a perfect server, you can always go to someone elses, thats the cool part of moparscape.  You find a server you like and stick with it.  My personal favorite server is <a href="http://samscape.servebeer.com" rel="nofollow noopener">samscape.servebeer.com</a>[/quote]Actually, I like that idea perfectly. Depends on how FAST the leveling is though… maybe 2x, 3x at the max. Mainly I just want the NPC’s to work correctly… plus the actual skills like wood cutting, firemaking, etc.</p>

<p>I just want a source thats close to the real RS. Then I can edit it to make it better. But currently finding sources with mute NPC’s (most sources), the inability to chop trees (easyscape), and not being ab;e to pick your gender doesn’t seem better than the real RS to me…</p>
<p>I’d just rather have a source closer to the Real RS to start with. This isn’t a debate or discussion thread, I was simply asking if such a source existed or not. If not, the sooner i find out, the sooner I can start collecting tutorials, finding which source most have in common, and start making one of my own.</p>

<p>Try WhiteScape or a basic unedited server source, which you can code to your liking.</p>

              <p>Well, I would make mine that way, except there’s this packet for one server, another packet for a completely different server base, etc. Plus, I like it being eidted, but leveling to lvl. 23 in one fight? Come on. I can raise my smithing by fighting a training bag…</p>
<p>Plus NPC’s talking and not getting adamite from them is kinda nice too. And sorry, but not all the players want to be the generic male xP</p>
<p>I was just wondering if anyone else like me has taken a popular server base and moded it then zipped it and have it somewhere.</p>
