    <description>This is a guide on the Windows XP prefetching technique and how it effects your computer and what you can do to speed up your PC as a result of it :D

Prefetch is a new and very useful technique in Windows XP, it helps in the speeding up of certain programs, it works like this:

[b]XP is configured to prefetch program components so that when you load them, it appears to be very quick.[/b]

    * When XP does this the first time, it stores some information about the programs in a file.
    * When XP boots up, it will prefetch portions of the files you use the most. In other words begin running them straight away, so you   have bits of programs running which you may not even need(now see why this sloooows you down? ;))
    * XP loads all associated files, libraries, and pointers necessary to run the program in advance, the preloaded subset makes your system appear quicker but really if your trying to run something like Aryan it is slower!

[b]Now the problem- Prefetch when left alone can also slow down your system. This is because over time:[/b]

XP will retain these portions of a program in the prefetch folder even if you only use it one time, which is not good at all. Since you may not use the program again, you may impact the performance of your system by having portions of a program you do not use loaded in your system&#39;s memory, now imagine having this several times, along with all the programs you use alot.


[b]So, after using XP for some time, the prefetch folder can get full of rarely used or obsolete links which can slow down your computer noticeably... especially when trying to run all your bots. 

What to do?[/b]

Well: [b] Open the folder, mainly located at &#39;C:/windows/prefetch &#39;

Delete ALL  files  (Ctrl+A ---&gt; Del) or atleast anything over about 2 weeks old, remember your PC will re-make the files in due time.
Reboot your PC to allow the changes to take effect.[/b]

 I recommended that you do this every month or so... To often will make programs load slower (no Prefetch files durrrr) and it will just defeat the object of doing this ;) and remember on re-booting if you want certain prefetch files to be &quot;re-gained&quot; just load &#39;em up and your PC will re-create the files for you.


[b][u]Changing Prefetch Settings[/u][/b] *At your own risk*

To change settings for your Prefetch folder you need to go into the registry, one of the most traumatising places on your system.
You can do this with Regedit :)

   [b] Start --&gt; Run --&gt; Type &#39;Regedit&#39; --&gt; OK[/b]

Now that you are in the Registry, you can change the way that Prefetch behaves. This is helpful when you want to alter Prefetch or disable Prefetch completely, I only recommend doing this if your really trying to optimise your PC&#39;s RAM and CPU to the max.
When the Registry Editor Dialog box opens, Try to find to this value:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\PrefetchParameters

In the right hand side of the window, look for the key named EnablePrefetcher. The value of this key represents how Prefetch will operate, it&#39;s a simple as this:
[b]

    0: Disable

    1: Application Launch Prefetch

    2: Boot Prefetch

    3: Prefetch everything
[/b]
Simply type the number in that you want (I reccomend keeping all other settings the same) and click OK. Rebooting the system will give you the new Prefetch setting. Personally I leave this same as I use things like PS and other games which are big programs... but if you have a PC designated for botting then this can be quite helpful. Remember to back-up your registry before doing this, that way you can recover if anything goes wrong.

If you would like a .bat which automatically deletes Prefetch files copy the following 2 lines into notepad and saves as &#39;DelPrefetch.bat&#39;.

del C:\Windows\Prefetch\*.* /Q
pause

When you run the .bat it will automatically delete prefetch files but don&#39;t abuse this file for the reasons above..

EDIT: I have now attatched a pre-made bat file.
EDIT2: It wont let me lol :( keyloggers etc I guess</description>
