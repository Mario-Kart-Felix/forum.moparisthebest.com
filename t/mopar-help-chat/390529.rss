    <title>Mopar help chat!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mopar-help-chat/390529</link>
    <description>I thought I&#39;d take the liberty of making a chatango so that we can all chat in for help with Mopar-Scape and what not. Any and all are aloud in.  This is just a chat to get help with your moparscape server.  I figured a Live Chat would be more helpful.

IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU&#39;RE DOING AND CAN PROVE TO ME THAT YOU DO THEN SPEAK TO ME AND I WILL MAKE YOU A MOD/ADMIN OF THE CHAT!

ANY AND ALL MOPAR STAFFING WILL HAVE ADMINISTRAVITE RIGHTS! ( JUST SPEAK TO ME IF YOU ARE A STAFF AND PROVE TO ME THAT YOU ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE BY LOGGING INTO THAT ACCOUNT AND SENDING ME A MESSAGE THROUGH THE MOPAR WEBSITE )


PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A MOPARSCAPE MADE CHATANGO. THIS WAS MADE BY ME AND DO NOT HOLD ANY PART RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU OR YOUR CLIENTS!  IF YOU ABUSE THE CHAT OR GIVE ANY MISGUIDING INFORMATION YOU WILL BE BANNED FROM THE CHATANGO!

I REQUEST THAT ANY AND/OR ALL SERVER MAKERS JOIN THE CHATANGO SO THAT WE CAN ALL SPEAK IN A MORE FACE TO FACE ENVIRONMENT! 

IF YOU DO KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING PLEASE JOIN! BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED HELP AND HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING THROUGH SIMPLE TUTORIALS. LIKE MYSELF FOR EXAMPLE I CAN&#39;T LEARN WELL WITHOUT A PROPER EXPLANATION!

IF WE END UP GETTING A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THAT CHAT GET&#39;S OUT OF HAND I WILL MAKE ANOTHER AND DIVIDE THE EXPERTS WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING INTO A CERTAIN CHATANGO!

THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT PARTICIPATE!


(NOTE: THIS IS AN ENGLISH CHATANGO! IF YOU DO NOT SPEAK FLUENT ENGLISH PLEASE SEND ME A MESSAGE AND I WILL MAKE A CHATANGO THAT WILL FIT YOUR NEEDS!  )

THE CHATANGO IS: http://moparhelp.chatango.com/</description>
