[SPOILER=Latest Major Updates @ PK-Destiny]

[CODE]Note that this might not be everything, as we might have forgotten some minor things, but here they are folks:
 
- Donators recieve 10 percent Spec back ea kill, Super donators 25 percent, and Extreme donators 50 percent spec back ea kill.
- PK&#39;ing above level 30 rewards you double PKP. However, you may not get double PKP when killing a person on your own IP adress, or repeatedly killing a person which you already killed.
- Bank tabs are now added (Note that you have to right click the tabs and click view in order to view it, as we came across a bug which we havent resolved yet)
- Quest tab is now active. You can see some very interesting Server Information there!
- Donator Shop is now added and priced. Do ::donate ingame to navigate yourself to the Donation Page. (Keep in mind that the Donation Page is just a temporary page, we are working on it)
- Armadyl Crossbow now has a accurate speed
- The PK shops are now priced correctly, to make the eco nice and stable. (Suggestions are available!)
- You can now see the Freeze and veng timers at the side of the client! Do ::commands to see the toggleable commands you can use.
- Dragonfire Shield now has a Operate and special attack system. Have fun!
- Darkbow now works!
- PK Teleports are now added into the game.
- NEW PK TAB! View it by clicking the respective icon in game! (The armour headed guy :P)
- We have now optimized our server start-up to make it more efficient. It has been significantly improved for our own gameplay.
- Saradomin, Guthix and Zamorak cape are now kept on death! You can purchase them by visiting the PVP Shop!
- A few teleports have been added. Please do ::commands ingame to view them.
- Tab to reply has now been added! You no longer have to stress and click on the person you want to message! 
- Donator Points system have now been added!
- Mage Bank can be entered now. The Webs are just a temporary fix! You will have a laugh when you try to cut the webs.
- Antiposion (4) has now been added to the Potion Shop.
- Mystic robe top glitch has now been patched. You no longer see your arm when wearing it.
- Removed useless dead codes.
- Updated Client to its latest version
