    <description>edit: solved, thanks a lot cruel !  :)

im trying to use make a batch file which 
compiles a java file, 
archives the classes into an executable jar, 
then deletes the classes

i can do all of that, except for part of the jar, 
you need to make a text file from which the compiler reads the main class from

iv searched google, but all i get is tutorials on how to make batch files, 

can someone tell me how to create a .txt file and write characters to it

note: the line in the file has to end with a carrage return, can you tell me how to write that in?


while i was searching google, this is the cloest i got

[u]small file writing tut[/u]
1. open command prompt and cd your way to a directory
2. enter &quot;copy con nameoffile.txt
3. type whatever you want to go into the file
4. when you want to end, press control + z
5. the symbol ^Z with come up, enter it

iv tried and this cant be used in batch files</description>
