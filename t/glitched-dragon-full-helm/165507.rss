              <p>i think your problem is an incomplete item.java, the platebodys and helms need to be added into two sections each, platebodys into the “bodys” AND “platebodys” slots othewise they go weird, and the helms need to go into the “hats” and either “fullmask” or “fullhelm” depends on which type of hat it is <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
