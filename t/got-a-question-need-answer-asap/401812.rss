    <description>Well, i didnt know where exactly to put this, so imma put it here. Feel free to lock if it dont belong here.

I&#39;m looking for my old client release. My files were deleted and webhost was shutdown and i completely lost my client and am wondering if ANYONE still has a copy of it by some off-chance. [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,284587.0.html]This is the link to the Client i&#39;m talking about.[/url]

Thanks
