    <title>The Infamous pBeard Glitch...no beards!</title>

    <description>Hello Moparscape forums, 
this is my first post.


I&#39;ve had trouble with this problem in past servers, but have never come across a complete (successfully executed) tutorial that did not worsen my problem.  The gist is, the beards and chin do not exist in my server.  In my private server experience this is a pretty widespread bug, and many seem to have been too inexperienced or lazy to fix the problem, I happen to be one of the former.

I have identified that the problem is at least partially within the Player.java file, specifically related to this snippet of code here in some way (if my tutorial surfing has served me correctly):

[CODE]
//if (!Item.isFullHelm(playerEquipment[playerHat]) &amp;&amp; !Item.isFullMask(playerEquipment[playerHat]) &amp;&amp; (playerLook[0] == 1)) {
		//	playerProps.writeWord(0x100 + pBeard); // Beard without helm
		//} else {
		//	playerProps.writeByte(0);
		//}
		//if (Item.isFullHelm(playerEquipment[playerHat]) &amp;&amp; Item.isFullMask(playerEquipment[playerHat]) &amp;&amp; (playerLook[0] == 1)) {
		//	playerProps.writeWord(0x100 + pBeard); // Beard with helm
		//} else {
		//	playerProps.writeByte(0);
		//} 
[/CODE]

I have hid it with comments in the Player.java file because it actually deletes the entire player, and freezes my client, which I will then have to reboot.  This bit of code was not actually in the server when I downloaded it, I added it from 1 tutorial I found after much searching, and it didn&#39;t seem to help my problem in any way, other than generally identifying which code in what .java file to be adjusted.  

I have also added pBeard as a public int.

[CODE]
public int pBeard;
[/CODE]

Please contact me if you can provide any help or guidance to solving this problem, it would be appreciated.</description>

              <p>Thanks for taking the time to provide a bit of insight, I’ve gotten many “this issue was solved 6 years ago, refer to another post”, however every single “solution” I’ve come across has to do with modifying the pBeard snippets under player.java, which do nothing but create more issues.</p>
<p>To further specify what I’m working with, it’s a tidied up Delta server, so I believe it is very similar to allstar, but the past “fixes” for allstar servers don’t solve my problem.</p>
<p>I’ll attempt to implement this, and edit in an update as soon as I’m stumped or it’s solved.</p>

              <p>I’ve heard of and seen this issue, but never really had to deal with it…</p>
<p>I’d assume it’s an issue with player updating though.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">			if (playerEquipment[playerHat] &gt; 1) {
				playerProps.writeWord(0x200 + playerEquipment[playerHat]);
			} else {
				playerProps.writeByte(0);
			}
// a few lines later....
				if (!Item.isFullHelm(playerEquipment[playerHat])
						&amp;&amp; !Item.isFullMask(playerEquipment[playerHat])) {
					playerProps.writeWord(0x100 + playerAppearance[1]);
				} else {
					playerProps.writeByte(0);
				}</code></pre>
<p>This is what I have for the hat/helm… You don’t need the pBeard variable, that’s probably only contributing to your errors.</p>
<p>Be careful how you add in the code, because the outstream from the server must match the instream of the client, if not, it only causes issues (like invisible players and a world of other things).</p>
