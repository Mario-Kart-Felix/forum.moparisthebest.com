    <description>Well, I saw the South park episode called in the closet a while ago, and I thought it was nonsense. I laughed my balls off. But today I read about the fuss that was caused by the episode, and searched for Xenu on wikipedia. I was astonished. Xenu actually is part of the religion. And spaceships that look like DC-8&#39;s is too. But the fun part is: [size=20pt][b]IT&#39;S WRITTEN BY A [size=30pt][u][i]SCIENCE FICTION[/i][/u] [/size]WRITER![/b][/size]

I mean: I really laughed my ass off again. Goddamn, you must be a fucking idiot to believe this.</description>

It is kept in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy. It is believed by many to be the cloth placed on Jesus of Nazareth at the time of his burial.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Various tests have been performed on the shroud, yet the debates about its origin continue. Radiocarbon dating in 1988 by three independent teams of scientists yielded results published in Nature indicating that the shroud was made during the Middle Ages, approximately 1300 years after Jesus lived.[4] Claims of bias and error in the testing were raised almost immediately, and were answered by Harry E. Gove [5] or others. Yet the dating controversy has continued. Follow-up analysis published in 2005, for example, claimed that the sample dated by the teams was taken from an area of the shroud that was not a part of the original cloth. The shroud was also damaged by a fire in the Late Middle Ages which could have added carbon material to the cloth, resulting in a higher radiocarbon content and a later calculated age. This analysis itself is questioned by skeptics such as Joe Nickell, who reason that the conclusions of the author, Raymond Rogers, result from "starting with the desired conclusion and working backward to the evidence".[6] Former Nature editor Philip Ball has said that the idea that Rogers steered his study to a preconceived conclusion is "unfair" and Rogers "has a history of respectable work".</blockquote>

 The Shroud of Turin or Turin Shroud (Italian: Sindone di Torino, Sacra Sindone [ˈsaːkra ˈsindone] or Santa Sindone) is a length of linen cloth bearing the negative image of a man who is alleged to be Jesus of Nazareth. It is kept in the Chapel of the Holy Shroud, which is located within a complex of buildings which includes the Turin Cathedral, the Royal Palace of Turin, and the Palazzo Chiablese in Turin, Piedmont, northern Italy.

If your not OTIII, xenu does not exist. Scientology will only deny the existence of Xenu. And if you learn about OTIII when it’s not your time, then you will die of a horrible death, unless you pay them money of course. I’m still not dead though, I’ve read the docs.</p>

<p>You are supposed to die of pneumonia if you try to solve OTIII. Hereby I officially declare I am trying to solve OTIII.</p>
<p>But yea, a story that’s ‘calculated to kill’, is the biggest bull I’ve ever heard. So Scientology involves magic too?</p>
<p>I’m wondering, are celebrity’s like Tom Cruise and John Travolta on the giving or the receiving side of the massive money flow.</p>
<p>The fact that you have to pay to get higher in the church just proves it’s a big scam.</p>
<p>Oh and Ske, ThAt0n36Uy isn’t stupid.</p>
<p>Oh and yes, Scientists usually work with dead stuff, chemicals. Or natural laws, which, although the name makes you think otherwise, has nothing to do with biology. If they believe Jesus existed, it means nothing.</p>

<p>You’re an idiot. Trying to bait me? It’s bad enough this debate has gone off topic. But you want to steer it even more off topic.

Why must there be anything else. If you find it illogical, so be it, that’s your eternal soul. I’m not going to sit here and debate with you about why religion is or is not logical.

<p>Scientology is bat shit insane, etc. As for the beliefs of Xenu and stuff, these people are extremely brainwashed. It takes many years and a lot of money to learn about xenu. If your not OTIII, xenu does not exist. Scientology will only deny the existence of Xenu. And if you learn about OTIII when it’s not your time, then you will die of a horrible death, unless you pay them money of course. I’m still not dead though, I’ve read the docs.</p>
<p>The belief of God however isn’t any different to me. Sometimes it’s equally as stupid.</p>

              <blockquote>[b]In a Nutshell
[/b]
    The Church of Scientology is a vicious and dangerous cult that masquerades as a religion. Its purpose is to make money. It practices a variety of mind-control techniques on people lured into its midst to gain control over their money and their lives. Its aim is to take from them every penny that they have and can ever borrow and to also enslave them to further its wicked ends.
<pre><code>It was started in the 1950s by a science fiction writer named L. Ron Hubbard in fulfilment to his declared aim to start a religion to make money. It is an offshoot to a method of psychotherapy he concocted from various sources which he named "Dianetics". Dianetics is a form of regression therapy. It was then further expanded to appear more like a religion in order to enjoy tax benefits. He called it "Scientology".

Scientology is a confused concoction of crackpot, dangerously applied psychotherapy, oversimplified, idiotic and inapplicable rules and ideas and science-fiction drivel that is presented to its members (at the "advanced" levels) as profound spiritual truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>Hubbard claimed to have discovered certain "natural laws" of the spiritual universe, which he claimed can be used to predict and control behavior and phenomena in a manner similar to the way in which the natural laws codified in the physical sciences can be used to predict and control phenomena in the physical world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Further, as one progresses through a series of auditing "levels," one can eventually be restored to native state and can attain the status of  "operating thetan," wherein one is free of attachments to the body and, even while "exterior" to (outside) the body, one can consciously control matter, energy, space, time, thought, and life. Hubbard's writings and lectures include many tantalizing details of the god-like abilities that may be gained through auditing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For most individual Scientologists, recovering these god-like abilities (and encouraging and assisting others to do so as well) is the primary goal of participation in Scientology. The "levels" through which a participant progresses make up what is called "The Bridge to Total Freedom." Progress through all the levels of the "Bridge" often takes many years of dedicated study and practice, and the cost in fees for services for the Bridge is currently estimated at approximately $300,000 - $500,000 in US dollars.</blockquote>

<p>Back on topic. Scientology has, indirectly, killed Jett Travolta. They don’t believe in the use of medicines. But at the same time, they are all about self improvement. But without medicines, your improvement is slowed down drastically, if not halted completely. When you are sick, you can’t think. If you can’t think, you can’t improve mentally.</p>

<p>I could write a bunch of shit about my dog being a giant elephant soul inside him and him being the prophet or something and in 2k years it’ll be true? Cause it was written down?</p>
<p>The thing I have with religion, is:</p>
<p>Either one is true, or none.<br>
And I doubt the god for the one that is true (say christianity) would let all the rest of the world just go to hell because they don’t know about him or were brought up differently in a different culture.</p>
<p>And then if all the religions are true, that means whenever we die we just kinda go wherever we want to believe we go.</p>
<p>Religion is here for two reasons:</p>
<p>Mass population control. Tell everyone they’ll burn for the rest of their lives if they do something wrong, they might listen.<br>
Humans don’t like not understanding things. We have a hard time thinking of infinity and how something can go on forever, never begin or end. We want an answer, and we simplified it to religion.</p>

Do you have any proof your “savior” even existed?</p>

<p>You’re an idiot. Trying to bait me? It’s bad enough this debate has gone off topic. But you want to steer it even more off topic. I don’t have to answer to you, why does religion have to be logical? It’s an act of faith, there’s no factual information to base my decision on, other than my savior’s death. Why must there be anything else. If you find it illogical, so be it, that’s your eternal soul. I’m not going to sit here and debate with you about why religion is or is not logical. I don’t need to, there’s no argument.</p>
<p>If anyone else feels the need to defend religion, feel free to do so. I doubt anyone will. So can this please get back on topic?</p>
