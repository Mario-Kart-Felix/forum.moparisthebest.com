    <title>[PI] A few problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-a-few-problems/463486</link>
    <description>Okay guys I have a few problems with my server:
1. Most of my skills are written wrong.
2. A Custom item I am trying to create needs a LITTLE tweaking.
3. One of my teleportation spells disconnects you from server.
4. Using a smelting object gives the Client some errors and disconnects.
5. One of my Staff Ranks crown isn&#39;t working in speech.

These are just top of my head problems. PM me if you would like to try and help over TeamViewer, or comment only if you&#39;d know how to solve one of these problems. (Except for 3&amp;5 you would HAVE to see it over TV to understand.)

P.S. I am generous with Donating for players helping me.</description>
