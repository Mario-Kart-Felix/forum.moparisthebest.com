    <title>Too Risky? &amp;&amp; walkback</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/too-risky-walkback/102577</link>
    <description>I was wondering if it was risky or too detectable to have your script set to perfectnorth

because i was thinking of using it for my script but if its too detectable then i have to find a way aruond it

and also...does anyone know if there is a tut on making walk and walkback paths from going to and from a bank when you are comign from a place too far away to just detect bank symbol.</description>

<p>And for the walking, make it so if it finds the bank symbol, click it and then start walking from there and if it finds a different landmark, tell it to click it and use a walking procedure.  For landmarks, you can use DTM’s, symbols, maybe unique colors, stuff like that.</p>
