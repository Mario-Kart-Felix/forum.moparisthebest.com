              <p>This uh, isn’t really how we do development teams. We don’t  “mail you” information. Usually you’d want to put pictures and such up to show off your server, and then make an application section for members to apply, or you give them the information to contact you (aka skype). You didn’t supply an e-mail, which makes me question why you said  “mail me” because the only option we technically have besides replying is private messaging.</p>
