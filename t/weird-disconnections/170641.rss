    <title>Weird Disconnections?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weird-disconnections/170641</link>
    <description>Well ok. I have some weird disconnections on my server.

It was running fine a few mins ago, and then I compiled after adding a shop and now my admin acc wont log on. So I made a newbie accound and that logged fine, but then DC&#39;d

There are no errors or anything like that. 

Any help?

Should I take away the NPC I put it?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 03, 2008, 08:27:24 PM[/size][hr]Nevermind! I just had to change the NPC - Must have been a bad NPC</description>
