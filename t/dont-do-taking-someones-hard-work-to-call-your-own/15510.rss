    <description>If you do so, you are taking part in plagiarism.

For those who don&#39;t know what plagiarism means, heres an example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Pla‧gia‧rism - [pley-juh-riz-uhm, -jee-uh-riz-]:the unauthorized use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one&#39;s own original work.&quot; Officially from www.dictionary.com&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You might&#39;ve heard this in your english classes, you might&#39;ve heard it when doing a report, the same applies to the forums:

[center][size=20pt][b]Don&#39;t Do It[/b].[/size][/center]

You may think you have altered it to a certain extent that it becomes yours, but if it was originally someone elses, please notify the community. The act of plagiarism in this forum is also an act of false advertisement ([i]if not verified that you had permission from the author and/or not mentioning the authors name[/i]), which also happens to be a crime in some places. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;False advertising is an act of deliberately misleading a potential client about a product ([i]Claiming the server is yours and/or advertising it in a different name.[/i]), service or a company in general by reporting false or misrepresenting information or data in advertising or other [i]promotional[/i] ([i]Rep[/i]) materials. False advertising is a type of fraud, and may also be considered a hoax.&quot; Officially from www.wikipedia.org&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you want to be accepted by the community, this is definitely not the way to do it.</description>
