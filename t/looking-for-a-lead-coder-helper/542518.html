        <p>To begin with, my name is Perfekt, I’ve been apart of the rsps community for around 4+ years. However, in these 4+ years, I’ve only hosted and coded one server. This server was hosted 3+ years ago and died off fairly quickly due to lack of my time into the server, and some coding problems.<br>
I’m not the best coder, I can say that without a doubt. Hell, I’m not very good at all. I used to be decent, but so much has changed during my time away. However, I really have the hopes of running a RSPS once again. I can host the RSPS without any problems whatsoever, that part is easy, I just need someone to guide me through some things of coding. I’m not asking for someone who will code the whole server from top to bottom, I just need someone who will answer Skype, maybe teamview once in a while to lead me in the right direction as to what I’m trying to accomplish. As I said, I’m not the best coder, so someone who could deal with my stupid questions would be very helpful. I now have multiple friends who can help populate the server, and have agreed to help in doing so.<br>
My future plans with the server include<br>
-A lot of coding<br>
-VPS hosted once things get running, until then I will host.<br>
-Donator system<br>
-Fully run economy<br>
-Advertising on many toplist websites<br>
-Webclient and Webhosted forums.</p>
<p>I really hope somebody can and will help me with this RSPS, or even head me in the right direction when I need a little guidance. I feel the forums take too long to respond, and half the time you don’t even get a reply and the thread dies. Anyways, if anyone is interested, add me on Skype at : gerald.gorritz<br>
or reply to this thread and i will reply as soon as possible!</p>
