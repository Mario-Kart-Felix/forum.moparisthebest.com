<p>I really like it, though I think the time should probably be 5 minutes instead of 15.</p>

No offense, but if you’re actually making money, or have money to spend on your server you shouldn’t be on a free host.

              <p>I think it’s a dumb idea to be honest. All it will do is make it more expensive for the bidders (which I guess is good for mopar). After the last auto extend, it will once again be based on who gets a bid in at the very last second. SAME Problem, more money needed to spend. What REALLY needs to be done is to not allow bidding until the last two days. Make it a Friday and Saturday BEFORE the 10th of the month. Otherwise, people bid early, which does nothing but jack up the prices, and they don’t win anyway. Did anyone SEE the prices for this month? I paid $300 MORE than last month’s first place winner, and got 4th…Of course, this price rise by bidding early is good for mopar as well, so I doubt this will be implemented instead of the auto-extend thing.</p>

              <p>Well for auction sites they don’t have the issue of timing, but i guess you could make it auto-extend for only one minute, with a minimum bid increase, ie something like $20, that way the bidding amount will raise very fast, and maybe set a limit on the auto-extend (ie 15mins which if someone bid at the 59th second of every minute, with only 1 bid a minute which would be the very minimum for it to auto-extend, then after 15minutes it would already have increased the price by $300 minimum with it likely to be a lot more if it hasn’t finished. (This way it won’t go on forever but people new to the server bidding process will understand the amount involved as they will see it increase rather than a last second snipe from 5-10 servers). At the moment it is virtually impossible* to win a slot if you are new to the process and are unaware that in the last second the 10th slot place may very well double its price. (*virtually impossible to win the slot you want, ie if someone is targetting position 10 it is virtually impossible, but if they are aiming for 1 then they obviously would still be likely to make the top 10 if they place a high bid.</p>

</aside>
<p>Sorry, i’m from new zealand so we use a website called trademe.co.nz over here which is based off ebay so i presumed ebay was the same. Basically auto-extend is when the auction is auto-extended by say 2minutes if a bid is placed with less than 2 minutes to go. This removes the luck element and allows bidders to keep bidding without being snaked at the last second.</p>
<p>The thing i found is that bidding went from $150 to $300 (to qualify for sponsorship) within the last 5minutes, and that 9 and 10 (from memory could of been 8 and 10 etc) 11,12,13 all bid within the last minute and 3 of those 5 bid with 1 second to go basically making it a lucky draw. Even anticipating the last second bidding, you still have to guess how much to bid with 1 second to go as It can leap quite a huge amount in the final 10seconds as people place their bid. I even rememember noticing that (i think it was 11 and 10) placed the exact same bid, one placed and 11:59:50 roughly and another at 11:59:59. Unless you want to overguess with a bid that might just sneak you in or a bid that will set you back an extra $100 than you needed it seems to be very much luck. Just my first thoughts after experiencing it first hand. (sorry if i confused you in their, its late over here)</p>

              <p>The one thing i dislike about the sponsorship bid is that it ends at an exact time with no auto extend with a new bid. This means if you want to sneak in to the top ten you have to be very lucky or place a high bid. The month before this one i remember placing a bid which placed me 7th with 20seconds of bidding to go, i ended up at 12th with 2 people placing a bid with exactly 1 second to go lol. If it had an auto-extend by 1minute where the closing time is switched to 1minute if it is currently less than and someone places a bid then it would make it fairer.</p>
