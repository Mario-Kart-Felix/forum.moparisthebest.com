              <p>There’s no such thing as a martial art that sucks dick. Each and every one of them have both strengths and weaknesses.<br>
I suppose you need to look at it from a particular viewpoint: do you want to do a martial art that is just that; an art? Or do you want to do a martial art that has fighting as its focus.</p>
<p>I’m sure that sounds funny, and someone will ask “what martial art doesn’t have fighting as the focus?”. For the record, tae kwon do (which I used to do) was focused on perfection of technique and patterns. A large emphasis was placed on patterns, which make up the artistic side of the sport.<br>
I’m sure it isn’t like this at all tae kwon do dojos, but it was at mine.</p>
<p>You’ll find that muay thai, the one yz85racer mentioned, is quite good if you want an art with a focus on fighting. Unlike tae kwon do (and many others) they don’t limit themselves to just kicking/striking (tae kwon do), or predominately throwing (judo). Muay Thai makes use of 8 body parts for strikes (hands, feet, elbows, knees), something that can be very valuable, and something not found in quite a few arts (where elbow and knee strikes are often illegal sporting-wise; again, I’m speaking from a tae kwon do background when I say that).</p>
<p>Muay Thai is also one of several martial arts taught to police, security guards, military combatants and so on, simply due to the nature of the art (ie, it can easily be used offensively to quickly incapacitate someone).</p>

Boxing teaches you terrible habits, the biggest one I can remember is NEVER put weight on your front foot when throwing a punch. This leaves you vulnerable to a inside kick which would probably put you on the ground. It also teaches you to keep your feet way to wide apart, and lean into the punches. Big no, this leaves you vulnerable to a Judo throw, which if done right can end the fight instantly.</p>
<p>Martial Arts is not for pussies, I don’t see how it is - please elaborate.</p>
<p>I am sure if I was to go up against you (a boxer) I would most probably win, due to a Muay Thai fighters stance. That is the only dividend between the two fighting styles (I say fighting styles as boxing is not a Martial Art). Whilst most Martial Arts are jokes, e.g Karate, a few of them are extremely vicious and a lot faster than boxing.</p>

Yes I have experience in Martial Arts. I do Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Join a martial art which doesn’t suck dick.</p>
<p>I’m currently struggling in BJJ with the Peruvian Neck-tie choke, don’t know why but I always end up doing something wrong, I’ve been meaning to ask my instructor but keep forgetting l0l<br>
[/quote]Did you say Tang Soo Do sucks dick, I’m just wondering.</p>
<p>Jiu-Jitsu? I’m impressed, never knew you did that[/quote]<br>
