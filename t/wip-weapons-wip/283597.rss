    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wip-weapons-wip/283597</link>
    <description>[size=10pt][u]RULES[/u]
1.) There will be no spamming
2.) No yelling or fighting.(Includes Cursing)
3.) No telling people there work sucks this is a constructive thread.
4.)This is not a help thread so dont ask how to do something this is just to show your future work.
5.) Lastly no advertising please I don&#39;t want your links to your models that would technically make them done so please dont post a download link of any sort.


[u]How to Post:[/u]
1.) RENDER YOUR WORK.
2.)Make it a IMAGE CODE not a link

I will try to keep the thread as active as possible please help me to do so with your work I would love to see it! Hopefully this thread will go far in showing off work that is not completely finished and will keep from making the Models thread so long. :D

              <p>This is true but why the trouble and that will just be another post on its way to the back. This way people can see your work as long as this stays near the top and things like that Im sorry if yall dont think this is a good idea… Mods can remove if they see fit just thought it would help some people</p>
