    <title>Elderly Gay Couple Forcibly Separated, Abused, Robbed By County Officials in Cal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/elderly-gay-couple-forcibly-separated-abused-robbed-by-county-officials-in-cal/337385</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Clay and his partner of 20 years, Harold, lived in California. Clay and Harold made diligent efforts to protect their legal rights, and had their legal paperwork in place—wills, powers of attorney, and medical directives, all naming each other. Harold was 88 years old and in frail medical condition, but still living at home with Clay, 77, who was in good health.

....

What happened next is even more chilling: without authority, without determining the value of Clay and Harold’s possessions accumulated over the course of their 20 years together or making any effort to determine which items belonged to whom, the county took everything Harold and Clay owned and auctioned off all of their belongings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>It sounds very much like only one side of the story.  It still doesn’t sound right, but there is certainly more information not shared on that site.</p>
