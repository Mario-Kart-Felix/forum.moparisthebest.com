    <description>ok so i vain i has been helping me and im sure i am close but i have been fiddleing with the code for an hour now and still cant get it

please someone tell me what i am doing wrong? what i am trying to do is add a 1 hour timer to this command
[code=java]if (playerCommand.equals(&quot;vote&quot;)) {
            long commandDelay = 3600000; //1 hour
            // loop for stupid stuff
            if (System.currentTimeMillis() - commandDelay &lt; 3600000 ) {
               for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++)
                                        if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
                                                Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
                                                c2.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?action=up&amp;server=tainted-pkz.no-ip.org&quot;, 12000); //actions to do
                        commandDelay = System.currentTimeMillis();
                        c.sendMessage(&quot;You receive 10 pk points and 10m for voting you can do this once every hour.&quot;);
                                                c.pkPoints += 10;
                                                c.getItems().addItem(995, 10000000);
                                        }
                            }
            }[/code]

when compile it gives no errors but when using the command in-game it linkis you to the vote site but does not give the items/pkpoints/send the message and you can still use it over and over as many times as you want


please if someone can spoonfeed my dumbass i would love you *no homo*
and if you where to spoon feed me i promise i will be learning not just leeching a spoon-fed code
and that is what i am here for is to learn so i can come here and help ppl insted of needing the help myself
so PLEASE someone atleast tell me what i am doing wrong
vain said i needed to put the timer in the loop and that i had the loop in the timer? idk what to do tho so please i beg :(</description>
