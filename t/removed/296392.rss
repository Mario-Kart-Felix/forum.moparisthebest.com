<p>= Attitude.</p>
<p>Trollmuch doesn’t have complete control over what his users does - It’s not his fault. Newty wouldn’t have gotten attitude back from Trollmuch if Newty simply asked him to tell his players not to do it anymore, but instead he threatened him. AGAIN, Newty needs to learn how to cool it with his superinternetmodpowers, and just talk to the guy - You’ll get much further that way.</p>

Which is most likely why he only got a warning? Thats why the guy told him if it happens again then he will have to take action.<br>

<p>Trollmuch didn’t like newty’s attitude, which is why Trollmuch responded the way he did. It all goes back to newty’s ego argument, he needs to learn to cool it.[/quote]<br>
Read the last 2 pages of this thread, where the fuck is the attitude? If a server thats being advertised is causing issues throughout the forum, the best way to handle it is get rid of the server from this forum. Thats what newty said would happen if the spam didnt stop.</p>

<p>Since you don’t need this site for advertising you wouldn’t mind this thread being locked and wiped then? As well as your server name added to the censor list? Post back here if you still don’t care.</p>

What the fuck are you talking about, I have NEVER tried to bring up any server even CLOSE to kingpk, seeing as the server is just known for autocatching\casting and you know it lol. You got me confused with someone else, which doesn’t surprise me because everyone knows your not the brightest of the bunch.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>and for your sake the post was removed.[/quote]<br>
As I said why would I even try to bring back a server that is known for being ausbot heaven? Your just a complete idiot and don’t remember who actually made the post, because it wasn’t me. Get it through your head.</p>
