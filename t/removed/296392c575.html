<p>Speaking of immature, LOL.</p>
<p>That dedicated he has is hosted at Staminus buddy boy. Whois king-pk before you open your mouth.<br>
The starting price at Staminus is $169 per month, however he has already stated that his dedicated is more than $400 and has taken in about $169. Either way kiddo, he has not made a profit.</p>
<p>It is not in your place to doubt if he’s lying about his donations or not. Matter of fact this has nothing to do with you either. Twice you’ve proven yourself to be a hypocrite.</p>
<p>Now an immature 13 year old? COME ON NOW MEW. Who’s the one who kept hitting my site offline? Who’s the one who’s already coming off as a hypocrite on his first argument post? Who’s the one who tells his 5 players to go advertise where they have no business advertising? Mew sir, your argument has a bunch of holes in it.</p>
<p>Age has nothing, NOTHING to do with sticking up for a friend. In fact it’s completely irrelevant. However, you still are completely wrong about my age. Even more, how can you even guess my age by what I do over the INTERNET? It’s a proven fact that people act differently over the internet. So again, a hole in your argument.</p>
<p>I’m 19 by the way, got a birthday coming up November 2nd. Since I highly doubt you can count past 10, I’ll be 20 on that date.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Where do you see me trying to guess your actual age? I compared you to a 13 year old by your constant childish behaviour repeating through several forums. I’ll tell you one thing though, its horrifying to know that you are actually 19 and behave like this. Next time try to read properly before you even think about responding to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“That dedicated he has is hosted at Staminus buddy boy. Whois king-pk before you open your mouth.” Excuse me? Did I deny or state that it is not hosted at Staminus? I was simply referring to his dedicated server specs seeing as you seemed so sure of yourself in your previous post, clearly you have no idea what you are talking about.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The starting price at Staminus is $169? Mind checking that again before you come here and shout the odds out. His protection costs around $400(+) + his dedi fee, and for the record please do ask him if he paid for any of it out of his own pocket. Furthermore I was the first to go with Staminus so I would know this better than you or him.</p>
<p>I have more than enough reasons to doubt him as he has proved several times in the past that he is not worthy of running a server; he cannot program, little knowledge on mysql, very basic all round knowledge on running a server. Even his own in real life friend exposed him on what he was doing with his donations. The truth is, I don’t really care what he does.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Hypocrite? - “FUSIONPK HAS A BOTNET!11” - You have no right to talk to anyone about being a hypocrite.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you must know, I attacked your site because you was messaging Tewl and telling him that we have 40 players online so he could DDoS us. I hope you realise that you are the one that started it and the end result was that you achieved nothing. <a href="http://google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a> &amp; FusionPK is still up, whereas you are nowhere on the map.</p>
<p>Now I won’t continue to argue with you because someone like you won’t give up even if you are proved wrong in every possible way. Quite frankly I am not online on these forums enough to keep up with someone like you because I am pretty certain that you will have a reply for me in less than 15 minutes.</p>

<p>So what was that statement about? Where you said I’m “no where on the map”? You implied that you were actually getting some where. Come on now Mew, help me out. Rofl.<br>
The only problems RSCPK was having were HTTP attacks (you), and they were hardly a problem. Nothing that Tewl did effected the server, we were protected and he knew that, hence he stopped and you came along with your petty attacks. Assumptions dude, chill with them.</p>

<p>I have 230 worth of protection. ( its a deal they cut @ the 2gps protection) Hence why my server is CONSTANT attacks and hasnt gone down. Only a FEW lag spikes when its attacked. Dedi cost and my server dedi cost it self is 179 a month. With a discount and add ons for the core 2 2.4 package…although my server specs and what i pay is irrelevant from this topic. Keep your spam somewhere else “!mew” whoever fuck that is…</p>
<p>What i do with donations and what my server makes etc is also irrelevant to this topic. Just know i am still in “debt” in ways i still haven’t made BACK the money i put INTO kingpk in donations…</p>
<p>This topic is here to ADVERTISE.</p>
<p>Everything Jesse has stated is true, No need for this “!mew” person to start random bullshit because he is mad his server overall online population cant even obtain the amount of players i have pking in the wild…</p>

<p>Like I told you before, no-one cares. I run the server for fun, why do you assume that I am trying to get “anywhere” by running a Runescape private server, you take it too seriously. Don’t lie, you shut your server down because you got DDoSed everyday by Tewl, oh and because you couldn’t afford it of course.</p>
<p>I don’t need to lie about anything so telling me that I proved your “point” about attacking you is worthless, as I am sure no-one cares, I have never denied it. What you done was just cowardly, running to Tewl like to say he was your God. No-one cares about you or Tewl, full stop. You got DDoSed because you got my server DDoSed, SIMPLE AS.</p>
<p>Dropped a “huge” bomb on myself, your pathetic yet amusing.</p>
<p>W/E</p>
<p>You talk way to much, crap that is.</p>
<p>-Mew[/quote]</p>
<p>Holy shit get over yourself. No one cares about you, your shit server, and your botnet. Tewl attacked you because you’re an annoying cunt who can’t ever shut the fuck up for the life of it.</p>
<p>I’ll be like you and sign everything like an idiot who trys to look official on a runescape forum:</p>

<ol>
<li>Where do you see me trying to guess your actual age? I compared you to a 13 year old by your constant childish behaviour repeating through several forums. I’ll tell you one thing though, its horrifying to know that you are actually 19 and behave like this. Next time try to read properly before you even think about responding to me.[/quote]</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s all the same thing. You’re implying that I’m 13 by saying I’m immature. And also, like I said, it’s very dumb of you to judge me by my actions over the internet.</p>
<p>[quote author=!Mew link=topic=392415.msg2960260#msg2960260 date=1253141121]<br>
2)Excuse me? Did I deny or state that it is not hosted at Staminus? I was simply referring to his dedicated server specs seeing as you seemed so sure of yourself in your previous post, clearly you have no idea what you are talking about.[/quote]</p>
<p>Go look on the site if you’re unsure about the dedicated server specs, and honestly it doesn’t matter. I proved my point.</p>
<p>[quote author=!Mew link=topic=392415.msg2960260#msg2960260 date=1253141121]<br>
The starting price at Staminus is $169? Mind checking that again before you come here and shout the odds out. His protection costs around $400(+) + his dedi fee, and for the record please do ask him if he paid for any of it out of his own pocket. Furthermore I was the first to go with Staminus so I would know this better than you or him.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s very much irrelevant if you’ve been there first. How stupid are you?<br>
Again, his donation intake is much lower than how much his protection + dedicated server actually is. Why is your actually argument?</p>
<p>[quote author=!Mew link=topic=392415.msg2960260#msg2960260 date=1253141121]<br>
I have more than enough reasons to doubt him as he has proved several times in the past that he is not worthy of running a server; he cannot program, little knowledge on mysql, very basic all round knowledge on running a server. Even his own in real life friend exposed him on what he was doing with his donations. The truth is, I don’t really care what he does.[/quote]</p>
<p>Right there, you just dropped a huge bomb on yourself. I’ll let you correct (maybe even contradict) yourself. I wont say any more about it.</p>
<p>[quote author=!Mew link=topic=392415.msg2960260#msg2960260 date=1253141121]<br>
4) Hypocrite? - “FUSIONPK HAS A BOTNET!11” - You have no right to talk to anyone about being a hypocrite.[/quote]</p>
<p>When have I ever been immature about the matter? I said my facts, got people to believe it and it’s simple as that. I’m not the hypocrite here, and honestly that was a very sad attempt to twist it around.</p>
<p>[quote author=!Mew link=topic=392415.msg2960260#msg2960260 date=1253141121]<br>
If you must know, I attacked your site because you was messaging Tewl and telling him that we have 40 players online so he could DDoS us.[/quote]</p>
<p>I reminded Tewl and Fusion. That’s it. I never said to attack Fusion. However, thanks for proving my point about you attacking my site.</p>
<p>[quote author=!Mew link=topic=392415.msg2960260#msg2960260 date=1253141121]<br>
I hope you realise that you are the one that started it and the end result was that you achieved nothing. <a href="http://google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a> &amp; FusionPK is still up, whereas you are nowhere on the map.[/quote]</p>
<p>No sir, I believe it you started it on Ausbot, along with those other jackasses. Good, I’m glad I shut RSCPK down. But tell me, where do you think you’re getting running a little RSC server? A dead one at that? Honestly you cannot support your arguments for the life of you.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>Now I won’t continue to argue with you because someone like you won’t give up even if you are proved wrong in every possible way. Quite frankly I am not online on these forums enough to keep up with someone like you because I am pretty certain that you will have a reply for me in less than 15 minutes.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yet I’ve yet to be proved wrong. You’re just like every typical kid on this forum. You don’t see both sides of the argument, you think just because you said something (stupid in fact) that you’ve won the argument. You’ve already diminished yourself.</p>
<p>So honestly, get out. Don’t come back. However if I’m correct, you will be back just like everyone else who says they’re leaving. The only reason why you’re dropping this argument is because you cannot defend yourself worth a damn.</p>
