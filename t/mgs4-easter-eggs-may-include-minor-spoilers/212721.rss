    <title>MGS4 - Easter eggs *May include minor spoilers*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mgs4-easter-eggs-may-include-minor-spoilers/212721</link>
    <description>Well as i completed the game the first time around you don&#39;t notice much but the second time around you specifically look for little things.

Some of you may already know, but in the cutscenes you can use the Mk. ll (Metal Gear) to go around the plane where the mission cutscenes are, you can go pretty much anywhere in the plane while the cutscene is still going on, you can have it split screen (quarter of its the mk. ll, half the actual cutscene) but you can change this to full screen, one thing i did not try the first time around is going up these stairs to sunnys kitchen to see her cooking her eggs (lulz) and i noticed her get a psp out of the box and start playing on it.

Sorry for the bad quality:

which i just noticed is fucking huge.

I&#39;ll add some more when i find them.</description>

              <p>There is plenty more, just it takes some time to get to them places, what i find amazing is that the game seems to carry on doing other stuff around you.
