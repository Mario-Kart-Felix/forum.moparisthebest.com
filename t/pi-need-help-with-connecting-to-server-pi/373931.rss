    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-help-with-connecting-to-server-pi/373931</link>
    <description>Okay, my server base is PI
when ever i try to connect to my server from my computer, it works fine.
when i go on another one of my computers to connect, it always says error connecting to server.
I start up uTorrent, then No-Ip, then run my server to get it online.
The port check tool that comes with No-Ip dosent show any errors.
I am with Sky broadband, and every computer is connected wireless.
My firewall is zone alarm, but under Firewall &gt; Zones, I have added the correct host information.

Please Help :cool:</description>

<p>In the server class, you should find an ip like “0.0.0.0”, “127.0.0.1” or some miscellaneous ip.</p>
