    <title>Logarithms (and maybe some Algorithms)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/logarithms-and-maybe-some-algorithms/369226</link>
    <description>This week in my Discrete Structures module we&#39;ve been doing Matrice&#39;s, Logs, and Algorithm. I really really can&#39;t seem to get the hang of Logs or Algorithms at all, and was hoping someone would be able to provide me with some methods for working them out as I have a test tomorrow (I&#39;m not using your answers for a worksheet).

I can do very basic logs e.g 
log[sub]2[/sub](16) = 4
log[sub]4[/sub](2x32) = 3

but where I&#39;m really struggling is for logs with fractions and other functions in. for example:
log[sub]121[/sub](11)
log[sub]2[/sub](1/8)
log[sub]4[/sub](1/2)
4[sup]log[sub]2[/sub][/sup][sup](3)[/sup]

Any methods for working out any of the above and I would be so so grateful. 

Likewise, an example question for this test is:
How many steps would a binary search take on a sorted list of 1000? 

A student is given a list of six projects to choose from and has to list them in descending order of preference. How many possibilities are there for such a list? 

With Algorithms I&#39;m really just looking for any sort of explaination as to what they are/how they work, but I probably wont even attempt the Qs on the test. 

Really bad at maths. 

Thanks to anyone that helps.</description>

6! = 720 is the correct one, since you can’t choose the same project more than once.</p>

n!, where n is number of project.<br>
Why: First the student have 6 projects to choose from, for the second on the list he have 5 projects…</p>
<p>“log121(11)”<br>
You know how log works right?<br>
For what power of 121 gives you 11? That will be 1/2, since (x^1/2) = sqrt(x)<br>
log2(1/8)<br>
For this. 2^-3 = 1/2^3 = 1/8<br>
For that reason log2(1/8) is -3.</p>
<p>Hope you understand a little…</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>This week in my Discrete Structures module we’ve been doing Matrice’s, Logs, and Algorithm. I really really can’t seem to get the hang of Logs or Algorithms at all, and was hoping someone would be able to provide me with some methods for working them out as I have a test tomorrow (I’m not using your answers for a worksheet).</p>
<p>I can do very basic logs e.g<br>
log[sub]2<a>/sub</a> = 4<br>
log[sub]4<a>/sub</a> = 3</p>
<p>but where I’m really struggling is for logs with fractions and other functions in. for example:<br>
log[sub]121<a>/sub</a><br>
log[sub]2<a>/sub</a><br>
log[sub]4<a>/sub</a><br>
4[sup]log[sub]2[/sub][/sup]<a>sup</a>[/sup]</p>
<p>Any methods for working out any of the above and I would be so so grateful.</p>
<p>Likewise, an example question for this test is:<br>
How many steps would a binary search take on a sorted list of 1000?</p>
<p>A student is given a list of six projects to choose from and has to list them in descending order of preference. How many possibilities are there for such a list?</p>
<p>With Algorithms I’m really just looking for any sort of explaination as to what they are/how they work, but I probably wont even attempt the Qs on the test.</p>
<p>Really bad at maths.</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone that helps.</p>
