<p>Why are you saying RSCR has 10 online? It’s being attacked with 19-23 Gbps daily, yet it still peaked at 34 online today and almost always has 15-25 players online between attacks.</p>

<p>To be fair we dont try to cut it. All we do is bring to people what  they enjoy. The revenue it give or the amount of players we got is only a number. What we care bout is to wake up in the morning and work on this project as we love to do this.</p>
<p>As for the DDOS well… its kind of obvious someone hate all the hard dedication we put into this and that we been able to accomplish all this in a few months while others took years to be half as advanced.</p>
<p>But i understand your point . Its lot of time and dedication for such a small community. Reason we are doing it is because we love this game and this project .</p>
<p>Overall, kind of happy you gave a try. RSC players deserve our effort to bring them what they enjoy playing.</p>
<p>Kudos for at least trying!</p>
<p>Hows your school session by the way?</p>

              <p>Community driven. Community is dead. I have no problem working on it but I am right around the corner of finishing my degree. There just isn’t any demand for it. Look at RSCR (as soon as I personally launched moparclassic they went out of their way to launch their server) with 10 players online. Same thing with ProjectRSC where we announce moparclassic… kryptix dies and people think they can be head man of the community because that opportunity is available. ProjectRSC is now dead.</p>
<p>You can sit here and bash on moparclassic and that’s easy to do but once again it all comes back to being a community driven server. If people want to get together and coordinate this project they are more than welcome to… but it’s the same reasoning that they won’t which is why it’s not publicly hosted.</p>
<p>MoparClassic has been in development for 8 years now. It’s just an updated RSCD and we gave credits when credit was due to everyone who pitched in along the way. The reason we changed the name is because instead of battling it out, ddosing each other, driving away the players it’s time to say fk it and centralize the community with the open source project.</p>
<p>You have 2 people who are more than happy to pay the cost of hosting (MITB and I). I did host the project recently which was great because it gave us a hand full of problems I would of never of been able to test alone and it looks like we fixed a few dupes that were there previously. I threw down the towel since MITB wanted the server to be more centralized and I felt that it was necessary since he obviously meets the requirements and has great success with his projects. Plus he’s not money hungry which eliminates 99% of you guys.</p>
<p>Anyways… say what you want. Bash the server, state the “facts” but in all reality you have 2 solutions… a server that has been economically fked for the past few years and was ran by a money hungry pirate or a server with 10 people online that’s doing it’s best to be closed source and compete. Tbh I would pick a pk server with 100x exp rate and play that for a week before joining either of those.</p>

MoparClassic has been in the making for past 3 years, and is still not being hosted anywhere, nor any notable development progress has been done since start (other than rewriting tons of things in scala and other bullshit who nobody asked for and has no effect in game). Don’t bother wasting time on this, everyone else gave up on it already.</p>

<p>How can I contribute? If it’s money, I have too many bills right now to dish out even 1 dollar.</p>
<p>I think moparisthebest said he/she is waiting on the client. Don’t think I can do much there. That might be on you guys, the developers.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/n0om">@n0om</a>, I may consider it. How many people actively play your server?</p>

Don’t give up just yet, your prayers has been answered<br>
Take a look at <a href="http://www.rscrevolution.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">RSCRevolution</a>, it’s been online for 3 months and has F2P replicated, partly replicated P2P(Skills, NPC’s, Drops, 8 quests) and is still being actively developed.</p>
