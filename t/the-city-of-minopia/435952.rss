    <title>The City of Minopia</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-city-of-minopia/435952</link>
    <description>[b]Greetings, Adventurer[/b]

Welcome to the City of Minopia. A once thriving community that has become a shadow of its former self. The content individuals who once called themselves residents of the land have either fleed the once proud city or have been slaughtered in their own homes. The constant invasion of monsters beyond your wildest imaginations has driven the city into an empty shell of what it once was. Streets once bustling with activity are now dark and deserted. Magnificent houses have been torn down in haste as residence have tried to flee the danger that lies beneath, however, only some succeeded.

The royalty of the city tried everything to save the community, but all attempts failed until only one lone soldier remained. He has tirelessly worked night and day, week after week on constructing what in hopes will rebuild the once proud land and return peace and prosperity to Minopia.

This is where you come in. A giant structure which can only be described as an arena of the undead has been built and the lone solider calls to you, adventurer, to aid in the battle to save the beautiful land that he calls home.

You will be pitted against three waves of mobs, each increasing in difficulty one after the other. Monsters will rise from the depths and you will fight your way through the waves in an attempt to reach eternal glory. This will be no easy task, so bring your best armor, swords, bows and potions with you and you may just have a slim chance of victory. This will test your skills as a marksman, a swordsman and how efficiently you can use your surroundings with only what you bring. Be warned, once you enter the pit, there is no return until you succeed, or die.

If by some miracle you are able to defeat the challenge then you will be rewarded with gifts beyond your wildest dreams. You will be given access to a dungeon with:


[ul][li]A total of three experience farms. Two cave spiders and one zombie. All specifically built to give you the best and most effective enchantments for your weapons and armor.[/li]
[li]Three seperate underground tree farms. All filled to the brim with Oak, Birch and Dark Wood trees.[/li]
[li]Four fully automatic farms for all your Watermelon, Wheat, Pumpkin and Sugarcane needs.[/li]
[li]A railway to neighboring towns.[/li]
[li]A Nether portal which arrives to a fully stocked Netherwart farm and a pathway to a nearby Nether Fortress with a Blaze Spawner.[/li]
[li]The rest will be revealed upon opening[/li][/ul]


Not only will you be rewarded with full access to this dungeon but you will also be given a chance to build your very own house in Minopia. This will be governed by a set of rules however and you must prove your creativity to be eligible for a place in the town.

Current Residents of Minopia:

[i]Note: This is not yet open to the public and much of this is yet to be built before the challenge may be completed and the rewards to be given. However I can expect a full release within the next two - three weeks.[/i]

The main reason for this thread is I need to know how many players will wish to build a home in Minopia, whether it will be permanent residence or just a spare house. If you believe you wish to take on the challenge, please post below so I can roughly estimate the size of land I need to clear for houses to be built.

Goodluck Adventurer, you will need it.</description>
