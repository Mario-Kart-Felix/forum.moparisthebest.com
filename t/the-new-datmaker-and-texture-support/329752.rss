    <title>The new datmaker and texture support</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-new-datmaker-and-texture-support/329752</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

I&#39;m Edvinas from R-S (sorry if I&#39;m not allowed to post the name of forum here, tell me and I&#39;ll remove).
I love how this community is contributing towards the client related stuff such as modeling, unlike R-S where people only want to make &quot;100% runescape&quot; or &quot;old runescape&quot; lol.

Anyways, I&#39;ve heard that MrpotatoeHead is making a new datmaker, and that he will add support for model textures?

The question is generally towards MrpotatoeHead, so I suggest you don&#39;t start spamming unless you know the answer as well ^^

How is it going with the datmaker, well more of how is it going with the texture support? Any teasers on when we could expect you to release a beta?

I&#39;m really looking forward to it. RSPS modeling would get a whole new meaning, and would give me and other modelers lots to do replacing runescape&#39;s crappy models with good-looking textured ones.

Thanks

EDIT:
lol why do you filter R-S? They don&#39;t filter moparscape.. :D</description>

And as far as I know, it’s going well, don’t think he’s had any problems that haven’t been already overcome yet.</p>
