    <title>~~ Coders Read please ~~ (508)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/coders-read-please-508/267017</link>
    <description>okay i have been coding my new 508 server for about a week now and i have this problem and i have worked on it for around 2 days now. The Problem is that I&#39;m trying to make a meat tenderizer have the special attack, animation, gfx, and stance of a gmaul. and its very frustrating, i have looked at all of the 508 tutorials on the moparscape forum, and even tried to look into other server files to see if i could find my mistake. But no matter how hard i try, i can&#39;t get it to work at all... When i originally started to work on the meat tenderizer, it didn&#39;t even work like a weapon, and you couldnt even wield it. But i have managed to make it a wield able weapon, and it still looks like my player is trying to hold a sword.   :(

So if anyone can help me with this i would appreciate it... thanks.</description>
