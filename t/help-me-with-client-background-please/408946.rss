    <description>Ok so orignally the folder called BrokenXcache2 was seperated with the client and source, so i added the folder to the client folder. In that folder, BrokenXcache2, it has the sprites and i replaced the background.png sprite with my own, and tried compiling but nothing happened.. What else could i try? (Pics below show all the files and what i did.)

              <p>First of all you don’t compile caches… and make sure you make it like this save it into the sprites folder “Background.png” exactly like that I prefer to copy and paste that without the quotes.</p>
