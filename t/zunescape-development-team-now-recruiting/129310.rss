[b]As the people who signed up know, ZuneScape has been cancelled. But I have changed my mind. While stumbling across a source called Backtolumby EX, I decided that I will use that as the base. Unfortunatly someone screwed up our forums. So I am not only hiring Server Coders. But now I am hiring Web Designers too. If you are interested, please use the forum listed below in &quot;Code:&quot;[/b]
