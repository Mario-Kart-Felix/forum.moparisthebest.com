    <description>Greetings fellow Hamachi possessors. I am looking for somebody to try to get on my server using Hamachi because all of my friends are too &quot;busy&quot;. I understand that Hamachi is stupid and inconvenient, but due to the fact that my ISP doesn&#39;t allow me to port forward correctly because it is stupid, and that I need to save up still for a VPS, I am stuck with Hamachi. I will only be using it to allow my staff and I to work on the server together. So if anybody is willing to help me out, please pm me and I will give you the download link to my server, and my Hamachi IP and password. I am not giving out this information in the thread because that would be considered advertising. Thank you.</description>

<p>Do you know this for sure? If so, why not try to contact them and see if they can allow it.</p>
