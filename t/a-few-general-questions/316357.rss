<li>Right click the folder and go open with -&gt; Notepad</li>
<li>A compiler saves/sets the new changes you have made to client.java etc…</li>
<li>Your mate nor your client is lagging, Its your computer that isnt good enough to host it, You computer must be a little old or you are using a project-Ceaser (however you spell it) based source (which can be also lagging him).[/quote]<br>
It’s not just his computer that can’t handle the server. It could also be his internet connection you know <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">

              <p>1: Notepad to edit CFG files.<br>
2: A compiler converts Java source code into Java bytecode which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine.<br>
3: Same as the guy above.</p>
