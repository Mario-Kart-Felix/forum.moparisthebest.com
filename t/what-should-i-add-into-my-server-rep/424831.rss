First of all, I don’t want rep (but its nice you said).<br>
A server must have its own uniqueness, otherwise it’s considered “just like everyone else.”<br>
I was thinking when making my own server that I could make a phone, that would replace the friends list, or teleport me around, and etc.<br>
You could make other things, such as a place, like a labratory that has monsters hiding and they come out of nowhere and attack the player. It’s difficulty could be rated HARD.<br>
Just use your imagination and put determination and you will make the best of servers.<br>

good idea but ill need a model person to make the phone model[/quote]<br>
Make the model from a tutorial, basicully you just need 4 lines and fill it in with black or so.</p>
