    <title>Theory: Two types of Item Collections #317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/theory-two-types-of-item-collections-317/540700</link>
    <description>Item collections were usually something I struggled as an RSPS developer to try and determine a best route of action for properly emulating. Well, after a bit of thought I think I have come up with a solution and a differing viewpoint on the frames sent to the client to synchronize the item collections.

There are two frames for setting items on a widget, one sets specific slots in the widget items array, another iterates from the start of the items array to a &#39;count&#39; variable.

[code=java]
if (opcode == 53) {
    redrawTab = true;
    int widgetId = inBuffer.read16u();
    Widget widget = Widget.cache[widgetId];
    int itemCount = inBuffer.read16u();
    for (int i_ = 0; i_ &lt; itemCount; i_++) {
        widget.items[i_] = inBuffer.read16u();
        int stackSize = inBuffer.read8u();
        if (stackSize == 255) {
            stackSize = inBuffer.read32();
        }
        widget.itemAmounts[i_] = stackSize;
    }
    for (int i_ = itemCount; i_ &lt; widget.items.length; i_++) {
        widget.items[i_] = 0;
        widget.itemAmounts[i_] = 0;
    }
    opcode = -1;
    return true;
}

if (opcode == 34) {
    redrawTab = true;
    int widgetId = inBuffer.read16u();
    Widget widget = Widget.cache[widgetId];
    while (inBuffer.offset &lt; packetSize) {
        int itemSlot = inBuffer.readUSmart();
        int itemId = inBuffer.read16u();
        int itemAmount = inBuffer.read8u();
        if (itemAmount == 255) {
            itemAmount = inBuffer.read32();
        }
        if (itemSlot &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; itemSlot &lt; widget.items.length) {
            widget.items[itemSlot] = itemId;
            widget.itemAmounts[itemSlot] = itemAmount;
        }
    }
    opcode = -1;
    return true;
}
                   
[/code]

The previous function of these two frames was to use one to initialize a list, and one to update slots in a list. The frames can work for that function but I thought &quot;Well this doesn&#39;t really fit, seems a bit more complicated than it should be.&quot;

So I thought, well what if the two frames were used for sending specific collection [i]types[/i]? Packet 53 would make sense to be sent for the bank item container since a bank cannot have any null elements and new elements are appended to the end of the collection. Packet 34 would make sense to be sent for the backpack (inventory) since the inventory can contain null elements and those elements dont have to be ordered since players have the ability to move items around on the inventory.

TL;DR

I believe packet 53 is for decoding the structure of a linked list while packet 34 is for decoding the structure of an array list.

<p>I’m referring to after that time. I think it was a technology update where they added in the other frame.</p>

<p>I can’t recall seeing a picture of a bank where there was an empty space. There COULD be, but I think by predefined behavior of a widget you cannot do this without hacks. If you could find a picture that’d be great.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>When bank items are removed, items are shifted to cover the blank space. When bank items are added, items are appended to the end of the container. This is what I based my ideas off of. I’m trying to think of a case where there could be an empty slot.[/quote]That used to be the case, they allowed empty slots in an update quite a while ago. Note that this was just temporary for organization and it would collapse once you closed the bank again. However in the case of the widgets then yes it did allow empty space. It depends on the revision though, if this is just based on like 300’s revisions then Im sure you’re right.</p>

<p>The previous function of these two frames was to use one to initialize a list, and one to update slots in a list. The frames can work for that function but I thought “Well this doesn’t really fit, seems a bit more complicated than it should be.”</p>
<p>So I thought, well what if the two frames were used for sending specific collection <span class="bbcode-i">types</span>? Packet 53 would make sense to be sent for the bank item container since a bank cannot have any null elements and new elements are appended to the end of the collection. Packet 34 would make sense to be sent for the backpack (inventory) since the inventory can contain null elements and those elements dont have to be ordered since players have the ability to move items around on the inventory.</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>I believe packet 53 is for decoding the structure of a linked list while packet 34 is for decoding the structure of an array list.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
