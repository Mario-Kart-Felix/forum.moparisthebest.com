    <title>[474] Need Some Shop Help [474]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/474-need-some-shop-help-474/469987</link>
    <description>I&#39;m playing around with a 474 fixing up a few bugs getting ready for release and I was going to do some sort of a &quot;Seasonal shop&quot;. Here in the next month it&#39;ll be Christmas, so I put the Santa character, but you can only talk to him. How would I make it so when you talk to him, he trades?

All help is appreciated :)</description>
