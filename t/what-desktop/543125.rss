    <description>I&#39;m trying to purchase a desktop, preferably not Mac, and I&#39;m open to suggestions since I&#39;ve just been using a laptop for the past 5 years. I would attempt to build one but I cba to take the time. Budget is around 500 dollars.</description>

<p>Buying pre-made PC’s for $500 will be under-average for gaming. If you ever change your mind and decide to build your own, tell me and I can make you a decent build.<br>
[/quote]I do agree with this, you won’t be able to do much with a $500 machine. It will have a cpu with a basic integrated video card. You may be able to find a gt610 for around $550 in the build with your “connections” but the 610 is so basic it can’t run anything better than the intel 4000 integrated cards.</p>
<p>You can always get some barebone computers off of like Tigerdirect/Newegg for aroun d $200-300 and then add your own cpu for a cheaper price than buying the retail one itself.</p>

<p>Actually you’re wrong. My friends have built PCs for $450 that could run most games on average. If by gt610 you mean the GTX 610 graphics card, then you’re definitely wrong, because that’s a pretty solid video card.[/quote]I’m going to have to disagree with you…this is a $30-40 card that pulls very little power, and has a very minimal power requirement. Meaning, you may be able to play some games on  all of the lowest settings. But he shouldn’t expect to play anyt 2013-2014 games in high/ultra at any rate. call me picky all you want but there is no point in wasting that $30 on an almost nonexistent dedicated card when you could use that $30 to go towards a $200 card later on. Stay with the intel hd graphics or whatever until you get enough saved up for a real graphics card.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/nolan">@nolan</a> keep in mind you may need to upgrade the psu later on if you do decide to purchase a better gpu later on.</p>

<p>This is a build I just put together. It will be able to run probably any game but when settings have been lowered.</p>
<p>This is a pretty solid build, but if you are able to save up about $70 more, you can upgrade the graphics card to a GTX 660 which will be much better at running games.</p>

              <p>Putting your own shit together reduces the price so much, especially if you’re recycling things like power supply and case.  $500 is a pretty valid budget, given that you already have the peripherals.  If you have to spend the cash on that stuff, make sure you plan ahead.  Do things like get motherboards that have the capability to support future technologies so you can upgrade whenever/whatever.</p>

<p>Come on Nolan!Even though I do have to admit there have been times recently in 2013/2014 w2here a retail computer while was more expensive still came pretty  close to the actual price of the regular machine. I.e. I was  going to  build a computer for a client once but it was a very similar computer on BestBuy once that was on sale for only about $45 more.</p>
<p>So I guess it really depends on what you are looking for, what is on the market at that moment, how good your patience is, and what any retail differences are if there are any( which are rare true )</p>

<p>The PC they build is a little out of your price range, but don’t worry. It should be intuitive enough to dub down some of the parts they use to meet your budget.</p>
