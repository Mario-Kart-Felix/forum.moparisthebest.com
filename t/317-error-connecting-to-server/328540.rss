    <title>[317]Error connecting to server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-error-connecting-to-server/328540</link>
    <description>Ok, so I am running of ZeroScape source + client which seems to be going very well except no one can log on with the client. I have used a byte searcher and searched the whole client for 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1 and anything with no-ip and the only thing I can see to edit it is config.dat where it has 123noobscape321.servegame.com and many more ip adresses (e.g 123noobscape.servebeer.com, 123noobscape.no-ip.org) is this the file I should be changing to set my ip adress onto the clients? I have looked up heaps of tutorials and none seem to be able to help so maybe someone could help? Thanks</description>

              <p>the 3 most popular files that contain the server ip the client connects to is:</p>
<p>client.java<br>
gui.java<br>
EGUI.java</p>
<p>just search “server ip” in any of those and see if it brings you to anything.</p>
