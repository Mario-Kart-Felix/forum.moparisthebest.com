    <title>2 SUPER Simple PI auto save question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-super-simple-pi-auto-save-question/383065</link>
    <description>question 1.
In config.java it says this:
[code]
	public static final int SAVE_TIMER = 30; // save every 1 minute
[/code]
It doesn&#39;t say something about it saving it automatically in my servers brain I guess thats what you call it the run.bat or w/e lol...does it actually work?stupid question i know thats why its super simple :P

question 2.
when the auto restarter goes off it ends all java processes is what I heard and when I exit my server myself it says saving chars... or something like that would the auto restarter stop that? if the first question is no and if the second is yes then I have a 3rd question how would I make this auto save right? idc the way I make it auto save as long as it does..

PS make sure you tell which question your answering
