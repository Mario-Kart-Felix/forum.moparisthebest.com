    <title>Chinese Currency Manipulation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chinese-currency-manipulation/368908</link>
    <description>You may hear in the news about how China is manipulating the RMB or how Obama&#39;s proposal for regulations on currency trade with china was rejected by the G-20 members. So I&#39;ve decided to make a thread about it and voice my opinion.

First of all a little background:
The U.S. claims China is manipulating its currency by buying American bonds, this in return inflates the American dollar, while keeping the Yuan low. Why is this good? Because this takes advantage of the low-cost of the service sector in China, and makes exports look more attractive.

As a result, the U.S. claims that jobs are shipped from the U.S. straight to China, and that&#39;s why the whole entire world should gang up on China, probably bankrupting the whole entire country. The problem with this theory is that the jobs were never in the U.S. In the United States corporations have already developed hi-tech machinery that can do the job better than any american worker. And simply stiff-arming China isn&#39;t going to fix the problem of out-sourcing, corporations will just move to other developing countries like India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Brazil.

Not to mention, the U.S. just printed $600 billion dollars that&#39;s obviously some form of currency manipulation don&#39;t you think.

Sorry guys, this is the price of Capitalism, survival of the fittest. When we signed the constitution and laid down the stepping stones of what would become the free-market, we acknowledged that one day we would have to compete with other nations.

What the Obama administration is doing makes me sick. They have analysts that have a far more broad understanding of this than a 14-year old kid in highschool, but all he cares about is getting re-elected. He finally hit a topic that both republicans and democrats agree on and is taking advantage of the close-mindedness of the country. 
He needs to accept that he isn&#39;t getting re-elected and go back to trying to fix the economy. I mean seriously his approval ratings are lower than George Bush&#39;s were during his second term.</description>

The economy will naturally fluctuate. Just be careful on who you blame.</p>

<p>That’s why there was a new store opened up less than 10 miles from my home? I was hired in temporarily to help setup. Also, my Dad’s friend James opened up a Sprint store about 15 minutes from my house, did I get hired? No, but that was because I waited too long to put in an application.</p>

Obamas stimulus package would have worked if he wasn’t such an nigger.<br>
[/quote]fix’t[/quote]<br>
Niggers can be black and white, I suggest you start being a little less racist. People like you bring the world to a halt. Niggers are not educated by any means even, 99.5% of them never even graduated high school.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Topic</span> - Obama has been fucking up since he first got elected, he tried to outlaw guns and ammo. When that was shot down, he tried to put a 500% tax on all guns and ammo, just to get shot down again. Obama is only trying to protect his ass, not caring where he is headed, as long as he gets there safely.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/krackkid">@Krackkid</a> - Actually, jobs are getting better. My aunt, before she was killed, managed to keep her job because of Obama. My G’Ma, managed to keep her home because of Obama. I do approve of few things Obama has done, but as for jobs, I see more of those popping up around me these days. As for the oil spill, that was not Obama’s fault, that was BP trying to save a bit of money and not going the maintenance like they should have.</p>

              <p>You may hear in the news about how China is manipulating the RMB or how Obama’s proposal for regulations on currency trade with china was rejected by the G-20 members. So I’ve decided to make a thread about it and voice my opinion.</p>
<p>First of all a little background:<br>
The U.S. claims China is manipulating its currency by buying American bonds, this in return inflates the American dollar, while keeping the Yuan low. Why is this good? Because this takes advantage of the low-cost of the service sector in China, and makes exports look more attractive.</p>
<p>As a result, the U.S. claims that jobs are shipped from the U.S. straight to China, and that’s why the whole entire world should gang up on China, probably bankrupting the whole entire country. The problem with this theory is that the jobs were never in the U.S. In the United States corporations have already developed hi-tech machinery that can do the job better than any american worker. And simply stiff-arming China isn’t going to fix the problem of out-sourcing, corporations will just move to other developing countries like India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Brazil.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the U.S. just printed $600 billion dollars that’s obviously some form of currency manipulation don’t you think.</p>
<p>Sorry guys, this is the price of Capitalism, survival of the fittest. When we signed the constitution and laid down the stepping stones of what would become the free-market, we acknowledged that one day we would have to compete with other nations.</p>
<p>What the Obama administration is doing makes me sick. They have analysts that have a far more broad understanding of this than a 14-year old kid in highschool, but all he cares about is getting re-elected. He finally hit a topic that both republicans and democrats agree on and is taking advantage of the close-mindedness of the country.<br>
He needs to accept that he isn’t getting re-elected and go back to trying to fix the economy. I mean seriously his approval ratings are lower than George Bush’s were during his second term.</p>
