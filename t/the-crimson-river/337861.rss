The Crimson River
by Whitney Ale xander , Class of 2012
The giant conifers rustled in the slight June breeze. These giants surrounded everything.
They hugged the earth and protected this land. Always green, always present.
Almost ancient, they had seen many things. Many people had come and gone but
they remained. They were sad for all they had lost, but wise for all they had learned.
Perhaps this is how they grew, from each loss and gain, the lessons etched in the
rings of their trunks. On this day they would lose another. It would be a sad day for
the conifers here.
Laughter pierced the silence in this land between the mountains and the river.
Young laughter. Carefree laughter. Little boy laughter. No more school, just fun in
the mountains among the trees and the water for three whole months. The trees had
never witnessed such pure, honest, unconditional joy. The land loved these two little
boys and the boys loved the land right back. Little Boy One and Little Boy Two ran
and jumped and swam and rode under the protection of the conifers.
“Follow me,” said Little Boy Two. “I don’t think we should,” said Little Boy One.
But off they went to a place where they should not have been. Mistake one.
And they picked up cold steel playthings they should not have picked up.
Mistake two.
And Little Boy Two put a finger on a trigger he should not have put a finger on.
Mistake three.
And Little Boy One had a crimson river at his feet. A river that, like the one through
the giant conifers, continued to flow and flow and flow until there was no more.
Then Little Boy One was no longer amongst the mountains and the trees, no longer
with natural things. He lay under lights that were not the sun and on a hard table
that was not the earth. The healers tried to make the crimson river change its flow.
The healers stood over Little Boy One like the great conifers and tried to protect
him, their hands inside his body, massaging his empty crimson heart over and over
again. But like the river in the mountains, this river refused to change its tide.
The youngest healer began to cry. Like the youngest conifers, she had few rings.
Unlike the ancient conifers and the elder healers, she had not lost many things. She
was not as wise. So she cried. She had not yet learned that there would always be
another loss but also another gain. She had not learned what the swaying conifers
knew: That Little Boy One had jumped and played and run and laughed. For today,
the young healer saw only that day’s fleeting moment of sadness.
