    <description>I have a frame that has 5 options so i added a case for each one. I made the case numbers the same as the text places number(when you right click on click here to continue for instance, theres a number). It doesnt work though. Am I not supposed to do it that way? I have it some it closes all windows when you click on it under the frame and yes I did int the dialogue number.[br][size=1]Posted at: November 09, 2006, 04:22:42 PM[/size][hr]*Unsolved*</description>
