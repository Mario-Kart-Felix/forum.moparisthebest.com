<blockquote>ArtDC
<p>Hey IrishGuy,</p>
<p>You’ve deleted probably in under 2 minutes my wiki for ArtDC of which you defined as “Blatant Advertising”. This is a FREE group that does not make money and supports local artists in the D.C. area. I even wrote in the summary that i’d be adding links yet you appeared to have haphazardly deleted an important group in Washington D.C. Can you explain your logic and reasoning? —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Artindc (talk • contribs).</p>
<pre><code>It need not be commercial to be an advertisement. Based on your username, you are clearly here with the single purpose of advertising that group. Please read WP:COI. IrishGuy talk 01:04, 26 July 2007 (UTC)


Your presumptions are inaccurate. I'm not sure where you bought your crystal ball but you are inaccurate in what you are saying. The fact that you would delete an article based on someone's username clearly indicates that you are jumping to conclusions. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Artindc (talk • contribs).

    I deleted it based on the content, not based on your username. I pointed out your username as more evidence that you are a single purpose advertising account. IrishGuy talk 01:09, 26 July 2007 (UTC)

You just pointed me to COI (Conflict of Interest)- what does that have to do with trying to advertise? I don't really see your logic. I think you need to expound on your reasoning. You are assuming a great deal here which is simply not fair nor you cannot prove or specifically assert that the Wiki I was attempting to post was advertising or *information* on an *1800* member FREE arts group in Washington, D.C. So IrishGuy, tell me what your "first" evidence is that I have created a "single purpose advertising account". —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Artindc (talk • contribs).

    Are you joking? Your first edit was to create an article about the same subject your username is. It doesn't get any clearer than that. IrishGuy talk 01:16, 26 July 2007 (UTC)

    So, for example, you are one of about 15,000 artists in the D.C. metro area. You are an artist yourself (yes, I am an artist, maybe my alias gave that away), and you connecting that fact that my name is "ArtINDC" (although you seem to think that this is exactly the same as "ArtDC") that there is a conflict of interest? Does this mean that based on your name you can't write or comment about anything Irish?

        If you aren't even going to attempt to make valid points you can stop posting here. IrishGuy talk 01:30, 26 July 2007 (UTC)

    This is my last post discussing this because clearly I'm not getting anywhere. I have valid points but you choose not to respond to them. One valid point I may add is that your haste in deleting the article clearly validates the fact that you are racing through Wiki looking for things to delete. I requested you expound on your reasons yet all you have is empirical evidence to support your claim. However, if Wikipedia deletions are allowed based on editors presumptions and empirical evidence then I suppose you win this one. Thanks.—The preceding unsigned comment was added by Artindc (talk • contribs).

        So you instead resort to making personal attacks on other pages? You have no valid points. You are advertising that subject. You have a conflict of interest. A subject need not be commercial to be an advertisement. You haven't addressed any of those points. IrishGuy talk 01:43, 26 July 2007 (UTC)

What do personal attacks have to do with posting a new article? It's true, I did send a message to someone. Are we allowed to do that? I was chided by someone for doing it and I admitted to it. So, now what? Are you going to delete my account because I exercised my freedom of speech? Do you and I have to like each other in order for you not to delete the article I posted? I give up. I'm sure you're glad. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Artindc (talk • contribs).

    I do note that once again you failed to address any of the points made. Instead, you think the better route is to call me a nazi. IrishGuy talk 01:53, 26 July 2007 (UTC)

    Ooops! Did you catch that?

Freedom of Speech, first off. Second off, you would not clearly respond to any of my questions. I didn't violate any TOU and when you cited that I did violate it you could not prove or verify it. You did not expound on WHY you deleted the article. Therefore if you are responsible then my only recourse is to give up because it's clear that this is beating a dead horse and that you are clearly out to "win" this (as evidenced by the fact that you only assert yourself and do not actually answer my questions). And because you are the "police", I will go quietly. You'll probably even delete this, too. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Artindc (talk • contribs).

        Blah Blah Blah. Persecution. Blah.
        I note that only POV pushers, spammers, and vandals feel the need to constantly invoke Freedom of Speech. Although, they all seem to not even understand that constitutionally speaking, Freedom of Speech simply means the government cannot infringe on your rights...it says nothing about individuals, websites, etc. You have no inherent right to come to Wikipedia and hurl insults at others.
        I don't need to prove that you are a single purpose account and the fact that you continue to hide behind that simply illustrates how empty your argument truly is. Good day. IrishGuy talk 02:03, 26 July 2007 (UTC)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
