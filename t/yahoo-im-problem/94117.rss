    <title>Yahoo IM Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/yahoo-im-problem/94117</link>
    <description>Hey guys, recently (as in yesterday) I did the recovery process on my computer (Cleaned all my files off my hard  disk and returned to factory setting). Anyways, I went to re download Yahoo IM, which I did successfully, so I logged into IM only to find...

No one was on. I waited, waited, still no one was on. Trust me, I know my friends on IM, alot of people on my friends were on like all day. 

So, I tried sending an offline message to one of my friends. I typed my message in the blank, but when Id press enter, it wouldnt send it. It just deleted the message and it didnt show in the chat box.

So, does anyone have any idea what my problem is and what I can do to fix it?

Thanks for your help!  ;D</description>

              <p>I already re downloaded twice…So I doubt thats it. And I doubt its a YIM problem because it was only after I did the recovery process on my computer.</p>
<p>Any ideas on fixing an internet problem?</p>

              <p>Well it could be a YIM server problem, it could be an internet problem, or it could just be a bad download, if it is a bad download un-install your YIM then re-download it from Yahoo! and re-install.</p>
