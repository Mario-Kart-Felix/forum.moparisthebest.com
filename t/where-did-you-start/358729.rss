    <title>Where did you Start?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-did-you-start/358729</link>
    <description>  After working on private servers for awhile, a friend and I decided the best approach to this is to make our own from scratch. Taking others pre-made sources and clients is what most people do. Yes I know what your are thinking..

&quot;OH EM GEE this guy is such a loser, he can never learn what I do. You will never make anything. Go lick a tomato!&quot;

  Guys don&#39;t be harsh, I&#39;m watching a video series right now (87 Java Programming, 27 Intermediate Java Programming, and 35 Java Game Developing ). Is this the right approach? You think I would learn enough to make my own server from scratch? I&#39;m at lesson 35 right now and I&#39;ve literally memorized all of it. No exaggeration. 

  Next Question I have is about modeling. There isn&#39;t much that you can do with modeling private servers, there&#39;s a certain limit to what you can do. You can obviously make custom weapons. 

  Is Blender good for making private server customs? I know this much, it is very advanced and has animation options.

  Metasequoia is ok, but from looking at it somewhat briefly, it doesn&#39;t have much of an animation built into it. Apparently it&#39;s made by the Japanese so there&#39;s not many guides out there, half of the ones that I happen to come across are in Japanese.

  Again guys, don&#39;t buzz me off. I&#39;m not some desperate 12 year old kid who wants to be popular for making a private server. From the programming that I&#39;ve done so far(around 3 weeks or so) I do it because it&#39;s fun.</description>

<p>Thanks, modeling wasn’t for me though, it was for a friend.</p>

<p>I partially agree with that statement. Sometimes a video/tutorial can be found which can further explain how to use things in ways which you thought didn’t exist.</p>
