    <description>Hey guys, im having and issue right now with youtube. Im trying to make a channel with my google account but whenever i click &quot;My Channel&quot; A box opens up asking me to click continue. When i do click it, it just says &quot;Working...&quot; and stays there for hours until i exit the web browser. I am using Safari on my mac, and iv also tried on Windows 7 on &quot;Internet explorer, google chrome, and firefox&quot; but they all still have the same problem.</description>
