    <description>I know many of you who host your RSPS from home do the bittorrent/uttorent thing and use no-ip.com and it has worked for many. But i am here to show you guys how to completely forward your ports and make your server connect to you directly which makes it more efficient.

STEP 1:
You need to know what your IP address is and you need to make it your statistic IP.
You first start off with searching up cmd. When the black box shows up, you type in ipconfig or ipconfig/all. It doesnt really matter which one you do. Ipconfig/all just pops up more crap. You are going to need everything inside the little red box in the pic below

STEP 2:
For the next step, you need to open up your network connections. Do this by going to Control Panel&gt;Network Connections. Right click on whatever your connected to (mine is LAN) and click Properties. Then select Internet Protocal (TCP/IP) and you select the &quot;Use the following IP address&quot; option and insert everything from the cmd to the corresponding box.

Now as i said before, Windows 7 is a little different but the same concept so im going to get images from portforward.com. You go to control panel and look for Network and Internet. You then do View Network status and task&gt;Change adapter settings&gt;Right Click whatever your connection is, and do properties&gt;Then you select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IP). I forgot to mention above but for Windows 7, your IP in cmd will show up as IPv4 Address. Put the corresponding number in the correct box they should be in. (looks a bit messy but if you follow the steps, you should be alright)

STEP 3:
You&#39;ve set up your IP, now its time to forward your ports. In cmd, copy your Default Gateway to your web-browser and put in your Username and Password. IF you don&#39;t know what it is, they have a default list on portforward.com. Now depending on which router you have, this part is going to be different so go to portforward.com and click router list. Then search for the one you have then follow their steps. Im going to be using mine as an example which is Cisco. First you go to Application and Gaming, then a screen like the one below should show up and all you do is put in the port of your server (43594 or 43595 for some) and put in your IP address to the far right. *For me, i used 43590 and 43600 because that way it made a wider range for open ports when i host multiple servers.

STEP 4:
Now that your done doing that, you can use a portcheck tool if you want. Download the one one portforward.com or go to whatsmyip.org. Go to your client/source files and change the IP to yours. Compile it and check if it works (which it should). I only showed a picture of my source because i figured that you guys might think i advertised if i used my webclient as an example.
