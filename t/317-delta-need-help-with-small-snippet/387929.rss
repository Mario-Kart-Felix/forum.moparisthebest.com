    <title>[317 DELTA] Need help with small snippet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-need-help-with-small-snippet/387929</link>
    <description>what i thought would happen with this is, when you click the object, the item in your inventory is destroyed if its there and you are given 10k gp. if not presented with a message.

however nothing seems to happen

could someone show me what im doing wrong? 

here what i have
[CODE]if(objectID == 2452){
		if (playerHasItem(1436)) {
				deleteItem(1436, 1);
				addItem(995, 10000);
			} else {
				sM(&quot;You dont have any esssence.&quot;);
				}
				}[/CODE]

any help would be great



thanks
