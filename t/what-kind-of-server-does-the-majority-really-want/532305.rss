    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-kind-of-server-does-the-majority-really-want/532305</link>
    <description>hey guys im just trying to figure out -what players of RSC want as a Server?

I have a Pking Server out that players wanted and it seems there is a low player count. 
I&#39; am just trying to see what players of Runescape Classic WAnt.  Please post, so we can get a Server Done... I think The Pk Server That I Currently have up is great... fast fun and Easy...</description>

<p>iam right.  I played when runescape classic was the original game… then rs2 was a 3d version that was coming out… implying that the old version is rs1… now they are coming out with rs3… how do u not see that… ne ways…[/quote]Because it’s RSC, not RS1. The only time Jagex called it RS1 was when RS2 was in development and it would be confusing if they just said RuneScape. On the official release, they changed it from RS1 or just RS to RSC, and from RS2 to RS. Pretty much everyone still calls it RS2 though, and I’m sure it will continued to be called that seeing RS3 was already released. Also, I haven’t seen anything changing it from RS2 to anything else, and RS3 to RS.</p>
