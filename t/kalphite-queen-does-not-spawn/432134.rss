    <title>Kalphite Queen Does Not Spawn</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kalphite-queen-does-not-spawn/432134</link>
    <description>[CENTER]Hello, I am using DSPK Source and for some reason when I added KQ it does not respawn after killing it.

I have gone in the NPCHANDLER Class and it is located under:

[CODE] public int getRespawnTime(int i) {
		switch(npcs[i].npcType) {[/CODE]
[CODE]
			case 1158:
			return 70;[/CODE]

I cannot seem to figure it out. I have changed the respawn to 1 second, and  waited +30 minutes for it to spawn with no luck.

If any one has any idea how to fix this or what is going on, I will appreciate it.
