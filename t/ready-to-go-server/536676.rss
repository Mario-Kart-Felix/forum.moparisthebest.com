    <description>I would really like to download a working client of the 2004-2006 version of RS. What are my best choices?

I&#39;ve been playing for a long time I gave up a few years ago but I would really like to play some &quot;oldschool&quot; again but I just don&#39;t have the time to lvl up my character to what is was back in 04-06&#39; so what I really want to do is have my own server where I can mirror my 04-06&#39; Character to what is was back then and just start playing, doing solo boss fighting, barrows &amp; quests. I have no interest in ever making this a online server.

around 2007-8 I did actually have a server that my friends would sometimes play on but it was relatively useless with very little working, I&#39;m just hoping that maybe today years later we have something from 06 that we could consider fully working? or am I hoping for too much?

Thanks for any help!</description>

<p>So should I take that as a sort of answer to my question though, as you’re trying to make one I take it there is no 100% working copy of RS06. That’s a shame I would really like to play barrows again. Oh well thanks!</p>
