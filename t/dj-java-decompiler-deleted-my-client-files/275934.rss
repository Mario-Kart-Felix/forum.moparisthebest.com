    <title>Dj java decompiler deleted my client files!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dj-java-decompiler-deleted-my-client-files/275934</link>
    <description>so.
i had some kind of dj java decompiler.
there&#39;s java class files that are memory or something.
i was changing something and i accidently moved the client.java into config.
but i set it back to it real place.
and when i put my server back online all the new things i added to client.java were vanished and they were the old
client.java.
everytime i added something to client.java and compile nothing happens, nothing actually ever.

if i move or delete the decompiler of client.java and i restart server and it sais that the client isnt exsisting.

or do i have to delete the decompiler itself?
please help me!</description>
