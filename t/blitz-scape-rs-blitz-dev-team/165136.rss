    <description>Server Dev. Project For: Blitz-Scape

Informantion: This is a brand new development team. Yes we will be creating a server, and a good one at that. I&#39;ve been in mopar for around a year, and always wanted to create the &quot;perfect server&quot;, but never really got around to it. The goal is for the entire server to open by January 20th, or earlier. We will be dedicated, have a site, mySQL(maybe not, but ill see), and of course complete forums. The team will consist of 5 skilled coders, 1 Head admin, 2 forum Admins (these people will set up the forums), and 4 site coders (will code the site). Im not asking for proof of some piece of work thats probably leeched, if your not good, im just going to believe you wont join. I wont pick the Head Admin for a while. I want to get to know everyone.

Purpose: I am really getting tired of the servers where you click a haybale and get lvl 99 and 2 billion coins. Its annoying, and unbalanced. So im going to make one thats completely unannoying, and balanced out. Hopefully we&#39;ll be the most popular server out there. 

Location: I would like to have the server spread out all over runescape. But since thats every servers goal, and it almost never happens, I would like to make it based somewhere completely new. I mean completely. This means, custom shops, pvp interface, and possibly coding a new location.

Forums: blitzscape.ipbfree.com, will be upgrading to vbulliten with a week. Just have to download and upload.

Applications:

Name:
Job:
Online Time:
MSN:
AIM:
Why are you a good candidate for the job?
Extra information:

Pretty basic, im not requiring anything proof wise. All i want is a good team, that actually works as a team.

Client: Will include some custom items, not to many. And they will be released over time.All 3rd age, skillcapes, and all that stuff will be on the client. 471 cache, obviously, closed, and encrypted. 

Server: Based of an easy source, and has almost every skill. I hate some of them. I would also like to code the grand exchange in if possible.

Thats all for now, ill update as it progresses. 

We will update in 7 stages:

Beta- A rough draft of everything.
Alpha- A revision, cleaning out server, and bugs.
Version 1- New items added, starting location coded
Version 2- More items added, bugs fixed, skills added
Version 3- New interfaces, possibly mySQL, site, and forums completed
Version 4- Entire world coded. This means doors, shops, emotes, the whole shibang
Final Edition- Everything finished. This includes bugs, doors/emotes, locations, shops, commands, skills, site, forums, server status, highscores, teleports fixed, interfaces, admin accounts made, staff page, and all items complete and debugged. The Client.Java size will be pretty big. So i doubt we will ever release the actual server.

Estimated Time Until Beta Release: 4 days.

[i]This thread will automatically update from the server check list in [21] hours.[/i]</description>
