    <title>Logout Timer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/logout-timer/256389</link>
    <description>Firstly, the logout timer has been increased from ninety seconds to five minutes. This means that you will not be automatically logged out before this amount of time has passed – particularly useful when you want to check the forums or the Game Guide while training combat or chopping down trees.

BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUULSHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT

Do you know how many years we all had to put up with that stupid logout timer, having to play the guessing game when afk. Now I can fucking browse the forums for 5 mins just like every other jackoff on RuneScape who has just started playing. I&#39;m getting sick of all these advantages they get.</description>

Don’t just interpret my dissatisfaction with the game as an immature outlook on life. I understand fully that life continues to grow and technology advances. I just have played games like Counter-Strike where there are zero updates it seems like. And I like it that way, it makes it fair for everyone who plays, old and new.<br>

<p>Obviously you didn’t play CS back in the day…[/quote]</p>
<p>I meant in general, I didn’t mean like the early life of the game. That’s different, that’s updates which are needed.</p>

They want more players, so they’ll do anything to rake in a few. It’s a company, and company’s have one final goal: profit. And because they aren’t really polluting or the cause of animal cruelty, they don’t give a #### how that profit is gained. If it means that they have to ruin their game, losing the first players, getting rid of the ‘heart’ of the game, while gaining extra players, they are happy.</p>
<p>But I think it sucks nonetheless. RSC wasn’t as good looking, but way better then RS2.<br>

<p>Please tell me how. You have to be a member and have been playing RSC in the past 6 months to be able to play, or choose for a private server which plainly sucks.</p>

              <p>No, I just think that that is an unfair advantage, players have been given many recently. I mean it’s helpful for people who play. But people who Woodcut, or something of the sort, every minute you’d have to click away from what you were doing to make sure you don’t log out. People who had a hard time doing it, and made it to lvl 99 or something, or high levels, may find it unfair.</p>
