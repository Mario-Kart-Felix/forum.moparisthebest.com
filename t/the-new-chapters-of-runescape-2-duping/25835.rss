    <description>Yes, I am talking about a duping glitch. You did not need to know how to program or anything, it was just a simple bug which... allowed you to dupe..... 

1 person knew about it. You may know him. Pyro 214 of sythe.org

this is his character and here is the video of him duping items, about a month ago.

I dont know if jagex has fixed the bug or not. All i know that this is a very recent factor. It proves that runescape bugs and glitches are still alive.

Here you go folks, Sorry to dissapoint you if you thought this would teach you how to do it.

Once again, this video is made by me, i am jamesoxley12.

Be sure to leave a comment :P!

              <p>Take the vid off youtube, and take out the link. This will lead to a lot of unwanted crap…</p>
<blockquote>Hey, Dorito here, just thought I'd straighten out what really did and what didn't happen. This post will explain just about everything you've been wondering and probably more.
<p>First off, pyro_214 did find a dupe, that did work. After watching his video, and contacting him, I too, found a way to do it, mostly by accident, but none the less I did. At the current moment there was only 2 people that knew it, pyro_214 and myself[Dorito]. Now, I shall explain what exactly happened so hopefully you can understand it better now.</p>
<p>First off, this bug required a previous bug that was found by haxes_pwns on Tainted Ones.</p>
<p>This bug made it possible to do a simple forced teleport. First, you went to Castle Wars, and waited for the game to start or join in an existing game. Then, once the game started, and you were in the waiting room, you had to click on the exit game portal. But just before you got there you had to logout, so the screen would say loading please wait while you are logging out.</p>
<p>Then, you logged back in, in the waiting room, BUT you were still in the castle wars game, but just not IN it physically. Then you exited the waiting room like normal, but you still had the attack and take-from options from castle wars.</p>
<p>After that, you simply teleported to the duel arena, and stake the item you wanted duped. From here on it is very sketchy as neither I or pyro_214 really documented this, nor understood it very well.</p>
<p>We staked the item or items we wanted duped to our friend. The friend staked nothing and clicked accept as did I. Then, we went into the duel, all we did was wait until the castle wars game ended, meaning he wouldn’t atk me or vise versa. Once the castle wars game ended I would be teleported back to castle wars’ lobby. Yet, my friend would still be in the duel.</p>
<p>So, once again I teleport back to the duel arena and duel another person, meanwhile my friend is still in the duel, with no player to atk. So, I duel the random player, and guess what? The items I staked earlier are already up there <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/open_mouth.png?v=9" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"> shocking isn’t it? After that, I accept, and then I x-out, since I had two duels going on at once, I x-ed out and got my items back from both of them. So I log back in, and woot, we just duped our items.</p>
<p>I only successfully duped 5 sharks, after that I never got enough time to really test it much further.</p>
<p>The castle wars bug has been fixed, I repeat, THE CASTLE WARS BUG HAS BEEN FIXED!</p>
<p>This was simply to try to explain to people and to stop all the spam posts about this dupe bug.</p>
<p>pyro_214 did it a little differently that I, like I said I found my own method. You could of tried what I wrote before and it wouldn’t of worked that is simply because there are many small things and timing that I couldn’t even put in either because I simply didn’t remember or I, myself still didn’t even understand therefore I couldn’t explain it to you people.</p>
<p>I hope this will answer all the questions people had and stop all the people saying it was fake or real or I GOT THE DUPE BUG TOO, SELLING IT FOR 500M…</p>
<p>With that, I shall end this.</p>
<p>-Dorito</p>
