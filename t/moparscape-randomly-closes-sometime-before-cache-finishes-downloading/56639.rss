    <title>Moparscape randomly closes sometime before cache finishes downloading</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-randomly-closes-sometime-before-cache-finishes-downloading/56639</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t been able to play the game yet because of what I described in the title. My first few tries were on the online version at moparisthebest.com, in which case all of my browser windows would suddenly close, but now I&#39;m trying with the jar version and that&#39;s the only thing that closes. I&#39;ve tried at least ten times now. Why is this happening, and why doesn&#39;t the download pick up where it leaves off?</description>

<p>Any idea what’s up? I tried deleting and redownloading it, but same thing. Also, I don’t know if this means anything, but the download was acting a bit stange. What I mean by that is that it was downloading at around 200mbps according to the computer (and the estimated-finish timer was lined up as such), but only about 100kb’s got added to the download every five seconds instead of a megabyte. Weird.</p>
