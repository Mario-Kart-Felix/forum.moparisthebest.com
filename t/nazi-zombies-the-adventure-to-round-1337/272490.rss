    <title>Nazi Zombies - the adventure to round 1337</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nazi-zombies-the-adventure-to-round-1337/272490</link>
    <description>It has failed. I wonder if I&#39;ll try again.

Anyways, I decided to place on the global high scores for Rounds Survived on Verruckt as I had learned about a barrier glitch. I hopped into the invincibility spot and all was going well for a while. I ran out of ammo around round 6, and then had to go up and get some better guns. On my first trip to the random weapon box, I got a PPSH-41 and then Molotov cocktails. The crawler that was chasing me bled out as I got a teddy bear, so I rushed to find the random weapon box once more.

I found the weapon box and with a Hail Mary effort I got the flamethrower. Let the fun begin ;).

Everything went wonderfully; I started soaring through the rounds. I think the rounds were going at a minute or so each until round 30.

Anyways.. here&#39;s where the pictures come in.

At round 49 my friends on IRC told me to document my success (or lack there of, it would seem). So, I began to take a picture every 50 rounds. This seemed easy enough, so I decided to do it.

Round 50 can be seen here (and all the charred zombie remains to prove it!):

The rounds started to fly by as my right index finger got into the rhythm of pressing R1 every few seconds. This allowed me to close my eyes well enough, and then I would have someone /notice me on IRC every ten minutes to wake me up just in case I fell asleep. 

When I approached round 69, I decided to be cute and take a picture for my real life friends for them to giggle at. 

I got the picture alright:

When I picked up my controller again, I moved forward. Immediately I panicked. Zombies were about to come in! I leaped for the invincibility spot once more in a last attempt to save myself. As I jumped, the zombies broke in. To my utter disbelief, I was saved. I went back at it, and decided to keep my hand off the left analog stick for awhile. 

I employed my /notice strategy so I could close my eyes for a few minutes, keeping me feeling comfortable. This strategy did it&#39;s job when I fell asleep by accident. I woke up on round 86. Worried, I decided to put headphones in and play some music to keep myself awake (Shocker on Shock Street - Dr. Acula, to be exact - that will keep you awake, I guarantee it). 

It all went smoothly again and I reached the round 100 goal.

It is now 2:47 A.M.

I started updating my friends every five levels, making it easier on me. I reached level 110 around 3:00 A.M. I had 470,000 or so points by the time I was on level 110. When level 115 rolled around, I updated my friends once more. Then 120. Then 122...

And then it happened.

I disconnected from IRC. Hoping for the best, I continued playing. And then horror came to my eyes as &quot;E-Deity renamed to Player&quot; flashed into my screen. I went to bed thinking it was over, but still leaving the Playstation on just in case. I woke up at 9:00 A.M this morning to find my Playstation off.

I&#39;ll attempt it later, but in all honesty I won&#39;t do it over night ;).

Don&#39;t spam the thread with &quot;omfg u fag glticher omg ur so gey ruin it 4 evry one else god i haet u go die nub1!&quot;, it&#39;s just annoying. If you don&#39;t want to read it then don&#39;t. 

Anyone still interested? The glitch I used can be found [url=http://www.nextgenupdate.com/vb/nazi-zombies-discussion-glitches/30982-call-duty-5-world-war-nazi-zombie-glitches-new-barrier-glitch-clan-fear.html]here[/url].
