    <description>Hey,

I used Heaven pkz to build on because at the time i liked the new interfaces, but now i want to be able to use other clients with my source. But as soon as i log in with another client i get dced, is this due to anti-leech which i have never removed or due to signlink or something.

I would appreciate helpful posts please.

Thank you for reading</description>

<p>It might not be an anti-leach, it might only allow specific UID’s to connect to the server, or might have some things missing from the clients your trying to to use which the server needs, for example, bluurs doesn’t work on all servers.</p>
