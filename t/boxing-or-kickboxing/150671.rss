tbh both kick-boxing and boxing are too much of a sport. If you want to defend your self learn something such as karate as you use all styles of attack. A good tip is karate and judo are mainly self defence and use things such as blocks and throws more often to pin someone to the ground so they cannot hurt you etc. Ju Jitsu also involves hurting your apponent and they will teach you to punch correctly and kick so you kind of do both kick boxing and boxing. If you can only choose between those 2 though I’d say go kick boxing the majority of people you fight will be idiots and do the same punch every time. Just hook your arm around there punching arm as they swing forward so that you push there fist out the way then swing forwards starting with your clenched fist vertical then rotate it so it is horrizontal as you swing forwards and aim straight for the fleshy part of their nose if done hard enough it will break and may make a huge spray of blood like on films etc. Depending on who it is this may make them back down as a broken nose is VERY painful if they don’t you can repeat as similar technique aiming for there chin or temple both good places to hit. also if you ever end up side on to someone a good move is to spin round and lash out with a karate chop to the throat this can kill so be careful sometimes they just spit up a load of blood.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I appreciate it you took some time to write your reply but there are some incorrect things you mentioned in your reply.<br>
First of all , who told you i wanted to defend myself?<br>
Second of all, you said i should do kick boxing because the most people i fight will be idiots.This is not true, i wouldn’t even bother fighting someone who cant even throw a decent punch back.[/quote]</p>
<p>well generally when you dont defend yourself in a fight people beat the crap out of you… And you seem to be the same type of idiot as i was talking about(why the fuck are you on the internet?) They can probably throw a decent punch back and may be strong etc but I am talking about mental weaknesses e.g making the wrong decisions but idc. If you wan’t to go about hurting people for fun don’t bother learning a martial art might as well throw punches and just learn from beating up smaller people first.</p>

<p>tbh both kick-boxing and boxing are too much of a sport. If you want to defend your self learn something such as karate as you use all styles of attack. A good tip is karate and judo are mainly self defence and use things such as blocks and throws more often to pin someone to the ground so they cannot hurt you etc. Ju Jitsu also involves hurting your apponent and they will teach you to punch correctly and kick so you kind of do both kick boxing and boxing. If you can only choose between those 2 though I’d say go kick boxing the majority of people you fight will be idiots and do the same punch every time. Just hook your arm around there punching arm as they swing forward so that you push there fist out the way then swing forwards starting with your clenched fist vertical then rotate it so it is horrizontal as you swing forwards and aim straight for the fleshy part of their nose if done hard enough it will break and may make a huge spray of blood like on films etc. Depending on who it is this may make them back down as a broken nose is VERY painful if they don’t you can repeat as similar technique aiming for there chin or temple both good places to hit. also if you ever end up side on to someone a good move is to spin round and lash out with a karate chop to the throat this can kill so be careful sometimes they just spit up a load of blood.</p>

<p>I appreciate it you took some time to write your reply but there are some incorrect things you mentioned in your reply.<br>
First of all , who told you i wanted to defend myself?<br>
Second of all, you said i should do kick boxing because the most people i fight will be idiots.This is not true, i wouldn’t even bother fighting someone who cant even throw a decent punch back.</p>

Well personally, If your going for it as self defence sort of thing, I’d go for boxing, seriously when the fuck are you going to kick someone in the head when they are stood up when they could just grab your leg and knock seven shades of shit out of you.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes, but if you’re good you’re fast enough to either hit them first or block their attempt to grab you.<br>
Do both, ha.[/quote]</p>
<p>Good point, but if they are the same size as you, it will be a bitch to try to get them to release your leg whilst balancing on one foot.</p>
