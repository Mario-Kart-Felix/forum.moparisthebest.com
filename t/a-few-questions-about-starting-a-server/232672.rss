    <title>A few questions about starting a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions-about-starting-a-server/232672</link>
    <description>Hi, I had a server but it closed down over a year ago.
Back then it ran on my only computer, However now I have 4 computers and can dedicated one to running my server, I want to know how much my Internet Download / Upload speed matters as far as the server goes, For example... I have a basic server setup on my 1GBPS LAN, and my Brother and I can play just fine without any lag on a 600MHz CPU with a RS Server running on it.

My download speed is ~4000KBPS
My upload speed is ~400KBPS

When I ran my server before, I lived in KY and we had ~ 9MB Download and 5MB Upload,

So will my speed make the server lag? or does it not matter as much?

Just to make it clear, The server will run on my old computer with a 600KHz CPU &amp; 512MB RAM.

Thanks.</description>

              <p>I recall haveing 30 people on my server and it only sucking ~300MB Of my RAM…And my old server was bloated with a bunch of shit, So if anything I expect this to run smoother <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>I’m not a expert by i do know that ram plays a big part in it along with internet connection and speed but i would jes tmake sure that you have liek 1gb of ram or 2 and you should be fine. with like 512 ram u would lagg bad because servers suck up ram.<br>

              <p>Thanks for the input, I will probubly strip the server I downloaded of all unnecessary NPC’s, The server will be fun, But without every freaking feature known to man, Ya know?</p>
<p>Like I said before, my Brother and I can play comfortable without any lag on our LAN, Hope that does not change for  WAN.</p>

              <p>there’s not really a big difference. I mean if you have a computer set up for gaming and stuff it might make the performance better. but i doubt most of us use something like that just to run a pserve. i got a decent computer here and it runs fine. i would say that more crap that you don’t need on a server will lag everyones play time tough. so don’t put a bunch of unneeded npc’s and stuff.</p>
