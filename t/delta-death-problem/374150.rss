    <title>(Delta) Death Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-death-problem/374150</link>
    <description>I just need help on a part where, as the player dies and respawns back to he/she&#39;s designated coordinates. They teleport back to the spot they died and do not see their items that dropped as they died.

On the other hand, when another person is with the player that dies, the other person can see the item that the person that died has dropped but when the person that died teleports back to the spot he still cannot see his dropped items.

Sometimes what the person has died does is stand there for 3-5minutes until his items appears but it is too late for him to pick it up since it disappears as it appears for him.

I need to know how to fix this problem and if anyone can kindly give me an idea on where to look then It will be appreciated greatly.</description>
