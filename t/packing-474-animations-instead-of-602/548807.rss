    <title>Packing 474 animations instead of 602</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/packing-474-animations-instead-of-602/548807</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;I don&#39;t usually do this stuff, So i really need help from you guys.

So i have this ( PI 317-377? i don&#39;t really know lol ) loading 602 animations and NPC&#39;s, Which is horribly ugly. What i wanted to do is change those animations to 474 instead aswell as NPC&#39;s , I got the whole 474 Data package ( npcs anims maps etc.. ), For now i just want to change animations and npcs.

So what i did was use galkons method, Which was already in the server i downloaded. And i put the 474 animations in [i]cache/index1/[/i]
So i added repackCacheIndex(1); at the startup method to load the new animations. But i get the error:

[code]Started repacking index 1.
Error packing cache index 1.
Finished repacking 1.[/code]

What could have i done wrong? Help is very appreciated  :)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevermind, I had placed the [i]repackCacheIndex(1);[/i] in the wrong place inside the code.</description>
