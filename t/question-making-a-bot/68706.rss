    <title>Question: Making a bot?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-making-a-bot/68706</link>
    <description>For some time now I&#39;ve wanted to learn Java, but never got past the System.out.Println(&quot;hello world!&quot;);. :(

I&#39;ve seen how a few previous bots work, IBot using modified java, Arga using modified BCEL(or BCEL hacks)(sorry I&#39;m not so sure how either work, only know what I&#39;ve heard), all I know about Aryan was it was a modified game client with a few modifications so a script could control it. Not sure about any previous bots, but I&#39;m wondering, how much work and dedication would it take to make a bot? I&#39;m guessing it would take months(3+?) of studying java, few weeks(2-3?) of planning and again a few weeks(3-9?) of assembling the bot and testing it. Could anyone give me a rough estimate on it?</description>

              <p>Practice making a bot first x]  Updating can come next.  I think when making the bot you’ll learn a little bit more, then getting that updating part will come easier.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:2, topic:68706”]Making an actual bot isn’t that hard, you can do it any number of ways and still have it undetectable, the hard part is working out the updating.  Every week, sometimes more often than that, jagex releases a new client.  The structure doesn’t change much/at all but everything is renamed and all the static fields/methods are scrambled among random classes, so in order to find what you want you have to write patterns, and you can only do that after you find what all the fields you want are.  In my opinion writing the auto updater is the hardest and most time consuming part of any bot.</p>
<p>In fact you can just work on the autoupdater and use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cherokee" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Cherokee</a> as the base.[/quote]</p>
<p>The auto updater isn’t exactly…hard. Its defiantly time consuming. Also gets very very boring. So for the updater alone, it takes a lot time, and dedication. I think ARGA’s updater is about 5k lines. You also need to be able to find the fields, methods etc before writing the actual updater, also time is needed to look for traps etc.</p>
<p>Took us a good few months to make ARGA. However thats because we went through a lot of changes :p. For example, we never always used bcel.</p>
