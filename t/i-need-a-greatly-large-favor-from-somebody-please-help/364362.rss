    <description>Hello, I am Josh I am currently wanting to work on a game I want to use a base off of moparscape, and get rid of all the models in game, and I would like to start from sratch. No skills in the game, no money nothing, but the files required to make it. I will be working on this for the next couple months / years. I am hoping to make this like runescape, but has a comeplty different feel to it. I would like to try, and work towards making this like the following games. &quot;world of warcraft&quot;, &quot;Runescape&quot;, &quot;Perfect world&quot; and &quot;combat arms&quot; I know this will be a lot of work. many years will be have to put into it, but I feel That while I do this It will also teach me how to code, and I won&#39;t feel ashamed of playing Runescape Private servers. I only acually played to learn how to do this. Now here is you&#39;re chance to help. I require a:

* Source with only the required Files to play it
*client with no models
*Have the the Files to play and add stuff


Thank you all for your help.</description>

I want to use this but get rid of it all and, make it a completly new game.</p>
