    <title>I always get an error while trying to debug a C++ file</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-always-get-an-error-while-trying-to-debug-a-c-file/104820</link>
    <description>Whenever I try to debug a C++ file on Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition, I get an error. If the Solution Configurations are on Debug, and I start Debugging, I get this error.
&lt;blockquote&gt;------ Build started: Project: Shop, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------
Linking...
LINK : fatal error LNK1168: cannot open C:\Documents and Settings\john m jennings\My Documents\Visual Studio 2005\Projects\Shop\Debug\Shop.exe for writing
Build log was saved at &quot;file://c:\Documents and Settings\john m jennings\My Documents\Visual Studio 2005\Projects\Shop\Debug\BuildLog.htm&quot;
Shop - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)
========== Build: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And if I have it on release to generate a .bat file (Which I wanted), I get this error.
&lt;blockquote&gt;------ Build started: Project: Shop, Configuration: Release Win32 ------

Build log was saved at &quot;file://c:\Documents and Settings\john m jennings\My Documents\Visual Studio 2005\Projects\Shop\Release\BuildLog.htm&quot;
Shop - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)
========== Build: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, last night I was at my cousin&#39;s house. He had a way earlier version of the Microsoft C++ program, and I used it. I managed to actually make a working batch file, and everything would be right. I had in this code (All I can remember right now).
[code]#include &quot;stdafx.h&quot;

main()
{
	int money;
	printf(&quot;Input the amount of money you want.\n&quot;);
	scanf(&quot;$%d\n&quot;, money);
	money = %d;
	printf(&quot;Money increased.\n&quot;);
	getchar();
}[/code] Now, if I put that in there, I get an error. That worked fine on the other. So, two questions.

1. Did the Microsoft C++ Program thing that was from 1995 or so update/change the C++ language up to the 2005&#39;s version?
2. Will someone tell me what&#39;s wrong when I try to debug :o

Thanks,

<p>I used the Microsoft C++ Development 5.0, and I managed to make a crappy program that tells how old you will be in the year you put in from the age you put in. I can’t attatch, because I made at my cousin’s. But I think I remember what it looked like.</p>

}[/code] I’m not sure if that was the complete thing, but I made it work. Anyways, where can I get something else to code C++?</p>
