    <title>My employer not allowing me to take holiday</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-employer-not-allowing-me-to-take-holiday/346501</link>
    <description>Basically, I&#39;ve paid for a ticket for a festival that is in 2 weeks. Last week, the my boss told me that because of short staffing I wont be able to take that weekend off, yet he allows another full-time guy there to take the time off. I&#39;ve been working there for 2 fucking years every weekend, and they give some other new full time guy priority. 

They said to me that if I do not turn up to work that weekend, they will fire me, so I&#39;m trying to work out a plan so I can quit and get another job, but now I&#39;m worried about not giving enough notice, so I wont be able to go anyway. 

Are they allowed to refuse me to take a weekend off? If they are, are they allowed to fire me for not turning up to work/calling in sick without a doctors note?</description>

<p>Who said he had a union?  Plus, here, overtime is more than 8 hours a day or more than 40 hours a week, and you must be paid 1.5 times your normal wage.  (so if you make $10/hour you must be paid $15/hour for overtime)</p>
<p>And there is no mandatory amount of vacation days a year or anything, the above laws are pretty much it.  Who knows what they are in england though.</p>

              <p>Depends on the employer/boss/company.  Maybe you can go up higher?  Like corporate or something, or if you are very important to your boss just tell him a few days before that you won’t be in because they already told you you could have them off and you are going.</p>
<p>I worked at a meijer (like a walmart supercenter) from 16-20ish, and at slightly over 18 I requested off for a friday night about 6 months in advance for my high school graduation.  When time got close, they told me I had to NOT go to my high school graduation and instead come into work for a 5 hour shift.  I explained over and over that I’d worked there ever since I was legally able to so I could save money for college and graduate high school, and that I wasn’t going to miss it, they didn’t listen.  So wednesday night I called and told them I wasn’t going to come in friday, I wasn’t going to call off, and if they wrote me up or fired me or anything I would take it to corporate, the union, local newspapers or whatever I had to do.  I didn’t come in, and they never said another word about it.  I guess I called their bluff. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>So you could try the same, but be aware of the possible consequences.</p>

              <p>hmm, I’m not too sure tbh with you. I think i’m allowed 14 days paid holiday a year, and I have had one day of that. I’m not really sure of the actual policy, also as I’m part time its gunna be slightly different.</p>
<p>[quote=“TheBeanie, post:3, topic:346501”]Uh most places say that your entitled to holidays… but your employer can still say no… How many days is it? its usually a week for 1 day off + 2 weeks for two weeks off…</p>
<p>I would go to citizens advice just to make sure.[/quote]</p>
<p>I guess I’ll go to citizens advice and see what they say. I just want to punch my stupid fuck off a boss square in the nose…</p>
<p>EDIT - Just looking through the internets now I already see that they aren’t legally obliged to give me the days off, and can terminate my contract whenever they wish. FUCKERS. Guess I’ll fuck the festival and make my bosses life really fucking hard.</p>

              <p>Basically, I’ve paid for a ticket for a festival that is in 2 weeks. Last week, the my boss told me that because of short staffing I wont be able to take that weekend off, yet he allows another full-time guy there to take the time off. I’ve been working there for 2 fucking years every weekend, and they give some other new full time guy priority.</p>
<p>They said to me that if I do not turn up to work that weekend, they will fire me, so I’m trying to work out a plan so I can quit and get another job, but now I’m worried about not giving enough notice, so I wont be able to go anyway.</p>
<p>Are they allowed to refuse me to take a weekend off? If they are, are they allowed to fire me for not turning up to work/calling in sick without a doctors note?</p>
