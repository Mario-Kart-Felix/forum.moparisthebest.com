    <description>Because in Australia the public aren&#39;t welcome when it comes to the governing of the country.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The federal government has censored approximately 90 per cent of a secret document outlining its controversial plans to snoop on Australians&#39; web surfing, obtained under freedom of information (FoI) laws, out of fear the document could cause &quot;premature unnecessary debate&quot;.

The government has been consulting with the internet industry over the proposal, which would require ISPs to store certain internet activities of all Australians - regardless of whether they have been suspected of wrongdoing - for law-enforcement agencies to access.

All parties to the consultations have been sworn to secrecy.

Industry sources have claimed that the controversial regime could go as far as collecting the individual web browsing history of every Australian internet user, a claim denied by the spokesman for Attorney-General Robert McClelland.

The exact details of the web browsing data the government wants ISPs to collect are contained in the document released to this website under FoI.

The document was handed out to the industry during a secret briefing it held with ISPs in March.

But from the censored document released, it is impossible to know how far the government is planning to take the policy.

The government is hiding the plans from the public and it appears to want to move quickly on industry consultation, asking for participants to respond within only one month after it had held the briefings.

------------------------------------------

The Attorney-General&#39;s Department legal officer, FoI and Privacy Section, Claudia Hernandez, wrote in her decision in releasing the highly-censored document that the release of some sections of it &quot;may lead to premature unnecessary debate and could potentially prejudice and impede government decision making&quot;.

Hernandez said that the material in question related to information the department was &quot;currently weighing up and evaluating in relation to competing considerations that may have a bearing on a particular course of action or decision&quot;.

&quot;More specifically, it is information concerning the development of government policy which has not been finalised, and there is a strong possibility that the policy will be amended prior to public consultation,&quot; she wrote.

Further, she said that although she had acknowledged the public&#39;s right to &quot;participate in and influence the processes of government decision making and policy formulation ... the premature release of the proposal could, more than likely, create a confusing and misleading impression&quot;.

&quot;In addition, as the matters are not settled and proposed recommendations may not necessarily be adopted, release of such documents would not make a valuable contribution to public debate.&quot;

Hernandez went further to say that she considered disclosure of the document uncensored &quot;could be misleading to the public and cause confusion and premature and unnecessary debate&quot;.

&quot;In my opinion, the public interest factors in favour of release are outweighed by those against,&quot; Hernandez said.

The &quot;data retention regime&quot; the government is proposing to implement is similar to that adopted by the European Union after terrorist attacks several years ago.

Greens Communications spokesman Scott Ludlam said the excuse not to release the proposal in full was &quot;extraordinary&quot;. Since finding out about the scheme, he has launched a Senate inquiry into it and other issues.

&quot;The idea that its release could cause &#39;premature&#39; or &#39;unnecessary&#39; debate is not going to go down well with the thousands of people who have been alarmed by the direction that government is taking,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.

&quot;I would really like to know what the government is hiding in this proposal,&quot; he said, adding that he hoped that the Attorney-General&#39;s Department would be &quot;more forthcoming&quot; about the proposal in the senate inquiry into privacy he pushed for in June.

Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, George Brandis, said the government’s decision to censor the documents showed ‘‘how truly Orwellian this government has become&quot;.

&quot;To refuse disclosure of material that had already been circulated among stakeholders, on an issue of intense current political debate on the ground that it might provide unnecessary discussion, shows that the Gillard government has become beyond satire,&quot; Brandis said.

Online users&#39; lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia spokesman Colin Jacobs said what was released was &quot;a joke&quot;.

&quot;We have to assume the worst,&quot; he said. &quot;And that is that the government has been badgering the telcos with very aggressive demands that should worry everybody.&quot;

Jacobs said that the onus was now on government to &quot;explain what data they need, what problem it solves and, just as importantly, why it can&#39;t be done in an open process&quot;.

&quot;The more sensitive the process and the data they want, the more transparent the government needs to be about why it wants that data,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody could argue that public consultation ... would somehow help criminals,&quot; he added.

&quot;We have to turn the age-old question back on the government: if you don’t have anything to hide, then you shouldn&#39;t be worried about people having insight into the consultation.

&quot;This is a very sensitive and important issue. It raises huge questions about privacy, data security and the burden of increased costs to smaller internet service providers. What really needs to be debated is what particular information they want, because that&#39;s where the privacy issue rears its ugly head,&quot; he said.

According to one internet industry source, the release of the highly censored document was &quot;illustrative of government&#39;s approach to things where they don&#39;t want people to know what they&#39;re thinking in advance of them getting it ready to package for public consumption&quot;.

&quot;And that’s worrying.&quot;

The Attorney-General&#39;s spokesman declined to comment, referring comment to the department. The department said it had &quot;nothing to add&quot; to the FOI letter it provided.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

First of all, the chance of that happening is about as big as them getting shot in some state in USA. Secondly, that “mindset” is propaganda. You are in a war, war spawns propaganda and it always will, which results in people believing this bullshit (very much like yourself).</p>
<p>I agree, that is not realistic. My point is, if you didn’t fuck about with other countries in the first place, many wars wouldn’t exist today (the palestine/israel one for example).</p>
<p>I am not a liberal, that’s just what your narrow minded american political system thinks, because you only have 2 sides. Sweden has terrible politics as well, sure, but at least we avoid wars, unlike some. We haven’t had a war in over a century and we have no major arguments with any country in the world.</p>
<p>How is it that we can so easily avoid conflict when you can’t?</p>

<p>So you prefer violence over reason and debate? Violence and aggression should be the last resort.

[/quote]<br>
No. Not aggression, just not giving up our weapons “hoping” the rest of the world will do the same. Peace and debate just doesnt work, it can’t work. Its not realistic and only a theory, world peace can never be achieved. We can try, but i dont see why we have to go get into other countries hair and try to be friends with them if we could just stand our ground and mind our own business here, “ready” for a fight if one were to happen. All of our allies are our allies because we either run on similar forms of government or we’re all for freedom. It has nothing to do with countries being scared of us.</p>
<p>We have never attacked another country on imperialism. All of our wars have 20+ years of background negotiation. However, countries that run on communism ‘need’ to conquer other countries to keep communism working. China and some other countries voided this by messing with their economy type.[/quote]I guess america doesn’t need allies - you can just nuke anyone who messes with you, right?</p>

No. Not aggression, just not giving up our weapons “hoping” the rest of the world will do the same. Peace and debate just doesnt work, it can’t work. Its not realistic and only a theory, world peace can never be achieved. We can try, but i dont see why we have to go get into other countries hair and try to be friends with them if we could just stand our ground and mind our own business here, “ready” for a fight if one were to happen. All of our allies are our allies because we either run on similar forms of government or we’re all for freedom. It has nothing to do with countries being scared of us.</p>
<p>We have never attacked another country on imperialism. All of our wars have 20+ years of background negotiation. However, countries that run on communism ‘need’ to conquer other countries to keep communism working. China and some other countries voided this by messing with their economy type.</p>

<p>It sounds like a bad system the UK has then if it is how you said.  Because the Prime minister (the leader of your country, correct?) is from the legislative branch, which means that one branch of government has more power than the others.  Here the president is elected completely separately of our representatives, and is part of the executive branch, with certain powers not related to the legislative branch.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t checked the system in UK, but in Norway it is similar (With one election for parliament, and not a separate for PM) and a member of parliament must leave the legislative branch if he/she wants to be prime minister. So there will be no problem with a PM with one feet in each house. The American Presidental election is most often a competition of using most money, so I don’t see why that is so much better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>About systems like ‘the winner takes all’: These systems have a few upsides and a downside. The upsides are that the majority agrees with the winner, forming a government doesn’t take long and there is no need to compromise. The downside is that the minority isn’t that minor. Theoretically you could have a result of 50.1% of the votes for the winner, and 49.9% for the loser. Especially when you have a two party system like in the US, the two parties will never agree. One day you will have to compromise, but then you get “it’s their idea so we say nay”. Everyone should have the ability to found a party, and every party should have a realistic chance to get at least one seat in parliament. In countries like the US and England you have to join an existing party to be elected, so the right to be elected in those countries is only theoretical.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Forming a dictatorship government is takes even less time and you have to make even less compromises. So why don’t we just give up democracy altogether on that basis?</p>
<p>You’ve completely missed out the major downside of first-past-the-post being riddled with wasted votes and where it forces you to elect your candidates and party at the same time. These things take away power from the people in an unacceptable manner.</p>
<p>You’d also missed out the complete lack of proportionality and the total disconnection from amount of votes to amount of power. In the UK the Labour government had 55% of the seats in parliament, yet they had 35% of the popular vote. The system is completely discredited and bordering on the undemocratic.</p>

<p>In the US at least, everyone does have the ability to found a party.  I could run for president of the USA under the moparisthebest party if I wanted to.  Many of our state and local representatives are neither republican or democrat, it’s just that, historically, all of our presidents have been from one of the two main parties.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s why I said you can be elected, just only theoretically. Of course you can found a party, and sure, you can run for office. But it’s naive to think that you can actually get a seat in parliament. Senators and congressmen are elected via the ‘the winner takes all’ system too, right? So if you are a member of the third party, you need at least 33% of the votes in a state to become senator/congressman. In a country like the Netherlands you only need 0.66% of the votes.</p>
