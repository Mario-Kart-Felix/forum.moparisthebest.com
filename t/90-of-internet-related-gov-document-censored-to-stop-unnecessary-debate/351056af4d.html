<p>It sounds like a bad system the UK has then if it is how you said.  Because the Prime minister (the leader of your country, correct?) is from the legislative branch, which means that one branch of government has more power than the others.  Here the president is elected completely separately of our representatives, and is part of the executive branch, with certain powers not related to the legislative branch.</p>

They point at the UK, saying that it barely took a week to form the new government. It seems that they don’t understand that the system in the UK means that they aren’t represented the way they should be.</p>

Who would you want protecting your back yard? Republican or a Democrat? The democrat will go door to door and try to make friends with everyone in the neighborhood (ww2, great britain and hitler trying to ‘negotiate’). While a republican will just stay and not get in anyones hair.</p>

<p>So you prefer violence over reason and debate? Violence and aggression should be the last resort. Such an attitude will work for a while, but I wouldn’t trust my allies if they were my allies because of my aggression. Once that ivory tower starts to crumble, everyone will have their sledgehammer in their hands.[/quote]<br>
No. Not aggression, just not giving up our weapons “hoping” the rest of the world will do the same. Peace and debate just doesnt work, it can’t work. Its not realistic and only a theory, world peace can never be achieved. We can try, but i dont see why we have to go get into other countries hair and try to be friends with them if we could just stand our ground and mind our own business here, “ready” for a fight if one were to happen. All of our allies are our allies because we either run on similar forms of government or we’re all for freedom. It has nothing to do with countries being scared of us.</p>
<p>We have never attacked another country on imperialism. All of our wars have 20+ years of background negotiation. However, countries that run on communism ‘need’ to conquer other countries to keep communism working. China and some other countries voided this by messing with their economy type.</p>

No. What about the soviets and Georgia, the wars in south America, Attacks on Israel, and drug cartels in Mexico. Not only that, but the rest of the world definitely is not ‘at peace’ with each other. <span class="bbcode-b">No war does not mean peace, only stalemate</span>.</p>
<p>But you know, you could care less about the rest of the world. Since you’re anti American you always gotta make yourself look like an ass. While were talking about anti Americans, give me some reasons why you dont like the US.</p>
<p>Of course, when 3000 Americans are killed unprovoked and we go to war you criticize it. But if 3000 Sweds were killed im willing to bet you would still criticize the war it brought. You have no fighting side, you’re just here to criticize everyone else.</p>

What the hell are you talking about? Obviously small little wars throughout the world does not mean world peace.</p>
<p>Thats not my only viewpoints, i said it doesnt MEAN peace. Russia doesnt like us, we have no problems with Russia. That is not ‘peace’. The US, Britain, and Australia etc are all at peace.</p>

Ok, so if your sister or mother was on vacation in Middle East, and she was captured and had her head cut off on camera, you still wouldnt want that kind of mindset terminated?

First of all, the chance of that happening is about as big as them getting shot in some state in USA. Secondly, that “mindset” is propaganda. You are in a war, war spawns propaganda and it always will, which results in people believing this bullshit (very much like yourself).</p>
<p>I agree, that is not realistic. My point is, if you didn’t fuck about with other countries in the first place, many wars wouldn’t exist today (the palestine/israel one for example).</p>
<p>I am not a liberal, that’s just what your narrow minded american political system thinks, because you only have 2 sides. Sweden has terrible politics as well, sure, but at least we avoid wars, unlike some. We haven’t had a war in over a century and we have no major arguments with any country in the world.</p>
<p>How is it that we can so easily avoid conflict when you can’t?</p>

Thanks for the laugh. 7 million of you, and 300 million of us, obviously we will have more problems. Your country cant even hold a valid army, so you rely on others to defend it. Your country itself has never fought a war in a while. You only avoid war because other countries intercept it. If those countrys werent there to defend you, your country wouldnt be here.</p>
<p>You’re unaware of the rest of the world, you dont know what goes on keeping your ass at peace.</p>

<p>Yea i sorta realized this, when i said ‘peace’ in my post a couple posts above, i didnt mean peace in general, i meant world peace this whole time.</p>

None, plain and simple.</p>
<p>Also, cool thing, you found a picture and some guy writing about a bunch of religious extremists.
