    <title>I need some help here</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-some-help-here/54523</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;ve gotten the hang of some of the game, except MY private server.
Any help is appreciated.

1. Okay, whenever I go onto my private server, whenever I kill something it just drops bones and sometimes dwarf remains. How do I edit their drops?

2. Also, whenever I try to use range or magic, it just uses melee, and all weapons hit in the same way. Also, I can hold shields with 2hed weapons. Whenever I wear D&#39;hide body my arms disapear. Can I undo these problems?

3. When I try to make objects, am I supposed to enter the coordinates for the object?

4. Whenever I spawn an NPC like a monster, it always drops bones (even if it is a lesser or somethin&#39;).

5. I&#39;ve tried to go to a few places like with ladders and dungeons, these do not work....

6. Also, I can&#39;t open doors or gates....

I notice a lot of these problems may always be there when you start a new server, but I really need help. I can&#39;t understand the code Java is written in.

Thanks for any help you can offer!  :)</description>

              <p>Ok well now let’s do something useful for people who may play on his server and can’t use no clip. I’ve been working with this a bit. I’m guessing you’ll have to individually identify each gate coordinate and object IDs, and make separate object commands.</p>
<p>For instance from P16V6 server, which in my opinion is probably one of the best coded, this is a snippet of code to make a door teleport you to certain coordinates</p>
<blockquote>if (objectID == 4467 &amp;&amp; (objectX == 2384) &amp;&amp; (objectY == 3134))
// Zamorak door 2
              {
 if (absX == 2384) {
                   teleportToX = 2385;
                   teleportToY = 3134;
              }
 if (absX == 2385) {
               teleportToX = 2384;
                   teleportToY = 3134;
              }
              }</blockquote>
<p>I’m no master at java, but using most servers search for that in the client.java, and add a seperate code underneath it, just copy that and paste underneath it. Don’t forget the closing brackets to seperate them, then simply edit to the doors coords that you are fixing, and where you want that object to teleport you, or teleport itself when click by a player. Make SURE you edit the OBJECT ID to the door/gate/entrance/stairs or whatever form of transportation you are using, otherwise you’ll change the Zamorak Door <span class="hashtag">#2</span>’s destination.</p>
<p>Essentially what it does, is in the game identifies the Zamorak Door # 2, And says if you open it on the right side, to teleport you 1 place further inside the door, and same for the left side. Hence the 1 point difference in X coords. Or rather moves the door over one place, which is why in most codes that use this, the door simply seems to slide away, or dissapear completely if the coordinates are wrong. It has Conditions and Variables which specifies where you end up after clicking the object. I know it’s confusing and i’m still figuring it out myself. but for the best I can offer have a look.</p>
