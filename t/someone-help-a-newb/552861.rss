    <title>Someone help a newb</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/someone-help-a-newb/552861</link>
    <description>I would really like to make a RSC server. I have been playing since 01 and I love the game. I have designed my dream server and I want to make it. PLEASE can someone point me in the right direction to getting started? I have been searching forums and google for hours and everything I find is extremely old. Can anyone help me out?
