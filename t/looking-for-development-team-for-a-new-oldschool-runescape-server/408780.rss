    <title>Looking for development team for a new Oldschool Runescape Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-development-team-for-a-new-oldschool-runescape-server/408780</link>
    <description>[center]Current server development team;
Me &amp; my good friend Chachie. We are looking for someone who knows how to program PI, someone who knows how to program web-based stuff &amp; someone who&#39;s good in clients.



(Please, before saying PI sucks, we have fixed the memleaks, dupes &amp; have started rewriting the skills. Please don&#39;t hate before you see the progress me &amp; chachie have done alone in only a few days using a blank PI server.)

Also, I am not a professional coder, but I do have a few years of Delta experience and roughly a year of PI experience. I also have a lifetime VPS which everyone in the development team will get access to. [/center]
