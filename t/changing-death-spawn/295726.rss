    <description>Okay, it was originally like Seers Village.. I changed to my new home, and now I want it back to Edgeville.. People don&#39;t really like the new home.. Where do I search? Don&#39;t say its under initialization packet in player.java because that&#39;s where you spawn when you login. Help would be appreciated, and I&#39;ll rep if I can..</description>
