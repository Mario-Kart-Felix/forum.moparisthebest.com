R.I.P~Tupac Shakur the best rapper ever.

He was an excellent Artist of the west. I mean he recorded alot of inspiration songs like Changes, Life goes on, Heaven aint hard to find, Thugz mansion, Me against the world, Dear mama, it keeps going on. It&#39;s a sad story how him and Biggie to good friends were killed by two rival gangs which it was Tupacs gang. The bloods. And Biggies gang. The crips where they were going to shoot each CEO Suge knight (death row records) and Puff Combs A.K.A Puff Daddy (Bad Boy Records) but they actually ended up killing each other. It&#39;s a sad timeline of Tupacs how everything went down to him once he reached 16 years old. Anyway here it is.

<p>I meant his songs arent that appealing to me. I like a fast beat but he always uses computer sounding tunes (like the 80/90s sound effects phil collins uses (thug life asked me…)) . I wouldn’t mind if he used real instruments. I’m not into 90s rap. But i have to admit song of his songs are brilliant. He is still the best rapper that I’ve heard though.</p>

<p>Well I thought it did. I consider meaningful would be like about how they love their wife/girlfriend/family or how they miss a dead friend or their struggle in life (but not just a rap saying he had to shoot people and hustle and now he’s rich as fuck).</p>
<p>Meaningful songs that I can think of at the moment:</p>
<p>Dear Mama - 2pac<br>
Family Business - Kanye West<br>
Imagine - Snoop Dogg Feat. Dr. Dre &amp; D’Angelo<br>
Live In The Sky - T.I.<br>
Hope - Twista</p>

Little Pac get schizophrenic and manage to damage all y’all<br>
I’ll talk about 'em and you don’t really want it<br>
Cause they’re cornered and I want 'em to jump up<br>
I’d rather say that we came to shut ‘em all down<br>
So quick to test bullet yes declare war<br>
Roll and I’ll blow when I get the gun for the murder mo’ horror<br>
For what the did it all pause for the cause and I<br>
Fin to pull a nine or pistol little nigga wit mine f</strong>k dem<br>
niggas it’s on<br>
All y’all fall Bizzy gettin bitches test me bless the floor<br>
In any attempt to arrest me stress me lord<br>
Looking at death with the last of my breath<br>
Follow follow my kids but don’t sin in my steps<br>
Yet the weapon is kept with the best of my secrets<br>
Deep in the leaves I’m alone nigga believe<br>
That I can see it if needed an if you really want me in<br>
Well let it be and get the greens and be runnnin up over<br>

and slug it out or do this like punks and punk it out<br>
pull your strap on me nigga and you better kill me thug life<br>

<p>I’ll probably be punished for hard livin blind to the facts<br>
Thugs is convicts in gods prison hand on the strap<br>
Praying to father please forgive me police be rushing when they<br>
see me<br>
I flaunted America’s most wanted live on TV life<br>
Pleasure and pain stuck in this game holler my name<br>
We all gone die we bleed through similar veins<br>
Please explain to me now don’t panic when my gun burst<br>
Heard the last jam nigga this ones worse<br>
My nigga bone held the chrome till I came home<br>
Thug Luv playas tell these bitch niggas bring it on<br>
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening<br>
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathing now<br>
Who you believe in hit the weed and breathe it’s a<br>
Cold ass the world niggas kill you in your sleep watch me<br>
Until they stop me bury murder me or drop me<br>
I got Thug Luv for my nationwide posse feel me</p>
<p>[Layzie]<br>
Little thug from the land nigga never ran<br>
Motherf<strong>kers out to get me they don’t understand<br>
It’s the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> nigga out with a nation of niggas<br>
Down to put in some work do some dirt<br>
F</strong>kin round with the band Bone Thugs N Harmony<br>
Follow down the road we stroll to meet karma<br>
Everything I do it seem to cause drama<br>
Ready for the war like a knight in my armor bomb ya<br>
So quick to test us nigga wanna crash me eat dust<br>
For the love of the lust niggas bustin on us<br>
Hit 'em up with he buck 12 gauge erupt it’s the Art Of War<br>
Putting niggas on the floor<br>
when I’m comin through the door bringin nothin but terror<br>
Causing much pain to the nigga that dared us<br>
trying to put a twist in this thugsta<br>
era Paired up with a nigga like Pac<br>
and a nigga like me gotta stay high<br>
Thug Luv till i die keep my prayer to the sky<br>
but I’m still in the hood smoke and fry<br>
So I beg the lord to save us all escapers of misery<br>
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries soldiers of the century</p>
<p>[Krayzie]<br>
Here to get it told my niggas to get the hell down<br>
Down with the dirt and we don’t f<strong>k around<br>
Buck a couple of rounds and if you’re passing through then hit<br>

And don’t get caught up in the crossfire nigga<br>
Artillery thick and you don’t want to get to f</strong>kin with this<br>

<p>And I know being gangsta is his style. But seriously most gangsta rappers have made at least one meaningful song. 21 Questions is an example but it’s his only meaningful song that I feel is actually about anything important.</p>

<p>50 Cent doesn’t need to shoot himself though he just needs to get better rhymes and stop being a lil snitch…</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="kff0twPh86I" data-youtube-title="2pac - Untouchables Trailer" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div></p>
<p>Wanna just change the title too 2pac ? :P[/quote]</p>
<p>These remixs annoy me so dam much. Eminem completely ruined all those songs on Loyal To The Game. It annoyed me so much. I mean there are unreleased songs and they could just release them in an album but no, all these rappers gotta get some publicity and remix his songs. Just release 'em because I wanna hear some songs the way 2pac wanted 'em to be released.</p>
