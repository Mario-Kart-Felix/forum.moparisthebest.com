    <description>[center][size=24pt]Eclipse-Rsps[/size][/center]
[size=8pt]As some of you may know, my last few releases have been apart of the Eclipse-Rsps PvP series. This version however will not be released to the public. I am going to put this online just to see how far it can go ( goal is to have 30 online at one time ). Yes this sounds like a simple goal but i will not be paying for hosting/advertisement. [/size]
[size=24pt]The Reason Why[/size]
[size=8pt]I am putting this server online because i see to many server&#39;s these days that are &quot;pk servers&quot;. Back in maybe 2009 or 2008 the deffinition of a pking server was that you PK for your items and that Player Killing was a big part of the server, but that doesnt mean spawn every item and the only thing you can do is PK. I have made the server based on Pking and Skilling for ECP Points. Everytime you level up in a skilling skill ( minning, cooking, fishing, woodcutting, ect. ) you gain 1 ECP. The rates on these skills are 2 though, so it should take fairly long to get a 99 skill. ( roughly 3 hours ). [/size]
[size=24pt]The Team Needed[/size]
[size=8pt]I will be needing
1.Website Developer 0/1
2.Hoster 1/1
~Application~
[code]How Old Are You?:
What time zone are you in?:
How long can you be on each day?:
Are you familiar with PI?:
(hoster) How long can you have the server online per day?:
(website Dev) How often can you update the site?:[/code][/size]</description>

<p>This is simply not true. Also:</p>
<ol>
<li>You aren’t paying for Domain/Hosting/V.P.S?</li>
<li>3 hours per 99 Skill?</li>
<li>ECP? Eclipse Points? I was hoping you’d do something original with a Point system instead of<br>
just doing what Soulsplit and other servers do.</li>

then you’re clearly not trying to go for a server that is going to stay up.<br>
If 3 hours is one 99, then in one night someone could almost be max combat on your server.</p>
