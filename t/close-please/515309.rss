              <p>Mate, I’m asking you to stop, I’m not saying your breaking the rules by continuing. Anyways, I told you, I know you are just helping (constructive criticism) but I also said it is not my main priority. Thank you for pointing it out, it will be cleaned when I have the opportunity to move to website again.</p>

You’re asking me to stop pointing out issues to avoid bad press towards you? If someone isn’t breaking any rules then they’re free to post on what they wish. If someone is using bad practice throughout their site then I’m going to point it out. If you want to avoid things like that then fix the issues :).</p>

              <p>Uhh, that website needs a major revamp. It’s full of deprecated code and I don’t really see the need in the changing backgrounds, if you’re going to include changing backgrounds you should add some form of fade or transition to make it more aesthetically pleasing. You’re also using tables for styling which is extremely bad practice; you should only use tables to display tabular data. You’re also using  tags which are also deprecated, use the margin: auto; or text-align: center; CSS properties instead.</p>
<p>I only scanned over the code so I may have missed more deprecated features and bad practices but those are the major ones I can find.</p>
