    <description>		~~MY PICTURE UPLOADING TUT~~
hello first of all I would like to say that i have made this tut all by my self with the help of www.imageshack.net. This tut has been done and made on windows XP version.

First of all u take ur picture by pressing a button called print screen sysrq on ur keyboard. Then go to a workable paint program and press ctrl+v and it should pop up on the paint window when that happens u may edit ur picture or save it. When u are done editing save ur picture in ur picture files.

When ur are doen saving go to this website Www.imageshack.net. When u get to img shack click on browse. Located here ------&gt; [img]http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/8558/browsevr4.png[/img].. When ur my computer&gt;my pictures pops up choose a picture and click ok. Then press on upload wait a couple minutes when that is finished u will be at a window with 4 diffrent kinds of urls on the top of the page. So scroll down and there will be 5 more diffrent kinds of urls copy the very bottom one where is says â€œ derect link to imageâ€ then go to a note pad of any kind and write this [code][img] ur image url gose here[/img][/code] then save it when u go to post ur image copy and paste that code 


Thank you for ur time and I hope u injoy my tut if u have any questions plz notify me at deablo101sk@hotmail.com.
