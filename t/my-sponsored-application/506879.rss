    <title>My sponsored application</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-sponsored-application/506879</link>
    <description>So I started bidding on my the bidding website and I didnt know I had to have an application up before the 1st. I have actually waited all through Feb. just to do this bidding I really hope that I do not have to wait another month to get my application approved. Please tell me if its possible to get my application approved after bidding. I will pay what I have added to the bid, unless it deleted it for some reason after i posted my application. Thank you very much.</description>

              <p>I cant even see the bidding list because of this message “Your sponsored server application has been received, but not yet reviewed, please be patient and allow at least 24-48 hours for review. Do not post another application.” can you please notify someone so i can place a higher bid if needed. Thank you this would be very nice of you.</p>

<p>I’ve never actually bid on a server so I’m not 100% sure, I think it displays a pay now option after bidding is finished though so as long as you visit <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/sponsbid.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/sponsbid.php</a> on the 10th and pay if you’re in the top 10 you should be fine <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I’m not staff so I don’t have any access to that side of that board, sorry. But yes, if your bid is still in the top 10 when voting closes you will be a gold sponsored server :).</p>
