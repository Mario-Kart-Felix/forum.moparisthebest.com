    <description>Hi. I just started working on a server, with a bit of Java background, but I have some trouble. I am using a source that has a Deltascape Client Base. I chose to use a starters Delta client, but the person who put it up made all of the outdoor ground snowey, and the mini map aswell. I understand that I should use something called &quot;Tom&#39;s Cache Editor&quot;. I just don&#39;t understand what to do with it. Also, how would I change the textures of local areas such as the floors of shops, banks, dungeons, etc.</description>
