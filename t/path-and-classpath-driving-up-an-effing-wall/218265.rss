    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/path-and-classpath-driving-up-an-effing-wall/218265</link>
    <description>Hello, i have set up my class path variable and it works just fine. However, this is not the case with the Path variable. I erase whats in the path variable and put in: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;     then i go to command prompt and type in &#39;javac&#39; and it works, but when i type in &#39;ipconfig&#39; it doesnt work. So then i set it back to normal and &#39;javac&#39; doesnt work but &#39;ipconfig&#39; does.
