    <title>Server Evolution?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-evolution/529420</link>
    <description>When I first joined the RSPS community several years ago, everyone preferred playing old school RuneScape. However, most of the private servers that are out today are almost identical to the new RuneScape. I thought that people wanted to play RuneScape Private Servers mostly because RuneScape was &#39;advancing&#39; the graphics and items, changing the game completely, etc. but now all the servers are somewhat doing the same. So, I&#39;m wondering why and how this happened, and if a different server base such as Delta could still be as successful as a Project Insanity server.</description>

              <p>I believe many people played private servers to show rebellion against a lot of the decisions that Jagex had made. I’m sure everyone understands that evolution is necessary for any game to grow, so the graphics have little to do with the many of the reasons players quit.</p>

[/quote]<br>
I don’t think that was the main reason at all.<br>
Private servers originally started before Runescape even started “advancing”.<br>
While it is true some people join RSPS is because of the oldschool feel, I would say there is no definite ‘main reason’ that people play RSPS.<br>
There are tons of other reasons; easy, free, and smaller community. Just to name a few.</p>
<p>But the second part of your post I agree with, servers are generally looking the same now. There are a few great looking projects out there, but overall the RSPS community (Warning: Opinions are coming) is lazy and likes to mooch off previous releases instead of taking the time to make it unique.<br>
Although I do admit it is hard to be unique these days with so much having already been done.</p>
<p>Anyways…that is my 2 cents. o.o[/quote]<br>
Said my fanboy. &lt;3</p>
<p>Just kidding man haha.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">OT:</span> Well, I started a server a while back called <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,567011.msg4121115.html#msg4121115" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">FroyoScape</a>. The goal was to be unique and original (our banner was <a href="http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/422261_187879541354824_575956742_n.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> (“Be Original”)). In that topic, I had explained about the ‘Server Evolution’.</p>
<p>[quote=“arham 4, post:1, topic:463520”]People seem to have lost the point in RSPS. Watch servers like Deathlypvpz, whose coders think they are the best.<br>
Who seem to have lost the point in RSPS.<br>
We all started from us trying to add new items, that was, in my opinion, the Old Stone Age, we just tried to add Dragon Claws, eventually we got it, bcp, we got it, but when it all happened, our trend looked upon older items again.<br>
And this cycle will continue.<br>
When we finally programmed all the new RS features (Hybrid PvP started this), it became the New Stone Age.<br>
However, we started to look upon our old items, the good feeling of successfully programming simple things.<br>
We thought to ourselves, “We made our RSPS just like RS! Now what? Uhh…”<br>
You just cannot think of anything due to you just copying RS.<br>
Same updates as RS.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">For the servers that think that new things are awesome and program them, tell me this.<br>
Why should we play your server whereas RS has the same features but with the full features. </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">We are fully benefiting from RS if we copy, whereas, we should use our own ideas. </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Andrew Gower wasn’t born with these ideas, he made them up.<br>
That’s how RS came to be.<br>
That’s the RS we know now and use to love.<br>
That’s the RS that got known world-wide and turned to a master piece by Jagex. </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">If they thought of there own ideas, we should. </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">We should make a new RS, a new RS with our own RSPS features.<br>
We should make anything our mind gravitates towards.<br>
We have the power in our brain’s creativity to make a world-wide known RSPS. </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Just only if we try. Do you think us programmers were made just to copy? No, we were made to build upon and make a better game.</span>[/quote]<br>
So thats still my thoughts till this day.</p>
<p>There are some notable developments out there. For example, my great friend’s server, <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,646713.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Enso</a>, and <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,647956.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Knights!</a>. There is also another one of my awesome friend’s server (it is also proclaimed to be THE MOST unique, and I really do agree), <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,539866.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Embattled</a> which is about to resume development.</p>
<p>We still do have hope, don’t lose it. Some people even tell me that <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,642510.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">my server</a> is unique in a way also.</p>
<p>Tons of options still left. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

I don’t think that the RSPS community is lazy; I think that most of the people who decide to make servers do not have any knowledge of Java, therefore not being able to make anything unique. That’s why the servers that are successful most likely have an owner who has a vast knowledge of Java, because they’re able to make something that is unique and different from all the other servers.</p>
