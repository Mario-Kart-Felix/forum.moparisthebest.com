<p>Introduction</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>allright, so i’ve come to notice that i have gathered a large collection of<br>
textfiles on how to rip off all sorts of machinery. So, i’ve decided to compile<br>
all of it together into this tutorial. I have personally tested each of these<br>
methods and they do work. some tricks may require some social engineering experience.<br>
so lets get started.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Payphones</li>
</ol>
<p>lets face it, they’re everywhere. and personally, i couldn’t be happier about that<br>
fact. if you know what you are doing, payphones can save you an ample sum of money.</p>
<p>2a. Free Calls</p>
<p>this is a fairly simple technique that works on some phones. somewhree on the<br>
phone there should be a number listed as the “repair and refund number”. call<br>
that number and tell them the phone dropped your call and didn’t return any change.<br>
they’ll ask you for a name and address, feel free to bullshit that (you might not<br>
want to though, we’ll get to that in a second). when they ask what number you were<br>
calling, give them the number you want to make a free call to. some companies will<br>
put through a free 3 minute call, but often times these are monitored.</p>
<p>2b. Money</p>
<p>so lets say you called the “repair and refund number” from section 2a. and the<br>
company doesn’t offer the free call? well, the alternative is the phone company sends<br>
a check for the amount of money you say you lost to the name and address you told them.<br>
(most phone companies notice if you do this more than once on the same payphone in a day,<br>
so don’t be a retard)</p>
<p>don’t feel like going through the trouble of cashing a $0.50 check? there are other ways<br>
to get money from payphones. for example, try stuffing a large wad of toilet paper into<br>
the coin return shute. (be sure not to block the door, as this will arouse suspicion.)<br>
now, wait for about a day (or less, depending on how often the payphone is used) and<br>
then go back to the payphone. reach into the shute and pull a bit of the toilet paper down.<br>
while holding the door open about half way, light the toilet paper on fire. any change that<br>
was returned should have stopped on top of the wad of toilet paper, and has now fallen down<br>
to the coin return. however, you should be careful as some payphone manufacturers have<br>
started putting a sharp point inside the coin return shutes to stick anyone who tries this.</p>
<p>the 100% guaranteed way to get change out of the payphone is to take the entire payphone to<br>
your home and mess around until you get into it. the locks on payphones are usually on the<br>
side or the top, while the lock in the front is to open the change box. pick the lock on<br>
the side and then insert a t-shaped piece of metal into the front lock and turn. try not<br>
to damage the phone itself so you can hook it up in your house (tutorial coming soon).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Postage</li>
</ol>
<p>there comes a time in everyones life when they have to leave the luxuries of<br>
electronic mail and send via the postal system. but postage is and expense<br>
you don’t really have to pay too much for.</p>
<p>mix 2 parts white school glue and one part water. fill out the envelope the<br>
normal way and put a stamp on it. then brush a light coat of the glue/water<br>
over the stamp. now send the letter. when the person recieves the letter, they<br>
just have to run the stamp under some water for a few seconds and the postal<br>
service mark will wash off. (this makes for free postage for THEM)</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Food &amp; Drink</li>
</ol>
<p>fast food restaurants. lets face it, we all eat at these shtiholes all the time. and little do<br>
we know that we can make ourselves fat without paying a dime.</p>
<p>4a. Food</p>
<p>in order to get some free food at a fast food place, the first step is to find out when the shifts<br>
change at that particular location. about an hour after the second shift starts, walk into the<br>
restaurant and ask to speak to the manager. when the manager walks up give them something like “hi, i’m<br>
Micheal Taurus. i believe you talked to my father earlier” then tell them that your father had phoned<br>
earlier because they had forgotten a sandwich in his order, and that you were here to pick up the sandwich.<br>
they’ll probably just give you the sandwich, and maybe something extra if you have a real good story.</p>
<p>4b. Drink</p>
<p>the first method is so simple i’m ashamed not everyone does it. first you order an ice water<br>
with your food. now, if this is the kind of restaurant where you pour your own soda, just<br>
fill the cup up with soda instead of water (most fast food employees couldn’t give two shits<br>
about you stealing a soda). however, some places still have the soda fountains located behind<br>
the counter. what can you do about that?</p>
<p>this trick is also very simple but you must use it either when there is more than one person<br>
working the register, or when the restaurant is farily busy. take the ice water you ordered back<br>
to your table and tear the bottom out of the cup. now go up with the empty cup and tell them that<br>
the cup had a hole in it and ask them for another soda. they’ll probably give it to you without a<br>
second thought.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Vending Machines</li>
</ol>
<p>a fairly simple method of getting money from vending machines is to use the stuffing method<br>
we discussed with payphones. however, this time, instead of using toilet paper, we’ll be using<br>
a piece of cardboard. simply stuff the cardboard up into the chute for the coine return and come<br>
back in a day or so and remove the cardboard. if successfull, you should have a fairly large<br>
sum of money. note, if there is a door of any sort to the coin return, make sure you don’t let it close<br>
or all your change will be stuck there and just mock you like the idiot you are.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Arcade Games</li>
</ol>
<p>i discovered this trick at my work while playing pinball. some older arcade games<br>
(this one was made in 1997) have a flaw that allows you to get a small amount of<br>
change out of them. first you need to locate the two buttons labeled ‘push for coin return’.<br>
if you can’t find those buttons, go kill yourself. now, push the button on the left in as<br>
far as it will go. while holding in the first one, push the right button down as far as it<br>
will go. if successfull, you should have about fifty cents. some machines will let you do<br>
this at least a good 10 times.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>so, there you have it. with some practice you should be able to pull these off without<br>
drawing too much attention to yourself. good luck!<br>
