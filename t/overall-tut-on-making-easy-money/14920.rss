1. Introduction

allright, so i&#39;ve come to notice that i have gathered a large collection of
textfiles on how to rip off all sorts of machinery. So, i&#39;ve decided to compile
all of it together into this tutorial. I have personally tested each of these
methods and they do work. some tricks may require some social engineering experience.
so lets get started.

2. Payphones

lets face it, they&#39;re everywhere. and personally, i couldn&#39;t be happier about that
fact. if you know what you are doing, payphones can save you an ample sum of money.

2a. Free Calls

this is a fairly simple technique that works on some phones. somewhree on the
phone there should be a number listed as the &quot;repair and refund number&quot;. call
that number and tell them the phone dropped your call and didn&#39;t return any change.
they&#39;ll ask you for a name and address, feel free to bullshit that (you might not
want to though, we&#39;ll get to that in a second). when they ask what number you were
calling, give them the number you want to make a free call to. some companies will
put through a free 3 minute call, but often times these are monitored.

2b. Money

so lets say you called the &quot;repair and refund number&quot; from section 2a. and the
company doesn&#39;t offer the free call? well, the alternative is the phone company sends
a check for the amount of money you say you lost to the name and address you told them.
(most phone companies notice if you do this more than once on the same payphone in a day,
so don&#39;t be a retard)

don&#39;t feel like going through the trouble of cashing a $0.50 check? there are other ways
to get money from payphones. for example, try stuffing a large wad of toilet paper into
the coin return shute. (be sure not to block the door, as this will arouse suspicion.)
now, wait for about a day (or less, depending on how often the payphone is used) and
then go back to the payphone. reach into the shute and pull a bit of the toilet paper down.
while holding the door open about half way, light the toilet paper on fire. any change that
was returned should have stopped on top of the wad of toilet paper, and has now fallen down
to the coin return. however, you should be careful as some payphone manufacturers have
started putting a sharp point inside the coin return shutes to stick anyone who tries this.

the 100% guaranteed way to get change out of the payphone is to take the entire payphone to
your home and mess around until you get into it. the locks on payphones are usually on the
side or the top, while the lock in the front is to open the change box. pick the lock on
the side and then insert a t-shaped piece of metal into the front lock and turn. try not
to damage the phone itself so you can hook it up in your house (tutorial coming soon).

3. Postage

there comes a time in everyones life when they have to leave the luxuries of
electronic mail and send via the postal system. but postage is and expense
you don&#39;t really have to pay too much for.

mix 2 parts white school glue and one part water. fill out the envelope the
normal way and put a stamp on it. then brush a light coat of the glue/water
over the stamp. now send the letter. when the person recieves the letter, they
just have to run the stamp under some water for a few seconds and the postal
service mark will wash off. (this makes for free postage for THEM)

4. Food &amp; Drink

fast food restaurants. lets face it, we all eat at these shtiholes all the time. and little do
we know that we can make ourselves fat without paying a dime.

4a. Food

in order to get some free food at a fast food place, the first step is to find out when the shifts
change at that particular location. about an hour after the second shift starts, walk into the
restaurant and ask to speak to the manager. when the manager walks up give them something like &quot;hi, i&#39;m
Micheal Taurus. i believe you talked to my father earlier&quot; then tell them that your father had phoned
earlier because they had forgotten a sandwich in his order, and that you were here to pick up the sandwich.
they&#39;ll probably just give you the sandwich, and maybe something extra if you have a real good story.

4b. Drink

the first method is so simple i&#39;m ashamed not everyone does it. first you order an ice water
with your food. now, if this is the kind of restaurant where you pour your own soda, just
fill the cup up with soda instead of water (most fast food employees couldn&#39;t give two shits
about you stealing a soda). however, some places still have the soda fountains located behind
the counter. what can you do about that?

this trick is also very simple but you must use it either when there is more than one person
working the register, or when the restaurant is farily busy. take the ice water you ordered back
to your table and tear the bottom out of the cup. now go up with the empty cup and tell them that
the cup had a hole in it and ask them for another soda. they&#39;ll probably give it to you without a
second thought.

5. Vending Machines

a fairly simple method of getting money from vending machines is to use the stuffing method
we discussed with payphones. however, this time, instead of using toilet paper, we&#39;ll be using
a piece of cardboard. simply stuff the cardboard up into the chute for the coine return and come
back in a day or so and remove the cardboard. if successfull, you should have a fairly large
sum of money. note, if there is a door of any sort to the coin return, make sure you don&#39;t let it close
or all your change will be stuck there and just mock you like the idiot you are.

6. Arcade Games

i discovered this trick at my work while playing pinball. some older arcade games
(this one was made in 1997) have a flaw that allows you to get a small amount of
change out of them. first you need to locate the two buttons labeled &#39;push for coin return&#39;.
if you can&#39;t find those buttons, go kill yourself. now, push the button on the left in as
far as it will go. while holding in the first one, push the right button down as far as it
will go. if successfull, you should have about fifty cents. some machines will let you do
this at least a good 10 times.

8. Conclusion

so, there you have it. with some practice you should be able to pull these off without
drawing too much attention to yourself. good luck!
