    <description>If you want to edit your account email and the security question, shouldn&#39;t there be a delay? About 3 weeks ago I got hacked

and I couldn&#39;t get it back for awhile because the hacker instantly changed my account details.</description>

<p>Yes, that’s why there’s an email that is registered to the account, but that email can be very easily changed, therefore making the chances of</p>
<p>getting your account back harder.<br>

Maybe a password change confirmation through Via email?[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes that would be good, comfirmation through the email you have. What about a delay for your security question?</p>
