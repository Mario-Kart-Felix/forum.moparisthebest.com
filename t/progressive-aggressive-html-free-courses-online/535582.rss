    <title>Progressive/Aggressive html free courses online?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/progressive-aggressive-html-free-courses-online/535582</link>
    <description>So I start a new job somewhat soon (part time) and it requires at least some html knowledge. It won&#39;t require like &quot;programmers expert&quot; style but it will require the basic stuff/knowing about CSS type of stuff. 

I already have some experience with html/css but is there any sites out there that give like free online courses or at least like tutorials for the progressive/aggressive user? 

I have always heard that w3school or whatever isn&#39;t exactly the best site to go by.</description>

              <p>I’ve explained the w3fools and w3schools debate a hundred and twenty seven thousand times. W3schools used to have an incredibly terrible and out of date ton of shitty information displayed, now they’ve really improved what they offer. For anyone looking for a basic description and small referencing it’s a really useful site, for larger projects you really should use the official documentation provided to make sure you limit the chances of running into an accumulation of error and making a giant ass fuck up.</p>
<p>Anyone who still religiously posts the w3fools link behind a w3schools link is a full scale idiot who more than likely does not understand anything they’re writing about and only posts it because it was the fashion to post it 4 years ago.</p>
<p>L&amp;P, I suggest you do in fact take a look at the w3schools site. I’ve also got a basic guide stickied in here, it’s pretty big but take a read through it.</p>

              <p>I said I know the link cause that’s where I originally learned from. If there is a more “accurate” and “proper” place to learn though I’d rather learn there considering this will be a state job I will heading to.</p>
<p>To clarify more the job will be in relation to 508 compliance with state and federal websites. I have the basics down as far as how to make a skeleton/basic website design. But there are some areas I know I can improve on.</p>
<p>none the less thanks for the comment(s)</p>

[/quote]^ this is exactly what I am referring tol. I have always heard bad things about w3schools that’s why i was asking if there was any other suggested site.[/quote]Why is it that you don’t look for yourself?  It gives you the basic jist that you require to start getting out on your own.  It’s simple, laid out easy as fuck.  Tell me where you go to get “at least some” knowledge of HTML/CSS.  You can even get started with databases, serverside scripting, and dynamic client content all from one website.  Again, don’t make that your home.  I learned most of my HTML/CSS from looking at examples.  The languages are very basic.  You just have to be able to think about what you want, and it can happen.</p>

              <p>So I start a new job somewhat soon (part time) and it requires at least some html knowledge. It won’t require like “programmers expert” style but it will require the basic stuff/knowing about CSS type of stuff.</p>
<p>I already have some experience with html/css but is there any sites out there that give like free online courses or at least like tutorials for the progressive/aggressive user?</p>
<p>I have always heard that w3school or whatever isn’t exactly the best site to go by.</p>
