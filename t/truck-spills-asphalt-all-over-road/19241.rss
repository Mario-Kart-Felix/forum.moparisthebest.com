&lt;blockquote&gt;STREET CLOSES AFTER TRAILER SPILLS LOAD OF LIQUID ASPHALT

By Ray King/OF THE COMMERCIAL STAFF
Thursday, October 19, 2006 8:21 AM CDT

A tractor-tanker truck carrying liquid asphalt lost part of its load Wednesday morning and forced the closing of a Pine Bluff street for several hours.

Wally Hunt, coordinator of the county Office of Emergency Services, said the trailer contained 5,000 gallons of liquid asphalt and some of it spilled onto Michigan Street, resulting in the street being closed while cleanup operations were under way.

Police Lt. Bob Rawlinson said the truck was on its way to Pine Bluff Sand and Gravel when its driver, Jeff Dumas, 41, of El Dorado, missed the turn off the Martha Mitchell Expressway onto Michigan Street, and tried to use a side street to turn around.

“As he was turning back north onto Michigan Street from Fourth Avenue, the liquid cargo trailer dropped its right rear wheels into a deep ditch, causing the rear of the trailer to come up off the ground approximately six feet,” Rawlinson said. “The trailer rolled partially over and came to rest against a railroad signal, blocking the railroad tracks.”

He said the double hulled tank was punctured during the accident, but the spill resulted from damage to discharge pipes, causing some of the hot asphalt to leak into the ditch and onto the street.

Sand and Gravel company employees mixed sand with the asphalt, then scraped it off the street with a large bucket loader before the trailer, owned by Growedyle of Enid, Okla., was pulled from the ditch.

Rawlinson said the driver of the truck was not injured and railroad officials were trying to determine if any damage had been done to the tracks or signal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
