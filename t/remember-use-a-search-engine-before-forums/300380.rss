    <description>Hello people of moparScape, I&#39;ve been noticing alot of people posting on &quot;How do I make a server&quot; &quot;My compiler won&#39;t work&quot; and I&#39;m getting sick of it. And obviously, They are in the wrong section, Or it&#39;s just common sense to go to a tutorial.

This topic was made just to notify you to use a search engine before you post. Remember people, Search Engines are your best friends.

People, Also would be a big help would be is to just use some common sense. I&#39;ve seen some of the most retarted posts is the help section, &quot;Where&#39;s the client.java &quot; or &quot;Error in my compiler&quot;. It shows you in the CMD box people, and if you put the error in the search engine, it will show you how to fix it.

I hope people appreciate me making in this, In which I think everyone is annoyed on this subject. If you this this is stupid, Please comment. If you thought this was a good idea, Please comment. Thanks.</description>

              <p>Thanks for your concern on the matter, but the best thing you can do is report those topics to us moderators. We’ll deal with it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you’d be surprised as to how many people <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> use the search bar nowadays. The problem isn’t that they use it, but that not everyone uses it. We can’t make everyone use it, so we just have to do the best we can.</p>
