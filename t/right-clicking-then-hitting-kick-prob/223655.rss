    <title>Right Clicking then Hitting Kick Prob</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/right-clicking-then-hitting-kick-prob/223655</link>
    <description>Ok, I know I was trying to had full follow.. Then a moderator had told me 
that he can&#39;t kick.. So I went on, i right clicked a person, and the &quot;Follow&quot;
took the spot of &quot;Kick&quot;. So i went into my files, I deleted everything i did with follow,
and then I restarted the server..
Now kick shows, [IMG]http://i33.tinypic.com/2wghchf.jpg[/img]

but, it doesn&#39;t do anything.. Anyone knows how to make it kick the person?</description>
