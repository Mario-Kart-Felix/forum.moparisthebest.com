    <description>[CENTER][IMG]http://i700.photobucket.com/albums/ww4/primadude12/iClarity.png[/img]

Welcome to iClarity.

iClarity is back - better than before. iClarity was a PKing-based Runescape private server which I hosted for a short period, and then begun to release in versions. Now, I am going to put most of my spare time into this (apart from CoD4 gaming), however, I have school and homework etc so I won&#39;t have as much free time as I did during the Summer.

Over the past two months, those in which I have been in-active (Not been creating a private server), I have learnt a great deal more about the Java language. I have been focussing on certain aspects; one of which was UI&#39;s.
So far, I have been working on this for a week, and this time, I plan to get a lot more done. Last time, I focussed mainly on the PKing and combat-based aspects, but this time, I plan to focus a lot more on other features such as skills, minigmes and quests. Combat will still play a big role in the server.

This time I plan to host this, and not release it, however, it will probably end up being released anyway.

[size=12pt][B][U]What is this server based off?[/U][/B][/size]

This is based off iClarity V1.05, though, I am going to totally re-write almost every feature of iClarity, as they were shit. This time, I plan to get stability at it&#39;s optimum position before I begin creating any big in-game feature such as a minigame etc.


[size=12pt][B][U]What will the server contain?[/U][/B][/size]

iClarity is going to be a full-world based private server. All features, aspects, npcs, minigames and quests are going to be spread across almost the full Gielinor world. I plan to re-write the previously made minigames such as duel-arena, fight cave and barrows. Other new minigames will also be created. iClarity will also include high-level monsters from which you can gain rare drops from. These include the dragon chain from the kalphite queen etc. The server will have a optimum economy.

[size=12pt][B][U]Feature log[/U][/B][/size]

[B]12th October[/B]
- Combat is now working, however the delays in-between attacks aren&#39;t working yet.

[B]11th October[/B]
Sorry for 7 days of no updates; I have been busy IRL.

- Melee max hit calculation is now [b][i]Perfect[/i][/b].
- Combat has been worked on a little bit.
- New saving method tested and it works (Saves when client is closed, player disconnects, an exception is thrown, or the player logs out).
- Fixed a bug - when you equipped a shield when you had a two-handed weapon equipped, an exception was thrown.

[B]4th October[/B]
- Characters do not save every 5 seconds now; they save every 5 minutes. However, when you disconnect, logout, or get updated, your character will be saved. This is much more efficient.
- The skill of Runecrafting is beginning to be written.

[B]2nd October[/B]
- Started to re-write combat; no timers are being used this time.
- The logging in glitch where you get a black screen is FIXED.

[B]1st October:[/B]
- Completely removed PvP combat and magic. Weapon speeds, and weapon animations are now contained in 2D arrays rather than within switch-statements.
- Skill &#39;timers&#39; such as fishing and cooking now use events instead of processing. The same will apply to the combat &#39;timers&#39; when I re-add and re-write combat.
- Server has been re-packaged slightly.

[B]30th September[/B]:
- Frames are now situated in a separate class, and methods and parameters, renamed. To call them the server uses a singleton to avoid the frame methods being static.
- Commands are now managed via an interface (One child class per command) and the amount of commands there are have been reduced greatly.

[B]29th September[/B]:
- The way in-coming connections are handled have been re-written.
- The server only allows one connection per IP using an arraylist to contain the current-connections.


Thanks, Primadude.[/CENTER]</description>

<p>Welcome to iClarity.</p>
<p>iClarity is back - better than before. iClarity was a PKing-based Runescape private server which I hosted for a short period, and then begun to release in versions. Now, I am going to put most of my spare time into this (apart from CoD4 gaming), however, I have school and homework etc so I won’t have as much free time as I did during the Summer.</p>
<p>Over the past two months, those in which I have been in-active (Not been creating a private server), I have learnt a great deal more about the Java language. I have been focussing on certain aspects; one of which was UI’s.<br>
So far, I have been working on this for a week, and this time, I plan to get a lot more done. Last time, I focussed mainly on the PKing and combat-based aspects, but this time, I plan to focus a lot more on other features such as skills, minigmes and quests. Combat will still play a big role in the server.</p>
<p>This time I plan to host this, and not release it, however, it will probably end up being released anyway.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">What is this server based off?</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>This is based off iClarity V1.05, though, I am going to totally re-write almost every feature of iClarity, as they were shit. This time, I plan to get stability at it’s optimum position before I begin creating any big in-game feature such as a minigame etc.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">What will the server contain?</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>iClarity is going to be a full-world based private server. All features, aspects, npcs, minigames and quests are going to be spread across almost the full Gielinor world. I plan to re-write the previously made minigames such as duel-arena, fight cave and barrows. Other new minigames will also be created. iClarity will also include high-level monsters from which you can gain rare drops from. These include the dragon chain from the kalphite queen etc. The server will have a optimum economy.</p>

<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Feature log</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">12th October</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Combat is now working, however the delays in-between attacks aren’t working yet.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">11th October</span><br>
Sorry for 7 days of no updates; I have been busy IRL.</p>
<ul>
<li>Melee max hit calculation is now <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Perfect</span></span>.</li>
<li>Combat has been worked on a little bit.</li>
<li>New saving method tested and it works (Saves when client is closed, player disconnects, an exception is thrown, or the player logs out).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug - when you equipped a shield when you had a two-handed weapon equipped, an exception was thrown.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4th October</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Characters do not save every 5 seconds now; they save every 5 minutes. However, when you disconnect, logout, or get updated, your character will be saved. This is much more efficient.</li>
<li>The skill of Runecrafting is beginning to be written.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2nd October</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Started to re-write combat; no timers are being used this time.</li>
<li>The logging in glitch where you get a black screen is FIXED.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1st October:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Completely removed PvP combat and magic. Weapon speeds, and weapon animations are now contained in 2D arrays rather than within switch-statements.</li>
<li>Skill ‘timers’ such as fishing and cooking now use events instead of processing. The same will apply to the combat ‘timers’ when I re-add and re-write combat.</li>
<li>Server has been re-packaged slightly.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">30th September</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frames are now situated in a separate class, and methods and parameters, renamed. To call them the server uses a singleton to avoid the frame methods being static.</li>
<li>Commands are now managed via an interface (One child class per command) and the amount of commands there are have been reduced greatly.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">29th September</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way in-coming connections are handled have been re-written.</li>
<li>The server only allows one connection per IP using an arraylist to contain the current-connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, Primadude.[/CENTER]</p>
