    <title>Wilderness Help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wilderness-help/359584</link>
    <description>Okay, I am curently trying to make it so that all the areas of my server are non-wilderness except for the wilderness itself. Obviously to prevent people from pking in my home area, shopping area etc. Is this possible?
Example: Falador, Varrock, Edgeville, Ardougne, Lumbridge, Catherby etc. are non-wilderness and the wilderness remains the wilderness.

Additional Info: I am using a blank source and it is a 317 server.
More Info: Not sure whether this may help or not but my home area is at edgeville bank.

Thanks for reading, hope you can help.   :confused:
I figured it out now.....i took the coordinates from another source.</description>
