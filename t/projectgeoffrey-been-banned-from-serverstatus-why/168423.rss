THE REASON I WAS BANNED..

[b]Project Geoffrey!!
What can i say bout this server?

&quot;well if you get 20m and 105 combat level.
(in the server) 
you can buy member.&quot;

I MEANT IN MY SERVER, IF YOU GET 20M AND 105 COMBAT YOU CAN BUY MEMBERSHIP WITH &quot;MOPAR MONEY&quot;
NOT RUNESCAPE.

WHO EVER PLAYED THIS SERVER POST SAY I DONT SELL IT FOR RS GOLD!!

How Can i make money?

If You go straight down the stars past the guards you will see a Frog Princess go into her portal to kill torags and barbarians to get Red phats and other items! sell the red phats at the shop for 5m!
