              <p>OK WELL THIS COULD BE THE PROBLEM DID U COMPLIE? IF U DID, DID IT GIVE U ANY ERROR? DID IT SAY PATH CANNOT BE SPECIFIED OR SOMETHING? IF SO THAT IS THE REASON. IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE IT COULD JUST BE THAT THE SERVER U ARE USING IS NOT SUPPOSE TO BE CHANGED.</p>

              <p>Please be more specific in describing your problems. They’re very vague and you don’t give us enough information. Which Revision are you using as a Base? Do you know if your Java Compiler is functioning correctly? Are you updating the correct files? etc.</p>

              <p>When you compile, does it sit there blank for a moment, and then say click to continue, or does it say the path can’t be specified or something like that? If you does say it can’t be found, then you need to edit the compiler to your java location. If you need help, add and message me on Skype.  iamjmperry</p>
