Since when have you been able to do anything yourself?<br>
EDIT: RSCEmulation more advanced than their server? Lol, RSCE is getting updated like once a year with useless, non-content features. I have seen more progress from RSCR in 2 weeks.<br>
And to be honest, RSCR is more of runescape classic “emulation” than RSCE will ever be.</p>

since i look at how other do it and learn from it. I did state i may need help with website like character mangement, but if i look around there is probably one someone has released.</p>
<p>as far as the argument that this other server it has only been up for a couple weeks and they are not anywhere near rsce content.  What more can they have then rsce???  this other server looks like it has alot of potential don’t get me wrong but it will not last as you will see in the future.</p>
<p>On topic:<br>
Players of runescape classic don’t want all this shit anyways… Players that are left in the scene just wana pk and stake…minimal skilling players left… This game is dead besides these 2 things… Lets throw it up and there will be 30+ online… Which is way better than some other Server trying to replicate what RSCE has already done!</p>
