    <description>sup guys im posting here to be truthful.  

I like RSC and when kingpk came back for the little while people were on playing THIS is the most FUN I&#39;ve had since the real runescape classic. Anyone wanna bring it back with me?  This is the only hope (besides rsce which has players) for a fun runescape classic memory and to have FUN.</description>

<p>hello have you seen rscemulation, they have been alive way longer than you and far more advanced then you.  If i wanted to play a server where most things are replicated i would play rscemulation… as you will see you will gain players but not that many will play your server.<br>
On topic:<br>
Whos with me if not then I will do it myself, i may just need help with the website side of things.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Since when have you been able to do anything yourself?<br>
EDIT: RSCEmulation more advanced than their server? Lol, RSCE is getting updated like once a year with useless, non-content features. I have seen more progress from RSCR in 2 weeks.[/quote]<br>
since i look at how other do it and learn from it. I did state i may need help with website like character mangement, but if i look around there is probably one someone has released.</p>
<p>as far as the argument that this other server it has only been up for a couple weeks and they are not anywhere near rsce content.  What more can they have then rsce???  this other server looks like it has alot of potential don’t get me wrong but it will not last as you will see in the future.</p>
<p>On topic:<br>
Players of runescape classic don’t want all this shit anyways… Players that are left in the scene just wana pk and stake…minimal skilling players left… This game is dead besides these 2 things… Lets throw it up and there will be 30+ online… Which is way better than some other Server trying to replicate what RSCE has already done!</p>

And to be honest, RSCR is more of runescape classic “emulation” than RSCE will ever be.</p>
