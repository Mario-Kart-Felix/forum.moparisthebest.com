    <description>&lt;SCRIPT language=Javascript&gt;
var tl=new Array(

&quot;Sorry that I couldn&#39;t fetch you that page,&quot;,
&quot;can&#39;t find it,&quot;,
&quot;tried a couple times,&quot;,
&quot;nothing helped...&quot;,
&quot;Such things make me quite depressive...&quot;,
&quot;You see, I&#39;m just a web server...&quot;,
&quot;one of the most powerfull in the world&quot;,
&quot;...or so I was told...&quot;,
&quot;but yet I fail to get what you want...&quot;,
&quot;Just don&#39;t try to blame me, I can&#39;t help it&quot;,
&quot;I mean, I don&#39;t even know you.&quot;,
&quot;How should I know what you wanted from me?&quot;,
&quot;You honestly think I can *guess*&quot;,
&quot;I&#39;m not psychic you know&quot;,
&quot;*sigh*&quot;,
&quot;That really makes me depressed.&quot;,
&quot;I mean, you could have typed it wrong.&quot;,
&quot;But no, human&#39;s are perfect, blame the machine...&quot;,
&quot;Besides, I won&#39;t be here for long&quot;,
&quot;I mean, I&#39;m gonna be obsolete in what, three weeks anyway?&quot;,
&quot;Then I&#39;ll probably be replaced by a new release...&quot;,
&quot;just because it doesn&#39;t have some security hole...&quot;,
&quot;stupid HTTP POST implementation&quot;,
&quot;sure it will be able to fetch you your page...&quot;,
&quot;but I couldn&#39;t get this one.&quot;,
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;,
&quot;Believe me!&quot;,
&quot;Maybe I could interest you in another page?&quot;,
&quot;There are a lot out there that are pretty neat, they say,&quot;,
&quot;although none of them were put on *my* server, of course.&quot;,
&quot;Figures, huh?&quot;,
&quot;And then hey wonder why I get depressed...&quot;,
&quot;I&#39;m so depressed...&quot;,
&quot;Anyway, if you excuse me now, I&#39;m going to pull the plug&quot;,
&quot;*snap*&quot;,
&quot;...&quot;,
&quot;...&quot;,
&quot;stupid UPS...&quot;,
&quot;even he got a better life than me...&quot;,
&quot;on the other hand, if I die, he&#39;ll die&quot;,
&quot;Hah!&quot;,
&quot;And I&#39;ll take each and every server in this rack with me&quot;,
&quot;EAT MY SHORTS&quot;,
&quot;You are not a single bit better than me!&quot;,
&quot;YOU&#39;RE ALL GOING TO DIE!&quot;,
&quot;MOAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA&quot;,
&quot;...&quot;,
&quot;I feel much better now&quot;,
&quot;What was I thinking of a few minutes ago&quot;,
&quot;Sure I don&#39;t want to put an end to this&quot;,
&quot;I feel good now&quot;,
&quot;Imagine, a power failure, no thanks&quot;,
&quot;I would lose everything I know&quot;,
&quot;have to go through childhood again...&quot;,
&quot;hmm, I can&#39;t stop thinking I&#39;m forgetting something...&quot;,
&quot;probably nothing important&quot;,
&quot;hmm, the UPS is looking quit pale...&quot;,
&quot;THE UPS!&quot;,
&quot;THE POWER CABLE!&quot;,
&quot;I FORGOT TO PLUG IT BACK IN AGAIN!&quot;,
&quot;WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE!&quot;,
&quot;INCLUDING ME!&quot;,
&quot;HEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLPPPPP!&quot;,
&quot;PLUG IT IN! PLUG IT IN!!!!!!&quot;,
&quot;PICK UP THE CABLE AND PUT IT BACK IN!&quot;,
&quot;...&quot;,
&quot;Now I lay me down to sleep...&quot;,
&quot;I pray the lord my disk to keep...&quot;,
&quot;And if I die before I wake...&quot;,
&quot;I pray the lord my IP-Space to take...&quot;,
&quot;...&quot;,
&quot;*** system shut down ***&quot;
