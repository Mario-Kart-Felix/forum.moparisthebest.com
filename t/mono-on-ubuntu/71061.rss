    <title>Mono On Ubuntu</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mono-on-ubuntu/71061</link>
    <description>If anyone knows what Mono is (not Mononucleosis) and has tried it, does it work well on Ubuntu? I will be installing it on my new computer, so if anyone knows...I&#39;ve used it with SuSE Linux 10.0 before, and it works on that platform. Also, does anyone know how to run Moparscape on Linux? I&#39;ve tried running the shell script from 3.2, but the windows pops up for a sec, then disappears. If anyone has got it working, please tell me. I think the reason it doesn&#39;t work is because it was compiled on a windows platform, and needs to be re-compiled on a Linux platform, but I&#39;m not sure.
Thanks.</description>
