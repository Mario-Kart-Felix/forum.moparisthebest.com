        <p>Hey everybody so I am from the U.S, and on the news it is always showing how this or that state increased their minimum wage significantly! Is it that simple? Will that fix our economy?? Here is my problem/case about this.</p>
<p>We will use <span class="bbcode-b">gas</span> as an example.</p>
<p>Lets say Gas is 2.00$ a gallon.</p>
<p>Now businesses have to watch and record how much gas is being bought by each customer. If gas prices are to <span class="bbcode-b">high</span> then that would make it so less people bought gas because who wants to buy over-priced gas? Which would make the industries have to much product because no one is buying their gas.</p>
<p>And if gas prices are <span class="bbcode-b">super cheap </span>then everybody would buy large quantities of gas which would make companies supply of gas go down! Because everyone is buying/taking their gas.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Now lets say gas had to stay permanently at 2.00$ and the price can never rise or fall for this example.</span></p>
<p>Now lets say all of the states raised their minimum wage to 15$! WOOHOO MORE MONEY FOR US!</p>
<p>How will that effect the gas companies? If everyone has way more money? well then 2.00$ a gallon for gas is super easy to buy because we have more money so people can buy more and more and more gas! Well then the companies would eventually run out of gas because people can take so much of it constantly because gas is super cheap to us because we all got raises.</p>
<p>So now that we know if prices stayed low and we got higher wages then companies would run out of product. So companies are always forced to raise or lower their prices of gas to match how much we get paid. So if all states really do become 15$ an hour then companies have to match that and raise their prices for their product. and would Make gas like 7.00$ a gallon. But the problem with that is you are still getting the same amount of gas for your buck.</p>
<p>So how is it that any different having a 15$ minimum wage if companies have to raise their prices along with you. It will still counter balance like how it did before you got a higher minimum wage right?</p>
<p>Lets say everyone in the world lost all of their money and had to start from scratch. But companies kept their prices the same. So gas is still 4.00$ a gallon. What will happen to the price for gas? It will drop significantly because no one has money to buy their gas.</p>
<p>My point is it does not matter if we all get paid more or less right? It really is mostly on the companies side and their prices. Not how much we get paid. I feel like increasing minimum wage is pointless. Prices will just go up as well so we are still getting the same amount for our buck as we did for when we made 7.50$ an hour.</p>
<p>And that is what the goal is right? We want more stuff for our buck. That’s why people like all you can eat restaurants. You get more food for your dollar rather then going to a high priced place and get little-to-no food.</p>
<p>So how do people get more stuff for their buck? would all companies just have to hold hands together and keep their costs for their product always super low?</p>
<p>I would love to hear what you guys think. Economy just makes me go cross-eyed but that is how I see it all. What do you guys think? If any part was confusing let me know and I will try to clear it up. Economics can be pretty confusing so I will do the best I can to answer any questions.</p>

2. This is not a problem in places in US where they have increased the minimum wage.[/quote]</p>
<p>And that is where it is a bad thing. If minimum wage is increased prices will go up. But people who make more then minimum do not get a increase so they are just stuck with higher priced products.</p>
<p>If I make 27$ an hour and minimum wage is increased significantly which makes prices go up higher as well. I am screwed as a consumer and my dollar does not get me as much for my buck. For one hour of work I get 27 dollars and with that 27$ I can normally buy half a tank of gas. And if prices of gas go up because of minimum wage now I can only get a third of my gas tank filled. See how that is a problem? And if prices goes up then people who make 15$ an hour will still get the same amount of product as they did before because gas is more expensive. Except they will screw over people who make more then that in the process</p>
<p>And it is starting to become a problem in the U.S because states are trying to force minimum wage to increase. I heard the other day how Washington is trying to make their minimum wage to 15$ an hour</p>

        <p>Definitely valid points, but you’re oversimplifing it - the price of every product in the economy does not correlate with what minimum wage employees earn. Even if that were the case, there’s still a short term benefit of the increase in buying power. From this perspective it has the same pros/cons as inflation.</p>
<p>I think the real problem with raising minimum wage is that small businesses just can’t afford it, so you end up with more unemployment and more people on zero hour contracts. People who think the same minimum-wage employees are going to keep the same jobs and get a pay rise are deluded.</p>
<p>Maybe the logic is this - we raise the minimum wage so that burger flippers are paid more. McDonalds have to increase the price of a burger, and so do all the other fast food restaurants because they have to pay the same. Everyone on a high wage is still earning the same amount, but their burgers cost more - shifting wealth from the “rich” to the “poor”. The high wage employees aren’t going to demand pay rises because of the rise in the cost of a burger, so you don’t get widespread inflation.</p>

An increased minimum wage would in no way have that much of an impact on gas prices.</p>

This is just false. Unemployment have no increased places where the minimum wage has increased.

<li>Your logic fails at one important point, not everyone gets more money with an increase in minimum wage. Those with good wages would not get a wage increase. And if they get an increase it will be minimal and mostly due to the economy improving.</li>
<li>This is not a problem in places in US where they have increased the minimum wage.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And that is where it is a bad thing. If minimum wage is increased prices will go up. But people who make more then minimum do not get a increase so they are just stuck with higher priced products.</p>
<p>If I make 27$ an hour and minimum wage is increased significantly which makes prices go up higher as well. I am screwed as a consumer and my dollar does not get me as much for my buck. For one hour of work I get 27 dollars and with that 27$ I can normally buy half a tank of gas. And if prices of gas go up because of minimum wage now I can only get a third of my gas tank filled. See how that is a problem? And if prices goes up then people who make 15$ an hour will still get the same amount of product as they did before because gas is more expensive. Except they will screw over people who make more then that in the process</p>
<p>And it is starting to become a problem in the U.S because states are trying to force minimum wage to increase. I heard the other day how Washington is trying to make their minimum wage to 15$ an hour<br>

An increased minimum wage would in no way have that much of an impact on gas prices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the real problem with raising minimum wage is that small businesses just can’t afford it, so you end up with more unemployment and more people on zero hour contracts. People who think the same minimum-wage employees are going to keep the same jobs and get a pay rise are deluded.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is just false. Unemployment have no increased places where the minimum wage has increased.[/quote]</p>
<p>Gas prices was only an example. Prices would go up not that dramatically but they would. (If) Minimum Wage Nationally was increased.</p>
<p>And Justin Bieber was right. If you own a business Bowser (Brand New) You can really only afford paying employees minimum wage. If minimum wage goes up you have to pay them extra. How are you going to afford to pay them that extra?</p>
<p>1)You lay off workers (Unemployment)<br>
or<br>
2)You raise the prices in your shop so you make more money so you can afford paying their new raised salary’s.</p>
<p>So either prices will go up or Bieber is right. There will be a rise of unemployment because the small businesses would not make profit.</p>
<p>But he was right I did oversimplify it.</p>

<p>That is when the second half of my post comes in. If we have all of this money then the cost/worth of the dollar actually goes down. It’s like Runescape if everyone has max amount of gold on their accounts. The price of gold actually goes down.  Rare items like ags’s and bgs’s or dragon claws are not going to stay at the price they are at right now. The costs of those items are going to skyrocket big time! Because that is how it works in economics.The More money people have the costs go up as well. Because if someone has max cash and you worked super hard for your ags are you still only going to sell it for like 100m? 100m is junk change because everyone has billions of gold now. You are going to want 800m for it. And that is the problem with Rsps’s even. People can make so much money really quick. Each time you thieve from a stall you get 100k gold. After an hour you have like 8 billion gold. Are dragon claws going to stay at 25m like they used to be? Heck no! Because they are rare and you can make 25m in a heart beat. The price for dragon claws are now 5.5b!</p>
<p>See how it works like that?</p>
<p>I wish your reality was true. Let us give everyone tons of money and the prices stay the same and everyone can have a job and woohoo! But it does not work like that. If it was that easy don’t you think gas or a gallon of milk or a home would be dirt cheap like how it was in the 1800’s? Why is it so different now? Because people have way more money now! Cant just give people tons of money and say have fun. If that was the case I could take 1000 dollars and get 100+ acres of land. But 1000 dollars can barely get you a car these days. Because money is not worth the same as it was before.</p>

        <p>My reality is the reality. This isn’t some wishful thinking, it actually works. Everything you import is going to stay the same price, and you’re not increasing the total amount of dollars, just changing how it circulate.</p>
<p>The RS economy is not a viable comparison, as it has no monetary policies controlling the value of it’s gold, and it has no control over minting gold coins.</p>

        <p>The effect of government wage controls, specifically on the minimum wage allowed, is actually basic economics. There isn’t a real question as far as I know. It’s been very well described by many economists, many times.</p>
<blockquote>The minimum wage law is most properly described as a law saying that employers must discriminate against people who have low skills. That’s what the law says. The law says that here’s a man who has a skill that would justify a wage of $5 or $6 per hour (adjusted for today), but you may not employ him, it’s illegal, because if you employ him you must pay him $9 per hour. So what’s the result?  To employ him at $9 per hour is to engage in charity. There’s nothing wrong with charity. But most employers are not in the position to engage in that kind of charity. Thus, the consequences of minimum wage laws have been almost wholly bad. We have increased unemployment and increased poverty.
<p>Moreover, the effects have been concentrated on the groups that the do-gooders would most like to help. The people who have been hurt most by the minimum wage laws are the blacks. I have often said that the most anti-black law on the books of this land is the minimum wage law.</p>

        <p>I don’t know about bait. I mean, I like Freidman but I haven’t really taken any real in-depth economics courses, so I’m not sure if he’s been discredited by the establishment or what-not. From what I’ve read, it seems pretty clear that government regulation has specific, documented effects on different industries and sectors. And, in this case, it’s a well researched and documented that increasing the minimum wage is going to cause the economy to shed jobs, and is going to cause general instability and loss of productivity.</p>
<blockquote>As a jobs program, raising the minimum wage is a real loser.  Congress raised the minimum wage 10.6% in July, 2009 (know of anyone else getting a raise then?).  In the ensuring 6 months, nearly 600,000 teen jobs disappeared, even with nearly 4% growth in the economy, this compared to a loss of 250,000 jobs in the first half of the year as GDP growth declined by 4%  Why?  When you raise the price of anything, people take less of it, including labor.  The unemployment rate for teens remains unacceptably high.   Workers of all ages that are relatively unskilled are adversely impacted by this policy.</blockquote>
<p>When you raise prices on a commodity (labor) then consumers (employers, in this case) have less purchasing power. I would challenge you to explain how this is not the case.</p>

It is in Norwegian, but look at figure 7.1 showing the yearly increase in real wage each year in Norway. If you’re right, there should no yearly increase in real wage as any rise should also increase the price of commodities.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure raising the minimum wage necessarily increases the price of commodities, though we can discuss that issue as well. My thesis is simply that less people will be hired when the minimum wage is raised, since businesses cannot afford to hire people at a wage which they are not worth.</p>
<p>I did use google translate to check that article out, but I am still having trouble deciphering it. Let’s assume that your analysis is right, then, and the real wage is increasing along with the actual wage. This doesn’t disprove the thesis that  less people will be hired, since businesses cannot afford to hire people at a wage which they are not worth. Now, Norway has no minimum wage. They have tariffs, which defines workers rights and payment. They are negotiated every two years between unions and corporations.</p>
<p>Now here’s two very good arguments <span class="bbcode-b">for</span> the minimum wage (Source: <a href="http://squashed.tumblr.com/post/51658308085/labor-economics" rel="nofollow noopener">http://squashed.tumblr.com/post/51658308085/labor-economics</a> )</p>
<blockquote>The next oasis we reach has the opposite problem. Specifically, this oasis contains a number of olive growers. Due to the peculiar weather, there has been a bumper crop of olives. Olives are falling off the trees, rotting on the ground. Due to the extreme supply, there has been a race to the bottom on pricing. The market price for olives is now below the cost of production—at least for this year.
Olive trees require water and care—which means that the market price is about to result in a lot of dead olive trees. That’s not a problem this year—but it takes at least three years to get an olive tree producing. Absent some intervention, so this one year anomaly is going to screw up the market for the forseeable future. In certain situations where there is an extreme surplus, a market intervention is prudent to preserve capacity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A business with a company car pays for car insurance, repairs, routine maintenance, and whatever other licensing or taxes that go into the cost of owning and operating a car. There may be ways to do this more efficiently or effectively, but at some point there is a minimum amount you need to pay to operate a business with a car.
Why should an employee be treated worse than the company car? Employees need to eat, be sheltered, have medical care, plan for retirement, and generally have lives. If you pay your employees less than some minimal cost of living, you’re asking somebody else to subsidize your business.7 That is not a free and fair market. That is business socializing costs for private profit.</blockquote>
<p>So we can see, in these examples, it seems like you need to have a minimum wage in order to avoid corporations taking advantage of the common man. It’s <span class="bbcode-b">far</span> better to have some wages than no wages, so at the very bottom of the spectrum, the employer has all the power. And this situation actually really happened in the United States, in the early 20th century. The “Robber Barons” and the owners of the new industrial mills and workshops built whole Company Towns for the employees, they fed them, sheltered them, gave them coca-cola and whiskey, and paid them jack shit. It was a terrible situation. However, and this is a big however, it was <span class="bbcode-b">government over-regulation</span> that led to that situation to begin with. The robber barons were not market opportunists, they were political opportunists. They were buying senators, because it was a better investment than buying land. The same thing is happening now <span class="bbcode-b">Comcast buys senators</span> because it’s <span class="bbcode-b">cheaper than laying fiber.</span> They literally make more profit by enforcing their monopoly through corrupt politicians than by improving their service. What an evil corporation, right? Well, if you look at the other side, they are only doing what’s profitable for their shareholders, or their investors, or themselves. If it was more economically viable to lay fiber, they would lay fiber, and you would have 1GB internet, but it’s not.</p>
<p>So the minimum wage may be necessary, but that doesn’t make it right.</p>
<blockquote>Consider a community based pizza parlor selling 100 pies a day for 360 days at $10 each.  Total revenue is $360,000.  It employs 10 minimum wage workers earning $7 per hour, working 2000 hours a year, making labor costs $140,000.  Assume rent, utilities, equipment, depreciation, insurance, supplies, licenses, and food costs come to $170,000 per year, leaving a profit of $50,000 for the owner and his/her family.  Raising the minimum wage $1 would raise labor costs by $20,000 (paying more for the same amount of labor) and reduce profit to $30,000.  The owner must either move into a smaller house or raise prices, which reduces the demand for pizza, resulting in the loss of a worker.  So, the full increase in the wage cost of an increase in the minimum wage comes out of the pockets of customers or the owner’s family, and the one person who loses a job.  There was no net gain in income to increase spending in the community served as every dollar the minimum wage workers received came out of someone else’s pocket in the community.</blockquote>

</aside>
<p>you can’t have it both ways. either wages are increasing across the board and OPs theory is correct, or only a subset of employees get the rise. if the latter is true then minimum wage employees keep the same buying power for minimum wage products, keeping these companies in business - great. but everyone else is still on the same wage, so get a reduction in buying power. so your theory only really works if most of the employees in the economy are on minimum wage.</p>

        <p>A big mac, fries, and a soda at McDonalds in Norway costs $23.</p>
<p>It costs me about $8, in the US.</p>
<p>Now the worker at that McDonald’s makes $23/hr in Norway, and $8/hr in the US. This is not so much hypothetical, but these figures are actually pretty accurate for most of the US and Norway. Now, let me ask you something, who has more <span class="bbcode-b">real purchasing power</span>, the McDonalds worker in the US or Norway? The US worker does. Now that doesn’t necessarily equate to quality of life. The Norwegian worker may have more vacation time, more benefits, and greater opportunities for education, due to the social programs that have been enacted in that country.</p>
<p>Now, we have the US minimum wage.</p>
<blockquote>While the federal minimum wage was only $3.35 per hour in 1981 and is currently $7.25 per hour in real dollars, when adjusted for inflation, the current federal minimum wage would need to be more than $8 per hour to equal its buying power of the early 1980s and more nearly $11 per hour to equal its buying power of the late 1960s.</blockquote>
<p>The minimum wage has actually been <span class="bbcode-b">decreasing</span>, in real dollars. Adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage peaked in 1968. Increasing the real minimum wage, or indeed, even allowing it to keep pace with inflation,  has the well documented effect of increasing the spending power of the consumers on the lowest end of the spectrum, and will cause an influx of cash into the economy. But the question is really whether government interventionism for the purpose of redistribution of wealth is necessary, helpful, or even possible. Demonstrably, it is not possible. The very nature of currency and value guarantees that to subvert the Voluntary arrangements of the free market, is to debase the currency and destabilize the market.</p>
<p>Freedom of enterprise, and having true property rights without being coerced by force to use that property to benefit another, is economic freedom. When you enforce a minimum wage, quite simply you take it away. I believe that this is wrong.</p>
<blockquote>If economic inequality is an ailment, punishing effort and success is no cure in any event. Coercive, envy-based measures that aim to redistribute wealth prompt the smart or politically well-connected “haves” to seek refuge in havens here or abroad, while the hapless “have-nots” bear the full brunt of economic decline. A more productive expenditure of time would be to work to erase the mass of intrusive government that ensures that the “have-nots” are also the “cannots.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>After having thus successively taken each member of the community in its powerful grasp and fashioned him at will, the government then extends its arm over the whole community. It covers the surface of society with a network of small, complicated rules, minute and uniform, through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate to rise above the crowd. The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence: it does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.</blockquote>
