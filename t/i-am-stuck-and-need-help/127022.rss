    <description>Ok This is The Guide I followed but I got lost... :|

Table of Contents:

1. Introduction
2. Getting your server source
3. Getting the latest JDK
4. Getting a no-ip
5. Running your server.
6. FAQ

1. Introduction

I&#39;m not sure if this guide was already made in RSF. 
This guide will teace you how to run your own server. Im a newbie at this, so bare with me. There might be some erroes. Also please note that this is from my own mind, I used moparisthebest.com to help me.

You will need to know:
Basics of java 
How to download
How to unzip (winRAR)
If you have a router, how to port forward.
2. Getting a server source

Now if you join a moparscape server(s), you might find some that look alike, This is because they are probably from the same server source. A server source is where you can download a completely edited server when you can edit it yourself. Starting form scratch can take you months, so i prefer getting a server soucre. You can a list of them right here: Serve Source list Thanks to moparisthebest.com/smf

3. Getting the latest JDK (Java Development Kit)

Getting the latest JDK will help you to run your server. You can find a list of downloads Here
Download JDK 6u1 and install it. 

4. Getting a no-ip

Now we need to get you an ip adress, what other players type in to get into your server. This step is simple really. Go to no-ip.com and make an accouny. Then, once your registered, go to Hosts/Redirect and add a host. You can call it what ever you want. Then, choose creat host. If you have a router, then you must port forward for other people to join. 

5. Running your server

Ok, here we go. Time to run your server. Unzip the server source you downloaded with winRAR. Now go into it and double click run server. A black screen when you run something should appear along with another screen. Your server is now running. Open up moparscape 3.2 w/ Aryan installer. Select File&gt;New Ip and type in localhost. This is what the server source looks like. You know have a working server!

6. FAQ

How do I customize my server?

In your server source file, you should see client.java on notepad. Open that up, and you can change anytihng that is in &quot;quotes&quot;. Then open up client.class and put that in. This will change text that is in the orginal server source. There are other things you can change that I will not get into.

How do I port Forward?

Port Farwarding is a whole other thing I will not get into. There are some tuts in portforward.com

And I am stuck on this part... 5. Running your server
