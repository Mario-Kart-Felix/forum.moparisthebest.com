    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/winterscape-in-a-client/285936</link>
    <description>Ok, i have looked for a few mins for a client that is pretty empty, like a basic server and a basic client, nothing fancy but nothing to empty. Anything that fits this area????

Also

I am curious on the whole 317 type of thing, i have been away for a long time so im just restarting in JAVA, please explain these numbers, i know they correspond with runescapes updates but do they change the quality of any custom made objects??

Also

I am sorry if i am spamming, but i looked for the place to put this and if you look around this forum there is not many options...

-Thanks
