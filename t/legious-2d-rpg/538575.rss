[b]Welcome to the official game development thread for Legious, a future 2D role-playing game that will simulate the randomization of an infinite world, filled with monsters and allies, quests and dungeons, equipment and treasures, all of which will ultimately shape the progression of your character.[/b]

[hr]

The main goal of this project is to advance my knowledge in the field of game development, which not only includes the programming of the game itself, but several other levels of production, such as graphical development and content development. I hope to create a team of people that all have one thing in common; the desire to create something unique and exciting. Let&#39;s get onto the more important stuff, such as the content!

[code=java]
1/30/14 - State loading has been started; currently includes loading screen and menu.
1/30/14 - Sound loading system has been completed.
1/29/14 - Project design was redone, and several new goals have been put into place. The game is functioning and the skeleton for development has been created. Time to launch the beginning of Legious!
[/code]

Current issues/bugs:

[ul][li]None as of yet.[/li][/ul]

There are currently not a lot of updates to log, as the design has changed, and the overall direction of the project has changed (and is still subject to change if necessary), so sorry if the thread seems bland.

<p>I can see from the font that you’re using Slick 2D, which in itself includes a system for sound and canvas state loading.</p>

</aside>
<p>I apologize if my choice of words has confused you. I acknowledge that Slick’s API supports sound loading + state loading, but I didn’t mean that I completely invented the base loading itself. What I meant by ‘loading’ is I have created a design that works based on certain variables provided by the game.</p>
<p>For example:<br>
The sound system is initialized through API functionality, and then is integrated to work with my design so that it will function with the given application at hand, such as sound being loaded based on a certain state of game.</p>

              <p>I added an update log, so you can find the latest changes to the project there. I’ve been trying to design a system which will allow region loading, but the idea behind it is rather complicated and I can’t quite seem how to approach the problem at hand. Basically, I have determined how I can randomly generate maps once a player has exited a region of the screen (if the x or y coordinate is out of bounds of the screen), and I would like to keep that randomization to add a feeling of mysteriousness to the game, but once a region has been loaded, I would like it to be saved, so once a player goes back in the opposite direction, rather than generating a new map, it will regenerate the old map that used to be there.</p>

<span class="bbcode-b">Welcome to the official game development thread for Legious, a future 2D role-playing game that will simulate the randomization of an infinite world, filled with monsters and allies, quests and dungeons, equipment and treasures, all of which will ultimately shape the progression of your character.</span></p>

<p>The main goal of this project is to advance my knowledge in the field of game development, which not only includes the programming of the game itself, but several other levels of production, such as graphical development and content development. I hope to create a team of people that all have one thing in common; the desire to create something unique and exciting. Let’s get onto the more important stuff, such as the content!</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">1/30/14 - State loading has been started; currently includes loading screen and menu.
1/30/14 - Sound loading system has been completed.
1/29/14 - Project design was redone, and several new goals have been put into place. The game is functioning and the skeleton for development has been created. Time to launch the beginning of Legious!</code></pre>
<p>Current issues/bugs:</p>
<p>[ul][li]None as of yet.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>There are currently not a lot of updates to log, as the design has changed, and the overall direction of the project has changed (and is still subject to change if necessary), so sorry if the thread seems bland.</p>
