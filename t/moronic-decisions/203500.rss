It&#39;s amazing how moronic some of the staff members are. You think you are capable of curing pure stupidity? You are incorrect. There are reasons for the division within the community. If you are unable to figure out what those are, then i suggest you go die in a reasonably large fire. 

I&#39;m going to take a stab in the dark and say this idea was Silabs. It seems that no matter how idiotic an idea is, Mopar will always be there to support her. In my opinion, Mopar should take a long look at who he uses as staff members. Oh well, now i know that i need to pretend to be a part of the opposite sex next time around. 

I could have said a lot more about the topic, but it would simply be a waste of my time. The forums are a collections of opinions. I have now expressed mine. If anyone finds this too insulting, i would be more than happy to edit some of it out. It&#39;s not my intention to cause conflict. After all, Mopar does run this community and i do respect that. Enough said.

EDIT: Missing Word.</description>

That is very true. You need trust. Unfortunately joining MoparScape usually results in lost of trust. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>There are various reasons for Moparscape moderators having/lacking various powers.</p>
<p>Firstly there’s an age related issue - I do not believe that some of the younger moderators have the ability to make impartial decisions when handing out such punishments (which have the ability to completely incapacitate a user’s account). I’m aware of the difficulty some younger mods have with disciplining people that they consider friends.</p>
<p>Secondly there’s the obvious security issue. I don’t think any more needs to be said.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I personally disagree with giving people higher permissions on this forum when they have their own large communities to run.<br>
It has the potential to create a conflict in interests; a moderator here (who shall remain anonymous) has used things restricted on this website (such as copy and paste tutorials, which are unwelcome) to encourage users to join his own website (which conveniently allows such tutorials).<br>
That is a conflict in interest, and in this case scenario he has obviously chosen what is in his site’s best interest, instead of this site’s best interest (questionable, I know - I’m sure some of us welcome the removal of certain users).</p>
<p>This is quite all right, and naturally it makes sense to do what’s in the best interest of your own site. But in saying that, I don’t think it’s right to admit such people to higher echelons of the moderator team.</p>
<p>Please note that these opinions are mine and mine alone. They couldn’t possibly represent the views of the entire forum staff, and other members of staff will have their own opinions on the matter.</p>

              <p>What about this;</p>
<ul>
<li>First write a simple sql to remove already expired bans from the table.</li>
<li>Then move all the bans with ‘expire_time: NULL’ to an extra database, but leave the not-permanent bans on the old table.</li>
<li>Then make the forum load the database with the permanent bans <span class="bbcode-b">AND</span> the normal ban table both, to check if the user has been banned.<br>
When making bans, just let it reload the normal ban table like it currently does because it will not be as large as it currently is, as long it’s not reloading the additional database with the large amount of permanent bans it will be fine I think.</li>

Although this is just going off what i have heard, i may of misunderstood.[/quote]In my opinion I think you misunderstood. Only because if it crashes due to loading/writing from HUGE databases, then loading SMALLER databases (but more of them) should stop the crashing? (Yes its the same amount of loading, but its faster recursing through the smaller databases.)</p>
