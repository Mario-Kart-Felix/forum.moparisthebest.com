    <description>Hey,
I have just been nosing through moparscape server downloads, I found a post with floor id&#39;s, object ids, etc.

I downloaded the floor ids list, and I was wondering... How can I add them to my server?
Because I want to add ice pebbles to my flooring - and as its not a object I don&#39;t know where to add it.

Note: I do [b]not[/b] use a client!
Please help! ;) [b]Help most appreciated[/b]

If anyone knows, I will really appreciate for you too tell me :)
Thank You
