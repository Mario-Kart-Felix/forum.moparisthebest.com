    <title>Need help with ::hp and auto retaliate!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-hp-and-auto-retaliate/339267</link>
    <description>i need help. my ::hp command doesnt give hp to a player with a space in their name. Also my auto retaliate works but to turn it on or off i have to go to the character files. there is no button for it on my server. any help for each is greatly appreciated

My ::hp command (gives users hp)
[code] if (command.startsWith(&quot;hp&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 2)) {
		        String[] args = command.split(&quot; &quot;);
	        if(args.length == 3) {
			String otherPName = (args[1]);
			int otherPIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(otherPName);
			int bonus = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
			if (otherPIndex != -1) {
			client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];
			p.currentHealth = bonus;
			} else {
				sM(&quot;No such person in this world!!&quot;);
			}
		} else {
			sM(&quot;Oops! Use as ::hp playername 1000&quot;);
		}
	    } [/code]</description>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">String[] args = command.split(" ");</code></pre>
<p>When you enter the command on a player with a space in his/her username, the above will ALSO split the player’s name, thus making this command unworkable. So to make my above sentence make more sense in case you dont understand, look at this;</p>
<p>::hp Project Evolution 1000<br>
^args=1   ^args=2  ^args=3</p>
<p>So basically what im trying to get across is, the command is being split up at an index where it shouldnt. So instead of having the second index (args[2]) read the integer you entered for the HP, it read the second part of the player’s username.</p>
<p>Since I could not explain that for the life of me, what im trying to say is in this case stick to substring() instead of splitting the string/command when it comes to player names.</p>
