    <description>Hi, my friend just made a server but he can&#39;t get the cache to work properly, he has tried many things and it keeps getting black screen when he opens the server. the only reason we are able to play is because we download the cache and put it in our user directory. 
what could he do so that the cache actually works without having to put it in the user directory?</description>

              <p>I don’t tottally understand what you’re saying but from what I think, try adding a update server because that way  the client will automatically download the cache into the correct directory.</p>
