    <title>What starting spot would you recommend?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-starting-spot-would-you-recommend/125902</link>
    <description>Basically I&#39;ve been working on a little project that I want to progress into something big. The client is basically done, but I&#39;m now getting to the server. 
It&#39;s based off HellzEnd (&lt;3) and the starting spot is great, but I hate servers that are the same as their base source with two different commands &gt;_&lt;.. I never do that, I always make the server as unique as possible, as well as the client. What I&#39;m getting at is this: Where do you think you&#39;d like to start in a server?

You might think it&#39;s a waste of time thinking about it. It&#39;s not, because where you start is where alot of people stay to train etc..
Places that are out of the question are Varrock and the original starting place in HellzEnd in the Wilderness.

Once I see where everyone wants to start out I&#39;ll rebuild the entire training grounds and shops etc etc..

Please provide where and why to my question.

On a side note, when the server hits over 20 people playing on average 24/7 I&#39;ll need a new Hoster. I have good a good Internet connection but only 382 MB RAM. PM me if your interested in Hosting. You have to be able to host 24/7 and have at least a gig of RAM, as well as a great Internet connection. Obviously the hoster will have administrator on the server and forums.</description>

It is in the desert, and i dont think it is 377, i think it is there on 317.</p>

              <p>It’s more of a lighted type of server. Nothing like the wilderness or TzHaar. I like Entrana, since I’ve never seen anyone’s server based off it. As a matter of fact, I think I will base it in Entrana. But first, would anyone else like to start in Entrana?</p>

              <p>Basically I’ve been working on a little project that I want to progress into something big. The client is basically done, but I’m now getting to the server.<br>
It’s based off HellzEnd (&lt;3) and the starting spot is great, but I hate servers that are the same as their base source with two different commands &gt;_&lt;… I never do that, I always make the server as unique as possible, as well as the client. What I’m getting at is this: Where do you think you’d like to start in a server?</p>
<p>You might think it’s a waste of time thinking about it. It’s not, because where you start is where alot of people stay to train etc…<br>
Places that are out of the question are Varrock and the original starting place in HellzEnd in the Wilderness.</p>
<p>Once I see where everyone wants to start out I’ll rebuild the entire training grounds and shops etc etc…</p>
<p>Please provide where and why to my question.</p>
<p>On a side note, when the server hits over 20 people playing on average 24/7 I’ll need a new Hoster. I have good a good Internet connection but only 382 MB RAM. PM me if your interested in Hosting. You have to be able to host 24/7 and have at least a gig of RAM, as well as a great Internet connection. Obviously the hoster will have administrator on the server and forums.</p>
