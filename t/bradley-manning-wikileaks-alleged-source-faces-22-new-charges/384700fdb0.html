<p>it’s quite simple really, you either lock them up or you murder them</p>
<p>I believe you said yourself that as long as say, a child molester doesn’t act on his feelings that it’s ok, wouldn’t you rather find the cause of these feelings and attempt to correct them? regardless if they have acted on them <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">or not?</span></span></p>
<p>and to answer your hypothetical question, the state would have failed, and can be blamed for it, while the offender would be guilty of the crime. what were you hoping for?</p>

Yes, thats what I’m saying. You should of course not let someone out if you think they are a danger to the society (A problem with the criminal system today, not only in US) and you should of course help them if you could.</p>
<p>I don’t believe in good or bad people, only in good and bad actions and that they are for the most determined by influence by other and your past. And if something in the past turned you into doing bad things, I’m sure you can turn them to stop such actions.</p>
<p>You are catholic right? It surprise me how rarely many religious people follow their scripture</p>
<p>[quote=Romans 12:19 ESV]Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.”<br>
[/quote] And if you didn’t understand my point, killing people is revenge…[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t view execution of a murderer, rapist, or child molester as revenge.  I view it as prevention of the same person committing the same crime again.  I am catholic, and the catholic church is entirely against capital punishment, but I disagree with them on this point.</p>
<p>Pedophiles for example generally repeat their offenses after release on average of 80-90% of the time.  That is ridiculous.  If you had an 80-90% chance of dying every time you walked out to get the mail, you would never do it, which is why we should never release pedophiles once they are caught.  And if you are never going to release them, there is no use in keeping them around…</p>

<blockquote>The U.S. soldier accused of leaking secret government files to Wikileaks was stripped and left naked in his cell for seven hours this week, his lawyer said.
Private Bradley Manning’s confinement conditions at a marine-run facility in Quantico, Virginia, have attracted criticism from supporters and lawyer David Coombs.
The intelligence analyst could face the death penalty after being accused of ‘aiding the enemy’ by leaking tens of thousands of confidential embassy cables to Wikileaks.
<p>The 23-year-old’s clothing was returned to him a day later on Thursday, after he was forced to stand naked outside his cell during an inspection, Mr Coombs said.<br>
‘This type of degrading treatment is inexcusable and without justification,’ he said. ‘It is an embarrassment to our military justice system and should not be tolerated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fail to see how the US can take the moral high ground against dictators like Saddam Hussain, Gaddafi or Mubarak.<br>
Also aren’t cruel and degrading punishments against the constitution?</p>
<p>And threatening a man who did nothing but blow the whistle on the lies that were being sold to the public about the war in Afghanistan with the death penalty? It’s not as if he was fighting for the enemy killing US soldiers or attempting to harm any American citizens. John Walker Lindh, who actually trained with Al Qaeda and fought alongside the Taliban only got twenty years. Leave it to America to give a violent terrorist only twenty years, but put a patriot to death.</p>
<p>How is this significantly different from what Ellsberg did when he released the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War? Both released documents showed that the public rhetoric of politicians did not match the internal analyses that said politicians were privy to. How can a democracy function when information pertaining to an issue of great public interest is systematically withheld from the populace by the government? I think bringing to light information pertaining to corruption withheld from the public by governments or corporations is the very definition of whistleblowing.</p>

<p>Seriously, who the fuck do you think you are?  You have absolutely no say in who dies and who lives, no one has that right.  And if someone thinks that they have the right to make that call then they need to be punished, because its called murder.  Whether you’re shooting a little boy or a cold blooded killer…its murder…and you deserve to pay for that.  Certainly not through more death.</p>
<p>And whoever the fuck the idiot was who ran his mouth about how its the way it always was and shouldn’t change…hey bro guess what happened to slavery?  The constitution is a fucking joke and needs a great deal of updating.</p>
<p>Fucking dumb ass americans.  With your logic id bomb the shit out of your ignorant brainwashed country and laugh and say I did the world a favor because you’re all animals.</p>

<p>[quote]The U.S. soldier accused of leaking secret government files to Wikileaks was stripped and left naked in his cell for seven hours this week, his lawyer said.<br>
Private Bradley Manning’s confinement conditions at a marine-run facility in Quantico, Virginia, have attracted criticism from supporters and lawyer David Coombs.<br>
The intelligence analyst could face the death penalty after being accused of ‘aiding the enemy’ by leaking tens of thousands of confidential embassy cables to Wikileaks.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old’s clothing was returned to him a day later on Thursday, after he was forced to stand naked outside his cell during an inspection, Mr Coombs said.<br>
‘This type of degrading treatment is inexcusable and without justification,’ he said. ‘It is an embarrassment to our military justice system and should not be tolerated.[/quote]</p>
<p>I fail to see how the US can take the moral high ground against dictators like Saddam Hussain, Gaddafi or Mubarak.<br>
Also aren’t cruel and degrading punishments against the constitution?</p>
<p>And threatening a man who did nothing but blow the whistle on the lies that were being sold to the public about the war in Afghanistan with the death penalty? It’s not as if he was fighting for the enemy killing US soldiers or attempting to harm any American citizens. John Walker Lindh, who actually trained with Al Qaeda and fought alongside the Taliban only got twenty years. Leave it to America to give a violent terrorist only twenty years, but put a patriot to death.</p>
<p>How is this significantly different from what Ellsberg did when he released the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War? Both released documents showed that the public rhetoric of politicians did not match the internal analyses that said politicians were privy to. How can a democracy function when information pertaining to an issue of great public interest is systematically withheld from the populace by the government? I think bringing to light information pertaining to corruption withheld from the public by governments or corporations is the very definition of whistleblowing.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hopefully like Frell said they did it for a legitimate reason like to stop him from committing suicide.  (though it would save quite a bit of hassle if he did)  If not, then that isn’t right at all, I’d hate for some abuse thing to pop up and get him off from the consequences he should receive.</p>

Pedophiles for example generally repeat their offenses after release on average of 80-90% of the time.  That is ridiculous.  If you had an 80-90% chance of dying every time you walked out to get the mail, you would never do it, which is why we should never release pedophiles once they are caught.

<p>That is right.  Murderers don’t have a right to kill innocent people.  Pedophiles don’t have the right to abusse, molest, and rape defenseless little children.  And, as far as I’m concerned, once they choose to take those rights from their victims, they lose rights themselves.  Like the right to freedom, the right to live in our society, the right to be called human, the right to life.</p>

i was just kidding, in reality i see all religions as equal, but the pedophile stuff sickens me, i am sure you are a good catholic, and trust the people at the church, and when they do these to kids, well i don’t know how you can still respect a religion that has been over looking this for the past 100 years, now i got nothing against god, i believe religion and god are two different entity.</p>

Sex drive is a consequence of producing testosterone. If you chop a guy’s dick and testicles off then he doesn’t produce testosterone, and doesn’t have sex drive at all.</p>
