<p>Fiddle around with emote/anim IDs.</p>
<p>Or you could always try animating one yourself. It’s somewhat fun to do, if you have the time.</p>
<p>I’ve tried making a 2h blocking emote that would’ve been epic, if I weren’t so fail at making emotes.[/quote]</p>
<p>I wouldn’t know where to start, what files is the animations in &amp; emotes and what do you search to find them?</p>
