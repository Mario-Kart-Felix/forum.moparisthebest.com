    <title>[BCEL] - Help me cover a few arising questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bcel-help-me-cover-a-few-arising-questions/157263</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working with BCEL lately and alot of old questions are answered along with the uprise of new ones. I&#39;ve worked out how to change around simple classes; even a few ones such as text in the client etc etc. I&#39;m trying to commit alot of this to memory but as I get further along all of these new questions are arising. For starters..

-Can explain the whole concept of the &quot;entity&quot; and how it&#39;s important in runescape client hacking, this is definetley a prolific question that I&#39;d love to have answered
-Could you offer a few tips on how to quickly locate and recognize pattern within the client code; I know there&#39;s alot of people who can do this very quickly. Anything will help

Thanks a million, Speedster239...

</aside>
<p>It might help if we do some of the work, ie build a deobber and renamer and then let them improve each “module” as it were. The problem is that then there is no incentive to build something better because you already have the output. I really don’t see a solution except slow development by a few obsessed people (ie. me).</p>

<p>im not so sure about this, when i started learning about updating and stuff, there was never any of this information ether, but i think its quite obvious in some way, like look for this method/field of this type/number of fields or whatever.</p>

              <p>There are many ways to pattern match. Basically any structure/feature/property of the client is fair game to a pattern matcher. What you are looking for are things that don’t change from client version to version but do change from class to class, method to method, instruction to instruction, etc… depending on the scale you are looking for.</p>
<p>Unfortunately except for primitive hooks you are not going to find much information on these forums. That said it might give you a few ideas. The reason for this secrecy is the fear that by revealing what you hook that there is a possibility that jagex will find out and build a obfuscater specifically to break it. As it is said in another thread: this will eventually destroy the community either due to shear inactivity or new members unable to learn because the information is not available.</p>
