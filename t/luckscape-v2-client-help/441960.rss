    <title>Luckscape v2 client help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/luckscape-v2-client-help/441960</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

i just joined the forums and thought i could get some help.

i recently downloaded the luckscape v2 source which is great for me to work on! but the problem is i downloaded the cache and source but the client link is broken no matter where i look.. i would appreciate it if someone could upload the client for me.

also is there anyway i can use another client and edit it somehow so that i can use the luckscape v2 source on it? 

i cant use any general 317 client as this source has customs.

any help would be greatly appreciated.
thanks a lot.</description>
