    <description>If you notace when you open scar it says &quot;scar will be contunied once i get the time&quot; or somthing like that, apperntly im thinking that means that he will be back and hopes of RS cheating will rise, i dought hes even remmber anything about runescape sense when he shut the site down in early febuary...But the only person that knows is himself: kaitnieks, will he be back? What do you think rs cheating will be back if he comes back? Think he could bring back the willing ment of the scripters? I know most people have given up hope, but not me, you never know, just because he hasnt really done anything doesnt mean hes not planning things for the rs cheating community...What do you think?
