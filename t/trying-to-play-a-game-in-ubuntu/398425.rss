    <title>Trying to play a game in Ubuntu</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trying-to-play-a-game-in-ubuntu/398425</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve tried numerous times trying to pay Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare in Ubuntu Linux 11.04 under Wine 1.2.3, and wine 1.3(beta).  I&#39;ve also tried mw2, but I accidentally deleted it and I didn&#39;t want to wait again.  So, yeah, I downloaded COD4 from thepiratebay.org I got the cod4 proper skidrow.  Now, everything installed correctly, but I kept getting an error while trying to enter a game &quot;directx error: directx encountered an unrecoverable error&quot;  I&#39;ve tried re-installing cod4, and re-installing wine.  I have directx installed under winetricks, and it still won&#39;t work for me. This happens for both single player and multiplayer. I&#39;ve patched the game to 1.7, and nothing works.  I can load the menu scren, but when I try to play a game or something, a dialogue box opens up and it gives me that error.  Does anyone know how to fix this, or can someone give me some info that might help?</description>

Lol, people have gotten it to work under wine, and I can’t really do it on windows because, I host on my computer. Also, my brothers are always using the laptops, so, I’m gonna try virtualbox.</p>
