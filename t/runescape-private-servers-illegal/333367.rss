      as long as you aren&#39;t using it to defraud regular runescape users in anyway, then you should be fine.

      No the aren&#39;t because they are public. If they weren&#39;t public then you would not know about it and they would keep it to themselves.

Why You Should Never Use RuneScape Private Servers..
Published by Noodleman on November 1, 2009 in RuneScape

Why you should never use Runescape private servers, or even worse, make them…

There are plenty of good reasons that you shouldn’t use Runescape private servers, or any private servers for that matter.  There are even more reasons why you shouldn’t make a Runescape private server.  In this article I will explain some of them.

I think the best reason not to use a Runescape private server is that it ruins the fun of the game.  Because the point of most private servers is that you can level much faster than in the normal game.  And then if you buy membership for private servers you can level even faster most of the time.  This means that everyone will get to level 99 in every skill.  So the concept of the game is ruined.

Another reason is that private servers are illegal.  This doesn’t mean that you could get charged or get a fine for playing on private servers.  But the people who run and operate private servers get huge fines, and they all get tracked down eventually.  Personally I don’t think its worth the risk.

It costs Jagex’s legal department lots of money to track down all these people who operate private servers.  And it makes it even harder if you include the fact that most private servers are in Russia where people can do almost anything.  Anyway, if they didn’t have to spend all that money on tracking down private servers maybe they could spend the money on improving Runescape, making membership cheaper, or taking the ads off free world accounts.

This is why you should not make a private server or support one by playing on it.  There is an article on Triond explaining how to make a private server!  I cannot believe Triond would publish something telling you how to do something illegal…

Anyway, thanks for reading!  If you liked this article you also might like “Jagex can’t Sue Runescape private servers” and “Most of our illegal internet content comes from Russia“&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Another beautifully constructed poll on another complex and ambiguous topic. I mean seriously, are they illegal? I thought the answer was blatantly obvious to everyone but apparently not.</p>
<p>Even 57.1% of the voters are morons (as the results stand now)</p>

  as long as you aren't using it to defraud regular runescape users in anyway, then you should be fine.

  No the aren't because they are public. If they weren't public then you would not know about it and they would keep it to themselves.

Why You Should Never Use RuneScape Private Servers..
Published by Noodleman on November 1, 2009 in RuneScape
<p>Why you should never use Runescape private servers, or even worse, make them…</p>
<p>There are plenty of good reasons that you shouldn’t use Runescape private servers, or any private servers for that matter.  There are even more reasons why you shouldn’t make a Runescape private server.  In this article I will explain some of them.</p>
<p>I think the best reason not to use a Runescape private server is that it ruins the fun of the game.  Because the point of most private servers is that you can level much faster than in the normal game.  And then if you buy membership for private servers you can level even faster most of the time.  This means that everyone will get to level 99 in every skill.  So the concept of the game is ruined.<br>

<p>Another reason is that private servers are illegal.  This doesn’t mean that you could get charged or get a fine for playing on private servers.  But the people who run and operate private servers get huge fines, and they all get tracked down eventually.  Personally I don’t think its worth the risk.</p>
<p>It costs Jagex’s legal department lots of money to track down all these people who operate private servers.  And it makes it even harder if you include the fact that most private servers are in Russia where people can do almost anything.  Anyway, if they didn’t have to spend all that money on tracking down private servers maybe they could spend the money on improving Runescape, making membership cheaper, or taking the ads off free world accounts.</p>
<p>This is why you should not make a private server or support one by playing on it.  There is an article on Triond explaining how to make a private server!  I cannot believe Triond would publish something telling you how to do something illegal…</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for reading!  If you liked this article you also might like “Jagex can’t Sue Runescape private servers” and “Most of our illegal internet content comes from Russia“</p>
