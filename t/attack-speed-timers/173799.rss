    <title>Attack speed timers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/attack-speed-timers/173799</link>
    <description>ok i need help with my timers.. like ppl in combat can attack really fast.. massing i guess, and i want to slow it down to more of a real rs speed so ppl can&#39;t do that

ive been told to search for
Code:

actiontimer = o

but there is sooo many. and the ones i have changed make no difference in the speed that someone attacks, so can someone plz tell me what timer(s) to change? and to a more realistic number, as i said closer to a rs speed?

for example if done this

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (4151)) // whip
{
PkingDelay = 30;
wepdelay = 30;
resetanim = 30;
}
[/code]
[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (4151)) // whip
{
PkingDelay = 13;
wepdelay = 13;
resetanim = 13;
}[/code]
[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (4151)) // whip
{
PkingDelay = 5;
wepdelay = 5;
resetanim = 5;
} [/code]
all 3 of these are in my client.java

ive changed all 3 sets of timers all around so many difffernt ways and they don&#39;t stop ppl from attacking super fast...

there has to be a way.. cuz czar sources attack speeds are slow and it don&#39;t matter how many times or how fast someone clicks it stays the same speed..</description>
