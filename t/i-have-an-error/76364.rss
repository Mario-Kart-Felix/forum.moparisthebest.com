              <p>Error Messages on Microsoft Windows Systems</p>
<p>Exception in thread “main” java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: HelloWorldApp</p>
<p>If you receive this error, java cannot find your bytecode file, HelloWorldApp.class.</p>
<p>One of the places java tries to find your .class file is your current directory. So if your .class file is in C:\java, you should change your current directory to that. To change your directory, type the following command at the prompt and press Enter:</p>
<p>cd c:\java</p>
<p>The prompt should change to C:\java&gt;. If you enter dir at the prompt, you should see your .java and .class files. Now enter java HelloWorldApp again.</p>
<p>If you still have problems, you might have to change your CLASSPATH variable. To see if this is necessary, try clobbering the classpath with the following command.</p>
<p>set CLASSPATH=</p>
<p>Now enter java HelloWorldApp again. If the program works now, you’ll have to change your CLASSPATH variable. To set this variable, consult the Update the PATH variable section in the JDK 6 installation instructions. The CLASSPATH variable is set in the same manner.</p>
<p>Exception in thread “main” java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: HelloWorldApp/class<br>
A common mistake made by beginner programmers is to try and run the java launcher on the .class file that was created by the compiler. For example, you’ll get this error if you try to run your program with java HelloWorldApp.class instead of java HelloWorldApp. Remember, the argument is the name of the class that you want to use, not the filename.</p>
<p>Exception in thread “main” java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main</p>
<p>The Java VM requires that the class you execute with it have a main method at which to begin execution of your application. A Closer Look at the “Hello World!” Application discusses the main method in detail.</p>
<p>Error Messages on UNIX Systems</p>
<p>Exception in thread “main” java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: HelloWorldApp</p>
<p>If you receive this error, java cannot find your bytecode file, HelloWorldApp.class.</p>
<p>One of the places java tries to find your bytecode file is your current directory. So, for example, if your bytecode file is in /home/jdoe/java, you should change your current directory to that. To change your directory, type the following command at the prompt and press Return:</p>
<p>cd /home/jdoe/java</p>
<p>If you enter pwd at the prompt, you should see /home/jdoe/java. If you enter ls at the prompt, you should see your .java and .class files. Now enter java HelloWorldApp again.</p>
<p>If you still have problems, you might have to change your CLASSPATH environment variable. To see if this is necessary, try clobbering the classpath with the following command.</p>
<p>unset CLASSPATH</p>
<p>Now enter java HelloWorldApp again. If the program works now, you’ll have to change your CLASSPATH variable in the same manner as the PATH variable above.</p>
<p>Exception in thread “main” java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: HelloWorldApp/class<br>
A common mistake made by beginner programmers is to try and run the java launcher on the .class file that was created by the compiler.
