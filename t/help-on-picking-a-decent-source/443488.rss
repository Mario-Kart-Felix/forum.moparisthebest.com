    <title>Help on picking a decent source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-on-picking-a-decent-source/443488</link>
    <description>Let me start by saying I don&#39;t have a lot of experience in coding servers. Although I&#39;ve been here since like 2006, I haven&#39;t spent a lot of time working on sources. I have owned a few fairly successful servers back in 2008. So I have some experience but it&#39;s been a long time. Anyways, I&#39;ve recently come back to the RSPS community and now I&#39;ve decided I want to start up my own server! Here is what I want; I want a 317 source, I want to mix old school with new school a little bit but mainly old school, I want a relatively clean base and no customs, weapons like dragon claws and god swords, not tons of bugs I will have to spend most of my time working on, something I can work on and in the end have a unique, nice server.
Any suggestions are welcome.
Thanks!</description>

You CAN package a delta.<br>

<p>Hey, fucktard, I didn’t say they couldn’t be packaged, do you even know what a fucking package is? Or is your head too far up your asshole to even learn it? How does one “code”? I believe the term is “program” or “develop”. As I said before, Delta is horribly programmed, even the clean one. A horrible choice for starters, it seems as though your still a fucking idiot, so I guess you probably think Delta is a good choice, when it is not. <span class="mention">@OP</span>: Guys like this epitomize whats wrong with Moparscape. So don’t listen.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>The term “to code” == to program. It’s easier to type.<br>
And obviously you haven’t seen a good delta. They CAN be extremely great, assuming the one behind the computer programming it is smart enough.<br>
Oh btw, you did say it can’t be packaged. In different terms.<br>
I made the text red to show where.<br>
That seems really close to “They cannot be packaged.”[/quote]<br>
Anyone smart enough would write their own framework or use something like Hyperion, not resort to a Delta… what pro “coder” pulled the wool over your eyes?</p>
<p>They = the programmer, as in “they don’t bother to package it”.</p>

<p>delta is horribly programmed, however the packaging thing doesn’t mean anything. packaging is purely for organization, it has 0 effect on the server itself</p>

Well I’m sorry your parents can’t afford to send you to a good school. If they could, possibly your English comprehension would be better. Delta still sucks. Horrible for a beginner. Obviously you started with Delta or PI, which is why your still ignorant.<br>

<p>Now you are going out of your way to not only go against what I say, be rude, and make fun of my family? Seriously you need to grow the fuck up and get a new damn life. Everyone is entitled their own opinions. My opinion is delta is way better then other 317’s, just no one takes the time to fix them up correctly.<br>
inb4 you continue your flamer rage.[/quote]</p>
<p>Even with a lot of work Delta would struggle to fit in with other higher performing frameworks. The difference between the two is Delta is more or less a finished product that is ready to see the world, and then the other frameworks have the tools to get started, they just don’t have the content needed to gain popularity.</p>

Just so you all know Apollo uses the same player updating design as a WinterLove server one of the differences it just does it in a multi-threaded approach.</p>
<p>You should also know if you wish to learn more and create more content on a WinterLove designed server and wish to keep some of the look and feel, then RuneSource is your pick, the real difference is that RuneSource is a high performing version then the regular older WinterLove.</p>

You CAN package a delta.<br>
And people code them wrong because the ones that get a hold of the deltas and release them are NOOBS!<br>
Here is a clean and PACKAGED delta.<br>

Hey, fucktard, I didn’t say they couldn’t be packaged, do you even know what a fucking package is? Or is your head too far up your asshole to even learn it? How does one “code”? I believe the term is “program” or “develop”. As I said before, Delta is horribly programmed, even the clean one. A horrible choice for starters, it seems as though your still a fucking idiot, so I guess you probably think Delta is a good choice, when it is not. <span class="mention">@OP</span>: Guys like this epitomize whats wrong with Moparscape. So don’t listen.</p>

I’ll be going with the utopia source of delta. Say what you will but delta is and always will be, FTW.<br>
Also, I’ve never heard of hyperion so I was curious to check it out. IMO it’s pretty weird, and I don’t like it much.<br>
PS: There’s no way in hell I’m going back to winterlove. I started with that shit and I can CLEARLY remember what that was like.</p>

              <p>Let me start by saying I don’t have a lot of experience in coding servers. Although I’ve been here since like 2006, I haven’t spent a lot of time working on sources. I have owned a few fairly successful servers back in 2008. So I have some experience but it’s been a long time. Anyways, I’ve recently come back to the RSPS community and now I’ve decided I want to start up my own server! Here is what I want; I want a 317 source, I want to mix old school with new school a little bit but mainly old school, I want a relatively clean base and no customs, weapons like dragon claws and god swords, not tons of bugs I will have to spend most of my time working on, something I can work on and in the end have a unique, nice server.<br>
Any suggestions are welcome.<br>
Thanks!</p>
