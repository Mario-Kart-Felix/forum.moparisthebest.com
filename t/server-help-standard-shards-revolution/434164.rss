    <title>Server Help, Standard Shards Revolution?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-help-standard-shards-revolution/434164</link>
    <description>I need help coding a Shard Revolutions server. It&#39;s the original, so I will have to do everything including pvp pvm home shops etc.


I really need someone&#39;s help, someone committed to helping people learn. I&#39;m 14 years old and I decided coding is what I will do with my life, even though I currently suck. So I just wanted to do a private server, something I&#39;ve wanted for 2 years, but me and my brother are currently trying to seriously get it done. 
[b]I have aim, so if you do too, we can use it for easy messaging... aim name is: tsunadevovo@gmail.com[/b]

Please pm me your aim username and tell me your experience with creating private servers. :) ;D :D</description>
