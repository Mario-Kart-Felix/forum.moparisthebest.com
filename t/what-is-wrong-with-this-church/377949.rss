    <title>What is wrong with this church?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-wrong-with-this-church/377949</link>
    <description>ok as you know a shooter killed 6 people in arizona and thay are all having their funerals soon...well read what this church thinks about it.....

Westboro Baptist Church, the Topeka church known for its inflammatory anti-gay protests, plans to picket the funerals of the six people gunned down in Arizona on Saturday.

In a flier posted on its web site, the controversial church writes, &quot;THANK GOD FOR THE SHOOTER -- 6 DEAD!&quot; The message continues:

God appointed this rod for your sins! God sent the shooter! This hateful nation unleashed violent veterans on the servants of God at WBC--hoping to silence our kind warning to obey God and flee the wrath to come.
The flier claims that the shooting of both a House member and a federal judge -- the latter of whom was killed -- is god&#39;s punishment for judicial and Congressional action against the WBC. &quot;God sent the shooter to shoot you! And He&#39;s sitting in Heaven laughing at you!&quot; the announcement reads.

In graphic language, it continues:

Your federal judge is dead and your (fag-promoting, baby-killing, proud-sinner) Congresswoman fights for her life. God is avenging Himself on this rebellious house! WBC prays for your destruction--more shooters, more dead carcasses piling up, young, old, leader and commoner--all. Your doom is upon you!
In December, Westboro Baptist Church picketed the funeral of Elizabeth Edwards. The group is known to display signs that say &quot;God Hates Fags&quot; and &quot;Thank God For Dead Soldiers.&quot;

They never died lmfao. They are in my states parade every year, along with the black panthers. Two years ago, KKK was at front, and black panthers were at back. Its not that they were invited, its just when you got 200-300 men all with guns (shooting nobody, all had licenses to hold them), its not like your gonna walk up and start a war. Anyways, the KKK has not died, the Nazi’s have not died, any “clan” or “gang” that gets the followers they did, will never die.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Echo_</span> - I think they believe god sent them (duh), and the murders were justified because (a guess here) the church had some judicial suits/issues filed on them. Just a complete guess though lmfao. Please don’t make it out as if I’m agreeing with them, as I am not, and I am not looking to start a flame war, was just stating what I believe they think.</p>

              <p>ok as you know a shooter killed 6 people in arizona and thay are all having their funerals soon…well read what this church thinks about it…</p>
<p>Westboro Baptist Church, the Topeka church known for its inflammatory anti-gay protests, plans to picket the funerals of the six people gunned down in Arizona on Saturday.</p>
<p>In a flier posted on its web site, the controversial church writes, “THANK GOD FOR THE SHOOTER – 6 DEAD!” The message continues:</p>
<p>God appointed this rod for your sins! God sent the shooter! This hateful nation unleashed violent veterans on the servants of God at WBC–hoping to silence our kind warning to obey God and flee the wrath to come.<br>
The flier claims that the shooting of both a House member and a federal judge – the latter of whom was killed – is god’s punishment for judicial and Congressional action against the WBC. “God sent the shooter to shoot you! And He’s sitting in Heaven laughing at you!” the announcement reads.</p>
<p>In graphic language, it continues:</p>
<p>Your federal judge is dead and your (fag-promoting, baby-killing, proud-sinner) Congresswoman fights for her life. God is avenging Himself on this rebellious house! WBC prays for your destruction–more shooters, more dead carcasses piling up, young, old, leader and commoner–all. Your doom is upon you!<br>
In December, Westboro Baptist Church picketed the funeral of Elizabeth Edwards. The group is known to display signs that say “God Hates Fags” and “Thank God For Dead Soldiers.”</p>
