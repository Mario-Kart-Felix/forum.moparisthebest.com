    <title>Building a new piece of shit :D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/building-a-new-piece-of-shit-d/414440</link>
    <description>well, iv burned out another board and chip so i guess its time to make a new one! was wondering if you guys could take a look over my system and tell em what you think.. i still cannot decide if i should use 24gb of ram @ 1600mhz or 12gb of ram at 2000mhz+ i run alot of VM&#39;s at the same time among other things so i do need the 24gb  but i was wondering would the 12gb run better since its faster? (been think of getting 2x 12gb kits of ram but i dont think ill get the 2000mhz speed?)

anyway here is my list of components, any help or advice is welcomed!

<p>Isn’t it always the case that it’s a bad idea to buy X processor because the newer better one is “just around the corner”? There has to be literally less than 2-3 months a year in which you can buy a processor without someone going “oh you might as well wait for the newer one”. In reality it seems to me like a waste of time to wait.<br>

<p>No. Because this current chipset has been out for like, nearly three years now. It’s ending it’s life. It isn’t as if this individual line of CPUs Intel has gets refreshed every few months, it’s often much longer. They’ll add new CPUs to them, discontinue others, but they’ll keep this enthusiast/workstation level chipset out for a few years.</p>
<p>I agree with Spel, it’d be silly to buy into this individual platform now - it’s old.[/quote]</p>
<p>yeah its true, iv been looking around a bit more and the sandybridge-e is out in november. thats the new LGA2011. was thing of getting a i72600k and a board, until the new socket is out, after, its only a few months right!</p>

<p>Also, ram amount &gt; ram speed for what you want. The speed makes very little difference when it’s above 1ghz.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, and water cooling is PROBABLY a bad idea. There are plenty of fan solutions that are both cheaper and more silent.</p>

              <p>I understand the need for a lot of RAM as multiple VM’s obviously do need it, however I think that processor is a bit overkill, I’m sure the standard 980 is insanely fast as is the other i7 processors. You should think about getting the standard one as it is almost half the price… For the price of the cpu you’ve chosen you could even consider getting a hex core xeon such as:<br>

The lower clock speed means you’ll save elecricity but will still get performance!</p>
