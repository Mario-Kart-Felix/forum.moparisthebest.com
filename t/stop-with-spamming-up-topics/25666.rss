    <title>Stop with Spamming up Topics</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stop-with-spamming-up-topics/25666</link>
    <description>Ok Please Do Not Spam in this topic.

Last time i see soo many topics with over 300 posts fully spam,
Why you people do that?

I dont want any Reply like this first post:
[quote=&quot;mail`&quot;]Nice spam ass hole.[/quote]
P.S mail` , Sorry i know your one of the Spammers so i talk about you to, [u]Read the Rules Please![/u]

[b]1. Bumping, most people are bumping topics, why?[/b]

  1.) Its not allowed
  2.) Topic will be closed proberly or deleted
  3.) My Server Topic has in like in 2-3 hours 150 posts (I dont say name, i dont advertise), Many of this posts are 100% spam, questions, bumps.
  4.) If it isnt your topic and you bump it the topic gets a change to get closed, and the owner of the topic gets mad, because he didnt do anything and people keep bumping the topic
  5.) [u]Your Breaking the Rules[/u]

[b]2. Spamming, why?, everyone posts is the server on etc.[/b]

  Some examples: When the server will be on, if a server topic has 157 it has around 8-9 pages proberly,
  Im sure 6 of the pages are full of spam, like, only posting -.-, smileys, flamming, when the server will be on etc.
  And extra, your bumping the topic to, [u]so thats breaking rules[/u]
[b]
3. Questions, like i accept questions ofcourse, but some questions are stupid:[/b]
  Ok much servers has tons of pages, and many of them are full of questions, like:
   1.) When the server will be on?
   2.) What is the Ip?
   3.) Can i be mod?
   4.) Lots of more

Ofcourse i accept questions because i like answering them, but some questions are not needed, Example: What is the Ip?, soo many people are too lazy to watch the first page for the server information (Ip).
Can i be md questions are most of the time stupid, if you write in red glow letters and letter size 30 and say dont ask to become a mod/admin people keep asking it, ofcourse they didnt read the first page.
And ofcourse on the last, asking if the server is online: Ok most server owners are thinking the same about this proberly,
When you view any topic you will see on each page lots of is it on questions, my question is, why you just dont view it by yourself, maybe no one will reply and the server is online and you keep waiting for a reply, so first check if its online.
By the way, last time many people post topics like need a admin and asking to become one,
That topics get 100% spam topics so im thinking about it they arnt allowed.
Many new commers just see somewhere the word admin and directly posting il be admin, they didnt read the whole post.
Im sure many people did the same with this!

[b]What i am trying to do with this topic?[/b]
Ok, im trying to warn topic owners for the bumps,
Lots of people are new didnt read the rules.
So i tell some of them to.
And since other people gave me the idea:
Im trying to make this a empty topic pinned/sticky and ofcourse Closed.
Thank you for the idea&#39;s people.
So please Moparisthebest or Someone else,
Do something with this!

[b]P.S i made a Poll about this to vote, so please vote at it:
Vote: http://www.freewebs.com/godspk/nospam.htm[/b]



[b]Please do not flame in/about this topic.[/b]
Since i see many people flamming directly in it and got over 150 posts full of spam im sure many people are against this and love spamming,

1.) Spamming is Iritating
2.) Most people dont like it
3.) Topic Owners are leaving their topic, i did the same with the GodsPkz topic i ever made, too many spammers so i just say, leave this topic i stop with it.
4.) This is something else but i see many people are making topics about selling rs accounts, For the people!
Read the Rules its only allowed to sell scar scripts!! 
P.S Your posting 100% in the wrong section because this is the private server section

[b]But the good thing is,[/b]
Many people are voting yes in the poll over 100 people vote yes
And at the moment 3 vote no.

Voting Yes: This means you read the topic, hate spam, read the rules carefully
Voting No: This means you are one of the spammers, like to spam, never read the rules


If you can&#39;t find the Rules:
I think you can find becouse its already showwing months in the News:
