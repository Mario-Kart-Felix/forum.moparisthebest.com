    <title>Help me with Eclipse? [For a 100 error I received]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-with-eclipse-for-a-100-error-i-received/346366</link>
    <description>I have Eclipse Helios. I am new to this program so I&#39;m not very sure on what to do.
My friend said I have to debug my one .java so it can find the error, so when I click &quot;Debug&quot; it comes up with an error saying:

&quot;The section cannot be launched, and there are no previous launches&quot;

Anyone know how to work Eclipse, I&#39;d very much appreciate it!</description>
