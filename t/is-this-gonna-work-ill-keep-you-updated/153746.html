        <p>Hey,</p>
<pre><code> Well, I'm doing something different. It all started with a simple little question. After about 7 or 8 hours of me and my friends hanging out, and smoking weed, one of my friends asks, "Who wants some 'shrooms?". 'Shrooms I think, I don't know much about them. For those who don't know they are a psychedelic drug that grows mainly out of cow pies. In my county, in Florida (which I may add in is the only state in the US that is legal to posses WET 'shrooms.) there are a few fields where people can get them. There is a fairly moderate drug scene where I live, but mostly just weed, with the side of your party drugs like pills, but once in a while, you'll catch a 'shroom dealer, and they are valuable.

 I said yes to the question, I've read up a little bit and talked to friends, and 'shrooms don't really cause any bad effects, and are about as harmless as marijuana. My friend calls up a guy he knows, and finds out that 'shroom season is over, and that they only grow in summer. My luck right? Wrong, this lead me open to a window I'm glad I opened.

 After that, all my friends talked about their experiences on 'shrooms, me being the only person who hadn't tried them, listened, and loved about how they talked about how car seat belts and stoplights came alive to talk to them, and how they shared so much information with them.

 I went home and I studied them. I found out some very interesting things, like the fact that they are moderately easy to cultivate in your own home with some effort and devotion. When I first started looking at the information, words like substrate and inoculation were like Chinese to me. I think of myself to know my way around the English language, and I usually can pick up on any topic that people are having conversations about, simply because I'm knowledgeable and because I'm a social type of person. After about 3 visits to dictionary.com, I know what all these guides were talking about, and I had an idea that I knew would turn into a surefire way to get some cash.

 Obviously, no one in my area knows how to grow 'shrooms, or they would be a lot less cheaper than $40 for a quarter pound. Obviously no one knows how to preserve them, or there would be out of season dealers, but no. I get to make this little town a cash crop. I plan to grow 'shrooms. The idea of making them is really pretty simple after a few minutes of studying them, and sort of reminds me of pregnancy, and child growth. All you need is a substrate (think uterus) which in my growing procedure uses to very easy materials to get. Then you inoculate the substrate (impregnate) with the spore print of the type of mushroom you would like to grow. Then, you just let the mold take over the substrate, which isn't as easy as you sound. You need to make sure that everything is sterile, and that the spores you want are the only thing in the substrate, or you will die upon ingestion. Once the substrate is covered, you put it in a very humid place, which I will build called a teranium, or a growing chamber. After that, you need to keep humidity levels high, and C02 levels low, and you have a grade A Psychedelic Psilocybin Fungi which is ready for preservation and ingestion.

<p>This is where I will keep my log, as long as no one turns this into a flame fest, or a lock happy mod decides to close this, and not succeed see the scientific value of this. I will start with my first days from research (which I will call pre-growth days) to the time of my growths, in which the first generation of substrate has all died from loss of nutrients, after I get some 'shrooms off of them. I will try to post as many pictures and experiences as I can. Here goes.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=36pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Pre-Growth Logs</span>[/size]</span>[/center]<br>
Day 1; October 21, 2007: I have researched magic mushrooms non stop for about 36 hours. I know enough about them that I feel comfortable about growing them in my own home. I have talked to a few close friends, and all have agreed to be sellers for me once I have an inventory. I have produced a failsafe plan of being robbed by losers. There will be virtually no drug dealer. My seller will deliver the product, but place the product somewhere hidden near the buyers location, then ask for the money and tell them where the product is. I have yet to find a set price, and might not decide until I have tested the product for myself. I am in the middle of creating a full material and price list, and creating a way that my mom will not freak out when she opens a styrofoam container and finds mold growing. I have a sponsor, my friends brother, who I could also call my friend, has tons of cash, he has agreed to pay for the project, as long as I pay him back when I start selling. I think this has been a productive planning day.</p>
<p>Day 3; October 23, 2007: I have created a way that my mom will not freak out. After two different plans, one in which I just hide everything in my closet, and one in which I tell her it’s a school project. After some consideration I have decided I should tell her it’s a school project, and have created a school permission slip where she won’t know the difference. Click on the thumbnail below to view it.</p>

<p>I am still in the middle of working on a full price and material list, and hope to have everything ordered by sometime next week. Money is not really an object though.</p>
<p>Day 5; October 25, 2007: My friend’s brother has promised the money for the supplies on Friday. He is going to his father’s, and always comes back with $100-$200 because his father is an airline pilot, and he takes money from him anyways, so, all I’m doing is making sure about 80 of it doesn’t go to lubricant and pocket vaginas. I promise an entry when we order, I have completed my supply and price list, and I will be giving my mom the permission slip over the weekend, saying I forgot it over the week, because that is what I would normally do. All that is left to do now, is wait.</p>

        <p>I was supposed to be getting a couple on Friday, then I got fucked over.</p>
<p>Then I saw a few movies of people on shrooms and I realized how much I want to try them. Sadly I don’t know many people that have drugs so I decided to resort to my own methods. So I decided two days ago. I’ll fill you in on my progress as well, although my mom probably would not care so I wont have to worry about that one <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink1bce.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>My mom’s opinion on drugs is that I can’t come home high, although I can GET high here. Nothing over shrooms, that she knows about, but she wouldn’t be ok with me growing.

<p>Wow, I bet no-one else has thought of that failsafe drug-selling plan, great job coming up with an entirely new, fool-proof way to sell drugs!  :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Since this is the internet, it is possible you didn’t catch the heavy sarcasm in the last sentence.  That is a stupid idea and just as prone to getting robbed/caught as any other plan.  Grow them for yourself if you wish, selling them is a bad idea.</p>

I have produced a failsafe plan of being robbed by losers. There will be virtually no drug dealer. My seller will deliver the product, but place the product somewhere hidden near the buyers location, then ask for the money and tell them where the product is.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Wow, I bet no-one else has thought of that failsafe drug-selling plan, great job coming up with an entirely new, fool-proof way to sell drugs!  :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Since this is the internet, it is possible you didn’t catch the heavy sarcasm in the last sentence.  That is a stupid idea and just as prone to getting robbed/caught as any other plan.  Grow them for yourself if you wish, selling them is a bad idea.[/quote]<br>
True, but it’s a lot more unique then the things around here.</p>

Before this summer, I would have never have had to worry about people robbing people for drugs, but within the last few months, I’ve seen a few drug robberies. My friend wanted weed so he drove up, examined the weed in his car, and then drove off, and ended up getting a big rock through his back window. Can’t say I don’t blame the dealer. Then, about 3 weekends ago, I was at a party, and a kid there got 2 people to deliver, and when they pulled up, he pulled a fake gun (it was dark) and told them to give him their weed and money. This will help out with things like that. They can’t take what people don’t have.</p>

        <p>Like I said, you are selling to/hanging out with the wrong people. No amount of intricate planning is going to change that.</p>
<p>Personally, I would not sell illicit substances in any situation in which I felt uncomfortable enough to start thinking about how I was going to swap over, especially if I was mentioning guns, even fake ones. Dealing carries with it enough risks, without adding to them.</p>
