    <title>The mind of a Pessimist</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-mind-of-a-pessimist/337773</link>
    <description>A piece I wrote at school today.

The mind acts mutual with it&#39;s surroundings. The people find a profound essence in the simplest of things. We exasperate our use of these, and when the true entity is revealed in it&#39;s entirety, we question our establishments prior to this epiphany. A resolution bursts, yet revolution hurts. We&#39;re hazed with our own beliefs so often that we&#39;re oppressed by our own ignorance. We&#39;re incapable of breaching the epitome of the typical thought process. We contain ourselves so compact, we have nothing else to breath but the arrogance we frolic in. We&#39;re blinded by false perception, created by incompetence and misconception. We provoke through antagonistic corruption, and regress to our pawns that support us [i]oh so voluntarily[/i] under the same said power. A hierarchy collapses in the distance only to be regulated once again in an inefficient derivation, expelling the originality and beauty it once held. It becomes a game of plucking the flower, only to replace the pedals with an artificial emptiness.  The mind will often contemplate habit over choice and vice-versa, only to find that there is no real solution to perpetuation. We&#39;ve created a spectrum within society in which we [u]follow[/u], yet for what is acceptable, we build upon [u]nonconformity[/u]. Ironically, we manage to contradict ourselves for as long as we coexist -- coexist being the average social minds.

<p>I’d like to take the time, again, to explain the ignorance of this community. For one, we’ve allowed “whats your favorite drink” on here as well as other incredibly useless, trivial shit. Two, this isn’t “scary” at all. It’s a form of poetry, and I simply ask that you give your input on it. Three, there are probably only 10 people I could name out of the hundreds of active users that can tell me what this means/is.</p>

[/quote]Pessimists can be happy. My dad always thinks things will go wrong, and he is happy a lot too. But my point is that I think this more related to depression than pessimism.[/quote]You could subject this to a voice of depression. I wasn’t thinking depression when I wrote it though. If you look at it in a more broad perspective, I’d say it’s the thoughts of a pessimist. I only figure it this way because I planned on writing something optimistic as well.</p>
<p>[quote=“The Soul, post:6, topic:337773”]How can pessimists be happy? They’re always on the downside of things.[/quote]Being pessimistic is more of a way of looking at… things, for lack of a better word. They can have the same emotion as an optimist, they just have different views. My friend is a Debbie-downer about everything; telling me how much money I’m wasting on school lunches, how the skate spot is horrible, elaborating on how every phone sucks except for the iPhone… But he’s one of the happiest kids I know.</p>
