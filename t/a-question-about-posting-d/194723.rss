    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-question-about-posting-d/194723</link>
    <description>Can anyone tell me, where would i post a single part of a server, sorry im not sure what id call it, if i want to post JUST a minigame that i made but not the entire server? since the only thing i made was the minigame so i don&#39;t want people yelling at me saying the server is not my work.



EDIT:  Cmon, someone has to know! a mod or something!</description>
