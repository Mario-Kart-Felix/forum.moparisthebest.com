    <title>Database security, this work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/database-security-this-work/547319</link>
    <description>My idea is to setup my client server separate from my database server. Hiding the database from the internet, and hosting it on the same network as me. 

To communicate i would set up a basic protocol for requesting information from the database. (So all actual sql commands would be handled from within the database server computer)
REASON: protect the database from outside alterations, also removed need to send password to connect over the network. Also limits client caused corruption due to malicious commands.

There would be extensive validation at the start to verify if the connecting host was on the same network as my database. 
REASON: stop outside hosts from attempting to request information from the database.

Possibly use a reversible algorithm to encrypt protocol requests to(and from) the database. 
REASON: One extra step of security

Any packet that requires a string will be required to meet very specific rule-set about the information that can be sent in the string.
REASON: Added security for malicious queries.

Any other ideas that could make it more secure? I would appreciate them.</description>

EDIT: Looking at my post, it seems my wording may have been off. I did not mean a new separate database server for each type of operation. In the environments I’ve worked on, we would have a single database server that was setup to replicate across n servers. After that, we would have one database operation server, which was the only way of performing database operations, other than logging into the database server itself. That database operation server provides a set of web services for specific clients (web client which only retrieves some data, admin client that retrieves more data, and can perform some limited update operations on the server), and any number of other clients. Each of these services has a user account in the database. The database sets most of the rules about what sort of operations can be issued, based on the client and the issuer. The service also usually employs Windows Authentication through Active Directory, and that is secured on the transport level with certificates, and message level with Windows credentials. All of the above places I’ve listed, I have worked in an HBI position, working directly with databases that process data in terabytes/hour. I’m not sure if that’s the common convention, but in my experience, that has been the way it’s been implemented every single time. Sure, there are some slight differences, usually relating to load balancing and replication procedures, but they all have done overall the same thing, in the same way.<br>

<p>Xerox, Zones, Microsoft, Nordstrom, and Amazon all follow this methodology.</p>
<p>Also, I wasn’t speaking to it as a form of security, but rather a way to leverage SoC, and only expose specific API to those that can use it.</p>

<p>Exactly. With mysql you can create a user that doesn’t have drop permissions. You can cherry pick each command that you want it to be able to access, and nothing more. You can limit the list of IPs that the user can connect from, and it even supports TLS.</p>

<aside class="quote">

</aside>
<p>MySQL (and all other DB’s) already support this. You can a) have it only listen on internal IP’s and b) only allow a user to authenticate from those internal ranges, ie user ‘matzie’ cannot even login if he’s not on the network. So basically what you’re doing, except it already exists at the DB level.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Possibly use a reversible algorithm to encrypt protocol requests to(and from) the database.<br>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As above, already exists, and in a better way than you or I could implement it, probably. But I agree, definitely make use of it, especially if your DB stuff goes over the internet.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Any packet that requires a string will be required to meet very specific rule-set about the information that can be sent in the string.<br>
REASON: Added security for malicious queries.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Could you expand upon/clarify this one?[/quote]</p>
<blockquote>I disagree with this. There is already a protocol for this, you adding another layer doesn't really help anything. 'Limiting client caused corruption due to malicious commands' should be done by *not allowing* malicious commands - adding your extra protocol on the top actually just increases the attack surface and provides more places where you might have vulnerabilities that allow malicious stuff. As for not sending the password, this should be achieved by a) using an encrypted connection to the database server and/or b) using a private network between the database server and application server (ie. don't listen on internet routable IP's). Most DB's can also authenticate with a cert&amp;key, instead of a password.</blockquote>
The protocol would basically mean packets would be used to send only the information that changes in the query.
SELECT ban_status from users where username = 'namehere'
namehere would be the only thing sent over the network.
Thanks to lothy above, i would be using bound variables for it as well.
<p>As far as the validation goes, i would not want someone sending a drop table query through the add user packet.<br>
In reality, all of my tables will be above 2 characters in length, and having a string length limit of 12 will block those FTMP.</p>
<p>Also note, because someone is familiar with the MySQL connection protocol does not mean they would be familiar with mine. The concept i am trying to apply is security through selected abstraction.</p>
<p>The DB will still have the same securities as usual, but think of the protocol as the interface that only lets the game server talk to the DB. Nothing about the DB will be sent over the internet until it is interpreted by the game server. The protocol also does not allow the game server the ability to change its user/permissions. (So if it ever does get hacked, the DB is still separate, and it only grants the server read permissions)</p>
<p>I guess i should clarify, there still will be a SQL connection to perform the save operations. The purpose of the read protocol would also help with me to be able to queue statements and cut down on the network traffic.</p>

<p>As I said above. If your reading lists included material outside of this community (that is, material not exclusively about private servers and Runescape) then this stuff wouldn’t be so esoteric. Read a book.</p>

<p>Good. Do this.</p>
<p>[quote=“matzie, post:1, topic:547319”]To communicate i would set up a basic protocol for requesting information from the database. (So all actual sql commands would be handled from within the database server computer)<br>

<p>I disagree with this. There is already a protocol for this, you adding another layer doesn’t really help anything. ‘Limiting client caused corruption due to malicious commands’ should be done by <em>not allowing</em> malicious commands - adding your extra protocol on the top actually just increases the attack surface and provides more places where you might have vulnerabilities that allow malicious stuff. As for not sending the password, this should be achieved by a) using an encrypted connection to the database server and/or b) using a private network between the database server and application server (ie. don’t listen on internet routable IP’s). Most DB’s can also authenticate with a cert&amp;key, instead of a password.</p>
<p>[quote=“matzie, post:1, topic:547319”]There would be extensive validation at the start to verify if the connecting host was on the same network as my database.<br>
REASON: stop outside hosts from attempting to request information from the database.[/quote]</p>
<p>MySQL (and all other DB’s) already support this. You can a) have it only listen on internal IP’s and b) only allow a user to authenticate from those internal ranges, ie user ‘matzie’ cannot even login if he’s not on the network. So basically what you’re doing, except it already exists at the DB level.</p>
<p>[quote=“matzie, post:1, topic:547319”]Possibly use a reversible algorithm to encrypt protocol requests to(and from) the database.<br>
REASON: One extra step of security[/quote]</p>
<p>As above, already exists, and in a better way than you or I could implement it, probably. But I agree, definitely make use of it, especially if your DB stuff goes over the internet.</p>
<p>[quote=“matzie, post:1, topic:547319”]Any packet that requires a string will be required to meet very specific rule-set about the information that can be sent in the string.<br>

<p>Could you expand upon/clarify this one?</p>

<p>I can’t imagine the database server would be any more secure by running it on a separate server if you’re connecting with credentials that are stored in a configuration file somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don’t need extensive validation to determine if the host is from the same network. Just ensure that any connections made use end-to-end security (typically TLS) for making requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don’t need to have a reversible algorithm of your own. Configure the connection so that TLS is used for all traffic (including sending credentials to the database server for authentication) between the two servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use query binding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>None of this is rocket science. It wouldn’t be such a mystery if your reading went a little wider than the Moparscape forums.</p>
