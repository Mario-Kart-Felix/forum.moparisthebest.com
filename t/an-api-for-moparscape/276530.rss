    <title>An API for Moparscape?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-api-for-moparscape/276530</link>
    <description>Is there one?

I looked in the moparscape folder and did not find any documentation. If I am missing it, please tell me where it is? I mainly need this to understand everything I can do. I could just as well go up to everything in Eclipse and put a dot after it to see what methods it has, but I would much rather like some docs. I am new here so if I missed them, just point me in the right direction please. I already did a forum search for them, which returned nothing.

Oh, also, it&#39;s nice to be part of the group now! I look forward to programming this client.</description>
