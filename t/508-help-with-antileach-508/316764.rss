    <description>Does anyone know how to remove the anti leech to synestia? Apparently it&#39;s in the playercombat.java. It probably has something to do with PvN Because you need to attack an npc then your able to attack a player. The anti leech is preventing people from attack people at pvp and i would like to fix this. If anyone knows PLEASE post how!
