    <description>Yeah, i was reading SilentCJ&#39;s modeling tut (which rocks) and since the update I have no idea how to get the models now. Anybody help? the current cache number is 622, but when it says accepted, it says 
sending request for model: 1
Model grabbing complete
blah blah the address which the files are supposed to be in
press any key to continue...

this is with the rsmv btw.
Edit: the problem is it doesnt work now, lol sorry for not saying that before</description>

              <p>Apologies, i should have been more clear. My issue is they’re not.</p>
<p>Or are they not necessary to make customs? I love customs and i really want to start modelling, and i have this idea for a really killer kick-ass bow.<br>
OR again can somebody post a dl link for models?</p>
<p>thx.</p>
