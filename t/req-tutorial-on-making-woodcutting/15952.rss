    <description>Yes, i know its fairly easy but I dont know, My woodcutting codes is all messed up, either it doesnt woodcut, or just looses weapons. (I made one for testscape and cheeze 78, they worked, for cheeze 80 they worked, but than with P16 V6 is giving me a hard time :s

Can any one make a TUT for P16 V.6?
