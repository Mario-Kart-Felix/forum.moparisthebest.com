    <description>Here&#39;s a problem I&#39;ve NEVER ran into before:

While trying to create a &#39;fun PK&#39; area, I added a teleport to the area. Problem is, people in this area don&#39;t seem to be updating. They&#39;re &#39;invisible&#39;, and can usually only see you if they teleported to the area after you; but you can&#39;t see them. They can attack you, but obviously when they&#39;re invisible you can&#39;t attack back.

Any ideas why this would be happening?</description>
