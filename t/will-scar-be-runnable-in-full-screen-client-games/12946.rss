<p>Yes if the image NEVER changes, else you would need a ridiculous amount of tolerance, thus slowing finding down, and you could only do it on images that don’t move, FindDeformedBitmap is ridiculously slow.[/quote]<br>
Damn it, because my image moves. Grrrr, if only there were a way how to do this.<br>
I think the FindColour function but there is so much of that colour in the game called Freelancer at the Main Menu.</p>

<p>yes very true, it can be used on world of warcraft for simple tasks, however the graphical content of warcraft makes it allmost inpossible to create any working script, however i have been led to beleive that it might, just might be possble.</p>

              <p>If I remember correctly, it has something to do with the constant small adjustments DirectX makes to compensate for angles, lighting, blending <span class="bbcode-i">et cetera</span> versus the single-color simplicity of RuneScape Classic, which SCAR was designed for. Of course, SCAR scripting (and SCAR itself) has come a long way since then…</p>

              <p>Hmm… I tested SCAR with FATE. ClickMouse didn’t work for it[I think lag caused it], but, HoldMouse + ReleaseMouse did. …and in the system requirements there is:</p>
<p><code>- DirectX version 8.0 or above</code> So, I guess some commands DO work for DirectX based games. I just tryed clicking and detecting features, and both worked. Didn’t try sending any text to FATE, though.</p>
<p>Edit: Okay. Now it is DAMN sure SCAR works with DirectX. I have been making many many scripts for one game. The system requirements of the game are:</p>
<p><code>System requierments:
Intel Pentium 3 1Gz , 256Mb RAM , 16Mb videocard like GForce MX4
Direct X 8.0</code> and I have used alot of SCAR’s commands for the scripts. And so far, only silent features haven’t been working for it.</p>
<p>Only if the game has somekind of protection too, then it wont work. Else it works nicely for DirectX too.</p>
<p>The game is: <a href="http://shadow-worlds.net/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Shadow Worlds</a></p>
