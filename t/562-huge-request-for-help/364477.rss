    <title>[562] Huge request for help</title>

    <description>I am wanting to make it so that the Player.java file make certain ints (i&#39;ve got that part done) but I need to know how to add strings also.

Now I also need it so players (and staff) can type in commands to edit those ints and strings and get it saved to their account.

The last thing I need is a command similar to a MUCK, lookat command where you look at the player typing ::lookat player to see their details (ints and strings)

This is so a player can set their own description and the other players can view it


Anyone have any ideas</description>
