    <title>Cockiness Of Some People</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cockiness-of-some-people/332788</link>
    <description>Well, cocky people are really something that grind my gears. Rather than directly insulting them and just dragging something on that&#39;s not wanted, I thought we could harmlessly, as a whole, show them being cocky and showing off doesn&#39;t really do anything but piss people off. A good example of this is TimeTM, as just about EVERY one of his posts show his over-obsession with himself and his work. I&#39;m not just trashing you in public TimeTM, but you&#39;re just a great example of a true cocky person.

The purpose of this is to make them realize showing off doesn&#39;t make them look cool, or get them any extra respect. In fact, it actually hurts their reputation but they are too blind and ignorant to see it.

So what are your views on it? Be sure to vote [size=3pt]Option 2[/size]!</description>

Why would you make this thread just curious?</p>
<p>Trust me just because you call someone cocky, doesn’t mean they will stop <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>80% of the cocky people are just yesmen, following someone who’s brave enough to be an asshole in the beginning. This thread for example: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,429239.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,429239.0.html</a></p>
<p>It’s irritating to see the same fucking post over and over again “We don’t care”, just report the thread. If you don’t care that he’s leaving then why do you have to mediate it across the whole forum? I for one am going to miss our homosexual minority, because at least he was honest. Everyone else in the community is playing the roll of the typical “kid behind a screen”.</p>
<p>If you’re not exceedingly inclined in whatever it is you’re talking about, don’t intend to make people think you are. Chances are, there is someone that knows more about it than you, and you’re just setting yourself up to look like an idiot. You’re ability to sustain against criticism isn’t anything to be proud of either. If someone says they don’t like your work, or that there’s a flaw in it, take it for advice. Don’t lash back and flaunt your skills (or lack of for that matter) in order to prove yourself otherwise.</p>
<p>Cockiness is rather a retardation in this community, as it isn’t even fulfilled. I could understand someone being cocky and honest, but most of the users that are cocky are lying most of the time.[/quote]&lt;3<br>
I r cocky.<br>

<p>Personally I despise people that toot their own horn, or whine when other people don’t appreciate their work. “WHY DIDN’T I WIN THE SCYTHE COMPETITION??? MINE WAS SO MUCH BETTER” - MistaBigBoss</p>
<p>Unfortunately the winner caved in and gave MBB his reward, just so he would shut up.</p>

<p>The purpose of this is to make them realize showing off doesn’t make them look cool, or get them any extra respect. In fact, it actually hurts their reputation but they are too blind and ignorant to see it.</p>

<p>80% of the cocky people are just yesmen, following someone who’s brave enough to be an asshole in the beginning. This thread for example: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,429239.0.html">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,429239.0.html</a></p>
<p>It’s irritating to see the same fucking post over and over again “We don’t care”, just report the thread. If you don’t care that he’s leaving then why do you have to mediate it across the whole forum? I for one am going to miss our homosexual minority, because at least he was honest. Everyone else in the community is playing the roll of the typical “kid behind a screen”.</p>
<p>If you’re not exceedingly inclined in whatever it is you’re talking about, don’t intend to make people think you are. Chances are, there is someone that knows more about it than you, and you’re just setting yourself up to look like an idiot. You’re ability to sustain against criticism isn’t anything to be proud of either. If someone says they don’t like your work, or that there’s a flaw in it, take it for advice. Don’t lash back and flaunt your skills (or lack of for that matter) in order to prove yourself otherwise.</p>
<p>Cockiness is rather a retardation in this community, as it isn’t even fulfilled. I could understand someone being cocky and honest, but most of the users that are cocky are lying most of the time.</p>
