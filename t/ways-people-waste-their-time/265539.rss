    <title>Ways people waste their time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ways-people-waste-their-time/265539</link>
    <description>I have been thinking alot recently about why there are issues in in the world that have been around for awhile, that many people want to solve, and that go unresolved. Part of this has to do with people who live their whole lives and never accomplish anything worthwhile. 

I&#39;ve observed that, in most people&#39;s free time, they have some particular activity or set of activities that does nothing but waste time. The defining characteristic of this activity are [b]it&#39;s aimless, and you could do it forever without ever making progress[/b]. So, if you watched a documentary on TV on yesterday and then did something else when it was done, don&#39;t count that in this list. If you were browsing a forum and aimlessly reading whatever interesting topic you happened to come across, then that would count.

Something interesting a friend of mine pointed out to me: In general, the time wasting activity is related to the generation of the person doing it, because they grew up in its time. For example, my father and grandmother (In his 60&#39;s and in her 80&#39;s) both watch TV. The people at my campus, mostly in their teens, waste time on forums and sites like facebook.</description>

I don’t really waste any of my time, I only use these forums to fill in gaps, seeing as I train nearly all day everyday, I just use the forums/msn/internet as a relaxation.<br>

<p>Are you still making progress/coming closer to completing your training? Because if not that’s a waste right there.[/quote]<br>
Ofcourse I’m making progess, each training session brings you closer to your goal. At the moment my goal is to get my 5th stripe on my green belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, I still have about a month at this rate (2 sessions every day). But, once I achieve that, my next goal is probably to get a good mental composure for an up and coming event.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you lower your stress and improve your health, but then you don’t do anything different, what was the point?</p>
<p>Relaxation is a complex subject. I’ve seen alot of people tell other people they need to relax. But in my mind, I think of the “most relaxed person in the world”. He sits there, inert, unresponsive, and never moves a muscle. I think it’s not about relaxing, but figuring out how to use your effort in the best way.</p>

i like to write computer programs</p>
<p>and reading</p>
<p>i dont think any of those are wasteful, but thats what i do in my spare time.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, I don’t think those are wasteful either; but let me be specific. When you write the program, you finish at some point, and you’re done at some point, right? And then you put it to use, right? If so, then it was worth it. Basically, there is some sort of measurable progress.</p>
<p>The books you read, do you remember things from them? Do you learn from them? Or do you just read it, and a few months later you have forgotten entirely what it was about. The latter I would consider a waste of time.[/quote]</p>
<p>i almost never put these programs to any use, normally they sit in my java/c/lisp directory until i feel the need read their source again, perhaps to admire the logic or something.<br>
also, sometimes they are enjoyable to look at, especially if its a graphical program.</p>
<p>i think i make programs for the hell of it.</p>
<p>you know humans did that before they were fully human? (like between apes and human)<br>
archaeologists have found sites where they dig up hundreds of stone blades. Not all the blades could be said to be useful, in fact some of the blades would take two people to lift and are absolutly useless for hunting or whatever you use stone blades for.</p>
<p>we know the blades are made by a certain kind of early human because we’ve found matching blades with some of their remains.</p>
<p>but in these particlar sites, there are no human bones, it seems the humans went somewhere else to die.</p>
<p>what this clearly points to is that early humans enjoyed making stone blades, they seemed to make them just for the hell of it.</p>
<p>(i got this fact from a book called A Short History Of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson)</p>
<p>as for reading books, i wouldnt say i remember from them, but i definatly learn.<br>
ill have you know i almost never read purely fiction books, theres that Bill Bryson i’ve already mentioned, and generally books like that.</p>
<p>one pretty cool book i found on a dusty shelf on my school library, it hadnt been taken out for 20 years and didnt even have the magnetic security strip (so i stole it).<br>
it was “The quest for absolute zero” by Kurt Mendelssohn. googling the guy i found he was around at the time when helium was first liquified and was heavily involved in cyrogenics, so who better to write a book on low tempratures?</p>
<p>also, couldnt you say almost everything is worthwhile, if it lowers your stress or makes you more relaxed and somehow improves your health, isnt that worthwhile?</p>

<p>My definition of “worthwhile” isn’t quite sorted out yet. But do you have any dreams, projects, whatevr in the back of your head that you’ve thought about doing, but not gotten around to yet? This is the kind of thing I am talking about.</p>

              <p>I have been thinking alot recently about why there are issues in in the world that have been around for awhile, that many people want to solve, and that go unresolved. Part of this has to do with people who live their whole lives and never accomplish anything worthwhile.</p>
<p>I’ve observed that, in most people’s free time, they have some particular activity or set of activities that does nothing but waste time. The defining characteristic of this activity are <span class="bbcode-b">it’s aimless, and you could do it forever without ever making progress</span>. So, if you watched a documentary on TV on yesterday and then did something else when it was done, don’t count that in this list. If you were browsing a forum and aimlessly reading whatever interesting topic you happened to come across, then that would count.</p>
<p>Something interesting a friend of mine pointed out to me: In general, the time wasting activity is related to the generation of the person doing it, because they grew up in its time. For example, my father and grandmother (In his 60’s and in her 80’s) both watch TV. The people at my campus, mostly in their teens, waste time on forums and sites like facebook.</p>
