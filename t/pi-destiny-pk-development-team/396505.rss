[code]I am using Project Insanity based source with LOADS of editing, DSPK client again with LOADS of editing and some amazing items!
[/code]

Trailer Video of my PI project so far (was a few days ago since then I added a lot more!)
[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK_Lgfh_p2k]Click here for the video![/url]

Since that video I have added the following:
All 4 coloured whips (they look almost the same as RS&#39;s)
New summoning base which will be developed into a skill!
FULLY working Korasi&#39;s sword with spec!
Ancient ceremonial robes and pernix stuff!
Started working on a dungeoneering minigame (I&#39;ll go into more detail when its nearly finished :) )
Fixed a MAJOR cache bug which was stopping things from loading and freezing the client :)

Things to do or maybe:
Add nex? (Maybe...)
Add 508 maps (E.g. Edgeville map update...) (Maybe...)
Working on a dungeoneering minigame as stated above :)
Adding WORKING beast of burden. (Takes the piss to do because I&#39;m a horrible client developer :roll: )


I hope to see a lot of PMs and Replies :D
