    <title>Server disconnects upon interaction, Please help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-disconnects-upon-interaction-please-help/291637</link>
    <description>I have tried many clients, and I have the same problem with all of them. After logging in to an account, after logging into a server, I am able to interact with one object (e.g. the bank, walk here, trade, etc.), but upon a second interaction, the client crashes and X&#39;s out immediately. I tried searching around a bit, but I was not able to find anything. My first thought was that it must be a firewall problem, but on any other computer in the house, it works fine. Any help you can offer would be great!

P.S. I am running 64bit windows 7, but I had the exact same problem with my previous installation of 64bit windows vista.

Thanks,
-Norec</description>
