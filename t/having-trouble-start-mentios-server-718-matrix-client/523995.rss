    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/having-trouble-start-mentios-server-718-matrix-client/523995</link>
    <description>I tried to start the Mentios Server and I get the following error: 
[IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/2hx9ev7.jpg[/img]
I have downloaded Mentios from this link: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,638261.0.html
The problem was that the client link was not found but I allready had a Matrix 718 client from previous servers. I went to another website and got the matrix 718 cache and put it in my C:/ drive and under my files under my acccount on my pc. Still having no luck with this source and I really want to try it out. Can someone plaese help me get Mentios 718/742 working. Or even send me a new link to the client and cache? Thanks!</description>
