    <description>I have been looking all around Moparscape and other rsps sites and have found very little of what I am looking for. In my opinion, 2008 or so was the best time in Runescape history. I am looking for a server with the Grand Exchange, all the skills, and most if not all quests working. I really liked working hard for my levels so the regular experience rate would be preferable, but a bit faster exp couldn&#39;t hurt. I am looking for a well tested and bug-fixed 2008 experience. I never really found PKing very fun or interesting, and all these servers where you jump to level 23 after 1 damage is ridiculous. Also, new monsters and dungeons, or even new skills would be very fun and enjoyable. This is what I am looking for, and if anyone has found a server like this please let me know. Feel free to take any ideas and please, add your own fun and interesting ideas to it to make it unique.
Thanks a bunch,

              <p>For anyone to post a server in this thread would count as advertising. Try looking through the server status page or our advertisements board, and if you can’t find one then it means our site doesn’t have that sort of server to offer.</p>
