    <description>Alright guys,

So I finally have my server set up, hoping that I could have people log into it... However when my friend tried to log into it, it got stuck at Updating Server, and gave him an error message saying &quot;Error_game_js5connect&#39;&#39;. Now I know that this means that my server is not online, but on in my server box it says it is receiving the connection...

I&#39;m not quite sure what is wrong. When I open up No-IP all of my IP&#39;s have smiling blushing faces beside them, which is what they are suppose to have. So everyone should be running fine...

If anyone could please help me out, please post below. I do have teamviewer if anybody thinks they can help that way too.
Greatly appreciated :) Thanks!</description>
