    <title>Include File Errors. READ HERE IF YOU HAVE THESE ERRORS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/include-file-errors-read-here-if-you-have-these-errors/82319</link>
    <description>First of all, i would like this as a sticky as these are common errors that people will now know how to fix. After reading at least 5 posts about this issue and am tired of post &quot;Do you have SRL Installed?&quot;. So please sticky.

Now most people have come up with these errors and there is a fix for this issue. And these errors are:
[code]Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 3.0\includes\srl\srl\skill\Cooking.scar does not exist.
Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 3.0\includes\srl\srl\skill\Crafting.scar does not exist.
Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 3.0\includes\srl\srl\skill\Firemaking.scar does not exist.
Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 3.0\includes\srl\srl\skill\Fishing.scar does not exist.

Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 3.0\includes\srl\srl\skill\Fighting.scar does not exist.[/code]

And to fix this error you have to Download SRL. You can download SRL from [url=http://www.srl-forums.com/forum/offical-srl-download-t3410.html?t=3410]here[/url]. Follow the instructions/step-by-step guide to download and install your latest SRL. Also, the SRL do not contain viruses, spyware or malicous software.

<p>Im afraid you don’t make the choice about it being stickied or not, and also there is already a sticky about getting includes…</p>

But that could just be to tell people to get SRL. Same as this i know but some people might think, oh well. But this is showing what happens if you do not have SRL included and you come up with these errors.</p>
