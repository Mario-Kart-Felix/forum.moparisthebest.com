              <p>It is not possible to get the exact algorithm used for calculating hits on real Classic without seeing it for yourself; the best to hope for is something near enough to be considered suitable by the general mass of players.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, no matter if you had the very exact formula as Classic had, the players would NOT be satisfied if you withheld that information and would still ask you to make it more like Classics.  The mind is a powerful thing.</p>

<p>[quote=“object, post:22, topic:415402”]Edit: I have now optimized the formula a bit. It may aswell seem more realistic. I havn’t tested it a lot, but to me, this optimized solution seems more logical. It has a bit less code aswell. Anyway, here it is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/**
 * Add Potion and Prayer multipliers to Attack-, Defence- and Strength-levels like this:
 * private static final int YOUR_ATTACK_LEVEL = 99 + (99 * 0.2D) + (99 * 0.1D);
 */
public final class Combat {
     private static final int YOUR_ATTACK_LEVEL = 99;
     private static final int YOUR_DEFENCE_LEVEL = 99;
     private static final int YOUR_STRENGTH_LEVEL = 99;
     private static final int YOUR_HITS_LEVEL = 99;
     private static final int YOUR_AIM = 81;
     private static final int YOUR_ARMOUR = 200;
     private static final int YOUR_POWER = 81;
     private static final int YOUR_OPPONENTS_ATTACK_LEVEL = 99;
     private static final int YOUR_OPPONENTS_DEFENCE_LEVEL = 99;
     private static final int YOUR_OPPONENTS_STRENGTH_LEVEL = 99;
     private static final int YOUR_OPPONENTS_HITS_LEVEL = 99;
     private static final int YOUR_OPPONENTS_AIM = 81;
     private static final int YOUR_OPPONENTS_ARMOUR = 200;
     private static final int YOUR_OPPONENTS_POWER = 81;
     private static final int[] FIGHT_MODES = {1, 3, 0, 0};
     private int yourHits = YOUR_HITS_LEVEL;
     private int yourOpponentsHits = YOUR_OPPONENTS_HITS_LEVEL;
     
     private Combat() {
          
     }
     
     private void simulate() {
          while(yourHits &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; yourOpponentsHits &gt; 0) {
               System.out.println("You hit " + getYourNextHit() + " on your opponent! Your opponent now has " + yourOpponentsHits + " Hits left.");
               if(yourOpponentsHits &lt;= 0) {
                    break;
               }
               System.out.println("Your opponent hits " + getYourOpponentsNextHit() + " on you! You now have " + yourHits + " Hits left.");
          }
     }
     
     private int getYourNextHit() {
          return yourOpponentsHits - (yourOpponentsHits -= getNextHit(YOUR_STRENGTH_LEVEL, YOUR_POWER, YOUR_ATTACK_LEVEL, YOUR_AIM, YOUR_OPPONENTS_DEFENCE_LEVEL, YOUR_OPPONENTS_ARMOUR));
     }
     
     private int getYourOpponentsNextHit() {
          return yourHits - (yourHits -= getNextHit(YOUR_OPPONENTS_STRENGTH_LEVEL, YOUR_OPPONENTS_POWER, YOUR_OPPONENTS_ATTACK_LEVEL, YOUR_OPPONENTS_AIM, YOUR_DEFENCE_LEVEL, YOUR_ARMOUR));
     }
     
     private int getNextHit(int strength, int power, int attack, int aim, int defence, int armour) {
          return isNextHitValid(attack, aim, defence, armour) ? (int)(Math.random() * getMaxHit(strength, power)) : 0;
     }
     
     private int getMaxHit(int strength, int power) {
          return (int)Math.ceil(((strength) + FIGHT_MODES[0]) * ((power * 0.00175) + 0.1) + 1.05);
     }
     
     private boolean isNextHitValid(int attack, int aim, int defence, int armour) {

     }
     
     public static void main(String[] args) {
          new Combat().simulate();
     }
}</code></pre>
<p>Edit: Now I have some form of clarification of the process. I didn’t create an image, though, but I hope a text document will do. Here it is:</p>
<p>[code]<br>
 = …<br>
 = …<br>
 = …<br>
 += ( * )<br>
 += ( * )<br>
 = …</p>
<p> = …<br>
 = …<br>
 = …<br>
 += ( * )<br>
 += ( * )<br>
 = …</p>
<p> = (( +  +  + ) / 100)<br>
 = ( + ) / <br>
 = ( + ) / <br>
 = &lt;0…99&gt;</p>
<p>[00][01][02][03][04][05][06][07][08][09]<br>
[10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]<br>
[20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29]<br>
[30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39]<br>
[40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49]<br>
[50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59]<br>
[60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69]<br>
[70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79]<br>
[80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89]<br>
[90][91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98][99]</p>
<p>IF  &lt;= <br>
 = TRUE<br>
ELSE<br>
 = FALSE</p>
<p>Clarification:</p>
<p>The matrix will be divided percentually correct based on one players statistics compared to another players statistics.<br>
Two players with exact equal statistics, will have the same amount of positions in the matrix. There are 100 positions<br>
in the matrix - 1 per percent. The initial positions will be handed over to the attacker at all times. The more of the<br>
positions the attacker gets, the higher chance he has to hit. The less positions the attacker gets, the less chance he<br>
has to hit. The random number is as random as the built-in PRNG can produce.</p>
<p>If a hit is successful, the default calculation of hitting is done. This may, or may not (depending on who writes the<br>
code), produce a hit of 0. Some people perhaps prefers to keep a successful hit at 1 as a minimum, others perhaps wants<br>
a 0 as the minimum of a successful hit.<br>
