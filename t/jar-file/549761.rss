    <description>hi, you see i got a problem. I&#39;m abit new to this rsps thing. But lets get to the main thing. i&#39;ve been trying to get my rsps online for 2 days now. I&#39;m done with the portforwarding i think, but when other people tries to join it says &quot;Error Loading.... Contact staff!&quot; and i have no clue why this is happening. I&#39;ve been following all kinds of tutorials and i have no idea why this is happening. Been trying to google around a bit too and haven&#39;t find anything about this. So i thought why not give it a shot here. Thanks!</description>
