    <title>Setting Server to Require my Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-server-to-require-my-client/346837</link>
    <description>I am pretty sure this is both Server/Client sided so, not sure which section this goes into.

I have tried a few TUTs on this, but none of them have seemed to work.
If someone could please help me, that would be fantastic.  I have already, like I said, tried to figure this out, but haven&#39;t managed.
Oh, and yes, I did use the Search Tab and Google.</description>
