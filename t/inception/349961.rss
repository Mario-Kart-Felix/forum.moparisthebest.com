    <description>Anyone seen it?

I thought it was a pretty epic movie. Great plot, soundtrack, and an ending which got me thinking a lot.</description>

I think he was in the dream ever since he went into that place where he talked to the drug dude, and tested “The new stable drug”. Remember when he was about to spin the top and was washing his face? He never remembered to spin the top to make sure he was in reality, ya know?</p>

              <p>yeah great film, at first I thought the ending was reality, but after thinking about the fact that the totem never stopped spinning and that his kids had not aged since his last memory of them, the fact that they were wearing the same clothes in the same spot etc etc makes me believe that its quite possible that he believes he is in reality when really he is in a dream, designed from memories. Whether this is limbo or not I am not sure, perhaps not limbo, I think the idea is that in limbo you do not know you are in limbo because you can’t remember what happened, with that in mind and the fact that the guy he was working for (forgot his name) reminded him, it is possible they got out of limbo but not completely out of the dream. Im not too sure, although I think there is more evidence for the ending to be a dream than reality, despite first thoughts.</p>

<p>It was very good, although a bit complex to comprehend at first. I found the movie to be a lot like Leonardo DiCaprio’s last movie, Shutter Island, with the tragedy concerning his wife and the double ending. I definitely have to see it one more time to get a more thorough grasp on the movie, since I feel I missed a few key components.</p>
