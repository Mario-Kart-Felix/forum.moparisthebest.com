    <title>What should I do with this acc?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-should-i-do-with-this-acc/313028</link>
    <description>I just found an old file with some user names and passwords on and found this acc. I decided that I wanted to do something with it, but don&#39;t know where to go or what quests to do with the stats. If I can, I would like to make it a good member/f2p pker, but seeing as I&#39;ve been out of the RS scene for a couple of years now, I don&#39;t know what is necessary to be good.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should train/where I should train/what should I aim for?

              <p>No need for 52 prayer anymore – smite is effectively useless for acquiring the player’s one item now that you either lose or keep the item based on the world you use.</p>
<p>If you’re going to be a f2p pker, then simply do the maths with regards to the prayer level.<br>
At 80 strength, the 15% bonus will add 12 strength points to your level <span class="bbcode-u">while active</span>.<br>
If you’re quite happy to recharge your prayer by visiting the monks then so be it.</p>
<p>However 31 prayer levels is 3 (nearly 4) combat levels. So you could just get 90 strength and higher range in lieu of it. Same damage, but you never have to recharge prayer.<br>
Really boils down to whether or not you’re prepared to acquire 6.5 million strength xp as opposed to roughly 2 million. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>All of that aside, the game is absolutely shit in the PvP department.</p>

<p>Are maulers still good these days? I was thinking stats along the lines of:<br>
<span class="bbcode-s">70 att</span><br>
80+ str<br>
1 def<br>
<span class="bbcode-s">52 pray? or 1 pray?</span><br>

<span class="bbcode-s">mage 1 or mage 70+?</span>[/quote]<br>
Maulers rape ftp and p2p.</p>
<p>Fuck mage.<br>
Prayer is 31.<br>
50/51 Attack<br>
80 str+<br>
70 Range+</p>
<p>These stats own ftp and p2p.</p>
<p>Also, personally I think getting 1k snapes would be faster then getting 1k yews. And same amount of money.</p>

              <p>Uhh, this is a good starters account indeed, just from the wc level.</p>
<p>I would say get members as soon as possible and start collecting snape grass.<br>
[The prices have gone up tremendously]<br>
Don’t be a douche and sell them on low because that will then start lowering the price.</p>
<p>1k Snapes is 1.5 hrs, which means you’ll get 450k. Get enough for 1mil and have that ready.</p>
<p>Then get your wc level to 80 and cut magic trees.</p>
<p>After you have some money [5mil ~] start raising your pking stats.<br>
50attk/80str = great mauler</p>
<p>And go on from there</p>
<p>Edit: Get range up as well [Just buy range off with a cannon machiene at rock crabs]</p>
