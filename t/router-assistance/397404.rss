    <description>Alright, I&#39;m having a hard time with NETGEAR customer support because we don&#39;t have warranty, and frankly don&#39;t have a card to hand to them, so we can&#39;t get customer support.

So I&#39;m having a problem with the router, and it seems to be not sending out Wi-Fi signals to like the Xbox, Labtop etc., and I&#39;ve tried a lot of things to see if it would work but seems to not be working...

So does someone have a suggestion?</description>

Yeah, I just fixed the stupid problem and that’s exactly what I had to do plus a power cycle. I’ve lost all my stuff such as passwords and stuff connected with the Router, but hey, I at least fixed it.</p>
