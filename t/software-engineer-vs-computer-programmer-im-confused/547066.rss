    <title>Software Engineer vs. Computer Programmer, I&#39;m Confused</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/software-engineer-vs-computer-programmer-im-confused/547066</link>
    <description>Alright, so I was under the assumption for quite some time now that a software engineer was just a fancy name for somebody who develops programs, but after further research I have discovered that this is not exactly the case. At [url=http://work.chron.com/differences-between-software-engineer-computer-programmer-7587.html]this[/url] link, it says &lt;blockquote&gt;Software engineers, often called software developers, plan and create programs. They analyze user needs, design software and then test it to ensure quality. They give instructions to programmers who write the software codes. Engineers who specialize in the operating systems needed by computers are called systems software developers. Those who focus on applications, such as games, video editors, word processors and databases, are called applications software developers. They require a minimum bachelor’s degree in software engineering, computer science or a related field. Though they do not usually write code, they also need strong programming skills to communicate properly with programmers.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Which doesn&#39;t sound accurate in any way, obviously not written by somebody of either trade, then this [url=https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071020191123AA0UHz8]Yahoo Answers[/url] link goes on to try to further explain the difference, but I&#39;m afraid I still can&#39;t make much sense out of it.

From what sense I can make out of what I&#39;ve read, it seems like software engineers are either (a) The persons who develop the virtual machines and programming frameworks and what not, i.e. .NET and Java itself, or (b) The persons who mainly deal in developing base API&#39;s for companies so that developers can utilize them for their tasks. Anybody care to shed light on this for me?</description>

              <p>There’s a story behind software engineering. Software development as a profession has an awful reputation. Statistically speaking most projects fail - they go over budget, they run over deadlines, or the software isn’t fit for purpose.<br>
The idea with software engineering is that it’s supposed to add engineering rigour to the software development process, thereby mitigating these failures.</p>
<p>Has it worked though? Not really.</p>

True. I guess I would rather take more of a leadership position by setting a overall design to work from while overseeing the project…</p>

              <p>Yz85Racer: By that you’re probably referring to either a project leader or a systems architect. Not that it really matters, though, as a project leader of one project may very well be able to take the role as a systems developer of another project. In other cases there’s no difference at all, and everyone can take the role as anything. That’s usually the case if the company doesn’t have that many employees, like smaller companies.</p>
<p>I have worked for six companies so far. One of them with around 800 employees, whereas the others were pretty small ones. As of yet, only one of those companies had a systems architect (not the large company). We also used Scrum there, so he was also the Scrum Master. On the company where I work now, we have a project leader whom barely write any code for the project that he leads. Although he is a systems developer in other projects, so he does write more code than that.</p>

<p>On my CV I have more than ten projects listed. You don’t even have to add a lot of information about each project. The reason is that the people recruiting oftentimes don’t even understand what you’re writing. They believe you based on your “advanced” descriptions. Maybe you’ve used a “buzz” word that they’ve heard before.</p>

              <p>That sounds fairly accurate. obv usage varies depending on who you talk to, and what bullshit titles organisations come up with for their devs… but this is my general interpretation:</p>
<p>Programmer - someone who writes code, whether it be assembly or javascript. may or may not get involved with high level design.</p>
<p>Software engineer - a programmer who follows standard software engineering methodologies, uses good design patterns etc.</p>
<p>so a software engineer could write system code (bash scripts, C, etc), they could build applications, APIs, etc, doesn’t really matter imo</p>
