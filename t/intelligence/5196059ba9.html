<p>Huh? If you’re implying that a savant would think I was wrong I would like to see what evidence we have to suggest that natural ability really does exist; if we define natural ability as that which is inherited in terms of physical composition i’m more inclined to agree with you but in respect to cognition unless i’m mistaken there’s no ‘empirical’ proof that intelligence is inherited, and I don’t see how it could be really. It seems much more plausible to me that one could play the piano without playing it before well not because of nature but because they can apply similar methodology (for instance mathematics and knowledge of similar instruments).</p>

<p>This is the intelligent debate section, if you think my post is garbage ignore it, you’re just using that as an excuse because your argument was weak and you’ve been caught out. What about it was garbage, can you not comprehend it?[/quote]<br>

<p>Huh? If you’re implying that a savant would think I was wrong I would like to see what evidence we have to suggest that natural ability really does exist; if we define natural ability as that which is inherited in terms of physical composition i’m more inclined to agree with you but in respect to cognition unless i’m mistaken there’s no ‘empirical’ proof that intelligence is inherited, and I don’t see how it could be really. It seems much more plausible to me that one could play the piano without playing it before well not because of nature but because they can apply similar methodology (for instance mathematics and knowledge of similar instruments).</p>

I’m not sure if you missed his point or if he should of said prodigy. Or perhaps people with autism that are considered savants, as that would be maybe not necessarily inherited, but definitely a genetic deformity (again, not sure on my exact wording here with autism). What I believe he is saying is that people seem to either develop innate abilities at extremely young ages that would seem impossible to have developed a skillset to do such activities. You can look at any prodigy and see this. For example Mozart started composing at the age of 5. Most kids can’t even read at the age of 5, yet alone compose a musical piece. How do you propose he developed a set of skills to be able to write musical masterpieces at the age of 5? I find that to be more easily explained as nature rather than nurture, but that is an ongoing argument today. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I believe environment does have a major impact on intelligence, but sometimes your genetics can play a major role and you can inherit it.</p>

        <p>Intelligence is different depending on the society.<br>
A society would view intelligence as achievements. Think about it. Albert Einstein is an intelligent man. Because of his theories and his new discoveries… achievements, yes?<br>
I am 100% sure the world isn’t Einstein oriented. Meaning he isn’t the only smart man. There could be people much smarter than he is, however he hasn’t tried to achieve anything. He is your average company worker working under a big named boss and is just typing away or doing what ever he is told by his boss because he has a family to feed or maybe he is worse situation. Facing the world. Because he hasn’t exactly made the right choice. He is a prodigy at school when he was in middle school and elementary… Young entering highschool. Entering at the age of 11 and is now really small.<br>
He gets constantly teased, weakling and a nerd so he decides to fit in and smoke or whatever the bullies of his schools do.<br>
he has taken a iq test before in grade school and got a 197 on iq. He loses it. He is failing all his classes. His parents dont know what to do.<br>
Boom before you know it he is making money from mcdonalds. He is still very good at math.<br>
He is very intelligent but he made the wrong choices. Obviously nobody looks up to a mcdonald custodian as an einstein… nope<br>
He isn’t dumb naturally. But viewed by society at his achievements he is a idiotic moron who couldn’t graduate.<br>
Einstein is intelligent because he achieved so much in his life time.<br>
Even ball players like michael jordan. Is he a muscle head? NO<br>
he is a basketball genius.</p>

<p>The more common term for what I wanted to get across is ‘autistic savant’ or ‘savant syndrome’, more commonly referred to as ‘idiot savant’.</p>

<p>Huh?

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Why would ‘natural ability’ have to be inherited?</p>
<p>I mentioned savants because they generally have what could be considered ‘natural ability’ that wouldn’t necessarily translate from other skills as you seem to imply. Musical savants may not pick up an instrument and be able to play Mozart instantly, and they may need years of training, but musical savants can pick up an instrument and learn to play it proficiently in just a few short years, and most importantly they don’t need formal training. Musical savants also usually have extremely good memory, capable of playing any song they have heard before nearly perfectly, and many musical savants can also play a song nearly perfectly after only hearing it <span class="bbcode-i">once</span>.</p>
<p>There’s also artistic savants and more notably mathematician savants, who can memorize entire phone books, who can calculate numbers in their heads up to 39 digits, who can do complex math faster than a calculator and sometimes instantly. Sometimes these abilities have to be worked on, but they’re not a case of ‘oh, this person can learn a skill quickly’, millions of young children grow up with musical instruments and millions of children grow up with musicians for parents, millions of young children are taught instruments from a young age. The difference between a savant or a child prodigy to that of a professional adult, is that a savant will be as proficient in a skill <span class="bbcode-b">as a young child</span> on a similar level to an adult who has been practising that skill <span class="bbcode-b">their whole life.</span></p>
<p>Also, as a point of interest, autistic savants usually have a range of conditions ranging from learning difficulties to blindness and deafness, blind musical savants with learning difficulties are particularly common(among savants, that is). In some cases, savant abilities can diminish as the savant ‘learns’ other abilities. There was a case of a young girl who possessed remarkable artistic abilities from an extremely young age, on the level of people like Leonardo da Vinci, but then lost their artistic ability as they learned to talk (or for other reasons, it’s a single case and the reason wasn’t particularly clear).</p>
<p>It’s not like musical savants with learning difficulties can apply their cognitive thinking skills, or mathematical skills, to music, especially when they can play on a professional level before they can speak.</p>

<p>however. just because one performs a low-class maintenance job does not mean this person has not obtained a good education. maintenance is well paying for what is required to do (and also depends on where you work)</p>
<p>for example. restaurant maintenance crews won’t make much more, if any, than standard cooks or servers/cashiers/etc. but a regular trashman can make anywhere from 25-40k a year; depending on states. however, working as a trash collector for us postal services can make upwards of 50 and 60k a year.</p>
<p>this isn’t much money to make, but don’t say someone chooses a job because they have no education. some people enjoy doing dirty work and helping people out</p>
<p>also, you cannot be a genius at a sport unless you’re extremely knowledgeable in physics and can literally determine the angle/power/applied forces etc to the situation such as wind in baseball, shot trajectory for basketball and golf etcetc</p>
<p>he’s good at basketball, but is not a genius at it. kthx</p>

Obviously nobody looks up to a mcdonald custodian as an einstein… nope<br>
He isn’t dumb naturally. But viewed by society at his achievements he is a idiotic moron who couldn’t graduate.<br>
Einstein is intelligent because he achieved so much in his life time.<br>
Even ball players like michael jordan. Is he a muscle head? NO<br>
he is a basketball genius.<br>
[/quote]einstein was not intelligent because he accomplished <span class="bbcode-b">so much</span>. he was intelligent for what he had accomplished. for one, he was a physicist so clearly he had some brains. but he progressed the physics world a great bit with all of his theories and discoveries, his information obtained whilst performing studies and experiments, and his progressment towards nuclear energy and atomic bombs.</p>
<p>however. just because one performs a low-class maintenance job does not mean this person has not obtained a good education. maintenance is well paying for what is required to do (and also depends on where you work)</p>
<p>for example. restaurant maintenance crews won’t make much more, if any, than standard cooks or servers/cashiers/etc. but a regular trashman can make anywhere from 25-40k a year; depending on states. however, working as a trash collector for us postal services can make upwards of 50 and 60k a year.</p>

<p>also, you cannot be a genius at a sport unless you’re extremely knowledgeable in physics and can literally determine the angle/power/applied forces etc to the situation such as wind in baseball, shot trajectory for basketball and golf etcetc</p>
<p>he’s good at basketball, but is not a genius at it. kthx[/quote]<br>
Wtf, he is a basketball genius. Do you think a super physicist that knows every balls trajectory studied his movements and know momentum on how everything works can beat him?<br>
No. Kthx. This genius can understand every rule and read thousand of books about it.<br>
Can still never even touch Jordan. Jordan is a genius be causes the reaction he imposes when he’s on the field scoring points… Idiot. A pedantic oriented person is only good at one thing, just reading shit and memorizing things.<br>
BY NOW YOU SHOULD KNOW HANDS ON LEARNING IS better than just reading books.<br>
Do you see any true physicist that’s a professional at a sport? Didn’t think so.<br>
Because they aren’t good at sports and won’t ever be.<br>
If someone could truly be at sports because they are good at physics, surely varsity would be a nerdy competition. IT doesn’t work that way!!! THe way he played was his genius side.<br>
NOBODY can emulate it.<br>
I never said Einstein only was intelligent because he accomplished SO MUCH<br>
If you read it was exactly it was. Achievements and accomplishments<br>
His progression in science, math… Progression to nuclear bombs and atomic bombs and theories such as relativity are what he has ACHIEVED which is what I said.<br>
And you are freakin implying you can only be smart if you know physics. No thx<br>
Also I wrote this is how society would view intelligence.<br>
Do people see a garbage collector as a Einstein smart?<br>
Or do they see a professor at MIT teaching thousands of students more Einstein level?<br>
It’s how society sees it.<br>
Yeah kthx</p>
