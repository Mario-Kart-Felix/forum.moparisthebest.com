<p>Anyway, intelligence is definitely a large portion natural ability and mindset. I was born to do math. I can outshine anyone in my class when it comes to learning new mathematical material without any effort. That’s not to say I’m the most intelligent in the class – my mind is just set to math. Intelligence is very hard to measure due to this. Every person’s mind is different, not just unequal.[/quote]<br>
It happens all the time. Wait until college, I can not show up for a few weeks at a time and come out with very good grades based solely on tests.</p>

<p>Id disagree, with my experiences with school I was a type A person. The pace bored me and I slept in class but managed to get As because I caught on quickly. When I needed to I devised ways to help my pace but most of the time that was just a time management issue. The people who were top of the class were never those who caught on easy but were socially adept at swaying teachers at making their margin for error wider. Grades arent a measure of your intelligence they are a ruler for how well you play their game. I had a teacher bump me from a C to an A because she liked me, Im sure it happened with other people as well. I respect all of those who work hard in school but if you dare open your mouth to say your success was 100% derived from your intelligence I will laugh.</p>

</aside>
<p>I believe those that work hard (top of the class students) are those that were born without intelligence and had to work hard to gain intelligence. You are right, grades do not reflect your intelligence (in the US that is); however, they most often show how much work you put into the class. People that put hard work into the class (top of the class students) most often acquire intelligence from this hard work. Again, there are students who did not acquire intelligence and are at the top of the class. I always thought that the students at the top of the class were the kids that went home and studied for 6 hours every night, but I found out that is not always the case. These students created tools (problem solved) to help them study and succeed in classes easier. Therefore these students have shown to me that they are intelligent and not all just try-hards, by my definition of intelligence; the ability to problem solve.</p>
<p>I’m also quite certain that people that are born with intelligence usually chose to not apply themselves. Usually it is because the classes are boring, as you said, or that they feel the instructor is stupid. They are okay with getting a C in a class (no longer relating this to you), as long as they pass the class and get out of the school because they hate it. They may seem arrogant and that they are always right. They also justify this by saying that they are normally always right anyways. I would say that without a doubt, on average these types of individuals are more intelligent than the aforementioned, but they do not apply themselves.</p>
<p>When you get an individual that is born intelligent and also applies themselves that is when you get something special. I have found a reoccurring pattern with most renown scientists and great minds haha. They usually absolutely hated school, but once they found their passion and applied themselves they became something great.</p>

        <p>School is a tool to put you in the direction you want to go but until you get out you realize that you can work easily as hard and come out in the same place. I think you missed my point, I dont feel like the people on top are intelligent but are socially adept. Being socially intelligent is just as if not in some cases more important than being intelligent because of how dependent you need to be on others in order for motivation and support. You cannot do everything alone and a lot of intelligent people try to isolate themselves.</p>

I never said everyone was intelligent so I don’t see how that’d make anyone feel better unless they interpreted it in a way I didn’t mean lol.<br>
Example of what I meant:<br>
Current time<br>
-Average man with decent education grades</p>
<p>One hundred years ago he would’ve been thought of as a genius compared to the average person.<br>
In a hundred years he’ll be thought of as a not so smart person if compared to an average person (I assume).</p>
<p>Does that mean his intelligence changed? I think not, I just think the way it was measured is different, you can’t really define true intelligence; well we can’t currently…</p>
<p>Also in regards to “When people talk about  intelligence it is always in the sense of reasoning and solving problems.”</p>
<p>Of course that is correct, it is the generic answer to the question. If you believe that to be the only form of intelligence like you suggested in your post read some of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence</a> .<br>
Lil offtopic but Bowser, it annoys me how you state your opinions as if they are facts; I couldn’t find a link  within 30 seconds which states why you shouldn’t do that so I’ll just link you to a post which describes how it’s annoying <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/financial-focus/201101/its-not-fact-its-opinion" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/financial-focus/201101/its-not-fact-its-opinion</a>.</p>

        <p>Kid: Feel free to challenge my opinions, and don’t just get annoyed about  how I present them.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons for us being more intelligent today is that we have more knowledge to build upon, intelligence is more important today and there is no food shortages in the first world. The idea of intelligence has only a meaning when compared to others, that is why IQ is not measured in comparison to a certain standard, but how well the medium perform.</p>

        <p>In my experience anyone who measures intelligence by school is a complete moron, in the UK we spend about 11 years studying compulsory English, 11 years and most people only get a C grade. Is it difficult? No it takes about two weeks studying the grammatical structure, English isn’t even a difficult language while most foreign countries (notably the dutch who use these forums frequently and speak better English than most) have more difficult languages that have things such as cases and gender. In my experience school teaches you very little, it’s useful when for practical application (e.g one might want to have a tutor when playing the violin, but by no means is this necessary).</p>
<p>The people who got A* at my school were those who put the work in, this didn’t make them intelligent, it didn’t mean that their mental ability was superior to those with Cs it’s a complete failure of the educational system to teach people to work on their own. John Stuart Mill who lived just over a century ago could read greek and latin at age 8 and began reading plato at age 10, was this natural ability? I don’t think so his father had access to many books and was a very intelligent man who taught John to read and extract information for himself.</p>
<p>What I think is this:</p>
<p>Natural ability doesn’t exist - the reason some people are better then others at things they’ve never studied is due to cognition and retaining of similar situations, e.g a person who plays one instrument might be able to play another instrument well, why can’t someone be unconsciously aware of this? This is different in the case of sporting exercises when genetics play a part, although there’s some debate about how much they play, muscle is the product of nurture and to some extent so is your height (if you don’t get nutrition you won’t grow as tall).</p>
<p>Nurture - Is the primary indicator of one’s intelligence, if they’ve grown up around intelligent people then they’ve pushed their influences onto their children, it’s the same setting in an educational background if you’ve been taught mathematics by a complete and utter moron without self study you will be a complete and utter moron.</p>
<p>Cognition - Intelligence is a measure of cognition, memory, mental processing, abstract thought (e.g one who is able to make theories that fit the facts, and not facts that fit the theories, and who is able to extract the meaning of text in a deep interpretation rather then just reading word for word and agreeing without any logical construction and arguments, e.g intelligent people are often philosophers who delve into extracting large bodies of text and finding deeper meaning)</p>
<p>In other words what separates an intelligent person from a knowledge one is cognition and the ability to think for themselves without reliance on others; they’re also not afraid to come up with outrageous theories. Someone who goes to school and gets good grades is someone who knows what the educational institutions want them to know, someone who self studies is someone who knows what they want to know.</p>

<p>School is a tool to put you in the direction you want to go but until you get out you realize that you can work easily as hard and come out in the same place. I think you missed my point, I dont feel like the people on top are intelligent but are socially adept. Being socially intelligent is just as if not in some cases more important than being intelligent because of how dependent you need to be on others in order for motivation and support. You cannot do everything alone and a lot of intelligent people try to isolate themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You are correct, I misunderstood you. I thought you were saying you could only be born intelligent and not earn intelligence. However I do not agree that at the high school level that social intelligence plays a massive part, but then again I am quite naive in that respect. I only live in a town of a population of 3,000, so I have a very limited exposure to the world haha. I have never heard of a teacher bumping someone from a C-&gt;A, but I have heard of teachers bumping from a 89.4B to a 89.5A and whatnot. However I agree profusely that in the adult world social intelligence and who you know plays a far greater role than how intelligent you are. If you know the right people you don’t need to be intelligent at all. I have also found that most people whom I would deem intelligent are also introverts. And I’m sure the ones who are extraverts are near the top of the social tower. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I’m not sure if its the curriculum itself, but you are right that teachers are more pressured than ever to pass students.</p>
<p>There were some highschool classes that I should have failed and didn’t. The teacher once said he didn’t have a single assignment to mark me on. Ended up with a 60% (50% is passing grade here).  Than our provincial government likes to brag about how much smarter kids are now since they got elected.</p>
<p>The only reason I did nothing in school is because they let us get away with it.</p>
