    <title>Strength Trains Range</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/strength-trains-range/444618</link>
    <description>In my server when fighting other players it seems to train strength &amp; range and certain fighting options train different skills such as accurate would train defence attack and range.


If anyone can help me on this id much appreciate it.
