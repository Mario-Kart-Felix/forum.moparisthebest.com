    <description>hello everyone! im new to the forums!
ive been playing this game sence rsc became popular where i live all the way back in 2003. i was 12! now im 21! XD

 nice to see that there is still development!

anyways im happy to be a part of this project. i miss this game.

so for my questions...
 im trying to so ive been trying to make a client i compiled (based off of the source code of easyrsc) act better.

how would i do the following:
impliment a report system?
add a jagex style sleep/fatigue console?
sign the applet of the client so it can be a webclient?
change the logon screen to be random like moparscape4.php?
and impliment a music system like moparscape4.php?
play sound effects when certain actions are taken ingame?</description>
