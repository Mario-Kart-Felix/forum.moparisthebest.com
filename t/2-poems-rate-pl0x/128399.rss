    <title>2 Poems, rate pl0x?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-poems-rate-pl0x/128399</link>
    <description>Hey, I wrote 2 poems because I felt kind of bored, the first, I needed to write a poem for school. The second I wrote today just thinking about people in my life, and because no friends were awake to hang out with. So please rate, and sorry about the constant need for words that most the majority of you don&#39;t know in the second poem, it&#39;s not meant to relate to you if you can&#39;t anyways, but if you want, grab a dictionary and maybe you&#39;ll understand.

1. Numb-
&lt;blockquote&gt;What do you feel?
When you&#39;ve felt it all before.
I don&#39;t want to feel it again.
I can&#39;t take it anymore.

Love, Hate, Pain.
It&#39;s all the same.
To most it&#39;s just a game,
But not when these cold eyes take their aim.

I don&#39;t give a damn if you cry cause your best friend ditched you.
Or when your mad because your father hit you.
Neither when your deepest fury slits through.

I&#39;m gone from the world.
Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll make it back through.
I&#39;m in Hell&#39;s hallway.
Numb to the pain.
There&#39;s nothing to gain.
It&#39;s like my life&#39;s just stuck on one frame.

It&#39;s all a bore.
And as you adore,
I&#39;m cold to the core.
And now as I make my way up these steps,
I know there&#39;s nothing more.

I glance at myself now.
I guess you could say wow,
But then I&#39;d have to ask you how.

I&#39;m no longer filled to the brim.
I&#39;m empty, I&#39;m dim.

Or am I just to full to feel.
Just to much for me to deal.

Numb like a cold swim.
Frozen like a departed limb.
The absence of wind.

I leave now.
Cold as ever.
&#39;Cause I&#39;ll never feel anything, for never and never.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

2. Lack Of Compassion-
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fist clenches,
And so do it’s intentions.
It doesn’t know how to breathe, and it’s all regression.
Manifestation of it’s aggression due to lies of creation,
Imaginations of your torture increases it’s elation.

It’s chest is cold when It thinks of you, 
And it’s all It can do not to let this hatred brew.
But it’s to late, and now It thinks of how these thoughts were accrued,
And it can’t help but let it’s actions pursue.
And it’s to late for you as it’s emotional disposition is distributed.

As it’s abhorrence is acuted,
And as it reaches it’s destination,
There is no hope for your salvation,
You are now in line for damnation,
And your death becomes accelerated.

And to think,
You created this abominable collaboration,
With your selfish temptations and power hungry dictation.
The thoughts of your deobfuscation is it’s only motivation,
As is your fascination with power molestation.
“Justicia Servo” Is it’s ambition, 
And it has set off the ignition of your eternal excruciation.
And just like you and your need for constant prevarication, 
My detestation for you will go on in infinite continuation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>No one even goes in this board, why the fuck are you advertising that crappy ass web OS anyways. If you didn’t realize, you can’t go straight to the net without an OS, and you need to have applets installed to run that, so if you already have an OS, and your going between multiple computers, stfu and get an R.A.T.</p>
<p>Fucking dumb ass web advertisers, isn’t that against the fucking rules?</p>
