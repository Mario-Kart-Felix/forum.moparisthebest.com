Personally i think it is silly because i think like senior members should be able to rep because we have made 100+ posts<br>

<p>Yeah but Senior Members could have posted nothing but off topic or useless posts. Your post count means nothing. Anyone can post. Its the useful posts that count.[/quote]</p>
<p>Techically what he means to say is that a senior can be a total noob by posting spam or offtopic posts. Not all seniors are good. And Community Members are chosen by there good deeds. So thats what makes them rep.</p>

              <p>Rep has been reset for all Member’s you now need 15 rep to rep others. And only Community Members Atm can rep. So this determines REAL rep. Not fake rep.</p>
