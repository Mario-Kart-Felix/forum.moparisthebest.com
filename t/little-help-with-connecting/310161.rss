    <title>Little help with connecting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/little-help-with-connecting/310161</link>
    <description>After about 3 months of not running a server or having my computer I want to get back to starting a server once again but, I have a problem I cannot connect to it at all.

Things I have done to try to get it to work.
(Firewall execeptions)
(port-forwarding already done)
(Client-side ip)(my lan ip)
(server-side ip)(my ip)
I have tried thoses following things and still cannot connect to my server here is what I get.

&lt;blockquote&gt;runclient:
     [java] java.net.NoRouteToHostException: No route to host: connect&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So please a little help would be nice.(Before anyone posts[Use the Search engine] I already have and checked out for connecting to the servers).

So after three months of me being gone I cannot connect to my server anymore.</description>
