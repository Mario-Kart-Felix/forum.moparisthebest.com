    <title>Second Skin [MOD] (1.7.3) *sorry for wrong section, typed this on my phone*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/second-skin-mod-1-7-3-sorry-for-wrong-section-typed-this-on-my-phone/405803</link>
    <description>Well, I decided I wanted to go about making a mod. I saw a tutorial about changing the default skin minecraft uses when an un-paid name is online (the fall-back skin when no skin is found). I have setup my free webhost at 000webhost (ewww!!) to accommodate this mod. I tested this mod with the name [url=http://www.minecraft.net/haspaid.jsp?user=6578658765]&quot;6578658765&quot;[/url] and it has successfully loaded the skin from my host.

[b][size=20px]How it works:[/size][/b]
The mod basically adds a new method to the client. I called this method &#39;testURL&#39;. I simply, found where minecraft starts grabbing the skin. I added in a if/else statement and added in a second skin library of my own. The client (with this mod installed) will check the default skin library from minecraft&#39;s amazon host. If nothing is found (or default skin) it will check my host. If still nothing, it goes to the fallback skin as normal.
Note: My skin library is [b]not[/b] secure and will [b]not[/b] ever have username/password registration to make it secure.

[b][size=20px]How to install[/size][/b]
[ul][li]Start &gt; search &quot;%appdata%&quot;[/li]
[li]Find the &#39;.minecraft&#39; directory, and then find the &#39;bin&#39; directory[/li]
[li]Open up minecraft.jar in WinRAR[/li]
[li]Delete the entire &#39;META-INF&#39; folder in the jar[/li]
[li]Download the edited class and drag it into winrar to insert and overwrite the old one
        * If installing with &#39;Single Player Commands&#39;, install this mod after[/li]
[li]Close winrar[/li][/ul]


[b][size=20px]Downloads:[/size][/b]
[i]Version: 1.7.3:[/i]
[ul][li]Regular -- [url=http://up.ht/pvrLDy]http://up.ht/pvrLDy[/url][/li]
[li]SPC Fix -- [url=http://up.ht/r8hyYz]http://up.ht/r8hyYz[/url][/li][/ul]


[b][size=20px]How to upload a skin to my library:[/size][/b]
[ul][li]Navigate to this page: http://soharuda.webuda.com/mcskins/[/li]
[li]Enter the password &#39;mcskins&#39; and continue   (you must do this once a day)[/li]
[li]Have a PNG format image with the your desired username you wish to use. EX:  CoonHunter.png[/li]
[li]Hit &#39;browse&#39; and find your image[/li]
[li]Hit upload and wait. If you get a link to your skin, open it to make sure it uploaded correctly.[/li][/ul]



Compatibility:   (red = confirmed not, yellow = unconfirmed)
[ul][li][s]Simple player commands[/s] - Fixed![/li][/ul]

Please, if you have any issues with conflicting another mod tell me and give me a link. I will do my best to fix the compatibility.</description>

Actually we only have 1 cop, and no jail. This is a small town of 300-350 people with the occasional new guy that is lost and asking for directions. The dog came back and we found out who had him anyways. We solved the issue with a nice threat. If the dog goes missing again, he has 2 days to come up with the dog (since his brother is the one that took it, turns out it wasnt jinxy but jinxy did know info) that we would shoot the moron if he knew anything about it next time. The cop “Junior” was right behind us and said he wouldn’t stop us. The issue is solved, and no worries about that again. The idiots know we will waste a life for our dogs, as we ran over his dog today (ironically by accident, but it will tell em something. Fucking dog ran out infront of me while I was doing 60)</p>

I don’t know (and im at work)  so ill ask before my boss comes around. Does the imgur api use auto renaming? Like,  choosing a large random number to use to avoid overwriting?</p>
<p>Also,  php and mysql help would be greatly appreciated. This friday i will be turning on an old host i have to use for my mods &amp;  hacks. I’ll send you a pm for how i plan for this to work in the end.</p>

              <p>The entire skin grabbing process is not going to work with tokens without modifying the process itself,  or a custom class per person.  If i was to do this i would rather use a somple login and registration method that would store 3 things. An Username,  a password,  and the image url. The client,  would go to a page like so.</p>
<p><a href="Http://website.com/getskin?name=dhgfyyteu" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Http://website.com/getskin?name=dhgfyyteu</a></p>
<p>The name being an md5 hash so people cannot rip skins from one another as easily. I could setup a username hashing method into minecradt easily. The only purpose of register and login would be to prevent users from making a bot to overwrite everybodies skins.</p>
<p>EDIT: Added a compatable mod for ‘Single Player Commands’</p>

<p>and tbh I think it would be easy to do it the way mopar said. i reakon all it needs to be is a simple redirect to the required URL.</p>
<p>database wouldnt need to be too be too over complicated… primary key(also good cos you can see how many uploads there have been), generated URL for the redirect (<a href="http://yoursite.com/getImage?token=RanDOmG3n3rat3dT0k3n" rel="nofollow noopener">yoursite.com/getImage?token=RanDOmG3n3rat3dT0k3n</a>) (the token would be stored), and then the URL they entered (as mopar said, only from well knwn and used image sites).</p>
<p>you should give it a go. MySQL isnt all that hard, I mean… my first project in php was a minecraft authorisation server.<br>
if you want me to write something in more detain CoonHunter I may be able to help you out. Just PM me =)</p>

              <p>Here is an idea, why don’t you let them post a link to their image on your site, and your site would just forward the client to download that image?  That way you are only supplying text and it’s much less bandwidth than pictures.</p>
<p>I would limit it to common image sites though, imageshack, imgur, etc.  Otherwise if you allow any server, it could be abused like so:</p>
<p>Baddy upload picture to his website<br>
goes onto minecraft server with mod<br>
all users that see him download his image from his server<br>
he now has all their IPs in his HTTP log file<br>
he now DDOS’s them and raids their chests</p>
<p>It’s a stretch, but you know people would do it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

It gives them the feeling of specialness. Sure, if the other player has it installed too its great and dandy, meaning their skin will actually show. Otherwise its just another new guy lol.[/quote] iif you post this on a more famous site… people will do servers didicated to this mod. you know this right?</p>
