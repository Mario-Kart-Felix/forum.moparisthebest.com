    <title>508 coders Please :D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-coders-please-d/245713</link>
    <description>Ok, Well I have a download client, but i just thought it would just be a thousand times easier with a webclient. My server is 508, and ive only seen 2 other 508 web clients.

1:[url=http://www.freewebs.com/clienthax/]http://www.freewebs.com/clienthax/[/url]

2:[url=http://famouspkerz.org/index/0-11]http://famouspkerz.org/index/0-11[/url]

Neither of them work for my server. Yes I have tried a few diffrent codes. and yes I jared and signed it. Ive also tried a few diffrent ASP hosters

[url=http://freewebs.com]freewebs.com[/url]
[url=http://webng.com]webng.com[/url]
but im pretty sure that&#39;s not just it.  So if there is anything else I need to know to make a 508 web client I would appreciate someone telling me! also how to get it to work on  mac would help :D.</description>
