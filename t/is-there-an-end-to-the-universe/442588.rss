</aside>
<p>oh what a great experiment, how would you propose we test for people adding sugar or olive oil to our universe? well, you do say that dark matter doesn’t exist and instead the effects of dark matter are instead an outside force, how would you test for this explanation? because we can test for dark matter and we can observe it, and basic logic dictates that the simplest explanation that works is usually the correct explanation</p>

<p>if there was no big bang, how come we can observe that the universe is still “banging” according to the big bang theory?[/quote]</p>
<p>I won’t deny the fact that there are reactions in the universe. The big bang theory is similar to my theory. My theory does not mention/include when everything is sucked in and the cycle repeats with another bang. Instead the “universe” as we define it… “the totality of everything that exists.” Like a drop of water… our universe is limited,but yet expands inside itself because of an outside force. If you calculate our universes gravity, everything should collapse in on itself but it doesn’t due to “dark matter”. My theory believes that dark matter does not exist and this continuous movement is actually an outside force.</p>
<p>My theory is not made up off the top of my head, I examined a drop of water and inside of that drop of water, under a microscope, I added some different “variables” such as sugar, olive oil and other cooking supplies and watched the universe inside unfold to my manipulation.</p>
<p>It all relates to the Fibonacci sequence.</p>

<p>There is no big bang and the universe will not collapse in on itself. The universe is a reflection of itself. Inside the universe, there are galaxies and inside the galaxies… solar systems.

<p>Any kind of evidence of this? or just a damn retarded assumption?</p>

What is visible and what isn’t? Aren’t telescopes becoming increasingly more powerful?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>due to how the universe is expanding, there are parts of the universe that will never be visible because the light can never reach us[/quote]<br>

<p>Light cannot traverse the entire universe, so however long the universe has existed x the speed of light is how much of the visible universe we can see. (d = vt)</p>
