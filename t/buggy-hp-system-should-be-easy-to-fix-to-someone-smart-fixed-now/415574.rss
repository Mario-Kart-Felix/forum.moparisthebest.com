    <title>Buggy HP system, should be easy to fix to someone smart! :) fixed now :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buggy-hp-system-should-be-easy-to-fix-to-someone-smart-fixed-now/415574</link>
    <description>basically, when i do ::master on my server my hp buggs and it stays at 10hp even if i die, log out, anything....

i found a way to fix it, by editing the hp manually in the char files, but as i want to get the server public, i dont want to have to change everybodys char files everytime someone joins.

once i edit the line to this everything works as it should

character-skill = 3	99	200000000

and this is what it stays at when i dont manually edit it

character-skill = 3	10	200000000

also while its bugged at 10/99hp you cannot eat food or anything.

any ideas on how to fix it anyone?

thanks in advance :)</description>
