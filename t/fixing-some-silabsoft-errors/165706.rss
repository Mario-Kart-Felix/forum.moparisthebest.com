    <title>~Fixing Some SilabSoft Errors~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixing-some-silabsoft-errors/165706</link>
    <description>I am here to help a few people out that are getting errors when they open MoparScape or SilabSoft.

ERROR:
Ok the first error people get is, [code]Some Strange Error Has Occured Please Tell SilabSoft About It[/code] With some other stuff with it.

SOLUTION:
This is easy, download MoparScape (old) and Install it agina, Run it let it load till the log in screen then close MoparScape then open SilabSoft back up.

Here is a link to download MoparScape ~ [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/moparscape.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/moparscape.html[/url] 

Make sure to click the second &quot;Here&quot; as the others give you an error.

----

ERROR:
The second error that people get is something like this. [code]Javac is not recognized  as an external or internal press any key to continue...[/code]
Something along the lines of that anyway.

SOLUTION:
Ok, this is a bit tricky. Go to My Computer - Local Disk (C:) - Program Files - Java

When you are there make sure you have jdk1.6.0_03 and jre1.6.0_03, if you do not have these please download them. 

After you have download them Right Click on My Computer, Click on Properties, Go to the Advanced Section, Click on Environmentable Variables and then see if you have 2 things named PATH and CLASSPATH in the top box. if you don&#39;t Create a new one name it CLASSPATH and for the Variable add this...
[code]CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_03\bin;%CLASSPATH%;[/code]

Then make another new one named PATH and put this inside the Variable...
[code]C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_03\bin[/code]

Now if you already had PATH and CLASSPATH in the top box just double click on it and change the Variables to what is ment to go for each CLASSPATH and PATH shown above.

----

Now if there is any other errors you are getting, please copy and paste it into a rpely and I will work on the soltuon right away for you. :)

I hope I have helped people out getting errors to fix them. If there is anyone needing helpe with SilabSoft items, go to my guide on how to fix that. ;)

Thankyou,
