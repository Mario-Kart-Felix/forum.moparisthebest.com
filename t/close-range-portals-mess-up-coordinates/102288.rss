    <title>Close range portals mess up coordinates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/close-range-portals-mess-up-coordinates/102288</link>
    <description>Hi,
Im trying to put two portals near each other so they kinda teleport you into a room. But when a player uses them all other players will see the player being somewhere else, so the teleporter kinda only worked for the play who used it and not anyone else. Is there any way to update the players position so everyone see&#39;s him in the right position.
I&#39;ve used teleportToX and teleportToY and loadCoords(&quot;Coords.cfg&quot;, destinationhere); but the problem still remains. Any help would be really appreciated,

Thanks.
