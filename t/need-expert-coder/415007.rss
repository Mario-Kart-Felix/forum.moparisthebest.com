    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-expert-coder/415007</link>
    <description>Hello, I currently need a great well known coder that has coded a well known server before. I am running a 317 with at least 508 graphics. I will need a number of things on my client including. A custom lottery system, death cape, max hit calculator, pvp areas, teleport areas, custom client (I have a gfx artist), someone to use edit the texthandler file to say what is needed, change the form and vote redirect and much more. I would like to have your application before i send the link though. Depending on my options my tresurer will pay once we get donations or if we have any yet. Thank you for your time.</description>
