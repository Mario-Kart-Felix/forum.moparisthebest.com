    <title>Server crashing after 10 or 11 players</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-crashing-after-10-or-11-players/341787</link>
    <description>Ok so i am running a good server based off cammypvp source (i&#39;m like the only one who decided to actually change a bunch of things with this source so its not leeched or anything) but the problem comes whenever i get too many players

whenever i have 10 or 11 players online, the server dc&#39;s everyone for a second
i dont think there is a problem with my vps as it was doing that same thing on my computer before i ever used a vps and my computer has 3gb RAM
my vps has 1gb RAM and it dc&#39;s everyone at 10+ players online, and on my vps i even set the server&#39;s priority to realtime but it doesnt affect the problem at all, and only 30% of the ram is needed to even run the server so its definitely not an issue with bad computers or w/e. and the vps has amazing connection speed.

im guessing this is a problem with stability of the source or something but i really dont want to scrap my server and start off with a new source because it took me ages to do all the coding/programming/whatever u call it, with this source

if anyone has an idea on how to make my server more stable/let it hold more then 10 players at a time, it would be so deeply appreciated and even though i cant give you rep, i think it would still be great to offer help</description>

<p>tbh make a new void that is called in on login and if your name is YOURNAME then it will add you the admin crown but not give you playerRights &gt; 0; then you can change all commands so they work when YOURNAME does them.</p>

              <p>Ok so i am running a good server based off cammypvp source (i’m like the only one who decided to actually change a bunch of things with this source so its not leeched or anything) but the problem comes whenever i get too many players</p>
<p>whenever i have 10 or 11 players online, the server dc’s everyone for a second<br>
i dont think there is a problem with my vps as it was doing that same thing on my computer before i ever used a vps and my computer has 3gb RAM<br>
my vps has 1gb RAM and it dc’s everyone at 10+ players online, and on my vps i even set the server’s priority to realtime but it doesnt affect the problem at all, and only 30% of the ram is needed to even run the server so its definitely not an issue with bad computers or w/e. and the vps has amazing connection speed.</p>
<p>im guessing this is a problem with stability of the source or something but i really dont want to scrap my server and start off with a new source because it took me ages to do all the coding/programming/whatever u call it, with this source</p>
<p>if anyone has an idea on how to make my server more stable/let it hold more then 10 players at a time, it would be so deeply appreciated and even though i cant give you rep, i think it would still be great to offer help</p>
