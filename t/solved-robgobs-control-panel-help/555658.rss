    <title>[SOLVED] Robgob&#39;s Control Panel HELP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-robgobs-control-panel-help/555658</link>
    <description>https://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/google/tutorials/320061-pi-adding-my-control-panel-your-server.html
So I&#39;ve followed all of the steps until I get to:
then search for:
code:
&#39;public void destruct() {&#39;
I can NOT find this anywhere. I checked several files (obv. including client.java and Config.java)
Now if you scroll down a bit you can see
&#39;public void initialize() {&#39; which I can&#39;t find either. Any help?

EDIT: Solved. For those of you that need help too, absolutely NO code gets edited in the Client. All of it will and should be in Source/Server. And my mistake was that there were TWO .java files of the same name in different spots. The one you will get stuck on is in: XXX/src/server/model/players</description>
