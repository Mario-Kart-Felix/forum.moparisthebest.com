    <description>Ok i ran windows 2000 update a couple weeks ago without an active internet connection (like a dumb) and went to control pannel, which said:

an error has occured in the script on this page.

line: 33
char:17
error: error loading dll
code: 0
url: file://C:\WINNT\Web\controlp.htt

and the right side of the control pannel doesnt show any descriptions for anything i select.

den i go to add/remove programs i get this:


an error has occured in the script on this page

line: 21
char:1
error: object doesnt support this property or method
code: 0
url: res://sp3res.dll/default.hta

and none of my programs show up..

den i go to c:\program files\

an error has occured in the script on this page.

line: 361
char: 13
error: &#39;gFolder.HaveToShowWebViewBarracade&#39; is null or not a object
code: 0
url: file://C:\Program Files\Folder.htt

and NO FOLDERS SHOW UP!!!! only wen i use task manager all folders show up...

i download a game, called eviflames mmorpg, its a mu online private server i love, with the title muset.dat or some crap similar... and it says:

cannot load library/dll

the folder ones are what i think are caused by internet explorer problems, and i tried reinstalling IE but it doesnt do a thing.

and zomfg.... the stupid media player 9 doesnt work AT ALL anymore... i cant even reinstall that either... install shield is fuked... and i believe i had a kernel32.dll error also, idk...


[size=50pt] HELP MEH!!!!  [/size]

EDIT: also i noticed when i run AN installation program i get an error like so:

C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\msvbvm60.dll

Unable to register the DLL/OCX: DllRegisterServer failed; code 0x80029c4A.

click retry to try again, ignore to proceed anyway (not recommended), or abort to cancel installation</description>
