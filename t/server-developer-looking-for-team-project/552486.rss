    <title>Server developer looking for team/project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-developer-looking-for-team-project/552486</link>
    <description>Hello Moparscape community. I am looking to join a 317 project/team. I have been developing 317&#39;s since 2009. I have mostly been doing it for the learning experience but now would like to make a high quality server with others. 

If you have a current project or want to start a project feel free to private message me or skype me.

My skype is [b]coding.content[/b]

Message me your moparscape name and some information about your project for me to accept your friend request. 

Thanks Again!
