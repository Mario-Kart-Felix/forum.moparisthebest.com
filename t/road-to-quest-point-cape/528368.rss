    <title>Road to Quest Point Cape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/road-to-quest-point-cape/528368</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been playing RS for many years and after seeing [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=355008]Mihalich[/url] getting a max cape, I decided to actually do something on my account since it has been years since my last 3 99s.  I will update this periodically as I finish a quest or complete a skill goal.  Positive feedback and support from the community will keep me going.

There isn&#39;t a ton left to do (really, the hard part is the skilling) and I have a love for quests so this should be fun for me.


I&#39;d absolutely love it if you guys gave me tips on skilling or certain quest bosses etc, since most of the info is outdated online.


I&#39;d also really appreciate it if some of you could LEND me weapons for defeating the bosses, since my weapons absolutely suck (this is the first time I got back into RS after the EOC update, and whips absolutely suck now).


Another note, if anyone wants to skill with me or just talk to me, my RSN is [b]Battla Masta[/b].</description>

<p>There isn’t a ton left to do (really, the hard part is the skilling) and I have a love for quests so this should be fun for me.</p>
<p>I’d absolutely love it if you guys gave me tips on skilling or certain quest bosses etc, since most of the info is outdated online.</p>
<p>I’d also really appreciate it if some of you could LEND me weapons for defeating the bosses, since my weapons absolutely suck (this is the first time I got back into RS after the EOC update, and whips absolutely suck now).</p>
<p>Another note, if anyone wants to skill with me or just talk to me, my RSN is <span class="bbcode-b">Battla Masta</span>.</p>
