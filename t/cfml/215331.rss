    <description>Class File Manipulation Library

This has been long in the works, and I work on it whenever I get bored. I suppose some people&#39;d like to see it (maybe), and it&#39;s not entirely complete, but it works. Just wanted to throw it up here...

Design choices:

Constants are generalized. ConstantUTF8 is the only specific one, having a string associated with it. LengthConstant is a constant that has an operand of 2, 4, or 8 bytes in length (ConstantClass, ConstantString, ConstantInteger, ConstantFloat, ConstantLong, ConstantDouble). ConstantTwoShort is a constant that has two u2 operands (ConstantFieldref, ConstantMethodref, ConstantInterfaceMethodref, ConstantNameAndType).

Instruction types are generalized, i.e. OpInsn is an instruction that consists of only an opcode, and the majority fall into this category (*aload, the math instructions, etc.). OperandInsn is, obviously, an instruction that has a u1/2 operand (bipush, sipush). The rest is self explanitory. I stole this scheme from ASM.

If you post questions, I will answer them. There&#39;s a test class in there (Test) that shows how the Code attribute must be used for changes to be reflected in the written class file.

Please, PLEASE, use this and tell me if you spot any bugs. Thanks.</description>

<p>k00dr: BCEL was designed poorly, and ASM has no direct constant pool access. Mine addresses both problems. Plus I was bored.</p>

<p>This library is a bit like bcel in that you have to deal with constant pool indexes.</p>
<p>Still its better than a library built on c++.</p>
