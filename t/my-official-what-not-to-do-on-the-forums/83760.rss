Hi. Welcome and have fun. I will now be explaining on what NOT to do on the forums. Ever wonder should I do that or this? Or what I shouldn&#39;t post, should i post something that is good but might get people mad? All those and more questions will be answered right here! No hassle and it is easy.

Posting:
please when you post don&#39;t flame or spam
I am only accepting posts for people who need [u]help[/u] no one else sorry. If you post and your not asking for help you will be ignored!

Thanks and please post all questions you have, try to be very specific, thanks.

<p>Unless it is about a certain thing such as asking for something before searching etc…</p>
<p>That would go in the Download/Tutorials section I guess…</p>
