    <description>I downloaded my first server with a cache.. and well its going good and i am absoloutly in love with it but im stuck..

The server and client is off: RuneFx - Webclient ready           &lt;----- that is the thread name

and like everything is perfect except that when i look into NPCdrops.cfg i looked at corp beast

 and the npc id for corp beast is 5247.. so i spawned a bunch and killed them and just testing.. now here is whats weird

in NPCdrops.cfg the corp beast link (5247) is this:
5247	592
there is only 1 line.. and that line is line 19. (im using notepad ++ so it tells me the line) and the line ends after that.. just 1 line

and 592 is ashes i know but i kept killing it and i got a blessed spirit shield and a bandos hilt and thats just from a couple of kills?! it has nothing to do with a code for bandos?? or spirit shield codes??

SOMEONE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME WHERE DO I CHANGE DROPS/VIEW THEM AND HOW DOES THIS WORK? HOW DO I MAKE A DROP RARE? PLEASE HELP ME.. 


Thank You so much, Chase ;D</description>

              <p>The NPCdrops.cfg file is pointless for this source.<br>
To edit monster drops, go to server&gt;config.java</p>
<p>scroll down and there should be a line that says <code>//Corp beast</code> or something along those lines</p>
<p>Then if you wanted to add a new drop the format would go like…</p>
<p><code>Example: Dragon_Claws {5247,15028,1,85},
{Monster ID, Item ID, Item Quantity, Drop-rate},</code></p>
<p>Make sure you add the comma after the brackets.</p>
