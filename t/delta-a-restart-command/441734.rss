    <title>[Delta]A ::Restart command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-a-restart-command/441734</link>
    <description>I want to add a ::Restart command that combines the ::update command but actually shuts the server down and restarts it by itself. I ripped the update command and have pretty much it all figured out I just need to figure out a method that would help me restart the server. Thanks in advance.  :o</description>
