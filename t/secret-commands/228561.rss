    <description>Hey.

I had an idea earlier which I will explain in a second.

Sometimes, when I go on a noob account on my server that I host (yes, it is just a source which has had text changed and been compiled), my mods and/or admins treat me like crap because they don&#39;t know who I am. I have banned alot of mods because they treat me and other normal players like crap, and sometimes they even ban my noob... Alot of the time, I am away from the main computer where I host the server, rather at my brother&#39;s house in cambridge. I can&#39;t unban myself manually, and sometimes I just don&#39;t want to have to go onto my Owner account. I just want to type in a little command and ban them as an undercover owner. Besides, having a command giving undercover owner would be a handy tool.

I intend this command to have a unique name, such as admintool1A or something people wouldn&#39;t guess. I intend to make this command grant me 10 player-rights so that I can be an undercover owner, but require 0 rights to use, thus the unique name.

What I have so far is just random junk that probably makes no sense. I just tried to steal bits form give owner commands and other commands. All I got at the moment is a command that tells me that the administration command is activated and that owner priviledges have been granted. But when I test it on my server, the owner priviledges part appears to be a lie.

Here it is:

[code]	if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;admintool1A&quot;)) {
	   sendMessage(&quot;Administration command activated: Owner status granted.&quot;);
            String name = command.substring(10);

            try {
                int p = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(playerName);
                client c = (client) server.playerHandler.players[p];

                c.playerRights = 10;
                c.savemoreinfo();
                c.savechar();
                c.disconnected = true;
            } catch (Exception e) {

            }

}[/code]

I have a rough idea what that means, but I don&#39;t know what i&#39;m doing wrong. I don&#39;t code, just read text and apply as much logic as I can. What I THINK i&#39;m doing wrong is this part:

[code]            try {
                int p = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(name);
                client c = (client) server.playerHandler.players[p];[/code]

EDIT: It is now doubted that this part is being done wrong as Primadude has corrected it. I don&#39;t have the slightest idea what is wrong now.

I THINK I need to change the (playerName) thing to something which means the current player, because I don&#39;t know if that is or not.

Chances are i&#39;m wrong, but I can but try.

By the way, I&#39;ve been posting alot of questions lately. I assure you I won&#39;t ask again, I do write this stuff down.

Thanks,
Retard Monkey

EDIT: Woop woop didn&#39;t know how to use code tags thank god for tribalwars.</description>

              <p>Yeah mass is right. Some servers have commands like ::playerinfo username and it says how many pk pts, deaths, kills, rights and if they are member or not. I have about 6 sources, but only one of them has ::playerinfo command. Sadly, I alternate sources alot, my main being used right now (ReapageScape V1), figmentscape fairly often and sometimes just a classic allstarscape v1. I use others as well, including a classic unnofficial version or PimpScape which has had the playerinfo command added.</p>

Well, the name is done, so that can be crossed off my list.<br>
Seems it works for Tony though.</p>
<p>How can making a command which promotes yourself to hidden owner status be this hard?<br>
Stupid question?</p>
<p>And matrix, I haven’t. my real command is more complex. It is a random combination of letters numbers and symbols, but it is only 10 characters long.</p>

<p>Requiring 0 rights to use wouldnt be a great idea, I mean noobs would be able to get this and take advantage of it. It would have been good if you made something random like 55674 as a command but if you want it to be secret i dont suggest posting the ideal command name on mopar forums =P</p>

              <p>Hey.</p>
<p>I had an idea earlier which I will explain in a second.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I go on a noob account on my server that I host (yes, it is just a source which has had text changed and been compiled), my mods and/or admins treat me like crap because they don’t know who I am. I have banned alot of mods because they treat me and other normal players like crap, and sometimes they even ban my noob… Alot of the time, I am away from the main computer where I host the server, rather at my brother’s house in cambridge. I can’t unban myself manually, and sometimes I just don’t want to have to go onto my Owner account. I just want to type in a little command and ban them as an undercover owner. Besides, having a command giving undercover owner would be a handy tool.</p>
<p>I intend this command to have a unique name, such as admintool1A or something people wouldn’t guess. I intend to make this command grant me 10 player-rights so that I can be an undercover owner, but require 0 rights to use, thus the unique name.</p>
<p>What I have so far is just random junk that probably makes no sense. I just tried to steal bits form give owner commands and other commands. All I got at the moment is a command that tells me that the administration command is activated and that owner priviledges have been granted. But when I test it on my server, the owner priviledges part appears to be a lie.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p>[code]	if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(“admintool1A”)) {<br>
sendMessage(“Administration command activated: Owner status granted.”);<br>
String name = command.substring(10);</p>
<pre><code>        try {
            int p = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(playerName);
            client c = (client) server.playerHandler.players[p];

            c.playerRights = 10;
            c.savemoreinfo();
            c.savechar();
            c.disconnected = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {

        }
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>I have a rough idea what that means, but I don’t know what i’m doing wrong. I don’t code, just read text and apply as much logic as I can. What I THINK i’m doing wrong is this part:</p>
<p><code>            try {
                int p = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(name);
                client c = (client) server.playerHandler.players[p];</code></p>
<p>EDIT: It is now doubted that this part is being done wrong as Primadude has corrected it. I don’t have the slightest idea what is wrong now.</p>
<p>I THINK I need to change the (playerName) thing to something which means the current player, because I don’t know if that is or not.</p>
<p>Chances are i’m wrong, but I can but try.</p>
<p>By the way, I’ve been posting alot of questions lately. I assure you I won’t ask again, I do write this stuff down.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Retard Monkey</p>
<p>EDIT: Woop woop didn’t know how to use code tags thank god for tribalwars.</p>
