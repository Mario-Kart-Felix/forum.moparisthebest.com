    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/range-on-my-server-bows-use-melee-require-no-arrows/371818</link>
    <description>ok title pretty much says it, i put some customs in my server but when i use them they dont use arrows and train melee stats and on the combat tab they say &quot;slash, chop, block, lunge&quot; instead of &quot;rapid, accurate, longrange&quot;

i know its probly an easy fix but ive searched on 4 websites and goodgle for the past 2 days and cannot find an answer. thanks to anybody who helps me, it means alot.</description>
