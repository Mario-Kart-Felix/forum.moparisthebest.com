Are you sick and tired of servers that have too many players?
Are you sick and tired of servers that economy are too rare?
Are you sick and tired of servers that have ungrateful staff and don&#39;t care about their players?

I was too until I found Runesens, The server that isn&#39;t too big and the staff care about their players, the economy is not too easy and not too hard you just have to work, There is various ways to earn money including, slayer, fletching, woodcutting and mainly bossing.

Unlike allot of servers Runesens is unique and isn&#39;t full of customs, in fact customs is rarely found in runesens, we like to stick to the way people loved it but with a nice twist.

The owner &quot;Melee&quot; is a dedicated person has has never let the server down, He has built the server from his own blood sweat and tears for over 2 years since the original PI source release (With a few breaks) and the motivation is still here!

The main aspect of Runesens is the community, one of the best communitys i have ever experienced and as a staff member myself its one of the main reasons i log on everyday for most of the day to help people, I know from personal experience that people don&#39;t like reading a long description but i&#39;d just like to say, Why not give it a try? Add me in-game &quot;Fire Cape&quot; and make sure to register to the forums :)

Thank you very much, ill leave you now with some pictures and a feature list.

Have a nice day.

[/quote]<br>
Uhm, Jake is still owner, what happened to your donator anyway? I got seriously confused, Pm me some proof you donated before the reset on the forums and ill sort it out instantly[/quote]</p>
<p>Edit:  You guys made it sound  like the server (reset) again ?? I’m confused. Why is this being posted again? First melee made an advert a long time ago ( when I first donated ) , he quit so now Jake did an advertisement probably earlier this month. ( I rejoined the forums when they were redone ). So have you guys reset already again? -.-</p>
