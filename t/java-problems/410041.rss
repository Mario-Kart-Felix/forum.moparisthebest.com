    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-problems/410041</link>
    <description>i posted yesterday about a problem i had with my client, (sorry about the double post but this is now a different problem) but my client kept cutting out, i was told that this was because of windows 7, my environmental variables and java, i was told to download the latest version of java which i did, this made no difference..

when i uninstalled that version, all the java from my laptop disappered, now i cannot run my server because &#39;java is not recognized as an internal or external command&#39; and nor can i uninstall anything ect, because i dont have java anymore,

what shall i do? could someone even give me the links or names of the java softwares that i need to run my laptop such as runtime, jdk? theres so many

thanks</description>
