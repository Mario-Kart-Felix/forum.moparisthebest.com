    <description>[center][b][size=36pt]A Huge Thank You In Advance[/size][/b][/center]


[size=18pt]PROBLEM:[/size]
[b][size=10pt]Ok I&#39;m alright at coding, however this one has me stumbled. The problem is as soon as you log into the server you see the Task List tab is high-lighted with a little blooper above it and it doesn&#39;t go away by clicking it, or viewing the tasks.. I know its not a big deal but it&#39;s rather irritating. I&#39;ve run the files through eclipse and searched for phrases throughout all of the the files such as &quot;Task List&quot; &quot;Animation&quot; and &quot;event&quot; however, no avail. I can&#39;t find the chunk of code controlling this. All I want is to get that high-light off the tab and the blooper to go away. If someone could direct me to the file and section of code within that will allow me to turn this off It would be a HUGE help, I&#39;ve been going at this for about 2 days hoping I wouldn&#39;t have to post this.

In no way am I claiming to own or have built this source, full respects to the original creator, I&#39;m just using it to learn from.[/b]

[center][b]You can see here even in the fixed window view the Task list tab is still high-lighted[/b][/center]

[center][b]Hopefully you understand what it is I&#39;m asking, If I could pay you for your help I would, however my financial status advises me not to haha  :D[/b][/center]</description>
