    <description>help me with making this, plz! 

my drops don&#39;t work in my server, even if i putted drops in, they don&#39;t show up!. so i thaught a reward system for killing npc&#39;s would be also good enough, it would be a sort of drop.  could someone help me with making the following thing.

a reward system for killing npc&#39;s. so if i killed 1 guards it gives me a random item in my inventory. or it gives just 1 item. i think 1 item would be easyer to make. but i don&#39;t know how to make a reward system for npc&#39;s. could someone make for me a reward system for me. or just a begin. i could add the voids and that stuff i qeuss. because my drops don&#39;t work and i want drops or rewards for killing npc&#39;s in my server! i give 20% creds on my server to the one that helpd me. also more change to get admin! plz help me out!</description>
