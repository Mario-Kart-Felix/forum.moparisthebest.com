    <title>Looking for beta testers to participate in a closed beta</title>

    <description>[b]Short Background[/b]: My brother and I decided to slowly work on a new server over the years. We&#39;ve out sourced a writer for the server, to have an impactful and engaging story. It&#39;s an old school 317, with an emphasis on uniqueness. More importantly something different, perhaps a step away from what Runescape was intended to be, for better or for worse it is what it is.

The purpose of this closed beta is to be informed of bugs, small or monumental. Also, we&#39;d like to have suggestions from intelligent individuals, who have the same passion as ourselves for something different.

Those we are interested can message me on here, or on skype (Matt Puffyball), or if you have any questions feel free to post them below.

[b]A side note[/b]: I&#39;m still looking for someone who can create 3D GFX images that animate, like mage spells ingame. If you have the capabilities, feel free to message me on the above mentioned methods.</description>

              <p>My review on the server so far:</p>
<p>Straight of the bat, you are involved in a cut-scene which is later followed on by a mini quest you must complete. Long story short, you will be given an ultimatum which apparently decides your fate forever (I liked that part). The server is very polished despite it being in its “work in progress” stage. An interesting feature I was shown was that an android app created by the owner’s brother has influence on items you receive ingame (I’ve personally never seen this before). There is tons of custom content such as hand-made prayers, combat attributes &amp; weapon benefits, custom items which are relevant to the quests, interfaces, etc etc etc.</p>
<p>I’ve not seen many unique servers, and when I do I have to just congratulate for what rmark45matsu and his brother have achieved so far. I’ve probably missed out alot but the amount of custom content included is too much for me to even include. I suggest many of you keep an eye on this server in the near future, as i personally feel it has potential.</p>
