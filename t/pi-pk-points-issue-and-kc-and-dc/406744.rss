    <description>[size=18pt]I FIXED THE FIRST PROBLEM  :) [u][b]NEED HELP ON SECOND[/b][/u][/size]


[s]First of all there are 2 accs.
Test1
and
Test2
I kill Test2 with Test1 and noticed on the quest tab on my pk points code that Test1 didnt get the pk points for killing Test2
to confirm this I checked on the characters data files and it was affirmative.
I tried to change this in the PlayerAssistant.java but it didnt work officially I am now completely lost.
Below is the code that adds the pk points to person who dies which should be the killer.
[code]public void applyDead() {    
        c.respawnTimer = 10;
        c.isDead = false;
        if(c.duelStatus != 6) {
            c.killerId = c.getCombat().getKillerId(c.playerId);
            c.killerId = findKiller();
            Client o = (Client) Server.playerHandler.players[c.killerId];
            if(o != null) {
                if(!(c.npcIndex &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; c.inPits == false){
                }
                if (c.playerId != c.killerId)
                    o.sendMessage(&quot;You have defeated &quot;+Misc.optimizeText(c.playerName)+&quot;!&quot;);
                                if(c.inWild()){
                                        c.pkPoints += 2;
                                        o.sendMessage(&quot;You have received 2 Pk Points&quot;);
                                }
                c.playerKilled = c.playerId;
                if(o.duelStatus == 5) {
                    o.duelStatus++;
                }
            }
        }[/code][/s]

The second thing is I killed Test2 it should add 1 DC to Test2&#39;s char file but it didnt and on Test1 who killed Test2 it should add 1 KC and it didnt.......
NEED HELP

I fixed the 1st problem with this code
[code]public void applyDead() { 
c.respawnTimer = 10;
c.isDead = false;
if(c.duelStatus != 6) {
//c.killerId = c.getCombat().getKillerId(c.playerId);
c.killerId = findKiller();
Client o = (Client) Server.playerHandler.players[c.killerId];
if(o != null) {
if(!(c.npcIndex &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; c.inPits == false){
}
if (c.killerId != c.playerId)
o.sendMessage(&quot;You have defeated &quot;+Misc.optimizeText(c.playerName)+&quot;!&quot;);
if(c.inWild()){
o.pkPoints += 5;
o.sendMessage(&quot;You have received 5 Pk Points&quot;);
}
c.playerKilled = c.playerId;
if(o.duelStatus == 5) {
o.duelStatus++;
}
}
}  
[/code]
Could I add something to give KC and DC if you died?</description>

<p>  It could be that your program recognizes that both accounts are from the same IP, thus, not giving any points. However, I’m not the best at reading code from private servers. However, simple sendMessage(""); statements can help identify which part of the code is executing. I don’t think it ever said “You have received 2 Pk Points” did it?</p>
