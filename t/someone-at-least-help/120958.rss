    <title>Someone at least help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/someone-at-least-help/120958</link>
    <description>hi,
Ive recently made a very good server.
The only problem is I need some one to explain to me in STEPS
on how to place objects of my choice down and save.
E.G a fountain in fally say.

Someone please help me how to spawn objects! :|</description>
