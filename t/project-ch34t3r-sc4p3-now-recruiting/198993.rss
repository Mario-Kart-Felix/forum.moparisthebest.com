I&#39;ve noticed lately that almost every server on these forums anymore is running off of Project Czar and I am ready for a change. I&#39;m going to create my own new server series with the help of coders, graphics creators, BETA testers, forum moderators and administrators aswell as in-game moderators and administrators and hosters. This server series will have equal power in: Economy, Skills/Rewards, and Drops from high leveled NPC&#39;s. My goal is to make a realistic RuneScape style of server and another one with more commands and un-realistic things. 

As you can tell I look like a noob because of my account on here. But actually I know quite a bit about Java Code and how it works in this area of it. The thing is I will need coders for other problems/projects to add on. I could add a mini-game but I would rather a coder with more knowledge do it instead. I used to be able to host my own server until I switched my Internet Service Provider and now I cannot port forward at all. Trust me, i&#39;ve tried. So that means I will be needing 1 to 2 hosters. Hosters will get a copy of the server in CLOSED FORM. That way they cannot just take the server away from us.

Server Statistics:
[code]-Using RichScape V2 - Thanks Rich&#39;
-Hopefully adding Clan Chat
-Creating working client for server
-Making the client into a webclient
-Changing prices and stats of items
-Making 2 Servers, one economy based, 1 command based
-Adding Mini-Games
-Creating an area for a BETA version of Bounty hunter
-Creating a realistic version of God Wars
-Hosting could be 24/7 Depends on hosters
-Rares will have a realistic price like regular RuneScape
-Godswords will have the actual special attack and Stats
-Barrows has the effects
-Visage - Dragonfire shield making
-Will change drop rate of visage and other rare items
-Will adjust the HP and CB level of major bosses so it&#39;s realistic
-Going to adjust XP rate on economy based server so it&#39;s nearly realistic
-Fully working skills not including hunter or summoning[/code]

These are the current Jobs Available:
[code]Hoster
In-Game Admin
In-Game Mod
Forum Admin
Forum Mod
BETA Tester
Coder[/code]
