    <description>If any of you are familiarly good with coding, or setting up a private server in general, some help would be more then appreciated. The server is Epicurus and I plan on putting it up since I  enjoyed playing it. I already have most of the work done, I just need someone who can help me figure this out. My Skype is Justin.tokes</description>
