    <title>Snow!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/snow/286859</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I used to play a server, and in the server it was snowing... I asked how to do this once before, and someone told me &#39;interfaces&#39;. Seriously, that is all they told me. That may make plenty of sense to you but I am bad with certain stuff in coding. 

So, if anyone would mind explaining a little better, I would really appreciate their help :P

Thanks
