    <title>Custom cities?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-cities/257136</link>
    <description>I have recently became interested in server coding again, after making programs and other things with java i think im gonna take a shot at the servers again.

I have wondered if it is possible to add floor tiles, walls, and wall decorations, if anyone knows how would they please tell me.

Thanks you.</description>
