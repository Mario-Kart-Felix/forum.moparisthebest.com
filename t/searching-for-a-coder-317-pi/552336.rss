    <description>Hi mopar.

A couple of weeks ago i started coding OverloadX Source because i wanted to start a server. The thing is i only code for about 3-4 months now and the only thing i know are the basics and i can do some things with tuts and snippets. So i&#39;m searching for a coder that actually knows what he&#39;s doing and can teach me a couple of things.

[b]Information about the server[/b]

317 PI
OverloadX Source
PK Server
for pictures scroll down

[b]Why you should join me helping to setting up a server?[/b]

1. I got a VPS that can keep the server 24/7 online.
2. I&#39;m still learning about java coding so i will help you coding.
3. I will share 50% of all donations with you.

[b]What do i need to code if i join u?[/b]

There&#39;s allot that needs to get fixed i think i only did like 5% of all thinks i actually wanted.

1. Commands (50% done because i deleted all commands because it was full of buggs)
2. Setting up weapons at the good spot (when  wear vesta/stats/morrigans etc u see arms and legs)
3. Changing weapons skills (you can wear chaotic rapier and longsword with 1 attack need that to change to 80)
4. Fixing the lunar spellbook (you can use ancient autocast if you got lunar spellbook selected in game)
5. Bank all Button in the bank (tryed to do this but i failed)
6. fixing duel arena (you can change ur lvls when staking)
7. Coding that you can take firecape and chaotics from ground if you die
8. Reiteming the shops (i can do that so that will be my job)
9. Adding chaotic crossbow (its not a must but if that is possible it would be cool)
10. Setting up a donating/donator system.

probally there should be more to fix but these are the main items.

If you got some crazy idea&#39;s to we always can add that and i&#39;m always willing to help for what i can do.

Well some pictures of the server.
