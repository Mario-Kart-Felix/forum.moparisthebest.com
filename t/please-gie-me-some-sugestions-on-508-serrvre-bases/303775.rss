    <description>hi, i want to make a server [508] but don&#39;t knwo which server i should use as a base, i saw one i liked but then it turned out there were no emots  :(
this is what i kinda had in mind, if you can post the servers with:

-skillcape emotes
-air guitar emote
-summoning (i think i&#39;ve seen it in one server, i just want to know if you know any with it)
-hunter (well, maybe not, i dont like it too much [i dont think it&#39;seven posible)
-doesn&#39;t nesecarly have to have customs because i will add my own.
-(is it possible to hae construction?)
-minigames
-not too many glitches, and pleaase, i hate the glitch where all the npcs randomly change there stances in one spot


if you know any 508 servers with any of these things, please post the sever names below so i can use them a base, or pm it to me pl0x =P</description>
