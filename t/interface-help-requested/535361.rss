    <description>Does anyone know how to launch a interface like makeovermage by clicking on for example the &quot;Run&quot; button? i have been messing around, but just couldnt find it, i also tried google and the search button...

I did find out how to set it like up, but it sets the interface in the tabs area, not in the center of the gaming screen, also this is for a pi.</description>
