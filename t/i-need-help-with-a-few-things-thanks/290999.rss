    <description>I know how to edit most things in EasyRSC but I have a few problems.

1. I don&#39;t know how to let other people on my server.  I&#39;ve tried putting my ip in the settings document in the client.  I&#39;ve tried changing the private mudclient () to public mudclient () and that didn&#39;t work either.

2. I don&#39;t know how to unpack the items.rscd and loading.rscd.  I have RSCD Sprite Editor but when I try to unpack those it says &quot;...error in opening zip file.&quot; and &quot;null.&quot;

3. My sound doesn&#39;t work.  Even though I see different files that have the word sound in them, the sound doesn&#39;t work.  I have no idea where to start to fix this.

Thanks for the help!

              <p>The sound is definitely on.  I tested it by listening to some songs and I have the option turned on ingame so I don’t know what’s wrong.  I want sound really bad :(.  I think I have the answer to my first question because I’m using wireless.  I bet that’s the problem.  I’m still wondering how to change item sprites and the login screen.  I’m still wondering how to remove the option to make a rune 2h also.  (because I changed the strength for rune 2hs to 132 and made them a rare drop by dragons lol.  Godsword ftw)</p>
<p>Thanks for the help so far, you’ve answered some things.</p>

<p>Are you using a router to connect to the Internet? Are your ports forwarded to accept incoming connections? What you tried has nothing to do with users connecting to your server (or computer). Declaring something as ‘private’ means that it will only be accessible from that .class file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you click ‘Unpack’, what shows in the command prompt? These are the files that should be unpacked by default: media.dat, textures.dat, NPCDef.xml.gz, Items.xml.gz, Textures.xml.gz, Animations.xml.gz, entity.dat, entity2.dat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No idea what’s wrong with your sound.</p>

<p>Dunno where to look to remove the option.</p>
