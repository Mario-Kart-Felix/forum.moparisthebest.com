    <title>Nexon-World 639 : Client won&#39;t work!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nexon-world-639-client-wont-work/547757</link>
    <description>Ok so I&#39;ve been searching for a solution to make my client work but can&#39;t find any.
You guys are my last hope :D


This is the situation : 

I&#39;ve downloaded the 639 Nexon-World base (https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,563888.0.html , downloads down but you can find them if you search) and I&#39;ve managed all the basic stuff like starting the server , getting myself on it , making me owner , ...
The tricky thing is , making a client so other players can play aswell (right now just for friends).
I made a no-ip domain and changed every server_ip or any other part where it said 127.0.01 or nexon.no-ip.org to that domain.


So I went looking on the net and found different tutorials , some of them said I had to remove all java and bat files , which I did. some of them said I had to Sign the Jar , which I did. Some of them said both. I tried them all , first I had some problems with the manifest part because I didn&#39;t realize the name would be &quot;Runclient&quot; instead of &quot;client&quot; but got that fixed now.

If I start to run the client.jar on my pc , the client starts but it gets stuck at &quot;Checking for updates - 1%&quot;.

I thought it might be because I was running the server on the same pc so I sent the jarfile to a friend , he tried to open it and got &quot;could not find mainclass&quot; (I don&#39;t have that problem).
I&#39;ve tried adding a manifest.mf myself and when I ran it as a batfile I got this :

And yes , I opened my port 43594.



So now my question to you guys is : What the hell should I do ?




Thanks , 
Mr Empty


EDIT : If needed I can post a link to download the jar file , so someone can test and see what&#39;s wrong.
EDIT2 : Just ask me if you need more information ! :)</description>
