    <description>Well, Since I got a little bit of money (like 250k) i wanted to see if I should save for full rune(g) armor. I looked it up on runehq and it said that the helm alone was 250k so i said forget it.So I tried addy which is more in my range. It said its also obtainable thru Treasure Trails lvl 3. what is that heres the link: http://runehq.com/RHQItemView.php?id=1271</description>

easy: a lot of luck is needed.
first you go kill some barbarians if you want lvl 1's (drop black t, g, and normal, also some junk)
then you find a scroll, read it:
"goto ...... in that house" (messages are randomly)
then you goto there, find another scroll, goto the other place.
keep ongoing untill you find find the chest.
in the chest there are (most of them junk items) t, g, pages, beret's, cavelier and god items
<p>if you want to go buy it, you could:</p>
<p>[ul][li]sell full rune and with that cash you buy black-, addy- or rune t or g<br>
[/li][li]go chop some yew logs for cash.[/li][/ul]</p>

              <p>If you want rune g or addy g your wasting your time…simply because the gold trimmed or regular trimmed armor is not better than regular rune or addy armor…its a waste of time and money…i suggest buying regular because later on your going to want that money for other ranks…just a suggestion <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Treasure trails is for p2p players only. You kill certain monsters and they drop off a certain lvl clue scroll (lvl 1, lvl2, and lvl 3). Each clue scroll is dropped off by “harder” monsters.</p>
