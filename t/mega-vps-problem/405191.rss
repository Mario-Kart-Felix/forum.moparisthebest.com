    <description>Hey guys, I have a big problem with my Vps i recently bought.

I bought a 1,5 Gb ram Vps with 45Gb memorie windows 2008. One in the 20-30min everyone get lagged and no1 can login for like 20seconds. Its damn annoying.

The Cpu rise alot but i cant see to what becaus the hole VPS is freezing..

How do i fix this!? :S

Why are you using Delta anyways? Use a better base at least.<br>
Winterlove [pi] is pretty straight forward and simple to use, delta is just overloaded with crap.</p>
<p>Much better than anything I could do though obviously.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Lol at your knowledge of server bases, [pi] isn’t straight forward, its a very poorly written piece of shit that is so unstable it’s not even funny, the only reason it ever took off was because everyone though it was cool to have the new RuneScape items. Even though delta is overloaded with crap its very easy to remove and is actually quite stable if you put more then a day worth of work into it.[/quote]<br>
I said its straight forward, I never said it was stable it etc… All I said was its straight forward, may I ‘lol’ at your reading skills as there clearly not very good and considering your usually taught to read from an early age. Why are you talking about pi getting popular, that is nothing to do with this thread or what I was talking about…<br>
Depends on your definition of easy, I’m not saying I would find it hard however but it would be time consuming &amp; pointless for myself.<br>
Personally I dislike Delta. Delta just looks ugly to me when you play it, it has a old feel but its not the ‘old skool’ feel its a ‘old piece of crap’ feel.</p>
<p>@ T4’s last comment, is there a predefined scale of efficiency? Sorry, I haven’t seen it.</p>
<p>Okay, in all seriousness… Pi may not be ‘good’ but it gets the job done, I always thought RSPS was about fun until I joined this community lawl.</p>
