    <description>I think this is the correct section.

[center][b]Stick World[/b][/center]

&quot;Stick World&quot; is a creation in the making. (Although I thought of the idea years ago, but it is so simple anyone could come up with it) An mmorpg that is based on &quot;sticks&quot;. A Stick Figure (the players character) and a world of sticks to adventure!


Why Sticks? 
      Simplicity. Some of the best games are based on simplicity. Also I am not an artist :P





[center]Perspective[/center]

The idea is to have the game be 2d with a 3d influence. All sprites will be 2d but the in game look will feel 3d I took a picture of a rsc dragon and made it &quot;stick&quot; to show you you an idea of what you can do with sticks. A black and white based game would kill the eyes after a while so objects, npcs, buildings will have shadows of grey.

Below is a picture of the client layout (pretty basic) just to give you an idea of what is inside my head.

[center]Landscape[/center]
I was thinking of just having the world be the earth but is just too large. Then I thought of having the world be a mini Pangaea. Which I am pretty certain will stay. Maybe add a few islands to it.

[center]Timeline/Storyline[/center]

I personally like mid evil based games. So I have a pretty confident this will be based on the old days when maces were around. The storyline will be completely from scratch. I enjoy quests and adventures and I feel it is a crucial aspect of any game. A storyline allows for a developer to communicate to its players and show the players the world that is in their mind. A storyline will be written properly and from scratch. 


[center]PVP[/center]
At this point I am lost. I think games that are based on clicks suck (minecraft for example) latency was so unfair. I also don&#39;t want to straight up copy runescapes pvp design. Hmm</description>

              <p>Yeah I know right lol. When I hear “Stick” I think of all those cool animations.</p>
<p>Dungeon Fighter Online seems to be getting the mechanics right. They’re doing pretty good I think. It all boils down to replay-ability. You got to give players something, so they always come back for more. Whether it’s items, stats, achievements, gamemodes, etc. you just gotta capture their attention for all you can.</p>
<p>As far as my opinions go, I think it has potential to be something cool. Beat 'em ups are usually fun for one play-through. Then it goes into the back of the line for quite a while. I loved Final Fight as a kid, and played it a lot on my SNES (All 4 versions to be exact), but usually after a playthrough I called it quits for a week.</p>
<p>But meh, I’m digressing here. I haven’t really thought of having a stick game. But since they’re just stick figures, I guess the possibilities are endless.</p>

              <p>This seems like a good idea. But was far from what I was expecting. Was kinda expecting an open world game (or something like that) where you go around doing epic Kung-Fu, Samurai, Anime fighting thingy.</p>
