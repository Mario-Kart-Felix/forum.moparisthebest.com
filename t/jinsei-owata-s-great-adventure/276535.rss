    <title>Jinsei Owata`s Great Adventure</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jinsei-owata-s-great-adventure/276535</link>
    <description>This is an insanely hard Japanese Megaman-style flash game with ASCII graphics. 
I&#39;m not very talented with games, but I was able to finish the whole game in 2 weeks (3 bosses I think...)

http://www.kongregate.com/games/IlIlIlIlIlIlIlIl/owata-i

The original game was on some guys blog... There are other versions of it which are supposedly supposed to be added, but not ever done so yet.

Controls:
Move left = Left arrow
Move Right = Right arrow
Move up (ladder) = Guess what?
Move down (ladder) = The opposite of the above
Jump = Z
Shoot = X
Dance = S-key
Pump steam (Just for fun) = F-key
“Victory” = O

Didn&#39;t feel like moving this to Other Games section... but this is in fact the General Discussion section &gt;.&gt;

Also make sure you have the Japanese language pack installed for all the characters to appear fine.</description>

<p>This is Probably the hardest game on the Internet. It has been rated Impossible, so be aware.
You might have tried this game before. 
If you win, i#39ll give you...</p>
