    <title>Developing RSPS: Prior Knowledge Of Java?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/developing-rsps-prior-knowledge-of-java/537707</link>
    <description>Many people in this community had no prior Knowledge of Java before they went into RsPs. It seems as if RsPs has taught them everything/Mostly Everything they know about Java. 
Do you think it is essential for an individual to have Prior Knowledge of Java before beginning to develop an RsPs? Also, When i say &#39;RsPs&#39; I&#39;m saying any server available in the Download Section. Should one have knowledge of Java before they start coding a server? Or do you think it doesn&#39;t matter?
In my opinion, everything is much easier because I&#39;ve learned more about Java and then continued RsPs Development. 
What About You?</description>

I had no idea what java was before starting RSPS. Hence why my davidscape sources were such garbage. So I don’t agree that you NEED to know java to get into RSPS, but it certainly makes it easier. Using RSPS as a reason to learn Java though sounds like a fine thing to me.<br>

Yeah in all seriousness I agree with david. I had no knowledge of java before rsps and now I find myself using it to create tools beneficial to me outside of the rsps scene. I also remember when david used to release davidscape 508 sources lol[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s great for beginners to learn on, as a lot of it’s done for you so you can pretty much just mimic other pieces of code if you’re using someone else’s source.</p>
<p>If you plan on making your own completely from scratch, knowledge of Java is a definite must.</p>
