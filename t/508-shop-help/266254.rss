    <title>508 Shop Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-shop-help/266254</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got this source i&#39;m working on at the moment and I can&#39;t seem to find the shops in this one.  Usually I can find it but on &quot;Berky&#39;s Scape&quot; source I can&#39;t find it.  I&#39;m also new to 508s and still getting the hang of them and I got stitches in my finger so I&#39;m not spelling everything right.  Also I was coding all 317 for about a year or more and it was great and then I quit and im not as good now.  One more question why do people say 508s are easier to code then 317s but I can see as the code is cleaner then 317s.

Thanks,
Justin</description>
