    <title>Still can&#39;t connect?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/still-cant-connect/167379</link>
    <description>OK, I&#39;ve done private servers before, some might remember, but now no one can connect.
i got rid of my router (linxus) because it was screwing up, and i just bought a switch.
I wanted to play again,so I downloaded Gnarlyscape,made loads of edits to it, and when i asked
a friend to connect, he said he can&#39;t. I followed everything in this tutorial
http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,200036.0.html
and nothing is working.
i am using a westel modem, and my brother (being the fag he is) set his own username and password to it.
i asked him for it and he didn&#39;t want to tell me.
do i need to port forward when im directly into a modem?
I had cox digital internet (many haven&#39;t heard of it) and it was working fine.
now i have Verizon DSL and i can connect to other servers, but no one can connect to mine.

Please i need help.
