    <description>HI, i&#39;m codeing a Delta based source at the moment, i&#39;m having some probelms making players drop the items they have when they die. I&#39;ve noticed that when a player dies, they die on 1HP as opposed to 0HP, could this be thr problem? if so how do i change this? I would be highly gratefull if anyone could post their oppinions on what i should do, thanks for reading!
