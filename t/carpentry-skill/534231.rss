    <title>Carpentry Skill</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/carpentry-skill/534231</link>
    <description>Was wondering if anyone had any knowledge on how the very early &quot;Carpentry&quot; skill was used (if it could be used) and if it had any link to the houses in falador? Was it similar to the RS2 &quot;Construction&quot; skill in any way?

          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>Carpentry was a skill that was in the stat screen on RSC for much of its early life, though there was no way to train it. It wasn't until the Agility skill was implemented that Carpentry was removed to be resurrected later as the much more comprehensive Construction skill.
Originally the empty houses and large building on the east side of Falador were set to be the Player-owned houses along with an added and then removed part of Varrock. When Falador's graphics were updated on RS2, Falador's Player-owned house area simply became an NPC residential area.</blockquote>
