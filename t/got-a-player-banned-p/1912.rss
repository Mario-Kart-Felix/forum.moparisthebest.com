&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi Rs Pur3 Rs,

Just a quick note to say that we have now had a chance to look at the abuse report that you recently sent to us.

You will be pleased to know that we have now taken action against the player you reported and we hope that they will not be causing any more trouble in the game.

Thanks again for helping to make Runescape a better game for everyone.

Sincerely,
RuneScape Customer Support&lt;/blockquote&gt;
