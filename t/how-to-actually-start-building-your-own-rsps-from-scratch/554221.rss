    <title>How to actually start building your own RSPS - from scratch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-actually-start-building-your-own-rsps-from-scratch/554221</link>
    <description>Hey,

I was wondering how to actually start building your own RSPS. I understand that it isn&#39;t just done, you need to have a good amount of knowledge of Java and probably some networking (eg Netty) skills. I now have about 2-3 years of Java knowledge and I can say that I understand netty, aldue i&#39;m not an pro with it [i]yet[/i].

 A RSPS has two sides, a client and a server. Whenever I see the server side, I understand alot of it. I always think if I have enough time I could make it. But, whenever I see some client code, I always think how someone could ever make something like that. Probably because the&#39;re using an client from Runescape that is obfuscated. (not entirely sure, due). The code is messy, classes have weird names. I understand obfuscation, but it is still a mystery how some server developers can release their own client.

I looked down into the Tutorials section and saw a lot of tutorials about making little things; snippets of code, little tutorials explaining or giving information/code to get [i]one thing working on one type[/i] of server. On google, youtube or other sites I cant really find any more information about actually creating your own RSPS server, without the need to download someone elses and edit their code. 

I know that my topic has no real question, so here they come:

[ul][li]How do server developers actually create their own without an client? Do they temporary use someone elses client while building their own server, and later on creating an client?[/li]
[li]Does someone has experience with creating clients? How do you start?[/li][/ul]


I have probably a lot of questions, but RSPS in general are really interesting.

well you have one problem. Nobody has kept a repo of game caches in ages so even if you did write the server you would have no game cache for it.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is the issue with developing emulation platforms. Either we don’t have a gamepack, data, or cipher keys for the landscape files. Just have to assure its a 32 bit integer, not something insane.</p>

I think that’s the link, I can’t check right now though. Maybe somebody else can link you to the link for archives if it’s not the right one.</p>

<p>And what about older versions? For example, lets say I want to start developing an 718 server/client. I’m sure Runescape doesn’t have all the clients just downloadable at their servers. It’s only the current client that is online, right?</p>
