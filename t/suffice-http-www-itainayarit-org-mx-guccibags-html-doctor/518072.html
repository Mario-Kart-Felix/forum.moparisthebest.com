The girl was only 18, along with five months expectant."She loved her family members, and she also loved our family, too,Inch says Lee Conley, Gamble’s surrogate father.The Conleys took Wager into their home and their hearts after her biological family chop down apart. For the Conleys, your ex unsolved murder is their continuing sorrow.“It’s tough, even 22 years later,” Strassmann thought to Lee."Yes, it is,Inches Lee confirmed. "Hard, tough, hard. And I’m certainly not gonna give up. An individual knows something."Finally, now time, there’s a probable break in the mystery of her death, Strassmann says, thanks to a clever new way of coaxing leads from individuals with secrets.Jails are the Internet of unsolved crimes, Strassmann says. Criminals know things, these people hear things and quite often they talk. Now, at Florida’s Polk Local jail, a deck of credit cards is helping to heat up cold cases.“Instead regarding interviewing each prisoner advocates individually, which is impossible, I thought this is a perfect way to get the information available,” said California Department of Law Enforcement Special Agent Tommy Beam.Strassmann says Ray stood a brainstorm. He recognized inmates spent a long time playing cards, so why not have them play with a special outdoor patio? Fifty-two cards, 52 unresolved murders, some of them many years old.    no previous page next    1/2  <a href="http://ruizmasse.com/ralphlaurenoutlet.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ralph lauren outlet online</a><br>
