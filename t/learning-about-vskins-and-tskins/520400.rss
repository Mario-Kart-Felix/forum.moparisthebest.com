    <title>Learning about vskins and tskins</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/learning-about-vskins-and-tskins/520400</link>
    <description>i think this would be a good topic for us in the models section to talk about
explaining tskins/vskins.
everyone knows how PRI&#39;s work they just control which parts show over whatelse, but does everyone understand tskins/vskins?
i mean if we unerstand how they work then can&#39;t we make our own animations for models as in like today i was looking over a MQOV2 model of a whip i had in my raw files and was trying to understand how it works i got all the tskins/vskins from the handle to the tip here they are:

tskins go 29 28 30 54 58 59 60 61
vskins go 50 52 65 66 56 88 87 61

if you watch the whips animation as you stand in one spot (*btw when i said animations i mean just standing still animations not anything like when the player runs or any character animations*) the whip sways back and forth and at the tip of the whip as it sways the very tip swings forward does this have something to do with transitioning the vskins from 56 to 88 and 87 then back to 61? also why do they use those numbers? like do they correspond to a central point or something? i would love to be able to understand how this stuff works if anyone knows anything about this, please explain some of your knowledge. thanks, alex</description>

I doubt those number are very specific, they are just the numbers jagex choose to use for the whip. if you made a model and animated it with your own Tskin/Vskin and you put it in rsposer you could make your own animations with them. At least, this is my theory.<br>

<p>well i mean do those numbers correspond to something like how do they control the way the model moves ya know and rsposer is for player animations the thing im talking about is what the tskins and vskins are on the model in metaseq, i changed the 88 and 87 in the vskins to 19 and 20 and it totally changed the animations so obviously it has a big deal with how it moves, i wish i knew how it works.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t think it does as much. Once you make an animation in rsposer, that animation is tied to that specific sequence of<br>
numbers. you can’t make an animation using certain skins then change the skin and still using that animation. these animations are have specified skins. tskins would be like the muscles in a body and vskin1 would be the bones. thats a way i see it Pri would be the outer skin</p>
