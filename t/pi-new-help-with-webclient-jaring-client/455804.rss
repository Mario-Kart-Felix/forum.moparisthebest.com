    <description>Well, i&#39;m looking for someone who can help me jaring the client and webclient on teamtviwer

Problems faced when i jar the client:
1- The client will be like 15-16m after jaring.
2- I can&#39;t open the client after jaring

When i jar my client i think that im missing something
So if anyone wanna help me on this two steps would really be appreciated
