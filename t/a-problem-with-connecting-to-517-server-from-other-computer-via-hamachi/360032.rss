    <title>A problem with connecting to 517 server from other computer via hamachi</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-problem-with-connecting-to-517-server-from-other-computer-via-hamachi/360032</link>
    <description>Okay first of all this is 2nd nigth i haven&#39;t slept because i have been googling and searching youtube for this problem so please help me because this is driving me to suicide!

idk if this is right section to ask this but this is about the server and the client, actually i can tell which of them is failing or both. 

I downloaded silent-strike 517 (i think its 517) source and client to my computer. I can log into the server on my computer which is running the server and i got jdk and i put the cache to C: drive. I want to play it with my friend by using hamachi and that part is the problem. I dont know if i need to change ip or something. I have already tried changing ip in the client from class68_sub20_sub15.java to my hamachi ip but it still doesnt work. The other computer is connected to my hamachi and all but it gets stuck at the checking for updates part of the client so it wont load silnet-strike. So i think im playing localhost but i have no idea how to change that so my friend can join me. (it is kinda boring to pk alone in the server :d)  I am very very noob with private servers and coding and java n all but  517 is blowing my mind o.O I&#39;ve searched for threads on the forum to help me with this but i still cant find help.

What is wrong or what am i failing at because i dont know what to do anymore! 
I appreciate any1 for helping me!</description>
