    <description>by the title you know i need a knew web dev team, and a good one, sadly the last of our old team isnt with us any more :( dont ask what type of accident he was in we are not answering questions about it!

now the colours we want are     Blue and gold or red and black
good logos and the header should be whatever you think suits the style of the website and the colours
with the header we would like futursoft developments somewere on it. (you should assume it is to fit the style).

now we need some people please post in this thread or pm me (please show a picture screenshot or some sort of proof you are a good web dev).    maybe a link to a site you previously done.

All webdevs will be admins in all of our games and given full rights/credits to the sites design.</description>
