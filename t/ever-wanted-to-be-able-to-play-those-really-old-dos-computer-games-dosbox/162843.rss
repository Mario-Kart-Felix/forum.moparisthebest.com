    <description>Yes, another Emulator TuT! ;)
Important things are *Noted :P

[size=13pt][b]*NOTE[/b][/size]
In order to [i]truly[/i] enjoy these games you need to be able to look past their graphical/audio shortcomings. If you can&#39;t do that, don&#39;t bother trying this. Don&#39;t judge a game by its screenshots!

These are [b]fun[/b] games that I do enjoy playing every now and then. I wouldn&#39;t bother spending this much time writing a tutorial to set this up if I thought the games were crap.

This TuT is for a program called DOSBox, a program that allows you to play games like...

UFO Enemy Unknown [Turn Based Strategy]
[img]http://www.forteca.pl/img/f002/ufo-am/1.jpg[/img]

WarCraft Orcs and Humans [Real Time Strategy]
[img]http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/warcraft.gif[/img]

ChexQuest [...First Person Shooter] lol
[img]http://www.doomlegends.com/chexquest/cover.jpg[/img]
Its a mod of DooM...and yes it was placed in boxes of Chex cereal back in 1996, back when placing CDs in boxes of cereal was unheard of.

Those are a couple of my favorite. On to the TuT!

[b]Part1[/b]

1. Download DOSBox 0.72 from [url=http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/download.php?main=1]Their Homepage[/url]

2. Make a folder on your C Drive, call it DOS

3. Run the DOSBox 0.72 installer, change the installation directory to your newly created folder.
[IMG]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/instal.jpg[/img]

3. After its completed, go to your DOS folder.

4. Create a new folder inside the DOS folder, call it CDRIVE.
[IMG]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/folder.jpg[/img]

[b]Part2[/b]

1. Open up dosbox.conf in notepad.

2. Scroll to the bottom of the document, find this.
[code]
[autoexec]
# Lines in this section will be run at startup.
[/code]

3. Open up My Computer, find your disk drive letter

Example: Mine would be E
[IMG]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/diskdrive-1.jpg[/img]

4. Go back to the dosbox.conf file and add these lines under 
# Lines in this section will be run at startup.
[code]
mount C C:\DOS\CDRIVE
mount * *:\ -t cdrom (REPLACE * WITH YOUR DRIVE LETTER!!!!!)
C:
CLS
[/code]

For example mine would look like this:

[code]
mount C C:\DOS\CDRIVE
mount E E:\ -t cdrom
C:
CLS
[/code]

After putting that in, save the dosbox.conf file, close it.

[b]Part3[/b]

1. Obtain a DOS game, search Google for DOS game downloads or something. 
Although if you want to find a game quickly, and get on with this TuT I&#39;ve uploaded ChexQuest to: http://rapidshare.com/files/74582150/chex_quest.zip

[size=13pt][b]*NOTE[/b][/size]
For the rest of the TuT I will be using ChexQuest as an example, but the same process can be applied to any DOS game.

2. Make a folder for ChexQuest in your CDRIVE folder. It should not be more than 8 characters~explained later.
So just make a folder called, ChexQ then extract chextquest.zip into it.

Now heres where you would want to read any ReadMe files, for example this one has you run chexquest.exe before opening DOSBox to extract everything, do so.

3. Start DOSBox! You will be greeted with this screen:
[IMG]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dos1.jpg[/img]

4. Now type in dir
Theres your folder you made earlier!
[IMG]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dos2.jpg[/img]

To open it, just type in:cd chexq
Then type dir again to see all the files
[IMG]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dis4.jpg[/img]

Now you see why you should keep the names short, or else they&#39;ll get cutoff example: CHEXQU~1 
I&#39;m not saying you should go through and change every title, just keep the folder names for your games short.

Now to &quot;setup&quot; the game. Type in setup.exe Your now greeted by a different screen
[IMG]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dos5.jpg[/img]

Use the arrows keys and enter to select your Music Device, it will list various cards.

Choose Adlib as this is best emulated by DOSBox.

For the Sound FX Device choose Sound Blaster, then for everything else just press enter 4 more times, don&#39;t bother moving the selection bar

So it should look like this:
[IMG]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dos6.jpg[/img]
[size=13pt][b]*NOTE[/b][/size] 
For EVERY DOS game you download you will have to run a Setup, just repeat the above every time. The setups will not be exactly like this, but they all are pretty close to it.

There! Your done, choose Save parameters to save and exit and you will be return to the DOS screen. Type dir again to see everything.

Now press the keys alt+enter to make everything full screen, then just type in chex.exe to run the game. It will display some loading before the game actually starts, just a heads up. Usually the loading only take 2-3 seconds at [b]max[/b]

[size=13pt][b]*NOTE[/b][/size]
Trying to make the game full screen [i]while[/i] you are playing the game usually messes up the color! So make it full screen [i]before[/i] you run the .exe

Screenshot of ChexQuest
[IMG]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dos7.jpg[/img]
If the sound doesn&#39;t work...turn on your speakers :P That or you did something wrong in the setup

When your done playing: save, quit, and you&#39;ll be returned to DOS, just type exit to leave DOS.

Thats it! Please post any errors and I will try to answer them. :D
Also comments would be nice. ;)

<p>Yea now that I think about it I guess UFO doesn’t need DOSBox…and yea its fuck-hard I’ve tried the game on normal about 3 times and lost every time &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Eventually I hope I’ll figure out what I’m doing wrong and win…but who knows lol</p>

              <p>Yes, another Emulator TuT! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Important things are *Noted <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>[size=13pt]<span class="bbcode-b">*NOTE</span>[/size]<br>
In order to <span class="bbcode-i">truly</span> enjoy these games you need to be able to look past their graphical/audio shortcomings. If you can’t do that, don’t bother trying this. Don’t judge a game by its screenshots!</p>
<p>These are <span class="bbcode-b">fun</span> games that I do enjoy playing every now and then. I wouldn’t bother spending this much time writing a tutorial to set this up if I thought the games were crap.</p>
<p>This TuT is for a program called DOSBox, a program that allows you to play games like…</p>
<p>UFO Enemy Unknown [Turn Based Strategy]<br>
<img src="http://www.forteca.pl/img/f002/ufo-am/1.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>WarCraft Orcs and Humans [Real Time Strategy]<br>
<img src="http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/warcraft.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>ChexQuest […First Person Shooter] lol<br>
<img src="http://www.doomlegends.com/chexquest/cover.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
Its a mod of DooM…and yes it was placed in boxes of Chex cereal back in 1996, back when placing CDs in boxes of cereal was unheard of.</p>
<p>Those are a couple of my favorite. On to the TuT!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Part1</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download DOSBox 0.72 from <a href="http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/download.php?main=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Their Homepage</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a folder on your C Drive, call it DOS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the DOSBox 0.72 installer, change the installation directory to your newly created folder.<br>
<img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/instal.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After its completed, go to your DOS folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new folder inside the DOS folder, call it CDRIVE.<br>
<img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/folder.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Part2</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open up dosbox.conf in notepad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scroll to the bottom of the document, find this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[autoexec]
# Lines in this section will be run at startup.</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Open up My Computer, find your disk drive letter</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: Mine would be E<br>
<img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/diskdrive-1.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Go back to the dosbox.conf file and add these lines under</li>
</ol>
<h1>Lines in this section will be run at startup.</h1>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mount C C:\DOS\CDRIVE
mount * *:\ -t cdrom (REPLACE * WITH YOUR DRIVE LETTER!!!!!)
C:
CLS</code></pre>
<p>For example mine would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mount C C:\DOS\CDRIVE
mount E E:\ -t cdrom
C:
CLS</code></pre>
<p>After putting that in, save the dosbox.conf file, close it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Part3</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain a DOS game, search Google for DOS game downloads or something.<br>
Although if you want to find a game quickly, and get on with this TuT I’ve uploaded ChexQuest to: <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/74582150/chex_quest.zip" rel="nofollow noopener">http://rapidshare.com/files/74582150/chex_quest.zip</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[size=13pt]<span class="bbcode-b">*NOTE</span>[/size]<br>
For the rest of the TuT I will be using ChexQuest as an example, but the same process can be applied to any DOS game.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Make a folder for ChexQuest in your CDRIVE folder. It should not be more than 8 characters~explained later.<br>
So just make a folder called, ChexQ then extract chextquest.zip into it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now heres where you would want to read any ReadMe files, for example this one has you run chexquest.exe before opening DOSBox to extract everything, do so.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Start DOSBox! You will be greeted with this screen:<br>
<img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dos1.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now type in dir<br>
Theres your folder you made earlier!<br>
<img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dos2.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To open it, just type in:cd chexq<br>
Then type dir again to see all the files<br>
<img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dis4.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Now you see why you should keep the names short, or else they’ll get cutoff example: CHEXQU~1<br>
I’m not saying you should go through and change every title, just keep the folder names for your games short.</p>
<p>Now to “setup” the game. Type in setup.exe Your now greeted by a different screen<br>
<img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dos5.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Use the arrows keys and enter to select your Music Device, it will list various cards.</p>
<p>Choose Adlib as this is best emulated by DOSBox.</p>
<p>For the Sound FX Device choose Sound Blaster, then for everything else just press enter 4 more times, don’t bother moving the selection bar</p>
<p>So it should look like this:<br>
<img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dos6.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
[size=13pt]<span class="bbcode-b">*NOTE</span>[/size]<br>
For EVERY DOS game you download you will have to run a Setup, just repeat the above every time. The setups will not be exactly like this, but they all are pretty close to it.</p>
<p>There! Your done, choose Save parameters to save and exit and you will be return to the DOS screen. Type dir again to see everything.</p>
<p>Now press the keys alt+enter to make everything full screen, then just type in chex.exe to run the game. It will display some loading before the game actually starts, just a heads up. Usually the loading only take 2-3 seconds at <span class="bbcode-b">max</span></p>
<p>[size=13pt]<span class="bbcode-b">*NOTE</span>[/size]<br>
Trying to make the game full screen <span class="bbcode-i">while</span> you are playing the game usually messes up the color! So make it full screen <span class="bbcode-i">before</span> you run the .exe</p>
<p>Screenshot of ChexQuest<br>
<img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o26/photos_r_me/dos7.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
If the sound doesn’t work…turn on your speakers <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> That or you did something wrong in the setup</p>
<p>When your done playing: save, quit, and you’ll be returned to DOS, just type exit to leave DOS.</p>
<p>Thats it! Please post any errors and I will try to answer them. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
