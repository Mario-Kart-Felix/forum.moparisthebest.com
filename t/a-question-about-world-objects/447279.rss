    <title>A question about World objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-question-about-world-objects/447279</link>
    <description>Does it happen to be possible to delete world objects client-sided, such as a tree, or stump? What I am wondering this for is because as of now, they&#39;re only deleted server sided. 

Why does this bother me? Any time you travel/teleport/login to an area with deleted objects, they load for a fraction of a second until the server communicates with them not to load. It just seems unprofessional looking to me, especially if I want to have a semi-successful server. Also, if deleting objects is possible, that means creating them through the client would be possible as well. Correct?

Any help/suggestions is/are very welcome. Thanks for your time!</description>
