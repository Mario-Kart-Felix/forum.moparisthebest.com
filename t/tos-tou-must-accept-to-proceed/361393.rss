    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tos-tou-must-accept-to-proceed/361393</link>
    <description>Ok, atm i have a tos/tou in place before you can get the the forums/server...but also atm if anybody knows a link into the website without pressing the accept button they can skip past that and go right into the forums and server. i need a flawless way to make everybody who enters my site everyday pass through that tos/tou so that i will not get shutdown. atm you can look at my forums at this location.

this is not advertising i am simply asking a question that needs to be seen to be explained.

ok when you get to the site press accept.
then when it gives you the redirection url copy that...
exit your browser and open a new one. paste that url in the url thing on the top of the browser. 
it goes right to the page without going to the tos/tou so i need a way to make everyone go to the tos/tou no matter what.</description>
