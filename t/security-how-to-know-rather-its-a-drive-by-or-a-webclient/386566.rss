    <description>[u][b]For starters:[/b][/u]
A Java based Drive-by is java based application that downloads a file and runs it on your computer.
[u][b]-       Exemple: [/b][/u]
A webclient downloads cache files and run them from you computer right, its easy to thro in a .exe file there and run that aswell, its a huge security leak.

But the drive-by points directly at the .exe file. But You still need to press ACCEPT in order to to allow java to download the .exe file (Mostly)

Heres a drive-by:
