						&amp;&amp; !isInPitGame()) {
					sM(&quot;You Cannot attack your own clan members!&quot;);
					faceNPC(32768 + AttackingOn);

I tried this, but it seems that people wearing zammy cloak [4043] cannot attack people with sara cloak [4041], can anyone help me with this?</description>

<p>Yes but then the player can just remove their cape … But yes, i’ve already added the boolean for isincw.

<p>Thanks for the idea but I really need someone to help me with the question I asked :S</p>

<p>lmaoo, no. i mean it.</p>
<p>you have made the code correct i think, but if you cannot attack the opersite side, then change the code to opersite and try it… because then it stops attacking on your team not the other team.</p>
<p>and you are saying that you cannot attack the other team, but you can attack your own team.</p>
