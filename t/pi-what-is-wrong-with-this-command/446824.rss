I get this error. Can someone please tell me whats wrong with it. I took out the c. so its now just &quot;voteDelay&quot; and made the long.parseLong to just Long and still can&#39;t get rid of that vote error. This is the first error message, not the one I get after making my adjustments. Its the same though, the errors are in the same place.</description>

<p>I get this error. Can someone please tell me whats wrong with it. I took out the c. so its now just “voteDelay” and made the long.parseLong to just Long and still can’t get rid of that vote error. This is the first error message, not the one I get after making my adjustments. Its the same though, the errors are in the same place.</p>
