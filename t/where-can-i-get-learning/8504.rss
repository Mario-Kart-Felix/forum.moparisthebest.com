    <description>I am sick and tired of always waiting for my favortie server to come online so I decided I wanted to start learning how to edit and make my server better for myself by learning Java programming.

My question is where to start.Anyone know a site or anything thats a good started? How did you people start learning.

              <p>to craft more than 50 runes at a time, you need to edit each one. open client.java and search for<br>
// Nature rift</p>
<p>scroll down a little and you will see something like<br>
addItem(561, 100);</p>
<p>changed the 50, or whatever it is to how many runes you want to get each time.</p>
