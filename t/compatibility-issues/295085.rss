    <title>Compatibility issues?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compatibility-issues/295085</link>
    <description>OK, a quick summary of my issue before I give all the information. I just bought a Hanns G 21.5 Widescreen HDMI LCD off of newegg the other day. Shipped here, and set it up for my Xbox 360. Which all was fine and great, until now when I decide to hook it up to my Desktop.

It does display the desktop, but I&#39;m having resolution, font rendering, wallpaper, etc issues. The last one isn&#39;t an issue I just need some understanding with it. OK so, now on to the info.


[ul][*][URL=http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim2350/specs.htm#1101572]Dell Dimension 2350[/URL]
[*][URL=http://&quot;http://www1.sapphiretech.com/en/products/graphics_overview.php?gpid=59&quot;]Sapphire Radeon 9250 256MB GFX[/URL]
[*][URL=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824254039]21.5in Hanns G HDMI Widescreen LCD[/URL]
[*][URL=http://www.maginnovision.com/Products/Product.aspx?sn=465&amp;pi=1459]17in MAG Innovision LCD[/URL][/ul]


So my issue is the resolution on the new widescreen. There are no 16:9 resolutions, the max is like 1440x900, which isn&#39;t near the max on the LCD(1920x1080), and doesn&#39;t look good at all. The LCD came with some install disc, but because I don&#39;t use windows I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. I assumed really that it would just be plug and play. 

I also thought that it might be because my gfx card is so old. That maybe it can&#39;t support that size resolution. I really would like to see my Linux install in full living color.</description>

<p>yeah I meant 16:10.</p>
<p>EDIT: Can I get confirmation from anyone else, if it is in fact my graphics card being old as the culprit.</p>
