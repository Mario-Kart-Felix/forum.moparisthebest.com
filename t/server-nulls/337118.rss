    <description>Please could someone help me.

My server keeps getting nulled! Every freaking hour!!

It keeps making my server status page be uptime 99% and it&#39;s pissing me off!! Everyone keeps quitting because it&#39;s nulled SOOO much! I&#39;m sure this happens to every server but I&#39;m so tired of it! I&#39;ve set up an auto restarter every 90 minutes but THAT IS NOT ENOUGH! IT GETS NULLED IN BETWEEN THAT TIME!!!

I will be willing to pay for someone to help me fix this! Please!

Here is my status page
