    <description>Hi my name is Josh, I want to make THE best runescape private server, and I will not settle for 2Nd best.

  PROS for ME: :D

-I know basic coding! 
-I&#39;m awesome at making websites ect.
-I&#39;m a good listener and i learn fast.
-I have Skype and teamveiwer with a mic.
-I don&#39;t give up easily.
-I am compotent and clever, Meaning i will not just give out staff to anyone.  :eek:[/font]

The kind of person i am looking for: :)
-You [u][b]Must[/b][/u] be committed and doesn&#39;t give up if there is a hard problem to solve. 
-You [u][b]Should[/b][/u] have Skype and or Teamveiwer. ( Preferbaly with a mic so i can speak to you.)
-You [u][b]Should[/b][/u] me compotent and good at coding as I only know basic stuff!
-You [u][b]Must[/b][/u] be easy to get along with.
-You [u][b]Must[/b][/u] have good communication skills.
-You [u][b]Should[/b][/u] have cool ideas that people have not implemented into a RSPS yet!

<p>Why is everyone trolling on me? i said i would pick it up. you’ve go to start somewhere. and it least i’m not wasting your time as i am being honest. geeze. websites are harder to make than you think for a start. and i can do BASIC coding so if i’m honest he/She wouldn’t have to do everything. But yes i do agree coding is hard.</p>
