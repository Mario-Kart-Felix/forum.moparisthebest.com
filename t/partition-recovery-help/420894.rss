    <title>Partition recovery help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/partition-recovery-help/420894</link>
    <description>I need to know of a linux utility that will allow me to recover a ntfs filesystem. I created a VM HDD from a physical HDD using VMwares converted program. it kept all the data and partitions from the actual HDD but the only partition with a known format is the primary OS the others are listed as unknown FS types in gparted.

I believe i can just simply use some linux utility to declare this partition, i need, as ntfs since that is what the partition was. I know there are these types of utilities out there b/c ive used them b4 I just cant remember what they were called and I am apparently not typing the correct words in google to find these utilities.

I downloaded parted magic b/c i thought that i had used that to recover a HDD i screwed up but after using it i dont think that that is what i used. what ever program i used was a live cd distro that allowed me to fix the partition table of the HDD.

need a speedy reply thank you

edit: i was just looking at diskpart in windows 7 since that is the vms guest OS. I believe i can acomplish what i need to do from windows but idk the commands to do so. under diskpart the partitions fs type is raw; i thought i could do set id=07 but that didnt do anything.</description>

              <p>ok. well my windows 7 data is all backed up in a windows back up. if i mess up i guess ill just have to install windows 7 pro 64 and use a key i have for it but then ill have to find all the drivers which will be a pain. thx for the help.</p>
<p>edit: everything seems to be working fine but why did all the partition table data change when all i did was change the type of one partition?</p>
<p>i deleted the partition so i can try to recreate the partition now? do i have enough info to recreate it? it starts at 3084480, but how would i find the size? end-start*512? when i looked at the partition thru a GUI-based program(e.g. gparted) said it was 9.25Gigs i never knew the exact size.</p>
<p>i decided im just going to say screw it. install windows 7 pro 64, then see if i can get the data from my classmates laptops recovery partition, since they are both toshiba satalites. hoping that it will have most of the drivers i need for mine.</p>

              <p>ok so what u r saying is use “fdisk /dev/sda2” record the partition data(where it starts and its size) the type d, then the partition number, then type n, p, 2, first cylinder, and then +size, t, 2, 7, w?</p>
<p>also do it make the difference if the partition was a hidden ntfs or not? im guessing(I think i remember seeing in gparted it being hidden) it was hidden since it didnt show up in windows explorer.</p>
<p>this partition im trying to recover is the recover partition to my laptop. I should have backed it up b4 i wiped my hdd but i figured i didnt need it then so i would just recover it when i needed it(which i didnt think would be in like 2 weeks i wasnt planning on needing it again)… but i have to use microsoft project 2010 for school and it isnt compatible with xp 64… everyday i dont have it running and using it my grade gets lower. I wish he would have let use choose what project management software we wanted to use, but oh well.</p>
<p>edit: would using gparted to delete the partition then recreate it have the same effect or not? b/c i really dont want to lose this data.</p>
<p>this is what the disk info originally said:<br>
“/dev/sda1  1  192  1542208+  27  Hidden NTFS WinRE<br>
/dev/sda2  193  1400  9703260  7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT<br>
/dev/sda3  1401  36365  280856362+  7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT”</p>
<p>i changed the type to 17 with: t, 2, 17</p>
<p>then i checked to see what happened it looked like this: “/dev/sda2  193  1400  9703260  17  Hidden HPFS/NTFS”</p>
<p>so seeing that i did “w”.</p>
<p>reopened fdisk to check again and this is what it says:<br>
“/dev/sda1  63  3084479  1542208+  27  Hidden NTFS WinRE<br>
/dev/sda2  3084480  22490999  9703260  17  Hidden HPFS/NTFS<br>
/dev/sda3  22491000  584203724  280856362+  7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT”</p>
<p>what happened? looking at that i think its f’ed up now.</p>

              <p>I know in the exact case you are talking about, you can destroy the partition with fdisk, and recreate it on the EXACT same cylinder boundaries and set it to whatever type you like, but you have to be very careful, because if you are off by 1 you may lose everything.</p>

              <p>All I’ve been able to find about using fdisk is formatting and stuff. I haven’t been able to find how to set the partition type. I think I’m talking about data recovery, but if fixing a partition falls under partition management than I guess its partition management. The data I know is there nothing has happened to the partition except when I cloned my harddrive the partition type didn’t come with the data.</p>
<p>Gparted sees that there is a partition there it just doesn’t know what filesystem it is but ik that it is ntfs. I was thinking I could use gparted to delete the partition from the partition table b/c all the data is still there its just in unallocated space, right? Then I was going to use a windows utility to recover/fix the ntfs partition. If I formatted the partition to ntfs it would erase all the data, right?</p>
