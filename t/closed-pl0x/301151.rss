              <p>I remember I got tired of this guy begging me for donations so I gave him 20 bucks on paypal. A couple days later I’m perm banned for minus repping one of his boyfriends on the forum. Then the ban message is him going nuts that he has my cash and I’m banned. He got so giddy over 20 dollars that I know he’s never had a job before.</p>
