              <p>God… I used to be like that. But then, I figured out how much of a noob I am for even asking those stuff. Why would WoW make a class that is better than all of the others? They wouldn’t do that. Actually, the best class is what you like best. If you play a class you don’t like, you will treat it under and won’t play with it as much. But if you play a class you do like, mine being the rogue, then it will be easier for you because you enjoy playing with it. (Don’t be sick minded.)</p>

Whatever you do - don’t go shaman. What do you like to play as on other games? A person that takes damage? A meat sheild? A spellcaster who can deal lots of damage? Pain inflicted apon enemies as magic spells slowly eat them away?<br>
[/quote]<br>
whats wrong with shaman?[/quote]</p>
<p>yeah shamans are pimping</p>
<p>&lt;3 rogues though yeah they are easy to play but they are so much fun at level 70 plus you can easily gank a warlock on a rogue (unless you suck ass)</p>
<p>and LOL at the mage keyboard that is so true <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>The last time I used the female counterpart to a male’s name in an effort to diss was in first grade.  Grow up.  Learn that the amount of money your parents make has nothing to do with your personal ability, and everything to do with a false sense of self-worth.</p>
