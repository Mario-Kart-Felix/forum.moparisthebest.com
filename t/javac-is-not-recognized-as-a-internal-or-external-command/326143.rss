    <title>&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as a internal or external command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/javac-is-not-recognized-as-a-internal-or-external-command/326143</link>
    <description>Ok, So, when I go into my command prop and type in javac, it says &#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as a internal or external command, operable program, or batch file. Wheneber i looked in my java folder, I dont even see javac in there... And know, ever since I&#39;ve tryed to download java and all that, Ipconfig isnt a command either. Im using java 6u18.
Someone help?</description>

Make sure you have downloaded JDK and have JRE. If you have them and it’s still not working then you must set your Environmental Variables. There’s a tutorial on starting a private server, I would read that to learn how to set them if I were you.<br>

Alright, you may have them downloaded, but as stated before I say to set your Environmental Variables. If you have then please tell me.</p>
