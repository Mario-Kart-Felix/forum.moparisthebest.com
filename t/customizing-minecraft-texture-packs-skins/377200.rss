    <title>Customizing Minecraft [Texture Packs + Skins]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/customizing-minecraft-texture-packs-skins/377200</link>
    <description>It&#39;s always a load of fun to customize, and Minecraft allows you to do so in a few ways. If I leave anything out, please let me know and I will add it! 

[u][b]Note[/b][/u]: These are just random texture packs I selected for examples, they are not necessarily my favorites or ones I recommend. (Except the very last one)


[size=18pt][u][b]Texture Packs[/b][/u][/size]

Texture packs are a great way to control how you want your game to feel. Basically these packs will modify the default textures of the Minecraft world, so it&#39;s a must that your client is using the default textures before you install/use a texture pack. But I&#39;ll get into that more later.

A [b]much[/b] more complete list of texture packs can be found here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewforum.php?f=1021


To start, let&#39;s take a look at some of the [b]default[/b] textures of Minecraft

Now let&#39;s take a look at what happens when we apply a texture pack. This one is called Doku RPG v1.2, and can be found [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=25676]here[/url]

[img]http://i.imgur.com/wpSk5.png[/img]

Very different, right? As you can see it almost gives the feel of an entirely new game, and some people love this. This particular one still resembles Minecraft for the most part, but there are some that go for completely different looks than the default textures.



For example, this next one is called Mine Effect and is a recreation of the game Mass Effect.

I believe this one is still in development, but you can find the topic for it and an incomplete download for it [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=76119]here[/url]



Another example of texture packs that differ greatly from the default textures would be Super MarioCraft 64, which can be found [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=19500]here[/url]

[img]http://i.imgur.com/qPgXP.png[/img]

You&#39;ll notice that like in Mine effect, this texture pack gives drastic changes to the default look. 



Now let&#39;s move into some more &quot;Minecraft looking&quot; packs. I&#39;m just going to list them because there really isn&#39;t that much to say about them.

Mixcraft, found [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1021&amp;t=31331]here[/url]

[img]http://i.imgur.com/o39Wb.png[/img]

This one is a pretty popular one, and you can see that it makes some pretty heavy changes. Christmas theme, although I think you can get one without the modified flowers/saplings. I love the changes to the tools on this one, as seen in the action bar.



For me personally, I like the game to feel like the original Minecraft. I don&#39;t personally like to use anything besides the default, although some of them are very well done. It&#39;s just personal preference. Luckily, I did find a texture pack that is the default textures but in HD. It&#39;s the one I currently use.

Very similar to the default, but much sharper and nicer! I recommend this one for those that don&#39;t want to lose the feel of the original game.


[u][b][size=14pt]Installing Your Texture Pack[/size][/b][/u]

Installing your pack can sometimes be tricky, but I guarantee you can eventually get it working without much effort. A lot of times directions for installation will come with the download, and if you want just go ahead and follow those. For those that want an alternative way, this is how I install my packs.

[b]1)[/b] First thing&#39;s first, you&#39;re going to need the HD texture pack fix, which can be downloaded for:

     - [u][b]Windows[/b][/u]:[url=http://github.com/downloads/pclewis/mcpatcher/mcpatcher-1.1.10_01.exe]here[/url]
     - [u][b]Mac[/b][/u]:[url=http://github.com/downloads/pclewis/mcpatcher/mcpatcher-1.1.10_01.dmg]here[/url]
     - [u][b]Anyone else[/b][/u] (I hope):[url=http://github.com/downloads/pclewis/mcpatcher/mcpatcher-1.1.10_01.jar]here[/url]

and the support for it found [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1021&amp;t=46173]here[/url]

[b]2)[/b] Next, make sure that your Minecraft client is currently using the default textures. If it&#39;s not, or if you&#39;re somehow unsure, navigate to your .minecraft folder and delete the [b]bin[/b] folder. Then, relaunch Minecraft, sign in, and it should re-download the bin folder. Now you&#39;re using the default textures

[u][b]NOTE[/b][/u]: I have only tested this with a premium (paid) account. I am not sure if this method works with cracked clients, and in fact I doubt it would work. If using a cracked client, I would suggest copying your bin folder BEFORE you change from the default textures, and then using that to overwrite the modified one when you need to switch back to default.

[b]3)[/b] Now run the HD texture pack fix/patcher. If the file fields are not automatically filled in, hit the top browse button and find your minecraft.jar

[b]4)[/b] Hit the browse button next to &quot;Texture Pack&quot; and find the .zip file for the texture pack you want to use.

[b]5)[/b] Click patch

[b]6)[/b] When it&#39;s done, click Test Minecraft. If it doesn&#39;t work, follow [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1021&amp;t=46173]this[/url] link. If it does, you can launch Minecraft normally.




[size=18pt][u][b]Skins[/b][/u][/size]

A skin is basically the look of your Minecraft character.

[img]http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:GRt2SSf4UDMZmM:http://www.deviantart.com/download/174220953/New_Minecraft_Hexed_Skins_by_Dragoshi1.jpg&amp;t=1[/img]

Unfortunately, the only way (as far as I know) to have a custom skin is to have a premium (paid) Minecraft account. For those that don&#39;t, you&#39;re out of luck. If you do have a paid account however, getting a skin is extremely simple. 

1) Head on over to www.minecraft.net

2) Sign in

3) Find the Navbar at the top of the page, click profile. Here you should see a picture of your current skin.

4) Click the &quot;browse&quot; button, select your skin (the png file), and hit &quot;upload image&quot; 

It&#39;s as simple as that. If you need to [i]find[/i] a skin, here&#39;s a list: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewforum.php?f=27
