    <title>Client Short and Icon</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-short-and-icon/453495</link>
    <description>I really haven&#39;t seen much about this, so i thought i would make a quick and easy tutorial to help people make their clients easier to use :D

difficulty - 2 / 10
this tut. is designed for windows. 

This will teach you how to make an icon and short cut for your client so you can drag it to their desktop and will have more ease in playing!

This tut. assumes you have a client already. 

step 1) download gimp - http://www.gimp.org/

step 2) start up gimp and select file -&gt; new

step 3) i used the default dimensions for this. ( you can use what ever you want, remember to consider shrinking later on- so easy on text) 

step 4) make a design for your icon, i prefer to use the background for the clients log in screen, on deltascape&#39;s client it was deltascape.jpg in the client files, but this is my preference, you can make it what ever you want. i do suggest not using text becuase you will be shrinking the image to 48x48 and no writing will be readable!

... 20 sum steps making your image :D?!

step 27) after you have your image and are ready to go, click on the toolbar at the top image -&gt; scale image

step 28 ) click the little chain, this will break scaling.

step 29 ) make the width 48 and the height 48 and click scale.

step 30) click file -&gt; save as ( save it somewhere you can find it! ) and name it myicon.ico ( or whatever you want, just make sure the last part is .ico that is the icon file type ) 

step 31) the hard is over! now take the new icon and drop it into your client folder if you didn&#39;t save it there. 

step 32) right click the run.bat in your client and click create shortcut.

step 33) right click the short cut, should be right above it. and click properties, now you will see something that says change icon close to the bottom in the shortcut tab. 

click it.

step 34) click browse and chose the new icon we made that is located in your client folder. then click apply then okay.

step 35) right click the short cut and rename it yourserver  client

step 36) drag it to your desktop and try it out! 

if it opened your client then are good :D! 

** this is meant for a short cut for YOUR computer, this is a non-transferable shortcut. This is to make your life easier, if you want a short cut for other people then just include this next part in a text file in your client along with a pre-made icon for them to use-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a short cut for the client!

step 1) right click the run.bat in the client folder and right click create shortcut.

step 2) right click the short cut, should be right above it. and click properties, now you will see something that says change icon close to the bottom in the shortcut tab. 

click it.

step 3) click browse and choose the icon that is located in the client folder. then click apply then okay.

step 4) right click the short cut and rename it Server Client

step 5) drag it to your desktop and try it out!

              <p>Unless you want to DL a file converter then the gimp part if very helpful, i also added it because i still people using MS paint… and the section you linked is for client hacking, sorry for posting in the wrong section if i did, it’s just one of those in between kind of topics.</p>
<p>When releasing your server, if you do, you can change the run icon on your server, just adds a neat little effect most people skip over <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
