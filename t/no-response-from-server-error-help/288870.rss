    <description>Hey guys..
Before you say anything, [b]I used search before posting this[/b], and all I could find were nooby posts about their &#39;mopar servers&#39;, connecting to other servers, an how it always came up with &quot;error connecting to server&quot;....

Anyways, mines different..

[u]Source[/u]: RichScape
[u]Problem[/u]: I was testing out the Anti-SYI on my server just now and I forgot to change the name of the spam bot [b]from[/b] SYIpkpker to something random, hence Ipbanning myself (lol)..

Anyway, when I went to log in it came up with: 
[code]&quot;Error connecting to server. Please try using a different world&quot;[/code]
So I thought &#39;oh yea, I&#39;ll just delete my Ip from IPbanned.txt and it&#39;ll be back to normal&#39;.
So I deleted my IP from IPbanned.txt, but it still comes up with the same error and preventing me from logging onto my server.

Is anyone able to help me with this?

Also, when I use my &#39;backup&#39; server it&#39;s fine, but it&#39;s not as recent as what I&#39;d like, and using this instead would cause me to lose a heap of work...


Help appreciated..</description>
