    <title>Environmental Variable Help. (Help getting run.bat to work in my Client)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/environmental-variable-help-help-getting-run-bat-to-work-in-my-client/364234</link>
    <description>(I posted this in client help because my client won&#39;t run, if this is the wrong section, feel free to move/lock this.)

K, well. I have Windows Vista 64-Bit Operating System.
I&#39;ve tried setting my Environmental Variables (EV for short) For A couple days now, and it&#39;s pissing me off.  Nothing will work.  .exe files used to work, I messed with some Variables, now NO .exe or .bat files will work whilst Trying to run my client.

Can someone tell me what my CLASSPATH and path EV&#39;s SHOULD look like?  Remember, I dunno if this makes a difference, but it is windows Vista. (Tbh, Vista fails, I know).  
And yes, I have tried Environmental Variable setter on my computer, but it will not run.

so TY if you could help.  Yes I know I am a noob.</description>
