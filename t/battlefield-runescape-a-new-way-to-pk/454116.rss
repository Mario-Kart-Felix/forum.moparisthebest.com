    <title>BattleField Runescape - A New Way to PK</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/battlefield-runescape-a-new-way-to-pk/454116</link>
    <description>Well Ive spent a lot of time working on this but that time has just finally run out. I leave for college in a couple of weeks and I started working on my own game and ended up making some good progress. Because of these reasons, I am releasing BFRS for the final time.

I really hope some one can take this and finish it. Please. I spent a lot of time on this and I would love it if it came to be something.

Please excuse some of the messy code, a few bits are two years old at this point and I have learned a lot since then.

The base is Hyperion.

For those who dont know what this is, heres the project thread.

Ive been working on this for quite some time and figured I might as well post it here. Some one mentioned an other version potentially being here and I did release it open source a while ago so I figured I&#39;d post my latest version.

[B]
[size=24pt][COLOR=red]What is BattleField Runescape?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
So what is BFRS(BattleField RuneScape) you ask? Well it is a long running project that I have been working on to change runescape into a full on PVP game. However, it is nothing like your standard PVP servers. 
The idea of BFRS, is that i follow the ideas and guidelines of common First Person Shooters, while still staying 3rd person. 
The Battlefield series serves as the greatest influence, however there are many other ideas that are taken from other games as well.

[B]
[SIZE=24pt][COLOR=red]What Makes It Unique?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
EVERYTHING! Its what you might call a &quot;partial&quot; Total Conversion.(A Total Conversion, in a basic sense, is when you take the engine of a game, and change it into a completely different game.) 
Many of the models will stay the same so it is not a full Total Conversion. There have been some very large changes though to just about everything else.

[B][SIZE=24pt][COLOR=red]How Have The Looks Changed?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
The looks of BFRS were a huge part of the initial development for me. I wanted to make sure the game looked good, even before I was working on the functionality of it.

[B][SIZE=18pt][COLOR=red]Sprites[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
Almost all of the sprites have been created by me for the game.(You will see in some pictures there are still a few stock runescape ones)
Over 120 Sprites have been made so far, and that number should reach a little over 150 by the time the game is 100% completed.

Rouge Soul

Tank Soul
[IMG]http://i211.photobucket.com/albums/bb316/pilldom/RougeSoul.png[/img]
Healer Soul
[IMG]http://i211.photobucket.com/albums/bb316/pilldom/healersprites.png[/img]

[B][SIZE=18pt][COLOR=red]The BFRS Pro Client[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
There are two client versions for BFRS. The standard one that has the sprites and such but looks somewhat like your standard 317 client other than that.
Then there is the Pro Client, which has been designed specifically with ease of use in mind.
It has two tab windows instead of one, is 1050x800, allows you to change the camera angle, and contains 11 brand new interfaces for the game.

[IMG]http://i211.photobucket.com/albums/bb316/pilldom/bfrsnew.png[/img]

[B][SIZE=18pt][COLOR=red]The Secondary Interface[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
The secondary interface is an interface that pops up when something has happened. In other words, if you kill a player, the interface will appear on the middle of your screen for 7 seconds, detailing who you just killed. 
It will inform you of kills, assists, objectives, and other still unannounced things. :p
It also shows how much xp you earned from your endeavor.

[IMG]http://i211.photobucket.com/albums/bb316/pilldom/secondaryinterfacev2.png[/img]

[B][SIZE=18pt][COLOR=red]What Is Soul?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
Soul is the replacement of prayer. There are 4 classes, each has their own unique soul abilities. 
So at the start of the game when you choose your class, you will gain the soul abilities of the class you chose.
All of the soul abilities though have level requirements. Each player also has a limited amount of soul.
How much soul a player has is based on their level in the class they are currently playing on. So if a player is level 30, then they start with 30 soul.
If they then use an ability that requires a rouge level of 27, then their soul drops down to 3.
Soul however, regenerates over time, and they will soon be able to use the abilities again.


[B][SIZE=18pt][COLOR=red]Soul[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
Soul is similar to prayer. Your soul level changes though based on what class you are using, as your soul is the level you are in a particular class. When you use a soul ability, your soul is drained. 
The drain amount is the level that is required to use the specific ability. Every class has their own soul abilities.

[B][SIZE=18pt][COLOR=red]Classes[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
As I mentioned above there are classes.
The game has four classes,
-Rouge
-Tank
-Healer
-Hybrid
Each has 12 unique soul abilities.
They also have have other restrictions as well, regarding amour usage, and weapon usage.
For example a tank can not use a bow, and cannot wear mage armour. 
The level of a class, may also effect whether or not a player can use a particular piece of amour. A whip requires 70 attack for example, along with a rouge level of 70. If you are a tank, a whip requires 70 attack again, but a tank level of 95.

[B][SIZE=14pt][COLOR=red]The Rouge[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
Wears lighter armour, uses weapons such as daggers and scimitars. Abilities are more about hitting fast and disabling the enemy.

[B][SIZE=14pt][COLOR=red]The Healer[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]

[B][SIZE=24pt]
[COLOR=red]So How Do I Play?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
BFRS is a fairly simple game. The entire game takes place in castle wars.
You will spawn in the castle wars building, where the bank, shops and other players can be found. 
Once you are equipped, you can start playing by clicking on any of the castle wars portals, where the lobby system kicks in. 

[B][SIZE=18pt]
[COLOR=red]The Lobby System[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
The lobby system allows for their to be 3 games running, or in waiting, at any given time. What type of game the lobby has is random and is changed after a game finishes. There are 8 different game types.

[ul][*]Capture the Flag
[*][COLOR=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;]Team DeathMatch[/COLOR]
[*]Free for All DeathMatch
[*][COLOR=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;]Conquest[/COLOR]
[*]Search and Destroy
[*]Infection
[*]Siege
[*]Head Quarters[/ul]

When you find a game you like, you can either choose to join in the middle(if there is room) or join a game that is in the waiting room and talk to people for the 3 minutes.
Once you have chosen a game you would like to play, you will be teleported to the lobby for the game mode(if it is in waiting, other wise you will be teleported into the game). 
The lobby is exactly the same as the main lobby, but it is a 4 height levels up, so you will only see players that are also waiting in that lobby with you. Your game will also then take place 4 height levels up, to allow for multiple games on the same level.

[IMG]http://i211.photobucket.com/albums/bb316/pilldom/lobby.png[/img]

[B][SIZE=18pt]
[COLOR=red]Has Skilling Changed?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
BFRS is made to be a pking server. Thats why the only 5 returning skills from runescape are the combat skills.(Attack, Strength, Defence, Magic, Range) There are four new skills. 
These are the tank, rogue, healer and hybrid skills. Which represent your level in a specific class.

[B][SIZE=18pt]
[COLOR=red]How Do I Train My Skills?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
The 5 combat skills train in the same way they did in runescape, you attack some one, you get xp. Your class rank is different however. When you kill a player, capture an objective, earn a medal, or another accomplishment, you will earn xp in the class you are currently using. How important you were in killing some one, and how big of an objective it was, and medal dependencies, determine how much xp is earned.
[B][SIZE=18pt]
[COLOR=red]How Do I Earn Money?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
Money is earned in a very similar way as class experience, it is more objective orientated though.
Killing and objectives are the two ways in which you earn money. How important you were in killing some one, and how big of an objective it was, determine how much xp is earned.
[B][SIZE=18pt]
[COLOR=red]What Happens When I Die?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
Upon death you will be teleported back to the spawn point of your team. Here you can change your class if you want, and then jump back into the fray. A death interface will pop up before hand though, detailing what happened your last life.

[IMG]http://i211.photobucket.com/albums/bb316/pilldom/deathscreen.png[/img]

[B][SIZE=18pt]
[COLOR=red]What Happens When the Game Ends?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
At the end of the game you will be taken back to the main lobby. Any experience and xp you earned will be kept and added to the official stat tracker. An interface will also display showing your personal stats from the game, as well as who the mvp was. (MVP is always based on xp earned, never on kills)
[IMG]http://i211.photobucket.com/albums/bb316/pilldom/PostGame.png[/img]
[B][SIZE=18pt]
[COLOR=red]How Does Eating Work?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
There is no eating in BFRS. Rather, if you are the healing class, you can use your soul abilities to &quot;spawn&quot; healing potions. The power of the potion depends on what soul ability you used. You also gain a small amount of xp for healing players.
