        <p>i can answer the somewhat of your questions… the rs game engine has changed so much, we can’t find an relations to rename stuff and understand stuff… like when we updated aryan, the aryan updater searched through the rs deob and removed teh traps, and renames strings and variables… aryan used these strings and variables and stuff to run, like maybe the rs client said class5_sub45 or something, and what ever that did the aryan updater would rename it to what ever it did so maybe if it handled login code then it may be changed thru the hole deob to login or something, well… now… from some deobs and bytecode editing, the same strings aren’t in the same places… and most people can’t even get a deob to look thru the code! it is obufuscated or basically encrypted… jagex’s obufucater must be a custom made 1 because they used to use ZKM(Zeliz Klassmaster) and many people has written zkmstrippers that took off the zkm obufuscating… and we could succesfully decomile it and read it! thus where we had rs bots! If we can’t deobufuscate, then we can’t decomile, and we can’t read the source… IF u try to use the zkm stripper on the current rs classfiles, it brings up lots of errors and can’t make anything of it… same if u try to decomile it… most people used Jad - Fast Java Decompiler but it can’t get much from decompiling… If u had jsut decompiled the old rs engine u would get what was called an unrenamed deob, it still had the zkm encryption on, but it was better than nothing… now we can’t really get much from decompiling, so now really what is left is bytecode editing… It is where the .class file’s bytecode is decompiled to a .j file, basically some java assembly… we can get the rs client connected to login via bytecode editing and some what of edits… like changing “Welcome to RuneScape” can be change via bytecode editing…</p>
<p>hope this helps u a bit…<br>

        <p>Wow! Thanks for the detailed discription of the problem.</p>
<blockquote>when we updated aryan, the aryan updater searched through the rs deob and removed teh traps, and renames strings and variables...</blockquote>
You mentioned in the beginning of the post that the aryan updater used to remove traps. What exactly do you mean by traps and are these now obfuscated, making it difficult to bot using java? Is there any reason to rename strings and variables besides for own preferences?
<p>Also, does it impede upon a java programmer exactly how the RS client is working? Is it not possible to do something similar to what SCAR does with java where the java client would simply control mouse and keyboard functions instead of playing with how the client actually runs?</p>
<blockquote>and most people can't even get a deob to look thru the code! it is obufuscated or basically encrypted... jagex's obufucater must be a custom made 1 because they used to use ZKM(Zeliz Klassmaster) and many people has written zkmstrippers that took off the zkm obufuscating.. and we could succesfully decomile it and read it! thus where we had rs bots!</blockquote>
Again, why do we need to know the details of how the java code in the RS client is operating to make bots at the java level?
<p>Thanks so much for your time and help.</p>

<p>If you did that, what would the point of using Java be? Several other languages are much better at that sort of thing. If I wanted a color clicker, I would use SCAR, as I have no particular desire to reinvent <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> wheel, and it would be faster and have more features from years of development than I could stick in a Java-based copy before I completely lost interest in competing.</p>
<p>No, we use Java because hacking the client itself allows our bots to draw information from the client in a much more direct and efficient way. Unfortunately, it is also more intrusive and therefore more detectable - therein lies one of our current problems. But you’re right, current botting philosophy says that all you need is mouse and keyboard control plus information about the game state. The big differences occur in how that information is obtained - in the past SCAR and client hacks have had their advantages and disadvantages, but right now SCAR is the only one in stable condition.</p>
<p>I have no idea if that addressed anything you wanted to know, but caffeine is bad at answering questions.</p>

        <p>WEll i think this topic has been answered good, and im about to go out to eat  so i want to say this: There are people claming to have deobs… i beilive some of them because in fact they have posted them… I have seen the new engine deob, but i know it wasn’t the most recent version of the new engine… If u compared the 2 different engines, u could tell that they are very much differnt… all of the variables are strewn about like, used to be “welcome to runescape” used to be in client.java and so did the login methods as well as the logos and backgrounds… well… after searching thru the deobs all these methods are mixed up into all the classes… im positive that the variables i stated aren’t in the client.java/.class anymore! Like i said in my first post, the only way we are currently able to use java bots are bytecode editing and applet hijacking, stuff like that… ARGA like aryan, used accessormethods to interface with the client, now, ARGA has to use applethacjacking to worldswitch, it is still very easy, but still annoying that we have to use external classes to get to the job done… If u have an Rs-resources account and u go to the rs2 cheating section u can see a preview of my bot, it uses modified classes from aryan to world switch but my scripting engine is different… I has to use external classes to get the worldswitching and scriptingengine in(obviously for them both cause no deob) but, using these external classes, is still very affective, the only problem is there is still traps in the rs client!!! so, if i wanted to auto in my bot i must use a noob acc and proxies! other wise i will get ip banned along with me account! If u login to a noob acc on their, expect him to be banned within a few days</p>

        <p>[quote=“Krichevskoy, post:6, topic:4563”]If you did that, what would the point of using Java be? Several other languages are much better at that sort of thing. If I wanted a color clicker, I would use SCAR, as I have no particular desire to reinvent <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> wheel, and it would be faster and have more features from years of development than I could stick in a Java-based copy before I completely lost interest in competing.</p>
<p>No, we use Java because hacking the client itself allows our bots to draw information from the client in a much more direct and efficient way. Unfortunately, it is also more intrusive and therefore more detectable - therein lies one of our current problems. But you’re right, current botting philosophy says that all you need is mouse and keyboard control plus information about the game state. The big differences occur in how that information is obtained - in the past SCAR and client hacks have had their advantages and disadvantages, but right now SCAR is the only one in stable condition.</p>
<p>I have no idea if that addressed anything you wanted to know, but caffeine is bad at answering questions.[/quote]</p>
<p>Aha! Thank you. That has answered my question completely… well almost. How do these deobs work and how do they explain to us what is happening at the method level on the RS Client?</p>
<p>I see the purpose in trying to understand that functions of the RS Client so that we can better run bots but what information do these deobs provide that allows us to do so and how are they going about obtaining this information?</p>
<p>vbcoderx has mentioned a few times now the necessity of looking at byte code. Since you, Krichevskoy seem a bit more able to explain these things, do you think you could reiterate for him what the use of looking at byte code is and how it is allowing us to determine how the functions of the RS client are running.</p>
<p>Also, when we run java bot clients, what kind of inputs and outputs are being recieved? I’m having a slight difficulty in understanding what our programs and methods are actually doing and how they’re communicating with the RS clients.</p>

<p>A deob works just like the normal client Jagex uses, except it isn’t obfuscated. So it’s essentially the same  client, renamed and reorganized.  It’s extremely difficult to tell what methods are doing and how the client works when you are looking at it in obfuscated form. Take a look at the before and after examples of some simple java code, to get a better idea at what simple obfuscation is:</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p>int i=11;<br>
while (i &lt; 8003) {<br>
… A[(i-3)/8] …;<br>
i += 8;</p>
<p>After:</p>
<p>int i = 1;<br>
while (i &lt; 1000) {<br>
… A[i] …;<br>
i ++;<br>
}</p>

<blockquote>I see the purpose in trying to understand that functions of the RS Client so that we can better run bots but what information do these deobs provide that allows us to do so and how are they going about obtaining this information?</blockquote>
<p>They simply make the code of client lucid so we can use the methods, for example, mouseclick, or whatever, that we want to use.</p>
<blockquote>vbcoderx has mentioned a few times now the necessity of looking at byte code.

<p>When a java program is compiled it becomes a .class file. Each method in a class is represented by the code, which is a set of instructions for the java virtual machine. The bytecode is very small, hence the small size of .class files.</p>

<p>Our programs and bots usually <span class="bbcode-b">are</span> clients, albeit heavily modified clients.</p>

<p>So how do you create a deob of a client?<br>
With obfuscations, does the RS client simply know that some of the methods are altered and will be written in irregular ways and thus reads them in a manner different from what would normally be read?</p>
<blockquote>When a java program is compiled it becomes a .class file. Each method in a class is represented by the code, which is a set of instructions for the java virtual machine. The bytecode is very small, hence the small size of .class files.</blockquote>
Sure that seems simple enough but is it necessary to look at the byte code of the class files? Can we not just decompile those classes or is that when we get a deal of gibberish because of the obfuscations that Jagex has enacted?
<blockquote>Our programs and bots usually [b]are[/b] clients, albeit heavily modified clients.</blockquote>
So then the inputs our clients recieve are directly from Jagex? Are you saying we're really just remaking Runescape and sending packets to Jagex that are similar (hopefully identical?) to those that the normal RS client would send?
<p>Thanks as well for your help on this matter. I realize it can be annoying to teach a noobie some of those things which seem so obvious to you.</p>

        <blockquote>So how do you create a deob of a client?</blockquote>
<p>You save the client from <a href="http://runescape.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Runescape.com</a> to your computer. Then you rename and deobfuscate it.</p>
<blockquote>With obfuscations, does the RS client simply know that some of the methods are altered and will be written in irregular ways and thus reads them in a manner different from what would normally be read?</blockquote>
<p>Nope, it reads them in the same way. As per my example , the two pieces of code mean the <span class="bbcode-b">exact same thing when read by the compiler</span>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int i=11;
while (i &lt; 8003) {
  ... A[(i-3)/8] ...;
  i += 8;</code></pre>
<p>=</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int i = 1;
while (i &lt; 1000) {
  ... A ...;
  i ++;
}</code></pre>
<p>So whether you have something called “Method356” or “NPCarmmovementhandler” as long as it is called the same thing and does the same thing, it doesn’t matter what you call it. Except not only does Jagex (or rather, the computer program Jagex uses to obfuscate their program) change the name of the methods, they change the entire heirarchy of the program, which makes it very hard to understand or modify. Once again, obfuscation is hiding the true form of the code, smokes and mirrors, and occasionally more complicated things like control flow abstraction etc.</p>
<blockquote>Sure that seems simple enough but is it necessary to look at the byte code of the class files? Can we not just decompile those classes or is that when we get a deal of gibberish because of the obfuscations that Jagex has enacted?</blockquote>
<p>Using the bytecode makes more sense because it is a more direct way of doing things and creating a new obfuscator would be extremely time-consuming since Jagex could break it again quickly and easily with new ways of obfuscation. Bytecode manipulation is doing things on a higher level, manipulating raw code that Jagex can’t obfuscate.</p>
<blockquote>So then the inputs our clients recieve are directly from Jagex? Are you saying we're really just remaking Runescape and sending packets to Jagex that are similar (hopefully identical?) to those that the normal RS client would send?</blockquote>
<p>Yes. And they are identical, otherwise…instant ban. Packet editors went out with Autorune a few years ago ;).</p>
<blockquote>Thanks as well for your help on this matter. I realize it can be annoying to teach a noobie some of those things which seem so obvious to you.</blockquote>
<p>No, the pleasure is all mine. Being a noob is a mindset, not a level of experience with a programming language, and you sir are not a noob.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Yes, you would need to create a program the looks for patterns and renames and reorganizes code for you (a deobber, to use the parlance of our times) to make it a true obfuscated client, though you could get it to recompile and connect just by decompiling and making some dirty hacks and some simple deobfuscation. However, much of the code would still be indecipherable to you, even if the client did work.</p>
<p>Saev’s deobber doesn’t work for many reasons. The patterns it’s looking for may or may not exist, but it will never find them. Trying to use Savions deobber for the newest client is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.</p>
<p>This is probably the future of making sustainable bots and clients, bytecode libraries:</p>

If the latter, please elaborate a little bit <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Saevion’s program doesn’t work for three reasons that I’ve found:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It can longer find the control variable upon with the ZKM-created opaque predicates are based. This is a result of a (possibly unintentional) interaction between ZKM and whatever program Jagex is using to scramble variable locations. Saevion’s “zkmstripper” transformer depends on its ControlFinder to locate opaque predicates. The particular ControlFinder that saevion created (“CPControlFinder”) just checks the final (<span class="bbcode-i">constantpool.getSize() - 1</span>) entry in the main class (i.e., <span class="bbcode-i">client</span>) constant pool. This works fine against Zelix alone because that’s usually where it puts the variable. However, Jagex’s additional scrambling changes that location and CPControlFinder fails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn’t address all the obfuscation. Even if “zkmstripper” works perfectly, the classes are still hopelessly scrambled. In addition, I’ve heard that it breaks audio support in the client (I usually provide my own music, so I have no idea if it’s true or not).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code produced does not compile without renaming. I haven’t got a clue what causes this, but if you try to compile the code that JAD gives you without running the deobfuscated client through Zelix (or whatever you rename with), you get compiler-stopping numbers of errors about dereferencing a variable. I don’t see where it’s being dereferenced, so the only thing I can imagine is a name conflict of some sort (which I also haven’t found).</p>
</li>
</ol>

If you were to run the client obfuscated, would it still return the proper packets to the Runescape servers?</p>
<p>[quote=“PaulT, post:11, topic:4563”]Nope, it reads them in the same way. As per my example , the two pieces of code mean the <span class="bbcode-b">exact same thing when read by the compiler</span>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int i=11;

<p>=</p>
<p><code>
int i = 1;

Ok, I finally figured out why I was having problems understanding that example. I think there is an error in the example =oP<br>
The deobed version should print out:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int i = 1;
while (i &lt; 1000) {

  i ++;
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, I think I understood what you were trying to get at before. So does this essentially mean that if you can follow the program through with odd names and structures that you’ll be able to understood how it’s operating?</p>
<p>Could you explain to me why it’s so difficult to understand the structure of the programs? Wouldn’t every modification runescape makes be minimal over time and thus the general outline of their program be similar to what it once was? Then, is it difficult to compare the entire java client runescape has now obfuscated in new a new way to the one that was deobed with ZKM and used to run Aryan?</p>

        <p>Hey guys I went back to that topic and read up on the conversation. I have a question. Why dont we just modify the old Aryan enough so it works with the new engine and is just as detectable as the old 1 yet just as good. But we can also make the new Aryan for people who would like a less detectable Aryan. That way it would end all the arguments about this. It would sort out the people who try out the new one when it comes out and decide they like the old one better. And instead of them ranting about it, it would be right there for them to use. I never got a chnce to use Aryan so I would probably like to try out the original <span class="bbcode-i">and</span> the new one, and see which one I like better. Hopefully that will help make things clearer on what I was hoping for.</p>

<p>You’ve struck the idea that’s the basis of updaters. Unfortunately, most updaters in the past have operated by matching bits of code by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">regular expressions</a> created to find code in the deobfuscated and renamed “old engine” clients. The changes in the structure of the client, along with our current inability to properly deobfuscate and rename the client, have rendered these useless. There are several other updating methods that I’ve worked on, all of which work better than regex matching in the first place - not to mention that they still work on the new client - so it’s definitely possible for someone to create a bot updater still.</p>
<p>However, those with understanding of the RuneScape client should have no trouble picking out code for functions that they recognize - it’s just programs that have a lot more trouble now.</p>

<p>Yeah, you could, but in order to easily bypass the encryption (not really encryption, but a cryptographically secure random number generator called ISAAC) you’d have to log the packets from a hook inside the client - at which point, why not just look at the client that you obviously have access to already?</p>

There are several other updating methods that I’ve worked on, all of which work better than regex matching in the first place - not to mention that they still work on the new client - so it’s definitely possible for someone to create a bot updater still.</p>
<p>However, those with understanding of the RuneScape client should have no trouble picking out code for functions that they recognize - it’s just programs that have a lot more trouble now.[/quote]<br>
Oh I see… so right now, every update being done to any java bot needs direct human manipulation because working updaters have become difficult. Well I’m not even close to worrying about creating programs that edit/create other programs =oP</p>

<p>Yeah, you could, but in order to easily bypass the encryption (not really encryption, but a cryptographically secure random number generator called ISAAC) you’d have to log the packets from a hook inside the client - at which point, why not just look at the client that you obviously have access to already?</p>

</aside>
<p>Sensible enough… if I knew how to get a hold of the client so I could deob it. My apologies if it’s something basic that I should already know how to do  :o</p>

<p>Hmmm… is it really apathy or disinterest? ^_^; I’m guessing the more successful coders no longer find it a challenge to do repetitive work and are simply looking for more challenges.<br>

        <blockquote>Ok I think I understand what you're getting at. Is JVM an acronym for the process of the computer that executes commands?</blockquote>
The JVM is the Java Virtual Machine. It is the sandbox/environment that starts up, loads all the bootstrap API classes etc, loads your requested class, and starts running it, going through the bytecode.
<blockquote>First off, could you explain to me how do you go about saving the runescape client to your computer?</blockquote>
Navigate to any RuneScape server, and enter a random URL that matches the correct pattern, e.g
http://po4.runescape.com/runescape-omg-it-doesnt-matter-what-you-put-after-runescape.jar
http://ul2.runescape.com/runescape666.jar
<p>The result will be JAR’d up and you just need to extract it with jar -x or WinRAR or whatever.</p>
<blockquote>I can understand how those kinds of methods and procedures can be cumbersome but is it truly difficult to get past them? Wouldn't a program that deciphers the actual taks of the runescape client beable to determine what is being done or is that easier said then done?</blockquote>Well, I *think* the task is in identifying the useless code blocks, I'm not entirely sure.
For example, we could have:
[code]for(int i = 0; i &gt; anInt666; i++) {
  anInt666 *= someArray[i ^ anInt666];
}[/code]Now, for all we know, the starting condition on that foor loop may never be met in normal conditions, so the code doesn't execute. How do we identify that? And how do we identify that anInt666 is never used apart from here, hence making this block useless?
