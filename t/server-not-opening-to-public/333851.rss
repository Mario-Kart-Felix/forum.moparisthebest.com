    <description> :) Hey guys, I am in dire need of help.  :)

My problem is I can&#39;t open my server to the public. I have been using a status checker on another website to see if my server (when running) allows public access. It does not :(.
I have done everything from Port Forwarding to No-Ip. I quite possibly could have made a mistake. I am not sure what the problem is but I can tell you I did what the tutorials tells me.

I did these..
[b]
[ul][li]PFed my router (TCP - 43594 - and the IPv4 from my IPConfig[/li]
[li]Set up the No-Ip and put in my IPv4 from my IPConfig[/li][/ul]


I am open to using TeamViewer so you could be more hands on when trying to help.</description>
