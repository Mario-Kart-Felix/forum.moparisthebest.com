    <title>Starting a RSPS (Need developers!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-a-rsps-need-developers/541603</link>
    <description>Hi, let me start off by saying that my name on here is &quot;Mister Master&quot;, but I go by &quot;Masterlop&quot;

Are you tired of projects that don&#39;t last? Tired of owners giving up and wasting your time? Your team doesn&#39;t communicate well?

Well I&#39;m here to solve that... I&#39;ve been trying to help other people out, but most stop at the beginning of their project and I feel it just is a waste of my time.

So I&#39;m going to step up and try to recruit a team who actually wants to help out and will know that I won&#39;t give up on this project.

What I&#39;m looking for in a developer:

1. Coding skills - Are you good at coding RSPS?
2. Professionalism - Do you listen to players and have correct grammar?
3. Trust - Can I trust you to not give out items to players?
4. Communication - Can you communicate well with other developers?
5. Time - Do you have the time to invest in this project for the long run or do you plan to quit in a week?


Right now, I will be recruiting developers for my project, the base will be decided amongst us, and when we reach an agreement, will begin working on it.

I will also be buying a website, webhosting, and a vps in the future, once the ball gets rolling.

Any questions or if you&#39;d like to become a developer, please message me on skype - Garrett3650</description>
