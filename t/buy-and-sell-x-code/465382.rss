    <title>Buy and Sell x code</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buy-and-sell-x-code/465382</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m having troubles trying to find the line of code for buy x or sell x. I have a 317 rsps, project insanity. I was wondering if anyone could tell me the code for buy x or sell x. Buy all and sell all would be great (not needed). Thanks.</description>
