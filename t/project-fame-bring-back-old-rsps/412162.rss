Base: Delta

Hello all this is my first server and It might not be much but is it what I can do.
While the server is up I will be making updates but right now it&#39;s complete and I wish to release it.
This server will not have any new items such as d claws, vestas, chaotic.
I removed those because I want to bring back the days when rsps was about 3rd age, master wand,
and c bow.

What Spot do you want: Head Admin<br>
Experience: I have been many Head Administrators before and i understand what it takes to achieve a private server. I have helped many servers with problems including one which i helped get them out of being shutdown by Jagex. I am very capable of being staff and i am very mature and understand the rules that has been layed down for me. I do not abuse and commands or privileges that i gain.<br>
About you: I am humorous and serious at times. I can handle complicated situations and i am very mature. I am very advanced at english and i can talk properly[/quote]<br>

<p>Hello all this is my first server and It might not be much but is it what I can do.<br>
While the server is up I will be making updates but right now it’s complete and I wish to release it.<br>
This server will not have any new items such as d claws, vestas, chaotic.<br>
I removed those because I want to bring back the days when rsps was about 3rd age, master wand,<br>
and c bow.</p>
