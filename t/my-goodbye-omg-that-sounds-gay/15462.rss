    <title>My Goodbye (omg that sounds gay)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-goodbye-omg-that-sounds-gay/15462</link>
    <description>Finally i stopped some time with computing and RuneScape.
My life was a total waste, i was only on the computer, having no time for friends or girls.
Now i had to go back to school again, in a new class with new people.
I made 2 friends, and that&#39;s all.
There is also a girl i like, not really like i&#39;m in love or something, but i like her.
The funny thing is, i have always been really annoying at school, and noone really liked me.
Now i met the girl i just talked about and i am really nicer at school, and a lot more quiet too.
So i wont come online, on moparisthebest nor on rs-resources.
I have made many online friends, and i find talking online is really pleasant and nice, but i have to make real friends too.
Of course you might see me sometime, but it will be rare.
Maybe after a month i will come online every day again, mostly on rs-resources, but dont count on it.
Real life is much more beautifull then the online life, and i really enjoy &quot;lifing the real life&quot;.
Maybe it is because of the girl i met, or maybe because i am crazy, but it feels like i have a different person in my body.
It feels wonderfull, really, but stopping with getting online every time and not posting things is also hard, because i was a bit addicted to chatting with online friends.
And maybe you guys should do the same, or at least take a break sometimes.
Anyway, it&#39;s too bad i cannot see the birth of ARGA, and the day JaGeX will be totally owned by MacroSoft.
And of course i would miss the people from Moparisthebest and Rs-Resources, but i have to quit now.

Yes, i know i am acting like a girl, but it is true, real life feels better.
I might go on MSN some more now so i can chat with you guys and with my real life friends.
My msn is [b]pimjong@pimjong.pimjong[/b] , everyone may add me.

Very much greats,

Pim Jong, mostly known as Pimjong.
( My name is Pim Jong, but you can call me Pimjong :P )</description>

Just remember that real life and the world that you live in on your computer are one and the same; both are imaginary places you have created in your mind. The difference is that you can only see and hear what is on the computer, but in real life you can smell, taste, touch, see and hear everything. Your senses are brushes that paint a picture, nodes that join a model, but ultimately the whole of reality exists only in your mind.[/quote]<br>
So true. :’(<br>
Soon there will be vitual life with all the senses plus 8,000 more. That’s like sex for life.</p>

<p>Now hold up. Does this mean I’m part of Pimjong’s imagination, or yours? Or mine? Are you all part of my imagination? Knowing this, what would be to happen if I met you IRL?</p>

</aside>
<p>i disagree!!real life is not always better then online life.<br>
like for an example sometimes i have those shitty days at school that the only thing i want to do is lock the door and go online the whole day</p>
<p>and sometimes real life is sooo much better then being on computer that i once didnt go online for like a long time and only thing i did whole day was going outside with friends</p>
<p>here’s some advice : dont quit rs servers just spend less time being on your computer.whats the point of quiting runescape or computing??<br>
spend like 1-2 hours a day being on your computer <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>OR if you still plan to quit runescape and stuff just dont go on your computer for like a week and you’ll forget about computers and stuff really quickly(worked for me :P)</p>

Just remember that real life and the world that you live in on your computer are one and the same; both are imaginary places you have created in your mind. The difference is that you can only see and hear what is on the computer, but in real life you can smell, taste, touch, see and hear everything. Your senses are brushes that paint a picture, nodes that join a model, but ultimately the whole of reality exists only in your mind.</p>

              <p>Finally i stopped some time with computing and RuneScape.<br>
My life was a total waste, i was only on the computer, having no time for friends or girls.<br>
Now i had to go back to school again, in a new class with new people.<br>
I made 2 friends, and that’s all.<br>
There is also a girl i like, not really like i’m in love or something, but i like her.<br>
The funny thing is, i have always been really annoying at school, and noone really liked me.<br>
Now i met the girl i just talked about and i am really nicer at school, and a lot more quiet too.<br>
So i wont come online, on moparisthebest nor on rs-resources.<br>
I have made many online friends, and i find talking online is really pleasant and nice, but i have to make real friends too.<br>
Of course you might see me sometime, but it will be rare.<br>
Maybe after a month i will come online every day again, mostly on rs-resources, but dont count on it.<br>
Real life is much more beautifull then the online life, and i really enjoy “lifing the real life”.<br>
Maybe it is because of the girl i met, or maybe because i am crazy, but it feels like i have a different person in my body.<br>
It feels wonderfull, really, but stopping with getting online every time and not posting things is also hard, because i was a bit addicted to chatting with online friends.<br>
And maybe you guys should do the same, or at least take a break sometimes.<br>
Anyway, it’s too bad i cannot see the birth of ARGA, and the day JaGeX will be totally owned by MacroSoft.<br>
And of course i would miss the people from Moparisthebest and Rs-Resources, but i have to quit now.</p>
<p>Yes, i know i am acting like a girl, but it is true, real life feels better.<br>
I might go on MSN some more now so i can chat with you guys and with my real life friends.<br>
My msn is <span class="bbcode-b">pimjong@pimjong.pimjong</span> , everyone may add me.</p>
<p>Very much greats,</p>
<p>Pim Jong, mostly known as Pimjong.<br>
