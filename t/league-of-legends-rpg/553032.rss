    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/league-of-legends-rpg/553032</link>
    <description>Sup mopar. Wanted to show off a new project I started.

So first off a description of the game. The game is going to be an RPG (not mmo), where you play as your favorite champ from league of legends. You will actually be able to experience their lore instead of reading about it. There will be a levelling system and it will be pretty linear (not open world or anything). But I will add a lot of cool aspects into the game. By the way I will be using unreal engine 4.

Here&#39;s a few pics:

What do you guys think? Ideas? Tips? Champion Requests? (Because I don&#39;t really plan on animating and coding ALL of them)!</description>

<p>Yes I’ve read this from what I understand is that they do not want me to copy league code/functionality. As for models I did get the vertices from the client to morph my mesh, but Maya (An 3rd party software by autodesk), did all the work. Not sure if that counts as an exception.</p>

you get 5 lines of intro to a champ and some of them interact with one another in the game. that’s it. that’s lore in league of legends.</p>
<p>how am i ever supposed to know details about champs like how wild does jinx get when she puts her zap! in her pussy?</p>

<p>A lot of complaints have surfaced from players due to the lack of quality lore. I don’t pay much attention to lore, but the Bilgewater event that Riot just finished up with was created mainly due to this reason. The lore is not being phased out, it just became really sucky and now Riot is trying to overhaul it from what I’ve read.</p>

              <p>Yes they actually Hired a new writer a couple months back. The reason for it being so shotty now is that they are removing the League from the lore. So no more summoners and stuff like that. They are basically rewriting it. Which in my own opinion will definitely have continuity issues because in-game champs like nidalee, lux, udyr, all talk to the summoner. I don’t think there is an actual release date for the new lore though.</p>

              <p>well I started just a few days ago. I’m not sure if you missed the part where I said you play through the lore. Also I have to animate it myself (which takes time or else I break Anivia’s neck). If I don’t animate it, it would just be a block of mesh with a hitbox.<br>
So after I am done animating her the way I want and making sure particles match up with the mesh. Then I will start the level design. Which will be based off Frejlord (For Anivia’s story atleast). Fighting of the Corruption that is Sejuani and Lissandra. (I have very fun ideas for said… “Boss Battles”).</p>

<p>So first off a description of the game. The game is going to be an RPG (not mmo), where you play as your favorite champ from league of legends. You will actually be able to experience their lore instead of reading about it. There will be a levelling system and it will be pretty linear (not open world or anything). But I will add a lot of cool aspects into the game. By the way I will be using unreal engine 4.</p>
<p>Here’s a few pics:</p>

<p>What do you guys think? Ideas? Tips? Champion Requests? (Because I don’t really plan on animating and coding ALL of them)!</p>
