    <description>Hi :)

Text coloring:

When I go to a server, sometimes people will have the labels on things, such as &quot;Attack (Player name)&quot; turned to something like &quot;Murder&quot; or something. I&#39;ve tried finding where these labels are stored so I could edit them, but I&#39;ve had no luck. Please help?

Censoring:

I know there&#39;s a command that handles the commands that people give the server (::noclip, etc.), but I&#39;m looking for one that deals with just regular messages. I&#39;d like to have the power to censor what people type in. Much like the real RS :)

Items on the music player tab:

In a few servers I&#39;ve been on, people have had their music player tab be the home for an extra skill they add in. (Such as Summoning or Disguising.) Is there a way I can add this in mine? Where is that kind of stuff kept? I&#39;ve searched Server.java, but I was unable to find anything.

Server overload:

It seems that after just a little too much clicking on a server that I&#39;ve been on alone, (TestScape. Just me, on my computer.) causes the server to disconnect me. How can I give the server more room to work with, so that this doesn&#39;t happen if I ever make a public server?

One last thing,

The skill numbers are very confusing. How do I know what I&#39;m dealing with when I say something like playerLevel[-Number]?

Thank you, please try to help!

-Mike

EDIT:

Oh, one more thing.

How do I make it so when someone attacks something, they wait a certain amount of time in between attacks? As it is now, it hits over and over again without waiting.</description>

              <p>I guess I put Text coloring with a bad description. Or the other way around…</p>
<p>How would I make it change from “Attack” to “Own” or “Kill” or something?</p>
<p>So I can just download a server with something on the music player tab and take it from that?</p>

Items on the music player tab:<br>
Most servers come with this already<br>

this is called massing it causes server lagg if you don’t want this change all the disconnect = true;'s into false<br>
