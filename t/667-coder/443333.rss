    <description>This May/May Not be in the correct section, regardless idc.

As the title says i need a 667 Coder. I understand they are hard to come by, especially Good ones.

Requirements: 
Ability to Add/Edit Npc Hp//drops//Attack Formats.
Add//change//edit Skills, such as adding Slayer//Construction//Dung
Understanding the Server will Not be released Until it is near perfect, this means majority of Skills working//Npc&#39;s//Minigames (these can be added while server is running)
Adding NPC dialogue...
And more, that i will be testing you on...

What we are working with... I have a 667 already added a New home//20+shops, Donator Zone&amp;More but i am not a Experienced Coder and cannot do more than i would like... 

Benefits: Of course you will be Co-Owner/Coder, anywhere from 50-75% of the PayPal Donations will Be yours..

Vps//Hosting, I will not be Hosting through a Vps until i get enough money, But My Computer can hold Many Players and that will not be a problem. Also If you would prefer you Hosting that is fine with me.

Extra Information: Please contact me...</description>
