    <title>My story</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-story/248172</link>
    <description>Now, I know a lot of you have dubbed me as a faggot for what I did, when I removed frank_&#39;s moderation. I realize I did the wrong thing, and broke a lot of rules. All I ask for is that I be left alone after it, and that this whole situation just die. I just do not see eye-to-eye on a few things.

1) I could of sworn Silab was involved in posting an infected keylogger, and wasn&#39;t fully banned. Most people who do that instantly receive a full-time ban. She was granted a second/third chance, why can I not have the same privilege.
2) I&#39;d already resolved this with Lothy, and we ended up beginning a new server base for the 508 client, just as it never happened. However, he made sure I understood that I had to tow the line from now on, fine with me. I did the wrong thing, and understand I deserve to be punishment.
3) Despite the amount of moderation I did on MoparScape, I had never done it before (other than using my warning powers in the programming section once, but that was under the grant of Niall).

Overall, yes me being demoted was justified. I would of done the same thing, but I do believe I am owed a second chance. If not, fine with me. I do know that life is sometime not fair, and I will have to accept it and move on. It probably didn&#39;t help that Moparisthebest looked down at me as a moderator from day one, and always thought of myself as an elitist.</description>

Your position as a moderator however has been revoked.</p>
<p>My understanding is that you are more than welcome to hang around as a non-staff member simply because you had the decency not to screw any of us around by making us find out who was responsible the hard way.[/quote]<br>
If I didn’t confess apparently it was impossible to find out, according to someone who I actually cannot remember at this time.</p>

              <p>I didn’t go as far as stripping your powers because it had to be put to discussion. It was agreed upon that you should retain your ability to access the site along with all you had achieved as a regular member (ie, your Community Member status and your remaining non-moderator awards). Your position as a moderator however has been revoked.</p>
<p>My understanding is that you are more than welcome to hang around as a non-staff member simply because you had the decency not to screw any of us around by making us find out who was responsible the hard way.</p>

              <p>Now, I know a lot of you have dubbed me as a faggot for what I did, when I removed frank_'s moderation. I realize I did the wrong thing, and broke a lot of rules. All I ask for is that I be left alone after it, and that this whole situation just die. I just do not see eye-to-eye on a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>I could of sworn Silab was involved in posting an infected keylogger, and wasn’t fully banned. Most people who do that instantly receive a full-time ban. She was granted a second/third chance, why can I not have the same privilege.</li>
<li>I’d already resolved this with Lothy, and we ended up beginning a new server base for the 508 client, just as it never happened. However, he made sure I understood that I had to tow the line from now on, fine with me. I did the wrong thing, and understand I deserve to be punishment.</li>
<li>Despite the amount of moderation I did on MoparScape, I had never done it before (other than using my warning powers in the programming section once, but that was under the grant of Niall).</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, yes me being demoted was justified. I would of done the same thing, but I do believe I am owed a second chance. If not, fine with me. I do know that life is sometime not fair, and I will have to accept it and move on. It probably didn’t help that Moparisthebest looked down at me as a moderator from day one, and always thought of myself as an elitist.</p>
