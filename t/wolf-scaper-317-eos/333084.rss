Okay, now, for those who want to be part of this experience and are thinking, there&#39;s probably noobs on this team, your wrong already ^^.


Here&#39;s Some Information About Us:

The idea development team starts making a base for whatever they have an idea for, lets say Wolf-Wars...


When we started out with wolf-wars, we had a few ideas, something like runescape&#39;s soul wars and something better.  So how we made this better was we added obstacles, like ranged towers, mage towers and even &quot;No-Mans-Land&quot;

The ranged towers require you to be using ranged equipment, you can only range from these towers, same goes with mage towers except you use magic.

The No-mans land is a narrow strip that is surrounded by enemy mage and range towers, not to mention that if you die in this strip area, you lose your stuff until the end of the game(or until you log out)

If that isn&#39;t enough intensity for you, try having some beast ass monsters pounding you down with ranged and mage!  Yeah, and if that still isn&#39;t enough for you, you have these obstacles that will randomly kill you...gf...

And, if that still isn&#39;t good enough, maybe getting the mass barrage every round will

After 1 minute of the game, if your in wolf wars, you get barraged.  This happens every minute, everyone gets barraged.



So, that&#39;s what our development team came up with, so, do you wanna join this fucking awesome team?
