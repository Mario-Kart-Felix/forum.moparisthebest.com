    <title>639 idle packet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/639-idle-packet/485838</link>
    <description>Does anyone know what packet the 639 sends with the amount of time idle so I can set it to log out my players after a certain amount of time? I&#39;ve searched everywhere and I couldn&#39;t find it. It logs out after like 10 seconds in the lobby, but not actually in game.</description>
