    <title>Help thinking of a title for my story</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-thinking-of-a-title-for-my-story/72117</link>
    <description>This is my story so far:

I listen to the antagonising whine for a few seconds before slapping at my neck for what seems to be the millionth time today. The mosquito buzzes away unharmed. It has been a rough week, the wet jungle of Kokoka seems to close on me more and more every hour, hour after hour with no action to break the silence. No gunshots, no contact and not even any talking other than Martin and James’s occasional bickering. The six of us trudge through the mud towards the Japanese camp, which is almost undefended according to intelligence. 

“Hey Sarge, maybe we should call it a day and set up camp. Martin looks tired.”
“Cram it James, I’m fine.”
“Hey I’m just lookin’ out for you, you’re doing that funny stagger again.”
“Look, I said-“
“Save it for the Japs boys, we should get our action tomorrow morning.” Sarge interrupts.
“We are only about an hour away from the camp, drop your bags, we’re sleeping here tonight. Tomorrow we meet up with Charlie. I want you rested, and ready to kill any Japanese son of a bitch, stupid enough to get between us, and that squad leader.”
“Hoo-Rah!” We chant.

I gratefully drop my heavy pack and pull out my canteen and sleeping bag. After a long drink I hit the sack, collapsing on the ground from exhaustion.


Next they will be ambushed, the story teller gets shot, I do the battle scene around him and he dies. Can anybody think of a name for my story? I will post the rest of it when I finish it today/tomorrow if anybody wants to read it.</description>
