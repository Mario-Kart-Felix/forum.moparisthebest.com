    <title>Gun training for Australian kids</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gun-training-for-australian-kids/105093</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s the link: http://www.news.com.au/sundaytelegraph/story/0,22049,21840789-5005941,00.html

&lt;blockquote&gt;CHILDREN should start firearms training from age 10 and shooting programs should be reinstated at schools, says the NSW gun lobby.

At present children as young as 12 can gain a gun permit, allowing them to shoot semi-automatic pistols, bolt-action rifles and other firearms under supervision.

NSW Shooters Party MP Roy Smith told the Sunday Telegraph his group would lobby parliament to allow 10-year-olds to gain two years&#39; experience with air rifles before they sat for gun licences.

&quot;Kids these days get in trouble because we don&#39;t trust them with anything,&quot; Mr Smith said.

&quot;BB guns and air rifles now have to be registered when, in my day, all the boys were running around with them; we don&#39;t trust kids with pocket knives and we don&#39;t trust them with (fire) crackers.

&quot;So essentially the first taste of responsibility kids get in Australia nowadays is when we hand them the keys to the car - often with tragic consequences.&quot;

Mr Smith said his party would also lobby for gun safety programs and shooting lessons to be reintroduced into school curriculums.

In contrast, the Coalition for Gun Control last week urged the State Government to abolish gun permits for minors.

Spokeswoman Sam Lee said the law was &quot;absurd&quot;.

&quot;It is dangerously ironic that a young person cannot possess a fake or replica handgun but that they can legally use a real one,&quot; she said.

&quot;We don&#39;t let them get a driver&#39;s licence until they are 17, because it&#39;s too dangerous, but we let them shoot with a semi-automatic handgun before they are even teenagers.&quot;

Sporting Shooters Association of Australia statistics show big increases across all ages - including minors - in its membership.

Spokesman Adam Leto said in 2000, there were just 15 members under the age of 18.

Last year that figure had jumped to about 400, with an average of 120 new members signing up every three months.

&quot;We now have about 1000 members under the age of 18,&quot; he said.

Western Sydney schoolboy Matthew Woolnough, 12, earned his gun licence two months ago and goes to target practice with his brother Aaron, 14, at an SSAA indoor range.

&quot;I enjoy it,&quot; he said. &quot;It gives you confidence although the other kids say, &#39;you can&#39;t play soccer so you have to shoot guns instead&#39;.

&quot;I have a disease which makes my cartilage disintegrate so I can&#39;t (run around on the field).&quot;

Ashleigh Bell, 17, took up shooting initially because of her dream of becoming a policewoman.

&quot;You feel really strong and confident when you know how to use a gun and the other kids think it&#39;s pretty cool,&quot; she said.

&quot;It&#39;s relaxing, it improves your concentration and when you&#39;re feeling angry you can come here and shoot instead of taking it out on a person.&quot;

Her sister Rebecca, 12, currently has her temporary membership exemption - a precursor to a minor&#39;s permit, which she is due to receive next month.

&quot;I wanted to do it because I saw my sister liked it so much,&quot; she said.

&quot;I&#39;ve been told I&#39;ve got a pretty good eye so I&#39;m pretty happy with that.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree with this idea completely. 
Firstly it&#39;s not as unsafe as they (the gun control crowd) make out. It&#39;s in a controlled environment.
Secondly, Australians should have guns for safety reasons. If I was living in Sydney, I&#39;d like to feel safe at night (we all know what the lebs get up to in their gangs of 50).

There are more benefits for guns in general though: If someone broke into your house, could you depend on the police to protect you? For one, police take too long, even in emergencies. And two, police seem intimidated by people like lebs. Oh it&#39;s great seeing police (the so called protectors of society) on TV being intimidated by minority groups. Really reassuring.
Fancy security systems don&#39;t do much better either - it could take over half an hour for security people to arrive (presuming you&#39;ve got one of those very expensive security systems installed).

But that&#39;s not all. Guns were removed after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, after completely defenseless people were shot down like animals. The question is this: If someone had a gun and shot Bryant down, would there have been so many deaths? I doubt it.

While we&#39;re on the topic of saving lives though: 
Let&#39;s ban petrol and cars, because cars can kill people and petrol is flammable (could be used in petrol bombs). No problem there, we can all spend days walking. 
Let&#39;s ban sparklers because they&#39;re hot afterwards and could be used to burn someone&#39;s eyes out. 
Let&#39;s ban glass bottles because they can be shattered and then become sharp.
Let&#39;s ban keyboards and mice with cables, because we all know how risky they are - someone could choke someone to death.
Let&#39;s ban cutlery that isn&#39;t plastic, because there&#39;s a chance someone could stab someone with a metal butter knife.
You know what, let&#39;s wrap everyone up in cotton wool and have them stay inside their houses, just in case someone tries to suffocate them with plastic bags from the local shopping center.

What&#39;s your view on Australia and it&#39;s stance towards guns?</description>

<p>I’m aganist Gun Control. You can’t put a limit on this. I however, Think that it’s a great idea and may send the wrong message but only if they teach gun control the wrong way. It has it’s pros and cons but I dont live in sydney so I don’t understand the circumstances so I’m not to judge. My father owns 3-4 guns and I’m a great shot with a rifle or any gun. I would like to protect myself with a gun if someone breaks into my house but then again I’m American and my third amendment says I can bear arms if neccessary.<br>

Don’t you mean the 2nd Amendment? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Anyway, yeah. If someone broke in here we’d have to call the police. 10 minutes later when the police do arrive it’s too late - the criminals are long gone. What good is calling the cops when the criminals aren’t going to be there when they arrive?[/quote]<br>
Cops come fast here. All i know is we have a 3-step rule here for shooting. It’s hard to explain. Anyways, if the criminal has left your property then you can’t shoot them in America because you would get jail time for a shit law. So if you shoot someone drag them back into your house. Xd.</p>

I’m aganist Gun Control. You can’t put a limit on this. I however, Think that it’s a great idea and may send the wrong message but only if they teach gun control the wrong way. It has it’s pros and cons but I dont live in sydney so I don’t understand the circumstances so I’m not to judge. My father owns 3-4 guns and I’m a great shot with a rifle or any gun. I would like to protect myself with a gun if someone breaks into my house but then again I’m American and my third amendment says I can bear arms if neccessary.[/quote]<br>
Don’t you mean the 2nd Amendment? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Anyway, yeah. If someone broke in here we’d have to call the police. 10 minutes later when the police do arrive it’s too late - the criminals are long gone. What good is calling the cops when the criminals aren’t going to be there when they arrive?</p>

              <p>Dude this conversation is getting to in depth for me so im just gunna throw in my $.02 and run, i do believe every one should be trained on guns, at an earlier age also, then there would be less accidental deaths from uneducated children playing with guns and killing a friend or family member. I do not think that they should be able to own one until 18 though, maybe they could get the license at like 12-13, but only like a temps type one, only good for highly supervised use at an approved shooting range… Although i am mostly for this idea, it does seem very odd, the idea of a school having a shooting range/class. So thats all i have to say, any one else see it like me?</p>

              <p>[quote=“leader, post:9, topic:105093”]First let me say I disagree with this. It is a good idea, but should be used for a different purpose. I believe that children who are interested in joining the military or parents who want their children to join the military should only be allowed to participate in this shooting program.</p>
<p>Guns are dangerous, and like it was said before, their sole purpose is to kill. If more children start using guns, there will be more crimes. For with power, comes greed. The children would feel like they are stronger than others since they know how to use guns. Once they think that way, then the crimes will start happening. Also, the children would not be mature, so they would be under the influence of others.</p>
<p>As I said before, only children who are interested in the military should participate in this program. The children would have knowledge about guns and survival. This would be essential for them when they join the military. They will have hands-down experience with guns, and would be able to train better than the other recruits.</p>
<p>Instead of promoting gun use, we should advise against it. I would agree if this was for people over the age of 16. It would be OK because the user would be mature and know the effect of using a gun. Young children just want to play around and really do not pay attention to much. Most young children are easily persuaded into doing things. If a young child saw their friends using guns, wouldn’t they want to use them too?[/quote]<br>
Only problem so far is that everyone has failed to point out any mention of the kids actually carrying the guns they use. It’s <em>just</em> teaching them how to use a gun, and then giving them a gun license after 2 years <em>if</em> they sit the test.<br>
In other words, they can then get a gun at 12.</p>
<p>The main aim of it is to ensure that people do know how to use firearms. It’s not even saying they have to get their license at 12 etc. Just that they should be learning how to use them in a safe environment.</p>
<p>As for discouraging guns: maybe it’s the right thing to do. But it is completely unrealistic to believe that violence will one day just disappear.</p>

Gun training is in a controlled environment. Your suggestion is very unlikely because of that.[/quote]</p>
<p>Then they walk out the training area and enter a uncontrolled enviroment(the ‘real world’) and proceed to shoot both of their parents in the face because they would not buy him/her a toy.</p>
<p>Why on earth do they feel the need to teach it in schools? This generation(the ‘playstation generation’) is already rather unmotivated as it is, why not teach them something that will actually be useful in their life and not cause a increase in parent homicides.</p>

<p>WRONG</p>
<p>this is stupid simply for the fact that a 10-12 year old child has not had enough life experiences to fully make the right choices in most situations, not to mention it’s giving kids the wrong message. the right message should be “guns aren’t needed” but instead it’s “here, make guns a part of your everyday life”</p>
<p>obviously these australian dipshits haven’t read kurt vonnegut’s <span class="bbcode-i">cat’s cradle</span>[/quote]<br>
Read the article. They are under constant supervision. They don’t own a gun right away - they <em>eventually</em> get a license that lets them fire at a shooting range. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. 10 year olds can be prosecuted in Australia if it can be proven that they understand what they were doing. 14+ year olds can be prosecuted in any case. If it’s good enough for them to be prosecuted, then the government obviously thinks that they’ve had enough life experience and enough understanding.<br>
It’s no more dangerous then Yz racing motorbikes, or kids in go-karts.</p>

              <p>I think its a good idea, although there would be a lot of safety issued sorted out. If the guns are only allowed to be held or used in a controlled place - perhaps under the supervision of someone over 18 with a gun license.</p>

Gun training is in a controlled environment. Your suggestion is very unlikely because of that.</p>
