    <title>How to backflip on a trampoline - First of many tutorials</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-backflip-on-a-trampoline-first-of-many-tutorials/296511</link>
    <description>I decided I&#39;ll do a series of trampoline tutorials, because i&#39;m getting bored of browsing mscp all day :(

-- How to backflip --

The truth: Backflips are very easy, it&#39;s just the mental part that&#39;s hard. I&#39;d say that 1/4 of the flip is physical, while 3/4 is mental. Frontflips are actually HARDER than backflips, but most people try frontflips first because it&#39;s not as scary as doing a backflip. 

Step 1:
Practice by going really low and just flipping straight up and back. This gets you some momentum. Make sure you aren&#39;t bouncing high. If you get scared while doing this or it just really isn&#39;t working out then do some backrolls. (like somersaults but instead you go backwards) This gets you the feel of going inverted backwards.

Step 2:
Let&#39;s do a quick check:
You now know how to do a backroll or going really low, &quot;squatting&quot; and doing a small flip barely off the base of the trampoline.
Now, start going a little higher and flipping. If you feel un-comfortable while doing this, then try jumping to the side, while going backwards.
What I mean with going to the side while going backwards, is that don&#39;t flip straight back, turn a little sideways when you flip. So if inverted is 180 degrees, then go to 140 degrees. You get my point.

Step 3:
Now theres no &quot;if you feel un-comfortable&quot; words. This is the point where you actually do the backflip and land it. (You probably won&#39;t land it     on your first try)
Try doing the backflip higher and higher. You might start flipping slower, this is normal. Keep practicing and eventually you will know how to flip to the point of landing on your knees.

Step 4:
Let&#39;s do another check:
You know how to flip, but you are landing on your knees. (Or maybe you&#39;re landing them on your feet now!)
The only solution I know to this is try to spot the landing when you&#39;re flipping and kick your feet out in any direction you need to. Try to get them to hit the trampoline first, and then fall on your ass. Eventually you&#39;ll land it.

This does include how to get over the fear of breaking your neck, step 1 and step 2.

Post any problems/questions you have.</description>
