    <description>[font=Century Gothic]Hey,

Well my NPC&#39;s have a couple major attacking glitches that I hope you all can help me with! 

[b]Question 1:[/b]
The first is that when you attack an NPC he will just stand there and face your direction (Image A), and will not follow you to attack you back. I want to know if theres a way to make him follow you and attack you back, but without noclipping, or I don&#39;t want him to follow the player all the way back to Varrock or something. (P.S. I have set walking coords so he is allowed to walk around.)

[b]Question 2:[/b]The second is that an NPC will not give up. For example I attacked the NPC and died (I was teleported to respawn area). The NPC still faced me even though I was atleast 1,000 cords away. When I came back he was still facing me, and my friend (Image A) was attacking him. He wouldn&#39;t give-up on me, therefore my friend a lvl 30 killed a lvl 86, because the Fire Giant never attacked him back, because he wouldn&#39;t &quot;give-up&quot; on me. How do I make the Giant &quot;Give-Up&quot;, and attack someone else if he is attacked by that person?
