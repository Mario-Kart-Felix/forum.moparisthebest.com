    <title>How to edit sprites in a 508?~?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-edit-sprites-in-a-508/360800</link>
    <description>Okay so I have relized that the only way to edit the sprites is that you override them in the chache. To do this you have to make a new &quot;sprites folder&quot; and have a DAT file and a IDX file in there with those you must edit to the picture you want but I have no idea how. Any one know of a program out there that might be able to do this? Or if you know how to do it your self. Thanks</description>

              <p>There is a tutorial on 508 custom sprites scattered somewhere around this economy, i think it’s made by laz.to edit it you need a sprite unpacker/editor or you can just make your own sprites with a sprite maker that can be found in this tutorial here… <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=354214.0" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=354214.0</a></p>
