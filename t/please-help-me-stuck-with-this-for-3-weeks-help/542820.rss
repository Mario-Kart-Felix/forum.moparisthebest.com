<p>Could you give me a link of the client you made into a .jar? The client in a folder. It sounds to me like a auto cache download problem and I can fix that.[/quote]<br>
You wouldn’t even need his client. You’d need the cache.<br>
Make sure the other kid using the client has his java permissions set to medium.</p>
