    <description>Hey guys, I have a problem with my fishing class/enum. Every time I try to call the 2nd value (technically 1st since starting at 0), it just returns the value &quot;0&quot;. I have been through many tests and have concluded the following:

[CODE]SHRIMP_AND_ANCHOVIES(317, 321, 303, 621, 1 , 10, 1, 5, true),//Small net[/CODE]
The first value (0), or &quot;317&quot;, will be the only one to be called out of the two numbers: &quot;317&quot; and &quot;321&quot;. This is the problem, let me explain further.

[CODE]int whichFish =  (c.playerLevel[c.playerFishing]/5 &lt; getFormula(c))? fishData.getNpcId() : fishData.getSecondNpcId(); // Npc Id[/CODE]
This is basically saying [B]if fishing level is less than formula, whichfish is equal to getNpcId, else , whichfish is equal to getSecondNpcId[/B]
[CODE][B]private static int getFormula(Client c)
	{
		 c.sendMessage(&quot;Formula: &quot; + (int) (Math.round(c.playerLevel[c.playerFishing] / 1 )));
		 return (int) (Math.round(c.playerLevel[c.playerFishing] / 1));
	}[/B][/CODE]
This is the formula for whichfish (I know, it&#39;s a very bad formula. It was only for tests purposes. I need to re-do it when I figure this out.) 
Anyways, if [B](c.playerLevel[c.playerFishing]/5 &lt; getFormula(c))[/B]  was true, it would spit out &quot;317&quot; (shrimp), if false, it is supposed to spit out &quot;321&quot; (anchovies), but instead, it just spits out &quot;0&quot;.

After further tests, I have figured out the following:

[CODE]TUNA_AND_SWORDFISH(359, 371, 311, 618, 35, 80, 50, 100, true),
CASKET_AND_SEAWEED(405, 401, 305, 620, 75, 50, true),
SHRIMP_AND_ANCHOVIES(321, 321, 303, 621, 1 , 10, 1, 5, true)[/CODE]

When there are two types of fish or objects to be caught, only the first value will be called.
This is because [CODE]case 319:
			case 329:
			case 323:
			case 325:
			case 326:
			case 327:
			case 330:
			case 332:
			case 316: // NET + BAIT
			Fishing.fish(c, 317);
				break;[/CODE]whatever the &quot;npcId&quot;, or 317 in this case, (which is a parameter for my fishing method) whatever the value is, the first value, or &quot;0&quot;, of the enum constant must match or else the fishing method won&#39;t work and it will give an error in the console. 

I have tried almost everything I can think of. I have no clue what to do at this point. If you guys can help, that would be great, thanks in advance!

Also, I know I didn&#39;t do the best at explaining this, so if you need extra information, just ask.</description>
