    <title>Need help with 614 command problem, A.S.A.P</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-614-command-problem-a-s-a-p/452868</link>
    <description>Hi there,
This is my first post on MOPAR, mainly because everything I&#39;ve needed has been accessible here already.
I&#39;m in the process of coding a 614 server.
I had all commands working as intended, but when I edited player rights for two other profiles, I received this error in game when typing in any other commands in game.

error reads:

&quot;Use the reverse apostrophe key to open the console to enter that command. It is usually located under the ESC key.&quot;

I try typing the command in the developers console and nothing happens.
I&#39;ve done a search for files containing the text and nothing seems to appear.

Please offer any help/suggestions if possible!</description>

              <p>In the developers console did you type like ::item in it?  Because you are meant to just type for example item 995 100.</p>
