    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/website-help-written-tutorial/470793</link>
    <description>Hello, welcome to my first tutorial on moparscape.
To help you with making a website.
[Read Below]

[Code]
[General Website Layout][Start]
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C/DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;
&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitionsal..dtd&quot;&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;


&lt;body&gt;


&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
[General Website Layout][End]

[If you use the template, skip step 1-4]
Starting with HTML:
[NEED TO START WITH THIS] Need to start with &quot;&lt;!doctype html&gt;&quot; or you can use &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C/DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;
&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitionsal..dtd&quot;&gt;
Then use &quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot; to start website and &quot;&lt;/html&gt; to end website
Use &quot;&lt;head&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;/head&gt;&quot;
&quot;&lt;title&gt;&quot; To start a title, and &quot;&lt;/title&gt;&quot; to end
&quot;&lt;hr /&gt;&quot; for a long line across the screen
&quot;&lt;body&gt;&quot; to start the main things, such as text. And &quot;&lt;/body&gt;&quot; to end
&quot;&lt;!--&quot; To see things on document but not website &quot;--&gt;&quot;
&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; To start a paragraph and &quot;&lt;/p&gt; to end it
&quot;&lt;strong&gt;&quot; to start bold text and &quot;&lt;/strong&gt; to end it
&quot;&lt;em&gt;&quot; to start italic text and &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; to end it
&quot;&lt;a&gt;&quot; to start a link and &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to end it [NOT FINISHED!] [Read Below]
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;Link&quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to end it [Must use full link! &quot;http://websitename.com&quot;]
To make a new page for your website, copy the content on the current slide and make a new document and paste it. [Not finished! Read Below!]
After that, save as: second page or whatever and save it as a &quot;html&quot;
If you want a link from your 1st page to your second then type &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;Page Name&quot;&gt;What you want it to say&lt;/a&gt;&quot;
To add a link to the same webpage you will have to go to the place you want to link and add &quot;&lt;a name=&quot;link you will use&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;
After that goto the top of the page and do &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;#name&quot;&gt;Text you want to use&lt;/a&gt;&quot; [You can do this as many times as you like]
To add a link to an email adress you will have to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:email&quot;&gt;Text you want it to say&lt;/a&gt;&quot;
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;Website&quot; title=&quot;Text&quot;&gt;Text that will show on your webpage&lt;/a&gt;&quot; [This will be what it will say when you hover over a link]
To add an image you will have to: Find an image, find out what the image name is and copy it into your website folder. [Not finished! Keep going!]
Then type: &quot;&lt;img src=&quot;File Name.jpg/etc&quot;/&gt;&quot;
To turn it into a link you will have to add the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;Where you want to link it to&quot;&gt;&quot; at the start and &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; at the end
To resize an image just simply put it on the website, &quot;&lt;img src=&quot;Picture Name.Whatever&quot; height=&quot;Size you want&quot;/&gt;&quot; [Not the smaller the images, the faster the website. Easier if you make the images smaller using photoshop, etc.]
To make a table you will have to start with &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; and end with &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot;
Everything inbetween this will be your table, to make more rows. Use &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot; and to make a collum, use &quot;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&quot; [No Data = No table]
The more rows, the more &quot;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&quot; you will need.
To add a border use &quot;&lt;table border=&quot;Size of border you want&quot;&gt;&quot;
For table headers, use &quot;&lt;th&gt;Text&lt;/th&gt;&quot; [This needs to be in the table rows!]
To change how many collums the header takes up, you will need to type &quot;&lt;th colspan=&quot;How many rows you want it to take up&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/th&gt;&quot; [Needs a &lt;tr&gt; {Table Row) for itself!]
And changing the table width, you will need to type &quot;&lt;table border=&quot;If you want&quot; width=&quot;How ever many pixels&quot;&gt;&quot; or you can give it a percentage. So you can have &quot;&lt;table border=&quot;If you want it&quot; width=100%&quot;&gt;&quot; [Either way is good]
You can change the space between the text and border by putting, &quot;&lt;table border=&quot;If needed&quot; cellpadding=&quot;Distance you want between text and border&quot; [Not needed, just for making it look better]
You can also change the cells themselfs, &quot;&lt;table border=&quot;If you want it&quot; cellspacing=&quot;Distance between cells&quot; [Not needed, I would not recomend]
To add lists, you will need to type: &quot;&lt;ul&gt;&quot; to start and &quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&quot; to end
To add something to your list you will need to type: &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; to start and &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; to end[Un-Orderd List]
To make an orderd list you will need to type &quot;&lt;ol&gt;&quot; to start and &quot;&lt;/ol&gt;&quot; to end
Same rules accure with &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; to start the list of items and &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot; to end

Starting with CSS:
&quot;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&quot; to start the website look sexy! &quot;&lt;/style&gt;&quot; to end it
Between the two brackets you will now need to add &quot;p {colour:blue;}&quot; you can also add &quot;p {colour:blue};font-family:arial}&quot;
To make it look better you can seperate the rules, do this by doing &quot;p {colour:blue;
                                                                           font-family:arial;
																		   }
RGB Colours are found on Photoshop colour picker or on websites. If you use RGB, you will need to do &quot;h1/p/whatever {colour:#RGB Number;}
To change the width of your paragraphs, you will need to type: &quot;p {line-height:Percentage%;}&quot; [This will be inbetween &quot;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;/style&gt;&quot; [125-130% is good]
Best way to make text bold is by doing it through CSS &quot;p/ul/ol or whatever {front-weight:bold;} [This is between &quot;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;/style&gt;&quot;]
Best way to change the font to italic is through CSS &quot;p/ul/ol or whatever {font-style:italic;) [Also between &quot;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;/style&gt;&quot;]
To change where the title is placed you will have to type: &quot;h3/h4/h5 or whatever {text-align:center;} [You can also use &quot;
To indent a paragraph you will have to use &quot;p {text-indent:&quot;Number of Pixels/Percentage&quot;}
To change the overall Font/Font Colour/Background Image or Background Colour, you will need to &quot;Body {
																					background-colour:colour you want; [Background Colour]
																					colour:colour you want; [Font Colour]
																					font:font you want [Font]
																					background-image:url(FileName); [Background Image]
																					background-repeat:no-repeat; [To have one big Background Image]
																					background-repeat:repeat-x; [Repeat Longways]
																					background-repeat:repeat-y; [Repeat Up and Down]
																					background-position: &quot;Size from Left hand size&quot; &quot;How far down&quot; [Image in a certain position]
																					background-position: 50% 50% [To center the picture]
																					}
To change the padding, you will need to type inbetween &quot;style,&quot; &quot;h1/h2/h3/h4 or whatever     h1/h2/h3 or whatever {background-colour:colour;
																													  padding:Number of Pixels; [All Directions]
																													  padding-top:Number of Pixels; [Top]
																													  padding-bottom:Number of Pixels; [Bottom]
																								                      padding-left:Number of Pixels; [Left]
																								                      padding-right:Number of Pixels; [Right]
																								                      {
To change the border using CSS, you will need to type this inbetween &quot;&lt;style&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;/style&gt;&quot;    border-colour:colour; [Colour]
																									border-width:Number of Pixels; [Width]
																									border-style:dashed [Border Pattern][there are a lot more borders, search for them online!]
																									{
To change the margin of everything on your webpage! You will need a background colour and you will need to type: margin:Number of Pixels; }
[/Code]

It kind of made me vomit a little. I didn’t bother reading all the way through because I know more then the basics, and well, it’s design was bad. Use [code ] tags when you demonstrate code. And get rid of the [] in front of every new line…<br>

There, hopefully that is better.[/quote]<br>
No offence but no.<br>
You put the whole tutorial in code tags.<br>
I said only throw the code in it.<br>
You don’t need to declare  if you have a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declared…<br>
I’m sure there’s more problems, I hadn’t read it all yet.<br>
Get rid of all that tabbing and stuff. It’s a tutorial. You’re conventions don’t matter when describing what each tag/code does.</p>

              <p>This is terribly laid out, I love it when people write tutorials but at least make it look neat. You also skip past quite a lot of detail in certain aspects such as selectors in CSS and just general tardiness in code. Try working on the layout a bit and then I’ll point out where you could have went better with the code <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Hello, welcome to my first tutorial on moparscape.<br>
To help you with making a website.<br>
[Read Below]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[General Website Layout][Start]
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C/DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitionsal..dtd"&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;


&lt;body&gt;


&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
[General Website Layout][End]

[If you use the template, skip step 1-4]
Starting with HTML:
[NEED TO START WITH THIS] Need to start with "&lt;!doctype html&gt;" or you can use &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C/DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitionsal..dtd"&gt;
Then use "&lt;html&gt;" to start website and "&lt;/html&gt; to end website
Use "&lt;head&gt;" and "&lt;/head&gt;"
"&lt;title&gt;" To start a title, and "&lt;/title&gt;" to end
"&lt;hr /&gt;" for a long line across the screen
"&lt;body&gt;" to start the main things, such as text. And "&lt;/body&gt;" to end
"&lt;!--" To see things on document but not website "--&gt;"
"&lt;p&gt;" To start a paragraph and "&lt;/p&gt; to end it
"&lt;strong&gt;" to start bold text and "&lt;/strong&gt; to end it
"&lt;em&gt;" to start italic text and "&lt;/em&gt;" to end it
"&lt;a&gt;" to start a link and "&lt;/a&gt;" to end it [NOT FINISHED!] [Read Below]
"&lt;a href="Link"&gt;" and "&lt;/a&gt;" to end it [Must use full link! "http://websitename.com"]
To make a new page for your website, copy the content on the current slide and make a new document and paste it. [Not finished! Read Below!]
After that, save as: second page or whatever and save it as a "html"
If you want a link from your 1st page to your second then type "&lt;a href="Page Name"&gt;What you want it to say&lt;/a&gt;"
To add a link to the same webpage you will have to go to the place you want to link and add "&lt;a name="link you will use"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"
After that goto the top of the page and do "&lt;a href="#name"&gt;Text you want to use&lt;/a&gt;" [You can do this as many times as you like]
To add a link to an email adress you will have to "&lt;a href="mailto:email"&gt;Text you want it to say&lt;/a&gt;"
"&lt;a href="Website" title="Text"&gt;Text that will show on your webpage&lt;/a&gt;" [This will be what it will say when you hover over a link]
To add an image you will have to: Find an image, find out what the image name is and copy it into your website folder. [Not finished! Keep going!]
Then type: "&lt;img src="File Name.jpg/etc"/&gt;"
To turn it into a link you will have to add the "&lt;a href="Where you want to link it to"&gt;" at the start and "&lt;/a&gt;" at the end
To resize an image just simply put it on the website, "&lt;img src="Picture Name.Whatever" height="Size you want"/&gt;" [Not the smaller the images, the faster the website. Easier if you make the images smaller using photoshop, etc.]
To make a table you will have to start with "&lt;table&gt;" and end with "&lt;/table&gt;"
Everything inbetween this will be your table, to make more rows. Use "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;" and to make a collum, use "&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;" [No Data = No table]
The more rows, the more "&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;" you will need.
To add a border use "&lt;table border="Size of border you want"&gt;"
For table headers, use "&lt;th&gt;Text&lt;/th&gt;" [This needs to be in the table rows!]
To change how many collums the header takes up, you will need to type "&lt;th colspan="How many rows you want it to take up"&gt;Text&lt;/th&gt;" [Needs a &lt;tr&gt; {Table Row) for itself!]
And changing the table width, you will need to type "&lt;table border="If you want" width="How ever many pixels"&gt;" or you can give it a percentage. So you can have "&lt;table border="If you want it" width=100%"&gt;" [Either way is good]
You can change the space between the text and border by putting, "&lt;table border="If needed" cellpadding="Distance you want between text and border" [Not needed, just for making it look better]
You can also change the cells themselfs, "&lt;table border="If you want it" cellspacing="Distance between cells" [Not needed, I would not recomend]
To add lists, you will need to type: "&lt;ul&gt;" to start and "&lt;/ul&gt;" to end
To add something to your list you will need to type: "&lt;li&gt;" to start and "&lt;li&gt;" to end[Un-Orderd List]
To make an orderd list you will need to type "&lt;ol&gt;" to start and "&lt;/ol&gt;" to end
Same rules accure with "&lt;li&gt;" to start the list of items and "&lt;/li&gt;" to end

Starting with CSS:
"&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;" to start the website look sexy! "&lt;/style&gt;" to end it
Between the two brackets you will now need to add "p {colour:blue;}" you can also add "p {colour:blue};font-family:arial}"
To make it look better you can seperate the rules, do this by doing "p {colour:blue;
                                                                           font-family:arial;
																		   }
RGB Colours are found on Photoshop colour picker or on websites. If you use RGB, you will need to do "h1/p/whatever {colour:#RGB Number;}
To change the width of your paragraphs, you will need to type: "p {line-height:Percentage%;}" [This will be inbetween "&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;" and "&lt;/style&gt;" [125-130% is good]
Best way to make text bold is by doing it through CSS "p/ul/ol or whatever {front-weight:bold;} [This is between "&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;" and "&lt;/style&gt;"]
Best way to change the font to italic is through CSS "p/ul/ol or whatever {font-style:italic;) [Also between "&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;" and "&lt;/style&gt;"]
To change where the title is placed you will have to type: "h3/h4/h5 or whatever {text-align:center;} [You can also use "
To indent a paragraph you will have to use "p {text-indent:"Number of Pixels/Percentage"}
To change the overall Font/Font Colour/Background Image or Background Colour, you will need to "Body {
																					background-colour:colour you want; [Background Colour]
																					colour:colour you want; [Font Colour]
																					font:font you want [Font]
																					background-image:url(FileName); [Background Image]
																					background-repeat:no-repeat; [To have one big Background Image]
																					background-repeat:repeat-x; [Repeat Longways]
																					background-repeat:repeat-y; [Repeat Up and Down]
																					background-position: "Size from Left hand size" "How far down" [Image in a certain position]
																					background-position: 50% 50% [To center the picture]
																					}
To change the padding, you will need to type inbetween "style," "h1/h2/h3/h4 or whatever     h1/h2/h3 or whatever {background-colour:colour;
																													  padding:Number of Pixels; [All Directions]
																													  padding-top:Number of Pixels; [Top]
																													  padding-bottom:Number of Pixels; [Bottom]
																								                      padding-left:Number of Pixels; [Left]
																								                      padding-right:Number of Pixels; [Right]
																								                      {
To change the border using CSS, you will need to type this inbetween "&lt;style&gt;" and "&lt;/style&gt;"    border-colour:colour; [Colour]
																									border-width:Number of Pixels; [Width]
																									border-style:dashed [Border Pattern][there are a lot more borders, search for them online!]
																									{
