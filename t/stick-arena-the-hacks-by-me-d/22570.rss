    <title>Stick Arena - The hacks, by Me =D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stick-arena-the-hacks-by-me-d/22570</link>
    <description>Hey all, I just wanted to let you all know - Stick Arena hacking is fun :D If any of you are interested in a trainer or anything, Ill post a link to it, or you can add me on MSN - meateaterr@hotmail.com.

For info on what thy hack does, thats a good question. It features [b]Health Hack, Speed Hack, Ghost Hack, Reload Hack, Anti-Lag hack, Mod Client hack, Black name hack, and you can make it seem like your logged it so no one can kick you if they know your cheating (they obviously will, too).[/b] It works great and I got rank 3 in 1 day/night. Its immensely fun shooting a shotty without reloading :D

Post, Discuss!

              <p>Well, it is jakes, but im not advertising it really. I said if you wanted it, I have it. If I were advertising, Id be selling it, or giving his website or something. What I meant to mean was, if you hack too, talk about it, and if you want to hack, I have the trainer. BTW his trainer pwns. And anti-lag does what it says - it reduces lag. I dont know how, but it works. Because if you have speed hack on with anti-lag, you can run through walls. Plus, the log out thing basically logs you out, but keeps you logged in. Because everyone voted me off and it said I left, but i was still on the server <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>That sounds very familiar… is that j4kes trainer… since if it is, you’d better have permission to advertise it</p>
<p>And Krichevskoy, from my exp. with Stick Arena Hacking, I think it just prevents you from being kicked out of the game because of lag (ftp?.. darn what was the name of that thing…) Still there are drawbacks, for example, you could disconnect from the game but still be connected in some way. Everyone else becomes frozen to you.</p>
<p>WTF, the forums said i double posted but there is no post…</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh yeh krichevskoy, was it you  who had that signature back at kaitnieks that said something like: No cute, fuzzy creatures were tortured,hurt… etc. XD? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
