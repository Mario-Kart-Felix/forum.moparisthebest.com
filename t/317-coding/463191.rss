    <description>~CODING YOUR SERVER~
coding can get difficult, and confusing at times. but if you follow my instructions you should kinda get the idea of how to do it this also includes, changing log-in info, adding objects, customizing weapons, adding npc drops, adding npc&#39;s, adding texts to server and changing exp rates along with changing npc&#39;s combat and health points, and finally creating your own compiler.bat! (additional/not required).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changing the log-in info
the log-in info is what the chatbar says when you log in
Example: Welcome to Allstar-Scape owner is allstar
all the things like that. this will show you how to do it yourself from the source you downloaded.

1. once you have your source, open it up and find a notepad called &quot;client&quot; or &quot;client.java&quot;.
2. press Ctrl+F you will get a search bar. now type in the name of the source you downloaded.
3. it will highlight w/e your the source name is. delete that and put your server name in.
4. keep on doing this over and over until the search box cant find it anymore.
--------------------Adding objects to the game-----------------------------------------
this is on how to add banks, trees, or whatever you want to your server. its really easy and can be fun in the end.

1. first go into your client.java or a notepad called client.
2. press CTRL+F and find this code:
makeGlobalObject(2757, 3483, 2213, 0, 10);
this is an object in your game. this one is a shop.
the 2757 represents the object ID, the 3483 and 2213 are the coordinates, the 0 and the 10, u just add because you just do.
3. once you have that code, scroll to the bottom of the object list, and enter the code under all the others. change whatever you want it to be.
------------------------------ADDING NPC&#39;S----------------------------------------------
1. to add a npc you need to go to Autospawn.cfg, or it may be just called Autospawn.
2. scroll all the way to the bottom, and one line before [endofspawnlist] type in:
spawn = (npcid) (cordx) (cordy) 0 0 0 1 (discription)
3. remember to space it out evenly by pressing tab after every number.
(note): Cord X and Cord Y are the positions of where ever you are standing.
(note): This allows you to add shops,monsters etc.
------------------------Adding items to shops--------------------------------------------
1. first off go into shops.cfg or it may be called shops.
2. scroll to the bottom of the shop list and add this code:
(shopID) (shopname)-sell-buy--item--amount--item--amount
this keeps on going over and over.
-for the shop id put in the person u want to trade.
-for the shop name put in w/e you want to name the shop
-for sell put in 2, same for buy
-for item and item amount, put in the item ID and the amount of the item that they sell.
-----------------------ADDING NPC DROPS------------------------------------------
(note): go into NPCDROPS not DROPS, drops is where an item automatically appears every few seconds. NPCDROPS is what the npc drops when you kill it
(note): you have to follow the AUTOSPAWN rules before you can add NPC drops.
1.First off spawn a npc that you want in the autospawn.cfg
2. now go into NPCDROPS and put in this code:
npcdrop = (npcid) (droptype) (item) (amount)
3. you can get the item id&#39;s and many other id&#39;s from the Item folder.
-----------------------ADDING TEXTS TO SERVER---------------------------------
this is to show you how to edit things like for example
Varrock teleport in the spell book, when you right click on it it says teleport to varrock, and the discription under it says Varrock teleporting spell or whatever... this show you how to change what it says.
1. go into TextHandler notepad and press CTRL+F and find:
Teleports you to Varrock. or what ever the discription says. and that you just change to w/e you want.
-------------------------CHANGING ITEM STATS------------------------------------
This show you how to change the stats of an item. say i wanted to make a bronze dagger able to hit 500 this is how to do it
1. go into a folder called &quot;Config&quot; and find another notepad called Item.
2. press CTRL+F and find whatever the item is you want to change.
3. The first 2 numbers beside it are the amount you buy and sell it for. the rest of the numbers are the att,mage,def,str,range bonuses.
4. so just change the stats, item price to whatever you want.
-----------------------CHANGING EXP RATE-----------------------------------------
1. first find out what it says when you raise a level in whatever it is you want to change.
EXAMPLE:
i raise a Theiving level and it says &quot;congradulations you have just raised a level in Theiving&quot;
2. take that and go to Client.java, type in whatever it says when you raise that level that you want to change, under it it should have a code like this:

case 2565:
TheifStall(&quot;silver stall&quot;, &quot;and recieve 900k&quot;, 91, 11000*playerLevel[17], 995, 900000, 30, 0x340);

The 995, is the item code
The 900000 is the amount of the item i get
340 is the amount of xp i get when i steal from the stall, and the 30 i don&#39;t kno.
3. all you want to do is change the 340 to the amount of xp you want every time you hit a monster, steal from a stall etc.

----------------------------CHANGING NPC CMBT AND HP--------------------------------
this is on how to change a npc&#39;s combat and health points, before you do this you have to know how to Autospawn, which i told you how to do before this.
1. spawn the npc that you want to change the health and combat.
2. go into NPC.cfg and find the npc that you want to change. (you can get the codes from lists file)
3. you should see a code that looks like this:
npc = (npcid) (npcname) (combat) (health)
4. just change what ever the npc you want to change. by puting numbers in the slots for combat and health</description>

              <p>I am new to this coding thing and I have been looking at tutorials for an hour now. I downloaded a source called Delta ++ and a client. I went to the source and clicked “Run”. Then I waited till it loaded everything. Then I went to the client and ran it. The client would show up and I thought it would load, so I looked at the load bar and it said “Connection Error - Retrying in 5”. I don’t understand, can someone please help? If you need screenshot for a better understanding, here it is.<br>

actually the 2757 represents the absX, posX, ( whatever) and the 2213 is the ID of the object wich in this case is a bank, the o and the 10 its not just added because you just do, the 0 is the orientation ( north, east, south, west) and the 10 is the rotation.[/quote]<br>
10 is the type of the object (wall objects 0-3, wall decoration 3-7?, floor items, walls ect…)</p>

<p>You can just replace it all.</p>

<p>Its not a shop is bank, also not all servers have this: makeGlobalObject(2757, 3483, 2213, 0, 10);<br>
you could’ve just searched for makeglobalobject</p>

<p>discription? dafuk is that?</p>

<p>client.java shouldn’t start with a capital letter.</p>
<p>anyways gj, i guess, might be helpful for people that can’t use the search bar.<br>
also, use [size=24pt]tags please[/size]</p>

              <h2>~CODING YOUR SERVER~<br>
coding can get difficult, and confusing at times. but if you follow my instructions you should kinda get the idea of how to do it this also includes, changing log-in info, adding objects, customizing weapons, adding npc drops, adding npc’s, adding texts to server and changing exp rates along with changing npc’s combat and health points, and finally creating your own compiler.bat! (additional/not required).</h2>
<p>Changing the log-in info<br>
the log-in info is what the chatbar says when you log in<br>
Example: Welcome to Allstar-Scape owner is allstar<br>
all the things like that. this will show you how to do it yourself from the source you downloaded.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>once you have your source, open it up and find a notepad called “client” or “client.java”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>press Ctrl+F you will get a search bar. now type in the name of the source you downloaded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it will highlight w/e your the source name is. delete that and put your server name in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep on doing this over and over until the search box cant find it anymore.<br>
--------------------Adding objects to the game-----------------------------------------<br>
this is on how to add banks, trees, or whatever you want to your server. its really easy and can be fun in the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first go into your client.java or a notepad called client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>press CTRL+F and find this code:<br>
makeGlobalObject(2757, 3483, 2213, 0, 10);<br>
this is an object in your game. this one is a shop.<br>
the 2757 represents the object ID, the 3483 and 2213 are the coordinates, the 0 and the 10, u just add because you just do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>once you have that code, scroll to the bottom of the object list, and enter the code under all the others. change whatever you want it to be.<br>
------------------------------ADDING NPC’S----------------------------------------------</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to add a npc you need to go to Autospawn.cfg, or it may be just called Autospawn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>scroll all the way to the bottom, and one line before [endofspawnlist] type in:<br>
spawn = (npcid) (cordx) (cordy) 0 0 0 1 (discription)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remember to space it out evenly by pressing tab after every number.<br>
(note): Cord X and Cord Y are the positions of where ever you are standing.<br>
(note): This allows you to add shops,monsters etc.<br>
------------------------Adding items to shops--------------------------------------------</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first off go into shops.cfg or it may be called shops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>scroll to the bottom of the shop list and add this code:<br>
(shopID) (shopname)-sell-buy–item–amount–item–amount<br>
this keeps on going over and over.<br>
-for the shop id put in the person u want to trade.<br>
-for the shop name put in w/e you want to name the shop<br>
-for sell put in 2, same for buy<br>
-for item and item amount, put in the item ID and the amount of the item that they sell.<br>
-----------------------ADDING NPC DROPS------------------------------------------<br>
(note): go into NPCDROPS not DROPS, drops is where an item automatically appears every few seconds. NPCDROPS is what the npc drops when you kill it<br>
(note): you have to follow the AUTOSPAWN rules before you can add NPC drops.<br>
1.First off spawn a npc that you want in the autospawn.cfg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>now go into NPCDROPS and put in this code:<br>
npcdrop = (npcid) (droptype) (item) (amount)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can get the item id’s and many other id’s from the Item folder.<br>
-----------------------ADDING TEXTS TO SERVER---------------------------------<br>
this is to show you how to edit things like for example<br>
Varrock teleport in the spell book, when you right click on it it says teleport to varrock, and the discription under it says Varrock teleporting spell or whatever… this show you how to change what it says.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>go into TextHandler notepad and press CTRL+F and find:<br>
Teleports you to Varrock. or what ever the discription says. and that you just change to w/e you want.<br>
-------------------------CHANGING ITEM STATS------------------------------------<br>
This show you how to change the stats of an item. say i wanted to make a bronze dagger able to hit 500 this is how to do it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>go into a folder called “Config” and find another notepad called Item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>press CTRL+F and find whatever the item is you want to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first 2 numbers beside it are the amount you buy and sell it for. the rest of the numbers are the att,mage,def,str,range bonuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so just change the stats, item price to whatever you want.<br>
-----------------------CHANGING EXP RATE-----------------------------------------</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first find out what it says when you raise a level in whatever it is you want to change.<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
i raise a Theiving level and it says “congradulations you have just raised a level in Theiving”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take that and go to Client.java, type in whatever it says when you raise that level that you want to change, under it it should have a code like this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>case 2565:<br>
TheifStall(“silver stall”, “and recieve 900k”, 91, 11000*playerLevel[17], 995, 900000, 30, 0x340);</p>
<p>The 995, is the item code<br>
The 900000 is the amount of the item i get<br>
340 is the amount of xp i get when i steal from the stall, and the 30 i don’t kno.<br>
3. all you want to do is change the 340 to the amount of xp you want every time you hit a monster, steal from a stall etc.</p>
<p>----------------------------CHANGING NPC CMBT AND HP--------------------------------<br>
this is on how to change a npc’s combat and health points, before you do this you have to know how to Autospawn, which i told you how to do before this.</p>
<ol>
<li>spawn the npc that you want to change the health and combat.</li>
<li>go into NPC.cfg and find the npc that you want to change. (you can get the codes from lists file)</li>
<li>you should see a code that looks like this:<br>
npc = (npcid) (npcname) (combat) (health)</li>
<li>just change what ever the npc you want to change. by puting numbers in the slots for combat and health</li>
</ol>
