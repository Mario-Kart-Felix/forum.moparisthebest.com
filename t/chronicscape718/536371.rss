    <description>Hey all I have another server out after the fall of Fantasyscape. It will now be called Chronicscape (As was the name of my old servers I just thought to bring it back). I will be bringing the best to you again and more content this time! I have been working on fixing things and adding more stuff. I will also take suggestions from players as well as the server goes on. I self host still and will be 24/7 so dont frown lol it will be on!
