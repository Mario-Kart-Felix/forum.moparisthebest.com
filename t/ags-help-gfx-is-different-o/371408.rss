    <title>Ags help, gfx is different =o</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ags-help-gfx-is-different-o/371408</link>
    <description> hello, I am making a 317, it&#39;s a PI server so that&#39;ll help you figure out my problem... Any ways I was on today I was checking out all the items like to see if their was ags, claws, that kind of stuff.. Any ways I spawned the ags and it came out to look like a blurite sword that is gray. Also its shown the same way in the player inventory... So my question is what file can I fix it in maybe a class file of some sort. do I call sprite 11694 to get the godsword  sprite I want i dont mean ::item i mean calling sprites. It has special, and all the other godsword&#39;s have their sprite correctly... Also another thing when you dismantle the godsword the hilt and blade look like the actually godsword so when I use them on each other they should combine but they don&#39;t. So if you could help me with this it would be a life saver... I will be on here again soon because I also have to add claws.
Thanks!</description>

<p>No i mean sprites, unless the models are also incorrect.[/quote]I don’t understand what you meant, but the godsword hits like a regular godsword and the spec works too, its just how it looks that different.</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>do you mean models?[/quote]</p>
<p>No i mean sprites,</p>
<p>But I guess looking at the picture, the models are incorrect as well.</p>
<p>Probably more efficient just to re-add Godswords.</p>

I did use code 11694 so it shouldn’t like look it does. I want it to look like a gs like all the other ones, also it is named armadyl godsword. 1 more thing, the spec works perfectly! So I think the sprite was overridden.<br>
