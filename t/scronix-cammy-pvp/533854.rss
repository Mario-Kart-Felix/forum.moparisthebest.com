    <title>Scronix: Cammy PvP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scronix-cammy-pvp/533854</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;m here because I (obviously) need one or two people that are willing to help me develop a cammy pvp server. I looked back at some of the threads and there were several cammy pvp ones, which motivated me to start one (again) aswell. I still have my own server files which are from the same revision, but with a lot of upgrades, which we will be using. I will provide as much information about the current server files as you want on Skype.

Just leave a message here with your Skype (or via PM) and I&#39;ll contact you as soon as possible :)!</description>
