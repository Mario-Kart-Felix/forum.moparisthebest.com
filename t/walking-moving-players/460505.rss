    <title>Walking / Moving players</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/walking-moving-players/460505</link>
    <description>I have been experimenting with a few of the walking methods to make a player walk to a specific coordinate on command. There is no real reason for this, just simply exploring how the walking works and could come into use with many other things such as skilling, pking or miscellaneous activities. 

I&#39;ve come to a few problems. I&#39;ve been able to make the player move squares successfully, however it&#39;s not really what I&#39;m looking for. If I type the following
[code]
::moveplayer 0001 0001
[/code]
It will move him one square on X, and one square on Y, and you can keep increasing the numbers for further distances/directions etc... So that would come in handy for say, firemaking or something, where you can control small distances.

However would it be possible to make something that would move a player to a specific coordinate?
[code]
::moveplayer 3155 3169
[/code]

So instead of just the one square movements, it would run to specified coordinates given in the command? If someone could point me in the right direction at what I&#39;m supposed to be looking at it would be appreciated.</description>

              <p>Yes, on some servers there is a walking queue. Just place that coordinate as the next point on the players queue with the command.</p>
