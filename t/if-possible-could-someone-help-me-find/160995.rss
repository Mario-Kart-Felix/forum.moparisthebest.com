              <p>… i dont think you really got it, you cant really fix it, you must download the source again, hopefully from a different link so you get the full version with Worldobjects.cfg…<br>
andd, it might not be worldobjects, it could just be objects.cfg, check in your folders for that file. Although were gonna need someone elses help to figure out how to make it so it recognizes object.cfg if that is the problem</p>
