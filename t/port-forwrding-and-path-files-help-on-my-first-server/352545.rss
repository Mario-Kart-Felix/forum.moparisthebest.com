    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwrding-and-path-files-help-on-my-first-server/352545</link>
    <description>Background~
Im using pk planets sorce for a 317 or which ever one it may be, i cant seem to wright the path and class path files, im following the &quot;how to make a server&quot; tut from the index.

Whats not working~
under Environmental variables, there was no CLASSPATH, file so i created one and under the value i copy and pasted what the classpath file is spouse to say, and the path file i deleted what it said and replaced it with what the PATH file was spouse to say, when i did ipconfig on CMD, i got a messege that it wasnt recagnized as a intarnal or external command, and i play another server and i thought id take a break and tryed to run it and it dint work eather, i serched env. varab. on wikipidea and copy and pasted what the path file was spouse to say, after i fixed the path files and deleted the classpath file i rebooted my computer and the client was working again.

What i need~
~Write the PATH &amp; CLASSPATH files
~Portforward, i have a linkins wireless router so its a lot diffrent [looks a lot diffrent] than the tut so i dont know how to forward it correctlly
~No-ip, how to i connect it with my server, i made a host thing for it
~Getting it online [as in i cant log on and i want to launch ut]
~Also i want to know how to add new items from making the codes and making it from scratch like for a new cape, will you use a normal cape and just use it with paint to fix it up?

              <p>[quote=“I Vain I, post:1, topic:352554”]To find the Ip using Command Prompt.</p>
<p>Start &gt; Run &gt; “CMD”<br>
“cd C:\WINDOWS\system32”<br>
“ipconfig”</p>
<p>Do not use the quotations while typing in Command Prompt.</p>
<p>For the No-IP issue, you just make a host.<br>
Other users will connect via the host, while you connect with localhost.</p>
<p>Getting it online:<br>
Make sure the server is running, and the client is connecting to localhost (127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0, localhost)<br>
To change the IP the client is connecting to, look for GUI, EGUI, or jFrame (if it’s renamed) classes.</p>
<p>Look for the Serverip string.[/quote]</p>
<p>dude i need to write the class and path files under environmental variables, forward my port and connect my no ip to the server so i can log in [and other people], can u just do team view and show me how beacause i dint get much of what you just said here</p>
