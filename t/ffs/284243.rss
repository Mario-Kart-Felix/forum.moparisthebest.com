    <description>I know this isn&#39;t some kind of development but...

This forum is completely bullshit by the fucking Rs2 noobs that come in it every single day. It&#39;s pissing me off so much... Do they know how to read? nope... they just think they post everywhere to get help, or just don&#39;t bother to read and post anywhere they want to. It&#39;s pathetic....

THIS IS RUNESCAPE CLASSIC
http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/RuneScape_Classic

Just read these information ffs..

http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/RuneScape
http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/RuneScape_Classic

There is a difference between the 2 games, so stop posting in RSC forum...
Its not getting you any help, you/ your  threads are only getting removed and getting you muted etc.

What is Runescape Classic??
Runescape Classic is a 2D game made by Jagex in the early year of 2000.

There is a difference to the Runescape (normal game out) and RS Classic, so stop posting in this bloody section.

Thankyou,

Hope you learnt your lessons noob.</description>

<p>Well Rsc Private servers are illegal because it’s copyright, if your talking about making RSC forums, I think there’s already a few out there. But this is the most popular RSC forums where the good coders come on. Although if your talking about making their forums like this, it’s not our decision but we can rant about it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Runescape (2) threads in this entire RSC section are pissing me off by the lack of people reading, or understanding how RSC differs to the normal Runescape.<br>

<p>Did you honestly read and interpret my post correctly? I never mentioned anything about RSC private servers <em>not</em> being illegal (there’s no reason what-so-ever to mention that here, by the way). What I was talking about, however, was that I suggested that one way to solve this issue, would be to have some form of verification-process before access to this part of the forums were to be granted. This verification-process does not necessarily have to contain any more information than a simple “I would like to have access to the RSC-private server section of <a href="http://MoparScape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">MoparScape.org</a>.” message to any responsible moderator etc.[/quote]<br>

Why not just go on and do the same thing Jagex did with their forums and the RuneScape Classic section? Like, if you want to be part of the RuneScape Classic development section of this site, they ask anyone in charge of it, who then grant them access. If they do not ask, then they won’t even see this part of the forums - simple as that… The people who really do want to be here will ask, and they also know what this section is all about - so they won’t post alot of stuff about RuneScape (2) in here…<br>

<p>This forum is completely bullshit by the fucking Rs2 noobs that come in it every single day. It’s pissing me off so much… Do they know how to read? nope… they just think they post everywhere to get help, or just don’t bother to read and post anywhere they want to. It’s pathetic…</p>
<p>THIS IS RUNESCAPE CLASSIC<br>

<p>There is a difference between the 2 games, so stop posting in RSC forum…<br>
Its not getting you any help, you/ your  threads are only getting removed and getting you muted etc.</p>
<p>What is Runescape Classic??<br>
Runescape Classic is a 2D game made by Jagex in the early year of 2000.</p>
<p>There is a difference to the Runescape (normal game out) and RS Classic, so stop posting in this bloody section.</p>
<p>Thankyou,</p>
<p>Hope you learnt your lessons noob.</p>
