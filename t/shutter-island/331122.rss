    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shutter-island/331122</link>
    <description>Just saw it and I thought it was great. The ending was amazing.

Basically about a marshall (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) who goes into an island - used as a ward to develop psychological treatments on people who have been diagnosed with insanity - after a patient has escaped. Upon the realization that there is something fishy going on, he goes into extreme depths to find out what is truly taking place on the island. During an encounter with a fugitive ex-employee of the facility, he is told that the occurrences that are truly taking place on the island are illegal and potentially fatal neuronic experiments with the patients and he is told that they will use a prior tragedy that had recently befell him (the murder of his wife) as a supplementary factor to declare him insane, thus issuing his permanent steady on the island.

I won&#39;t continue the synopsis since the end is truly great and not worth spoiling.

Anyone else seen it?</description>

              <p>Call me weird but I only just saw this movie. “To live as a monster? Or to die as a good man?”. In the end he chooses to get lobo w/e so that he wouldn’t have to live knowing what he did to his wife. What was the bandage on Andrews head there for? Was he already lobo w/e’d on already? Was the lady in the cave and the man in the cell all illusions in his head? I noticed that everything telling him that the operation there was evil seemed to be more unrealistic. I can tell this movie is gonna keep me thinking before I finally fall asleep.</p>

Titanic was incredible for a 90s film. And it had substance that many movies lack.<br>
It is a bit lovey dovey at the end of the day, but that doesn’t break the movie.</p>

              <p>By the way, after discussing the movie with a friend, he actually told me that the movie, just as the book it was based on, was written in a way so that the reader/viewer could interpret what had actually elapsed in two different ways.</p>

<p>“Better to die as a good man than to live as a monster”.</p>
<p>I had to analyze that line for about three minutes before actually figuring out what had happened. He was figuratively alluding to the fact that the treatment HAD worked and despite the fact that he did remember everything, he preferred to stay living within his delusion.[/quote]<br>
I didn’t really pick out the relevance of his last line, but now that you mentioned it I only loved this movie more. I have yet to see a shit movie with Leonardo DiCaprio in it.</p>
