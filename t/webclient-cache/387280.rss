    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-cache/387280</link>
    <description>Basically the client wont compile without 3 files inside it.
cache , raw , sprites however these files should all be together in 1 cache folder but when i do that the client will not compile without lots of errors. This problem is making it so i cant pull cache correctly and also cannot setup a webclient. could anyone maybe have a go setting it up [Pi] base. for 20$ or maybe give me some pointers</description>
