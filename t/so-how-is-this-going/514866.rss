    <title>So how is this going?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-how-is-this-going/514866</link>
    <description>Just curious, seeing as blake&#39;s account has since been deleted and no new posts have been made in quite a while.

In my opinion, given the state of the game now (i.e., players come here because they don&#39;t like new versions of the Runescape game... or they did until the so-called Old School Runescape grabbed at that market share), you should worry less about version-agnostic infrastructure. At the end of the day, how much does it really matter anyway?</description>

              <p>Yeah, it honestly looks like that any market for private servers is going to be either really early (317), or somewhere pre-EOC. And since Jagex has taken back the emulation community’s market share with their release of OSR, I agree that it’s not worth it.</p>
