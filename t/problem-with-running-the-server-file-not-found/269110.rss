    <title>Problem with running the server (File not found)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-running-the-server-file-not-found/269110</link>
    <description>Every time I go to run my base source, brezzy, I get this:
[code]Br33zy 2.0 - Created by Br33zy
-------------------------------------------------------
Loading npcs... npc.cfg: file not found.
drops... npcdrops.cfg: file not found.
spawn list...autospawn.cfg: file not found.
done!
item.cfg: file not found.
globaldrops.cfg: file not found.
doors.cfg: file not found.
shops.cfg: file not found.
objects.cfg: file not found.
[/code]

I&#39;ve tried moving the files out of the config folder, changing the path, and every other way that you could imagine and it still just can&#39;t find the files. Why could this be??</description>

              <p>I can log into it fine and move around but none of the things that are in any of those files work. For instance, my weapon gives no bonuses.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 23, 2009, 02:13:22 pm[/size][hr]Sorry about the double post but I just tried something else that didn’t work. I dragged the entire file to the window, copying the whole path, and it still didn’t work.</p>
<p>EDIT: I GOT IT!!! W00T! There was a part that looked in the config folder that had it as config\ and on mac it is config/</p>
