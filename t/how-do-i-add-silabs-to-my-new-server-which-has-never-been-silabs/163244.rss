              <p>stop spamming my thread please! i really want help with my server, none of you have any consideraition to help me at all, you never know, some kid could try coding and be the most advanced coder in the world, but you take that chance away from them and make them stay sitting down having no idea, what the heck to do with his new server, he knows how to host, how to change admin and mods, add items to accounts but not code, PLEASE help me i am so desperate to add silabs, it would be awesome. thanks for your consideraition if you do help me</p>
