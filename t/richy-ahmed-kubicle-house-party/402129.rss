much respect for this man, so fucking cool, love going out listening to this.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the last year British house music has been through a renaissance with a whole new generation of DJs and producers like Robert James, Subb-an, Russ Yallop and Maya Jane Coles quickly making names for themselves. In the midst of this surge of homegrown talent is Richy Ahmed, Hot Natured resident and part of the Hot Creations inner circle. Richy has spent the last two summers cutting his teeth at some world’s best parties including, Detroit’s Electronic Music Festival, Sonar in Barcelona, The Nexus at Burning Man in the middle of the Nevada desert, Glastonbury Festival’s 40th Anniversary, Kubicle’s legendary toilet parties in London and We Love at Space in Ibiza. Playing alongside some of house music’s biggest stars, Richy is regularly tipped as one to watch by the likes of Jamie Jones, Damian Lazarus, Clive Henry and Seth Troxler. Hailing from Newcastle in the north of the UK, he still makes regular appearances at events across the UK such as Below in Birmingham, MuMu in Liverpool, The Breakfast Club in Bristol and London’s notorious Sunday afterhours institution Kubicle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
