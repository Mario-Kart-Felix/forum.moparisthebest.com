    <title>Bush TAKES BLAME IN IRAQ, adds troops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bush-takes-blame-in-iraq-adds-troops/46189</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]WASHINGTON[/b] (CNN) -- President Bush on Wednesday night will announce a plan to send about 20,000 more troops to Iraq in an effort to pacify Baghdad, a U.S. official said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/10/iraq.bush/

...edit by Ron, had to change title. It&#39;s much more clear. Here is a different opinion from yahoo. CNN tends to be more biased. Try this article as well.

How do you figure that? Renting would cost a few hundred dollars every month? I don’t know about American wages, but over here that’s highly unrealistic for 15 year olds.<br>

<p>Your right. scrap the idea about the apartment, overall my point was that it was his choice for signing up.</p>

<p>lol good point, but also, a lot of people join the army cause they have no money to go to college. And that’s sad. <em>sigh</em> if only… (wishful thinking)</p>
<p>Edit: I didn’t realize I posted the same article like 2 min after this one. I removed it and changed the title of this topic to make it more clear. Hope you don’t mind white castle. lol this was my original title.</p>

<p>Yeah that’s part of Bush’s new plan. I thought it was 10,000 though, guess I read wrong. I hope bush doesn’t get the funding. I hate having these poor Americans die cause of that moron. It just breaks my heart.</p>
