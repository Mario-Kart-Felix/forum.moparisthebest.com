Just been reading some stuff and I thought it would be nice to hear why you think drugs are illegal.</p>
<p>The drugs I’m talking about are the Class A, B and C drugs. Why were they originally made illegal and why have they remained to be illegal and seen as morally wrong?</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
I heard they are because the cop’s want it to them self’s… In the town I live in its about a population of 4.5k… Not much but the biggest drug bust was with over 300 marijuana plants and they dont dispose of them… There was a conspiracy for about 2 year’s about them burrying them out at the city dump but haha… Me and some other kids from school dug around for about 6 hours and found nothing… So we came to consider that they smoke it all, they cant get rid of it that fast but its about 13 cop’s and all of them are smoker’s and smoke in the car’s… So for all we know they could be smokin weed… One night I got pulled over for going 55mph in a 25 zone, the cop looked high and asked me if I was, i took a look in his eye’s and said nope but are you by any chance? and he gave me a $250 (USD) ticket for it…[/quote]<br>
I never heard of cops disposing drugs, usually they lock it up somewhere…for some reason. Sometimes drugs can be used for medical needs, so most likely they put it in the hospital. But you never know lol.</p>
