    <title>Why are drugs illegal?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-are-drugs-illegal/251258</link>
    <description>Just been reading some stuff and I thought it would be nice to hear why you think drugs are illegal. 

The drugs I&#39;m talking about are the Class A, B and C drugs. Why were they originally made illegal and why have they remained to be illegal and seen as morally wrong?</description>

I never heard of cops disposing drugs, usually they lock it up somewhere…for some reason. Sometimes drugs can be used for medical needs, so most likely they put it in the hospital. But you never know lol.[/quote]<br>
Obama is making it legal… And if not im going to AMSTERDAM!!!</p>
