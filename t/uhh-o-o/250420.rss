Whats with all the CM&#39;s and Section mods getting muted/modded/warned, etc?

Like all of the sudden it seems left and right CM&#39;s are getting infracted. Just wondering, what&#39;s with that? :o</description>

</aside>
<p>I agree with this post however by being anti-elitist they’ve taken it to being overly hard on the elitists and less hard on the non-elitists. Hence role reversal and they become biased towards themselves in the same way elitists are biased to other elitists.</p>
<p>Note, a lot of the complaints of elitism and bad moderating revolve around me, however often it isn’t me directly committing the “crime” it’s just this role the community has assigned to me as being the antichrist. I’m seen as the apparent head of the elitists, something which I never claimed to be (I am of course overjoyed they think this ;)). The point is, I began jokingly the “Greeny movement” which then escalated to something much greater than it was ever meant to be, although I’m glad it did. Before me, it was Frank_, and amongst other elitists he still is the “head” of the campaign, as can be seen through his posts.</p>
<p>There is way too much support in the way of “the movement” is it is now seen to be called. You cannot abolish elitism - in the same way you can’t abolish communism, Judaism or one of the other annoying cultures on this planet. The process of change, requires adaptation and takes time but it also requires stimulus. As I’ve said before, the community will get worse before it gets better and it wont get any better unless something drastically changes in order to spark an adaptation in the members - my previous suggestions have been broadening the board away from Runescape&amp;Moparscape but this isn’t the discussion for that.</p>
<p>My point being, us - the elitists have been around long enough to remember the golden days, the <span class="hashtag">#kaitnieks</span> days and such. We’re revolting in this time of depression, the issue being the community has been collapsing for a number of years now thus it seems like we’re just permanent cunts (whether this be poor forum management, lack of inspiration from members - who knows? I’m not going to pass judgment but I have my opinions.) It certainly isn’t member count as we have an enormous member base, apparently we’re appealing to the wrong types of people though. The point is, we (the elitists) want the old days back, they’re not coming but we’ll damn well crave for something as close as it gets. We are not ruining the forum, we want a better forum and as the most active, most intelligent and most experienced members you are doomed to fail without us and our support.</p>
