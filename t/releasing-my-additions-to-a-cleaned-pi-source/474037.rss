    <title>Releasing my additions to a cleaned PI source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/releasing-my-additions-to-a-cleaned-pi-source/474037</link>
    <description>I&#39;m giving up on this. I thought it was a good server base, but everything is jumbled, cluttered, and stuffed into one big file. Private servers just need a general overhaul of how they&#39;re organized in general...

What I added...

 (There aren&#39;t  any pictures because this is a BLANK [PI] source (downloaded from Sanity&#39;s original thread.)

    
[ul][li]Added Server Control Panel
    Added in JRebel for downtime free updating
    Added in 2 starters per IP
    Rewrote combat
    Fixed Duel Arena from trapping people
    Updated prices of many, many items to balance economy
    Fixed some dupes (more to be fixed)
    Dropped engine load from 32% to 0-1%. 
    Lvlpts added, lvl pts shop under work. (Suggestions for lvl pt shop items are welcome) (So far, rares are only items.) Use ::mylvlpts to check current amount of points. 1 point is added for each level up.  (fixed so that level up pts are added for each individual level, plus 15 for a 99.)
    99 Level Up Message (Finished. Announces skill to 99 + gives skill cape/hood)
    Caskets Added to lvlpts shop.
    Added dragon full helm, godswords, godsword disamantling and assembling, dragon fire shield (working spec.) + many, many item models.
    Fixed most dupes
    Added Slots
    Added casket rewards, including bandos hilt.
    More shop items added
    Exp Rate/GP/Level Points balanced for good economy
    KBD drops added.
    Whip Requirements fixed
    Added EXP Lamps (+250K exp/ instant level 63 in any skill,  dropped by kbd, and in level pt shop)

used some tutorials, added in some of my own content, completely reworked some tutorials to fit in a better way. find them yourself..[/li]
[li][/li][/ul]


I doubt anyone will find this to be anything new or amazing... The only truly new addition to this aside from general fixes is this little bit of code: added in Player assistant in every stat.

[code]	case 0: // Attack
	c.lvlPoints += getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[0]) + 1;
	PlayerSave.saveGame(c);
		sendFrame126(&quot;Congratulations, you just advanced an Attack level!&quot;, 6248);
		sendFrame126(&quot;Your Attack level is now &quot; + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[skill]) + &quot;.&quot;, 6249);
		c.sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations, you just advanced an Attack level.&quot;);	
		sendFrame164(6247);
		if (getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[skill]) &lt;= 98)
			break;
		for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++) {
			if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] == null)
				continue;
			Client all = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
			all.sendMessage(&quot;[Server] &quot; + c.playerName + &quot; has just achieved level &quot; + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[skill]) + &quot; Attack!&quot;);
		}
		c.lvlPoints +=15;
		PlayerSave.saveGame(c);
		c.getItems().addItem(9748, 1);
		c.getItems().addItem(9749, 1);
		break;[/code]


I tried running this source as a server, and no one wanted to join because it didn&#39;t have amazing 602 models, and it wasn&#39;t 474 or it didn&#39;t have a fast exp rate..

 (XP is currently this)

[code]public static final int MELEE_EXP_RATE = 90; // damage * exp rate
public static final int RANGE_EXP_RATE = 90;
public static final int MAGIC_EXP_RATE = 90;[/code]

[code] public static final int WOODCUTTING_EXPERIENCE = 30;
    public static final int MINING_EXPERIENCE = 30;
    public static final int SMITHING_EXPERIENCE = 30;
    public static final int FARMING_EXPERIENCE = 30;
    public static final int FIREMAKING_EXPERIENCE = 50;
    public static final int HERBLORE_EXPERIENCE = 30;
    public static final int FISHING_EXPERIENCE = 30;
    public static final int AGILITY_EXPERIENCE = 30;
    public static final int PRAYER_EXPERIENCE = 30;
    public static final int RUNECRAFTING_EXPERIENCE = 40;
    public static final int CRAFTING_EXPERIENCE = 30;
    public static final int THIEVING_EXPERIENCE = 30;
    public static final int SLAYER_EXPERIENCE = 40;
    public static final int COOKING_EXPERIENCE = 30;
    public static final int FLETCHING_EXPERIENCE = 30;[/code]

Download or don&#39;t, I could really care less. Don&#39;t comment saying that this is horrid or whatever, because I already know it is.... just a few fixes that needed to be there anyways, so I guess downloading this is better than downloading a blank source if you want a shortcut.. Otherwise, download another cleaned version and learn how to code stuff in yourself..
