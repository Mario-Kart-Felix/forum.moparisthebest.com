          <blockquote>
              <p>To make a shop first you need to pick an npc, and then you have to put it in autospawn…</p>
<p>Autospawn.cfg(Ex. Santa)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 1552	2608	3094	0	2608	3095	2607	3095	2	Santa's Holiday Shop</code></pre>
<p>the “spawn” means it will spawn the NPC(computer person) id followed by the “=” sign</p>
<p>The next two numbers “2608” and “3094” is where the npc will spawn…What you need to do is go inside a source like testscape or cheezscape when running your server and go over the spot you want him to spawn at and click on the “tools” submenu in mopar(looks like a wrench." It will tell you the coordinates.</p>
<p>Now the next 6 numbers you need to ignore and just put 0’s for them…the very last number though"2" change to 1. The “Santa’s Holiday Shop” is what is the description of the NPC you are autospawning.</p>
<p>For the Shops.CFG(Next Edit)</p>
<p>Open Up Shops.CFG(should be in config folder, same place as the autospawn.cfg file.)</p>
<p>At the very end you will see something like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = shopID#	EnterShopNameHere				2	2	ItemID#	AmountToSell	1057	20	1050	35	</code></pre>
<p>This part is relatively easy…all you do is,for instance, if your last shop ID# was 20, for this one, you put “21”</p>
<p>Next line of Code is “EnterShopNameHere” put the same description as you put in the autospawn.cfg file for the autospawned NPC(Ex.Santa’s Holiday Shop)</p>
<p>The next line of code is “2” then “2” again.</p>
<p>You will see something at the top of file on those numbers “sell” and “buy” just put 2 for both of these</p>
<p>The next code is “ItemID#” just look up an item ID# in the moparscape help submenu and scroll to bottom for itemID’s…Enter the Item Id and then enter the amount of the item you want sold there in “AmoutToSell” Code</p>
<p>For the last in final two parts go into client.java</p>
<p>Press ctrl+f and search for “//first click NPC”</p>
<p>If it is an NPC with just “talk” when you right click search this</p>
<p>Scroll Down to wanneshops and you should find some code like this…</p>
<p><code>else if (NPCID == NPCID#) { // Santa's Holiday Shop
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = 39; //Santa's Shop
} </code></p>
<p>Enter the ID number as in your autospawn.cfg file you added<br>
Also on // Santa’s Holiday Shop is the description that should be the same from the first description in autospawn.cfg,shops.cfg and now client.java.<br>
PutNPCCoords = true does not need to be edited so just leave AS IS!</p>
<p>On WanneShop = 39, enter the wanneshop # that you added in shops.cfg and then on //Santa’s Shop put a simplified description of the top description or you can keep them the same</p>
<p>Well after this save all your work compile and save…then run server!! If you have any problems PM me or email me at <a href="mailto:dogzound5@gmail.com">dogzound5@gmail.com</a></p>
