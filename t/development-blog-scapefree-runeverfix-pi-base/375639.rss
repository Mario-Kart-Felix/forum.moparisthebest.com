    <description>Hiya!

Not to flaunt, but just so you know, I&#39;ve owned 2 servers that have reached over 200 players so I&#39;m pretty sure what I&#39;m making isn&#39;t going to fail.

So! Let&#39;s get to it. I wanted to tell you about what I&#39;ve been doin&#39; and I&#39;d like to hear some constructive criticism!

I&#39;m using this source
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,468795.0.html

as a base, the client and server. Yes, that base has a ton of bugs and bugs client sided and blah. Though, I&#39;ve done quite a bit of fixing and editing
I&#39;ve been working my ass off the past 2 days (Downloaded the source 2 days ago, I promise) becauseee I want an Eco server (My current server is only pking and it has dupes and :(!!) So anyways I just wanted to share with youuu people what I&#39;ve done with it and hope to hear some nice things heh. Or flame. Whichever lolz.

I hope this doesn&#39;t count as advertising but..
I put up this webclient for my players to test out the server, and help me find bugs and to suggest things, which has really really helped. Everyone that has tested it actually has been getting really into the game, not like I coded it all because it&#39;s still mainly it&#39;s default base, BUT I did add a few things that really make people want to play, much like with my other servers. I&#39;m good at doing that.

Notice that this is not for advertising I just want to show people *Cough*deathchaos9 who deletes the most pointless shit*cough*

And here&#39;s some screenshots and additions I&#39;ve made in THE PAST 2 DAYS

PvP Timer that&#39;s 20 seconds (about)
Fixed the client-sided bug that made all NPC&#39;s walk like a penguin &gt;.&gt;
Fixed the client sided bug that made it so you couldn&#39;t use interface 199
Added a short tutorial which forces you to learn how to play so you don&#39;t ask everyone how to train &gt;.&gt; forces you to read and before you leave you have to use the stat changer.
Added click to change stats, BUT! A twist
You can ONLY change a stat to level 70, you must train the rest of the way (Combat stats and Prayer/HP), HP cannot go below 10. You can change with your armor off. Yeah I know a ton of servers have stat changing, but the &quot;No go above 70&quot; is quite unique and enhances the gameplay a ton, trust me it works in my mind.. And it&#39;s badass, because turmoil&#39;s in the normal prayer book, so it reminds me of RuneScape.. If you want turmoil, you have to work for it, but it&#39;s not a necessity. Also, you can&#39;t buy bones you have to get them. But it&#39;s a reasonable exp rate.
Removed all invisible NPC&#39;s because I cbf to fix them..
Fixed some slayer tasks being gay and bullshit
Added a thing to send a message to all whenever you get a 99, yeah same with above, everyone has that.. But I added it myself because it&#39;s QUITE an achievement on this server, TRUST MEH
Fixed the NPC drops, I hate PI drops they are gay.. Yes I simply did that C+P tut ha..
Removed the BS PvP areas, idk why the person who created it added because that&#39;s just gay to have PvP areas +0 and +1..
Changed teleports because most of them were shitty and looked stupid.
Created my own home at Lumbridge, it is pretty neat and eye-friendly, has NPC&#39;s for Thieving, Crafting, and the shop to sell crafted items to.. Only necklaces atm.
Removed their activity point system which btw was bullshit
MANY fixes to the slots some items went to..

Currently working on BEFORE releasing...
Fixing Barrows
Adding NPC drops to ALL available monsters
Removing/Adding many items to shops to create a better and more stable economy
Creating a slayer point system similar to RuneScape&#39;s
Creating an all-new PK point system to 100% prevent farming and be much better. (You get invisible PK points from killing people and get PvP drop additions to your drop, e.g. if you have 20 PK kills you can maybe get a vesta&#39;s longsword)
Creating a very nice website which will include: Highscores, Vote For Cash, Players Online, etc.
Changing most teleports..
Removing Duel Arena
Fixing any bugs I find
Adding a point in donating, e.g. Donator status and what items cost what amount etc.. Big part of releasing a server..
Completely coding a working Corporeal Beast :)
Making Clan Chat save whenever you enter one so when you login you&#39;re still in it
Adding many new training areas with monsters that drop items that can&#39;t be found anywhere else to create an economy
Completely adding a way to train EVERY skill with a FAIR amount of Exp (yes I know this source has all skills working already, but what would it matter if you could get 99 on them within an hour? I&#39;m trying to balance the time to get 99 on most skills, thus I have to make everything reasonable.. It&#39;s quite hard to be honest)
A nice and sleek quest tab with valuable information and buttons
Sooo much more. I expect to be done within a week but it could take longer.. I&#39;ll be no-lifing until then.

Now, don&#39;t call this a leech because I haven&#39;t even finished it yet, and you have no idea how much I worked my ass off these 2 days.. 

AND of course I&#39;m not showing the obvious. 602 Animations, 602 gfx, 602 Items.. All skillcape emotes working..
It has all the colored whips and dbows and shit, all chaotics and all the dungeoneering items, gameframe changer and etc but since I take no credit for that, I&#39;m not showing it or talking about it. I only am showing credit for what I did, which is what I want criticism for. I don&#39;t want to hear anything about what the original source has because that&#39;s all going to be gone before I release this</description>
