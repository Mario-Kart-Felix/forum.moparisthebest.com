[font=verdana][size=13px]All parts are ordered and on their way:[/size][/font]
- i7 3770k
- Asus GTX 680 OC
- Corsair vengeance 16gb RAM (2 x 8gb)
- Asus sabertooth z77 motherboard
- Corsair 750w modular psu
- Sandisk extreme 240gb ssd and WD 2tb
- Corsair 550d quiet midi case

[font=verdana][size=13px]Comes to just over £1400 iirc.[/size][/font]

[font=verdana][size=13px]1.  Is the psu sufficient for the GTX 680?[/size][/font]
[font=verdana][size=13px]2.  Would the cooling be fine with stock?  Will be playing a few hardcore BF3 sessions.[/size][/font]

Will get pics up within a week give or take, ordering the rest of it 24/09</description>

Awesome, will probably end up getting an aftermarket heatsink once it all arrives in 2 or 3 days, after all, I did get a silent case, which of course comes at a cost of cooling performance :o</p>
<p>EDIT: all arrived last night, turns out it was a faulty motherboard, sending it back on tuesday, so pissed right now</p>

<p>The 3820 is designed more around performance, overclocking etc. it’s one of the best CPUs for overclocking on the current market, I’ve got the 3820 with the gigabyte X79-UD5 motherboard however the UD5 is a fair lump more expensive than the motherboard you chose, so I would go for the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gigabyte-SKT-2011-X79-UD3-Motherboard-Rev/dp/B006678H3I/ref=sr_1_2?s=computers&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348403706&amp;sr=1-2" data-bbcode="true">X79-UD3</a> which is pretty much an identical motherboard, just with 4 less RAM slots.</p>

Pretty motherboard, I’m loving the ‘armour’ plate on the Asus motherboard though, it’s got really great reviews too <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Are the performance benefits that huge though?  I think I’ll look up some benchmarks and possibly reconsider.</p>

That’s odd, 3770k beats it in every single category according to that source…</p>

Ah good, cheers.  And I believe it does come with a heatsink, however I know the 3820 does not as my friend got it about 6 months ago.<br>
Reasoning for not picking the 3820 would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not Ivybridge/latest technology</li>
<li>Lack of integrated graphics (just in case)</li>
<li>Requires quad channel memory, less flexibility in my opinion.</li>
<li>Lack of included heatsink and lack of choice of heatsink due to unique socket</li>
<li>Motherboard choice is restricted due to the different/uncommon socket</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, it’s only 30 quid extra, I think the reasoning above justifies that and the very minor speed gains from the 3820.</p>
