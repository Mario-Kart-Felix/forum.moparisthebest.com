    <description>[url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/gold-trading-exposed-the-developers-article?page=2]http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/gold-trading-exposed-the-developers-article?page=2[/url]

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In 2008,&quot; he says, &quot;RuneScape forums were flooded with players complaining about what they perceived as the deterioration in gameplay since anti-gold-farmer controls were introduced by Jagex at the end of 2007.&quot;

In fact, a former Jagex source tells me that when Jagex banned all IPs connected to gold selling, &quot;they lost 10 per cent of their membership, and still haven&#39;t recovered in terms of numbers since they did it two years ago. Even though they have almost stopped gold selling in RuneScape, it has cost them two million active accounts; i.e. there were four million players, there are now two million players, of which less than one million actually subscribe.&quot;

&quot;With Jagex, it was all personal,&quot; he adds. &quot;Andrew [Gower, Jagex founder] has always taken it personally - he&#39;s a gamer.&quot;

Few companies will divulge exact numbers of accounts banned, nor how swiftly they are managing to deal with the problem, other than to say: they are. There are some exceptions to the rule, of course. Jagex spokesperson Adam Tuckwell, admits, for example, that the company had problems back in 2007 &quot;which were taking up vital development time fixing, rather than developing new content of our players&quot;.

&quot;The game was becoming increasingly overcrowded with [gold sellers&#39;] bots, exploiting bugs and scamming legitimate players out of items and their accounts,&quot; he explains. &quot;RWT [real world trading] was the source of the majority of rule-breaking in RuneScape and without removing it, RWT could have ruined the game.&quot;

Tuckwell says that while real world traders claim they are running legitimate businesses, in reality it is akin to organised crime.

&quot;There is a whole industry built up around it, exploiting cheap labour and involving illegal activities. The majority of bots that we ban from members have been paid for with stolen credit card numbers.

&quot;Such accounts don&#39;t earn us money, they cost us money in bank refund charges - money that could be better spent on creating new content for our players; money that could help us increase the level of support our players receive. Also, in the longer term, if we had continued to experience these problems with account fraud, then it could have led to us no longer being able to accept credit card payments from legitimate players.&quot;

...

At Jagex, Adam Tuckwell says that the RuneScape game engine, its code, has been altered many times to break macro programs. &quot;The first Random Event - we call them anti-macro events (AMEs) - was added to the game one month after the March 2004 release of RuneScape 2. As the game has grown, the demand for gold has grown with it, so it is worth gold sellers&#39; time to make smarter bots.

&quot;We keep developing technologies to combat it, but it&#39;s like an arms race, we stop bots, they improve their macros, we stop them, they improve again. The longer we keep doing this, the harder it&#39;s going to be to keep stopping bots. If we don&#39;t break that vicious cycle now,&quot; he maintains, &quot;it would just keep getting worse and worse. It could reach a point where macro software becomes undetectable.&quot;

During 2006, Jagex banned accounts carrying RuneScape gold and items worth over 200 billion. During 2007, it banned over 525 billion, which had a real-world value of over USD 2.6 million - an increase of over 250 per cent. &quot;At that rate of growth,&quot; he said, &quot;we&#39;d be looking at banning over 8 trillion in 2010 - that&#39;s 8,000 billion - which has a real-world value of over USD 40 million. It&#39;s an almost unbelievably high number, but it hammers home the sheer size of the problem we are facing and why we had to take action against it.&quot;

...

&quot;These gold-sellers are businessmen. They&#39;re in it for the money and are going to be looking at the bottom line: their profits,&quot; agrees Adam Tuckwell of Jagex. &quot;The key phrase is &#39;not profitable&#39;. We&#39;re changing our game in a way that doesn&#39;t negatively affect its gameplay, but which makes real-world trading not worth the effort.&quot;

He mentions that Jagex has looked at any number of different possible solutions to the spammers and bots. &quot;We read independent studies and spoke with other people in the MMORPG industry. Ultimately, the consensus was that the only way to remove the real-world trading market was to develop your game so you cannot make unbalanced trades.

&quot;An unbalanced trade is where one player trades something of value to another player, but does not receive something back of roughly equal value. Real-world traders have used this method to trade millions of gold pieces in exchange for nothing in game, as they will already have been paid in real money. Removing unbalanced trade will mean real-world traders can&#39;t do this, so there is no way for them to deliver gold to buyers - and if you can&#39;t sell gold, why bother farming it in the first place?&quot;

&quot;The difficult part was not the removal of unbalanced trade,&quot; he says, &quot;but the creation of new content to replace what would be lost. This change was not taken lightly, we&#39;ve exhausted all the alternatives. We&#39;ve tried countless ways to defeat real-world trading and considered many other options to end this problem. Unbalanced trade is going from RuneScape; if anything gets lost alongside it we can find it again, new and improved, with the help and support of our players.&quot; Whatever a player now trades directly in the game has to be traded with an item of similar value.

This is a substantial change, says Tuckwell, and in order to keep the game enjoyable and ensure that trade could still happen, Jagex introduced the &#39;grade exchange&#39;, essentially a stock exchange, for players to sell their items to the highest bidder. &quot;This allowed players to buy and sell items at market rates, while removing the RWT threat,&quot; he claims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

Do you know how long it takes from 1-85 mining on ess? Runescape isn’t even advancing. As soon as they update, we have it. They have to make something worth while, something that WE can’t even DREAM of creating. I bet RuneScape isn’t even hard to code. Honestly, us kids are creating what JaGex is creating right now. I bet have of the 525+ coders could most likely code with JaGex.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the Runescape 317. Almost everyone in the MoparScape community is coding them. So what is that makes RuneScape so great? Nothing.[/quote]</p>
<p>You sir are a complete moron.  Congratulations, you are with hundreds of other morons who can copy and paste code (code which is unbearably slow, has a million bugs and is properly mostly copied from somewhere else).  I don’t think a single moparscaper could ever create something as complex as runescape.  Even with your bug-ridden copy-and-paste 512k line client.java server, which runs at about 1Hz ans has a thread-per-player architecture (wow, multi-threading’s so easy, right?), moparscape would never be able to re-create the client, even the 317 client which is now years old has not been fully refactored as far as I know (although even if it had, I dobut you’d understand any of it).<br>
Prove me wrong.</p>

If jagex was to sell gold then people would just be able to buy there skills with the money they made. It would cause them to loose so many accounts and have 11 year olds trying to riot around fally.</p>

<p>Lol. Yes, it was all asian farmers. Our community never had ANYTHING to do with it. And its not like the gold farmers used our bot for a while or anything.</p>
<p>Hypocrisy, lose it.[/quote]<br>
Actually the Asians did rune it, not us ^^. Before the Asians entered botting was average, when they came there where tons of bots on every tree.<br>
I mean now we still have bots (RSBot, Scar, Nexus etc), but you don’t see them everywhere.</p>

              <p>I agree.<br>
Gold farmers, and the credit card frauds seriously ruin the game (takes away Jagex’s funds =/)</p>
<p>Now you can’t give your friends gold, Christmas presents, etc.</p>
<p>Botting should be aloud - <span class="bbcode-b">If</span> the user is smart enough in creating a bot, but to those who cannot compile a script without a rampage on the forums, the should not be aloud to bot.<br>
But, many people don’t believe smarter people deserve better things; as in counting cards in Black Jack, you get <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span> more.</p>
<p>Personal opinion anyways.</p>
<p>Also: Botting will never stop, they will always find ways around random events.</p>

<p>Note on Moparscape: The <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> community brings down itself.</p>
<p>There are two groups: The Smart | The Idiots</p>
<p>The Smart, create the server bases from scratch, such as Paldino76 in his 503/508 servers (correct me in I’m wrong).</p>
<p>The Idiots, put there shitty code in it, and the game/source is ruined.</p>

<p>So true.  We don’t edit jack shit and we still come out with poor results.  I don’t think noobie22 has ever just looked at the coding for lunar, it’s like thousands of pages long!<br>
Also think bout it economically, if Jagex could do what they do with only 5 staff then they’d do it, they wouldn’t hire hundreds of employees just to sit around all day doing jack shit and then pay them all average wage.</p>

              <p>[quote=“runescape3dude, post:7, topic:273095”]If Jagex wants to make money, they should return the unbalanced trade and sell gold themselves to the players, just offer it cheap and say it is the only “Legitimate Gold Selling Business.”<br>
Let other people try to sell gold if they want, but JaGeX will end up earning the most, as a fair deal of the players are too useless to use any site except runescape and google.[/quote]</p>
<p>that would ruin their game faster then it could possibly be ruined and it would make them less money in the long run. the word business means making money for a long time not just 2 months and product is dead.</p>

This post makes me laugh.[/quote]</p>
<p>but that post is true they got 11 year olds programming runescape servers which makes runescape pretty poor when it comes to reverse engineering. They should make it harder</p>

<p>Yes, but Jagex should have the money anyway, stolen CC is not Jagex responsibility, its the bank or the stupid CC owner.</p>
<p>So Jagex have nothing to lose on making the game fun.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Uh, you never took credit card transactions apparently.</p>
<p>When someone uses a fraudulent CC, the merchant is the one who loses out. They don’t get the money, and if they get too many fraudulent payments they run the risk of losing their merchant account.[/quote]<br>
You are rigth.<br>
Its different here, here its the bank who most pay back the stupid user. (Not 100% sure)<br>
The merchant will not losing anything by people use stolen CC so I think.</p>
