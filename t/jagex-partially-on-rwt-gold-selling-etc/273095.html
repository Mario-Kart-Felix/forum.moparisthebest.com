<blockquote>"In 2008," he says, "RuneScape forums were flooded with players complaining about what they perceived as the deterioration in gameplay since anti-gold-farmer controls were introduced by Jagex at the end of 2007."
<p>In fact, a former Jagex source tells me that when Jagex banned all IPs connected to gold selling, “they lost 10 per cent of their membership, and still haven’t recovered in terms of numbers since they did it two years ago. Even though they have almost stopped gold selling in RuneScape, it has cost them two million active accounts; i.e. there were four million players, there are now two million players, of which less than one million actually subscribe.”</p>
<p>“With Jagex, it was all personal,” he adds. “Andrew [Gower, Jagex founder] has always taken it personally - he’s a gamer.”</p>
<p>Few companies will divulge exact numbers of accounts banned, nor how swiftly they are managing to deal with the problem, other than to say: they are. There are some exceptions to the rule, of course. Jagex spokesperson Adam Tuckwell, admits, for example, that the company had problems back in 2007 “which were taking up vital development time fixing, rather than developing new content of our players”.</p>
<p>“The game was becoming increasingly overcrowded with [gold sellers’] bots, exploiting bugs and scamming legitimate players out of items and their accounts,” he explains. “RWT [real world trading] was the source of the majority of rule-breaking in RuneScape and without removing it, RWT could have ruined the game.”</p>
<p>Tuckwell says that while real world traders claim they are running legitimate businesses, in reality it is akin to organised crime.</p>
<p>"There is a whole industry built up around it, exploiting cheap labour and involving illegal activities. The majority of bots that we ban from members have been paid for with stolen credit card numbers.</p>
<p>“Such accounts don’t earn us money, they cost us money in bank refund charges - money that could be better spent on creating new content for our players; money that could help us increase the level of support our players receive. Also, in the longer term, if we had continued to experience these problems with account fraud, then it could have led to us no longer being able to accept credit card payments from legitimate players.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At Jagex, Adam Tuckwell says that the RuneScape game engine, its code, has been altered many times to break macro programs. "The first Random Event - we call them anti-macro events (AMEs) - was added to the game one month after the March 2004 release of RuneScape 2. As the game has grown, the demand for gold has grown with it, so it is worth gold sellers’ time to make smarter bots.</p>
<p>“We keep developing technologies to combat it, but it’s like an arms race, we stop bots, they improve their macros, we stop them, they improve again. The longer we keep doing this, the harder it’s going to be to keep stopping bots. If we don’t break that vicious cycle now,” he maintains, “it would just keep getting worse and worse. It could reach a point where macro software becomes undetectable.”</p>
<p>During 2006, Jagex banned accounts carrying RuneScape gold and items worth over 200 billion. During 2007, it banned over 525 billion, which had a real-world value of over USD 2.6 million - an increase of over 250 per cent. “At that rate of growth,” he said, “we’d be looking at banning over 8 trillion in 2010 - that’s 8,000 billion - which has a real-world value of over USD 40 million. It’s an almost unbelievably high number, but it hammers home the sheer size of the problem we are facing and why we had to take action against it.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“These gold-sellers are businessmen. They’re in it for the money and are going to be looking at the bottom line: their profits,” agrees Adam Tuckwell of Jagex. “The key phrase is ‘not profitable’. We’re changing our game in a way that doesn’t negatively affect its gameplay, but which makes real-world trading not worth the effort.”</p>
<p>He mentions that Jagex has looked at any number of different possible solutions to the spammers and bots. "We read independent studies and spoke with other people in the MMORPG industry. Ultimately, the consensus was that the only way to remove the real-world trading market was to develop your game so you cannot make unbalanced trades.</p>
<p>“An unbalanced trade is where one player trades something of value to another player, but does not receive something back of roughly equal value. Real-world traders have used this method to trade millions of gold pieces in exchange for nothing in game, as they will already have been paid in real money. Removing unbalanced trade will mean real-world traders can’t do this, so there is no way for them to deliver gold to buyers - and if you can’t sell gold, why bother farming it in the first place?”</p>
<p>“The difficult part was not the removal of unbalanced trade,” he says, “but the creation of new content to replace what would be lost. This change was not taken lightly, we’ve exhausted all the alternatives. We’ve tried countless ways to defeat real-world trading and considered many other options to end this problem. Unbalanced trade is going from RuneScape; if anything gets lost alongside it we can find it again, new and improved, with the help and support of our players.” Whatever a player now trades directly in the game has to be traded with an item of similar value.</p>
<p>This is a substantial change, says Tuckwell, and in order to keep the game enjoyable and ensure that trade could still happen, Jagex introduced the ‘grade exchange’, essentially a stock exchange, for players to sell their items to the highest bidder. “This allowed players to buy and sell items at market rates, while removing the RWT threat,” he claims.</p>

        <p>I knew many macroers who had several accounts going non-stop mining iron, ess, making bow strings and then selling in order to sell their gold. They were using SCAR and SRL so it wasn’t just the asian farmers that ruined the game. It was also the caucasion, indian, mexican, cuban, and whoever else is involved in RS2 cheating.</p>

<p>I remember running like 10 at a time… All mining ess for a week, then they are at level 60 and I would mine coal at the guild. I would also buy them rune pick axes<br>
Made several million a night. When I started to sell it, you could sell it for nearly 20 dollars a million. Earlier a million gp was worth WAY more.</p>
<p>I’d get like 3 days in of mining in the guild and they would get banned.  So I’d make 10 more accounts, bot them through tutorial island, and repeat.</p>
<p>But the real cash was at neopets.</p>

        <p>If Jagex wants to make money, they should return the unbalanced trade and sell gold themselves to the players, just offer it cheap and say it is the only “Legitimate Gold Selling Business.”<br>
Let other people try to sell gold if they want, but JaGeX will end up earning the most, as a fair deal of the players are too useless to use any site except runescape and google.</p>

        <p>I’m never going to understand how RWT affected Jagex so hugely, I understand they don’t want 50% of the RuneScape population being a bot, but they are gaining the membership profits from all of it and I see no downside to it.</p>
<p>And I think after the impact they took from the mass ban before, they are scared to ban all of us again, because if I think about it it would be hella easy to detect us with a little reflection on their part, but they are choosing not to, even though it will only temporarily stop is <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

BUt they weren’t getting more money because the money used to pay for membership was a lot from stolen credit cards, or so they say   :rolleyes:<br>

Yes, but Jagex should have the money anyway, stolen CC is not Jagex responsibility, its the bank or the stupid CC owner.</p>
<p>So Jagex have nothing to lose on making the game fun.[/quote]</p>
<p>Stolen CC’s isn’t Jagex’s problem, but when they get payed by stolen CC’s the money has to be payed back if the real owner of the CC asks for it.</p>

<p>Uh, you never took credit card transactions apparently.</p>
<p>When someone uses a fraudulent CC, the merchant is the one who loses out. They don’t get the money, and if they get too many fraudulent payments they run the risk of losing their merchant account.</p>

        <p>TBH, you cannot stop botting. There is too many people that do it. My friend botted to 85 mining on ESSENCE. And did not even caught. Do you know how long it takes from 1-85 mining on ess? Runescape isn’t even advancing. As soon as they update, we have it. They have to make something worth while, something that WE can’t even DREAM of creating. I bet RuneScape isn’t even hard to code. Honestly, us kids are creating what JaGex is creating right now. I bet have of the 525+ coders could most likely code with JaGex.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the Runescape 317. Almost everyone in the MoparScape community is coding them. So what is that makes RuneScape so great? Nothing.</p>
