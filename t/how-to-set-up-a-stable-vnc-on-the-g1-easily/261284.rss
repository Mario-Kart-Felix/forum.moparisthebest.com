[CENTER][size=15pt]How to set up a stable VNC on the G1 easily[/size][/CENTER]

Hey all,

           Not sure if this information has been posted or not so I thought I’d take a chance and see I could help anyone, for those who don’t know VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing and basically allows full remote access of your computer, for this example remote access on the G1.

Let’s begin

1.	First we are going to need to get the VNC software so that the G1 can communicate with your PC, luckily the people at android development have us covered on that and have made a VNC viewer for android which is already packed into a .apk file ready to use –

[url=http://code.google.com/p/android-vnc-viewer/]http://code.google.com/p/android-vnc-viewer/[/url]

Go to the downloads section and get the latest version -[IMG]http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/9507/gooddownloadbb4.jpg[/img]


Now plug in your phone and put it anywhere on your sdcard, I put it in the root.

2.	Now we are going to need some VNC software for our PC so that the two can communicate together, for the sake of the tutorial i am going to recommend  TIGHTVNC as it is free and reliable, feel free to use your own however. Download and install TIGHTVNC from here –

[url=http://www.tightvnc.com/]http://www.tightvnc.com/[/url]
[url=http://www.tightvnc.com/download.html]http://www.tightvnc.com/download.html[/url]

3.	Ok now we have all the software we need its time to install it. Using a file viewer/manager such as ‘ASTRO’ which is available in the g1 marketplace locate the android VNC viewer we put on our sdcard and install it. One install go to your applications list and it should be near the top a little application called ‘andriodVNC’. Open it up and a screen like this should appear –

Go to your computer and go to Start-&gt; Run then type ‘cmd’ and click enter. Once in the command prompt type ‘Netstat’ and click enter.  Some text about your network status will come up, leave that window open.

4.	Now run the TightVNC server that we installed and set a password as-well as any other settings you want

Click ‘Apply’ and leave TIGHTVNC running.

5.	Final Step, go back to you G1 and in the ‘AndriodVnc’ application type in the password that you set in the TightVNC server, then on your PC referring to the netstat command type in your address and a valid port, the most common port is 5900. Your settings should be something like this –
Nickname – Crackmunky
Password - *****
Address -  192.168.1.6
Port – 5900
Color Format – whatever you want, high quality colours take much longer to load.

Then click ‘Connect’ and you should almost instantly  get connected to your remote desktop!
There is various scaling and movement options, as-well as colours ect ect. It takes some time to find the right type of movement for you. Good Luck and hope this helps.
