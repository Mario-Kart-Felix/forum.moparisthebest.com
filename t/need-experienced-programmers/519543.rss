    <description>[center]Hey guys, I&#39;m andrew I&#39;m 13 and I wish to start a development team with around 4-6 guys max. What I had in mind was 1 guy is the GFX designer, one guy designs the website and the rest are server sided programmers. What this server is, is a 377 old school blank source and client. Freshly downloaded last night. I had an idea about having a little &quot;Project&quot;, and wished to start one since I am a fresh new Java learner, and I just finished a 2,000 page book on Java last night.

Some things about me - 
- Mild Java experience, due to me studying Java via books on my kindle for about... 6 months
- I act older than I am
- My skype is Minnesnowta.ftw
- I DO have R.S.P.S programming experience
- I cooperate well with ideas and other programmers
                                                                          



Here is my vision of the server/client sided team - 
- 2 People would be the main developers
- 1 Person would be like items and NPC programmers
- 1 person would be maybe shops, minigames, quests?


Please don&#39;t be intimidated by my age, I know i&#39;m 13 but I act more like a young adult.


 If you would like to apply for any of those positions please use the formats that I&#39;ll give to you in a second.

<p>I suggest you just start developing stuff for your server first and then ask people to join you. If you want that big team it’s highly recommended that all of you know at least some java.</p>

Yet you don't make your own framework.
<blockquote>- 1 Person would be like items and NPC programmers</blockquote>
So, a modeler. That's client sided. Unless you mean changing strengths and weaknesses of NPC's, which is just changing a few variables and could barely be considered programming.
<blockquote>- 1 person would be maybe shops, minigames, quests?</blockquote>
Changing a few numbers falls under the categories of shops. I suppose that having a team for questing and minigames would be decent setup.
<p>Good luck. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
