If the server was written in pure java then people would need to simply have a staging environment to test in before placing the plugins in the production environment and triggering a server update and restart.</p>
<p>With that said though, how does ruby perform? I don’t know if you remember the interest in the Rhino javascript engine, but it was horrendously slow.</p>

        <p>It’s jRuby which is supposedly fast, but like you said I don’t think speed is really the issue here when we’re dealing with a few hundred players (or 2k max, whatever). In that case it comes down more to how the core is designed than how the plugins use that core (unless the plugin is really horrible, but that could be the case with a Ruby plugin as well). The main thing I don’t want to have to deal with is having content that relies on editing many files and having to do that manually. But if the server is open source anyways, git should be able to take care of that.</p>
<p>All of that said, having a nice and easy hook class for java plugins would still be useful for developers, and even without dynamic loading might simplify the whole process.</p>

        <p>I don’t see Ruby as a high barrier of entry for people to develop content. The reason I didn’t use Java plugins is because its a pain in the ass to compile them each time they are updated, also to note you would have to make a class for each handler you needed to bind and that could potentially be hundreds of classes for all the plugins we would need to make. The current system does it better, and I really don’t want to shift that direction unless I am instructed by MITB/another leader that he has an interest in adding other options considering it would move away from the current model of how everything is set up. I never had it in my sights to do such a change so the server is not prepared to be hacked back in such a manner to accommodate that change.</p>
<p>The dynamic loading helps with development considering there are tiny changes you have to constantly make to a script and recompiling/launching the server each time is a pain.</p>
<p>Again, I don’t think we should shift to a java plugin system. I think I can help instruct people simple ways to develop in Ruby, since I honestly dont consider myself good at Ruby and I don’t think its that hard to pickup.</p>

<p>EDIT - I see what you mean now, but I don’t see the big deal… I’m pretty sure creating an instance of a class in Jruby vs creating one with a .class file isn’t any different in terms of ram usage or anything like that, so what’s the issue?</p>
<p>I think as long as it’s organized nicely, it really shouldn’t matter</p>

<p>It would require a completely different system than say using the scripting system in place now where the ScriptEngine can be exchanged for a different language. I don’t want to move away from scripting, and I don’t think having two plugin systems is very smart. Also bundling them together sounds hacky.</p>
<p>I also noted the amount of classes that a java plugin system would require, it’d be an ugly mess. Scripting is the route to go, I am very adamant about that.</p>
<p>However, if every agrees that it would be a good addition than I would love to draw plans up on how to move forward with the idea.</p>

        <p>Speed isn’t an issue in the sense that it should forever be the number one priority, but I’m saying to be wary in coming to a decision so that you don’t cripple the software’s potential right from the outset.</p>
<p>Stick with a scripting engine (the sensible choice), but consider evaluating a few first before making a final decision. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:129, topic:443579”]Well frankly I don’t see why you would go with the hybrid mix as far as content goes. Keep the core pure java, keep the content ruby.[/quote]Well I’ll just turn around and use ‘why not’, in terms of letting people use either pure ruby to write a skill or java</p>
<p>I’ll give some pseudo code to demonstrate what I mean…</p>
<p>If you were to write a skill in pure Ruby, you’d have something like this in the current system:</p>
<p><code>
RuneEmulator::Bootstrap.bind_object_option(Option::ONE) { |player, object, option, context|
	if option.eql?('chop-down')
		Woodcutting::chop_down( args shit)
	end
}</code></p>
<p><code>
#woodcutting.rb
module RuneEmulator
	class Woodcutting
		class &lt;&lt; self
			def chop_down( args shit)
				#chop a tree
			end
		end
	end
end</code></p>
<p>my idea is ALLOW (I say allow because this requires no modification of the current plugin system or core) them to do this instead of they wish:</p>
<p>[code=ruby]<br>
java_import ‘net.scapeemulator.game.model.player.skills.Woodcutting’</p>
<p>RuneEmulator::Bootstrap.bind_object_option(Option::ONE) { |player, object, option, context|<br>
if option.eql?(‘chop-down’)<br>
Woodcutting::chopDown( args shit)<br>
end<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p><code>
public class Woodcutting {
     public void chopDown(args shit) {
        //chop a tree
     }
}</code>Now obviously this may be something else like GameServer.getSkillHandlers().getWoodcutting().chopDown() or Player.getWoodcutting().chopDown() vs having a static method, that’s irrelevant and easy to change in either case, I honestly don’t know how you’d want to do that. But yea, that’s just what I think the easiest way to handle it would be in terms of letting average people develop but also taking full advantage of Ruby when it comes to the handlers and such.</p>
<p>EDIT - And again I <span class="bbcode-i">am</span> aware that using pure ruby for the whole thing is more elegant, but I don’t see any important disadvantages to allowing the use of java in content development that would outweigh the advantage of being a lot more accessible to the community</p>

        <p>I dont like that at all</p>
<p>I dont think you understand in the design I am trying to separate the function of responsibility because it tends to make the purpose of the hierarchy a bit murky. GameServer shouldnt hold any information about the game service, the purpose of the game server is to hold information about the subservices that the game service manages.</p>
<p>We need to keep the design intact and there are rules of what we cannot and can edit/append to specific classes.</p>
<p>It’s a compromise but like Lothy said, I think we need to separate the core to just be java and the content to just be Ruby (and some Java for CERTAIN things like the way I created a handler for picking up ground items).</p>
<p>The plugin system is misnamed, the system is just an organizational structure to execute scripts which use a common bootstrap to apply code to the server to make certain content functions work. I had originally made it so that there was a plugin interface (onLoad, onUnload methods, etc) but I found it a bit excessive with the approach I was taking.</p>
<p>MITB posted in the IRC about this so I wanted to just clarify that.</p>

        <p>I specifically said that the Woodcutting class could be anywhere hoping you wouldn’t bring that part up, was just an example and I have no idea where it would actually end up</p>
<p>Lothy came back into the IRC and said something else that I was a bit too busy to try and understand (I think it was something more behind the scenes about how you had your handlers set up and not the actual scripts?), but I still don’t see what the reasoning is behind not allowing Java, it seems like a much more pragmatic approach even if it doesn’t fit exactly into the idea of a perfect server. I’d much rather compromise a bit of theoretical cleanliness than the extra time it would take for either a) people to learn ruby or b) less people writing content</p>
<p>And ya know, if people learn ruby in the process, content can start to be converted to ruby from java as the process continues anyways if it really is that important.</p>

        <p>Are we planning to let people just make changes at will? I’m sure there needs to be some quality control.</p>
<p>I don’t honestly think people will be writing skills, I think that will be something we do. I think people will be writing quests/areas.</p>
<p>Heres my honest philosophy with how I perceive the community server to function. I believe that there should be a consistent quality that we hold to when people develop content to be added to the live server. We can’t just let anyone develop features for the server, it’s just not plausible. There needs to be loose guidelines on basic expectations.</p>
<p>People however are welcome to download, edit, and host the source assuming that its open source. They can code whatever they like, in whatever fashion they want. I think there is a limited liberty people have when this is going to be a publicly hosted server, considering we obviously want to keep a high standard of quality to get people interested in using the source.</p>
<p>Also I think you are still exaggerating the entry barrier of learning how to script in Ruby.</p>

        <p>We’ve dragged this argument out at least a page or two, I’m going to close and say I don’t think the learning curve is that heavy, given its Ruby. Its not nearly as complex as Java. Also note, I don’t think you are in touch with design standards because the suggestions you made with your compromise are very iffy. Originally there was no singleton instance of the GameServer class, I had to change that to accommodate the dynamic plugin reloading. I was very hesitant on that for a number of reasons, one being that it leads to a slippery slope of design proposals such as the one where you suggest we hold classes that contain logic for skills on the instance of the GameServer.</p>
<p>I don’t see there to be a valid compromise in the cards and honestly Lothy has even stated an opinion about how:</p>
<blockquote>I don't see why you would go with the hybrid mix as far as content goes.</blockquote>
<p>I bet other people would agree. It just seems very odd, and a bit hacky.</p>
<p>No matter what there is an entry barrier for people adding content. I hope that we don’t let just anyone add any sort of content to the live server at will. That would be catastrophic especially given that our standard of quality is not very high. People have a trouble grasping java, but I don’t think you are too familiar with many scripting languages if you think that learning a scripting language is harder than learning a language like Java. Of course its a different median, but it’s a language that if I had the opportunity of telling someone my opinion of having them learn it before Java I would do so.</p>
<p>The word tagged to ‘community’ server can be perceived in many ways. I think this is a good resolution to defining what we mean by that. I think we can conclude it does not mean that we have made a server that everyone has the right to develop on, but we are making a server that everyone has the opportunity to develop on given they meet a certain criteria when they submit their work.</p>
<p>If they fork the project when its at its peak and then make skills in java, great. Power to them. But I think we should uphold the standard where skills, dialogues, quests, and other major pieces should be scripted. Just for the sake of being smart about development.</p>
<p>But anyway. We need to move forward with other pressing issues.</p>

        <p>Sick of you mentioning me being out of touch with those design standards to be honest (the plugin reloading I had, my code example with where the woodcutting class would be) when everything you’ve mentioned I stated multiple times was completely random and not to be taken as an actual design concept, especially as they are irrelevant to the plugins themselves which is what this is about. So can we drop that part of it and not take my pseudo code as a real example please?</p>
<p>And I can answer Lothy’s opinion/question: you would go for a hybrid because it makes it more accessible without really sacrificing anything in terms of speed and such. It’s that simple of an answer, really. (Also worthwhile to note that the hybrid he is talking about was before I even elaborated on what I meant)</p>
<p>Never once did I also say that learning a scripting language is harder than learning a language like Java, I was merely pointing out that the majority of the community will be somewhat experienced with the concepts of Java where they may have never even seen Ruby scripting (or any scripting for that matter) before. That’s quite a big jump. And I think the idea behind community server is that anyone can push an update, and then it is reviewed and potentially accepted. By limiting it to Ruby you not only limit the overall number of submitters, you limit the number of ‘judges’ as well slowing the entire process down.</p>
<p>What other pressing issues?</p>

 I like that there is scripting though, and ruby is as good of a choice than any[/quote]</p>
<p>let’s not read more into that than what he actually says <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>ALSO: Ok so there’s a small quarrel going on between myself and sinisoul about content development. He wants <span class="bbcode-b">ALL</span> content to be scripted with ruby through his plugin system (which does have clear advantages, such as being able to reload live), but I think that’s unrealistic when it comes to a community server. We’ve always been mainly about Java here, and requiring that people learn another language when they may not even be excellent at Java yet would really turn a lot of people off. I personally have a lot of drive to develop this server but I don’t have the drive to try and get good with Ruby, especially with college starting again on Monday.</p>
<p>The way I see it, we have 3 options when it comes to content development:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stick to 100% ruby plugins</li>
<li>Add a java plugin option, hopefully with a way to allow us to compile and reload them in a similar way the ruby scripts work. Bukkit has a system like that and I’m sure it’s not too complex. Still have ruby plugins.</li>
<li>Allow addition of content to the actual server core AND plugins (ruby and maybe java)[/quote]</li>
</ol>
<p>stick to one language for plugins. i just think something like lua would be a lot more appropriate for a scripting environment.</p>

<p>I was merely pointing out that the majority of the community will be somewhat experienced with the concepts of Java</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>To be honest, the majority of the community is (sadly) only familiar with copying and pasting from tutorials. Anyone who does actually know how to program Java shouldn’t have many problems picking up a scripting language, whether it’s Ruby or something else.</p>
<p>btw sini: the LICENSE file from scapeemu seems to have not been included in the server you released that is based on it, I’d appreciate it if you could include it in the download (technically you have to do so although I’m not going to be strict about it).</p>

<p>Theifmn, would you like to provide an example of how that would be done? I’m interested in seeing your idea.</p>
