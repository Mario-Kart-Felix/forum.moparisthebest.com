To say the truth some guy wanted to scam me $25 by saying he fixed this source to near perfection [url=http://uppit.com/vdps6agaxdzc/Demolitionx.rar]http://uppit.com/vdps6agaxdzc/Demolitionx.rar
[/url] it is demolitionx... I downloaded it and tried to remove the anti leech, but I, newer to 667s dont know fully what to do... Im asking you guys to lend a hand to help me not get scammed by helping me or fixing the anti leech so i can check it out and compare it to the supposed &quot;fixed version&quot;
