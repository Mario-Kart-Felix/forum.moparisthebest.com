    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;The last abortionist

Warren Hern is no ordinary doctor. He has lived under siege for 25 years, and seen eight of his colleagues assassinated. Even some of his own patients want him dead. John H Richardson meets the last late-term abortionist in America&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The young couple flew into Wichita bearing, in the lovely swell of the wife&#39;s belly, a burden of grief. They came from a religious tradition where large families are celebrated and they wanted this baby, and it was very late in her pregnancy. But the doctors recommended abortion. They said that with her complications, there were only two men skilled enough to pull it off. One was George Tiller, a Wichita doctor who specialised in late abortions.

They arrived on Sunday, 31 May last year. As they drove to their hotel, a Holiday Inn just two blocks from the Reformation Lutheran Church, they saw television cameras. They wondered what was going on, a passing curiosity quickly forgotten. But when they got to their room, the phone was ringing. Her father was on the line. &quot;There was some doctor who was shot who does abortions,&quot; he said. They turned on CNN. Dr Tiller had just been killed, shot in the head as he passed out church leaflets.

Now there is only one doctor left.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;People don&#39;t get it,&quot; he says. &quot;After eight murders, 17 attempted murders, 406 death threats, 179 assaults, and four kidnappings, people are still in denial. They say, &#39;Well, this was just some wingnut guy who just decided to go blow up somebody.&#39; Wrong. This was a cold-blooded, brutal, political assassination that is the logical consequence of 35 years of hate speech and incitement to violence by people from the highest levels of American society, including but in no way limited to George Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jesse Helms, Bill O&#39;Reilly, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. Reagan may not have been a fascist, but he was a tool of the fascists. Bush was most certainly a tool of the fascists. They use this issue to get power. They seem civilised, but underneath you have this seething mass of rabid anger and hatred of freedom that is really frightening, and they support people like the guy who shot George – they&#39;re all pretending to be upset, issuing statements about how much they deplore violence, but it&#39;s just bullshit. This is exactly what they wanted to happen.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>I think you’ve missed the point about a placenta. Both the embryo and placenta develop from the same fertilised egg. After the sperm goes into the egg, it divides a few times then one part becomes the placenta and the other the embryo. It blows the argument of “sperm + egg = life” out of the water.</p>
<p>If you continue to apply the label ‘human’ to all these things and use it to justify your stance, you will cause much suffering to people. I don’t see how you can put the non-suffering of an embryo younger then about 28 weeks before the great suffering of the unfortunate woman, her friends, family and entire society.</p>

              <p>[quote=“yakman, post:30, topic:327030”]When a sperm fertilises an egg they produce a placenta along with an embryo. This placenta is genetically identical to the embryo but it dies when the embryo becomes a baby and is born. If you believe that fertilisation produces life then logically you must treat the placenta as a living thing, try to protect it or at very least, hold a funeral over its dead body.</p>
<p>Arguing that all human cells need protecting would stop you helping as cancer patient, as cancer cells are human cells too, surely destroying them is murder.</p>
<p>The only way to try to rebutt these is to point out the <span class="bbcode-i">potential</span> of an embryo to develop into a baby, while placentas and cancer will never become people. This is logically inconsistent because if a girl refused you sex, you could say she was a murderer that halted the potential of a new person.</p>
<p>We in the secular morality camp don’t protect cells, we protect <span class="bbcode-i">people</span>. People can feel physical and emotional pain. They can suffer. We don’t protect cancers, placentas or embryos younger then roughly 28 weeks because they cannot suffer. We know this because they don’t have proper nervous systems.[/quote]</p>

<p>When the “Moral relativism” of allowing abortion to occur is decried as inhumane and the sanctity of human life is invoked, it is usually in a self-defeating hypocritical context. In reality making moral decisions is not as simple as knowing what is good and knowing what is bad and then doing the good things and not doing the bad things. Our actions have consequences beyond those which are easily foreseen. In truth making a truly moral decision involves considering our duty not only to the potential human life we see in the birth of a new child, but our duty to ourselves and the whole world.</p>
<p>The “Pro-Lifers” say murder is always bad and abortion is murder. Blindly following consumer culture is murder, from the child slaves sewing the shirts which stock shopping malls to the Mexican drug lords processing the cocaine for the politicians, the ruination of human life and murder itself is a necessary step in the supply chain. Ronald McDonald is child murderer. People die from eating that McDonald’s shit, seriously. Those who emphasize that success is synonymous with wealth and revel in the joy of purchasing ever more expensive and complicated time-saving devices are often times Pro-Lifers. “In transportation, food, and water, we are using resources faster than they are replenished. As the population is increasing, the resources available are decreasing.” (<a href="http://schutt.org/blog/2009/04/population-growth/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Source</a>)</p>
<p>How can I say abortion is bad? In some cases it may be necessary, to save the life of the mother.</p>
<p>How can I say murder is bad? If you are forced to defend a child from getting murdered and your only option is to murder his potential assailant,  it’s difficult to advocate a policy of nonviolence.</p>
<p>You can’t divide everything into bad and good. Simple dualism is attractive to those who are attracted to simplicity. It’s easy to take a stand on abortion without thinking to deeply about it. However if you really look at a Yin-Yang, you notice that dualism isn’t simple. There can’t be good without bad, there can’t be bad without good. Abortion can be, as Martha Stewart says (though never in this context), a good thing.</p>

              <p>ultimate conclusion: That article was extremely biased. It pretends to be an objective news story, but amounts to nothing more than left-wing propaganda.* Something it also fails to realize is that in taking away someones’ freedom to have an abortion, you are granting a human being the freedom to live.</p>
<p>And about the murder thing:<br>
Society in general does discriminate between killing a person and other beings. That’s why we allow things such as hunting. Society does not allow the killing of human beings. So it’s a little strange to me when a human being is allowed to be killed when it is still in the womb. At which point does the embryo develop into a human being? At birth? When it “gets a penis?” My point being that those lines are all arbitrary. So how about disallowing abortion? Problem solved, no human beings are lawfully killed regardless of definition, and the “right to have an abortion” lost is no greater than the “right to murder.”</p>
<p>And to say that the only argument to stop abortion comes from religion is stupid. I regard myself as nonreligious and a religious skeptic at best, and I disagree with abortion.  In fact, to be so condescending and hateful to religion is almost antithetical to the reason a lot of people get fed up and disgusted with religion in the first place (e.g. religious wars, intolerance, etc.)</p>

many pregnancies end in natural abortion before the mother even knows<br>
placenta is clone of embryo</p>
<p>When a sperm fertilises an egg they produce a placenta along with an embryo. This placenta is genetically identical to the embryo but it dies when the embryo becomes a baby and is born. If you believe that fertilisation produces life then logically you must treat the placenta as a living thing, try to protect it or at very least, hold a funeral over its dead body.</p>
<p>Arguing that all human cells need protecting would stop you helping as cancer patient, as cancer cells are human cells too, surely destroying them is murder.</p>
<p>The only way to try to rebutt these is to point out the <span class="bbcode-i">potential</span> of an embryo to develop into a baby, while placentas and cancer will never become people. This is logically inconsistent because if a girl refused you sex, you could say she was a murderer that halted the potential of a new person.</p>
<p>We in the secular morality camp don’t protect cells, we protect <span class="bbcode-i">people</span>. People can feel physical and emotional pain. They can suffer. We don’t protect cancers, placentas or embryos younger then roughly 28 weeks because they cannot suffer. We know this because they don’t have proper nervous systems.[/quote]<br>
You can’t lose something that you don’t already have. With that said, your little spiel about thinking someone a murder for not having sex with you is ridiculous. I don’t know whether you were going for that or not, but it was a stupid thing to even consider writing.</p>
<p>I do agree with your definition of human though. I myself believe that the being must be sentient before it can be considered human.</p>

<p>Intelligence and the labels of right and wrong are 2 things out of a huge number of properties that you could judge life by. (If we should even be judging a life) We fuck up the world more than other animals, even though we’re so much smarter.</p>
<p>Right and wrong are just a human invention, and they are not universal, even amongst other humans. They are meaningless if you look at the big picture, and I don’t see how being more intelligent makes us more important.</p>
<p>Even if these 2 random properties are more important for some reason, why should it stop at race? Going by that a professor deserves to live more than a random idiot.</p>

<p>No, I am saying killing a living human ‘thing’ is murder.  Once the sperm and egg join inside a human female, they form a HUMAN cell that is living.  At that point it is human, and killing it on purpose is murder.</p>
