    <title>MySQL Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mysql-question/253974</link>
    <description>Hello, what I&#39;m trying to do is make a Single instance of MySQLManager, my class that handles all MySQL communications. But i want to make every other class in my server, quests, skills, diaries, etc, be able to use the MySQLManager Class, without creating another instance of the MySQLManager class. Would i just have each of those classes extend to MySQLManager? or would i have to do something else?</description>
