    <title>Adding holy books?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-holy-books/287411</link>
    <description>I made a quest on my server that gives you a damaged book. Problem is, I have no idea to make it require all 4 different pages of that book to turn into a holy book. I&#39;m thinking this would have to do with public int&#39;s? Or am I wrong. Anyways thanks to anyone who helps.</description>
