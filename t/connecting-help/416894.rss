    <description>Hi Moparscapers.

Recently I decided to use my extremely old computer as a hosting computer for my server. It&#39;s windows 2000 (ooooh yeaah  ;))
Anyway. I&#39;ve Port forwarded corretly, duc is running and I have a host active. My server files are on the hosting computer and it even runs the source.
Any Idea&#39;s as to why I can&#39;t connect to it on my normal computer?

(there is no problem with the internet, like it has good enough upload speed for 30-40 players)
Any help would be appreciated.</description>
