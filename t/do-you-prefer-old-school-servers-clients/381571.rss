    <title>Do you prefer old school servers/clients?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-you-prefer-old-school-servers-clients/381571</link>
    <description>Hey everyone. Recently I found an amazing old school server/client that was like a replica of RuneScape, and it wasn&#39;t All-Star based! It has a client that comes with it, but I might as well just use moparscape or Silab client to play it. But the thing is, I&#39;m afraid that most people are tired of old school servers now. I don&#39;t want to make a server that will get very little to no players. Here&#39;s what it looks like:

(I personally love servers and clients like this! I nostalgia hardcore whenever I play on one of these)</description>

I cannot stand the content within sources such as DSPK, and I’ve seen that my old server has turned into a DSPK source as well [I sold my Uncalled Attack project to someone].</p>

              <p>I loved the old servers like Pimpscape and Cheezescape 80. These were the basic building blocks of RSPS and were the most fun to see be developed. My next favorite would be the “Czar bases”. The new servers are pretty much all the same, so unless you are really going to put your imagination into it, don’t bother with them.</p>

<p>I bet there are a bunch of old players who like the newer ones.</p>
<p>I started RSPS a while ago, but stopped playing all types of RuneScapes. At that time I liked the oldest type of server possible. Now I like the newer ones (1+ years later).</p>

              <p>I don’t like the Gameframe, because, well, I think it is ugly.  But that’s just my opinion, and I probably don’t like it because I never played RuneScape back then, I just watched my older brother play. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Hey everyone. Recently I found an amazing old school server/client that was like a replica of RuneScape, and it wasn’t All-Star based! It has a client that comes with it, but I might as well just use moparscape or Silab client to play it. But the thing is, I’m afraid that most people are tired of old school servers now. I don’t want to make a server that will get very little to no players. Here’s what it looks like:<br>

(I personally love servers and clients like this! I nostalgia hardcore whenever I play on one of these)</p>
