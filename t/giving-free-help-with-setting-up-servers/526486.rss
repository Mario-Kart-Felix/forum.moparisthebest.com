    <description>Helping people with setting up server for free, add me on skype taivo.grossberg1 .
Also i can help people with 667 zenith sources.
Ive notived that theres not so many good guides out there, so since im done with rsps&#39;s i could aswell help out people who are planning to make their own server (port forwarding, help with vps, errors, first server,explaining java etc.). 

Dear Haters,
I might be a noob but im atleast doing something for the rsps community.</description>
