    <description>Thanks to Flame for the idea of creating a text-based society.

I plan on going pretty in depth with this project to get the hang of java&#39;s packaging system and the overall reason to grasp the language a bit better. I&#39;m trying to start off pretty organized, so I created quite a bit of packages and classes. I was going to put my main method in the Extremity class. When this program is initialized, I want it to have a list of facts, based on the data that I put into the class files, that update every minute. 
In the future, I want this program to somehow &#39;run behind the scenes&#39; so it can accumulate overtime and see how my economy ends up!

Here&#39;s the packaging system I&#39;v come up with.

**and yes, I know I spelled Birth rate wrong, it has already been changed.

If you have any ideas on a better way to organize, or even some general tips you would like to share, feel free to let me know! Thank you.</description>

I agree, but at least this provides ground for him to rework his design.</p>

Or you could simply just create a variable in the animal’s class which indicates certain properties of the animal: biomes, aggression, product, etc.</p>
