    <description>After downloading project purple i ran it, the first time it ran fine. the second time i had an egui error after that i just thought it was a client error so i tried playing my other client, it said java not found and i was like wtf, so i tried directing it to my java path, said not found, by now i was wondering, i decided to play runescape, and it said java not found, i went to download it again and it did its thing, reinstalled, after that i went back to runescape and it still said no java, i kept trying to fix my client, and then i realized it all started when i ran project purple for the second time, now im not directly blaming them, but if they do know anything about this or it has happened to anyone i would like to know wtf is going on</description>
