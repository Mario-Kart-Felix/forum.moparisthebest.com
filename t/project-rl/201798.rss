    <description>     First off, I&#39;d like to point out why it&#39;s says &quot;RL&quot; instead of the actual name, well, that&#39;s because I don&#39;t want someone taking it before we get done with ours :P. Now, to get down to business.

     [b]The History Behind It All:[/b] Project RL was born on April 14, 2008. I, myself, started this task and realized I needed another partner, I alone could not handle this major task I so hardenly set out to do. I asked my friend, Will, (who has been programming in Java for more than three years now) if he&#39;d help me and he gladly accepted. Have you ever sat there on your computer, wanting, wishing, hoping someone would come along and make a great source? Well, your dreaming has finally payed off. I&#39;ve played Runescape Private Servers long enough to know that most(not all!) are crap. Plagiarized or not coded very well, I got tired of actually find a &quot;good&quot; server and it only be up for two days and it somehow be off forever. I got sick of it so much, I decided to create my own server. With my bud Will.

     We are not accepting any applications for other people because we only can trust each other, apparently, some people can&#39;t take the fact that when they are mad, they release someone&#39;s hard work, so, with that said, NO! Applications are open :D. Sorry guys, just thought you all might wanna know how it&#39;s going. I will continue to Update this when we get something done.

    Oh! If I forgot anything or need to add anything to make this better! Please! Tell me :D</description>
