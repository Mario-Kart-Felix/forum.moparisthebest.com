RuneAzura 718 is a brand new addition too the RuneAzura team. We currently have two servers as of last week, RuneAzura 317 was our original project and has been up for just under a year, with continuous updates. The RuneAzura team slowly came too the conclusion, &quot;why not expand our services for the majority of Rsps players?&quot; Therefore, we thought a great 718 would do just the trick bringing out all the new 718 features and content that we can not explore on the 317. [/center]

[*]Amazing 718 HD and full screen compatability.
[*]Easy navigation with a user friendly teleports.
[*]10+ Bosses with strong Economic Drop Rates, Teaming bosses is available!
[*]Lots to do - You will never get bored with on-going boss &quot;contracts&quot; and a Prestige system!
[*]Four levels of difficulty - Super Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard and Extreme.
[*]Unique Donator and Server ranks - V.I.P Donator, Legendary Donator, Ultimate Donator, GFX Designer and Server Helper.
[*]Unique Polypore and Jadikino lairs.
[*]Fully Working QBD.
[*]Flawless Matrix Switching.
[*]Great economic PVM with realistic drop rates.
[*]Fully working dungeoneering - Easy, Medium, High and [New] Daemonheim.

              <p>Amazing server with a very active community. Ever since my first day with RuneAzura on the 317, Brad and Dylan have released so much content it was unbelievable. Now, they have this 718 as well as the 317, and they are still uploading amazing content on both at the same time. RuneAzura is an amazing server.</p>

              <p>very fun and exciting server. 1st day blew my mind away. Been with them for months now and well it just gets better. i vouch for this server and highly suggest you to give it a try.Has lots of great features and customs. <em>not too much tho</em> But still worth trying. Some actually learn new things they could not try on the 317. So go ahead! hope to see you all ingame!     <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
