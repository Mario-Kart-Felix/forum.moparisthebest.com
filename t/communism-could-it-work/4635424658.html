<p>Greed is definitely in human nature. There is no case of a person who is simply ‘happy’ with everything they have. No, people always want more.</p>

<p>This is not true at all, I personally know many who are happy with what they have, which is basically the minimum they need to survive.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because those people choose to sit on their asses. Same reason why my neighbor has been living in the apartment for 16 years, because they live off the minimum. This system allows people who are greedy to take advantage and earn hundreds of millions by screwing people over. The person who is being screwed over is in fact the person who is happy with their everyday life.</p>

<p>I know people who live life on the minimum yet go around doing anonymous good deeds and charity. I don’t think they’re bums, at least not to me.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m going to assume when you say “people who live life on the minimum” you are referring to minimum wage and that you aren’t just making a convoluted rant about welfare</p>
<p>in which case, no, they are not ‘not’ contributing to society, society in fact needs these people, I’m sure you’ve heard the argument before and are going to dismiss it because of that but think about it for a minute, without the thousands and hundreds of thousands of people in the bottom of the barrel literally doing jobs you wouldn’t want to do, you wouldn’t be here now</p>
<p>not everyone can be doctors, engineers, mathematicians etc and not everyone can work to be one just by ‘working hard’, there is an excess of people for a lack of jobs and assuming there wasn’t a lack of jobs those jobs would be meaningless without ‘lesser’ jobs to support them, can’t have a doctor without construction workers to build the hospital, janitors to keep the hospital clean, people to lay the electrics water gas communication cables etc etc and to repair and maintain everything</p>

</aside>
<p>This this this this. I believe that communism is a great idea that everyone shares their wealth and whatnot, but it will never work until we fix the ethics in society. Everything in society is taught it is about me me me and not everyone else. A lot of times people only see the small picture and fail to see everything working together. A lot of businesses have moved to the ideology that if I lay off 500 workers and pay my workers 5 cents less and make 10000 more products then I will make 10 million more dollars rather than looking out for their workers and employees. I believe once we solve these sorts of problems in society, then communism might work. Although that would be the day, wouldn’t it? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <p>I should be serious from now on. The wikipedia definition doesn’t contradict what I said at all.</p>
<p>I don’t have GOP’s definition of socialism:</p>
<p>Socialism (səʊʃəlɪz(ə)m) noun: Stuff you don’t like.</p>
<p>EDIT: Read a bit longer down on the site:<br>
The exact definition of communism varies, and it is often mistakenly, in general political discourse, used interchangeably with socialism; however, Marxist theory contends that socialism is just a transitional stage on the road to communism.</p>

… people who live life on the minimum are bums. They are either too lazy or incapable of contributing positively or  negatively to society.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m going to assume when you say “people who live life on the minimum” you are referring to minimum wage and that you aren’t just making a convoluted rant about welfare</p>
<p>in which case, no, they are not ‘not’ contributing to society, society in fact needs these people, I’m sure you’ve heard the argument before and are going to dismiss it because of that but think about it for a minute, without the thousands and hundreds of thousands of people in the bottom of the barrel literally doing jobs you wouldn’t want to do, you wouldn’t be here now</p>
<p>not everyone can be doctors, engineers, mathematicians etc and not everyone can work to be one just by ‘working hard’, there is an excess of people for a lack of jobs and assuming there wasn’t a lack of jobs those jobs would be meaningless without ‘lesser’ jobs to support them, can’t have a doctor without construction workers to build the hospital, janitors to keep the hospital clean, people to lay the electrics water gas communication cables etc etc and to repair and maintain everything[/quote]</p>
<p>Why should one job rely on another? My family has a company and we built the building from the ground up. From complications as water and electrical to simple stuff as walls and a roof. The reason we are still in business is because we maintain things ourselves. We maintain all of our machinery, which is 56 years old and the reason it lasted that long is because we maintained it. We don’t have a janitor as we clean everything ourselves. Yes there is electric and water which we don’t produce ourselves (well we could the water since it rains 9 months out of the year, hell even the electric) but we pay our bills and somewhat rely on the company in charge of these things do their jobs correctly.</p>
<p>I could name off jobs left and right about what we don’t need (especially here in America) and where they should be. I support communism because it gets the job done. With the right goals in place this country can be in a hell of a lot better situation, but let’s let those average Americans who are in no way contributing to society, since their jobs are meaningless continue their hard work.</p>

        <p>re: socialism being a political system; by calling communism a political system you are glossing over some serious nuance, the wikipedia link you quoted from even explains it as a “social, political and economic ideology” and as far as I’m aware socialism isn’t necessarily ‘communism’ without the political agenda, and that doesn’t address the issue of things like oh, state socialism</p>
<p>now if you’ll excuse me a path of exile race is about to start and I’m taking part, I’ll come back and explain more in 3 hours</p>

Janitors are actually not usually for messes, but more sanitation. Also, if anyone pukes, they are usually too sick to clean it up. A janitor isn’t afraid, hence, he gets the job because no one else wants to do it. He’s happy, we’re happy. Capitalism.</p>

<p>Eh let’s say the janitor we speak of works at a school. Elementary, to be more specific. He washes the windows, the floors, the bathrooms (probably the most important), or in some cases puke if a kid throws up, and maybe science projects. Sanitation, ill give you that, but if everyone put it in their own mind to be clean we wouldn’t have this issue. The janitor happy? A few now and again, but they usually in most cases are unhappy. Especially if they are not getting benefits and can’t get a better job (like my janitor from elementary school) Do we absolutely require a Janitor? No. Do we need to pay a janitor 8 hours for 3 hours of work? No.</p>

<p>I have traveled the world, unfortunately with my own money and not some companies. Well most of the money came from stocks. Traveling the world gave me an insight on how pathetic America is. Let’s put some people to work, real work and create a better system to prevent things, rather than to fix the same continuous issue as it arises. You may believe I don’t know much of the matter but I can argue that economics is truly simple. It’s cause and effect. Point a to point b. No need to make things complicated, like our government.</p>

<p>Which would relate to a nurses job. (Family member is a nurse and does the cleaning) The nurses also have better things to do onto of their usual maintenance. Such as paperwork. And you could say something along the lines of a nurse not cleaning floors, well than the person at the front desk greeting people can be a part time janitor. I am not saying the job isn’t important, I am saying one person for that job is fucking ridiculous.<br>
Do you believe doctors/nurses should be paid for a procedure, or after the patient is healed/fixed/better etc?</p>

</aside>
<p>Even if we don’t require a janitor, capitalism and the free market allow him to exist. We aren’t complaining, he’s getting paid, so he stays. Simple as that. You can’t question whether he’s needed or not, because he would already be gone if he wasn’t needed.</p>
