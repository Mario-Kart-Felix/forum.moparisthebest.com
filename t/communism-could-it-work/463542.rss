    <title>Communism - could it work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/communism-could-it-work/463542</link>
    <description>As we have seen throughout history, particularly in the past century, communism has flopped in any attempt to put it into a working government with humans as the pawns. This is rather unfortunate, because I do in fact believe that, with the right guidelines, a completely system of communism that relies completely on the balances of others could work in order to create a stabilized economy along with the removal of any existing central government and instead place that into individual powers that would be in complete alliance to manage individual areas of a nation.

The most common counter to communism is that human greed throws the system, and, by the end, a socialistic system is created where a single man is given all the power, the people are unhappy, and rebellion/uprisings become present. So tell me, Mopar, what are your opinions on this &#39;radical&#39; (frowned upon) style of government? Do you think that it could work on more than paper, or maybe in smaller sects? Could a successful society overpower the human greed that is created by it? Or maybe it&#39;s something that&#39;s so ridiculous, you would never be in favor for the people should have an opinion and the majority of them aren&#39;t completely blowhards.

<p>Do Niall really need to write anything to own people now. Can’t he just declare his presence and win the argument?</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the story is that it is no a valid argument, even if it was true. There is lots of examples where people pay into a shared stockpile without problems. We all pay taxes for healthcare. (Unless you’re an American or do not live in an industrialized country). We share the cost of roads, bridges, farm subsidies to secure the county’s food production. And we all ripe the benefits. It is not socialism, but it sure is similar to the story HcoJustin told us.</p>

<p>Well done, you’re wrong on just about everything.</p>
<p>The pilgrims (in Plymouth) weren’t socialist, while the pilgrims did agree to common ownership, it was always intended that they move to private ownership. But the farmers did work, and they weren’t lazy, you have to keep in mind that the pilgrims that settled in Plymouth came from all over England and had different dialects and different ways of doing things. Take a group of farmers from all parts of a country in colonial times and tell them that they have to work together, see how far that gets you. William Bradford reported that the pilgrims were unwilling to work because they didn’t want to work with each other, that they were confused because herpderp different accents and different backgrounds, single men didn’t want to farm to feed the wives of married men, the wives of married men didn’t want to wash the clothes of single men, husbands didn’t want to see their wives in the fields planting corn for the community, etc. But the communal ownership worked, and in 1621 the pilgrims had the first reported thanksgiving, a year after they had landed. If the communal ownership hadn’t have worked, they <span class="bbcode-b">would have had their thanks giving after 1623 when they switched to private ownership, not before</span>.</p>
<p>After the pilgrims switched to private ownership (which was the plan all along), the situation improved because <span class="bbcode-b">there was no more squabbling between farmers that came from different backgrounds and didn’t get along with each other</span>. Wives weren’t complaining about having to wash anyone but their husbands clothes, single farmers weren’t complaining about having to feed married men’s wives, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe you should read a loveing book instead of parroting the agendas of right wing media. The idea that pilgrims were socialist or even communists (HA!) comes almost exclusively from right wingers and conservatives who have a vested interest in discrediting anything left of capitalism. The myth of the socialist pilgrims was perpetuated by tea party members in the 1950s who would have used anything for propaganda against the communist Russians. You know, the 1950s, when America changed its national motto from “E pluribus unum” to “In God We Trust” to perpetuate the idea that Americans were superior to the godless Russian communists.</p>

<p>Communism is a very controversial subject in which the people under the control of a dictatorship are often depicted as equal amoung eachother yet the outisde perspective is seen as they are slaves of the very own system established by the dictator. Freedom may never be achieved in any society but there is nothing wrong with striving for it as well offering human individuals the right to choose rather than being forced to suffer the punishment.</p>

We cannot even agree on basic morals. Some people think imperialist wars and death penalty is acceptable. Many red-necks sees no problem in torture. Not everyone think it is immoral to lie. Some big corps are committing organized theft.</p>
<p>It isn’t by perceived necessity as is the case with many criminals, but different set of morals.</p>

<p>yes, people would be better off if they didn’t have the baby, but why were they having a baby in the first place? because religious and other people who say sex before marriage is wrong, because of people who limit sex education and because of people who BLATANTLY FUCKING LIE when they say condoms do not work</p>

<p>that’s absolute bollocks if I may put it bluntly, morals are 100% subjective and while we all can agree on basic morals (killing is wrong), there are other morals that aren’t as easy to agree on (such as: sex isn’t bad)</p>

<p>You can’t really say that Stalin and Mao killed the people who starved in the famines. It was troubled time, you can’t blame them. It also assumes that they were omnipresent, something they were not.<br>
Assad fights against Islamic mercenaries.  Lenin got rid of pesky reactionaries. Please locate me to the claimed genocides of Fidel Castro.</p>

Bush 3.000.000 (Iraq and Afghanistan)<br>
Nixon 2.000.000+ not 70.000.<br>
Tobacco companies  100.000.000+.</p>

<p>im not trolling. fyi im a 20 yo virgin by choice, i’m sure if i went out trying to get laid i could. I don’t think i can wait til marriage so im a hypocrite in terms of that but I dont want to sex as many chicks as i can but the one i want to be with my entire life. i believe peer pressure and social pressure plays more of a role than evolution does. if children were brought up differently i’m very sure things would be different.</p>

completely relevant to the topic<br>
Also, if you can call women who don’t want to bring a child into this horrible fucking world selfish, there’s something wrong with you. If you want to continue this discussion, PM me.[/quote]<br>
and there is an extremely simple solution… don’t have sex!!! such a hard concept eh.</p>
<p>if you are ready and fully capable of taking care of a child then you can think about having sex. I think it should be illegal for anyone to have premarital sex not b/c of religion but if stats were taken i believe people would mentally and emotionally even some times physically be better off if people would be punished for having sex b4 marriage.</p>
<p>but to be more fair make it illegal if couples engaged in sex if they are; 1. incapable of supporting a child financially, and 2. incapable of raising a child on proper/appropriate values and morals. definitely should have another thread on the subject.</p>

              <p>[quote=“xryz, post:49, topic:463542”]if i can add some to that list:<br>
horrible selfish heartless women: 1.273 billion via abortion(since 1980 worldwide) i call abortions genocide on unborn children <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>for bush that isn’t genocide but is deaths via war.[/quote]</p>
<p>if I can add to that list: x where x is the number of conceptions formed due to incest, rape, (faulty contraceptive) purposefully damaged contraceptives, deceptive lack of contraceptives</p>
<p>and if I may add one more: x where x is the number of people who refuse to mate despite biologically and evolutionary reaching sexual maturity and hence being ‘fit to survive’</p>
<p>also xryz - <a href="http://www.hermes-press.com/socialism_failure.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.hermes-press.com/socialism_failure.htm</a> that link jesus christ it’s bad, I skimmed through some of it but it talks such absolute fucking nonsense and covers far too many subjects for me to thoroughly debunk, e.g., it mentions thatcher as a reason why communism is bad, seriously, communism is bad because it was in the uk for however many years and thatcher sold off all the government owned facilities (who is still hated by the general population of the uk to this day for doing so)</p>
