<p>Well done, you’re wrong on just about everything.</p>
<p>The pilgrims (in Plymouth) weren’t socialist, while the pilgrims did agree to common ownership, it was always intended that they move to private ownership. But the farmers did work, and they weren’t lazy, you have to keep in mind that the pilgrims that settled in Plymouth came from all over England and had different dialects and different ways of doing things. Take a group of farmers from all parts of a country in colonial times and tell them that they have to work together, see how far that gets you. William Bradford reported that the pilgrims were unwilling to work because they didn’t want to work with each other, that they were confused because herpderp different accents and different backgrounds, single men didn’t want to farm to feed the wives of married men, the wives of married men didn’t want to wash the clothes of single men, husbands didn’t want to see their wives in the fields planting corn for the community, etc. But the communal ownership worked, and in 1621 the pilgrims had the first reported thanksgiving, a year after they had landed. If the communal ownership hadn’t have worked, they <span class="bbcode-b">would have had their thanks giving after 1623 when they switched to private ownership, not before</span>.</p>
<p>After the pilgrims switched to private ownership (which was the plan all along), the situation improved because <span class="bbcode-b">there was no more squabbling between farmers that came from different backgrounds and didn’t get along with each other</span>. Wives weren’t complaining about having to wash anyone but their husbands clothes, single farmers weren’t complaining about having to feed married men’s wives, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe you should read a loveing book instead of parroting the agendas of right wing media. The idea that pilgrims were socialist or even communists (HA!) comes almost exclusively from right wingers and conservatives who have a vested interest in discrediting anything left of capitalism. The myth of the socialist pilgrims was perpetuated by tea party members in the 1950s who would have used anything for propaganda against the communist Russians. You know, the 1950s, when America changed its national motto from “E pluribus unum” to “In God We Trust” to perpetuate the idea that Americans were superior to the godless Russian communists.</p>

<p>Do Niall really need to write anything to own people now. Can’t he just declare his presence and win the argument?</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the story is that it is no a valid argument, even if it was true. There is lots of examples where people pay into a shared stockpile without problems. We all pay taxes for healthcare. (Unless you’re an American or do not live in an industrialized country). We share the cost of roads, bridges, farm subsidies to secure the county’s food production. And we all ripe the benefits. It is not socialism, but it sure is similar to the story HcoJustin told us.</p>
