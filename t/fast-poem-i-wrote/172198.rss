    <title>Fast Poem I Wrote</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fast-poem-i-wrote/172198</link>
    <description>I have to write some poems for school and I finally came up with something I could write about...

We skaters like to skate
So don’t be hating 
Wile we be skating
Like no skating signs make it a crime
Like it cost you a dime
Call the cops call the security
All were here to do is what you be hating
Hate, cuss, and discriminate us
We don’t care
This is what we do
Like you give a care?
Well we do
Backup and let us do our thing
Maybe you will learn a thing or 2
From the thing we like to do

I don&#39;t know if you would call it finished yet. And I wrote about this topic because i&#39;m tired of the skater haters...

And please rember I don&#39;t write poems every day so it&#39;s not that great. (probally havn&#39;t wrote one in couple of years)</description>

              <p>I love how people let everyone know their stuff is “fast, done in a few minutes, quick, something to pass time, etc”.</p>
<p>We all know you’re anticipating us to tell you how bad it sucks so you can boost your self confidence by flaming us saying that you said it was quick. whew.</p>
<p>And we all know what you’re going to say to that.</p>
<p>Anyways. I didn’t think it was very good to be honest, but then again I’m in AP Literature and we have to write an epic peom (thank god my teacher only makes us write 16 stanzas) about once a week.</p>

<p>He can write a ‘poem’ about skateboarding if he wants.</p>
<p>I liked it, even though it made you sound black in real life.</p>
<p>Ps - Don’t bother questioning me about the black in real life thing, i’m very raciest to there kind, i know.</p>

<p>Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,<br>
These rebel powers that thee array;<br>
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,<br>
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?<br>
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,<br>
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?<br>
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,<br>
Eat up thy charge?  is this thy body’s end?<br>
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant’s loss,<br>
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;<br>
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;<br>
Within be fed, without be rich no more:<br>
So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,<br>
And Death once dead, there’s no more dying then.</p>

<p>Yo mrrules<br>
Your poem is crappier than a dead mom on april fools<br>
When I read it, I felt like I was kicked in the jewels<br>
Everyone knows you little skaters are tools<br>
So instead instead of busting your asses in pools<br>
Get your ass back in school<br>
Then you won’t get pissed when you lose you job to Ra’ul</p>
