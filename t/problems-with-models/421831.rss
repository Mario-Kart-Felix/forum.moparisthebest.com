    <title>Problems with models</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-models/421831</link>
    <description>Okay so I have recently tried numerous things to fix my dkite custom model, I had to convert it from class.8 to itemdef here is my code

[b]case 7887:
  		 itemDef.modelid = 13701;
  		 itemDef.name = &quot;Dragon kiteshield&quot;;
  		 itemDef.modelZoom = 1560;
   		 itemDef.modelRotationY = 344;
  		 itemDef.modelRotationX = 1104;
  		 itemDef.modelOffset1 = -6;
 		 itemDef.modelOffset2 = -14;
  		 itemDef.anInt165 = 13700;
  		 itemDef.anInt200 = 13700;
		 itemDef.groundActions = new String[5];
		 itemDef.groundActions[2] = &quot;Take&quot;;
		 itemDef.groundActions = new String[5];
		 itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;
		 itemDef.itemActions[4] = &quot;Drop&quot;;
	break;[/b]          

I added extracted models to my raw file, the models were 13700/13701. I don&#39;t know if those aren&#39;t the right models
or if I did anything wrong, but if someone could please help me find a solution i&#39;d be very thankful.
