    <description>Hey guys, I have recently been having this issue on my RSPS where if I try to open a door, it will just not open, or it will open in a weird direction... I know it is all in the &quot;Doors.cfg&quot; file, and I know how to add a new door and stuff... All of that makes since to me but if I play around with it&#39;s code it will still never open. I have tried google&#39;ing it multiple times, and it still does not work.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,

Ian1045 :D</description>

              <p>That’s probably a crappy attempt at adding doors for that base then. There’s tutorials in the tutorial section to redo them.</p>
