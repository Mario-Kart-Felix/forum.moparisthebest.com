<p>If you were able to deal with it that’s great, I just found it difficult having to work with the item stack limit, way too much effort just to bot a new account <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> unless they’ve changed something since I did it?[/quote]<br>
True, but the stack limit only applies to items in the bank…</p>
<p>So if tou keep the logs noted in your inv, and the bot does a ‘bank all’ you will have 300 logs in your bank.<br>
the bot will then take from those logs,<br>
So it runs pratically like any other bot would.</p>
<p>The only thing that is annoying is that for fishing and wood cutting, you cant keep all the logs or fish, so just drop them, if money isnt a huge deal.</p>
