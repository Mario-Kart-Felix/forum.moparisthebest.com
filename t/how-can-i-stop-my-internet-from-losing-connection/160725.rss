    <description>    Well for 3days now I&#39;v hosted my server 24.7 and each day my internet has went down for a period of 6hours + I called Dell and they said my internet connection was perfect. They said it could be my router. Yet I have no idea how this would do this to my router... Don&#39;t suggest &#39;Oh just get a cheap Dedi&#39; . Any suggestions to my problem?</description>

              <p>I know but my parents perfer Belkin over every other. Belkin is all I got and I need a way to use it without all these dis connections. Could anyone at lease give me a tip how to get the internet back up after it resets? I tried a few things on troubleshoot… It likes to take its good old time restarting.</p>

              <p>Yes Dell is a internet provider but they recommended us a new router by them. Also the router I have now is a Belkin… I switched it I forgot.</p>
