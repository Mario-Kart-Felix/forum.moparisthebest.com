    <title>Suggestion or pretty much a Request. I think a good idea :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-or-pretty-much-a-request-i-think-a-good-idea/343761</link>
    <description>I think it would be cool to have like a Moderator Client or Utility for 317 Delta or 508 servers.



The idea is like having a client that ONLY has chat features, no Game-Play and has listed commands on the client for buttons

like a ban/mute/kick/ip-ban button on the client

and then chat box only.


That way you can interact with the server without Physically having to play the game.


What iam TRYING to say is, does anyone have something like this or know where abouts to make one?</description>
