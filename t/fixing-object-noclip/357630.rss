[B][U]First you need the Map Editor which can be found [url=http://www.google.org/showthread.php?t=123585]HERE[/url][/U][/B]

[b][u]How to run the editor[/u][/b]
I recomend using the &quot;runsrc.bat&quot; since it allows you to turn the &quot;object: #&quot; on and off so you can actually see the map instead of loads of yellow &quot;object: #&quot; everywhere.

[b][u]Loading a 377 cache[/u][/b]
This is very simple. Simply open up &quot;RS2 MapEditor.Standalone Jagex 3D Engine.src.com.rs.io.fs&quot; and then open &quot;JAGFS.java&quot; and find:
[code]
if(fileLength &lt; 0 || fileLength &gt; 0x7a120)
[/code]
Then change that to:
[code]
if(fileLength &lt; 0 || fileLength &gt; 0xffffff)
[/code]
Similar to the way you load a 377 cache on a 317 client.

[B]NOTE:[/B] You do not compile this so make sure you do download Oyxgen&#39;s edit. After re-reading the tutorial I realised I didn&#39;t say about compiling and jaring the stJ3D. Once again, make sure you do download one of the links below and replace it with your file or the map editor WILL NOT WORK.

Also make sure you use the runjar.bat instead of runsrc.bat. Then you should have no problems.

You can also download Oxygen&#39;s edit.

[b][u]The cache[/u][/b]
Before you edit the map or any map, I recommend delete the cache folder. And copying your client’s cache folder to the editor. Make a backup of your cache so you know, if anything does go wrong, you will always have it safe, and be able to replace it if anything does go wrong.

You [b]CAN[/b] use a 317 or 377 cache.

[b][u]Basic Controls[/u][/b]

[b]The file menus[/b]

[b]The Tile Editor &amp; Palette Tabs[/b]
[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w155/jammy780/Mapeditorhelp2-1.png[/img]

[b]Keyboard &amp; Mouse Controls[/b]
Q – Camera up
Z – Camera down
A – North
W – East
D – South
S – West
F10 – File Menu

Left mouse click – Main action button (after clicking a tool)
Right mouse click – Same as above

[b][u]Getting the coordinates of a location[/u][/b]
First load up your client and server, then login. There are two ways to do this.
1.	Once you’ve logged in, go to the place you wish to edit. Then logout, then go to your character file and look at the X and Y position. Note them down for a bit later.
2.	Again, once you’ve logged in, go to the place you wish to edit. Now type in ::mypos or ::cords (whichever one you have on your server). Note down the coordinates for later.

Now you have the coordinates, get your calculator! Either use your own, one on a phone, or the computer one. Type the second number in first, and divide it by 64, then do the same for the first number, [b]note them down in this order.[/b]

Eg. Varrock centre coordinates are X: 3210 Y: 3424.
Divide them by 64:
3424 / 64 = 53.5 (53)
3210 / 64 = 50.15625 (50)
Now in click load map, a little box should pop up. Type in the numbers you just got. Look at the example below if you don’t get it.

[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w155/jammy780/Mapeditorhelp3.png[/img]

Then click OK and the area should load.

[U][b]Getting the coordinates of a location V2[/b][/U]
First you need to get the coordinates of the location you want to go. So go to location and find the X and Y coordinates. Which is X: 2606 Y: 3093. Then divide them both by 64. So it&#39;s X: 40 Y: 48, now because the Map editor is slightly weird, you have to put the X and Y backwards. So click the load map button, and type in the box 48 then a space, then the second number, in this case 40. Now click OK and it will load the map.

Please if you need more help, PM me or post back here and i&#39;ll be happy to help.

[b][u]Creating a basic map[/u][/b]
Let’s load a nice blank area. The coordinates are X: 2701 Y: 2981. Now do what we did above.
If you got it right, you should have loaded a square of water, nothing else. If you haven’t I think you need to re-read the previous section and get it right.

Now on the creating the basic shape of the land, so you need to find the texture you want from the palette tab, I’m going to use road for this example. So select the road texture, by going to the Palette tab, and selecting “road”. Now go to toolkit and select “Paint Overlay”. Now we can begin to map the area. So find a starting point, and make it into the shape you want.

I recommend creating the outline of the map first, then filling it in. Also, if you make a mistake or decide you want to put it back to normal, simply select the water texture from the palette tab and click on the tile that you want bank to normal.

My map so far.
[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w155/jammy780/Mapeditorhelp4.png[/img]

Now I’m sure you don’t want your map to be flat on the floor, so go to the toolkit tab, and select the “set height” button from the toolkit tab, select where you want to edit your map and use your mouse wheel to adjust the height.

Note: I recommend you click 1 tile away from the very edge to give an effect like real RuneScape land, also, you only need about 2 wheel clicks down for the height. You also may need to adjust it a bit more to get a good effect.

This will take quite a lot of time, depending on how big you do the map your making. Once it’s done, it should look smooth a long the top. Example below.

[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w155/jammy780/Mapeditorhelp5.png[/img]

Now we will add a small area for a little square building. Simply select a texture from the palette tab. I’m going to use the “woodenfloor” texture. And I’m going to make a small square near the edge of the land. Like below.

[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w155/jammy780/Mapeditorhelp6.png[/img]

Now, you need to make it walkable, so you must click on the tile you want to make walkable, then on the &quot;Tile Editor&quot; tab, make sure &quot;Clipping&quot; is [b]Un-checked[/b].

You can also add some grass around it, and make it look nice. This is my finished map.

[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w155/jammy780/Mapeditorhelp7.png[/img]

Now go to the File menu and click Save. Now you can close the editor.

[b][u]Adding it in-game[/u][/b]

Now you’ve finished making the map I’m sure you want to add it to your client. First go to my [url=http://www.google.org/showthread.php?t=163039]other thread[/url], and do the very short tutorial. Now simply replace your cache with the map editor’s cache.

Make sure you make a [b]backup of your cache[/b] first!

Now let’s test it, so open up your client and server, and go to the coordinates: X: 2701 Y: 2981. (you may need to use ::noclip if you appear in the water)

[IMG]http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w155/jammy780/Mapeditorhelp8.png[/img]

[b]Note:[/b] My map looks different from the examples because I used a bad cache and it would load in my client, so I had to remake it quickly.

To finish off, you just need to add objects and decoration, and you’ll be done.

I hope this tutorial helped you out, if it did please post a comment.[/QUOTE]
[hr]
[b]NOW THAT THAT&#39;S OVER WITH..[/b]
Alright so ALL you have to do is find where you added your objects, click that tile or square w/e u wanna call it, and just simply make sure clipped is checked.

WALA!!!!!!!!!!!! Now when you log on, you cant noclip through the object.

Make sure you update the cache and let your players either download a new client with the new cache, or give them the cache so they can put it in their client folder.

Happy coding.</description>

<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">Mapeditorhelp6.png</span><span class="informations">660×576</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Now, you need to make it walkable, so you must click on the tile you want to make walkable, then on the “Tile Editor” tab, make sure “Clipping” is <span class="bbcode-b">Un-checked</span>.</p>
<p>You can also add some grass around it, and make it look nice. This is my finished map.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w155/jammy780/Mapeditorhelp7.png" title="Mapeditorhelp7.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w155/jammy780/Mapeditorhelp7.png" alt width="636" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">Mapeditorhelp7.png</span><span class="informations">682×536</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Now go to the File menu and click Save. Now you can close the editor.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Adding it in-game</span></span></p>
<p>Now you’ve finished making the map I’m sure you want to add it to your client. First go to my <a href="http://www.google.org/showthread.php?t=163039" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">other thread</a>, and do the very short tutorial. Now simply replace your cache with the map editor’s cache.</p>
<p>Make sure you make a <span class="bbcode-b">backup of your cache</span> first!</p>
<p>Now let’s test it, so open up your client and server, and go to the coordinates: X: 2701 Y: 2981. (you may need to use ::noclip if you appear in the water)</p>
<p><img src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w155/jammy780/Mapeditorhelp8.png" alt width="511" height="334"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> My map looks different from the examples because I used a bad cache and it would load in my client, so I had to remake it quickly.</p>
<p>To finish off, you just need to add objects and decoration, and you’ll be done.</p>
<p>I hope this tutorial helped you out, if it did please post a comment.[/QUOTE]<br>

<span class="bbcode-b">NOW THAT THAT’S OVER WITH…</span><br>
Alright so ALL you have to do is find where you added your objects, click that tile or square w/e u wanna call it, and just simply make sure clipped is checked.</p>
<p>WALA!!! Now when you log on, you cant noclip through the object.</p>
<p>Make sure you update the cache and let your players either download a new client with the new cache, or give them the cache so they can put it in their client folder.</p>
<p>Happy coding.</p>
