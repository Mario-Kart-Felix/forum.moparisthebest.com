    <title>[Pi]Multiple worlds, very simple</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-multiple-worlds-very-simple/436739</link>
    <description>Hey guys, people seem to be asking for this a fair bit these days so I just decided to post it. I&#39;ll be teaching you how to do it the quick, simple but badly explained and silly way in comparison to how you should do it.
Skip to &quot;2&quot; if your using different bases which playersave differently.
Character files in both bases need to save the same, what I mean by this is that the layout of how information is saved must be the same so lets say you have a Kill/death ratio both your bases for saving your kdr will have to be saved in the same format i.e. [code]kdr = 3.4[/code] if the format it is saved in is wrong then one of the worlds overwrites any data saved ruining the save file for the other world.


Make a folder in your C: drive called characters(click computer on your start up menu and you should see it) .
Now you want to make a common saving location for the character files and accessing location. This means that rather than saving the character files in the characters folder(Source\Data\characters) it will save it in the place you choose which will be somewhere both servers can access it.
You&#39;ll want to open up your playersave.java file(Source\src\server\model\players) as this is the file which saves your players files pretty much. Search for [code]./Data/characters/&quot;+playerName+&quot;.txt[/code], this is the path for where the Rsps saves your players files(and what to save it as). ), then change it to [code]C:/characters/&quot;+playerName+&quot;.txt[/code] and compile. Now all your player files should be start saving and being read in C:/characters on your hard drive.

[b]2.[/b]
Now, you want to be able to actually host two servers at once. All you need to do is for one server and client find the port(usually 43594) and change it to a different port i.e. 5555. Compile and then portforward.
You now have two working worlds which can be hosted of the same computer and load the same character files.



The tutorial is bad I know, feel free to reword, modify etc.</description>

<p>If you mean directories being changed it should be no issue changing them, I don’t think I actually ever did this so my bad that I didn’t add them in. If you mean the other possible thing I think you mean read below.</p>
<blockquote>I got asked a simple question multiple times (stated previously in the OP) and I decided to post how to do it here. It was originally an answer to a common question, [b]it isn't a guide on how to give your server multiple worlds with no bugs/glitches etc.[/b]</blockquote>
I'm aware this means that you can dupe, overwrite saves etc hence why it's not a guide that's meant to be used on it's own.
<p>I just want to emphasize it’s an answer that was buffed up with wording, oh the fact the title says “very simple”.<br>
If you lot would like me to remove this I will if you ask me to (politely ofc, I have a feeling I’  get some GAWD ITS AWFUL responses). Nobody asks me questions anymore since I don’t help out anymore so it doesn’t affect me regardless.</p>

              <p>If I’m understanding you correctly, yes you could but if you move source which I often did then you’d have to modify the code. I.e. Everytime when I updated my source and put it onto my old VPS i’d give it a different name before I uploaded the source to the VPS but ofc it just depends on the person that is programming it.</p>
<p>I just feel like saying this is a very basic way of doing it, it works 100% however it’s just basically doing what it says in the title. For this to be used in realistic terms a lot would need to be added.</p>

Make sure the character files are saved in a common location but also the character files are readable by both servers. My original post actually explains what your asking for however for practicalities sake you’d have to add to it. I was merely explaining the concept.<br>
Some basic things you might want to do.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whats explained in the OP.</li>
<li>Make sure people cannot log into the same account file on multiple worlds to avoid multi-logging (to avoid duping) (Server sided).</li>
<li>Connect the servers so that cross server chat is possible(server sided).</li>
<li>Add an option for the user to pick which world in the client that looks aesthetically pleasing(client sided).</li>
<li>Pat yourself on the back for a good job.</li>

Not quite sure, I just get asked like once or twice a week so I thought I’d post it to. But thanks.</p>
<p>To everyone:<br>
All I’m saying in this alleged snippet is how to change where the server saves and creates character files and that they should change the port so they can host multiple sources. I doubt what I’m saying is wrong but I think I’m most probably explaining it wrong.<br>
To cut it down into one sentence, change 1 path for character saving and change ports is all my tutorial is saying… You can’t really go wrong with that, the only reason its got a fair bit of writing is cause I was trying to explain it which failed lol.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, people seem to be asking for this a fair bit these days so I just decided to post it. I’ll be teaching you how to do it the quick, simple but badly explained and silly way in comparison to how you should do it.<br>
Skip to “2” if your using different bases which playersave differently.<br>
Character files in both bases need to save the same, what I mean by this is that the layout of how information is saved must be the same so lets say you have a Kill/death ratio both your bases for saving your kdr will have to be saved in the same format i.e. <code>kdr = 3.4</code> if the format it is saved in is wrong then one of the worlds overwrites any data saved ruining the save file for the other world.</p>
<p>Make a folder in your C: drive called characters(click computer on your start up menu and you should see it) .<br>
Now you want to make a common saving location for the character files and accessing location. This means that rather than saving the character files in the characters folder(Source\Data\characters) it will save it in the place you choose which will be somewhere both servers can access it.<br>
You’ll want to open up your playersave.java file(Source\src\server\model\players) as this is the file which saves your players files pretty much. Search for <code>./Data/characters/"+playerName+".txt</code>, this is the path for where the Rsps saves your players files(and what to save it as). ), then change it to <code>C:/characters/"+playerName+".txt</code> and compile. Now all your player files should be start saving and being read in C:/characters on your hard drive.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2.</span><br>
Now, you want to be able to actually host two servers at once. All you need to do is for one server and client find the port(usually 43594) and change it to a different port i.e. 5555. Compile and then portforward.<br>
You now have two working worlds which can be hosted of the same computer and load the same character files.</p>
<p>The tutorial is bad I know, feel free to reword, modify etc.</p>
