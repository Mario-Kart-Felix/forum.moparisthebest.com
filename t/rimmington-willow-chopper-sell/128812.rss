    <title>Rimmington Willow Chopper + Sell</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rimmington-willow-chopper-sell/128812</link>
    <description>I&#39;m willing to pay up to one mil(1000K) gp on a good working script and not stolen but MADE.
Here are the necessary steps that I would like for it to do.

1. Log in with user and password in mind.
2. With rune axe equipped, find colors for willows and begin cutting.
3. When full, walk north and into the general store and sell all willows(4gp ea)
4. With money in the first slot, keep that in thought and walk back south to the willows.
5. Continue woodcutting willows with money in first slot in mind.
6. When full walk north and into the general store and sell all willows from the second slot down.
REPEAT

You get the flow, but what I would like is:
1. When selling the willows, right click and sell 10 three times on the last lost out of all of the slots.
2. Anti-Bans, etc.
3. Any other necessary suggestions such as logging in and out
4. Have &quot;How many logs to cut until log out&quot;.

Make the script keep track with the money I receive in the progress report...did I mention make the script write a progress report every completed run? :P

When finished, have someone loyal to test the script in case of any errors that I would receive. If I do find errors, the maker of the script MUST help me until I have successfully run the script flawlessly meaning no errors, run times, etc.</description>

              <p>Ok I just changed my mind, instead of the hard work on the flawless part, just make it a script that could at least work since I’ll be looking back here and there during the day, but a 100% working script would also be good. I just lost interest in woodcutting for endless hours again since I got hacked and banned with both accounts having 90+ woodcutting. As any case, it would be nice to have a script that can get that stressful hours not go to waste and regain them back with my new account. I am trying to learn how to make scripts by learning the outdated version, updated version, Java programming, Visual Basics Programming, and sadly learning to read/write or maybe just understanding it. Enough of me talking, so I just hope my request will be fulfilled as soon as possible.</p>

              <p>Alright then thank you! If any takers are still interested in making this script for me, I’ll consider it. Please make sure the script is flawless and no errors are made. I’m very picky on buying scripts with spending my runescape gold for a script especially 1 mil. Sorry for being so picky.</p>
