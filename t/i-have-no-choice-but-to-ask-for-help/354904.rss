    <title>I have no choice, but to ask for help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-no-choice-but-to-ask-for-help/354904</link>
    <description>Okay, before we even get started here, I want you to understand that I actually did have everything working at one point, so I&#39;m not stupid. And I have done hours and hours and hours and hours of reading on how to fix this, but I have had no luck. So I am asking for some help now :\

I had my ports forwarded and everything was running perfectly, and then my internet went out for about 20 minutes. I figured that I would unplug my routers and my modem for a minute and then plug them in.. worst mistake I&#39;ve made in a while.

My ports are no longer forwarded and I can NOT get it to work again, I&#39;ve tried and tried and tried.

The thing that&#39;s tricky about my house, is that I have my modem, which plugs into a router, and then that router runs up into my room and powers my router. So all together I have 1 modem and 2 routers.

ANY help is appreciated. Please and Thank You</description>
