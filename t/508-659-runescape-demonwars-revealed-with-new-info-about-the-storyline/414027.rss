    <description>Greetings I am DemonWars.

Today i am releaving the RSDW v3.

These will have:
[508]
1: all of the features of the v2
2: Updated HP shown
3: more NPC dialogue
4: more NPC transformations
5: more Magic curses
6: A better storyline
7: more customs
8: a blank RSDW source for starters
9: new home ofcourse
10: more NPCs

The V3 will be released in 3 parts:
(they will all have the same things but will have other storyline)
1: The Coming Darkness
[ This will explain how the Demon invasion started and make u get special stuff to help you in the other parts ]

2: Grim Tales
[ now you will be inside the invasion and you will have to fight yourself through the demons that are aggressive and will be spawned to kill you ]

3: SECRET!!!
[ this will be revealed when the release is 1 week away ]

[ READ! ]

The v3 will not be the end of the story, i am going to stretch the story as long as you want me to.

[659]
{keep in mind that this will be the V1 of the 659 series}
1: all the original stuff of the MezzyScape562 base (i have permission!)
2: as much as possible features of RSDW 508
(more will be revealed when i have more then 2 things to add)

Storyline:
V1: Scars from the past
[ although Varrock and camelot have bin oblitirated by the wars between the gods and demons, Death has not givin up yet.
with the Savior of Varrock gone he used the last 150 years to gather a even greater army. 
you need to gather your friends in order to stop him, while further in the story you will need to betray them to get the &quot;Amulet of DemonWars&quot;, this amulet will give you the power of Bandos, Armadyl, Zamorak, saradomin and even Death himself. ]

This will be released when i am done, i will try to not make it 8 months again, but then again, those 8 months gave me Great results right?

At the end of the second DemonWars era, you will be either MOD (Master of Death) or Divine Skull-Lord, depending on what side you choose.

[ Q&amp;A ]

Q: Why the second DemonWars era?
A: the last era is what created the wilderness, it was solved by The DemonLord (DemonWars&#39;s Grandfather)

Q: Wait DemonWars is a person?
A: ofcourse, You play DemonWars in the v1,v2 and even v3

Q: Why did the so called &quot;The DemonLord&quot; call the era The DemonWars era?
A: he didn&#39;t, King Lathas did, (king roald&#39;s Grandfather)

Q: Can you please explain the history of RSDW?
A: sure here:

Year: 145
Location: Varrock Castle

Story:
5 guards with their general run through the gate,
general: Ur highnes!
King lathas: stand still general whats the problem?
general: we just came back from the Holy forest!

King Lathas: WHAT??
general: sire, it has bin reduced to ashes!
King Lathas: is this a joke soldier?
general: No sire, there are demons everywhere!!
King lathas: By saradomin, what can we do now?
general: we came to get you.
King Lathas: i will go nowhere! if these demons will attack i must be here to protect the people of varrock.
general: but sire, the demons are only 40ft north of your castle, the towns people cant live without a king!
King Lathas: and a kingdom cannot exist without a king, i stay here.
general: as you wish sire, rookie!
rookie soldier: yes sir?
general: go get 9 other guards and defend the castle.
Rookie soldier: yes sir.

King lathas: i need to ask him for a favor.
General: but sire, he is the most dangerous criminal we have ever seen.
King Lathas: he almost killed 32 guardsmen with no weapon.
general: but sire, how do we know he is not going to kill you when he gets out?
King lathas: the reason he killed all those gaurds was only to warn me that this would happen.
general: how do you know that sire?
King lathas: he told me in the dungeons 2 weeks ago.
general: why didn&#39;t you say anything sire?
King lathas: becouse i thought he was mad, now i know he was telling the truth.
general: but how do yo think he is going to help?
king lathas: i dont know yet, but he may be helpfull.
