    <description>█Story█
There was a breakout in GodWars and all the GodWars dungeon monsters came out and destroyed Almost everyone except 2 Humans named Chino and Killer. Killer wanted to keep the Gods in the world of Gielinor still being worshipped. Chino wanted to bring down the order of gods and let him be The new order of Gods. Killer wanted to stop this but for sometime they managed to keep peace then suddenly Chino got his clans man and destroyed all the Statues of Gods and Alters. Killer pushed them out of Excetaria into Miscellania where the Unforgiven Clan war formed. They got their name from the Legendary Pker&#39;s who gave them this name for being destroyers of gods. So now these 2 Clans fight for the world of Gielinor(runescape).

█Story█<br>
There was a breakout in GodWars and all the GodWars dungeon monsters came out and destroyed Almost everyone except 2 Elderly Powerful Humans named Chino and Killer. Killer wanted to keep the PVP going in the world of Gielinor. Chino wanted to restore the economy and world of humans Guthix tried to restore piece but Chino destroyed him.

Why would Chino kill Guthix… I thought that would be something the “Killers” would do…?</p>
