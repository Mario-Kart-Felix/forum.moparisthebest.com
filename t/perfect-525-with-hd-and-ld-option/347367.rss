    <title>Perfect 525 with HD and LD option</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/perfect-525-with-hd-and-ld-option/347367</link>
    <description>Today i&#39;m on a devotion to make a 100% perfect 525 using a 508 base and client and optional HD in it.

I&#39;m going to use Espeon&#39;s Source and i&#39;m still looking for a 508 HD client without an antileech(lol)

I&#39;ve spent hours making vesta statius spirit shields and pvp drop items such as ancient stat models, and i&#39;m finally finished and ready to inject them into my client.

Now this server is going to be 100% perfect not 1 interface or feature not 100% working thriving for perfection.

Now please remember this is only day one, i will post pictures and progress up as soon as i find a client, if you know of one it would be appreciated to share.
