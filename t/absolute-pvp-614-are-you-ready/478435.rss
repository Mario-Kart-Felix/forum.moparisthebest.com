    <title>Absolute-Pvp 614 | Are You Ready?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/absolute-pvp-614-are-you-ready/478435</link>
    <description>[b]This will be updated every once in a while[/b].

Basically Absolute-Pvp is a legacy based source that I&#39;ve had for some time now, I stopped development of it about 7 months and just now started to get back into develoupment. My goal is to bring back 614 sources like legacy because I believe that, it was at that reversion that runescape really changed combat as in hybrids,zerkers and just in general pking. I rarely see any 614 releases and [s]I do plan to release this at some point in the future[/s].

[b]Another thing to keep there really isn&#39;t much a skilling system. It is completely PVP oriented. [/b]

Now to get started:

All I&#39;ve done so far is integrate MySQL into the server.

[code=text]Features:

Fixed player saving.

Added Anti-Flooding System ( wasn&#39;t my work).

Fixed all known dupes including the &quot;x&quot; log dupe.

Add my own personal economyresetter( wasn&#39;t hard).

Near perfect switching (Amazing Briding/Hybriding)

Fixed Achievement Diaries (legacy&#39;s had lots of problems).

Fully working PMing System.

Fixed Korasis Special.

Re-wrote combat, 10x better compared the orignal legacy source.

Added correct item bouns to most items including brightleaf ( not hard).

Created many more teleports with different regions (a few more than what came with the source).

Cleaned up the files.

Created my very own donation system for ranks such as Silver and Gold.

Created a very unique dice system that only works inside the dicing zone, you need a legit host rank to host and some of the commands include ::givedice, ::setmin , ::setmax , ::cleardice, ::resetdice

Created my own help system that notices all staff that someone is in the help area.

Unique Yell System , With multiple levels of yelling. 

Created gametime system to avoid players for trading starters.

IP detection which disables players with the same IP to trade or fight.

Added pounch system using commands.

Added a few shops.

Added many player &amp; staff commands.

Fixed Trading and removed the second window dupe amongest other common ones.

Fixed most Spells including TB &amp; all Miasmic spells.

Fully working auto casting.

Added Tags System (wasn&#39;t hard).

Added the Auth system ( wasn&#39;t my work).

Added Clan-Chat system using commands.

There were many more things I added to this but since I&#39;ve had it so long I forgot. [/code]


[b]Now for a few pictures :D[/b].
