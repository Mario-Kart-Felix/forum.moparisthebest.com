    <title>Help with hosting issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-hosting-issue/422681</link>
    <description>For some reason when I upgraded my internet speed from a static ip to a dhcp address, I can no longer host my server at my house. Sometimes my ip rarely changes from starting out at like 64 to 204 and if it does I can host again. Could anyone explain it thoroughly for me please and if there is still a way to host? Because I&#39;ve tried everything I know of.</description>

<p>Your IP address changes or your IPv4 address changes? Davidi2 or someone made a tutorial on how to stop your IPv4 address from changing.</p>

<p>I believe my IPv4 changes but if I was to stop it from changing and leave it on what it is, I would never be able to host again because for some reason if my IP address starts with only two numbers I can’t host any type of server.</p>
