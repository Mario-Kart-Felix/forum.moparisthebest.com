    <title>Question about server status page!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-server-status-page/309022</link>
    <description>ok so i remember that the old status page had a place for hamachi servers. and now i cannot find it.. so obviously it is gone. is there a place that someone can tell me about that i can post my server on even though it has hamachi?.. because i can&#39;t post on mopar or runelocus cause it just says server is offline, you can&#39;t post.
i know all of you are thinking i should just make a non ham server but i can&#39;t.. i have tried time after time and it seems the portforwarding part is what holds me back. i have memorized how to make a server, but have never successfully made one. no matter what tut i use. i think it is because i only have a lap top. once i get a hold of a new desktop i will try but for now i am pro-ham =P so if someone could help me that&#39;d be great. thanks

              <p>i think the hamachi were taken out, but maybe check different sites…<br>
hmm looks like your back to playing other people servers not your own <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
