    <description>So I&#39;m wanting to develop something new, as opposed to all the same old servers competing against each other. The idea is that I make this server and client (Project LOTR) with massive game changes. When I looked up the idea all I found was this https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=620959.0 people basically just dissed his idea and it doesn&#39;t look like he made it.

First off. Classes
Accounts starting off will be required to choose a class. Hunter, Lore-master, or Champion. Each class has its own starter pack and can spawn from unique locations from each other. I hopefully will add some class-specific items, possible rings, titles, or maybe even more if I get more ideas. Each class spawns a different looking character as well so far.

Titles. Like in runescape, but a bit more on topic here.

Client. Of  course all the cache to go with any custom work as well.

Might change text or login box yet, client gets a background at random.

Basically I want to change how the game works.

The class you choose from the beginning will help you in pvp. 
Lots of pvp titles and eventually rewards as well

I want to create bosses related to the books. Smaug, golem, gandalf, and more are all going to be npc&#39;s.

Now I know custom maps are a lot of work and from experience wont turn out well for me. Maybe this is something for the future but I doubt it.

There is lots of places and things I know I can use to make a pretty sweet game. 

But I want the armor and weapons all to be unique to the server, so lots of weapon names are gonna change as well as their stats and requirements. I have been playing LOTRO as well thats also where some item names and properties can come from.

Ugh I should watch all the blu rays once I have the chance too I would be busy forever.</description>

              <p>Yeah I’ve now got more of an idea for home. Changing the size of the player was not a good idea so that is out. Aslo might be odd but I found the best way to get popular weapons from the movie I’m going to grab a bunch of information from sites like <a href="http://www.lotrfanshop.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lord of the Rings Merchandise Shop - All Tolkien Jewelry, Swords and Products</a> lol as odd as it is, its right to the point of items I’ll have in game.</p>
<p>I’m going to try to keep it a little less cheasy as possible throwing up some more custom items. Pvp will all have to learn by ear once the server is done, should be interesting.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.upload.ee/image/3981340/Screenshot_2014-04-03_16.42.50.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
I haven’t determined any stats yet but it will be complete.</p>
