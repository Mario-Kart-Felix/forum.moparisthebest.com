That North-Korea tested was only between 2,2 and 4 kiloton.<br>
The bomb that was used in Japan was 13 kiloton, and US has bomb on 50 megaton, so it was little.</p>
<p>btw, the earthquake was only 4,7 on Richter magnitude scale, and that is quite normal.<br>
You need 32 kilotons to begin the make some damage on unsolid buildings.</p>

        <p>[quote=“R.I.P RSC, post:70, topic:280364”]It still doesn’t prevent crime. Robbing someone isn’t the only crime. Like I said in a different thread: if I bump into someone, and that person finds out he lost his wallet, he’ll shoot me. But then he feels in his other pocket, and finds his wallet there. So by letting everyone be there own judge, a lot of innocents get killed.</p>
<p>I doubt carrying guns prevents cyber-crime, murder, theft from warehouses which is discovered after the thief is gone, etc… BTW, I doubt it’s legal in any western country to kill someone who mugged you.[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote=“atrox_, post:76, topic:280364”][quote author=T4_ link=topic=370358.msg2804130#msg2804130 date=1243625606]</p>

<p>Everyone knows how I am about weapons, I believe everyone should carry a gun with them at all times so crime would be non-existent.</p>

<p>Finally, someone who agrees with me. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

But then… all disputes will be ended with a shoot out.[/quote]</p>
<p>Allowing law-abiding citizens to carry guns does not give anyone the right to be their own judge, jury, or executioner.  It is only legal to use deadly force if you are in fear for your life or someone else’s life.  If someone is mugging you with a weapon, or is trying to murder you I would say you would be in fear for your life right?  So you would be justified in using your gun.</p>
<p>Before concealed carry laws passed in each state here, gun control nuts promoted a lot of FUD like you two are talking about.  Things like ‘it will be like the wild west, shoot outs on every street corner’, ‘people won’t call the police they will just shoot whenever they want’ etc etc.  In practice, none of these things have ever happened, and crime has dropped substantially.  The main reason people overlook (either intentionally or unintentionally) is that these are law-abiding citizens carrying the guns, people who have never been arrested for any felony or violent misdemeanor, so it should be obvious the more guns you can get into the hands of people like this the lower crime will be.  Gun laws preventing ownership or carrying do nothing to criminals, their occupation is by definition breaking the law, so they don’t care about gun laws.  What criminals do care about is if they run the risk of dying because their intended victim may be armed to protect themselves, this is the only real deterrent to crime.</p>
<p>[quote=“R.I.P RSC, post:73, topic:280364”]Rape can’t be prevented if a woman carries a gun. The rapist can easily disarm his victim by knocking her out.</p>
<p>The only way a gun can prevent murder is by killing the attempting murderer. By preventing it, you are a murderer.</p>
<p>Kidnapping is done quite a lot by multiple culprits. Carrying a gun doesn’t protect you against 5 people that carry a gun too.[/quote]</p>
<p>Women prevent rape all the time with guns.</p>
<p>Using deadly force to defend yourself from death is not a crime anywhere is it?  If it is a crime somewhere, then it is a sad human-rights violation, because people have a natural, or God-given, right to protect themselves…</p>
<p>You don’t want the ability to protect yourself if you so choose?  I do.</p>
<p>By the way, a vast majority of crime is stopped just by the presence of a gun without firing a shot, I can’t seem to find the statistics right now but I think it is above 80%.  That makes sense if you think about it, because if some guy is robbing you with a knife or a gun, and you pull out a gun and point it at him, 9 times out of 10 he is going to run away like a scared little girl without you even having to fire a shot.</p>

<p>That makes sense if you think about it, because if some guy is robbing you with a knife or a gun, and you pull out a gun and point it at him, 9 times out of 10 he is going to run away like a scared little girl without you even having to fire a shot.</p>

<p>Or he could be a raving lunatic and shoot you first!</p>

<p>Then he would shoot you whether you have a gun or not.  At least this way you can shoot back.<br>

<p>Ok? So your being mugged and the guy is holding a gun, then you pull out yours and he shoots you, oh dear you didn’t get a chance… What then?[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s not like you have to pull out your gun, you have a choice.  And a gun isn’t going to protect you against everything, but it is definitely better than not having any options.</p>

<p>I couldn’t really make heads or tails of that article, I don’t know if the woman was involved in a crime or not.  But does anyone here honestly believe that if someone breaks into your home with the intent and means (like a gun) to kill you and your family that you do not have a natural and God-given right to defend yourself with deadly force?</p>

<p>I dunno about natural or god-given, being pretty much an atheist, but we definitely have a legal one in the UK… i assume its pretty much the same as the US, we have some act that I don’t remember the name of, the purpose of which is basically to make things that would usually be illegal legal in certain situations. It specifically mentions, IIRC (or maybe there was just a precedent set fkn years ago, im not a lawyer :P) that in certain extreme cases of self defense killing your attacker is excusable.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 31, 2009, 12:51:07 am[/size][hr]And because I’m a weirdo who can’t drop things,</p>

(2) Subsection (1) above shall replace the rules of the common law on the question when force used for a purpose mentioned in the subsection is justified by that purpose.</blockquote>
<p>And this was sorta translated by some random high up police dude i forgot to name check as</p>
<blockquote>“So long as you only do what you honestly and instinctively believe is necessary in the heat of the moment, that would be the strongest evidence of you acting lawfully and in self-defence. This is still the case if you use something to hand as a weapon”

        <p>I don’t know about other countries, but in Australia if you kill someone in self defence then you lack the intent required for a murder charge, which means you’d be charged with second degree murder, or manslaughter, at most.</p>

<p>How is walking around with a concealed handgun provocative or potentially dangerous?  If the gun is on you, it isn’t in a place where kids can get to it is it?  So are you saying that no one should walk around at night because ‘that is when most murders happen’? (I’d like to see the statistics on that by the way)  Again I reiterate, you are never forced to use your gun, so you wouldn’t in a crowded area, but if you were walking down an alley and a few guys jumped out to attack you, of course you would pull it and use it if need be.</p>

<p>How is walking around with a concealed handgun provocative or potentially dangerous?  If the gun is on you, it isn’t in a place where kids can get to it is it?

<p>This is true. It gets worse though - people in Australia who do actually possess a firearms licence are treated like second class citizens.</p>
<p>With regards to rapists and muggers/robbers, there are a few psychological aspects to take into consideration.<br>
Robbers rarely have the intention of killing somebody; they’re often extremely nervous and on edge, too. This is also true for muggers. So pull a gun on one and they’d probably shit themselves - they aren’t prepared to die.<br>
Same goes for rapists. Try finding a rapist who won’t back off when his target is armed.</p>
