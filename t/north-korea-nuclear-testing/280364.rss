    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/north-korea-nuclear-testing/280364</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;North Korea says it has staged a &quot;successful&quot; underground nuclear test, prompting international condemnation.

The state says it was more powerful than the previous one in October 2006.

A number of external agencies have confirmed a powerful explosion took place, suspected to be associated with a nuclear test.

US President Barack Obama described the North Korean action as a threat to international peace. Crisis talks were being held in South Korea.

An emergency session of the UN Security Council is being convened by Russia, which currently occupies the council&#39;s rotating presidency.

BBC world affairs correspondent David Loyn says North Korea appears to have moved from a posture of negotiation to confrontation over the nuclear issue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>A gun is about as subtle as a sledgehammer when you want to commit murder - the people that do carry out murders with guns are likely to get caught.<br>
Many murders are personal anyway, like husbands killing wives (or visa versa), or children killing parents. In these cases it would be easy enough to kill the target with some other implement, such as a knife or medicinal overdose - this is because they trust you, and you can get close enough to do the deed.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the criminal that just tried to rob you had a gun, despite the law, and you were at a disadvantage induced by the law for abiding by the law.</p>

dont they have a system in america where there are all the criminals linked up on the same injection machine and there are about 7 activation buttons and one of them randomly activates the machine? that way no one person is responsible because no one knows who did it</p>

<p>It’s not really allowing everyone to carry guns.  I am talking about only allowing law-abiding citizens to carry guns.

I expect both of your example cases to happen, a 70 year old lady has just as much of a right to protect herself as anyone else, and without a gun even less of an ability.  And mothers have been known to lift cars to save their children, hell yes they would shoot someone who was trying to kill their kid between the eyes.</p>

Yakman from what I can see in that article, it’s not really saying less guns == less crime/murder. It’s saying less felons owning guns == less crime/murder. It’s saying less illegal guns == less crime/murder.</p>
<p>But how about law-abiding citizens? When you take guns from them, does crime rate drop? I’d like to see statistics for that.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Thing is, and this isn’t just pointed at you but to anyone pro-gun: If you allow citizens to carry guns, criminals can carry guns too without being arrested, or spotted by those who want a peaceful life. It makes everyone equal, when you don’t really want to. Do you expect a 70 year old lady to shoot the guy who’s mugging her? Do you expect a mother with a young child to shoot a man between the eyes? Do you really think the majority will just pull out their guns and shoot?</p>
<p>What about paranoid people? They’ll shoot you when you make a sudden move.[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s not really allowing everyone to carry guns.  I am talking about only allowing law-abiding citizens to carry guns.  It is already illegal for convicted felons to own guns at all, the point is that they are criminals who break laws for a living, so gun control doesn’t affect them, and only disarms law-abiding citizens, which obviously causes crime to rise.  I expect both of your example cases to happen, a 70 year old lady has just as much of a right to protect herself as anyone else, and without a gun even less of an ability.  And mothers have been known to lift cars to save their children, hell yes they would shoot someone who was trying to kill their kid between the eyes.  I don’t know about the majority, but everyone that does it stops a crime, so any is better than none.  Not to mention just the thought that your victim may be carrying a gun strikes fear in to the heart of criminals, they have said so on record countless times.</p>

<p>Oh, mopar why do you carry your gun with you nearly everywhere?</p>

</aside>
<p>For the protection of myself and others.  I sincerely hope I never have to use my gun against another human being, but if that person is threatening my or someone else’s life, then yes, I will try to the best of my ability to stop it.</p>
<p>Think about the killing at Virginia Tech, one thing the news didn’t cover at all is that out of the first 5 or so people the psycho killed, 2 of them had concealed carry permits, and if it wasn’t for a law saying that concealed carry holders couldn’t carry on campus, the killings may have well stopped right there.  But no, due to gun control laws disarming law-abiding citizens, more than 30 people died needlessly.  Who can say if you will meet a similar psycho when you go out to lunch, the store, or a movie?  I am not going to bet my life or the life of my loved ones on it, would you?</p>

              <p>[quote=“bootnecklad, post:122, topic:280364”]What need for a gun do you need when walking around?</p>
<p>OH SHIT SOMEONES ABOUT TO KILL ME BECAUSE THEY ARE ON A MURDEROUS RAMPAGE!!![/quote]</p>
<p>How about when you’re older and married, and your wife works late at night in a dangerous neighborhood. Would you want her to keep a gun for safety?</p>
<p>How about when you’re walking home from a buds house at night, and a bunch of people jump you and steal your wallet/money? I’ve been jumped many times, it sucks. If I had a gun I wouldn’t hesistate to pull it on them (note: I would never shoot them). Getting your ass kicked by 8 dudes is never much fun.</p>
<p>And about those rampages you mentioned, those DO happen. And they would be stopped much quicker if more people had guns.</p>
