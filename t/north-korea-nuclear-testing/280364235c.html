This gun control matter can easily be solved with statistics:<br>
<a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-guncontrol.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-guncontrol.htm</a></p>
<p>That is in the USA. We could also compare Europe to the US, and you’ll see the same correlation.<br>
Basically,<span class="bbcode-b"> <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">the less guns the less murders</span></span></span>. It’s proven countless of times before. Nothing’s wrong with that, is it?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It can be solved easily with statistics, but gun control nuts like the ones who wrote that page you linked to like to use word play and twist statistics to try to make them say what they want them to.  For example, the title of what you linked to:</p>
<p>[quote]Myth: Gun control laws won’t reduce the <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">gun homicide rate</span></span>.</p>
<p>Fact: The <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">murder rate</span></span> almost always falls after the enforcement of gun control laws. [/quote]</p>
<p>In the myth, they talk about the “gun homicide rate”, yet in the fact, they subtly change it to “murder rate”.  Anyone that takes the time to read these can see that they are distinctly different statistics.  If you ban baseball bats, the rate at which they are used will slowly decrease, same with knives, guns, or any other item.</p>
<p>However, when I say that more guns equals less crime, I am talking about the overall crime rate, which in every instance is reduced with an increase in guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens.  Which, if you think logically about it, makes perfect sense.[/quote]</p>
<p>ok so what from I understand, more guns equals less general crime but more murders. Would it be illogical to think that by having more guns you replace theft and robbings with something far worse, namely murder?</p>
<p>I’ve never thought of it that way before, but if you asked me now, I would prefer to reduce murders.</p>
<p>Also if i wanted to be pedantic, all gun homicides are murders, not all murders are gun homicides. So reducing murders is better then just reducing gun homicides.</p>
<p>[quote=“Mopman, post:112, topic:280364”]The comment about the constitution was also a little strange, since the constitution being the last word in a legal argument (which I assume is what you meant by “worshipping” it) is the POINT of a constitution. A federal government is not supposed to be able to randomly contradict the constitution without an amendment, which is a fairly long process which requires the backing of a majority (all?) of its member states (in the US anyway).</p>
<p>We don’t have a consitution in the UK as such of course, but we do have a bill of rights (which is the only set of amendments to the constitution relevant here relevant here, right? not sure on that though, US law is confusing as fuck :P)</p>
<p>I’m sure you’d be pretty pissed if the government randomly went against the uk bill of rights without proper process.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I’m not sure how indepth the process was to repeal the right to bear arms for defense (which was a right, at least for protestants, in our original bill of rights, something that people skip over quite often for some reason). I <em>hope</em> it was done properly, or my argument pretty much just fell over <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I know how they were allowed to do it, but I don’t know if it was as simple as “here is new law, bill of rights now void” - it’s possible it was like that, but in the US I think there is a general feeling that their bill of rights carries more weight, their country was founded around the constitution, rather than the more evolutionary way ours came in (essentially, “the royal family running everything sucks, we are protestants, lets protect new uk from being raped by royals again”)</p>
<p>man i type some shit stream of consciousness posts when its late[/quote]</p>
<p>by this I meant how both the bible the US constitution are becoming less relevant as time goes on.</p>
<p>for example in the bible (and in the quran) is says you shouldnt eat pork, presumably because it carries many parasites and diseases which were difficult if not impossible to treat when the bible was written. But in modern times we have very good healthcare, an understanding of microbes and disease and consequently eating pork now is no more dangerous then eating beef, lamb, chicken or any other bibically clean meat.</p>
<p>Yet there still exist people who do not eat pork because the bible or quran says so.</p>
<p>With the right to bear arms issue, you must remember that when the constitution was written after a long war involving the then-new America. Surrounded by enemies from all sides, I suspect the US founding fathers thought that in these uncertain times, it would be very useful to arm their citizens to have some kind of reserve militia. So in the case of an invasion, there could be a strong insurgency much like there was in Iraq and Vietnam, to give the invaders a very hard time.</p>
<p>Only today, with occasional exceptions of terrorist attacks the US mainland has been peaceful for ~200 years. The only wars the US has been involved in are foreign ones.</p>
<p>My musings about being able to change the constitution were in contrast with bible and quran. You cant change holy books in theory, but you can change constitutions. In theory.<br>
I’ve heard American schoolchildren are taught the constitution and have to memorise passages from it, they are taught to respect it in a way that is very similar to the way the bible is treated.</p>
<p>In practice, you cant change the constitution because most people have been “indoctrinated” and simply would not have it. That way passages that have long ago lost their relevance are still there today.</p>
<p>I thought a constitution is meant to be controlled by its people, but it seems to me to be the other way around in the USA.</p>
<p>Also, in practice, if you took away the right to bear arms tomorrow, it wouldnt work because a lot of people still have guns, and they would not give them up easily.<br>
This does make it a very difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>EDIT: I should add that its unfair to say the entire US is like this, since gun control laws differ from state to state. I suppose its one way to tell in which states do people think for themselves and in which state do they blindly worship.</p>

<p>How about when you’re older and married, and your wife works late at night in a dangerous neighborhood. Would you want her to keep a gun for safety?</p>
<p>How about when you’re walking home from a buds house at night, and a bunch of people jump you and steal your wallet/money? I’ve been jumped many times, it sucks. If I had a gun I wouldn’t hesistate to pull it on them (note: I would never shoot them). Getting your ass kicked by 8 dudes is never much fun.</p>
<p>And about those rampages you mentioned, those DO happen. And they would be stopped much quicker if more people had guns.</p>

Yakman from what I can see in that article, it’s not really saying less guns == less crime/murder. It’s saying less felons owning guns == less crime/murder. It’s saying less illegal guns == less crime/murder.</p>
<p>But how about law-abiding citizens? When you take guns from them, does crime rate drop? I’d like to see statistics for that.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Thing is, and this isn’t just pointed at you but to anyone pro-gun: If you allow citizens to carry guns, criminals can carry guns too without being arrested, or spotted by those who want a peaceful life. It makes everyone equal, when you don’t really want to. Do you expect a 70 year old lady to shoot the guy who’s mugging her? Do you expect a mother with a young child to shoot a man between the eyes? Do you really think the majority will just pull out their guns and shoot?</p>
<p>What about paranoid people? They’ll shoot you when you make a sudden move.[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s not really allowing everyone to carry guns.  I am talking about only allowing law-abiding citizens to carry guns.  It is already illegal for convicted felons to own guns at all, the point is that they are criminals who break laws for a living, so gun control doesn’t affect them, and only disarms law-abiding citizens, which obviously causes crime to rise.  I expect both of your example cases to happen, a 70 year old lady has just as much of a right to protect herself as anyone else, and without a gun even less of an ability.  And mothers have been known to lift cars to save their children, hell yes they would shoot someone who was trying to kill their kid between the eyes.  I don’t know about the majority, but everyone that does it stops a crime, so any is better than none.  Not to mention just the thought that your victim may be carrying a gun strikes fear in to the heart of criminals, they have said so on record countless times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, mopar why do you carry your gun with you nearly everywhere?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For the protection of myself and others.  I sincerely hope I never have to use my gun against another human being, but if that person is threatening my or someone else’s life, then yes, I will try to the best of my ability to stop it.</p>
<p>Think about the killing at Virginia Tech, one thing the news didn’t cover at all is that out of the first 5 or so people the psycho killed, 2 of them had concealed carry permits, and if it wasn’t for a law saying that concealed carry holders couldn’t carry on campus, the killings may have well stopped right there.  But no, due to gun control laws disarming law-abiding citizens, more than 30 people died needlessly.  Who can say if you will meet a similar psycho when you go out to lunch, the store, or a movie?  I am not going to bet my life or the life of my loved ones on it, would you?</p>

<p>Thing is, and this isn’t just pointed at you but to anyone pro-gun: If you allow citizens to carry guns, criminals can carry guns too without being arrested, or spotted by those who want a peaceful life. It makes everyone equal, when you don’t really want to. Do you expect a 70 year old lady to shoot the guy who’s mugging her? Do you expect a mother with a young child to shoot a man between the eyes? Do you really think the majority will just pull out their guns and shoot?</p>
<p>What about paranoid people? They’ll shoot you when you make a sudden move.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s not really allowing everyone to carry guns.  I am talking about only allowing law-abiding citizens to carry guns.  It is already illegal for convicted felons to own guns at all, the point is that they are criminals who break laws for a living, so gun control doesn’t affect them, and only disarms law-abiding citizens, which obviously causes crime to rise.  I expect both of your example cases to happen, a 70 year old lady has just as much of a right to protect herself as anyone else, and without a gun even less of an ability.  And mothers have been known to lift cars to save their children, hell yes they would shoot someone who was trying to kill their kid between the eyes.[/quote]<br>
He said should the mother kill someone in front of the kid eyes, not that the man tried to kill the kid, but are you meaning we should learn our children that kill people/violence are the best solution to the problems?</p>

<p>Are you serious?  You are saying that we should teach our kids that if someone points a gun at them trying to kill them they should what? Try to find a non-violent solution to the problem?  That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.  When someone puts your life in danger, your choices have been taken away, you can either die, or try to survive.</p>

I said you misunderstood him, he said nothing about the man trying to kill.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you had to shoot one you had the be careful and shooting a NON lethal shot only to show you are serious and to avoid he to do something stupid.</p>

I think they should re-instate the death penalty here in england, the government spend so much money on prisoners and they cant put more people in prison because they’re full the only way is to start killing them. This would also help with controlling the population a bit better as there is always a steady stream of criminals<br>

Two options:</p>

<p>I don’t think the death penalty will prevent crime. Besides, what kind of punishment is that. If I’d have to choose between death or the rest of my life in prison, I’d pick death.</p>
