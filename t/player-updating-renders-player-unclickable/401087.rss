    <title>Player Updating Renders Player Unclickable</title>

    <description>Hello everyone.

I&#39;m working on a RS2 Framework right now, but I have just found a very annoying glitch that I can&#39;t put my finger on, so I was wondering if this had happened to anyone before and they have any tips.

When i&#39;m updating my players so they can see each other, the last player to login can not be right clicked. In a better example, let&#39;s say CharacterA logs in, and afterwards, CharacterB logs in. CharacterA can right click CharacterB, but CharacterB can&#39;t right click CharacterA.

Any tips?

EDIT: Resolved it by figuring out that if a players ID is 0 the player would be unclickable. Made all IDs +1 and it worked perfect.</description>
