    <title>Does any rsc players want a pk server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-any-rsc-players-want-a-pk-server/545308</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve started up this pk server and it seems only a handful have even tried it.  This leads me to believe that rsc players no longer want a pk server??? 
  If this was false,  then what would make a pk server good.  What ideas about the world would people want to see to  play, or even try for this matter.  I&#39;m stumped.</description>

              <p>[quote=“KizL, post:6, topic:545308”]Ok, so on WoW you can Q for Arena battles so 1v1,2v2,6v6 etc well what if we could do the same thing but with RSC? You could use the Castle part of the map as the place where you spawn. (BUT ITS NOT CONNECTED TO THE REAL WILD.) on a server.<br>

<p>This would allow people to have matches and you could have ranked matches even. Would be really cool to rip off WoW for this part. Cause I’d sit and wait for a Q to 6v6 where everyones 9 lvls around each other and the team mates can’t BS.</p>
<p>You can basically keep training and doing what ever until it says “6V6 READY! BEGIN?” click YES when you’re ready then same for everyone else.<br>
Goes on a count down timer after it brings you there from 60secs?</p>
<p>You could also choose “Skull or No Skull” So you wont lose items or you will.</p>
<p>YOU COULD HAVE LOW RATES AND STILL HAVE COOL PK SHIT LIKE THAT ^</p>

              <p>thats what rsc is lol.  except the rates are 30-35x, so you would not have to grind as much as a 3x server. its over 10x faster.  Varrock bank on my server is right toward the edge of the wildernss… its a great spot and i will be developing it more.</p>

Also, my point still stands, there already is a 99-max-stat-replica out there. Pk focused or not, yours is the same concept.</p>

              <p>good though i thought about a point based server.  Some are starting to at least try slay now.  Im thinking im going to turn edgeville into a ghost town and centralize varrock.  This should be fun and interesting as I always loved varrock pking and it will bring a new feel for us RSC players.</p>

              <p>What my thought was, when rscr got started was that someone is surely going to start a points based server.<br>
But that never happened.<br>
Whenever there’s a big replica around, there needs to be a points server around so that people can afk and pk at the same time.</p>
