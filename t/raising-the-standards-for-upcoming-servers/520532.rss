    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/raising-the-standards-for-upcoming-servers/520532</link>
    <description>What happened to servers? It feels like all of the servers out are very lacking of original content and structure. Even most of the forum posts lack proper information and media that presents the server in a way that draws players in. I get that I am just a player and I have no room to rip on people&#39;s abilities to code on servers, however I really do feel like the community is in need of better structure and overall better structured servers. Am I the only one who feels this?</description>

              <p>i agree with this, i remember the first server i played kept me for 2 years because it constantly added new things &amp; pushed the boundaries of fun on an rsps, then they just slacked. someone else said its about " money " and he/she is right, nowadays you have teenagers who invest small amounts in a shitty source, host it &amp; collect profit by selling " staff spots " and other things, 2 months down the road they shut it down because they’ve made enough money, me &amp; a friend launched a server with a pretty unique outlook compared to other servers, after 1 month we didn’t have enough players to keep it stable.</p>

Both. Skilling is utterly underrepresented in nearly every server. However, making the game feel more like survival and adventuring, rather than farming 1 hit KOing everything as fast as you can is a real issue. There is no struggle with monsters and skilling, it is all made for grinding, so owners just boost xp to make the grind less annoying so people don’t quit. This in turn forces people to end the grind and then the game becomes boring.</p>

              <p>Sini has the mindset I’m talking about. Yes original content it great, but I mean the actual representation of the server and the thought process behind most servers are completely lacking. You never see an even half professionally made forum thread on a server. I can understand wanting to make money off of a server, whuch is why my mind is blown by the fact that no one even tries anymore. They grab a piece of crap code, slap their name on it and grab a 420 yolo skin for the inventory background to make people think they made original content, then do a half ass marketing job which rakes in 15 players and then they go “Hm, I wonder why my server won’t pick up more members…”</p>
<p>If people are seriously going to make money off this and make it long term, it’s about damn time that servers were taken seriously and were given at least a shred of thought about what to put into the server itself and its representation to the RSPS community. I’ll be honest, I don’t go to have of your servers because they look shady as love. Owners need to stop looking at what will happen at the beginning, and they need to look forward and see what is required to make long term profit. I fully understand making the first week of release double xp or even triple, but to go “420 yolo pk server, kill for pvp points to unlock gear.  Kill 1 thing for 1m xp so you can pk right away” isn’t going to cut it anymore. People wonder why RSPS is a dying breed, and it’s because people are becoming lazy.</p>
<p>Owners NEED to start doing their job and doing it right, otherwise the community and servers themselves will eventually dwindle into nothingness.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Hadlich</span> original content is great, but in order for that equipment and bosses and items to be used, the entire server surrounding it must be high quality, otherwise the server will just die and the content will be useless. If one wishes for their server to succeed, then they must research on how to present their server in a high quality matter that will answer all basic questions about said server. A proper staff must be in effect or be in the process of becoming fully effect, or any visitors that do join may become abused by the staff and will just leave. My whole point for this thread was to explain that in order for RSPS to survive, a more sensible way of presenting itself to the community must exist and on top of that must present the community with a new and intriguing way of making players view the game in a way that is fresh, new, and will force them to keep coming back.</p>

<p>There were GOOD attempts last year, but you practically have to make a step by step manual for these kids to tell them how to work the software. No one wants to go the full ten yards to make a server that is fully functional, even the ‘greats’.</p>
<p>I suggest to you if you are reading this, if you are a kid who wants to go further with RSPS and seriously make an impact: Read my threads, read my wiki posts, read Silabs threads, read Method’s threads on R-S, read the wiki in general, dissect the history of what has happened in the past few years, dissect sources and their different components, and try just TRY and make something of your own. You will fail the first time. You will fail the second time. You will continue to fail but every failure will get you one step closer to realizing what you want to accomplish. Take this from someone who hasn’t made anything big named for the community but has contributed knowledge on RSPS mechanics over the past few years.</p>

<p>there’s no way to create a ‘better structured server’ as the ones who are fully capable of doing the programming correctly, do not have enough time, finances, or patience to fully add all the content that people desire to be host-ready. as this is called a framework, the kids worry too much about money and do not have the knowledge/time to add content themselves.</p>

              <p>What happened to servers? It feels like all of the servers out are very lacking of original content and structure. Even most of the forum posts lack proper information and media that presents the server in a way that draws players in. I get that I am just a player and I have no room to rip on people’s abilities to code on servers, however I really do feel like the community is in need of better structure and overall better structured servers. Am I the only one who feels this?</p>
