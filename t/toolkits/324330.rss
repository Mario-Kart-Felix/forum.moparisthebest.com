    <title>Toolkits?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/toolkits/324330</link>
    <description>Not 100% sure where to post this. But I figure this is a good place to start.

A while back, maybe a month ago, I seen a post on here with a good little toolkit. It had NPC shop makers, drop makers, npc spawns. I mean... It was a lot of usefull stuff.

And I can&#39;t seem to find it now. =\

If anyone has anything close to this It would be MUCH appreciated as I&#39;m actually working on a server.
I know its possible to do it myself, but these tools do it faster and more accurate.

Thanks,
