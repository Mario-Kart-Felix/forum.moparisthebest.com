    <title>Really tricky problem, Logging in issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/really-tricky-problem-logging-in-issues/453479</link>
    <description>A week ago the server was at a steady 60 players reaching into the 100&#39;s at times witch is a all time best for this summer. And there was a mod that &quot;resigned&quot; and gave out 100k+ PKP (PKP is the servers currency as we are a pking community) witch shit on the economy. So there was a roll back 1 day before the big &quot;give away&quot; occurred. After the roll back we are lucky to have 40 players online at any givin time. The head coder and owner have no idea what is wrong. Some players say the web-client wont load () Some players have error connecting to server while we have 20+ people that have no problem at all  :confused:. Any kind of suggestions you can give me will help. Thank you for your time. Also some players once hit log in it doesnt let them in game just keeps them at the main log in page, but their character logs in but they cannot play on it. Any suggestions will help.</description>
