[/quote]</p>
<p>ive never seen your server, but if i did it would probably be “lame” so don’t talk[/quote]</p>

              <p>highest i had without lag was 152, 155 is when it lagged a bit then people kept saying this server is uncrashable cause 200 nulls just logged in -would make 350 something people but 200 nulls-<br>
so i had 155 REAL players and 200 nulls, then 1 person logged in it crashed and it would never go back up so i quit hosting it ;(<br>
You didnt answer me and xx nub xx, ive never edited drops before</p>

<p>hmm maybe an autospawn generator? just put in the npc ID (or name if you want it to be really good but that would be hard cuz you would have to be able to convert each name into an ID) and the coords… although not really useful for the more advanced people since autospawns are so easy to make… but then again arnt commands and shops? well anyway theres my idea</p>

And a autospawn generator, IDK, Put it in the maybe pile.<br>

hmm maybe an autospawn generator? just put in the npc ID (or name if you want it to be really good but that would be hard cuz you would have to be able to convert each name into an ID) and the coords… although not really useful for the more advanced people since autospawns are so easy to make… but then again arnt commands and shops? well anyway theres my idea<br>

<p>You make a Shop and Command generator, Its harder then you think.<br>
And a autospawn generator, IDK, Put it in the maybe pile.[/quote]</p>
<p>never said a generator wasnt hard… i meant writing the code by hand wasnt too hard if you know what your doing… but these are aimed at beginners no?</p>
