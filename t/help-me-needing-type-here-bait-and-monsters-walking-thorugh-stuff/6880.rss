    <description>Ok.. Well, I talk to the guy in the shop where he is suppose to transport you to that place where you mine runes. well, I try to lak to him and it says I need fly fishing bait or whatver and I try to trade with him and it says I need another bait. How do I fix it so he does what he&#39;s suppose to do?

Also, I have these hob goblins (using TestScape source) walking thorugh my fountain and what not. I&#39;m asking to se if anyone found out which hobgoblin it is (in autospawn.cfg) or how can I make them stop?</description>
