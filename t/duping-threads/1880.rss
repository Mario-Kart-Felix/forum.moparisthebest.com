    <title>Duping Threads</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/duping-threads/1880</link>
    <description>Ok, it appears that everyone is trying to find out their own method of duplicating items in game. However I can tell you now, this is fairly not possible!

Edit the client all you want but you should know this: 

[ul][li]All items are created and deleted via the server. Your client will act upon the server&#39;s items and that is it. You can create things client side, but their isn&#39;t anything in the client that calls the server to create a new item because, the server is the only thing that creates items.[/li]
[li]Duping as of now, is not possible.[/li][/ul]


I hope this clears up most questions :)</description>

<p>You can replicate the “money making process” but all you can change is on the client-side.  The server ultimately controls all the creation of gp.  So basically your client can tell the server whatever it wants, but the server has to agree.  Basically your client would say “Hey server, I just recieved got 100M GPs”, and the server would just say “I didn’t make those gps for you, so you’re full of shit and don’t get gps”.  The method used to dupe in the past basically just confused the server.  If i remember correctly you basically told the server “Hey server, I’m going to trade a stack of 0 pink party hats” and the server said got confused about a stack of 0 pink party hats, and translated it as no party hats being offered by the giver and 1 party hat being traded to the reciever.  The glitch in the server was that it alowed stacks of unstackable items.</p>
