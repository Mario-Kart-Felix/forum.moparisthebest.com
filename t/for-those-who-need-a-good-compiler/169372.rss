    <description>I take no credit for this compiler, i just came across it, and I&#39;m not stealing the creators idea, im promoting it so more people can have it. Please understand. 

If your compiler says: You do not have JDK 5 or JDK 6 go and download from...(blah blah blah). Then this is the compiler for you :

@echo off
COLOR 09
title NigahScape Compile
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_03\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp . *.java
pause

just copy paste that into your compiler.bat file and it should say this : note: stream.java uses overrides a deprecated API.
                                                                                               note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
                                                                                               Press any key to continue . . .

If it says that, dont worry, thats a good thing, it means that your server/source has been compiled. Have fun guys.</description>
