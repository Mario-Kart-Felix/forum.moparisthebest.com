    <title>[error] Connecting to server forever</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server-forever/528191</link>
    <description>I am trying to connect to my friends server but my jar client is just staying on the connnecting to world 1 screen.
I deleted the cache like 5 times re installed his jar client and everything and I still cannot load. 
It does not even say error connecting to server it just stays connecting.
It has been like this for 10 hours so far on the same screen.

I also know its online as my friends are currently playing it.
Its not server sided its definitely my computer.</description>
