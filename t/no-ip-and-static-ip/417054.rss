    <title>No-ip and static ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-ip-and-static-ip/417054</link>
    <description>okay i noticed that my server was connecting to my static ip. in order to portforward my server i have to get a static ip and put that static ip as the lan ip. so instead of connecting to the no -ip it connects to my static ip. and when i try to put my no-ip as the lan it wont let me does this mean i have to use my static ip instead of my no-ip?</description>

              <p>when you sign up for no-ip make sure that you use your static ip for the connection, lots of people make this mistake and put there lan ip which is wrong.</p>
