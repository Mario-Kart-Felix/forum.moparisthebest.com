    <description>hey people

i&#39;m coding rsps servers for a while now but this time i really messed up and i dont know what i even did wrong
here is my story...:

i stopped coding for a month or something when suddenly my boss asked me for a new rsps with a higher revision etc...
so i started a new project but just when i wanted to start with it i was unable to log on to it i tryed it on all my rsps servers even the ones i didn&#39;t touched it  always says the same &quot;no response from server&quot; i had that problem before and i simply solved it with testing all my programs on my computer by turning them off and i found out that µtorrent was blocking the connection between my source and my client so i assumed i had the same problem that i had before so i did my test again but this time i cannot find out whats blocking my rsps to connect to each other if one of you guys had this problem and was able to fix it let me know it in this topic just simply make a post

thanks</description>
