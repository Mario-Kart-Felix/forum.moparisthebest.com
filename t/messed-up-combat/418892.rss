    <title>Messed Up Combat</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/messed-up-combat/418892</link>
    <description>Hey Everyone, I really need help with the combat on a source called project creation I think and he used FormatX V1.
Basically, The combat is really messed up. When you click punch it punches and gives attack exp this is fine, You click kick then it doesn&#39;t kick it carries on punching and giving attack exp, You click block and it still punches giving attack exp. I really need help as this is far to complicated for me as I am a coder who has just recently started.

EDIT: It is alright when wielding a weapon any help please?

Thanks, I Rushed You</description>
