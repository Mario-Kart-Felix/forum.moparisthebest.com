              <p>mouse recording was implemented in 377 iirc, just not use in private servers because who tf cares if someone bots on a private server</p>
<p>as for your ‘notification’ packets or whatever — keyboard is handled via client sided. the packet for the chat is not created/sent until the user hits [enter] and the input follows all given rules. this is how clan chat, public chat, and commands are all different opcode ids.</p>
<p>you can already check for keystrokes (key pressed, key down, key combinations) all previous to the actual ““input string”” as most fudge tards like to refer to it seeing as 377s generally switch tabs with the function keys.</p>
<p>once you check for the shit you want, create the new packet or whatever you want - if it doesnt apply to your check -&gt; continue with the standard chat or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>good luck</p>

Auto typers aren’t allowed on runescape 3… It’s a form of macroing (I’ve been told this by multiple pmods).</p>
<p>The only auto typer allowed is the one they built into the OSRS client or whatever.<br>
And you’re also thinking minuscule again.</p>
<p>I was thinking it’d send a full line of data… Ex:<br>
Every time a player types a letter into the chatbox, the entire chatbox string is sent to the server.</p>
<p>And there’s also this thing where runescape is a big company that has rather powerful servers (Better than vpses you see for a rsps)… So of course they don’t need to worry as much.</p>
<p>Oh, and about the x and y thing. They do have it.</p>

              <p>I have no idea what your looking for could you be a bit more specific?<br>
Anyways:</p>
<p>case 1: you want to use the client to send a packet to the server and cause something to happen you should open up your client and add a key listener that listens for a key combination and then checks if the client is being used on a computer with the mac address listed in a array(a pre approved list of people who can use key combinations) and then send a packet to the server which can<br>
cause just about anything to happen but this would require messing with packets and the stream which is a bit advanced.</p>
<p>case 2: Your hosting the server on a local machine this would be bad in the first place but possible if this is you, you could add a key listener to the server and all that packet nonsense would go away problem is if its ever not hosted on a local machine you may have some issues.</p>

<p>One, that doesn’t exist… And two, have you considered how much stress that can put on the server?<br>
If this is going to be hosted, you should always try and test for scalability (player-wise).<br>
Would your server be able to handle 100 people typing at <a href="http://www.ask.com/technology/good-number-keystrokes-per-hour-b867e7df225eb08c" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">10,000 keystrokes per hour</a>?</p>
<p>You should try to either A) Do this all client sided if no server-verification is needed. B) Send the minimal packets to the server. Make it so it’s only sent after a special key, like enter, is pressed. Or after a button (on screen) is hit, etc.</p>
