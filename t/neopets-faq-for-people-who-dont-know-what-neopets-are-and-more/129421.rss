    <description>Q:[b]What is Neopets?[/b]
A:Neopets is a game where we register a free account and play free games to gain neopoints (Money) and you get your own kind of computer pet which you have to feed and stuff, using the neopoints to buy food and other stuff for your &quot;pet&quot;.
Q:[b]Where can I register a account[/b]
A: www.neopets.com
[b][u]Q:Do I HAVE to feed my neopet?[/u][/b]
A:Yes you do.Once you register it will show the stats of your neopets.
These are mine.

Species: Buzz 
Health: 9 / 9 
Mood: content 
Hunger: dying 
Age: 27 days 
Level: 1

You see Hunger? Well a neopet can die if you don&#39;t feed it,but you can get another one.
[u][b]Q:Can I name my neopet.[/b][/u]
A:Yes you can. Like a nickname. But you will have a username which is different from your nickname,and a password.But I forewarn you don&#39;t make a name like neopets suck or **** you,because they will let you use the name until you have to activate the account using your email and then they will say.Username DENIED.
Its quite annoying because we have to go through a 10-20min account making steps and then at the end it says ACCOUNT DENIED!.</description>

              <p>LOL a neopet cant die and you dont have to feed it, learn before making a FAQ n00b, and what are you talking about on the last one o_O it takes seconds to make an account and  if your username is inapropiate it will not allow you to use it, and there is no such thing as a nickname</p>
