    <description>I want to be able to See my crown, When i compile them they give me 100 errors ... Please give me one with no errors....  Also I want to be able to change Starting Equipment, i can not find where to do it at... And I want to change shop prices.... I don&#39;t know how to do that either o.o.... They really need to arrange the (TUTORIAL LIST) from servers... LIke the ones for Testscape servers in all under the title TESTSCAPE SERVER CODES or something like that...

And yea... I wanna make it so that nobody but the admin will be able to get a phat.... please help me out ...


AND ALSO is it possible to have a code to where only Mod&#39;s and Admin&#39;s can use to Teleport me to Tutorial Island? And like how do i put shops and Items in Tutorial Island?



EDIT: I WANT TO CHANGE STARTING EQUIPMENT NOT INVENTORY!</description>
