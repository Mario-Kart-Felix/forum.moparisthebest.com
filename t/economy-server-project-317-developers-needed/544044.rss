    <description>[center]I&#39;m creating a new Economy server project 317 which needs developers.

The developers which i need is: Graphic design [0/2] Coder[0/2] Website developer [0/2] [Please leave your skype account below, so i could contact you]

Graphic designers - Could design gfx/ be apart of the graphic section on forums.
Coder - Could code new stuff by hands which includes basic things and also adding minigames/bosses and fixing bugs.
Website developer - Could able to fix the website, whenever theres a issue and make some basic scripts for us like highscore and shit and forums.

About us: We were found in 2013 and the project was start back then and was hosted, but suddenly we stopped because of some few RL issues and then we sold the source files for 223$ and then the late 2014 me and my friends started to make it again and this time we were going to make it alive and much powerful with a good economy and this time we wouldn&#39;t give up! ;)

Sponsers: Datacenter located in USA/Norway [They offer us good kind of service, which we need for the server]

Much appericated! ^_^[/center]</description>

Since i stopped coding for bots i realy need a new project to work on.[/quote]</p>
<p>No one is going to want you to develop for their server with grammar like that. RSPSses (really?)</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span> - If you have more than one website developer, there’s going to be problems. Rarely do they work together, they’ll try to compete.</p>
