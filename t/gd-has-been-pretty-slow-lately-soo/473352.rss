I was in this place last month, don’t be such a girl about it. Suck it the love up and go out and enjoy yourself. Mines cheated on me after 2 years and me treating her like an absolute princess. There’s nothing you can do about it so man up and at the very least enjoy yourself. She won’t leave your mind for months and months and when you do go and have sex with random girls you’ll be comparing them to her all the time, there is literally nothing you can do about it.

I think the only thing i have done is college for the last 2 years and its been boring beyond belief.</p>
<p>anyways. i came back to moparscape after i stopped in on moparscape and found servers like drugscape originality are mostly gone… i just love the moparscape community.</p>
<p>something personal? well I am interested in learning all the new things about the community and i hope too talk lots more with everyone.</p>

<p>School life - My grades are slowly decreasing and my teachers are noticing. Almost everyday one of my teachers pull me aside and give me a long-ass lecture on why I shouldn’t fall into a ‘hole’ that I can’t get myself out of. My 6-9th grade years I didn’t care about schoolwork, but as I got older I realized I need to have a good career.</p>

              <p>I had a very busy summer. First I got married to my beautiful girlfried of 4 years and 2 weeks after that I headed off for the United States Air Force. I somehow managed to make it through basic training in San Antonio, Texas. I’m from a very cold climate and the weather there was almost unbearable, there were weeks at a time that it would be over 100 degrees (F).</p>
<p>Anyways, I made it through that and got shipped off to Biloxi, MS to get my technical training to become a 3D0x2, cyber systems operator. What that means in the civilian world is I’ll be a Network Administrator (my dream job!).</p>
<p>As of right now I’m halfway done with tech school. After I come back from Christmas Exodus I’ll have roughly 2 months left. When I finish here I’ll almost have an Associates Degree in Information Technology and I will have a CompTIA Security+ certificate. After I finish up here I’ll be stationed in Northern California. I can’t wait!</p>

              <p>Due to the cold snaps that have been happening a lot through Scotland where we’ve been regularly hitting -5 degrees most nights our turbines have been fucking up a lot due to the temperature changes happening so fast. No-one can really pinpoint the issue but its probably just because we’re ten years behind everyone else environmentally. Also there’s been a lot of people snowed in and such so there’s been a big dip in technicians available so they’ve been making use of the apprentice engineers and even a few fully qualified engineers to take their place. Que where I come in. I’ve been working 11 hour shifts and then remaining on emergency call all night long, it’s really, really shitty. Worth it for the money though.</p>
<p>I’ve also been trying to retain my cup as a complete sleaze when it comes to girls since I’m single again. Got some real catching up to do and get my name back out there :P.</p>
<p>On top of that I’ve got a lot of people wanting to lose weight for Christmas and turning up to the gym a lot more regularly and even a few people have asked me to be a personal trainer which is always extra money. I’ve not had much of a chance to be active on here or even keep up with playing my guitar or piano, everything’s just flooding in at once!</p>
<p>I get 2 weeks off starting Friday though. Because I’m supposed to be attending university more or less full time and they break off I get put on emergency call when we’re on breaks such as the Christmas time break but I almost never get called in so that’s a happy thing to look forward to!</p>
<p>Glad to hear everyone’s having a good time and keeping their lives on track, Merry Christmas to each and every one of you!</p>

              <p>Recently, I have been toying around with videos, dancing, and playing instruments. I’ve been doing this while juggling college and cross country/track so I can say my hands are pretty full with excitement.</p>
<p>I attend Winthrop University and I am a member of the League of Extraordinary Characters which focuses on Anime and comic book (almost specifically Marvel) shows/comics/manga. I’ve made a good amount of friends and life has been good. I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years in June (as some of you may/may not know) and participated in a relationship with one girl I had a crush on in high school for a week. I was extremely happy but I knew she wasn’t ready for a relationship so we broke it off until she was ready. So I’m currently in waiting for that moment. Cross country has put me in great shape in college. We are a Div. 1 school in the Big South conference. We aren’t necessarily the best but the program is exceptional in my eyes. I can’t wait for track season so I can start working towards my goal of sub-1:50 in the 800M. My final grades were B average which is pretty good for me who got C- average grades in high school in all my honors/AP classes… and I just had Deja vu in which I was writing this post.</p>
<p>Anime related:<br>
Here is my current watch list as the winter season (part one) winds down (episode 11-12/24-25s come out next week)<br>

<p>Also, here are some of my goals that I’ve added to my life schedule:<br>
Learn 30 different dances (and possibly more)<br>
Learn at least 5 different instruments.</p>

              <p>Sure, why not.</p>
<p>I’ve been putting a lot more effort into my musical life. Right now, the plan in action is go to college in July and graduate with a BS degree in game simulation and programming, move mid-west, and live making video games. But my friend and I have been writing music together for our band and all the songs we’ve written are very good - so good that I and many other people think we will go far. What might end up happening is if we don’t get signed by the time we graduate, we’d find a place together and I would attend college online vs moving to Phoenix.</p>
<p>Recently I bought a keyboard piano and have been playing that a lot. This girl I’ve liked for quite some time now, who I thought was way out of my league despite her being younger than me, is starting to become my friend and my devious plans to get her to be mine are falling into place. I’ve made her my musical go-to person for when I come up with new stuff on the piano, and it’s only a matter of time before I show her one of (yes, there are multiple) the songs I’ve written about her. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
