    <title>A full tutorial for vista users?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-full-tutorial-for-vista-users/275147</link>
    <description>Titles says it all, i tried google i tried searching the forums with the bar and going through pages and pages but nothing. so if someone has a link or their own tutorial they could post, that would be great! thank you


edit: i used to use windows xp and worked fine, but now that i have vista it doesn&#39;t let anyone log in and i&#39;ve done the best port forwarding that i can on this but nothing works.</description>
