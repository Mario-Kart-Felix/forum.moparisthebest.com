    <description>This is something I wrote as a response to the challenge here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,49550.0.html

In this story, we recall how the great moparisthebest defeated Evil, Inc. by destroying their main subsidiary, Jagex, Ltd. Here we go.

Once upon a time, in a land far, far, away, a champion named moparisthebest came to fight the evils of Evil, Incorporated through their subsidiary, Jagex Ltd. Mopar came in his 1969 muscle car, the Dodge Charger. He drove through the front door of Jagex, Ltd with his mighty hood ornament, simultaneously programming robots to fight the evils of Jagex through their own game. moparisthebest advanced deeper into the realm of Jagex, and met with a level 1 gopher. He cast the mighty &#39;Exhaust Fumes&#39; spell, and the level 1 gopher was defeated. Mopar picked up the drop, a key card which the gopher happened to be carrying for Andrew. Mopar pocketed the key card, and headed towards Andrew&#39;s office.

Meanwhile, in a parallel universe...

Mopar&#39;s bots ravaged through xegaJ headquarters and were met with werdnA&#39;s final defense: 2048 bit RSA encryption. The bots began to brute force the RSA key, but to no avail! werdnA would die of natural causes by the time the key was reached. The Bot Scouts were called in, and explored xegaJ headquarters for the key. They did not find the key, but however, they ran into a level 126 Disgruntled Employee. The Disgruntled Employee teamed up with the Bot Scouts and returned to meet with the other bots. The bots advanced and reached werdnA&#39;s evil throne. However, werdnA could not be defeated as long as his counterpart in the parallel universe, Andrew, remained in power. The bots returned to mopar&#39;s universe and delivered the key. Through deus ex machina, the key happened to be the same in both universes.

Mopar entered Andrew&#39;s chamber and discovered him dead, on his throne. The Jagex cat, Bob, sat on the throne in his place. Mopar threw his wrench at Bob, and Bob exploded, turning into a portal to the other universe. Mopar and his army advanced into the parallel universe and defeated werdnA, with a magic incantation:

[code]new Thread(werdnA).stop();[/code]

All references to werdnA were thus deleted from the pages of history, and he was thrown to the Black Hole by the garbage collector. Mopar duplicated his disk of returning and followed him there. He created a prison, and threw werdnA in the same cell as &#39;Bubba.&#39; Thus, he compensated for the years of torture and despotism werdnA inflicted on the players of RuneScape. Mopar reprogrammed the universe, through another incantation:

[code]Universe.getDefaultUniverse().setRuler(&quot;moparisthebest&quot;);[/code]

And that, my friends, is the story of how the universe turned into a garage.

100% by Aftermath.
Enjoy.</description>
