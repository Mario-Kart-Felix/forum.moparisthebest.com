              <p>ok sorry but you al ldont know what you are talking about. it seems to me none of you know what your talking about the host can log on using the ip dont need to use 127.0.0.1<br>
as long as you change the ip on ur client and server such as 0.0.0.0 or the old ip it was originaly on if you leeched <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  and you port foward correctly you should be fine but if your having problems with this post the type of router you have  and i will give you a link to a video tutorial that will simplify this for you</p>

              <p>I had a problem sorta like this. on the client that you are going to use replace what ever youve put down<br>
eg: “<a href="http://stabface.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">stabface.no-ip.org</a>” with “0.0.0.0”</p>
<p>this worked for me.</p>
<p>im guessing you have not done the port forward right.</p>
<p>1)try the defult gateway etc there are many tuts using this</p>
<p>OR</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>go into controll panel --&gt; Network and sharing center --&gt; view status --&gt; details --&gt; look for your   IPv4 IP Address.<br>
itll be something like 192.168.1.—<br>
the — will be the numbers at the end it.<br>
type 192.168.1.1 in ur browser<br>
apps and gaming<br>
then type the last few number tht you saw on your IPv4 IP address.</li>
</ol>
<p>you will also need to do something with ur firewall to let the connections though i think.</p>
<p>this worked for me, hope it does for you. sorry im not so great with words =p</p>
<p>cheerz</p>

<p>you the hoster right ?</p>
<p>go to your client files to gui</p>
<p>and change it to 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>becuase the hoster can’t go in his no-ip only in 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>but your players who wana play it should to use that no-ip</p>
<p>for example your ip in gui file is<br>
127.0.0.1</p>

              <p>Windows XP - Go to “Start” then go to “Run” Then type in <span class="bbcode-b">Cmd.exe</span>.</p>
<p>Windows 7/Vista - Go to “Start” then type in the little search bar down the bottom and type <span class="bbcode-b">Cmd.exe</span>.<br>

Now type, <span class="bbcode-b">Ipconfig</span>. Now it should look like this</p>

<p>Where it says <span class="bbcode-b">Default Gateway</span> There should be some numbers. Type them in your browser<br>
Now You need to figure this bit out yourself.</p>
<p>Because I’m not sure what router your using and all routers are different, Hope this helped.</p>
