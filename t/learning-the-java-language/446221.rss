    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/learning-the-java-language/446221</link>
    <description>Hey,

I&#39;ve been around here for some months, learned a few things, made some friends, and enjoying it so far.

I have seen people here coding like it&#39;s nothing, they look at the &#39;issue&#39;, think a bit, then solve it without any help at all. What I wonder is, what did they do to achieve that?

Basically, I have absolute zero knowledge about Java, that&#39;s why I am here, to learn.

My goal is to work on my own RSPS someday. And with work I don&#39;t mean the easy things like changing coordinates, adding shops, npc&#39;s, small features, etc. which I can do now.

I would like to do the big stuff, the coding itself.

So, to all the experienced coders here: What did you do when you were at my position: No knowledge of Java in any way, what did you do to learn, where did you start? 

If anyone could give me some tips, or even give me advice on where to start, I&#39;d really appreciate!

Summer holidays are coming and I would like to know alot at the end or during summer. Time is not a problem, I have time enough and I&#39;m willing to learn, no matter how hard it is, or no matter how many people seem to give up at some point.

Best regards,

Derpington</description>

<p>By “bad habit” I guess he was talking about the programming style. You might be interested in reading this: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html</a>. Provided you’re code is readable and consistent in style, it’s not really a problem, but then again sticking to conventions that are used by many people could increase readability. Another thing is that it’s a poor example. Write something more meaningful. I can’t comment on how useful Bucky’s tutorials are since I haven’t seen them, but I suggest using additional resources to learn Java. reallybigindex, for example.</p>

              <p>If I were to give you one recommendation it’d be just to think of a project that you’re interested in and won’t drop it with no reason. Just go for it and whenever you get stuck just refer to relative documentation and google for support, then read it and fully understand what you’re implementing.</p>
<p>Also don’t forget you won’t just pick up the language instantly, stick with it, learn it properly and don’t over challenge yourself straight away as it’s a nice way to loose interest.</p>

              <p>The way I learned was almost entirely through experience. I started writing C++ when I was 11 with my cousin using a really old Visual C++ IDE, and then I got into RSPS. I noticed Java was a lot like C++ in the way it ended “lines” with semicolons, used parenthesis, used curly brackets, had very similar type names, etc… I didn’t understand half of the stuff I was doing, but I’d still add content from tutorials and looking at what the server already had, like how adding a shop usually required 3 lines and a “wanneShop” check. Over time, I learned why things happened and was eventually able to write my own code. I never read a single tutorial on learning a language.</p>

<p>Also, I would like to make some sort of ‘remake’ in the future… Like, you start of @ tut island, you have to make your way through, etc. The main thing I want to focus on is making dialogues and stuff, cause i’d love to make (working) quests.</p>
<p>Apart of the tips you guys gave me, is it an option to start off with some client and source, and then look into the code itself to see what everything does, etc. ? I think i’ll understand it better that way and it keeps me motivated. But maybe that’s not a good idea after all, that’s why I am asking right now :&gt;</p>

              <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I’ve been around here for some months, learned a few things, made some friends, and enjoying it so far.</p>
<p>I have seen people here coding like it’s nothing, they look at the ‘issue’, think a bit, then solve it without any help at all. What I wonder is, what did they do to achieve that?</p>
<p>Basically, I have absolute zero knowledge about Java, that’s why I am here, to learn.</p>
<p>My goal is to work on my own RSPS someday. And with work I don’t mean the easy things like changing coordinates, adding shops, npc’s, small features, etc. which I can do now.</p>
<p>I would like to do the big stuff, the coding itself.</p>
<p>So, to all the experienced coders here: What did you do when you were at my position: No knowledge of Java in any way, what did you do to learn, where did you start?</p>
<p>If anyone could give me some tips, or even give me advice on where to start, I’d really appreciate!</p>
<p>Summer holidays are coming and I would like to know alot at the end or during summer. Time is not a problem, I have time enough and I’m willing to learn, no matter how hard it is, or no matter how many people seem to give up at some point.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Derpington</p>
