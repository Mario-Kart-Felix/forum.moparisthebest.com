<p>You might do your job fine over here, but personally if any merge happens I’d just prefer your style of moderation to not be available to you over all the community. tL brushed the surface of it - Over here on mscp you’re all too easy to jump to the conclusion “Arguements are bad, they lead to trolling and flaming”, on the other side of the community we may argue but atleast 90% of the time it has some constructive points in the heart of it. If you were to take your style of moderation over there you’d just kill it.</p>
<p>You do your job fine over here, as of recently I’ve browsed this side of the site and although still rife with absolute fuckwits the site has actually gone forward due to committed members and staff. Just don’t try repeat it over on mitb.[/quote]</p>

[/quote]It would be the same active members that are here at MoparScape (which is what I emphasized…) so why would that change anything… You’re forgetting the reason we’re even thinking of doing this is because you guys already killed yourselves. If we were to merge I don’t think the 20 active MITB members wanting more lax moderation would be the reason we would forgo the rest of the forum having any moderation  :rolleyes: And no, people can still have arguments here as long as it’s civil. I kinda doubt any of you really know just how lax we are, to be honest[/quote]</p>
<p>this is why i dislike the idea. newer members (like yourself, no offence), simply don’t value the mitb members. probably because they’ve all started off on this side of the fence.</p>

        <blockquote>Are you saying MITBers deserve more 'value' than Moparscape members? I understand they have seniority, but respect/value is earned, not acquired over time (especially in your case)...</blockquote>
<p>It seems as though the attitude towards the remaining mitb is that we’re hugely expendable. Considering it was us on that side of the community contributed the most and helped maintain the scene, i do believe we’re entitled to be put one notch above Moparscape members. The separation of the two communities was made because we got tired of idiots filling up the board with stupidity. I don’t see much improvement when i look over the current threads here. Trust me, i was there.</p>
<p>Somewhere in this thread someone said that if we lose the few remaining mitb members, ‘so be it’. That’s what I’m mainly referring to. This widespread new attitude towards the long-term members who stuck it out.</p>
<p>Now before you point out that the threads are only a small amount more informative than those here, it’s important to understand that we function a little differently.</p>
<ol>
<li>We communicate with each other in a way that discourages spoonfeeding. While here, it’s the opposite.</li>
<li>Staff over there have many years in the scene. They understand the right levels of moderation when dealing with a knowledgeable member base.</li>
<li>The community over there is half IRC, half forums. This however, doesn’t mean we don’t value the forums as a great place to store all our findings.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t appreciate the little dig either. I had my time when i was respected. Those members are long gone and replaced. I haven’t thrown any personal insults at you, so i expect the same courtesy.</p>
<blockquote>Sure, a lot of them deserve respect for what they've done for the community, but if you look, most of those people agree with the merge.

<p>The ‘elitist’ ones are the only ones who did care about the community once upon a time. We’re the lot who carried over to here when Kaits closed. Without that intellectual group of members crossing over to make this community worthwhile, i doubt this side would have been as successful as it is now. Personally, i care about the community loads. I’ve been around for a long, long time. It would be a shame to see the scene die, considering i grew up along side it.</p>
<p>You have to understand that we only have this attitude because we constantly see new hordes of idiots arriving, every few months. Contributions decrease and spoonfeeding roams free. Then we have the new staff members who try make a change and become even more ego inflated than myself. No, I’m not referring to you or Taharok. You two have made some nice improvements overall. So credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>I don’t expect my opinion to be really supported, simply because everyone here is too fresh or doesn’t care too much about all of this because of the past where making improvements never really eventuated into anything. Or tired of hearing me rant on about this magical scene and my retelling of old stories, which just seems like I’m masturbating my ego with each word. One of the three. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I just think all this is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Either way, we’re just going to bang heads on this topic and be at constant disagreement. We have two separate and hugely different views on how the community should be, so I’ll simply agree to disagree. Perhaps a fresh prospective may bring a positive change, who knows.</p>

        <p>The biggest problem with merging the two sites is the fact that they both have almost separate identity in the community, MITB is the older area that is more based on programming and runescape hacking, while moparscape is more based on the younger area as in servers for profit and less on hacking, yes we edit the clients and servers, but we don’t really have these big discussions on our hacking finds from runescape… Which adds up to two almost different personality’s that make it very hard to do such a thing. Rant, non scene, just a bunch of words that most likely mean nothing to anyone.</p>
<p>Really what should be done as I already suggested is just consolidate duplicates, like have the general programming redirect to MITB general programming, we don’t really need it and if we do why not just go to MITB where we can get help from some of the more so called “elitist” members.</p>

The moderation is also as such, it has nothing to do with a ‘knowledgeable’ member base, it’s just the way that side of the community has been run, I personally think the loose moderation may be part of the reason nobody new often wants to post anymore.</li>

I just happen to know a little bit about you and your personality, and personally I don’t think you should ‘deserve’ more respect that Moparscape vets just because you may have been here longer.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The ‘elitist’ ones are the only ones who did care about the community once upon a time. We’re the lot who carried over to here when Kaits closed. Without that intellectual group of members crossing over to make this community worthwhile, i doubt this side would have been as successful as it is now. Personally, i care about the community loads. I’ve been around for a long, long time. It would be a shame to see the scene die, considering i grew up along side it.</p>
<p>You have to understand that we only have this attitude because we constantly see new hordes of idiots arriving, every few months. Contributions decrease and spoonfeeding roams free. Then we have the new staff members who try make a change and become even more ego inflated than myself. No, I’m not referring to you or Taharok. You two have made some nice improvements overall. So credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>I don’t expect my opinion to be really supported, simply because everyone here is too fresh or doesn’t care too much about all of this because of the past where making improvements never really eventuated into anything. Or tired of hearing me rant on about this magical scene and my retelling of old stories, which just seems like I’m masturbating my ego with each word. One of the three. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I just think all this is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Either way, we’re just going to bang heads on this topic and be at constant disagreement. We have two separate and hugely different views on how the community should be, so I’ll simply agree to disagree. Perhaps a fresh prospective may bring a positive change, who knows.[/quote]Maybe all of these years in isolation has lead you to forget that the Moparisthebest forum are <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">dead</span></span>. You take credit for birthing us, but how many of you actually came to Moparscape to lead an active community here? Hardly any that are here now, and the ones that stayed there managed to kill off the majority of activity that was left on MITB in due time. At least half of the activity there now are people who came from Moparscape, you could even say that Moparscape is the resurrecting breath of Moparisthebest now. People are going over on their own, and you guys tend to treat them like shit, which is why you aren’t growing. So here’s what I see: you guys are content in your own tight knit little group of fun times and witty replies, which is why you openly try to humiliate people that may not be as knowledgeable as you. It’s a toxic environment for growth, and if you <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> cared about the growth of Moparisthebest, you’d realize it shouldn’t be that way. We should all be one community, not one community of Moparscapers and another community of ‘MITBers’ that dislike the other people…</p>
<p>[quote=“Jmood, post:224, topic:445369”]The biggest problem with merging the two sites is the fact that they both have almost separate identity in the community, MITB is the older area that is more based on programming and runescape hacking, while moparscape is more based on the younger area as in servers for profit and less on hacking, yes we edit the clients and servers, but we don’t really have these big discussions on our hacking finds from runescape… Which adds up to two almost different personality’s that make it very hard to do such a thing. Rant, non scene, just a bunch of words that most likely mean nothing to anyone.</p>
<p>Really what should be done as I already suggested is just consolidate duplicates, like have the general programming redirect to MITB general programming, we don’t really need it and if we do why not just go to MITB where we can get help from some of the more so called “elitist” members.[/quote]That’s why we should be trying to fix it, not resigning to the fact that ‘oh, its MITB full of knowledgeable but rude people, we should stay away’. Your reasoning is the exact same reason I was originally against this idea, but I think Taharok’s/tL’s ideas are sound:<br>
Remerge all non-rsps related discussion from Moparscape (including graphics, general programming, general discussion, etc) back to MITB, but blur the line between the two sites so people don’t feel like it’s two different communities.</p>

        <blockquote>i do believe we're entitled to be put one notch above Moparscape members</blockquote>
<p>You do say a lot of stupid things. You’re probably more at home over here if what you say about the differences between MoparScape and Moparisthebest are true (probably isn’t).</p>
<hr>
<p>As for moderation. I do think MITB side has it right, and I think the moderation style over here, and it hasn’t changed much from when I started as a MoparScape Mod through to a Global Mod, there is something about forcing rules and attitudes on to a user base it simply does not suite.</p>
<p>Moderation of such forums shouldn’t be strict, it should be fluid in forming around the community. There is still this idea that the moderators are somehow of better judgement than the community at large (stuff like this is very common: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,549428.msg4027738.html#msg4027738" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,549428.msg4027738.html#msg4027738</a>), and I don’t blame any individuals, or even any of the moderators at the moment, it seems to be a natural step to subconsciously adopt this attitude whenever anyone gets power over here, it was like that when I was moderator, and I was guilty of it too.</p>
<p>The rules on this side of the site only serve as frustrations, people are always trying to prevent things before they happen, or make very reactionary changes based on a small number of people, affecting the rest of the community negatively. The reason why Moparisthebest started to die off is the same reason Moparscape has lost an absolutely massive chunk of traffic, it used to be the biggest by quite a bit, now you have sites spawned by rejects of this site taking over this site in massive numbers traffic wise.</p>
<p>Stagnation in the scene and specifically the community, moparisthebest members lost interest in the primary subject of the site.</p>
<p>AND for Moparscape: as much as we like to berate these other communities by attracting members from Moparscape to their site with offers of looser rules, that is seemingly what members want.</p>
<p>MITB would have been <span class="bbcode-b">killed instantly</span> if moderation like is found over here was implemented over there, It would not have helped in the slightest. If people were as relaxed, not thinking about rules they didn’t need to think about constantly, not having their topics locked because a moderator ‘didn’t think there was anything to discuss’.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">You are moderators, not content curators. Let the community decide what is good content or not by posting in it. You should only be there to enforce the serious stuff, things that absolutely need moderating. The current way moderation is handled leaves perfectly legitimate content in the hands of moderators who are there to decide if it is good or not, which is absolutely terrible.</span></p>
<p>The elitism in Moparscape is probably bigger than it has been at moparisthebest for a long time, and that is because of this idea that certain people know what is best for the community over the actual community.</p>
<p>tl;dr - moparscape moderators get far too involved in things they shouldn’t. Many suggestions over the past few weeks have also looked to extend this sort of hold over what the community is by Moparscape moderators, and I think if it continues, that will be the death of this community. All these ideas of sweeping changes across the site won’t be much good if you cannot address this fundamental problem.</p>

        <p>That’s what the report system is for mate, and it’s how we find the majority of things to moderate (lock, delete, or whatever). It’s used to point out what people don’t want here in the community, which for the most part is things like spam. Whether or not it fits one persons definition of spam is irrelevant, but when a topic or post gets reported by multiple people there is obviously something wrong. The standards (and average user age/intelligence) here and at MITB are very different, and it’s the <span class="bbcode-i">only</span> reason that style of moderation works there. To be specific, it matches exactly up with ‘letting the community decide’ what good content is, the common sense (or lack thereof) tends to be much different than the average MITB’er, and quite frankly you guys just don’t have to deal with all of the shit that Moparscape members throw at us.</p>
<blockquote>You are moderators, not content curators. Let the community decide what is good content or not by posting in it. You should only be there to enforce the serious stuff, things that absolutely need moderating. The current way moderation is handled leaves perfectly legitimate content in the hands of moderators who are there to decide if it is good or not, which is absolutely terrible.</blockquote>The actions of a single user should not reflect that of the community, someone posting something they find interesting or relevant doesn't mean everyone else does as well. I think you'll actually find it a relatively rare occurrence for something to be removed because a staff member thinks it is 'bad', without the majority of the community thinking so as well. An exception I can think of is when many people were pushing for 'account recovery' (which is stealing accounts that don't belong to you using the RS recover system, just in case you didnt know) to be a legitimate practice here at MPSC, but MITB overruled everyone based on the standards of the site. And so really, if you're trying to push for less moderation, you should be pushing for a 'standards change' instead.

<p>FYI I’ve been classed as elitist since <span class="bbcode-b">ever</span>. You don’t quite understand how we work over at mitb, we don’t simply just hate everyone from mscp - we judge whoever comes over by their actions. If you come over to mitb, talk like a moron, act like a moron (ask questions and don’t research before hand), type like a moron consistently or be Frell. THEN you can get the fuck out and we’re “against” them.</p>
<p>I’m saying to an extent we do deserve a bit more loose moderation, nothing more. We’ve been around years, before you and 99% of your moderation staff - we ourselves know how to act, and if you look back through most posts you’ll find although a lot will be for you, punishable.It’s the general norm over on our side of the site.</p>

so this is why you keep mscp sections over at mscp and everything that doesn’t have to do with rsps over at mitb. you’d move ‘General Category’ and ‘Veteran Talk’ over to mitb.</p>
<p>alternatively, you could partition mitb up in such a way where mscp stuff is clumped together.</p>

        <p>Well I have to agree with tL here more than anyone else. I’ll admit I didn’t thoroughly read over every post, but either way. Our job is to simply make sure this forum succeeds mechanically and structurally. Whether that requires updating the rules based on what the community wants or creating new boards to suit new interests. Our jobs are to encourage people to follow the rules and to ease into the community. Beyond helping users get used to this community, our job has little left. We ban people that disrupt others and warn people who seem to be on that track. Our jobs are supposed to go no further than curbing people’s behavior in a way that reflects the better interests of the community, not the staffs.</p>
<p>The reason this board exists is to try and encourage this philosophy more. The staff do not know what’s best for the site, we simply have the decision powers. I would say staff members have no other power at this community other than making decisions that affect everyone else (because in reality, we’re just on an internet forum, we have no real “power” over people). Yet, making decisions has an impact on thousands of members. Having proper judgement and a clear head is extremely important when making those decisions. If for no other reason, that’s probably the greatest criteria I look for when choosing moderators.</p>
<p>There are times when the staff’s opinions do not reflect the community’s. In extreme cases, we must say no to a certain suggestion simply because not all the users at this community can see the entire scope of what’s going on (another important aspect of staff here). The most difficult part of being staff is figuring out where to draw the line. In fact, the way some moderators deal with users is much different than others. This often causes great distress in the community and can lead to even bigger issues. Nevertheless, it’s times like this when we have to sit down and again reflect the reason why we are here and why we are giving our time to this community.</p>
<p>I respect every single opinion of every member on this forum. My volunteered time at this site is used to make decisions and make sure other decisions don’t cause issues. I have no magic list of things I want the community to believe or think and I do not spend my time shoving it down their throats. This may have been a popular practice a few years ago, but that’s not how we do things anymore. There are still times when a moderator’s decision is questionable, but we deal with it, learn from it, and eventually move on. After all, the staff is just a panel of normal members who have the unfortunate expectations of the community to make decisions that reflect their better interests. At least, that’s the idea.</p>
<p>Edit: After reflecting a bit, I missed one of the most key components of being a staff member. Our job is to make decisions, but it’s also to help users. We should essentially strive for a better community by first trying to help people on our own. We can’t help every user, but we can make a valiant effort to try. Tasks as simple as replying to every topic posted in this section or replying to every private message received is a fantastic start. Every little effort by both the staff and the general community helps improve the community and keep it alive for as long as possible.</p>

</aside>
<p>You do say a lot of stupid things. You’re probably more at home over here if what you say about the differences between MoparScape and Moparisthebest are true (probably isn’t).</p>
<hr>
<p>As for moderation. I do think MITB side has it right, and I think the moderation style over here, and it hasn’t changed much from when I started as a MoparScape Mod through to a Global Mod, there is something about forcing rules and attitudes on to a user base it simply does not suite.</p>
<p>Moderation of such forums shouldn’t be strict, it should be fluid in forming around the community. There is still this idea that the moderators are somehow of better judgement than the community at large (stuff like this is very common: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,549428.msg4027738.html#msg4027738" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,549428.msg4027738.html#msg4027738</a>), and I don’t blame any individuals, or even any of the moderators at the moment, it seems to be a natural step to subconsciously adopt this attitude whenever anyone gets power over here, it was like that when I was moderator, and I was guilty of it too.</p>
<p>The rules on this side of the site only serve as frustrations, people are always trying to prevent things before they happen, or make very reactionary changes based on a small number of people, affecting the rest of the community negatively. The reason why Moparisthebest started to die off is the same reason Moparscape has lost an absolutely massive chunk of traffic, it used to be the biggest by quite a bit, now you have sites spawned by rejects of this site taking over this site in massive numbers traffic wise.</p>
<p>Stagnation in the scene and specifically the community, moparisthebest members lost interest in the primary subject of the site.</p>
<p>AND for Moparscape: as much as we like to berate these other communities by attracting members from Moparscape to their site with offers of looser rules, that is seemingly what members want.</p>
<p>MITB would have been <span class="bbcode-b">killed instantly</span> if moderation like is found over here was implemented over there, It would not have helped in the slightest. If people were as relaxed, not thinking about rules they didn’t need to think about constantly, not having their topics locked because a moderator ‘didn’t think there was anything to discuss’.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">You are moderators, not content curators. Let the community decide what is good content or not by posting in it. You should only be there to enforce the serious stuff, things that absolutely need moderating. The current way moderation is handled leaves perfectly legitimate content in the hands of moderators who are there to decide if it is good or not, which is absolutely terrible.</span></p>
<p>The elitism in Moparscape is probably bigger than it has been at moparisthebest for a long time, and that is because of this idea that certain people know what is best for the community over the actual community.</p>
<p>tl;dr - moparscape moderators get far too involved in things they shouldn’t. Many suggestions over the past few weeks have also looked to extend this sort of hold over what the community is by Moparscape moderators, and I think if it continues, that will be the death of this community. All these ideas of sweeping changes across the site won’t be much good if you cannot address this fundamental problem.[/quote]</p>

        <p>Unlike tL I think moparscape HAS become more lax on rules and I even think the age group has risen some, especially since the introduction of the general discussion boards. What goes on in the moparscape general boards is not much different from mitb general boards.</p>
<p>If the forums merged, then imo some moparscape mods should become full global mods, and some could be sectional moparscape mods. I highly doubt they will become nazi’s looking to infract mitb’ers any chance they can. There’s just as many assholes over here, who remain posting today.</p>
<p>Current global mods are not very active, such as myself, we’d need moparscape mods to continue moderating general discussion etc(as they do now). If you want to merge, then it has to be done this way.</p>
