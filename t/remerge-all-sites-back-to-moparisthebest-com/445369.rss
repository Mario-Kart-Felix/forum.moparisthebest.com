              <p>This has been a massively discussed topic. We have spent many hours going over what to do about this idea. The consensus between what we came up with and what the rest of the administration decided is before your eyes on the board index. There are more infrastructure changes planned besides what was implemented with the boards, so expect a few more possible changes.</p>
<p>As to a full merge, that has been decided against and will not happen. Moparisthebest and MoparScape are simply considered separate communities in every way possible, minus the shared accounts. That is how it will be for now on. If you want private server development, you go here. If you want RuneScape hacking, you go to <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a>.</p>
<p>This topic is resolved.</p>

<p>Every modification done to this forum has significant implementation time. Moparisthebest must setup a temporary forum with the same configurations as this forum, install the custom mod (either through the installer or, more likely, by hand) and then test everything to make sure nothing broke.

<p>Because of this, we batch together features that are requested for several months and try to install them all in one go.

<p>I realize that. I wasn’t trying to hurt anyone’s feelings. I was giving him an idea of how long a move of this magnitude can take.</p>

<p>I could pull a jagex and say that the number of people that post in this section and, in this exact topic, relative to the number of active and partially active users and guests in this community is rather small. In fact, so small that it’s almost not worth considering the opinions of this topic. To be even more of an asshole, there is no concise decision agreed upon in this topic. Disregarding staff posts, the users have been arguing quite a bit about what the best course of action is and no one seems to really know.</p>
<p>Now not being an asshole, given that this is such a massive change with little benefits, we are looking into better solutions (such as cookie sharing, board redirections, and board/category sharing). We have specific goals for each part of this community and these ideas luckily coincide with those goals well.</p>

              <p>To be fair, elve age was correct in locking the topic. There have been many threads about religion, and while his reasoning was wrong (the potential for an argument to break out is not a reason to lock a topic), it would have been better to just link to an older topic/merge the topics and have it continue there. If the same topic would have been made on MITB, I think I can say with a bit of certainty it would have been locked as well. There are many topics discussing religion there, and this one would have just been spammed, taken off topic, and then locked anyways.</p>
<p>Also, MITB has an actual discussions &amp; debates section, so in this example you cannot compare the two. I personally think MPSC should have a D&amp;D board as well, so that people can argue (civilly, mind you) without fear of being infracted for it.</p>

We just set up simple rules that prevent that such thing happens. With a set of standards that the mods must work from we can avoid unnecessary locking of threads. Or we could demote/warn mods that is abusing their powers.</p>
