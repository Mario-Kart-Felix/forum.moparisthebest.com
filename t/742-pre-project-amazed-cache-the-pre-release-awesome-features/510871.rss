I will be updating this thread mostly daily to check on the current status of A to F. I will also spend my time checking it if the link works and if people are being rude. My cousin Carlos, spend the time coding this with my cousin Hector so please don&#39;t abuse this and say it is completely your because it really isn&#39;t. My Cousin Carlos said i can release this because he ISN&#39;T COMPLETELY FINISHED  but it doesn&#39;t have all the Cache Packed in 742. He also told me to give him credits and his brother: Hector if your going to use this. Thanks and i hope you people find this useful as usual this isn&#39;t the final cache he isn&#39;t done he said the next cache will take at least 2 days if not 3 days, so this is more of a pre-beta cache he forgot to add some content i don&#39;t understand because it is JAGEX Talk. Again thanks for clicking the thread, it means a lot.

[size=18pt]I GIVE PERMISSION TO RELEASE ON ANY OTHER WEBSITE: GIVE ME AND MY COUSINS CREDIT[/size]

 Your [Matrix, zenith, pvp, rune-evo, nr v1,v2,v3,v4, etc.] Source must also have cache in their source if not your Source isn&#39;t workable. This might work for the following revisions: 718, 667, 735, 742, 745, 721, 724.

<p>from my point of view the owner of moparscape has no idea wtf runescape is talking and is repeating what he says and makes Jagex get mad and repaets what his is doing wrong.</p>
<p>And between this webite is a copyright since all this is Runescape and Jagex Ltd owns the sources since they developed “agliity, dung, summ, atk, str, etc.”</p>

Nothing. He’s just advertising his development thread that he - which he made very clear - doesn’t want us to post on because of his superiority.</p>

<p>I will be updating this thread mostly daily to check on the current status of A to F. I will also spend my time checking it if the link works and if people are being rude. My cousin Carlos, spend the time coding this with my cousin Hector so please don’t abuse this and say it is completely your because it really isn’t. My Cousin Carlos said i can release this because he ISN’T COMPLETELY FINISHED  but it doesn’t have all the Cache Packed in 742. He also told me to give him credits and his brother: Hector if your going to use this. Thanks and i hope you people find this useful as usual this isn’t the final cache he isn’t done he said the next cache will take at least 2 days if not 3 days, so this is more of a pre-beta cache he forgot to add some content i don’t understand because it is JAGEX Talk. Again thanks for clicking the thread, it means a lot.</p>
