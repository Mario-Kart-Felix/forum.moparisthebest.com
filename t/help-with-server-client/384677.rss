    <title>Help with server/client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-server-client/384677</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;m not going to lie.. I&#39;m pretty noobish at coding, I can do the easy stuff like changing home and all that commands,item stats,drops, ect.
I just need some help with learning how to fix bugs, change the Jad waves/How to add a decent godwars, and I have this bug with my &quot;Shark&quot; food, I have looked at all the tuts and found a couple but none seem to work, please if your willing to help via team-viewer or even just explaining pm me on here :D It would be greatly appreciated, and I would rep, give co-owner on server, even possibly pay you :D Thank You for the time reading this short topic.

EDIT: DELTA BASE
