    <description>I can&#39;t seem to find the code that sends other players to the client.  I need this because I am fixing the teleport bug where if you teleport and do not leave a map area to other players you do not move. (The client and server become out of sync) There is a simple fix and that is to remove the player from all clients and re-create it. Thats why I need to know where the code is that sends out players.  :D</description>
