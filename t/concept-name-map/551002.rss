    <title>Concept Name: Map?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/concept-name-map/551002</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m trying to create a type of bitmap, for a map system. I&#39;m just wondering if bitmap would be the best name for it.

Let&#39;s say you had the following tiles
[code]
0: sand
1: water
2: grass
[/code]

I&#39;m arranging them in a grid, like so:
[code]
11111111
10000001
10000001
10022001
10022001
10222201
10000001
11111111
[/code]

That maps the image of that tile, to a place on the map. What would a better name for the &quot;grid&quot; be? Is grid sufficient?</description>

<p>That was one example. Another one could be, if there are seasons, maybe change the palette just slightly so that instead of grass, there’s snow. Everything else is the same, but now instead of grass, there’s snow. As for the example you gave, that’s handled by the new tile map. something like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">id: area_default
00000000
01111110
01111110
01111110
01111110
01111110
01111110
00000000
palette: {
    0: grass
    1: water
}</code></pre>
<p>and then</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">map_id: area_after_event
00000000
00000000
00000000
00110000
00110000
00100000
00000000
00000000
palette: {
    0: dirt
    1: dirty water
}</code></pre>
<p>or even</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">map_id: area_after_event
00000000
00300220
00000000
00011000
00011000
00000000
03000220
00000000
palette: {
    0: dirt
    1: dirty water
    2: cracked rock
    3: human skull

<p>For maps that do physically change (that is, the tile map changes), there does need to be a new map. But for things like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">0000000000000000
0000000000000000
1111110000000000
2222210000000000</code></pre>
<p>with palette</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">0: grass
1: sand
2: water</code></pre>
<p>after a catastrophic event, like significant drought, the map would stay the same</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">0000000000000000
0000000000000000
1111110000000000
2222210000000000</code></pre>
<p>but the palette would be changed to</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">0: rock
1: dirt
2: sand</code></pre>
<p>each tile map would be unique though; so if you wanted to replace everything in this region with dirt, it would be better (and in fact, with my system, required) to change the tile map to</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">0000000000000000
0000000000000000
0000000000000000
0000000000000000</code></pre>
<p>and, you would need to specify a new palette (tilemap)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">0: dirt</code></pre>
<p>To ensure consistency, I think I might reject discrepancies with different numbers of unique tiles, and tiles on the map; meaning that if there are 20 different tiles used in the map, and only 3 different tiles in the palette, the map will fail to load. Or, conversely, if there are 3 tiles used in the map, and 20 different tiles in the palette, maybe a warning, or reject it as well.</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/sini">@sini</a> and Lin: That’s kinda of what I’ve been doing so far. I’ve been calling or a palette though. So each tile has a color palette and color map, so that the sprite can have different color combinations, but same design. From there each map region has a tile map and tile palette and follows the same pattern; you could have a map with water and and grass, and then after a certain point in the game, when the player walks through the map, they recognize the buildings, so they recognize the area, but all of the water has been replaced with sand, and all grass with dirt. And then maybe the player does something else in the game, and it’s been restored.</p>

TileMap though is a better name. How many bits of information are your storing per tile?</p>
