    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-webclient-please-can-someone-help-me/506650</link>
    <description>hello,

I am finished with coding my server and I wanted to make a webclient.
I made an application from my client, but if I wanna play it, it gives an error: [i]Error: Invalid or corrupt jarfile C:\Users\Kids\Desktop\application.jar[/i]
I have a signed file of it, and if I double klick that nothing happen.
I have also made a webclient already but if you wanna play it it says: 
[i][b]ClassformatError[/b]
incompatible magic value 1008813135 in class file client[/i]
wat should I do so it work?</description>
