    <title>Making shops to where you cant sell back to them</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-shops-to-where-you-cant-sell-back-to-them/447781</link>
    <description>ive noticed in my PI server that when i have 2+ of an item that i can sell by the 100 and itll multiply 1 item sale and still sell 1 item but give you lets say 3x - 27x the cash you sold 1 for. 

i couldnt find a fix because im not very good at that kind of crap, so i went in and made an easy fix to make it impossible to sell to all stores. for some reason the melee shop and the general store you can still sell to after i put their shop ids into unsellable shops section. very confused, tell me how to fix.

also even changed the npc shop traders and what not, and the shop ids of them and it didnt work. love some help on the best way to fix this dupe.</description>

              <p>thats what im saying anything related to shops is what ive already tried and done… so i dont know what else to look into from there along the lines of fixing the shops from being able to buy what players sell.</p>
<p>if your advice was on the buy 100 then it definitely wouldnt help</p>

              <p>On delta it is a matter of changing one number in the shops.cfg, you should look around where shops are handled for any numbers such as 1’s, try changing them to 2’s? If everything else fails, just look for the void where the shops are called and look into it from there.</p>
