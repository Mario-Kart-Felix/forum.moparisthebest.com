    <title>Kalphite Queen?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kalphite-queen/319666</link>
    <description>Um I have this problem with The Kalphite Queen

Once your at her lair and you beat her first form, she goes into her secound form AND THERES NO WAY TO ATTACK HER!
It has a messgae that appears everytime you attack her and she just keeps attacking you. Anyone know how to fix this?
Any help will be apreciated.

-thanks
