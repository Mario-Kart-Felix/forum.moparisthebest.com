    <description>I was scrolling through the MSN news and found this!

http://money.msn.com/shopping-deals/article.aspx?post=3e3adf27-dfba-4999-981d-078c642e0886&amp;gt1=33029

<p>That is a terrible measure of value. In order to really get a value of something, we need to consider how much money we can get out of it.</p>
<p>Let say I sell you a barrel of oil for $150, you agree with my trade. Does your barrel of oil have a value of $150? No, the value of your barrel is still $110.<br>

Wrong… Money is just there to make exchange easier. If someone is willing to spend $150 on a barrel of oil, then that barrel of oil is worth $150. It doesn’t mean that the other ones are, but that one definitely is.[/quote]<br>
Another stupid boy. If you can’t sell the barrel to anyone else for $150, it isn’t worth $150.<br>
Let me give you another example. Somebody sells you a barrel of oil for $70. Do you now have a barrel worth $150 and one worth $70? It makes no sense.</p>
<p>And to make the case much more insane. I sell you a $10 bill for $20. Would the bill double in value because you bought it for $20?</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly Mac Pro’s are stupidly more expensive then a home built counterpart and as with any Apple product, you ain’t going to be able to replace/upgrade it cheap…</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually, Mac Pros are very upgradable. The chassis was actually designed to be rather friendly to upgrades, it is rather nice. Though, Apple have refused to upgrade the Mac Pros for a while now, yet haven’t dropped the price so they are ridiculously overpriced. But I imagine that is because they’re a rather niche product.</p>

<p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:11, topic:462217”]European farmers had to get rid of pigs because it got to expensive to feed them. This again gave a 10% decrease in supply, and the bacon prices might increase by 50%.</p>
<p>Increase price of pig food is because of because failed crops in China, Russia and US. It is not overpriced, it is supply and demand that do its work.[/quote]</p>
<p>more so with beef, the general price for animal produce can still depend on droughts etc that happen 2-3 years prior, it’s a cycle that with a drought you have to kill livestock early resulting in less produce, less herd for next years breeding etc</p>

All the price is in the case/design.<br>
Open up some apple shit and there’s just the same hardware in it as others.<br>
Buying apple products is just retarded their a hige ripoff</p>

              <p>That’s the same reason a lot of these things are overpriced, someone spent time developing them and now wants to make money on them. The reason apple makes a lot of money is not because the products are amazing (because they really arent much better than counterparts), but it’s because they’ve become a popular brand that people ‘want to have’ to fit in. They know they can milk people for a ton of money, so hell, why not? They’re a company after all.</p>

<p>That is a terrible measure of value. In order to really get a value of something, we need to consider how much money we can get out of it.</p>
<p>Let say I sell you a barrel of oil for $150, you agree with my trade. Does your barrel of oil have a value of $150? No, the value of your barrel is still $110.</p>
