    <title>A simple command to display the last &#39;Tick&#39; time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-simple-command-to-display-the-last-tick-time/350042</link>
    <description>This tutorial will show you how to add a simple command that will send your character a message, to inform you of the latency of the last server &#39;tick&#39;. This can be put to good use - it can tell you whether the server tick is under a lot of &quot;stress&quot; (a longer delay) because of more players online etc (This could be used to tell you what amount of players is suitable for your computer specs by checking if the latency of the &#39;tick&#39; is average or over/under what it should be).

A server tick is what all the server &quot;processing&quot; is run on. Every tick, the player, npc and other processing are called [i][u][b]once[/b][/u][/i]. Most servers run on a tick of around 600ms (0.6 seconds).
For more information on what a &#39;Tick&#39; is, in RuneScape, look [url=http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Tick]here[/url].

The latency is how much more of a delay that the tick is taking to complete. This command that you will be creating in this tutorial will tell you how long each &#39;tick&#39; is taking to complete.

Firstly, we need to declare the variable that we will be using to find out the tick time. This will need to be delcared in the class that processing takes place in (Server.java, or whatever your server equivalent is e.g. Engine.java).
[code]public long tickTime;[/code]

Next, we need to make this equal to the current time. Usually System.currentTimeMillis() would be used, however we want a more accurate measure of how long the server tick takes to complete, so therefore we will be using System.nanoTime() - This gets a more accurate measure of the current time that System.currentTimeMillis().
In your Server class or whatever class contains the server&#39;s &quot;processing&quot;, you will see something similar to:
[code]                        playerHandler.process();
                        npcHandler.process();
                        itemHandler.process();
                        shopHandler.process();[/code]

It may or may not contain more processed methods. [u][b]Before[/b][/u] the first processed method call, you will need to add:
[code]long currentTime = System.nanoTime() / 1000000;[/code]

This will get the current time that the program (server) has been running for, in milliseconds. It has to be divided by 1000000 because a nanosecond is a billionth of a second and, in order to get the latency in milliseconds, we divide it by 1 million.

Next, we need to place this [b][u]after[/u][/b] the processed methods are called:
[code]tickTime = (System.nanoTime() / 1000000) - currentTime;[/code]

The current time is subtracted by the &#39;currentTime&#39; variable. This gets our delay in milliseconds, e.g. 200ms (0.2 seconds).


Finally, we need to create our command that will tell us the latency of the server last server tick.
[code]if (command.equals(&quot;ticktime&quot;)) {
	sendMessage(&quot;Time taken for last tick: &quot;+ Server.tickTime +&quot;ms.&quot;);
}[/code]

This command will send your character a message in the chatbox of how long the last &#39;tick&#39; took to complete, in milliseconds.

If you have any problems, don&#39;t hesitate to post them here or PM me them ;).</description>
