    <title>Something is up with my yell command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/something-is-up-with-my-yell-command/250261</link>
    <description>I am a noob and i know that. I am not, I repeat, NOT A LEECHER. I just cant figure out whats up with this code.
[code]            if (command.startsWith(&quot;yell&quot;) &amp;&amp; command.length() &gt; 5) {
                String text = command.substring(5);
                PlayerHandler.messageToAll = playerName + &quot;: &quot;
                        + Character.toUpperCase(text.charAt(0))
                        + text.substring(1) + &quot;&quot;;
     
    }[/code]
No errors when i compile but it, but it will not yell over the server. I dont want to be spoon fed, but i just started and need some help on what to do. Also if anyone has any code or tut on blocking muted yells that would be appreciated. Source is delta if you need to know. All the codes i do work on other servers but will not work with delta for some odd reason =/.</description>

              <p>Well that’s odd. I compiled after closing my client.java this time and it all popped up. That answers my second question. Thanks to everyone who helped. I would rep you but i have no clue how.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 13, 2008, 12:04:39 am[/size][hr]Ok now i seem to have a problem with the starters and the starting spot. I found the starter and changed it to what i wanted on client.java, but still the same starter as it was before. And the starting spot confuses me. It has same x y coords of all the other locations but above it is something with limits to the coords. If anyone has any idea how to help i would appreciate it. If you dont understand i can post more info just when i get some time.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 13, 2008, 12:06:31 am[/size][hr]bump plz</p>

Once again i am a noob and want to get my server edited before i start it up. Also for some reason when i edit starters and add objects the effects show up in the client.java but on the actual game nothing changes. I cannot makeGlobalobject, but i can deletethatobject. Any help on that one would be greatly appreciated too.</p>
