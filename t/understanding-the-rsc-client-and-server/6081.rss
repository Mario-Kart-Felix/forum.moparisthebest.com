    <title>Understanding the RSC Client and Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/understanding-the-rsc-client-and-server/6081</link>
    <description>In this &quot;series&quot; of tutorials I hope to help you understand how the RSC client works and provide you with the tools you need to start developing your own server.
These tutorials will not be &#39;noob friendly&#39; this meaning that you [b]must[/b] have some knowledge of Java and there will be no copy&amp;pasting.

I will be using Mudclient 203.
Netbeans would be a great help because of the built-in refactoring functions.



[b][size=20pt]Refactoring[/size][/b]

Refactoring the RSC client is almost essential to the development of you&#39;re own server. It will give you and understanding of how the entire client works together.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior. Its heart is a series of small behavior preserving transformations. Each transformation (called a &#39;refactoring&#39;) does little, but a sequence of transformations can produce a significant restructuring. Since each refactoring is small, it&#39;s less likely to go wrong. The system is also kept fully working after each small refactoring, reducing the chances that a system can get seriously broken during the restructuring.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We will not be as much &quot;refactoring&quot; the code as simply renaming fields and method thus making the overall client much easier to read and understand. 
If you would like to know all about refactoring then check out www.refactoring.com

The most simple way to start is to look at the strings in the mudclient.
You should find something like this very quickly:
[code]egc.cdn(&quot;Quest Points:@yel@&quot; + egm, (l + c1 / 2) - 5, l1 - 13, 1, 0xffffff);[/code]

Looks kind of confusing at first huh?
But if you have any Java knowledge at all you should quickly notice that &#39;egm&#39; is the amount of quest points this character has.
So you can now rename &#39;egm&#39; to something like &quot;questPts&quot;.

It seems that &#39;cdn&#39; is the method drawing this text on the screen.
Maybe we should look around for more uses of &#39;egm&#39;.

After a little bit of searching you&#39;ll find that &#39;cdn&#39; is used to draw text on: trade windows, bank windows, stat menus, etc.
What do all these have in common you ask?

They are all semi-transparent surfaces.
Now that we are fairly sure that &#39;cdn&#39; draws text on semi-transparent surfaces we could rename it to &quot;drawTextOnTransparency&quot; or of the like.

Maybe we should have a look at &#39;egc&#39; since &quot;drawTextOnTransparency&quot; was a member of it.

Search a bit for &#39;egc&#39; and you will find more drawing of strings and even some unknown things like:
[code]egc.cbc(byte0 + 5, byte1 + 222, 398, 0);[/code]

Eventually you will find the declaration of &#39;egc&#39;:
[code]private k egc;[/code]
This should immeadiatly tell you that egc is just an instance of class &#39;k&#39;.

Maybe we should look into class &#39;k&#39; to find out what it does.

Open class &#39;k&#39; and look for the recently renamed &quot;drawTextOnTransparency&quot;.
What? It wasn&#39;t in there?

Oh wait, look, class &#39;k&#39; is just and extension of class &#39;j&#39;.
Open up class &#39;j&#39; now and we&#39;ll have a look at it.

Immediately notice that class &#39;j&#39; has something to do with the game image from this code:
[code]public class j
    implements ImageProducer, ImageObserver[/code]

Look around a bit more and find that maybe &#39;j&#39; doesn&#39;t just have a little something to do with the game image. 
That it practically has everything to do with the game image.
If you&#39;re wondering how I came to that conclusion search around more until you notice that class &#39;j&#39; clips and plots sprites and many other things.

Now we are sure that &#39;j&#39; does the game image so we could rename it to something like: &quot;gameGraphicsFactory&quot;

Well, wait, what does &#39;k&#39; do then?
Head back to &#39;k&#39; and you&#39;ll see that, meh, it&#39;s just a tiny bit of code. What can it do?

Look around and you will see that a tiny bit of code goes a long ways in this case.

Here is the only function in class &#39;k&#39;:
[code]
    public final void cdc(int arg0, int arg1, int arg2, int arg3, int arg4, int arg5, int arg6)
    {
        if(arg4 &gt;= 50000)
        {
            dai.fck(arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4 - 50000, arg5, arg6);
            return;
        }
        if(arg4 &gt;= 40000)
        {
            dai.fed(arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4 - 40000, arg5, arg6);
            return;
        }
        if(arg4 &gt;= 20000)
        {
            dai.fdd(arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4 - 20000, arg5, arg6);
            return;
        }
        if(arg4 &gt;= 5000)
        {
            dai.fbn(arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4 - 5000, arg5, arg6);
            return;
        } else
        {
            super.ccc(arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4);
            return;
        }
    }

    public mudclient dai;[/code]
Hmm it seems to be calling a lot of methods from &#39;dai&#39;(which is just an instance of the mc)
Maybe we should check out these methods. 

Back to the mc and search for &#39;fck&#39; because it&#39;s one of the methods being called from class &#39;k&#39;.

You should find this code eventually:
[code]    final void fck(int arg0, int arg1, int arg2, int arg3, int arg4, int arg5, int arg6)
    {
        int l = eeh[arg4];
        int i1 = dim[arg4];
        if(l == 0)
        {
            int j1 = 255 + i1 * 5 * 256;
            egc.cal(arg0 + arg2 / 2, arg1 + arg3 / 2, 20 + i1 * 2, j1, 255 - i1 * 5);
        }
        if(l == 1)
        {
            int k1 = 0xff0000 + i1 * 5 * 256;
            egc.cal(arg0 + arg2 / 2, arg1 + arg3 / 2, 10 + i1, k1, 255 - i1 * 5);
        }
    }[/code]
Hmm it seems to just call some more methods from class &quot;gameGraphicsFactory&quot;.
You might be thinking &quot;wtf is he talking about? I don&#39;t see class &quot;gameGraphicsFactory&quot; anywhere.&quot;
If so you might want to brush up on your Java skills. :)

&#39;egc&#39; is an instance of class &#39;k&#39; which extends what is now &quot;gameGraphicsFactory&quot;.
Since &#39;cal&#39; is not a method of class &#39;k&#39; we can assume it is a method of &quot;gameGraphicsFactory&quot;.

So what class &#39;k&#39; is really doing is just calling the methods that were declared in &quot;gameGraphicsFactory&quot;.
Class &#39;k&#39; does a lot of the drawing with just this tiny bit of code.

We can safely assume that &#39;k&#39; and now be renamed to something along the lines of &quot;gameGraphics&quot;.
We&#39;ll call it that since &quot;gameGraphicsFactory&quot; does all the work but &quot;gameGraphics&quot; is almost like that boss. Telling &quot;gameGraphicsFactory&quot; (the workers) what to do.

Back to the code that you&#39;ve most likely forgotten about. :)
[code]egc.cdn(&quot;Quest Points:@yel@&quot; + egm, (l + c1 / 2) - 5, l1 - 13, 1, 0xffffff);[/code]

We know now that egc is really an instance of &quot;gameGraphics&quot; so we can probably rename it to something such as &quot;gameImage&quot;.

Whew!! All that work. Now Let&#39;s see what we ended up with.
[code]gameImage.drawTextOnTransparency(&quot;Quest Points:@yel@&quot; + questPts, (l + c1 / 2) - 5, l1 - 13, 1, 0xffffff);[/code]
*cricket chirps* :P
All that work for this measly line!

Oh wait, you will realize that, scrolling through the mc, this little renaming of 2 classes, 1 instance of a class, 1 method, and 1 field has actually turned some of the mudclient into much more readable code.
Little bits of renaming can go a very long way.


Keep on renaming using the methods that I&#39;ve shown you:

[ul][li]Analyze the Code Around What You are Trying to Rename[/li]
[li]Find Other Uses of the Code and Find the Similarity[/li]
[li]Trace it too the root and study what makes it tick[/li][/ul]

You should quickly develop you&#39;re own style of renaming the code 
Soon enough you should have a very readable mudclient and can move on to harder things.

Hint: If you are not sure of what you think a peice of code is then maybe put a &#39;p&#39; in front of it. ie. pNpcHp
P meaning possibility so that you don&#39;t accidently rename something wrong and screw up all you&#39;re work.



[b][size=20pt]Client Server Communication and Data Management[/size][/b]

Before we delve into how the client and server communicate with each other you should have a basic understanding of how input/output streams and sockets work. And because I do not wish to reinvent the wheel I will simply link you to a tutorial that I feel explains it well enough. Link: http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-1996/jw-12-sockets-p2.html
RS works on a TCP/IP connection in case you were wondering. 

[b]Client Side Data Management[/b]

Now from the tutorial you should of learned that input and output streams deal only in bytes. 
Everything has to be converted to a byte before it is sent.

Quick vocabulary lesson:
Word - 16 bit integer
DWord - Normal 32 bit integer
QWord - 64 bit long

RS save a little bit of bandwidth by using 16 bit integers instead of the normal 32 bit when the number never reaches above 32,000.

Now onto how the client manages all these bytes that it recieves from the server.
Maybe by now you&#39;ve noticed that in t.java there are some shifty operations going on. 
Haha, get it? Shifty operations...

Yah well since that really isn&#39;t funny I guess we will move on.
You&#39;ll probably be wondering what all bit shifting is doing.
You should have a good understanding of how shifting and bitwise operators work.
So Google it until you have a firm grasp on it.

Well let&#39;s take a look at one of the methods.
[code]    public static int fmi(byte arg0[], int arg1)
    {
        return ((arg0[arg1] &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 8) + (arg0[arg1 + 1] &amp; 0xff);
    }[/code]
Hmm this method seems shift an entire byte out of the arrray then combine it with the next byte, thus forming the 2 byte Word that is returned.
If you studied your bitwise operators well enough you should of immediately known that this returns a Word read from 2 bytes out of the supplied array of bytes.
2 Bytes = 16 Bits = Word

Keep looking throughout class &#39;t&#39; and rename all the methods that you see fit.
If you didn&#39;t catch it yet in t.java before each character&#39;s name is sent to the server or client it is compressed/converted into a QWord.

This is a very important part as when you write functions for your server you need to know what type of data to send to the client.
If you send the wrong type then it will obviously not work.
Later on we will analyze how to know what kind of data to send when writing the server-side functions.

On to how the client and server communicate.

[b]Client to Server Communication[/b]

The client and server communicate to each other using Frames. 
Each Frame has it&#39;s own unique ID that identifies what kind of function it is calling.
Most Frames have a payload of information that will be acted upon when the server or client recieves it.

Frame Types - http://rscd.eggsampler.com/wiki/?title=Packet_Format
That explains it much better than I could probably do so read it a few times.
If you&#39;re wondering why does it send the last data byte or parts of the data.
I personally assume that the client/server does a check to make sure that it recieved all the data. I may be wrong though so please someone correct me if I am.

With the frames the only part we will usually be dealing with is the command and data. The length part is handled by the client or server but you may have to deal with in some of the more complex packets.

Hopefully you&#39;ve noticed by now a lot of super.aag.* in the mudclient.
If you think they all seem to be related to actions than you are absolutely right.

If you haven&#39;t figured this out yet then I suggest you go study the mudclient because it would be best if you learn it on you&#39;re own. It will give you a much better understanding then if I just tell you.

You should of also noticed that whenever super.aag methods are called that it seems to fit to the packet structure that we discussed earlier.

How the super.aag methods work:
First the ID is sent.
Then if there is data that needs to be sent it is also.
The packet is constructed and send off.

This is relatively what you will see everytime except for a few special cases.

Each ID tells the server to execute a certain action.
If data is sent then usually the server will use that data in the action.

Let&#39;s take a look at how the MC decides what packet to send and where it gets it&#39;s data from.
When you click something like attack or trade first the client sets an action ID then later it sends off the packets that
the action ID said to send.

You should have probably noticed a lot of code like this by now:
[code]                       efd[efm] = &quot;Duel with&quot;;
                                egn[efm] = &quot;@whi@&quot; + dfm[i3].gme + s1;
                                eig[efm] = dfm[i3].gmh;
                                eih[efm] = dfm[i3].gmi;
                                dnm[efm] = 2806;
                                ege[efm] = dfm[i3].gmf;
                                efm++;[/code]
Obviously it&#39;s part the menu the client draws when you right click something.

In this case &#39;2806&#39; would be the action ID.
We should probably search a bit for 2806 in the client and see what else we can find.

Hmm the only other occurence of &#39;2806&#39; in the client is this:
[code]        if(i2 == 2806)
        {
            super.aag.hdn(103);
            super.aag.hcn(j1);
            super.aag.hdf();
        }[/code]
Well we talked about what the aag methods do so you should know that this is the code that is sent to the server when you try to duel with someone.
Obviously 103 is the Duel packet&#39;s ID.
You can make an accurate guess that j1 must the other player&#39;s ID or name.
If you&#39;ve refactored enough you won&#39;t have to guess and will know that it is in fact the player&#39;s serverside index.

You can keep doing this and quickly figure out what a lot of the packets functions are.

[b]Recieving Data[/b]
This is a bit of a shorter one so if you need more explanation simply tell me &quot;Hey I didn&#39;t really get how (x) works can you explain it a little bit more&quot; and hopefully I&#39;ll be in a good mood and try to help out a bit.  :P

Because Server -&gt; Client communication works on the exact same concept as Client -&gt; Server I&#39;m not really going to do a tutorial on it. 
You should be able to open up client.java and study it a bit and get as good as an understanding as at tutorial would give you.

Instead we&#39;ll look at how the Client and the Server recieve their data and act on it.

Hopefully you&#39;ve renamed most of t.java as it will be a big help in this part of the tutorial.

Open up the mudclient and search for the &#39;adf&#39; method.
This is where the client recieves and acts on all the information it gets from the server.

I&#39;ll start you out by letting you know that arg1 is the packet length and arg2 is the data.
If you can&#39;t figure out what arg0 is then you probably should go back and reread the entire thing. :)

You should be looking at some well-renamed code by now and that will make it a lot easier to figure things out.
Otherwise there is a very small chance that you will get anything out of this part of the tut.

There is a lot of action on the data isn&#39;t there?
Mostly from class &#39;t&#39; this is because, as I said before, t.java is used to extract ints, longs, strings and what not out of byte arrays. This will be a big help here.

This is how you can figure out what kind of data to send along with you&#39;re packet.

We&#39;ll take a look at packetID 204.
This is probably one of the easiest packets.
Here&#39;s the code:
[code]
            if(arg0 == 240)
            {
                ecm = t.fmh(arg2[1]) == 1;
                ede = t.fmh(arg2[2]) == 1;
                elc = t.fmh(arg2[3]) == 1;
                return;
            }[/code]
Not very obvious huh? 
Well hopefully you were smart enough to go about renaming it all and the function of it becomes very obvious.
I guess I&#39;ll give this one away as it&#39;s not very important so you can&#39;t go toting &quot;i g0t teh rsc server!&quot; if you try to C&amp;P.

Here&#39;s what it should look like renamed:
 [code]          if (command == 152) {
                autoCameraAngle = dataConversion.getUnsignedByte(data[1]) == 1;
                mouseButtons = dataConversion.getUnsignedByte(data[2]) == 1;
                soundEffects = dataConversion.getUnsignedByte(data[3]) == 1;
                return;
            }[/code]
Now it should be extremely obvious how this works. 
But I guess I will go ahead and give an explanation anyways. :)

autoCameraAngle, mouseButtons, and soundEffects are all booleans.
What this code does is check to see if the specified byte (data[1], [2], or [3]) is set to 1. 
If it is then it will set the specified boolean to true otherwise it will be false.

The use of this code would be upon a player&#39;s login it would retrieve their settings from a database and then send it to the client so that the player does not have to redo his settings everytime he enters RS.

Other packets are more complex but if you renamed like I told you to you should have no trouble quickly finding out how to spawn item, fill shop windows, turn prayers on and off, etc.

On to how the server recieves data:
We&#39;ll be using frank_&#39;s server source here. And although it&#39;s not the best (no offense frank_ :P) it&#39;s currently what&#39;s publicly available.

Open up client.java once again and take a look at the parseIncomingPackets method.
This is fully renamed so you shouldn&#39;t have a problem understanding it.

We&#39;ll take a look at how to create a simple dropping method. And yes you can copy and paste it but if you don&#39;t have an itemSpawn() and removeItem() method already it will be of no use to you. 

By using the methods we mentioned earlier find the id of the dropping command.
Or look at winterlove&#39;s tables and quickly find that it is 246. :)

So we need to add a case to handle the packet:
[code]case 146:
         slot = inStream.readUnsignedByte;
         removeItem(slot);
         spawnItem(inventory[slot], currentX, currentY);
         break;
[/code]
Obviously this will not work for you unless you have the right methods and arrays and variable and what not.

That was just an example showing how you could easily make a function to recieve and act on the packets you get from the client.
Very simple, if you&#39;ve done RS2 server I think it acts in almost the same way so you should be relatively familiar with it.

Now as I said before frank_&#39;s source isn&#39;t the best. (frank_: &lt;3 anyways :P)
In an ideal server you would most likely have an object that would handle all events from the clent.
But we deal with what we have.

Comments/Suggestions/Corrections all welcome.
If you want to correct me, do it civily, not something like &quot;fgt! wtf n00b you sp33led mudclient wr0ng!&quot;

I would very much like to know what kind of tutorials people would like.
But please remember they will be in the same fashion this one was; rather than improving your copy and paste skills it should hopefully improve understanding of the client and/or server.
