              <p>When your source cannot be defined as someone else’s source. Basically, changing quite a few things, a certain percentage. However, that percentage that you must change before it becomes yours, varies greatly. As someone stated before, you’re usually going to get called a leecher if you just take someones source, and change every instance of the server name to your new server name, same for old owners name, to your name. If you change the shops a bit, move some npcs, change the home area, and maybe even fix a few bugs to make it noticeably different, you shouldn’t have problems.</p>
