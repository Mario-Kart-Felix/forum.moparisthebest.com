    <title>Where did you guys learn programming?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-did-you-guys-learn-programming/404915</link>
    <description>I want to get into programming, especially for Android.
Whenever I go on these forums, I always see people programming their own stuff, whether it be a private server, website etc.
And from what I&#39;ve seen, the age range of users on here is like 14-20 right?
To me, its impressive that a 15 year old kid is coding his own software.
So I want advice from you guys.

When you guys had absolutely no information about programming, where did you start? Did you take classes, or teach yourself?
What language did you start with? I read somewhere and it said it&#39;d be easiest to start off with html, xhtml, css, javascript, and then work into BASIC and c#
Would you guys recommend that?
Is there any other advice you can give me?</description>

              <p>My best tip for learning a programming language is to not do it out of a ‘want’ to learn, but out of a ‘need’ to learn. If you’re trying to learn something just to say you know it, you’re not going to get far. When you’re learning something to build with, you hit all the speed bumps in the road, you have to troubleshoot, you learn the better and more efficient ways of doing something.</p>

Also got my hands on various books, such as Effective Java.</p>
<p>As for C, which I only really got into this year, I did my best to immerse myself in what I believe to be ‘good’ code. So I spent time reading through bits and pieces of the FreeBSD and OpenBSD source trees, the Atheme IRC services source tree, and Freenode’s new IRCD, etc.</p>

<p>Yay, Adobe FUD![/quote]<br>
Has IE 6-9 finally kept up with the rest of the browsers?<br>
In Europe and US/CA 99.5% uses Flash player 10. How many uses a HTML5 compatible browser?<br>
If it is a high amount, I admit I was wrong.</p>
<p>And I would never say you should use Flash over HTML5 when it comes to websites (Because flash-sites are shit)</p>
<p>Hopefully HTML5 will make Flash better, and Flash will make HTML5 better through competition. (And I wouldn’t be too surprised if Adobe Flash CS6 could output HTML5 and javascript.</p>

<p>but most important is determination (That I sadly lack).</p>
<p>Personally I started with Flash/AS 3.0. Not great but it is easy and have some great uses, everyone sees the content as you intended (As opposed to HTML5) and is multi platform (Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, <span class="bbcode-b">Android</span>…). But avoid making web-sites with it, but rather web-apps. If you want to make real computer software, stay away.</p>
<p>And don’t waste your time with (X)HTML, CSS and JavaScript if you aren’t going to use them.</p>

              <p>I want to get into programming, especially for Android.<br>
Whenever I go on these forums, I always see people programming their own stuff, whether it be a private server, website etc.<br>
And from what I’ve seen, the age range of users on here is like 14-20 right?<br>
To me, its impressive that a 15 year old kid is coding his own software.<br>
So I want advice from you guys.</p>
<p>When you guys had absolutely no information about programming, where did you start? Did you take classes, or teach yourself?<br>
What language did you start with? I read somewhere and it said it’d be easiest to start off with html, xhtml, css, javascript, and then work into BASIC and c#<br>
Would you guys recommend that?<br>
Is there any other advice you can give me?</p>
