Sometimes i do it daily but then i dont smoke a whole joint, just a lil bit so i guess thats not so bad</p>
<p>Last time i smoked i started seeing weird things like people were making weird faces and the noises were different but i’ve read somewhere that smoking cannabis doesnt make you hallucinate , so can anyone explain?</p>

<p>Now, I assume you smoked tobacco, when I smoke tobacco, I cough, I choke, after 10 mins I feel dizzy, I sweat and I’ve fainted 2 times. Cannabis smoking, however is different. Everything just seems slowed down, more colourful and such. This is different for different people but tobacco and cannabis smoking are COMPLETELY different.</p>

I was thinking it was the opposite because company cigarettes have filters on them and the hand rolled cigarettes do not.<br>
When i smoke tobacco i feel relaxed and nothing else.</p>
<p>I do agree that smoking cannabis and tobacco are completely different and im sure everyone who has smoked both would think the same.</p>

No, cannabis, marijuana, pot or whatever you want to call it is NOT harmful at all. It causes NO shortterm damage, nor longterm. Smoking it, of course will do some damage but then any kind of smoking will fuck you up. It is illegal because the fuck-tard scientists in the 60’s found out, smoking is <span class="bbcode-b">harmful</span>! No shit!</p>
<p>On a side note, the average PURE cannabis joint is roughly 10-20 machine-rolled cigarettes, or 5-10 hand rolled ones. The big companies put chemicals in their cigarettes.<br>

I’m not so sure about the shortterm damage.Last time i smoked was in school and it took me 5 fucking minutes to learn the translation of 1 word in french.(No ,this doesn’t happen when i don’t smoke)</p>

<p>What do you think?<br>
Should it be legal or remain illegal?</p>
