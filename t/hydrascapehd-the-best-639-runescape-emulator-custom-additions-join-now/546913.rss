[SIZE=&quot;4&quot;][SIZE=&quot;3&quot;]HydraScapeHD is a brand new 639 RuneScape Emulator that is soon to be a leading server in the RSPS&#39; scene, the server is owned by a group of highly professional developers that have over 15 years of experience between them, the features they add are 100% unique and this is what makes the server different from every other RSPS that is just a leech.[/SIZE][/SIZE]

[SIZE=&quot;4&quot;][CENTER]We have a very dedicated team of developers and managers who strive to produce the best experience for the players, they spend countless hours perfecting everything from quests to combat, from skills to bosses and nothing is ever unfinished.

Unlike most servers, the HydraScapeHD developers and managers listen to their players, if someone has an idea and they post it, it will definitely be looked over by the team and they will contemplate whether it should be added or not, every single person who is part of the community has a voice and no one goes without, we look after our players and this is the reason we have so many loyal veterans who have returned.[/CENTER][/SIZE]
