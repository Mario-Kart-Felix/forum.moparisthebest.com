    <description>[center][b]Hello, i figured i would make this cause i can&#39;t find a tutorial of it anywhere.[/b]
[/center]

[b][u]DO NOT POST THIS ANYWHERE! ONLY I CAN DO THAT. YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION[/u][/b]


Description

[ul][li]Length: about 5 minutes depending on how long you will be talking to the npc for[/li]
[li]Difficulty: about 2/10 if you know how to copy and paste[/li][/ul]


(everything is done in client.java, notes on bottom might fix a problem you might be getting)
[b]Step 1:[/b]
Open client.java in source
search for
[code]case 40:[/code]
this ill explain later, but you should see something like this
[code]			case 40:
				if (NpcDialogue == 1 || NpcDialogue == 3 || NpcDialogue == 5  || NpcDialogue == 40 || NpcDialogue == 42 || NpcDialogue == 

1001 || NpcDialogue == 1002 || NpcDialogue == 2259 || NpcDialogue == 2260 || NpcDialogue == 301 || NpcDialogue == 305 || NpcDialogue == 308 || NpcDialogue == 

309 || NpcDialogue == 313 || NpcDialogue == 314 || NpcDialogue == 317 || NpcDialogue == 318 || NpcDialogue == 319 || NpcDialogue == 322 || NpcDialogue == 323 

|| NpcDialogue == 14600 || NpcDialogue == 14602 || NpcDialogue == 550 || NpcDialogue == 1694 || NpcDialogue == 1339 || NpcDialogue == 800 || NpcDialogue == 

801 || NpcDialogue == 802 || NpcDialogue == 803 || NpcDialogue == 804 || NpcDialogue == 805 || NpcDialogue == 806 || NpcDialogue == 807)
//need for npc talking not shouting[/code]
all you need to do here is note a free #, try to make it end with two zeros. For example you see 800, then 801 then 802 and so on...  That is all one conversation. so find a free one for example in this code a free set of numbers would be 900. When you talk to an npc you have to click continue, every box with dialog from the npc will have a id number, and will go up here.


[b]Step 2:[/b]
now pick an npc, for this tutorial i will use npc 599, aka the make-over mage
search for one of the numbers you saw in step one that ends with 00, for example i will search for 14600, it should be the very next one or something close to it. you should see something like this
[code]else if(NPCID == 599) { // Make over mage
skillX = server.npcHandler.npcs[NPCSlot].absX;
skillY = server.npcHandler.npcs[NPCSlot].absY;
NpcWanneTalk = 14600;
}[/code]
Where it says &quot;NPCID == 599&quot; in red, 599 is the npc id i want to be able to talk to. &quot;NpcWanneTalk = 14600;&quot; is the dialog box they will be using. copy and paste this code under the last } of the one in your client, or you can just copy and paste the on in your client (might be a better idea). So replace 599 with the id of the npc u want to use, and 14600 with the dialog box you decided to use.

[b]Step 3:[/b]
Now here comes the really really fun part. Search for a preexisting npc dialog box. I will search for &quot;14600&quot; (only because i already have it). You should see something like this
[code]         case 14600: // Make over mage chat
            sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4903);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Yo you want a make over?&quot;, 4904);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4905);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4906);
            sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4901);
            sendFrame164(4900);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;[/code]
or
[code]         case 14601: // Make over mage chat option - choose make over y/n
            sendFrame171(1, 2465);
            sendFrame171(0, 2468);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Select an Option&quot;, 2460);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Sure&quot;, 2461);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Nope&quot;, 2462);
            sendFrame164(2459);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;[/code]
or close to that. Right above that case copy and paste this
[code]         case 14600: // Make over mage chat
            sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4903);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Yo you want a make over?&quot;, 4904);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4905);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4906);
            sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4901);
            sendFrame164(4900);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;[/code]
ok quick lets break this code down. (make sure when u paste it, you leave a couple of paragraph breaks on top and bottom so you can tell it apart of the others, it can get quite confusing). 
case 14600 is the npc&#39;s dialog box id. so paste the new one there. The &quot;// Make over mage chat&quot; is just notes. &quot;sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);&quot; says that the npc will be talking and not you, it is kinda useless (but you need it!) because of the step one case 40 thing. when ever you are the one talking and not the npc, you dont put that dialog box id in case 40!!!!! Anyway... lets go on,
[code]            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4903);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Yo you want a make over?&quot;, 4904);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4905);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4906);[/code]
everything in the &quot; &quot; is what the npc says. try to use 4904 - 4906 only, 4903 makes that nice space on top from the npc&#39;s name and what he says. if u add a 4907 it can change the &quot;continue&quot; to what ever you put in the quotes, it will stay like that even if you remove it! The only way to get rid of that is to add a 4907 on the first dialog box for that npc and put continue there in the quotes.
[code]            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;[/code]
this says show what the npc is saying then end this box.
so copy and paste the code in, or copy and re-paste your code in and edit it to your needs.



[b]Step 4:[/b]
every dialog box you add that the npc talk in, you add its dialog box id to the &quot;case 40:&quot; in step one, so lets say i make a dialog box with the id 14601 and the npc talks in that box, i would add
 [code] || NpcDialogue == 14601 [/code]
to case 40 (explained again and a little better later on)
Usually you keep the dialog box id&#39;s that are related, next to each other, so like all the 14600&#39;s are next to each other, all the 800&#39;s are next to each other and so on. Now lets say you want to add an option for you to talk, you would add this code
[code]         case 14601: // Make over mage chat option - choose make over y/n
            sendFrame171(1, 2465);
            sendFrame171(0, 2468);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Select an Option&quot;, 2460);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Sure&quot;, 2461);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Nope&quot;, 2462);
            sendFrame164(2459);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;[/code]
anything in line 2460 is normal text, anything in 2461 says continue with conversation. anything in line 2462 says end conversation. (note: that you need either more conversation next and you have to have an end script to make it so you can exit the conversation by hitting continue and not having to walk away, ill explain more later), so yea make sure u change this dialog box id to the next available one in that set, so if the npc spoke in 14600 and 14601, change this to 14602, but dont add it to the &quot;case 40&quot; in step 1. edit it to your needs and paste it in.



[b]Step 5:[/b]
note: that you can have as many as either dialog box that you want in any order, as long as the id&#39;s are in order and the code is correct.
ok so if you dont add an execution code after the very last dialog box code, (it looks like this)
[code]         case 808: // Make over mage chat accept coins
            if(playerHasItemAmount(995, 0)) {
            deleteItem(995, getItemSlot(995), 0);
            showInterface(10969);
            NpcDialogue = 0;
            break;
            }
            else {
            sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4903);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Thanks&quot;, 4904);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4905);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4906);
            sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4901);
            sendFrame164(4900);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;
            }[/code]
you can use that one, just change the id (so if the last dialog box id was 14602, make this one 14603)
if you dont have an execution code (because the purpose of talking to an npc is to have something completed) it will say &quot;please wait...&quot; for ever at the last dialog box after you hit continue, Unless you walk away. The execution codes do something, This one pretty much states, take 0 coins out of the guys inventory (so there is no effect and something happened). You can change it so that the guy is teleported somewhere (look below for some execution codes), given something, looses something. so yea copy this edit it to your needs and your done.
congrats.



[b]Execution codes:[/b]
given something
[code]         case 808: // Make over mage chat accept coins
            if(playerHasItemAmount(itemid, amount)) {
            addItem(995, getItemSlot(itemid), amount);
            showInterface(10969);
            NpcDialogue = 0;
            break;
            }
            else {
            sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4903);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Thanks&quot;, 4904);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4905);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4906);
            sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4901);
            sendFrame164(4900);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;
            }[/code]

loses something
[code]         case 808: // Make over mage chat accept coins
            if(playerHasItemAmount(itemid, amount)) {
            deleteItem(995, getItemSlot(itemid), amount);
            showInterface(10969);
            NpcDialogue = 0;
            break;
            }
            else {
            sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4903);
            sendFrame126(&quot;Thanks&quot;, 4904);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4905);
            sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4906);
            sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4901);
            sendFrame164(4900);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;
            }[/code]

teleported somewhere
search for &quot;case 9157:&quot;
find something that looks like this
[code]else if (NpcDialogue == 2260) { // Mage Of Zamorak
NpcDialogue = 0;
NpcDialogueSend = false;
                sendMessage(&quot;You teleport to the abyss.&quot;);
		teleportToX = 3040;
                teleportToY = 4842;
		}[/code]
(you might have to scroll down a little)
2260 is the dialog box id, the teleportToX and teleportToY are the coords, yo might have to replace that entire 2 lines with &quot;triggerTele(3213, 3467, 0);&quot;
3213 is the x coord, 3467 is the y coord, and 0 is the hight. if the first code works, and the npc is not on height level u want to teleport to, u should add &quot;heightLevel = 0;&quot; under the y coord line
then at the last dialog box of the conversation you were having, and end it like any other but without the execution code, you can even end it with you talking =p



[b]note: if you tried to make a fourth line and the continue button says something weird now, make a fourth line like you tried to make, but failed to, on the first dialog box of that npc. and put &quot;continue&quot; in the quotes[/b]

//need for npc talking not shouting[/code]<br>
all you need to do here is note a free #, try to make it end with two zeros. For example you see 800, then 801 then 802 and so on…  That is all one conversation. so find a free one for example in this code a free set of numbers would be 900. When you talk to an npc you have to click continue, every box with dialog from the npc will have a id number, and will go up here.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2:</span><br>
now pick an npc, for this tutorial i will use npc 599, aka the make-over mage<br>
search for one of the numbers you saw in step one that ends with 00, for example i will search for 14600, it should be the very next one or something close to it. you should see something like this</p>
<p><code>else if(NPCID == 599) { // Make over mage
skillX = server.npcHandler.npcs[NPCSlot].absX;
skillY = server.npcHandler.npcs[NPCSlot].absY;
NpcWanneTalk = 14600;
}</code><br>
Where it says “NPCID == 599” in red, 599 is the npc id i want to be able to talk to. “NpcWanneTalk = 14600;” is the dialog box they will be using. copy and paste this code under the last } of the one in your client, or you can just copy and paste the on in your client (might be a better idea). So replace 599 with the id of the npc u want to use, and 14600 with the dialog box you decided to use.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3:</span><br>
Now here comes the really really fun part. Search for a preexisting npc dialog box. I will search for “14600” (only because i already have it). You should see something like this</p>
<p><code>         case 14600: // Make over mage chat
            sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);
            sendFrame126("", 4903);
            sendFrame126("Yo you want a make over?", 4904);
            sendFrame126("", 4905);
            sendFrame126("", 4906);
            sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4901);
            sendFrame164(4900);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;</code><br>
or</p>
<p><code>         case 14601: // Make over mage chat option - choose make over y/n
            sendFrame171(1, 2465);
            sendFrame171(0, 2468);
            sendFrame126("Select an Option", 2460);
            sendFrame126("Sure", 2461);
            sendFrame126("Nope", 2462);
            sendFrame164(2459);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;</code><br>
or close to that. Right above that case copy and paste this</p>
<p><code>         case 14600: // Make over mage chat
            sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);
            sendFrame126("", 4903);
            sendFrame126("Yo you want a make over?", 4904);
            sendFrame126("", 4905);
            sendFrame126("", 4906);
            sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4901);
            sendFrame164(4900);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;</code><br>
ok quick lets break this code down. (make sure when u paste it, you leave a couple of paragraph breaks on top and bottom so you can tell it apart of the others, it can get quite confusing).<br>
case 14600 is the npc’s dialog box id. so paste the new one there. The “// Make over mage chat” is just notes. “sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);” says that the npc will be talking and not you, it is kinda useless (but you need it!) because of the step one case 40 thing. when ever you are the one talking and not the npc, you dont put that dialog box id in case 40!!! Anyway… lets go on,</p>
<p><code>            sendFrame126("", 4903);
            sendFrame126("Yo you want a make over?", 4904);
            sendFrame126("", 4905);
            sendFrame126("", 4906);</code><br>
everything in the " " is what the npc says. try to use 4904 - 4906 only, 4903 makes that nice space on top from the npc’s name and what he says. if u add a 4907 it can change the “continue” to what ever you put in the quotes, it will stay like that even if you remove it! The only way to get rid of that is to add a 4907 on the first dialog box for that npc and put continue there in the quotes.</p>
<p><code>            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;</code><br>
this says show what the npc is saying then end this box.<br>
so copy and paste the code in, or copy and re-paste your code in and edit it to your needs.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 4:</span><br>
every dialog box you add that the npc talk in, you add its dialog box id to the “case 40:” in step one, so lets say i make a dialog box with the id 14601 and the npc talks in that box, i would add</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>to case 40 (explained again and a little better later on)<br>
Usually you keep the dialog box id’s that are related, next to each other, so like all the 14600’s are next to each other, all the 800’s are next to each other and so on. Now lets say you want to add an option for you to talk, you would add this code</p>
<p><code>         case 14601: // Make over mage chat option - choose make over y/n
            sendFrame171(1, 2465);
            sendFrame171(0, 2468);
            sendFrame126("Select an Option", 2460);
            sendFrame126("Sure", 2461);
            sendFrame126("Nope", 2462);
            sendFrame164(2459);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;</code><br>
anything in line 2460 is normal text, anything in 2461 says continue with conversation. anything in line 2462 says end conversation. (note: that you need either more conversation next and you have to have an end script to make it so you can exit the conversation by hitting continue and not having to walk away, ill explain more later), so yea make sure u change this dialog box id to the next available one in that set, so if the npc spoke in 14600 and 14601, change this to 14602, but dont add it to the “case 40” in step 1. edit it to your needs and paste it in.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 5:</span><br>
note: that you can have as many as either dialog box that you want in any order, as long as the id’s are in order and the code is correct.<br>
ok so if you dont add an execution code after the very last dialog box code, (it looks like this)</p>
<p><code>         case 808: // Make over mage chat accept coins
            if(playerHasItemAmount(995, 0)) {
            deleteItem(995, getItemSlot(995), 0);
            showInterface(10969);
            NpcDialogue = 0;
            break;
            }
            else {
            sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);
            sendFrame126("", 4903);
            sendFrame126("Thanks", 4904);
            sendFrame126("", 4905);
            sendFrame126("", 4906);
            sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4901);
            sendFrame164(4900);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;
            }</code><br>
you can use that one, just change the id (so if the last dialog box id was 14602, make this one 14603)<br>
if you dont have an execution code (because the purpose of talking to an npc is to have something completed) it will say “please wait…” for ever at the last dialog box after you hit continue, Unless you walk away. The execution codes do something, This one pretty much states, take 0 coins out of the guys inventory (so there is no effect and something happened). You can change it so that the guy is teleported somewhere (look below for some execution codes), given something, looses something. so yea copy this edit it to your needs and your done.<br>
congrats.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Execution codes:</span><br>
given something</p>
<p><code>         case 808: // Make over mage chat accept coins
            if(playerHasItemAmount(itemid, amount)) {
            addItem(995, getItemSlot(itemid), amount);
            showInterface(10969);
            NpcDialogue = 0;
            break;
            }
            else {
            sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);
            sendFrame126("", 4903);
            sendFrame126("Thanks", 4904);
            sendFrame126("", 4905);
            sendFrame126("", 4906);
            sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4901);
            sendFrame164(4900);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;
            }</code></p>
<p>loses something</p>
<p><code>         case 808: // Make over mage chat accept coins
            if(playerHasItemAmount(itemid, amount)) {
            deleteItem(995, getItemSlot(itemid), amount);
            showInterface(10969);
            NpcDialogue = 0;
            break;
            }
            else {
            sendFrame126(GetNpcName(NpcTalkTo), 4902);
            sendFrame126("", 4903);
            sendFrame126("Thanks", 4904);
            sendFrame126("", 4905);
            sendFrame126("", 4906);
            sendFrame75(NpcTalkTo, 4901);
            sendFrame164(4900);
            NpcDialogueSend = true;
            break;
            }</code></p>
<p>teleported somewhere<br>
search for “case 9157:”<br>
find something that looks like this</p>
<p><code>else if (NpcDialogue == 2260) { // Mage Of Zamorak
NpcDialogue = 0;
NpcDialogueSend = false;
                sendMessage("You teleport to the abyss.");
		teleportToX = 3040;
                teleportToY = 4842;
		}</code><br>
(you might have to scroll down a little)<br>
2260 is the dialog box id, the teleportToX and teleportToY are the coords, yo might have to replace that entire 2 lines with “triggerTele(3213, 3467, 0);”<br>
3213 is the x coord, 3467 is the y coord, and 0 is the hight. if the first code works, and the npc is not on height level u want to teleport to, u should add “heightLevel = 0;” under the y coord line<br>
then at the last dialog box of the conversation you were having, and end it like any other but without the execution code, you can even end it with you talking =p</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">note: if you tried to make a fourth line and the continue button says something weird now, make a fourth line like you tried to make, but failed to, on the first dialog box of that npc. and put “continue” in the quotes</span></p>
