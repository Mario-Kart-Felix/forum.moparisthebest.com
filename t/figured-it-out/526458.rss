Flask is very, very flexible whereas Django isn’t as much. I mean, Django is good for fast development but if you have enough time you should definitely use Flask. You should also take a look at pyramid, another good python framework.[/quote]Alright, thanks! I’ll be sure to check them out. This could be some fun, other then the fact I’ll be ripping my hair out at times, yeah.</p>

<p>Writing them flat file is an incredibly slow and painful way of doing it, databases are much cleaner and more effective in this example. Be sure to use either mysqli or PDO since they support prepared statements and ultimately minimize exploits that can be made. PDO also completely excludes SQL injection as a form of hacking so you’re much better using that. If you need some examples, let me know and I’ll whip some up.<br>

+1, PDO is awesome. Never see anyone using it here :([/quote]<br>
Most people who bother to do website development here either use it or use a better language than php. Theres still a few stragglers using mysql_ functions but that’s soon beaten out of them with a shitty stick. The only reason I still use php is because I have done for the past 4/5 years and its just a habit to use it now. I highly recommend anyone who’s just getting into website development to use Sinatra, Express or something python based like Flask or Django.</p>
