              <p>Sockets are for TCP connections, if you want speed but no promises on delivery check out the UDP classes such as DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket.  If you want the delivery promise (meaning not lost packets), you’ll have to modify your UDP socket to check for Sequence numbers and package checksums (which you’d have to add manually)…it’s not too difficult, just a bit more coding <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>popcorn’s deobber is just a collection of programs to disassemble the latest RS client. The actually deobfuscator is the Zerix KlassMaster (ZKM) that is included.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@side</span> question:</p>
<p>Here is a simple way:</p>
<p>serverside:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(1025); //start a new server socket on port 1025
while (true) { //create infinite loop while the server socket is running
Socket sock = ss.accept(); //construct a new Socket to the connecting client
if (true) { //if there is a connection, continue
System.out.println("received connection from: " + sock.getIntetAddress().getHostName() + ":" + sock.getPort());
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(sock.getInputStream()); //start a new BufferedReader instance according to the InputStream of the socket
BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(sock.getOutputStream()); //start a new BufferedWriter instance according to the OuputStream of the socket
System.out.println("string from client: " + in.readLine()); //print out the the text the client sent into the command line
out.write("hai"); //write the client the String "hai"
}
}</code></pre>
<p>clientside:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Socket s = new Socket("127.0.0.1", 1025); //establish a socket connection to host "127.0.0.1" on port 1025
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(s.getInputStream()); //start a new BufferedReader instance according to the InputStream of the socket
BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(s.getOutputStream()); //start a new BufferedWriter instance according to the OuputStream of the socket
out.write("haider"); //write the server the String "haider"
System.out.println("Sent packet.\nResponse: " + in.readLine()); //print out the read string from the server into the command line</code></pre>
<p>I may be a little off because I just wrote this up, but I hope it helps you understand clientside-serverside connections better.</p>
