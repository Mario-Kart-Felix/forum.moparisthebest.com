    <description>Recently I&#39;ve been trying to add a full set of working monkey greegrees to my server in order to make a quest. I found a tutorial on how to get all the gorilla-shaped ones working, but I can&#39;t find the IDs for the weapon, run, walk, stand and block animations for each of them. I really only need a set of one more, as I just have to get the Karamanja, small &amp; medium ninja and zombie monkeys working. Can anyone help me?</description>
