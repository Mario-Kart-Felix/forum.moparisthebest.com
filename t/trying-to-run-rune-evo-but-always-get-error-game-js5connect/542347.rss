    <title>Trying to run Rune-Evo but always get error_game_js5connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trying-to-run-rune-evo-but-always-get-error-game-js5connect/542347</link>
    <description>If anyone knows the fix to this i would greatly appreciate it, its just rune-evo&#39;s source that i cant play on, matrix 718 works fine. Every client i have downloaded has the same error (error_game_js5connect) and all these clients run with matrix just fine. This is why i think its the source and not the client i could be wrong sorry if i post in the wrong section.

Thanks</description>
