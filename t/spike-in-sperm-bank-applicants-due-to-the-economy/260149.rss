    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;LOVELAND, Colo. — Applications from would-be donors at a Loveland sperm bank have spiked in recent months, jumping from about 150 applications in a year to 400 since September. Betsy Cairo of CryoGam Colorado told Denver station KMGH-TV that there have been 172 applicants in January alone. Cairo says it&#39;s the economy, adding that there aren&#39;t that many applications during good times.

Dr. Eric Surrey of Denver&#39;s Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine said he&#39;s noticed an increase in women volunteering to become egg donors, but not as much as the number at CryoGam.

Cairo would not say how much a sperm donor can earn but added it&#39;s not as easy as it sounds. Of the applications received since September, only four donors have been accepted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
