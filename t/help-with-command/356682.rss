    <title>Help with Command!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-command/356682</link>
    <description>Hello guys, this is a very easy fix, but I can&#39;t seem to remember how I could possibly work it out. So in other words...I&#39;m stumped.
Okay so what I&#39;m trying to do is make it so ONLY Donators and Staff positions can yell. It works  perfectly, the only problem is, when I am PlayerRights == 0 and I use a command, it will tell me what I made it say when a normal player tries to yell.
Here&#39;s the code:
[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;yell&quot;) &amp;&amp; command.length() &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1 || donator &gt;= 1) {
                String titles = &quot;&quot;;

                if (donator == 1) {
		    titles = &quot;@blu@[Premium Member] &quot;;
		}

 		if (playerRights == 1) {
                    titles = &quot;@blu@[Moderator] &quot;;
                }

                if (playerRights == 2) {
                    titles = &quot;@blu@[Administrator] &quot;;
                }


                if (playerRights == 3) {
                    titles = &quot;[Co-Owner] &quot;;
                }
		
		
		if (playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;####&quot;)) {
                    titles = &quot;@red@[OWNER] &quot;;
                }

	

//if (playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;####&quot;)) {
                    //titles = &quot;@red@[Owner]&quot;;
                //}

               yell(titles + &quot;&quot; + playerName + &quot;: &quot;
                        + command.substring(5));
		}else{
		if(playerRights == 0) {
		sM(&quot;You must be a Premium, Donator, or a staff member to yell!&quot;);
}
}
[/code]
