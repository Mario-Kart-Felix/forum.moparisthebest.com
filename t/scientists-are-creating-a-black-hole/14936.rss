    <title>Scientists are creating a Black Hole</title>

    <description>[url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=325&amp;objectid=10400645]http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=325&amp;objectid=10400645[/url]

&lt;blockquote&gt;* Scientists aim to reproduce miniature versions of the so-called Big Bang, which is thought to have started the universe.
 
* To do this they will smash protons together at huge speeds along a 27km tube known as a particle accelerator.
 
* They hope to create tiny black holes or find extra dimensions in the universe.
 
* They estimate the possibility of accidentally destroying the planet as extremely low.
 
* The risk is calculated at about 10 to the minus 40 - a 1 in 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 chance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the theories are correct, the machine will create tiny black holes that evaporate and possibly even find particles that offer evidence that the three dimensions known to mankind are just a fraction of those that exist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

I think the Big Bang goes through a repeating cycle. Right now,  it is contracticting, and will be back to its form before the big bang in about 20 billion years.<br>

</aside>
<p>Though the universe is finite, there is no edge.The universe curves inward, so if you hit the “Edge” what you’re really doing is moving so fast that time no longer is going on, eventually so fast that time is moving backward. So the universe stops receeding and starts contracting. Just make sure you time your slowdown and particle reallignment before you experience the reverse big bang and end up being nothingness.</p>

<p>At 99.99% of the speed of light your mass will rise to 70 times your stationary mass. It is impossible to get to 100% the speed of light, because at that point you would be infinitely heavy, and that is clearly not possible.</p>

If it was expanding fairly slowly, the force of gravity would cause it eventually to stop expanding and then to start contracting. However, if it was expanding at more than a certain critical rate, gravity would never be strong enough to stop it, and the universe would continue to expand forever. 
<p>A remarkable feature of the first kind of Friedmann model is that in it the universe is not infinite in space, but neither does space have any boundary. Gravity is so strong that space is bent round onto itself, making it rather like the surface of the earth. If one keeps traveling in a certain direction on the surface of the earth, one never comes up against an impassable barrier or falls over the edge, but eventually comes back to where one started. 47</p>

<p>If you went fast enough outward toward the “Edge” of the universe, you would end up back at the big bang. You would see all of time run in reverse, and the universe would <span class="bbcode-b">contract</span> back to where it was before it began <span class="bbcode-b">expanding</span>. Not like a crappy FPS game.</p>

<p>One guy said that it would be like time travel, and I said, well you could never get to that point.  You said yes, you could, if you were going at the speed of light.  I said, no, because the a point on the “edge” will recede faster than the speed of light.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s all so complicated. The depressing thing about black holes (apart from the color) is that anything that begins to be attracted to them or enters them (which is the same thing) will for all intesive purposes be destroyed. There must be another way of achieving light speed without the risk of passing through a singularity. A safe, pleasent, air conditioned way :P.</p>

<p>Though the universe is finite, there is no edge.The universe curves inward, so if you hit the “Edge” what you’re really doing is moving so fast that time no longer is going on, eventually so fast that time is moving backward. So the universe stops receeding and starts expanding. Just make sure you time your slowdown and particle reallignment before you experience the reverse big bang and end up being nothingness.</p>
