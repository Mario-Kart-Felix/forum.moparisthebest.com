    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-can-help-me-making-safe-zones/105937</link>
    <description>Title says it all...
I managed a few safe zones but most of the time I mess them up...
I really don&#39;t know why... If someone is good at making safe zones...
Can you help me plz?
Or if you can also get them out of your client this are the places that need to be safe zone:
Crandor island
and the basement of Legends Guild
You can also come on my server if usefull
Please PM me for details of server to come on it and make me codes for the safe zones

Thanks.</description>
