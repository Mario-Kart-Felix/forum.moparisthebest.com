To me, it doesn’t look good, it isn’t fun, and I can’t get into killing the enemies. I can’t get into it at all, not even multiplayer.<br>

<p>Plus quite a bit more for a whole year. I’ll take a “lesser” service and play intermittently over a few months rather than being dictated when to play if I don’t want to spend the $70 or so for a years subscription.</p>

<p>But yes, the Xbox does have superior online play.  Besides the fact there IS less Lag (although its still evident), the xbox also includes a mic in even their most basic console.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So Xbox online is better because there’s less lag, and because of what the console bundle offers.</p>
<p>The only lag issues I have on ps3 is with shitty games like COD where network issues are universal, 64 player resistance 2 games years after the launch np np no lag to speak of.</p>
<p>Also as STH mentions, any bluetooth or usb mics will work, and the official ps3 headset can be used as a general purpose bluetooth headset too.</p>

<p>Well, in the past I’ve always voted PS3 because of it’s superior hardware, superior longevity (doesn’t burn up in 2 months like the 360s), and, most importantly to me, it’s “open” nature, letting Linux run on it and such.  Then Sony updated it so Linux couldn’t access the graphics card, then Sony ‘patched’ it so that you can no longer run Linux on it, regardless of whether it’s already installed or not.  Fuckers.

<p>That’s probably true, I don’t play them much at all, I mainly use the PS3 for a blu-ray player and media player off my Linux server anyhow.</p>
<p>Another reason the PS3 is better than the Xbox is that you can play it online, unlimited, for free.  The Xbox you have to pay monthly to play it online, so it’s online play should be substantially better, and it isn’t.  (granted, I think I’ve played one off-road PS3 game online once)<br>
[/quote]The xbox online is substantially better…</p>
<p>You guys all buy into this stupid propaganda about consoles.  Media will always portray a competition and no out right winner because if they did there would be monopolization in the industry.  I choose to use an Xbox 360, because its what I enjoy and because I never bought into the whole PS3 having superior ANYTHING.  It doesn’t.  They’re practically carbon copies of each other except for the graphical engine itself that you write for in their respected DKs.  Hence, why soem games look better on XBox, and some better on PS3.</p>
<p>It all comes down to preference, and what your friends are playing.</p>
<p>But yes, the Xbox does have superior online play.  Besides the fact there IS less Lag (although its still evident), the xbox also includes a mic in even their most basic console.</p>

</aside>
<p>And the PS3 includes a 802.11N card in even their most basic console.  I’ll take that over a $5 Mic any day.  Lag would depend on your geographical location, ISP, and the geographical location of the server.  So what exactly makes Xbox online play worth so much more (what is it?  $15/month?) than PS3 online play?[/quote]1) The new xbox (repalcing all the old models) does as well.  And a 250GB HD.<br>
2) The mic is more than $5 and has lasted me since I purchased it.<br>
3) Its not like Xbox live is one centralized server…</p>

<p>Me and a co-worker have convinced most people at work to switch. You’re right, the only thing I wish is that more of the people I know had one.</p>
<p>It’s a trade-off though, cause my two best friends have PS3s and we play together often. However, I don’t like having a lot of friends on it because every time I get on people want to talk/play/etc and a lot of times I just want to play alone and relax. I almost never add people I don’t know as friends because of that.</p>
<p>One of the only games I like to play with friends though is Left For Dead 2, and I can just turn on the X360 or my computer to play with friends on that, so that’s good.</p>

<p>My bluetooth headset that was bought for something other than my PS3 works just fine on it. So will most bluetooth headsets and USB mics.</p>
<p>What is this propaganda you’re talking about? I have a better experience online with my PS3 than my X360, and I don’t have to pay extra for it. And it’s not like anyone sold me that or tried to feed that into my brain, that’s just how I feel about it.</p>
<p>Inside of the console they could be copies for all I care, I just know that I like the PS3 more. Wireless/Bluray on even the most basic PS3 is something the X360 can’t compete with. Also, the PS3 exclusive games are much more enjoyable to me and push the console to limits that few X360 games do.</p>

<p>Not at all. That is complete rubbish. The actual online play is exactly the same. In fact, you actually see Sony pushing their online play further than anything Microsoft have been willing to do, with stuff like MAG (256 Player Online), Resistance 2 (62 player online) etc.</p>
<p>What Xbox live is better at is stuff like cross-game chat, universal matchmaking, and other standard features that are implemented into the console and don’t rely on the developer to implement them. Actual online play is no different.The online service as a whole, including all the surrounding features is better, though, still not worth the money Microsoft charge.</p>

Hence, why soem games look better on XBox, and some better on PS3.</p>
<p>It all comes down to preference, and what your friends are playing.</p>
<p>But yes, the Xbox does have superior online play.  Besides the fact there IS less Lag (although its still evident), the xbox also includes a mic in even their most basic console.[/quote]</p>
<p>And the PS3 includes a 802.11N card in even their most basic console.  I’ll take that over a $5 Mic any day.  Lag would depend on your geographical location, ISP, and the geographical location of the server.  So what exactly makes Xbox online play worth so much more (what is it?  $15/month?) than PS3 online play?</p>
