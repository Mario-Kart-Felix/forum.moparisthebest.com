    <title>Help Deciphering this Data [Will Rep]</title>

    <description>If anyone knows...this maybe over some/most of you.

[code]
NpcDefinition:@147ee05
Walk:@15b9e68
Mask:@1fcf0ce
Definition:@1256ea2
[/code]

The only part really important to me is either the NpcDefinition or the Walk, I am trying to decipher this into a value for the emote of the npc. The npc is irrelevant, I have already tried taking out the later values such as @14705 = 14705. That does not seem to work. I&#39;m sure it must be a skip, although I am sorta of clueless on this.

This is the rest of the values dumped from the cache.

Not sure if this is against the rules, but rep if you help in any way.

If it helps anyone I&#39;m printing a hash which I know is a horrible thing, but I&#39;m trying to convert it into a string...</description>
