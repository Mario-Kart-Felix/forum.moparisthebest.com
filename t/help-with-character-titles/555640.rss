    <title>Help with Character Titles</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-character-titles/555640</link>
    <description>So I dumped the TrisidiaX V3 RSPS (I won&#39;t be working on that.. because of an annoying tree.) and I got Acheron V1 and I&#39;m absolutely digging it. But the creator of this source/client made a typo. He made a bunch of new ranks and crowns and titles. Well, I have access to the crowns, and ranks, but I can&#39;t seem to find the titles. I&#39;ve done a search for &#39;title&#39;, &#39;character-t&#39;, and &#39;character-title&#39;. In the .txt file for MY character, Dax.txt, there is Character-title = 7 which in the game says &quot;Developper Dax&quot; any help on this? I wpuld like to edit some titles.</description>

              <p>The titles are in your client. Search for one of the titles in the Client.java of your client.</p>
