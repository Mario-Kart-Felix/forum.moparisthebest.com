    <title>I have a problem with my 508 character files</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-a-problem-with-my-508-character-files/301680</link>
    <description>ok, i need some help with the character files on the few 508+ sources i have download, everything is in .dat (a dat file). And I have made those files into notepads and then changed to english (from japanese i think) and then i can&#39;t update them, i need to make myself owner, and its impossible for me to do when i can&#39;t update the files, and it keeps reseting my account if i try. So If somebody could help that would be awesome. Thanks.</description>
