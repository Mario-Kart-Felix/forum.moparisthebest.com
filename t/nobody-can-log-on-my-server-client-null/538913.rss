    <title>Nobody can log on my server. Client Null?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nobody-can-log-on-my-server-client-null/538913</link>
    <description>yes, this is delta source. 

I tried to have my friend login to my server, but they can&#39;t. My friend says he is able to log in but gets disconnected right away. 

In the terminal it says, &quot;Connection from &lt;ip address&gt;(some number)  Client Handler: Client Null disconnected &lt;ip address&gt;

... I worked really hard to make this a good server. I really would appreciate soo much if someone could help!! How can I fix this?? It&#39;s probably something so simple.</description>
