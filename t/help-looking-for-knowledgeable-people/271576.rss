    <title>[HELP] Looking For Knowledgeable People</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-looking-for-knowledgeable-people/271576</link>
    <description>

Hello, im the main owner of a very large gaming community with over 3000 followers, private game titles, private game servers, voip servers and dedicated quad core/100mbit uplink servers.
We are currently expanding to runescape hosting.
We want to run a server which is fun to all (just like the real runescape servers)
Were looking for one with a nice large PK area/wilderness – plus nice nonpk area’s for those wishing to actually work up stats... we’re not looking to make it 1hour and your level 99. We want to have a little bit higher than normal leveling, we also want to have some nice mini games (preferably ones from RS)
were looking for a few highly educated people to help get this off the ground.
THIS IS NOT A Two Week Adventure, our gaming community has been online and strong since 2006.
Anyone interested in working with me and our community, please reply to this posting with a little information about yourself.

-Were also looking to make this ran via web-client, not downloadable.</description>
