    <title>Client Closing Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-closing-problem/337848</link>
    <description>Ok so the source and the client are pkplanet. I can do everything fine on the server, but i added something and i wanted my friend to test it with me. he has played other servers before so dont say he doesnt have java or something. Any npc he clicks or if he teles his client closes itself. So whats wrong?

Also when you login it says click here to play with some other stuff so how would i change that because it isnt the spot of the interfaces and stuff.</description>
