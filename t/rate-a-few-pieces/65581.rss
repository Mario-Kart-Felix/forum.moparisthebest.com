<p>Anyway I like the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and the 7th. My favourite would be the 2nd or the 7th though.

              <p>Firstly, stop making me Vs. someone in a battle <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I’ll happily battle though -.-</p>
<p>I think the reason your not a fan of my work, is because I beat you in our little argument. Although, I do agree with somethings you say, but I will try my best to dispute others xD</p>
<blockquote>The first one is a little to plain and the render blends in too much, and i don't like how you put Mr. Chris crammed in the corner.</blockquote>
I agree. I wanted to do something with brushing though, and seeing as those are my favourite brushes, I used them. I went a little overboard with the feathering, I must admit. The text wasn't meant to stand out like some of your work does. It was just meant to go by, barely noticed.
<blockquote>The second one isn't that bad but the colors did get a little crazy from the c4d , and the render and background didn't blend to well, but maybe you were trying to get that effect? Anyways it doesn't look too bad over all. you also forgot text on this one?</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, that’s strange. The second one seems to be the peoples favourite <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I used 3 C4Ds in this one, and I only used one of them multiple times. I like the colours…they seems to fit. The ‘cloudiness’ around the PoP was perfect, I think. I think this one came out really well. The render and the background, like you said, were never meant to blend. All it was, was a render with some C4Ds stuck behind it, and played with some tools, as well as effects. Also, who says text has to be on a signature <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I’m a fan of ‘If you give, you get’. I’m giving you all, who want to be a lazy, a signature, that looks great <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<blockquote>The third one is kind of plain, i just don't like the over all look of it. Not much i can say on this one</blockquote>
<p>I do agree it is kind of plain, but something too busy ruins it. This was rather simple to create, and wasn’t the outcome I wanted, but it was near enough. I just took a stock photo and messed about with the image.</p>
<blockquote>The forth one overall looks pretty good, just not my style though.</blockquote>
<p>The forth one, is O…K…Not great, but it works. I messed up on the smudging a touch. It looks as if I must of had the tool on 100%. I didn’t use one brush on that signature, which you may dispute. I took a stock photo of some weird roof <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<blockquote>The fifth and sixth one isn't that bad actually, it's just a bit on the big side and i am not liking the text at all i think it would of looked better if you did something along these lines.
[img]http://img110.imageshack.us/img110/4580/mrchris11em9.jpg[/img] ;)</blockquote>
<p>The sixth one isn’t big, but I think it’s too bright. With the fifth one, I agree that the canvas is large compared to the average signature size (110x400), but that was because it was my first time JUST using defaults and a render. I wanted room to mess about on it. I agree that the text sucks, but it isn’t any better on your example. Your text is too ‘in your face’ and stands out too much. I’m a fan of little signatures in the corner rather than ‘LOOK AT MY FHKING NAME’. I like the text on the sixth one however.</p>
<blockquote>The seventh one is not that bad, i cant think of anything for you to improve.</blockquote>
<p>I like it too <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<blockquote>And finally the last one i don't like at all, the colors are to crazy and the text got messed up from the scan lines or something..</blockquote>
<p>Yeh, I did go a bit crazy, but the outcome was pretty good. The only thing I would change is the C4Ds at the back (There are just too many of them) and get rid of the brightness, as well as the lens flare on the left. The text got a little messed up, but that fault was on my part. I guess I forgot to switch the layers round <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<blockquote>Sorry if your offended you in any way, i was just pointing out things you can improve, and i understand some or your sigs are meant to look a certain way.</blockquote>
<p>Offended? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I love constructive criticism and it is much appreciated.

              <p>For some reason i was never a big fan of your work, i don’t know why.</p>
<p>The first one is a little to plain and the render blends in too much, and i don’t like how you put Mr. Chris crammed in the corner.</p>
<p>The second one isn’t that bad but the colors did get a little crazy from the c4d , and the render and background didn’t blend to well, but maybe you were trying to get that effect? Anyways it doesn’t look too bad over all. you also forgot text on this one?</p>
<p>The third one is kind of plain, i just don’t like the over all look of it. Not much i can say on this one</p>
<p>The forth one overall looks pretty good, just not my style though.</p>
<p>The fifth and sixth one isn’t that bad actually, it’s just a bit on the big side and i am not liking the text at all i think it would of looked better if you did something along these lines.<br>

<p>The seventh one is not that bad, i cant think of anything for you to improve.</p>
<p>And finally the last one i don’t like at all, the colors are to crazy and the text got messed up from the scan lines or something…</p>
<p>Sorry if your offended you in any way, i was just pointing out things you can improve, and i understand some or your sigs are meant to look a certain way.</p>
