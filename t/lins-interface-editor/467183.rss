    <description>Weird problem with lin&#39;s editor, when I made a scrollable chatbox interface, the scroll bar would only work in game when it was not in the chatbox. Whenever I used frame164 to put it in the chatbox, it would not scroll. Any ideas?</description>

              <p>The client might not support scrollable chat box interfaces. This would be why you see the interfaces with the “Click to show more” options on them. Also note there are two types of chat box interfaces - ones that stay open when you move and ones that don’t. I’m recalling this fact on an old experience, but I’m pretty sure I’ve got it right. One is named ‘action interface’ in some renamed clients and I don’t know about the other.</p>
