    <title>LFT - C++ Text Based Game!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lft-c-text-based-game/444932</link>
    <description>Alright so, since ILikeArrays, kinda just left his project. I&#39;m gonna start it.
&amp; I&#39;m gonna use his template, because I&#39;m not creative ^^
I know as little to C++ to any of you reading and wanna join this team.
But I do know the basics and just a tiny bit more.



[b]Intro:[/b]
The idea is to make a simple console based game using C++. The project is aimed to allow people to learn C++. If you consider yourself to be at the intermediate or pro level of C++ this is not for you. Instead this is for people who have no clue who know what they are doing and are interested in learning C++.

[b]Open Source:[/b]
We will be open source. I still need to check into svn plugins with visual/eclipse. 

[b]Developers:[/b]
[u]MatiasMunk[/u]
Skype: MatiasMunk1995

[b]IDE:[/b]
If your new to C++ and looking for an IDE I&#39;d recommend you to use [url=http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express]Microsoft Visual C++[/url]

[b]The Game:[/b]
So far a game idea still needs to be brainstormed. 

[b]Goals:[/b]
Goals are the most important part of this project and everyone should learn. I will go more into detail on the goals of the project when a game idea gets brainstormed.

[b]Info[/b]
Name: No idea yet
Started: --/--/--

[b]Source[/b]
Will come when project is done.

[b]Other updates[/b]
