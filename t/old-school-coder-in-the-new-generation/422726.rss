    <title>Old school coder in the &quot;New generation&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/old-school-coder-in-the-new-generation/422726</link>
    <description>So I was a coder for 317&#39;s back a long time ago, back when 317&#39;s were all the rage and everyone wanted one. Now we are way beyond that in the 670&#39;s+
I have no clue how to even work a 424 lulz
So If someone could take some time and explain a good noob server that is easy to code and how to begin I&#39;d love it (and make you co-owner on the server if it works online)
Much appreciated.

              <p>I still love 317s - 474s more then 508+. Don’t worry people still love the classics (old rs) or semi classics (317-508).<br>
You can still have a successful 317 if your good. But if you just wanna go up, just download a source that is stable, and learn your way around the files. Since you know how to code, you should be able to find your way around things sooner or later since their aren’t many “teachers” around here.</p>
<p>In Short: Just download a source/client, play around with it, and learn your way around it. Or just stay with 317s, they are still popular in their own right.</p>
