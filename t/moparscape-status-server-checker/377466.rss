    <description>okay this is what it says:

This new page is beta, servers may be added and deleted while I finish it. Thanks for being patient. Post comments about the new page here.

Welcome Tlozoot!
Further Action Required, Read:
New server Lootz-Scape 317 24-7 succesfully entered, however it will not show up on the list until it has been verified and approved.
Your server will now be checked by logging into it with the following credentials:
Username: NOT SHOWING
Password: NOT SHOWING
to make sure it is online, and if successful, it will be posted.
You must register this username and password for me on your server and allow it to be logged into from the IP NOT SHOWING
The server will be deleted from the queue if not verified and logged into within 24 hours of posting.
