    <description>Hey guys!

I haven&#39;t been in the modelling scene really but I decided to give it a shot. I&#39;ve made some other models before this, but this one is the first I feel like showing to the community! What do you guys think? I&#39;d be happy to get some feedback on it.

I must admit, I quite enjoy playing with shapes and making them into neat creations! :)</description>

the reason i actually like this model mostly is because in rs you rarely see people running around with maces maybe if someone added in some decent looking ones and gave them good abilities people would like them<br>

<p>You’ve used too much poly around the spikes, but that is expected from a learner. Instead of getting detail just try to get shape, but this i mean instead of all of the detail added to make the spikes look authentic, just make it detailed enough so that we get the basic shape. With the handle, it is basic but still has too much poly on it considering. All you really need is one or two cuts as the handle is usually covered by the players hand and therefore the user doesn’t see it. As for the chains on the end, you don’t have to make those 3D, it only wastes polly. Try turning those into flat faces and making them doubled sided so that they can still be seen without taking up as much poly. The symbol looks fine, very nice actually considering, thought your method of attachment could have been better. Maybe you could have used half a chain to make it seem attached but this is fine, good for low poly.</p>
<p>Now that you have tried modeling, try colouring it. It would be nice to see what colour palette you added to this, and how well it expresses your ideas.</p>
<p>Good work, never the less. I look forward to seeing more models from you, don’t let negative comments get you down. Everyone in this community has received at least one negative comment toward their work, you just have to accept it and move on because there are others who want to see more.[/quote]</p>

Well… that’s sort of the point of what criticism is… for someone that has shown what he or she has done with something, you know? Just learn from what people are telling you and do better next time, not a big deal.</p>

              <p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>I haven’t been in the modelling scene really but I decided to give it a shot. I’ve made some other models before this, but this one is the first I feel like showing to the community! What do you guys think? I’d be happy to get some feedback on it.</p>

<p>I must admit, I quite enjoy playing with shapes and making them into neat creations! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
