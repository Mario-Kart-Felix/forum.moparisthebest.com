&gt; 10:59 seems like i can control the itch now. Hurts still.
&gt; 11:02 i feel pretty good now gonna get out of this damn thing soon. It&#39;s awesome. I move my head anywhere and still focus on this one spot. Great sensation
&gt; 11:06 My mind is at peace now
 11:14 - i got out of the bathtub... apparently that was my euphoria. i began drying myself off, and i couldn&#39;t stop.. faster, harder, faster, harder... threw the towel and started scratching at my legs. realized what i was doing so i tried as best as i can to finish drying off and walked to my room, while walking.. noticed my legs werent bending. huh. scratching my feet now during the time of typing this out..
`11:23 - gonna go lay down.. might take more logs in my phone again while watching seinfeld

&gt; 12:01 the song made me feel good while watching family guy
&gt; 12:04 watching lois on family guy steal stuff made my lower back itchy lol.. Why is it always about being itchy. Head feels awesome tho
&gt; 12:11 trip is gone i think. Moving my head still feels great. I has a slight tingly feeling&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All in all, apart from the itching.. It was pretty good. I will consider doing it again at a higher dosage since it&#39;s on sale. :D

Surprisingly.. I wasn&#39;t feeling much until I drank the last bit of the bottle. Right then, I immediately left my friends house from playing RE5 and eating popcorn. (Duration between 10:08-10:23)

Thanks to the guys on irc,

              <p>Yeah if you liked it try a higher dose next time. But remember the negative side effects will increase. Maybe you want to consider extracting the dxm.</p>
<p>For itchyness, take a medical dose of diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate when you dose. This will also help combat against nausea as well. Marijuana will greatly increase the dissociative effects of DXM and lower the negative effects. I strongly recommend it.</p>

<p>I went to the loop in Mass and because of all the snow, the snow plowers plowed until there was a giant hill that reached a height over the movie theater. My friend and I decided to climb it, I was the first up, and when I was there, I felt like Rocky and just started jumping and punching the air. Fun day.</p>

<p>All in all, apart from the itching… It was pretty good. I will consider doing it again at a higher dosage since it’s on sale. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Surprisingly… I wasn’t feeling much until I drank the last bit of the bottle. Right then, I immediately left my friends house from playing RE5 and eating popcorn. (Duration between 10:08-10:23)</p>
<p>Thanks to the guys on irc,<br>
