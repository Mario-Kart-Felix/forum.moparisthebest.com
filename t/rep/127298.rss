    <title>Rep</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rep/127298</link>
    <description>Ok, I just want to get a few questions answered.

Q1: Besides repping the same person each week, what is considered rep abuse?

Q2: What is considered a bad reason to rep someone?

Q3: Is it bad to give out rep to more than 2-3 members every few weeks?

Q4: Can you rep someone for finding their post so funny its hard to forget?

If it is against the rules to try and understand rep, I&#39;m sorry and I won&#39;t do it again. I just would like to know before I screw up and things go downhill.

Also note: I used the search and didn&#39;t find anything. I also apologize if this has already been posted.</description>

              <p>Well, Azn did it for the hell of it. I did it because people always complained about rep, and people with high up rep always made fun of people(I couldn’t figure out why?). Then I came to the conclusion, if everybody had rep, then how can they make fun of them? If you noticed, people stoped arguing over it for the most part.<br>
But I’m still wondering if Melissa got banned for abusing the TOS by asking for rep on MSN?</p>

<p>Indeed, it did state that discussing rep was forbidden, but it was decided that that was a bit strict and unnecessary.  Now, only asking for rep is forbidden.</p>

              <p>I’ve reset a couple people’s rep in the past for giving rep randomly and for no reason to tons of people…I would consider that rep abuse as well.  Basically, as long as you have a good enough reason and you feel that someone deserves the rep, we won’t generally pick on it.</p>
<p>Also, its not against the rules to talk about rep…you’re just not allowed to blatantly ask for it.  I would note, though, that openly using rep as an incentive to get others to help you or answer your questions is also discouraged.</p>

              <p>I’m no mod, but I’ll still state my opinion.</p>
<p>Q1: basically the answer to Q4.  and Q4 is the answer to Q2.</p>
<p>Abuse is giving it for bad reasons, such as finding their post “funny” (when most of the time it is just moronic).</p>
<p>Q3:  If the members really deserve it, and look like they are going out of their way to give a helping hand, then its ok.  If they just answer a question like ‘how can I make writing in photoshop’ with ‘use the text tool’, then they obviously didn’t spend too much time on the answer.</p>

              <p>Ok, I just want to get a few questions answered.</p>
<p>Q1: Besides repping the same person each week, what is considered rep abuse?</p>
<p>Q2: What is considered a bad reason to rep someone?</p>
<p>Q3: Is it bad to give out rep to more than 2-3 members every few weeks?</p>
<p>Q4: Can you rep someone for finding their post so funny its hard to forget?</p>
<p>If it is against the rules to try and understand rep, I’m sorry and I won’t do it again. I just would like to know before I screw up and things go downhill.</p>
<p>Also note: I used the search and didn’t find anything. I also apologize if this has already been posted.</p>
