    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rep/343283</link>
    <description>You can rep++ to 13 (correct me if i&#39;m wrong)

But only rep-- to 1.

If you would like to help the rep system a little bit better, that would be a good way.


Discuss about &quot;Rep--&quot; and ideas for it.</description>

<p>I can personally say that they shouldn’t touch the rep-- but they should increase the rep++ to 250, and when they reach 200 that 1+ rep would be half of what normal rep would be for those under 200 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> that would be motherfucking hard though. too much interfereance with the template and main php <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

<p>No, no, no, no, we don’t need to raise or lower it. We need a new system that gives the rep+ to a responsible amount of the community to give out when it is really needed and not for a tutorial on how to add shops or a help thread about fixing a ncp spawn. It should be given in the rare events when someone truly does something above and beyond what others are doing, like writing a tutorial on how a API works and how you could implement it into a private server or even not server related just general programming.[/quote]You’re one to talk.

I would never raise the limit above 200, there is no need to.  I would also never reset rep again, refer to Taharok’s quote as to why.

Change the handout amount from 15 to 25 or 30[/quote]I agree. People shouldn’t be able to rep++ just because someone with 100 or more rep gave them some reputation.</p>

<p>I still like the idea that has been said where people can choose how much rep they want to give, as long as it is below or at the amount they are allowed to give. (13 and below for people with 200 rep etc)</p>

<p>We discuss bad choices of parliament, bad taxes because those are valid and important things pertaining to real life. Rep is an invalid number which can define how much you have contributed to the community/how much you have sucked up. It always ends up in flame wars with people who care way too much about this number so the discussion is rendered useless because everyone goes off topic.[/quote]It doesn’t need to be that way.

[/quote]Hence the reason the OP said ‘discuss’.<br>
[/quote]I’m saying what’s the point in discussing something that’s incredibly unlikely to change… I know what he said.<br>
[/quote]We discuss the bad choices of the president all of the time (not neccesarily on this forum) and other people of power even though that is incredibly unlikely to change. We discuss the bad taxes. Whats wrong with discussing something that will not change?[/quote]</p>
<p>We discuss bad choices of parliament, bad taxes because those are valid and important things pertaining to real life. Rep is an invalid number which can define how much you have contributed to the community/how much you have sucked up. It always ends up in flame wars with people who care way too much about this number so the discussion is rendered useless because everyone goes off topic.</p>
