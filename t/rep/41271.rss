<p>this was because low level people were repping everyone they could find basicaly. Thats why it was disabled because people were getting so much rep from people. I like the new method because it stops this and some people can still rep. This makes it so no one gets 100 rep from making 5 tuts that everyone who has over 20 post likes and decides to give you rep…</p>
<p>Note: I dont like talking about rep but he asked and i answered him <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
