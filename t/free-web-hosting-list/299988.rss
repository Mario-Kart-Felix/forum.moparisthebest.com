              <p>Not to put your topic down but free hosting is pretty much useless. Its almost always a bad service; downtime, speed, functions, limits. If you want hosting you should just fork out the couple of pound for paid hosting service and save with all the fuss of a free host. And you can always just use amp on your computer.</p>
