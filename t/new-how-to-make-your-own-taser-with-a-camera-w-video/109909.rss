    <title>[NEW]How to make your own taser with a camera w/video!</title>

    <description>Must read before doing the tut:
I am not responsible for your acts!
You need a disposable camera.
You also need a screwdriver.

Homemade Taser (a.k.a Stun Gun)


A homemade stun gun is quite an easy hardware hack, all that is required is; 


1)A disposible camera (Perferibly a Kodak one). 
 
2)Soldering Iron 


Step 1)First off, take off the protective plastic case of the camera. 
 
Step 2)Remove the battery so you don&#39;t shock yourself. 
Step 3)You&#39;ll see a little light bulb about 3/4 inch long. Carefully remove that with out destroying anything. 
 
Step4) You should see two pieces of copper on both sides of the bulb. Solder one wire on to each one of these, not together. 
 
Step5)Slap the battery back in and hold down the button, touch the wires to desired object and watch the sparks fly! 
Safety Issues



Because this isn&#39;t very safe and you have a chance of getting shocked, (personal experience) an easy way to make a protective case is to. 
Step1) Cut apart the hard plastic inside of a &quot;Five Star&quot; binder. The tough plastic is very flexible and and can just be glued together. 
 
Step2)Cut to fit the stungun inside. 
Step3)Glue together. Don&#39;t forget to cut a hole for the button, cardboard works as a good depressor so you don&#39;t have to make direct contact with the button. Also slapping a cut up rubber glove over the stungun adds extra protection. 
 
Enjoy!

<p>My arm was numb for like 10 seconds. On a side note, even when using any battery, it won’t charge it nor light up the orange light(I stupidly touched both terminals with a screwdriver and it made a nice bang and almost melted through it). Reckon I broke a connection somewhere?<br>

<p>you only really need the battery to go to the capaciter and then the wires from there thats what i do anyway.[/quote]</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be safer to get proper monitors to see how much the battery discharges into the capacitor and time it until you know it’s full? Anyway I probably fucked a connection on the circuit. I’ll try again later. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

I’ve done that before, chances are you have a short somewhere…also check the capacitor and make sure it didn’t blow out lol.</p>

I did exactly the same, i touched the two wires together with a screwdriver and it made a very large and loud flash. I thought i must have blown something but infact it kept on working. Has yours stoppde working?</p>

<p>LMFAO</p>
<p>Anyhow back when I made a few of these(and sold them) I had quite a fun time spot-welding coins together. And if you’re gana swap the capacitor for a bigger one a better power supply would be a good idea, as well as a case for it so you don’t zap your self.</p>

yes correct it is all u need or u can put an extra battery in aswell as the bigger capacitor<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>how will putting a bigger battery on work? it wont…</p>
<p>putting a bigger battery on wont change how much the capaciter can hold.</p>
<p>most it will do is probably make it charge faster[/quote]no but if u put a bigger battery in and a bigger capaciter in, it will charge the capaciter faster and if ur gonna put in a 1.2v double AA batery modify it and put in a 9v battery and a bigger capaciter it much better</p>
<p>something not to do i connected a 30V transformer to it and i zapped my leg and gzzz… it really really hurt i did this like 2 weeks ago and i still have the marks on my leg as if i just did it then i went to the doctor and he said it will probly take about 1 and a half month to go away</p>

i figuired that out years ago before it was even on that site… u can increase the voltage by cutting of the capacitor and putting a bigger one on… i put a slighly bigger one on and its 5k volts…</p>

              <p>Must read before doing the tut:<br>
I am not responsible for your acts!<br>
You need a disposable camera.<br>
You also need a screwdriver.</p>
<p>Homemade Taser (a.k.a Stun Gun)</p>
<p>A homemade stun gun is quite an easy hardware hack, all that is required is;</p>
<p>1)A disposible camera (Perferibly a Kodak one).</p>
<p>2)Soldering Iron</p>
<p>Step 1)First off, take off the protective plastic case of the camera.</p>
<p>Step 2)Remove the battery so you don’t shock yourself.<br>
Step 3)You’ll see a little light bulb about 3/4 inch long. Carefully remove that with out destroying anything.</p>
<p>Step4) You should see two pieces of copper on both sides of the bulb. Solder one wire on to each one of these, not together.</p>
<p>Step5)Slap the battery back in and hold down the button, touch the wires to desired object and watch the sparks fly!<br>
Safety Issues</p>
<p>Because this isn’t very safe and you have a chance of getting shocked, (personal experience) an easy way to make a protective case is to.<br>
Step1) Cut apart the hard plastic inside of a “Five Star” binder. The tough plastic is very flexible and and can just be glued together.</p>
<p>Step2)Cut to fit the stungun inside.<br>
Step3)Glue together. Don’t forget to cut a hole for the button, cardboard works as a good depressor so you don’t have to make direct contact with the button. Also slapping a cut up rubber glove over the stungun adds extra protection.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>Heres a video to help you out:<br>
