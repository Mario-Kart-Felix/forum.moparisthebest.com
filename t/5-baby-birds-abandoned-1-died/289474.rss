    <title>5 Baby birds abandoned; 1 died</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/5-baby-birds-abandoned-1-died/289474</link>
    <description>So I recently found that there were 5 baby birds in the nest I bought, and the mother didn&#39;t come much, she rarely came. So when she completely stopped, my mom and I took the birds into the house, all went fine until last night. I fed them before I went to sleep, and I had to keep waking up at night to keep feeding them. I thought 2 of them had died, but I was wrong. 1 of the birds was *somehow* attached onto the dead bird with some kind of string that I never gave them. Well, I got that untangled now. It was on his leg and on his neck, he had it on all night although I was being a fucking idiot and thought that the bird was clinging onto the dead bird for respect or something.

He&#39;s doing well now, but hes not moving and I think he might have a broken neck. His eyes or open and he&#39;s not moving, although I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s alive. If anyone has any tips for me, PLEASE post!</description>

<p>Also what are you feeding them?</p>
