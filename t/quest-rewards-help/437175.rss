    <title>Quest rewards help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quest-rewards-help/437175</link>
    <description>I was going through my client, seeing what quests are there, before I begin tearing them apart. 
I got one called Rune Mysteries completed (Though according to RS Wiki this is not a proper quest), and got the reward screen, but without any of the rewards showing. Rewards were given, but instead of on the scroll, a message was sent saying what I got. 
How do you make it to where the rewards show on the scroll, rather than a message?
