    <title>Should I upgrade to Vista Ultimate?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-i-upgrade-to-vista-ultimate/63980</link>
    <description>Hey,

     Sorry I haven&#39;t been on in a while, I just got my new computer a while ago because I dropped my old computer on purpose, it was worth it and just got this new one. Almost everything has changed since i left, some for worse, some for better, and I was thinking since this community has never wronged me before, I should come to you guys for my question, SHOULD I UPGRADE TO VISTA? Heres my PC stats, because if I do upgrade it&#39;s gonna be Ultimate:

232GB Hard Drive
3.01GHZ Intel Pentium Processor 4
1024MB RAM
DVD Burner

The recommended stats are:

    * 1 GHz 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor
    * 1 GB of system memory
    * 40 GB hard drive with at least 15 GB of available space
    * Support for DirectX 9 graphics with:
          o WDDM Driver
          o 128 MB of graphics memory (minimum)
          o Pixel Shader 2.0 in hardware
          o 32 bits per pixel
    * DVD-ROM
    * Audio Output
    * Internet access (fees may apply) 

Anyways, I know I CAN run vista with know problems, but the question is should I. My friend slapped me in the face when I asked him and gave me a 20pg summary of complaints and reasons I SHOULDN&#39;T upgrade. I&#39;m downloading Vista Ultimate now, so if you think I should I will. If you think I should, please tell me why, ditto for the not.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Edge of I-Hacked”]IT LOOKS LIKE Microsoft’s unhackable OS activation malware has been hacked.</p>
<p>There is an active thread at the Keznews forums (account needed), and a summary on its main page about the crack.</p>
<p>It is a simple brute force attack, dumb as a rock that just tries keys. If it gets one, you manually have to check it and try activation. Is is ugly, takes hours, is far from point and click, but it is said to work. I don’t have any Vista installs because of the anti-user licensing so I have not tested it personally.</p>
<p>The method of attack has got to be quite troubling for MS on many grounds. The crack is a glorified guesser, and with the speed of modern PCs and the number of outstanding keys, the 25-digit serials are within range. The biggest problem for MS? If this gets widespread, and I hope it will, people will start activating legit keys that are owned by other people</p>
<p>It won’t take long for boxes bought at retail to be activated before they are bought, and the people who plunk down money for the mal^h^h^hsoftware for real get ‘you are a filthy pirate’ messages. Won’t that be a laugh riot at the MS phone banks in Bangalore.[/quote]</p>

Vista Ultimate costs almost as much as my computer did, and the central driving philosophy behind it seems to be somewhere between “pay more to do less” and “Vista knows best. Trust Us.”</p>
<p>This is meant as a joke, but it hits so close to home…<br>

<p>Vista ultimate cost’s £99 here in england, Like to see you get a brand new computer close to £99[/quote]</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your money is worth nearly twice mine <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Around here the Vista Ultimate UPGRADE runs about 250 USD and the full version is closer to 400 USD. Here, THIS is a valid offer:</p>
<p><img src="http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/2264/stupdidd0.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Why would anyone ever pay so much money for software that is <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> the only option?</p>
<p>I understand (some) high prices for high-end specialty programs, but a word processor? Why does their Office suite cost $150+ more than the operating system itself (<span class="bbcode-i">actually</span> more than my computer cost)?</p>
<p>When you add the cost of new hardware (Vista would make any system in my house explode), time spent coping with DRM that likes to accuse legitimate customers of piracy and disable their computers, and the increasing closure of the system to non-Microsoft products in general (beginning with security, scarily enough), Vista in any incarnation is simply impractical.</p>
<p>If you’re curious, my computer cost about 550 USD.</p>

Still, why pay for something when you can get something 10x better for free. You would go to the supermarket, and buy a pack of 5 rotten potatoes over a pack of 50 fresh ones.</p>

They can now see what you are doing as the os comes with a built in keylogger, besides I already have all those addons for xp.</p>

Hey,</p>
<pre><code> Sorry I haven't been on in a while, I just got my new computer a while ago because I dropped my old computer on purpose, it was worth it and just got this new one. Almost everything has changed since i left, some for worse, some for better, and I was thinking since this community has never wronged me before, I should come to you guys for my question, SHOULD I UPGRADE TO VISTA? Heres my PC stats, because if I do upgrade it's gonna be Ultimate:
</code></pre>
<p>232GB Hard Drive<br>
3.01GHZ Intel Pentium Processor 4<br>
1024GB RAM<br>
DVD Burner</p>
<p>The recommended stats are:</p>
<pre><code>* 1 GHz 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor
* 1 GB of system memory
* 40 GB hard drive with at least 15 GB of available space
* Support for DirectX 9 graphics with:
      o WDDM Driver
      o 128 MB of graphics memory (minimum)
      o Pixel Shader 2.0 in hardware
      o 32 bits per pixel
* DVD-ROM
* Audio Output
* Internet access (fees may apply) 
</code></pre>
<p>Anyways, I know I CAN run vista with know problems, but the question is should I. My friend slapped me in the face when I asked him and gave me a 20pg summary of complaints and reasons I SHOULDN’T upgrade. I’m downloading Vista Ultimate now, so if you think I should I will. If you think I should, please tell me why, ditto for the not.<br>
[/quote]<br>
WOW 1024GB ram? you mean 1024MB…<br>
and yes do upgrade, its alot less laggy then xp, i have had it for 4 months now, and i havent had a single virus/worm/keylogger the firewall on vista is so good, that when you GET a keylogger, the keylogger asks for permission to send data, so you click [quote]keep blocking [/quote] and it stops the keylogger :P[/quote]</p>
<p>Most good xp firewalls ask for your permission when something asks to get access to the net. The default xp firewall sucks. Only blocks attacks.</p>
