    <title>How can i add things to the in game chat box? (i hope i can explain well enough)</title>

    <description>Hey everyone :)

Basically, i was wondering if there was any way you can add to the in game chat box, for example adding things to your name or after your name, and if its server or client sided.

I was basically hoping to add titles for fun, such as [Server First Beast Killer] or whatever, it would look like this: ([blah]: as in playername)

[Blah]: blah blah blah
[BlahBlah]: blah blah blah

and i want to change it to somthing like:

[Blah][Server First Beast Killer]: blah blah blah
[Blah][Server First Beast Killer]: blah blah

...etc..

Is there any way to edit that? i&#39;d guess it would be somthing like +playerName +&quot;: &quot; &lt;text&gt; &quot;); or somthing... heh :P

If anyone can help at all thanks so much :) even if its telling me you cant do that :).</description>
