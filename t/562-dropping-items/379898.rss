    <title>[562] Dropping items?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-dropping-items/379898</link>
    <description>Hey I need some help.

I finally got the wild working in my 562 server. But when one player kills another, the player who died doesn&#39;t drop any pvp items nor lose any items.

What file(s) do I need to edit? I spent several hours trying to fix pvp drops, make a working general store and transfer my server to a linux (Ubuntu) VPS. All with no luck. Anyone want to help?</description>
