    <title>Need some help getting started with a school assignment</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-help-getting-started-with-a-school-assignment/509488</link>
    <description>I&#39;ll give you the basics of it:

We were supposed to download a jar file, add it to out project as an external jar - easy enough
-The jar has 4 .class files which all have a constructor and various methods

Each class file is a various &quot;collection&quot; meaning one is cards, one is music, one is spoons from landmarks, and the last is video games.

Our job is to create a basic program that can serve as a collection for all the class files. Our teacher told us he also may be adding other .class files in the jar at a later time. The point of that being that our program should be able to take new forms of collections with various edits.

This is probably the most difficult program we have had to do and I&#39;m lost atm. I&#39;m sure most of you guys are like ffs marcbob wtf it&#39;s easy you idiot

I don&#39;t even get the point of the jar file. I have never done anything with one before. How am I supposed to use the constructors and methods in it? Also, what would be the best way to approach this project?
-If you&#39;re really up for helping me on this I could send you word for word the entire project assignment and the jar file. I may pay you a few bucks for helping, but I want to do most of this myself so I learn</description>

<p>That server was only good for it’s time. I drained like $100 into running Arrav after it shutdown and then the original Owner found out and made me shut down. Haven’t ran a server since that because I don’t feel like using start up money or working on a server.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@TOPIC</span>: This topic is old but I figured it out and if anyone wants the code I can send you it. It was actually not that hard to do once I figured out what to do.</p>

<p>:fp:</p>
<p>BaseballCards[] collection;<br>
?<br>
Object[] generalCollection;<br>
^ no idea if that works lol</p>
<p><code>		ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; gcol = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;();
		gcol.add(new Color(0));
		gcol.add(new JFrame("Heya!"));
		gcol.add("MIKU HATSUNE IS AWESOME!");</code><br>
That’s probably the best you can do.<br>
EDIT: see if they all extend the same class (which is why Object works always)<br>
The reason why Object works on all those different objects is because every object in Java is a direct or indirect extension of java.lang.Object.</p>

<p>No lol. I can see where you think that, but he literally wants us to implement a collection meaning baseball cards and that sort of thing. Literally things a person collects and then we need to maintain them.</p>
<p>I’m trying to do this with an ArrayList of types of the jar, but I am getting a runtime error when trying to make a constructor from a class in the jar file. I’ll figure it out hopefully.</p>

</aside>
<p>First of all, you don’t import a jar, you include them into your class path. Secondly, if you’re using a 3rd party jar and don’t know what it contains then you have issues, there are Javadocs for a reason.[/quote]</p>
<p>Import is more of a child word for the whole input concept; I doubt his teacher made any sort of docs for his jar which is why I said to decompile.</p>

<p>First of all, you don’t import a jar, you include them into your class path. Secondly, if you’re using a 3rd party jar and don’t know what it contains then you have issues, there are Javadocs for a reason.</p>

<p>No I have the jar imported fine and everything and can see all it’s methods. I understand now I can extend the class files in the jar and have access to their methods.</p>
<p>The issue I’m having is finding a way to keep track of all the “collections” like it is asking. Should I use an Array or an ArrayList and how should I go about doing it?</p>
<p>The 4 kinds of collections are souvenir spoons, old video games, music, and baseball cards. I need to make a program that can easily take input of more collections and manage them all so you can remove one from a list. Then I need to be able to show the oldest and newest item, cheapest, most valuable. Then i need to be able to get a total and average value of the collection.</p>
<p>So I’m just failing to see how I should take the user input in the constructor of like one kind of collection and do it similarly for the other. They all are done differently.</p>

              <p>I’ll give you the basics of it:</p>
<p>We were supposed to download a jar file, add it to out project as an external jar - easy enough<br>
-The jar has 4 .class files which all have a constructor and various methods</p>
<p>Each class file is a various “collection” meaning one is cards, one is music, one is spoons from landmarks, and the last is video games.</p>
<p>Our job is to create a basic program that can serve as a collection for all the class files. Our teacher told us he also may be adding other .class files in the jar at a later time. The point of that being that our program should be able to take new forms of collections with various edits.</p>
<p>This is probably the most difficult program we have had to do and I’m lost atm. I’m sure most of you guys are like ffs marcbob wtf it’s easy you idiot</p>
<p>I don’t even get the point of the jar file. I have never done anything with one before. How am I supposed to use the constructors and methods in it? Also, what would be the best way to approach this project?<br>
-If you’re really up for helping me on this I could send you word for word the entire project assignment and the jar file. I may pay you a few bucks for helping, but I want to do most of this myself so I learn</p>
