    <title>[Protocol Question] How does this song work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/protocol-question-how-does-this-song-work/552580</link>
    <description>Decided to ask here because mopar generally tends to have smarter people lol.

How does this work? I have heard that RuneScape supports only MIDI files, but this song has lyrics and has real instruments, so how is this working?

This song is in 718+.

Hope I get informative responses!

Odd. All the music editors we have (even in these revisions) only have .midi support, not to mention all the songs sound like MIDI files until you start hearing these songs with real instruments and real vocals. I know these are real and not just “seemingly real” because when they introduced the quest to have these types of songs, they stated:</p>

              <p>They changed the system to allow regular mp3 IIRC (or at least changed it away from pure MIDI, that much I know) with the introduction of some quests &amp; voices. I don’t remember what the full answer was, but I saw this asked recently and basically with some quest that introduced voices they had to add support for other sound files</p>
