<p>sorry, I would not recommend doing this, I was mistaken when I said this</p>
<p>a police of the rank inspector or higher is requires to perform a cavity search, as far as I’m aware any police officer can do a regular ‘pat down’ search</p>
<p>again I am not a lawyer, if you want solid legal advise I suggest you go see one</p>

<p>You’re the ignorant one I’m afraid. I suggest you grow up and pull your head in. The world isn’t against you, stop playing the victim. You’re the joke ‘buddy’.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>so lets break this down, despite having a legal right to resist an unlawful search or arrest, if the search was lawful then refusing to comply you will likely face much more severe charges than what the alleged probable cause would find, such as <a href="http://www.lawhandbook.sa.gov.au/ch10s05s03s02.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a></p>
<p>so, what constitutes an unlawful search or arrest? when there is no probable cause, so, what is probable cause defined as? that’s the problem, probable cause in most countries isn’t rigidly defined and a bunch of laws (such as drug laws) don’t help the case, probable cause can apply to damn near every situation which is why most law advise websites will advise against resisting a search or arrest (note: only an inspector or above can perform a search in Australia, but please for the love of god this is not legal advise I am not a lawyer)</p>
<p>what your situation does sound like may be considered harassment so I really do suggest you take a visit to a citizens advise bureau or a lawyer if you want to see if there’s something to do about it, such as making a formal complaint (citizens advise bureaus over here in the UK are free and I imagine the same is true for Australia)</p>
<p>since you said you have resisted arrest before and the police do know who you are then yes they do have probable cause</p>

              <p>you’d be best off consulting the citizens advise bureau for what to do during a stop and search and whether or not it’s police harassment (given that you’re a minor) but yeah, a criminal history is definitely probable cause for a crime</p>

              <p>Thanks for the link, I was having a really hard time locating anything with some good reliable information that isn’t extremely generalized. Does anyone have an idea of what I could say to them next time I get randomly stopped for a search while walking through the area?</p>
<p>EDIT: Also would previous offences affect whether they have probable cause to do the search or not? Whether they be a caution for a previous drug offence (tiny amount of marijuana) or criminal offences while I was a minor (still a minor [16]) criminal offences include 14 counts of break and enter when i was in grade 9 and there was unlawful use of a motor vehicle earlier this year when i was 15 (stealing a car) and also obstructing police by trying to out run them on foot if it matters what offences they are.</p>

<p>although you legally can, the absolute worse thing you could attempt to do would be to resist the search</p>
<p>if you get in touch with your citizens advise bureau and explain the situation they should be able to help you make a formal complaint</p>
