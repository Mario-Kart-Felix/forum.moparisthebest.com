-Wilderness-
-All Wildernes pvp combat is working
-Once killed a player you will recieve 100 Pvp Tokens, but in this case its called Archery Tickets which will be used as the pvp currency, this will be used on the Pk shop. You will also lose all your items if you were to die, and all the items you loose the winner will be able to claim. you cannot be part of staff and contribute to pvp, considering the face that you will not loose your items and you will not drop anything.
