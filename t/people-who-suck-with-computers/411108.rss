    <description>I love people who can&#39;t do well with computers, you can take advantage of them and make them get sooo scared and make them believe anything that isn&#39;t. Today at school this one girl ran a program for something and a CMD box came up and words were coming fast and shes like OMG WhAT HAPPENDD??? I said WTF THATS A VIRUS HOW DID YOU GET THAT!!!

Anyone ever take advantage over someone who aren&#39;t that good with computers.</description>
