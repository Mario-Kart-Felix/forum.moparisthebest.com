<p>What a retarded post. Help the damn guy, search bar doesn’t work most of the time. (At least for me)</p>
<p>It’s in your client class, search for the one you have right now and just change it.</p>

<p>Epic, please dont refrane yourself to keep doing this, all it does is make you unrespected to alot of people, also i know this has been posted many times. Yet, when people are JUST beginning programming servers its clueless to them.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@TOPIC</span> - yea use the CTRL+F command, and search your client.java for it.[/quote]<br>

Epic, please don’t refrain yourself to keep doing this. (MAKES NO SENSE.)<br>
All it does is… blah blah blah.</p>
<p>–People seriously NEED TO LEARN TO SEARCH BEFORE POSTING.<br>
It’s partially a rule… And I still help people.<br>
AND I’m allowed to have my fun whilst doing so.<br>
NOTE: Epic, please refrain yourself from doing this again. --Proper way to say that.</p>
