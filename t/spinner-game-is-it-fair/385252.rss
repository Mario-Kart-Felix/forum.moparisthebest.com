    <title>Spinner Game - Is it fair?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/spinner-game-is-it-fair/385252</link>
    <description>My algebra 2 and trig teacher had us do an MCAS prep day. We got separated into groups and had to figure out if the game was fair or not. The game is: There are two players and a spinner. Player 1 adds the numbers together, and player 2 multiplies them. The players spin the spinner twice to get the two numbers. The player with the higher number wins.

The numbers on the spinner are 1, -2, 3, -4, 5, and -6.

Every group decided the game was unfair because the person adding always had a higher chance of winning. Among the groups 3 of 8 said there were 36 possible combinations and the other 5 groups said that there were only 21 combinations because the numbers can repeat. (EX: spinning a 1 and a -6 is the same as a -6 and a 1.) We were asked to figure out which option is right. I personally think that it is 36 combinations because even though the numbers repeat, it&#39;s still a possible option. I&#39;m just looking to see what others think.</description>

<p>Thats a chart I did.</p>
<ul>
<li>= multiply wins</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>= add wins</li>
</ul>
<p>In that chart + wins 23 and * wins 13. Did you take out even more repeats?</p>
