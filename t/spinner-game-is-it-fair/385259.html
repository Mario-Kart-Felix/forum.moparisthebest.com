        <p>My algebra 2 and trig teacher had us do an MCAS prep day. We got separated into groups and had to figure out if the game was fair or not. The game is: There are two players and a spinner. Player 1 adds the numbers together, and player 2 multiplies them. The players spin the spinner twice to get the two numbers. The player with the higher number wins.</p>
<p>The numbers on the spinner are 1, -2, 3, -4, 5, and -6.</p>
<p>Every group decided the game was unfair because the person adding always had a higher chance of winning. Among the groups 3 of 8 said there were 36 possible combinations and the other 5 groups said that there were only 21 combinations because the numbers can repeat. (EX: spinning a 1 and a -6 is the same as a -6 and a 1.) We were asked to figure out which option is right. I personally think that it is 36 combinations because even though the numbers repeat, it’s still a possible option. I’m just looking to see what others think.</p>
<p>[code]     1 -2 3 -4 5 -6</p>
<p>1   +  +  +  +  +  +<br>
-2  +  *  +  *  +  *<br>
3   +  +  *  +  *  +<br>
-4  +  *  +  *  +  *<br>
5   +  +  *  +  *  +<br>
-6  +  *  +  *  +  *[/code]</p>
<p>Thats a chart I did.</p>
<ul>
<li>= multiply wins</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>= add wins</li>
</ul>
<p>In that chart + wins 23 and * wins 13.</p>
<p>I posted this on moparisthebest but didn’t get much of a response. I’m going to bed and I decided on 36, but feel free to discuss and tell me which is right.</p>

        <p>I guess it really depends on your teacher. It doesn’t seem like the question was given with enough information to come to a conclusive answer.</p>
