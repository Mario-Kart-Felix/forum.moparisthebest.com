    <title>Castle PKing Thought?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/castle-pking-thought/401194</link>
    <description>Since most of the &quot;PK-ing&quot; is done in Dragon Maze/ Mage Arena. I Think it would be a nice change for MOST of the PK-ing to be done at the castle? Im not saying like.. lvl 100s+ at castle. i mean like.. LVL:&quot;20-70&quot; And making rune actually something worth getting. Because if you PK a r2h/Dlong/ETC and you know its not that hard to get. it&#39;s not as rewarding. If you know it&#39;s hard to obtain the item, then it&#39;ll give you a stronger feeling on what PK-ing is mostly about.


What do you think? ;)</description>

              <p>What made castle pking active was the skiddes picking up the runes located inside the castle…<br>
Just bump up the amount of runes spawned there and make runes less available in the server.</p>
<p>I know people say “pk server should of infinite amount of runes”. Your going to need to create some balance between the 2 arguments. Just remember, in rsc magic was earned and leaned towards the rich players who wanted to burn money.</p>

              <p>The best pking apart from the real deal, has always been at castle, specifically RSCE during the no rs2 fagboy days when edge wild and castle was always packed. If this area is jumping, there really isnt any need for any other places, u have castle where every one gravitates towards, with enough levels to border to get caught dead, the area midway, and border. Thats all you need.</p>
<p>What you dont need is to promote training/farming spots in the wild as pking. When both parties are geared out and looking for a fight, thats pking…and thats what castle is for once all the grinding and farming is done in these other areas.</p>

<p>What do you think? ;)[/quote]<br>
The only server “alive” is ONLY castle pking… and it’s been like this since the release. So every server that gets released people ONLY want pking at maze\altar\mage arena</p>
<p>Also, main pking at the maze is nice IF the “main” spot to get RUNE items is in there. Makes items harder to get + tons of pking… Should make 2 exits to be honest though… Because after someone dies 3-4x in there they get sick of it\rage because there is only 1 exit… So they either quit or just stay out of wild period.</p>
