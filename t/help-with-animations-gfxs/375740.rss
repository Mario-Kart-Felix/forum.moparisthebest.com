    <title>Help with animations &amp; gfx&#39;s?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-animations-gfxs/375740</link>
    <description>Ok I just added rune knives to my server and I am a bit technical. It correctly shows him throwing the knife, but only while not attacking and in the air after being thrown. When he is in lets say step one of throwing with the arm raised in the air, it&#39;s just a fist.

Did I do something wrong, or what did I miss? Can I make him actually hold the knife in the air before he throws it?

Before you shoot an arrow, it shows it in the bow, so how before I throw a knife or dart, can I show the knife.
