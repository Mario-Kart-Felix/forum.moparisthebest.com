    <title>Need help with tabs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-tabs/345493</link>
    <description>Hi! I own a 317, I&#39;ve been coding it for awhile now, but I still come across one issue.. I do not have any idea how to add tabs that you can teleport with.  Could anyone give me a code for one?  I already know How to change the name of them, I just want to know how to Make them do things.

Thanks in advance
