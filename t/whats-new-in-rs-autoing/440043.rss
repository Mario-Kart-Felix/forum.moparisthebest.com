    <title>What&#39;s New In RS Autoing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-new-in-rs-autoing/440043</link>
    <description>Hey all, its been a LONG time since I have played and I was thinking about autoing again. Are there new bots around? Any ones to avoid?

Also: I remember they had an update where you cant trade stuff for free, is that still around?</description>

<p>For the moment, and most of the near future, I would avoid most java bots in general as they all seem to be a bit shady… People claim they’ve been hacked after using them, stuff like that. Simba/Scar is still around and working as it always has</p>
<p>Free trade is gone now and you can trade freely, except on new accounts, they’ll have limits until made members</p>
