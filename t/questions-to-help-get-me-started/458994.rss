    <title>Questions to help get me started</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/questions-to-help-get-me-started/458994</link>
    <description>Hello, this is my first time posting and I’d like to ask a few questions to get started with making Rsps. The last thing I want to be is another person who asks a ton of obvious questions that annoys more advanced coders/developers. It’d be great if I could get some advice on how to start, simply because this has interested me for a long time and don’t normally enjoy any servers anymore, they all seem neglected by staff, the community is horrible and the items that ruined RS are always there for prices that only donators could afford.

I’ve noticed how all the servers today try to keep updated with runescape which doesn’t make much sense in my opinion, I thought nex armors, SOF, Dicing, etc was what killed Rs and the joy we once got from it. I want to be that one of the few people who still believes every server shouldn’t have a master command, donate for all the good benefits, and nothing past 07 really.

To get started I really don’t know much I’ve been trying to get a grasp on the terms used, what will be good to start with, etc...

[b]Questions[/b]:
So question one would be wheres a good place to start with learning to code my own content, I have no prior experience and just here for suggestions. I’ve read jumping straight into it isn’t a good approach.

I’ve narrowed it down to Delta being a good starter to learn from, I’ve also learned that PI is extremely overused and want to get away from the norm, along with the fact its for more experienced people. I want to be original and actually learn how things work such as teleports, skills and how they function, just everything really.

Like I said I want to stick with something like a 317 sense that’s apparently a good starter, I’m also curious as to the differences between a 459 and 474. I only want updates prior to bounty hunter and clan wars while still having classic Wilderness that we’ve all come to love. I believe in a heavily PvM based server while giving people a chance to pk and have fun without overpowered weapons and gear.

I’m also curious as to what exactly can be “ripped” from servers such as maps and other content. I was wondering if it was possible to take PJA’s construction and add it to a better source because from what I’ve read it’s buggy, but comes down to peoples own opinions. I have multiple different downloads to choose from but I’d like to know more before I move onto higher revisions.</description>

<p>Thank you for the reply. Is there a base he’s created that you’d suggest me start with or is any good? And maps and pretty much whats displayed on the mini-map correct? I just want it to include hunter icons, Poh icons etc from that time period.</p>
<p>Also the only reason I said anything about ripping content is because the construction on PJA looked like a good started, it wasn’t perfected or completed from what I saw and thought it’d be good to add onto when I’m more familiar with coding.</p>
<p>Also while I’m thinking about it, is it possible to have something like PJA downloaded and use the moparscape client to look around see whats buggy? I was unsure how all that worked for offline use.</p>
