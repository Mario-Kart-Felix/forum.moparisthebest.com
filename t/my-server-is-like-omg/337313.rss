    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-server-is-like-omg/337313</link>
    <description>Yeah so basically, first post, im making a new server. Im using silabsoft client and logging in with my IP address (working fine). So my server is like awesome, and i asked my friend to go on it. He says that &quot;error connecting to server&quot;. So i read up on guides to port forward, which i did. After, still didnt work for him. I got no-IP and tried again. Thing is, i cant log in with my No-ip address (myname).no-ip.org, but only my IP address, HELP

my friend cant log in with my no-ip either, and i checked the box next to my no-ip to allow others to come to my server

ya im new so i kinda suck ROFL</description>

              <p>This can be one of a few reasons.</p>
<p>When you portforwarded, you might of put the ip that you connect to your router settings with.<br>
For example, if you connect to portforward by going to 192.168.0.1 (I Do) And When You Port Forward, It Shouldn’t Be The Same, as this is your gateway and not your LAN IP. To find you LAN IP, You Simply Go To The toolbar On Windows, Right Click The Wireless Network Connection, Click Onto Status, Click Support And It Says: IP Address: 192.168.xx.xx This is the IP You Put Into Port Forward.</p>

              <p>for you to login usually you have to have the ip of 127.0.0.1 in the client. and for other people to connect its the no-ip ip you made. 127.0.0.1 is local connection which only works for you. you need that connection in a client. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
