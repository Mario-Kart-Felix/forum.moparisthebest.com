    <description>It&#39;s the 5th of August 1945, my name is Little Boy and I am on board Enola Gay. You are my pilot, and for the purpose of this debate, also the commander in chief, and the man with the magic &quot;Deploy the payload&quot; button.

One of the biggest decisions of history is upon you, morality has rarely known such a grayish area as this one. I have one simple question, would [b]you[/b] drop me?</description>

              <p>While I DO support the fact that we dropped the bomb, it is false to say that Japan would have never surrendered. While they are very fanatical, there navy was decimated by that point and their infrastructure was just crumbling, and even before we had dropped the bomb the Big Six of Japan were discussing treaty options with the Soviets so that they could withdrawal completely from the war with not TO many punishments.</p>

Yeah I would of without hesitation. Saved us millions of US Lives, Probably saved us an insane amount of money (the cost to gauge an invasion on Japan’s mainland) Not to mention the Japanese were relentless they wouldn’t have surrendered for anything.

</aside>
<p>The propaganda was bad, sure, but you have to remember that the allied forces thought of Japan the same way that Germany thought of Russians, that Japanese people were animals, less than human, “untermensch”. You know, the American mutilation and theft of Japanese body parts was so bad that it prompted punishment on taking such souvieners, and even after the war when reparations were made, up to 60% of Japanese corpses were missing skulls after some battles. Rape was also a big concern for the Japanese people, and to put it into perspective, around 1,000 Japanese people comitted suicide on those “suicide cliffs” as you mentioned, but there were 1,336 reported cases of rape <span class="bbcode-b">within 10 days</span> of the occupation of Kanagawa prefecture.</p>
<p>It’s war, warcrimes happened, and the Japanese people had respecting suicide ingrained deeply into their society. Sure, propaganda was bad, but to claim that Japanese people were throwing themselves off of cliffs, almost implying without a valid reason, is doing a disservice to how grim the war was on all sides.</p>

<p>The second one seems a bit excessive to me, but the goal of the bombs were to destroy the factories supplying/storing vehicles/aircraft to their navy. Since they were mostly just committing suicide with their planes they probably had tons</p>
