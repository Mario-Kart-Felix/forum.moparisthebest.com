    <description>Ok this is a tut for Standby-ing (cheating in a manner of manipulating your internet connection)

--------------------
Things you will need|
--------------------
1. Router
2. Xbox (der)
3. Host (in matchmade, after the lag after the timer passes 1, hold the back button. Whos ever name does not have a red X next to it means they are host)
4. Xbox Live (otherwise its pointless)
5. Xbox microphone plug-in thing(the thing to plug into your controller)

[center]--------------------[/center]
[center]-How To Steal Host-[/center]
[center]--------------------[/center]

To steal host you need the microphone plug-in thing.

1. When in matchmade wait till you get to step 3.
2. When the countdown begins get your fingers on the mic plug-in.
3. Right when the number turns from 2 to 1 unplug your mic.
4. Plug it in immidiatly when the lag after the 1 begins.
5. Hold BACK to see if you have host.

[center]-Standby-ing-[/center]
[center]--------------[/center]

To standby, keep your router very close to you.

[center][size=14pt]If you do not have a button on router called Standby[/size][/center]
1. When you wish to standby unplug your ETHERNET plug for 5 seconds.
2. When you go into blue screen plug it in again.
3. When you retern to game(if you are host) you will have 3 seconds to kill anyone. They are still in blue screen.


[center][size=14pt]If you do have that button[/size][/center]
1. Click the button, and go killing while they lag.
2. At blue screen click the button on again. (so you don&#39;t lag yourself out of the game)
3. Again, you have 3 seconds to kill more.



I recommend practicing host stealing in unranked mathes such as &quot;Team Training&quot;, and &quot;Rumble Training&quot;.

You can also do this if there is a bridger(somone who uses a PC program to Steal host 100% of the time) in your party.



[center][size=16pt]WARNING[/size][/center]
Standby-ing during matchmade can get you suspended from only playing MatchMade games on Halo2 only. And by suspended I mean, banned, but temporarily. You can be susended an infinite amount of times. This is a great way to get your levels up, and is easier than trying to Mod your Xbox.

[quotes]Q</p>
<p>How does the Bungie “Banhammer” actually work?<br>
A</p>
<p>Our banning tools are complex and secret but initially we spend time scouring gameplay data for indications that someone has cheated. Once we have adequate proof, our team reviews these players and then enters them into our “Banhammer” tool. Once a player is listed in our ban list, he or she will be unable to play Halo 2 matchmaking on Xbox Live.</p>
<p>In general, a first-time offense will result in a 7 day ban from matchmaking. If it’s a secondary offense or a serious issue, a PERMANENT ban will be issued. This means players will not be able to play any online matchmade games ever again.[/quote]<br>
Standbying = cheating = you lose</p>
