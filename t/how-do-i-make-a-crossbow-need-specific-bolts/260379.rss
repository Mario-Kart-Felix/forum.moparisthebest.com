              <p>Im gonna try to make this as simple as possible, i don’t know if it will work at all, if it doesn’t just delete it all after you are done.</p>
<p>In your client.java, try to find the spot where it has things like where codes for wearing items are, like you need 99 ranged to wear the ranged cape and what not, if you can’t find something like that, then i don’t know what to do, here what some of mine look like (these are for members only items)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> }
	       if (wearID == 6920 &amp;&amp; playerIsMember &lt; 1) {
		sendMessage("You need to be a member to equip this item!");
		GoFalse = true;
	    }</code></pre>
<p>Now after you’ve done that, log into your server and weild your crossbow.  Make a note of what Item ID it is then go into your character files.  Find your character file and where it says things like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">character-equip = 0	14138	1</code></pre>
<p>Find the one that has, instead of 14138, the ID of your weapon.  I have no clue what character equip number it is and im too lazy to figure it out.</p>
<p>Now back into your client.java.  Go back to the part with the weilding codes and put something like this (realize i don’t know if this will work.)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> }
if (wearID == (ID of any other crossbow bolt besides dragon) &amp;&amp; character-equip = 0 = (ID of dragon crossbow){
sendMessage("You cannot wield these bolts with a dragon crossbow!");
GoFalse = true;
	    }</code></pre>
<p>Remember to change that character-equip = 0 to the one that is the weapon slot which you should figure out.</p>
<p>NOTE:  Wow that took awhile to type</p>
<p>Let me know if this works or if it totally screws up your server so i know not to do it.</p>
<p>And I may go onto your server, if I do, my username will be Evin</p>
<p>And also, you might want to do the reverse if you can figure it out so players can’t wield the bolts then the bow</p>
