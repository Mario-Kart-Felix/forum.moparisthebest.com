    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-lots-of-help-here/515970</link>
    <description>Ok so say I bought a windows vps (not linux) and I connect it to my remote desktop and I transfer all of my rsps files over to it, does that mean that its all connected and my server is open for anyone to play or do I have to put the vps&#39;s ip into my client under 
&quot;server = (vps ip here)&quot;
Also do when I am on the remote desktop with all my rsps transferred do I need to run my source on there or is it already connected and do I need no-ip still?

and then jar the file and give out that download link?
or do I need to do something else I have missed out?

At this moment I am currently hosting my rsps off no-ip and such but I wanna be able to turn off my computer but still have players be able to join my server. So can you please tell me if I am right and that are those all the steps to connect my rsps to my vps and so that players can join my server.

P.S: I am also wondering how do I stop connecting to my vps so that I can go back to my original desktop?

Please answer the first question and if you know the second question then please answer that both, any help would be great! Sorry there is a lot but I just really need to know all this.

P.S.S: I didn&#39;t mean to post in tut section :/</description>

              <p>Yes when you close a session on RDP the current user doesn’t log out, iirc there is a time out but I believe by default it’s not set. As for your question about re-setting up everything on the vps, yes you have to but it won’t affect your computer.</p>

              <p>Ok well then I have 1 more question. Say I am working on my source on my vps but I have to go do something important (off the computer) and I close out of my remote desktop and shut down my computer will everything I was just working on my vps still be open?</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: I am working on my source in my vps and I am also on a website, say youtube, (this is still all on my remote desktop still) but I have to go to work. So I close out of my remote desktop and I shut down my computer. A few hours later when I get back, I turn on my computer and login to my remote desktop will everything I was just working on still be open? Like would youtube still be open along with my source folder open?? (or whatever I was working on at the time)</p>

<p>1.Go onto your remote desktop<br>
2.download jdk (the newest version)<br>
3.download winrar<br>
4.download no-ip (and do whatever is needed for it)<br>
5.Transfer over my source and client (assuming that I have already put the no-ip into my client for players to join and that a download link is available to them)<br>
6.Make sure that on my router I have port forwarded (which I have without a vps atm)<br>
7.Go on the vps firewall and make sure that a port is open for the rsps<br>
8.check to see if players can get on<br>
9.let them enjoy the game</p>
<p>Did I miss anything or do something wrong?</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/host">@Host</a> Gushers, I didn’t do any of that to set up my server to port forward so how would this connect to my rsps so that people can join and play, and it doesn’t even tell me what to put in my “server =” to send out to people to join. This all may be stupid (what I am saying) but I just really wanna start hosting so that players can have a better experience.</p>
<p>EDIT: I looked it over a few more times and it is starting to make more sense but still please answer those questions I just asked. Also I am very grateful that you have tried to help me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>You must re-setup everything again, you will need Java to run the source. You will need to make sure you have the firewall set up correctly also, for the most part the ip you will use is the ip of the vps which should be static and not change, you can set up no-ip if you wish but you really have no real reason to.</p>
