    <title>Cleanest and Most Stable Source for Brand New Project?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cleanest-and-most-stable-source-for-brand-new-project/416126</link>
    <description>Okay, I know this sounds like I&#39;m asking for too much, but I&#39;ve searched for days and I can&#39;t find what I need.

I&#39;m looking for a VERY CLEAN Client and Source to start my new 317 project. I need something that is VERY clean meaning there is no bullshit, no extra stuff, very stable, only the things I need to start off with. I don&#39;t want anything that already has quests, and a load of pointless stuff already coded. I just want something that has the basics, and nothing more.

I&#39;ve searched the downloads section, and google for days. I&#39;ve been downloading and trying out different sources. I thought I found the perfect source and I cleaned the whole thing out (took aprox. 17 hours of nonstop work) and come to find out that the source is not stable at all.

Can anyone help me find the perfect clean 317 source and client to start off my project? I already have cache editors, map editors, etc. I&#39;m looking to start off a new type of server with better methods than what you see every day, I&#39;ve been studying java for years and I know plenty of things that could be improved that I see every day in server development.

Anyone who helps me find the perfect starting base(s) will be included in credits.

Thanks!</description>

<p>My server release was 2 clients, 1 that loads the 317 Cache, and one that loads a 377 Cache. My server loads both, I gave optional in-case there were problems with the 317 they could revert to the 377 cache, which I had to do very often, since I downgraded my server a lot.[/quote]</p>
<p>Love your work spades, I’m making a very nice server out of it right now. I’ll be sure to give you credits, BTW there is 2 config folders in your source? Which files can I remove?</p>

It’s not like anyone is gonna notice its a 377 cache if the sprites are 317. Also I was meaning the base source, you can use any client you want.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You said actual 317. No point in arguing, you don’t have a firm grasp on rsps to understand at the present time.[/quote]</p>
<p>It was never an argument until you turned it into one, and I’m pretty sure I have a firm grasp on rsps. And yes it does load 317 cache, if you look at the thread it clearly shows 2 different clients, one of them loading 317 cache, and the other loading a 377 cache. Besides this is my own thread, and everything was already solved before you got here. Also this is a help section, not argument wanted.</p>

<p>I’ve just found the perfect client and source for a brand new 317 project. Its very clean and stable, already has full tutorial coded, and its very nice. No extra shit like quests and that nonsense. If anyone needs the perfect base and client for a 317 server/project, use Spades-Scape. If you can’t find the thread or download, I’ll be glad to post links. THANKS!</p>

<p>Do you recommend any other clean and stable bases that are coded like the dodian base servers and not hyperion or project insanity? I’m not saying I want a dodian base, I just want something as stable as dodian, and very clean with no clutter, very light files.</p>

              <p>Okay, I know this sounds like I’m asking for too much, but I’ve searched for days and I can’t find what I need.</p>
<p>I’m looking for a VERY CLEAN Client and Source to start my new 317 project. I need something that is VERY clean meaning there is no bullshit, no extra stuff, very stable, only the things I need to start off with. I don’t want anything that already has quests, and a load of pointless stuff already coded. I just want something that has the basics, and nothing more.</p>
<p>I’ve searched the downloads section, and google for days. I’ve been downloading and trying out different sources. I thought I found the perfect source and I cleaned the whole thing out (took aprox. 17 hours of nonstop work) and come to find out that the source is not stable at all.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me find the perfect clean 317 source and client to start off my project? I already have cache editors, map editors, etc. I’m looking to start off a new type of server with better methods than what you see every day, I’ve been studying java for years and I know plenty of things that could be improved that I see every day in server development.</p>
<p>Anyone who helps me find the perfect starting base(s) will be included in credits.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
