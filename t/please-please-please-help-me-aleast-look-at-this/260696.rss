As I told you all earlyer today, this happens to every item that is possible to wear.

It is not any problem with item.java, but the problem is in client.java!

Someone, please help!! I have been trying to fix this all day, and if you got any questions about it, feel free to ask!!!!!!

Ill be happy and glad and everything for fast answers! 

Thanks!!!
