    <description>[center][size=18pt]Ok.. This is somthing little but just read.... Do not and i repeat do not go onto anything higher than 317 if you did not even master 317 yet. ive seen tons of people asking for help and half of them just started coding. Try 317 first and make a server. if you think its good and other people think its pretty good. Then host it.. Get a good amount of people on. The when you decide to start on a 474 and so on.[/size][/center</description>

              <p>Great advice, try perfecting the use of BBC codes before anything else.</p>
<p>As always, people can, and will do whatever they want.  While it is quite redundant to suggest starting with a 317 server before anything else no one will.  Sorry, but I see no reason for this to stay open.</p>
