    <description>Hello Moparscapians, I recently have returned to the RSPS community following I got bored of eveything else(I go in a cycle). Still supporting 317&#39;s as the best version, though I came up with some wacky ideas... What if I managed to implement some things from other popular MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft or maplestory? EG a Free Market(Maplestory), or Groups, Guilds and Instances(WoW).

Would you guys like that in a runescape server, and If not maybe there is something else you would like to see... POST IT!
Feedback would be nice please guys &lt;3

Peace, Stupid Ninja</description>
