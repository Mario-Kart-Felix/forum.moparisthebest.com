    <title>Romeo and Juliet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/romeo-and-juliet/2004</link>
    <description>Alright I am fed up with old english, but I have to do it since Im already failing english(Im not joking, it&#39;s an evil teacher, seriosuly). 

Well we have a test on Act 2 and 3 tomorrow, I still don&#39;t understand them. From what I can gather after reading them both twice, Romeo and Juliet have gotten married, Tybalt and Mercutio have a duel, mercutio dies so Romeo kills tybalt to avenge mercutio. And Juliet&#39;s parents still are unaware that she is married to romeo, and they are going to force her to marry some fag named Paris. Thats all I can figure out, but there must be much more that I am missing?

Could someone pinpoint some important information for me? My mark in english is a 45 right now(Not because I am stupid though). So, if you could perhaps tell me a few important things that happened in ACT 2 &amp; 3 then that would be awesome! 

Thanks!

[Dont read unless your interested]
Oh and if your wondering about my english mark, she seriously has something against me just because she and my mom got in an arguement one time. It started out because she gave me like a 50 something on a test, and my parents were looking at the test and she didn&#39;t mark an entire page so I was supposed to have a high 60 in the end. The teacher gladly changed my mark, but my mom took it far by yelling at her and started telling her she should lose her job, blah blah blah. Ever since then the teacher really hates me. She kicks me out of class like 2 or 3 times a week because I am sanitary and wear deoderant, she then tells the princapal that I am wearing perfume(which your not allowed) and I usually get in crap. No matter what deod I where or how much I put on she&#39;ll still do this, and of course the principal takes her side. She keeps the windows open in wintertime, and I sit right at the window and when I close it she kicks me out. It was fucking -30 degrees celcius, and she had the windows open, and it was during a test so I got a 0 after she kicked me out. At the end of  two weeks we hand in our homework and she makes sure it&#39;s done and stuff, TWICE she has claimed I never handed it in, even though I did. So as you can see she is a total bitch just because my mom got mad at her one time. Not really my fault. Anyways if you actually read all this, then could you please keep it on-topic about romeo and juliet?

<p>iruleeatants is a retard anyways,</p>
<p>But are you sure it’s not a simplified version? The reading in this is at the grade 10 level. Or maybe your teacher explains everything? Btw, this is like a month old I had my test a loong time ago, I dont think I need anymore help <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Now we’re reading some bullshit called lord of the flies.</p>

<p>if you fail that then</p>

<p>good luck[br][size=1]Posted at: April 28, 2006, 03:05:24 pm[/size][hr]and a hint aobut your teacher, when you do your homework scan it(maybe even get her to sign it) then she cant do that, also if deorant is allowed then bring it to school to show that your arnt wearing perfume, and simply get your mom to complain to the principal about the window(parents got the power since there tax payers, trust me on that i use my parents alot :P)</p>

<p>hope this help you...</p>

              <p>Basic synopsis is roughly the same as the myth of Pyramus and Thisbe, which it was based upon.  Alternatley, use West Side Story as a modern-day retelling (although I don't advise it).  <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>People fall in love, their romance is doomed because their families are in a feud.  There is a fight, and Romeo kills someone.  As a result he must leave the city, and so he and Juliet plan to run away together and elope.  Juliet talks to the helpful friar, who gives her a potion that will make her appear as one dead.  She takes the potion, and her family believes that she has died.  They bury her, and two messengers, one from the friar, one from Romeo's friends, are sent to him, both with different stories of what happened.  Guess who reaches him first?  (Yes, the messenger from his friends/Juliet's family, who says that Juliet died)  Romeo, devastated, goes to Juliet's tomb, lies down beside her, and drinks a vial of poison.  Juliet awakes shortly thereafter, sees Romeo dead beside her, and kills herself despairing with his sword/dagger.</p>
