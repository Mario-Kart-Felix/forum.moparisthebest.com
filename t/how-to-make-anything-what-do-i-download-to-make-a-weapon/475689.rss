              <p>yo, i would suggest using blender. you will have to export to 3ds, then open that with meta, then save it as a metaseq file, so it will be an extra 30 seconds each time you convert a model to .dat, but it was much easier for me to learn than meta. there are way more tutorials on it, and though it has more features it is no more complex to use than meta. start off by learning the basic shortcuts. then try and find a way to model something. if it is very low poly, say for a sword for an RSPS which will be maybe 300 vertices, then you can just manipulate the vertices, individually or as a group. if it is higher poly you will need to find another method. you can sometimes make a base that is low poly, just a basic structure, and then subdivide it, and start sculpting the details. i am rusty with blender, and i dont remember that much from it. there is a forum, blender artists, it is pretty good for learning blender.</p>
<p>i think many people here would suggest metaseq. that is perhpas a better option for an rsps item creator, but if you are really interested in 3d graphics i think blender is your best choice.</p>
<p>if you just want a cool sword, use meta. if you want to go advanced, use blender. (not to say metaseq is not advanced, i am sure that it is, but blender has more support and features)</p>
<p>good luck</p>

              <p>Well I’m assuming you didn’t check out <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363483.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this tutorial</a> as it has the Metasequoia download link a few scrolls down. That should help out a bit <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
