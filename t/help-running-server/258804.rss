    <title>Help running server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-running-server/258804</link>
    <description>I have posted this same thing 4 times, and haven&#39;t received one bit of help. I am looking for a Moderator&#39;s or Administrator&#39;s help.  I have No-Ip and Java 6 update 11.  I am using a wireless adapter to pick up my connection.  I can&#39;t remember what I did in the past to get my server up and online, but I know I never used port forward.  On my other computer (not aloud to run server&#39;s on it) I never used to have a router, but I have a modem.  So, I really need help from some of the staff. Please help me.</description>
