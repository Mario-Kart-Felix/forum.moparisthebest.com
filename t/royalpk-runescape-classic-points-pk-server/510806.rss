    <title>RoyalPK RuneScape Classic Points PK Server</title>

    <description>[b][size=12pt][font=georgia][url=http://www.royalpk.org]RoyalPK[/url] is a RuneScape Classic PK Private Server.[/font][/size][/b]
We have replicated &amp; customized the old famous private server called StorkPK founded by Stork.

We all know that there have been numerous of StorkPK replicas with different (modified) content released over the past years so why would we be any 
different and promising this time?

Well, we are because we have a very dedicated developing team aswell as serious &amp; mature administration team.

We are very close to our players to be sure they get what they want to have a great time on our server and we make sure people respect rules as well to have a fair ground for all our players.

We have been working very hard on the server stability and updates to be sure everything would work as intended.

Everyone starts with 96k sharks, 96k swordfish a iron 2-handed and 1000gp.
You will also be starting with 100 points which you can directly use at the point panel to get a faster start.

[b]Our max stat and current point rates are;[/b]
[code]
Max stat: 125 and combat level 156.
Normal user: 0.8x
Subscriber: 1.3x
Territory extra rate: 0.2x
[/code]

We took the opportunity to make a great clan interface to make it easier for our players to know whos in the clan, whos in charge and how many members are in the clan.
A clan can hold max 6 players. You can pass leader ship and give clan moderator promotion to other players in your clan if you are the clan leader.

As you can see, we also edited the territory (price of winning clanwars) to be sure players can find a good amount of npcs to train as a clan and added new npcs so people can enjoy various monsters to kill and good loots as well.

We have plenty of shops to make it comfortable for you to buy most of the PK supplys aswell as a Guide who can exchange your points into cash.

A quicker way for you to get to different training areas, pking areas and shop places use the Magical Pool or the teleport Lady.

              <p>Yet someone still manages to DDoS other servers… I say everyone should just jump ship and find a new server to play instead of trying to make RSCE the only one standing. If they have been trying to take down RSCE as well they should just stop period. They either need to get a REAL life and leave RSC alone or try to make their own server.</p>
<p>Also maybe if Jagex actually opened their RSC servers to the public these private servers probably wouldn’t be necessary!</p>

<p>There is no denying RSCE attacks their competition. With a reputation like that it’s no wonder others make servers just to avoid playing one ran by people who can’t handle competition without hacking. In fact if someone were to tell Jagex about RSCE I think something interesting might happen  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>RSCE attacks everyone so isn’t it time everyone attacked RSCE with a counterstrike?[/quote]<br>
Lol@ you thinkin jagex doesn’t know about rsce, it has been open for over 4+ years. They know about it…</p>
<p>The only reason this server is dying is the staff is never on, the ddos are minimal and never shut down the server, all it takes is 1 reset and its done.  The staff are always busy in real life. Never have time to host events, interact with community, or anything.</p>
