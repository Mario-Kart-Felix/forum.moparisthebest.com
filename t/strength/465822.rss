    <description>Is there anyway I can make ice barrage hit more? Because every time I use the spell it takes 10min to kill a rock crab with that spell and others as well. So how can I make it so instead of it splashing 20 times before I even hit the npc it will use the spell and not splash off?

I&#39;m not trying to be spoonfed as I have helped myself a lot. I have other posts asking for help and I got no help at all and I fixed it by myself after awhile but I would really like to get help with this, any help at all would be great.</description>

<p>I haven’t dealed with RSPS’s in a long time, but it should be somewhere server sided in client.java… There should be some numbers to change</p>
