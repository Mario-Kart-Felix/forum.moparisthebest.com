    <description>Basically I was writing some functions to do shit with a linked list in c but I failed with the delete part.
This is what I got so far:

[code=c]
int del(struct cock *root, int i) {
    if (i == 0) {
        struct cock *curr = root;
        curr = root-&gt;next;
        free(root);
        root = curr;
        
    } else {
        struct cock *curr = root;
        int j;
        for (j = 0; j &lt; i - 1; j++) {
            if (curr-&gt;next != NULL) {
                curr = curr-&gt;next;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        free(curr-&gt;next);
        curr-&gt;next = curr-&gt;next-&gt;next;

    }
    return 1;
}
[/code]

So basically ignore the else block of the method because that works perfectly.

It&#39;s the part that deletes the first node of the linked list that is borked. I assumed to delete the first item you simply change the root node to the 2nd item. I tried this but nothing happens. Could someone lead me to the correct direction.


edit, I just realised this is more to do with passing pointers to functions but oh well :p</description>
