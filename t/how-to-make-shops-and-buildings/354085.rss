    <title>How to make Shops and buildings</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-shops-and-buildings/354085</link>
    <description>Hello, I tried to make a shop and I don&#39;t know if I did anything right but I added a shop id thing and put the shop npc&#39;s out but then I trade them and it automatically loggs me out and back in, this happens every time. If anyone knows how to connect the shop with the npc&#39;s or what I&#39;m doing wrong could you please help.

And how do you make buildings and put the items in the building, like bank booth, pot plant, barrel etc.

Any help would be most appreciated. :confused: :confused:</description>

<p>And do you just log in without hosting a server?<br>
If so, You can’t edit anything due to the fact that your running a server that is built into that client.</p>

<p>Most run 317. I figured that you might have a different Protocol than I do, that’s why you dont’ even have the makeglobalObject method.</p>

<p>How can I get the same source as you, because I don’t have the “make global object” aswell and I want to make a Good server.</p>
<p>I do have a file called “shops.cfg” and it matches your example, the same stuff in it and I made one of those for my shop but I cant connect the shop with the shop keepers.</p>

              <p>You make shops by adding an npc to the “autospawn.cfg”, You need the coordinates of where you want to put it as well, Than you need to go to “shops.cfg” and add the npc wanneshop code, the item id, and the amount. As far as I know you can’t make a building, you need to have those as a preset for your cache. If you want to make items you need to go to your “client.java” in your source folder. Search for “makeglobalobject” and scroll down a bit and you should be able to make some objects there, you just need the ID and the coordinates.</p>
<p>Here’s some examples:</p>
<p>NPC:</p>
<p>spawn = 494	3096	3491	0	0	0	0	0	1	Banker</p>
<p>makeGlobalObject:</p>
<p>makeGlobalObject(3447, 3537, 4151, 0, 10); //Portal</p>
<p>Shop example:</p>
<p>shop = 2	Runes Store				2	2	556	100000	555	100000	557	100000	554	100000</p>
<p>for the shop you need to search for “wanneshop” in your client.java file in your source folder. Than find your npc you want to make a shop with.</p>
