    <title>NPC Clipping Client Sided[100% Clipping] Updated 6/15/10</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-clipping-client-sided-100-clipping-updated-6-15-10/344071</link>
    <description>This is a mass good-fight to many people.  People that use Worldmap.BIN files might be pissed after this.  I was mad after I dumped Object locations and created a method so npc&#39;s couldn&#39;t no-clip through objects(10 days of work).


I thought about this code a bit after starting my new server, The Renegade, and I actually made the code work.  The client has Map data, and Models packed into the cache.  Using the cache and parsing some of the incoming data(Object models) I was able to add clipping to the server.


The code took me 2 hours to make, and perfect(still am perfecting it for small bugs that you will see in the video).  



Enjoy the video, my voice may sound a bit shakey cause I am still surprised that this actually worked, also it&#39;s late at night and everyone is sleeping.



Like I just said, enjoy this video:

http://www.youtube.com/v/qWSbHR6xKwI



UPDATE


Added CustomObjects.JAVA


This file uses a code that reads the cache for updates on object models.  Now, you will be able to dump all objects(depending on client version) and make the clippable.



Lets say like with the tree in the video.  The lesser walked through it and got stuck...


Using a few arrays and a few INT&#39;s and implementing other classes, I was able to dump the cache into two files.


Fences/Gates(objects that you can shoot through)
Walls/Doors(Objects you can&#39;t shoot through...)


The code I made above works but it is server sided.  So, I am now working on developing a file to dump the files into arrays


like this:

&quot;22109&quot;,
&quot;23022&quot;,
&quot;29902&quot;,
&quot;3&quot;,
&quot;55&quot;,

ect.  Yes those are actual object ID&#39;s for fences/gates.  So, this is 100% but I am now working on a method to stop NPC&#39;s and players from shooting/attacking through objects.



UPDATE 2:

Finished the array&#39;s and added new definitions.


Check this video out to see what i mean, credits at end.

<p>Fences and gates are classified under the same object array.  If it isn’t a fence, they can’t attack through it.  Maybe add a soldier with a gun and allow him to snipe through windows?</p>

<p>I know what you mean, and like I said, I don’t have the NPC definitions file fully completed yet.  It renders most monsters as 1 square in size.  That is wrong, I will be fixing that and releasing this code.</p>

<p>like this:</p>
<p>“22109”,<br>
“23022”,<br>
“29902”,<br>
“3”,<br>
“55”,</p>
<p>ect.  Yes those are actual object ID’s for fences/gates.  So, this is 100% but I am now working on a method to stop NPC’s and players from shooting/attacking through objects.</p>
<p>UPDATE 2:</p>
<p>Finished the array’s and added new definitions.</p>
<p>Check this video out to see what i mean, credits at end.</p>
