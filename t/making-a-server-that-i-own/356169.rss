    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-server-that-i-own/356169</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having a problem making a server that i own. for some reason i have jdk but it doesnt work. can someone give me a tutorial on how to be the owner of a server so not everyone can spawn items? and so not everyone is a mod or admin? i would appreciate a good tutorial with a source included that will tell me exactly how to do all that please!!!  :)</description>

              <p>whatcha mean by jdk doesnt work?</p>
<p>if you get an error saying something like “cannot find jkd” when compiling or when you try to run your server. find which jdk version you have by going to c:// program files&gt; java, you should see your jdk version, at the end it should have a number for example, you might see something like this jdk1.1.6.0_17.</p>
<p>now go to your client and server files, right click on the run and compile bats and look for something that looks familiar to jdk1.1.6.0_17, then replace the end number (17) with the jdk version that you have.</p>
<p>also you can change player rights by going into your server files, characters, then editing a characters profile. inside you should see p.rights - 0 or something. changing the 0 will change there rights.</p>
<p>0 is normal player<br>
1 is player mod<br>
2 is admin<br>
3 is super admin, game maker</p>
<p>might be slightly different but mess about with it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
