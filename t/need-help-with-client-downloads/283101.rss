              <p>If Jacob’s solution doesn’t work, right click run.bat and select Edit. This will now open a notepad document and Im guessing it will look something like this…</p>
<p><code>@echo off
java -Xmx500m -cp .;Theme.jar Gui
</code></p>
<p>Now there are two ways to fix this.</p>
<p>Example 1.</p>
<p>Change it to this:</p>
<p><code>@echo off
start javaw -Xmx500m -cp .;Theme.jar Gui
exit</code></p>
<p>Example 2.</p>
<p>Open My Computer, or Computer for Vista and follow this.</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Java#Your JRE#\bin</p>
<p>Now inside this folder you will find a program called, Java.exe go ahead and copy this, (Right click, Copy)</p>
<p>Now paste it in with the rest of the client files. Now try run it again.</p>
<p>If either of these don’t work, Pm me and i will show you a third way.</p>

              <p>This is probably and most likely happening because you don’t have the Latest Java or you just don’t have Java installed on your computer at all.<br>
Go to <a href="http://Java.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Java.com</a> and Install Java, if this doesn’t work post feedback and please be more specific.</p>
