Mods and admins whine and complain about leechers and when people come along (yes, just like me) that attempt to make an honest effort, they get snubbed.  “We need more randomization!” Ha!  As if that will throw Jagex off.  Hyper-randomization is completely un-human-like.  You want the bot to be detectable, it has to act just like a human.  But noone cares to listen.<br>
[/quote]<br>
2 human actions can look like eachother but are never equal. Randomization is required to make it more human like.<br>
People don’t follow the same path twice etc. If a bot acts like a human it’s not detectable…[/quote]<br>
I mistyped my comment for this.  When I said detectable, I meant <span class="bbcode-b">UN</span>detectable.  Sorry.  You are absolutely right.  My comment was directed at the general impression I get that most people seem to think more and more randomization is better.  By that I mean more and more of the common antiban activities and more frequently.  How man people constantly spin and adjust the camera and switch repeatedly between tabs?  That’s what I’m referring to.  Path walking and mouse movement must absolutely have randomization applied to each and every operation.  I think we are in violent agreement on this one.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 19, 2009, 06:23:38 am[/size][hr][quote=“qauters, post:31, topic:268129”][quote author=zzSLeepzz link=topic=353909.msg2712168#msg2712168 date=1237397194]<br>

I respected the demands on Spel's time and Cowie</code>, completely disregarding my repeated attempts to contact him, completely ignores me.  Granted, I am nothing special, but I never got rude or nasty about it either.</p>
<p>But you know, after seeing all this transpiring and what I’ve experienced over the past few months since I’ve starting using RSBot and tried to become more than just a leecher, I’m beginning to think that maybe it’s best if I just fade away.  Stick to myself and do my own private thing, being grateful for what RSBot provides to build upon and just keep what I do to myself.</p>

<p>Granted, I agree that the advertisement was really unnecessary and over the top.  It’s kinda like .org’s “marketing” of VIP status and the supposed VIP scripts that you gain access to.  Those scripts aren’t really anything to write home about.  The best scripts are the ones that are simply advertised to all for a fee.</p>

<p>The real root of the problem is the java code that surrounds rs.jar.  It certainly can do with a great deal of improvement.  Improvements geared toward making script writing less of an exercise in the minute details of randomization, mouse movements and clicking.  Improvements to how randomization is done (flat distributions…give me a break).  Improvements in detecting the cursor moving over the menu hotspot in a target tile.  Improvements in continually varying mouse speed and reaction time rather than having a fixed one or one that is set only once when a script starts.</p>

<p>Mods and admins whine and complain about leechers and when people come along (yes, just like me) that attempt to make an honest effort, they get snubbed.  “We need more randomization!” Ha!

<p>2 human actions can look like eachother but are never equal. Randomization is required to make it more human like.<br>
People don’t follow the same path twice etc. If a bot acts like a human it’s not detectable…</p>

<p>To be honest, it doesn’t much matter to me.  I will continue with my own enhancements built on top of the RSBot base.  It wouldn’t be for sale but I would make it available to anyone who would want it.  I would not even bother with a website.  It would just “be”.</p>

</aside>
<p>Like I said before, I don’t agree with the marketing hype.  Peec’s bot is RSBot+, plain and simple.  What you call “additions” I call maintenance.  Peec’s bot is and should continue to be based completely on RSBot, in my opinion.  But if you look closely, you’ll notice things like my taking RSBot’s ideas for random number generation to the next level.  All consistent with my personal goal to make the bot’s external behaviors indistinguishable from that of a human while at the same time trying to eliminate some of the stickiest scripting problems through more intelligent bot methods.</p>
<p>As for quality, I will grant that my tenure in RSBot-land is all of about 4 months.  But I am not some 18 year old kid who learned Java on the internet either.  I would suggest though, that before you make judgments on the quality of my code (I can only speak for me right now because I’m the only one actively working on it), you might look at some of it first.

Being essentially shut out of (or more accurately, never given the chance of pitching in) the RSBot dev team, it’s just a fact of life.</p>
<p>You know what would be really ironic?  If RSBot actually picked up some of the enhancements that were introduced into PRSB…like automatically downloading rs.jar when its out of date, or the application of Gaussian random number distributions (instead of the current flat distribution…yuck), or the incorporation of automatically varying the mouse speed as part of normal mouse movement (rather than pushing that as a fixed setting up to the scripter).  There’s always hoping, but alas, pride and lust of power are difficult obstacles to overcome, especially for the younger among us.</p>
<p>But I do thank you for engaging in a conversation instead of lobbing useless puerile attacks.  Kudos.</p>

<h2><blockquote>18.March 2009</blockquote></h2>
<ul>
<li>.org Updates:<br>
+rev 122 to Script.java<br>
+rev 123 Delete WorldMapCloser.java.  Add CloseAllInterface.java</li>
</ul>
<h2>16/17.March 2009</h2>
<p>Many many updates incorporated from <a href="http://RSBot.org" rel="nofollow noopener">RSBot.org</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a bunch of new and as-yet untested mouse methods that support specifying<br>
the desired target action.  When the mouse handler encounters the action, it<br>
stops the mousemovement a few randomized increments after first encountering it.<br>
THESE <em>NEW</em> METHODS HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED.  Scripters use them at your own<br>
peril.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tweeked bank support so it works better with the new .org updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed non-working or retired random scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Picked up .or updates to BeehiveSolver, EvilTwin (replaces Molly), FreakyForester<br>
Maze, Pillory, Pinball, WelcomeScreen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>.org Updates</p>
<ul>
<li>Backed out .or rev118 updates because they did.</li>
<li>rev119 partial - rs.jar and RSLoader.java, bot will work again with update.</li>
<li>rev117 update to BotGUI for hiding log pane of game client.</li>
<li>rev118 updates to Script.java and ScriptHandler.java to fix the thread.stop() method</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank Class</p>
<ul>
<li>Added zzSleepzz’s open method to support numerous banker NPCs, booths<br>
and chests.  Use debug to provide IDs for new additions!  Post them in the<br>
forum.  A future enhancement will be to select the nearest NPC/booth in<br>
banks such as Varrock’s.</li>
<li>.org added many new banking hooks, so methods like Bank.getCount now work<br>
There is now a Bank.withdraw method too…trust me, it is very nice.</li>
<li>Added support for new bank interface and then picked up additional<br>
changes from .org, including Constants definitions in order to be compatible<br>
with .org’s bot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>InputHandler/MouseHandler<br>
++ Late fix for divide by zero exceptions that occur occasionally during<br>
mouse operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the InputHandler and MouseHandler classes so they vary the mouse<br>
speed with each operation.</li>
<li>Modifications to support deprecating the unnecessary mouse methods in<br>
the Methods class.</li>
<li>New random number generation, refer to Methods class info.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methods class</p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecated the more useless mouse methods, directing scripters to use<br>
the InputHandler instance directly (e.g. input.moveMouse(speed, x, y, rx, ry))</li>
<li>Change random number generation based on an idea from random number<br>
generation updates from .org.  We use a Guassian distribution instead of<br>
the standard flat distribution everyone else uses.</li>
<li>Changed the Methods.atNPC method to use Ruski’s method (with his permission)</li>
<li>Changed doWalk() to click on screen if target tile is on screen, otherwise<br>
click MM</li>
<li>Added resetWalkTilePathMM() method to allow scripters to reset the current<br>
variable used by walkTilePathMM when starting to walk a path.  This helps<br>
prevent hangs.</li>
<li>Fixed atMenu() so it will left click if the requested action is the first<br>
one in the menu (i.e. the default).  Enabled other related methods to<br>
accept a null action, which will perform a left-click on the target’s default<br>
action.</li>
<li>Simlified numerous methods now that atMenu() behaves in a sane and useful<br>
way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Randoms</p>
<ul>
<li>Added all random scripts from .org</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>GUI</p>
<ul>
<li>Picked up action bar restructuring from .org<br>
A lot of the “additions” have been taken from RSBot, so without access to their additions your project probably won’t be able to keep up. Even if your users stick to your bot, you probably won’t be able to match the quality.</li>
</ul>

              <p>Why don’t we get back to the real crux of the problem that led to all this foolishness?  Maybe we can do it without all the personal attacks?  Maybe?</p>
<p>Granted, I agree that the advertisement was really unnecessary and over the top.  It’s kinda like .org’s “marketing” of VIP status and the supposed VIP scripts that you gain access to.  Those scripts aren’t really anything to write home about.  The best scripts are the ones that are simply advertised to all for a fee.</p>
<p>The real root of the problem is the java code that surrounds rs.jar.  It certainly can do with a great deal of improvement.  Improvements geared toward making script writing less of an exercise in the minute details of randomization, mouse movements and clicking.  Improvements to how randomization is done (flat distributions…give me a break).  Improvements in detecting the cursor moving over the menu hotspot in a target tile.  Improvements in continually varying mouse speed and reaction time rather than having a fixed one or one that is set only once when a script starts.</p>
<p>Mods and admins whine and complain about leechers and when people come along (yes, just like me) that attempt to make an honest effort, they get snubbed.  “We need more randomization!” Ha!  As if that will throw Jagex off.  Hyper-randomization is completely un-human-like.  You want the bot to be detectable, it has to act just like a human.  But noone cares to listen.</p>
<p>Any effort that is going to improve on RSBot necessarily must be based on RSBot.  It is an excellent base to start from because it is an excellent bot…but not excellent enough.  But if the proprietors of the base aren’t interested in new contributors, what are we to do?  Sure, maintain our own private version.  But I want to share my particular efforts with others, and yes, even RSBot itself it they wanted.</p>
<p>All of this division and personal attacking is a waste of energy and really unnecessary.  It’s very unfortunate that it has come to this.  I for one, LOVE the challenge  of making a bot that Jagex can’t catch.  That’s my goal.  You guys want to have a pissing contest, have at it.</p>

Perhaps the reason why he has so much against the site is because they are advertising where they shouldn’t be, and are being annoying. Also, if he inserts the methods, his modified version belongs to him, and he legally has the right to rape you. Up the butt.<br>
I wonder what will happen to the site…</p>
