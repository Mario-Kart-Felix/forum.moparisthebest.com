    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-downloader/543880</link>
    <description>Alright. So I have the OverloadX Source and Client, As is the client runs off a cache in the client folder kind of like a 718.. But I changed the SIGNLINK directories and everything. Zipped cache correctly, uploaded to Dropbox put the public link into the Cachedownloader.java folder like you&#39;re supposed to, but it doesn&#39;t auto-dl the cache. It gives the cache folder, and only like 4 files just like it does when you don&#39;t do It correctly. If someone could help that would be greatly appreciated, Thanks
