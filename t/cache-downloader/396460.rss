    <title>Cache downloader</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-downloader/396460</link>
    <description>Well ive been reading java and stuff and i thought people like read it and then tried to do it hands on and tried to memorize the stuff started reading and i was thinking it was weird and was like wtf.... So then i asked the community what i should do. They told me what they did they said that i would on get experience if i progressed and did hands on and work on a project so i am. The first thing had to get a source, so ima use hybrid pvp(ik typical but its going be my first project i eventually plan to make a 2006 server when i learn more but be a while)well i want the cache to download by something i can monitor (by monitoring because atm where downloads the website can get removed or something so cache wont download). So ive found the cache download link which is 
[code]http://hybridpvp.net/cache.zip[/code]

it automatically downloads like no website pops up which ik is correct but i went to the website
[code]http://hybridpvp.net[/code]

i dont really understand on where he puts the cache download. People usually say dropbox so if someone can guide me the way what to do cause i want to learn,but not spoon feed to me.
