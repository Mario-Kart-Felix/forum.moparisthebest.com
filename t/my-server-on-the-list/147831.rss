    <description>I added my MortalScape.no-ip.info to the Hamachi list, because it was a Hamachi.

But I changed it to a regular server, and I wanted to delete it off the Hamachi list, but I forget my password.

Now I can&#39;t add my server to the regular list because it says that I already added it.

Please help or can someone delete it off the Hamachi list for me?</description>
