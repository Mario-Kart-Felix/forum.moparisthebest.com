    <title>Client uses so much ram!</title>

    <description>Oh my goodness, I posted this in server section! Can someone move!


lots of people get this error 
[img]http://i.imgur.com/tj5QhaD.png[/img]


So i looked it up and made xmx draw more memory, but that is not the fix. If some people are using 32bit java they still get the same problem they can&#39;t draw enough memory. People who are using 64bit java, and xmx draws 4k ram it works good for them

so what I need is my client needs to load better. it shouldn&#39;t be drawing that much memory in the first place. 
I have no idea how to go about this. I&#39;m looking for a point in the right direction. 
I think it has something to do with they way it loads maps and models.

There is the opportunity to receive sizable donation from me for helping me figure out the problem. I desperately need this fix. :)

add me on skype &quot;jdurky&quot; if you can help me out. :) or post here.</description>

<p>You’re most likely loading all the objects into ram hence the high memory (asssuming by the error) when in reality it should be ondemand I think.</p>

<p>I think you’re right.I just read my on demand fetcher</p>
<p><code>
	public void start(StreamLoader streamLoader, Client client1) {
		String as[] = { "model_version", "anim_version", "midi_version", "map_version" }; </code></p>
