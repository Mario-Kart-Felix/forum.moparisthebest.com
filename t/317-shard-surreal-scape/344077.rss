    <title>[317][Shard] Surreal Scape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-shard-surreal-scape/344077</link>
    <description>[center][IMG]http://i46.tinypic.com/2nk2zva.jpg[/img][/center]

[b]A little background:[/b]
Surreal Scape, is made by a few people who have endured both RS and RSPS for over 6 years. I myself, the Lead Developer, have been Admin/Global Moderator on many servers, the biggest, Frugooscape. I also have been in many communities around the internet and left a rather large footprint since the age of 10 and my birthday gift of a computer. I know how communities fail, and it&#39;s a pattern that&#39;s often repeated... well always repeated. Community is the most important part of a Server for me. So I&#39;ll work with people like Troy. Troy has a very similar past in communities to mine (do realize I&#39;ve trimed that in 1/1000th to keep the post short.) and as a Community manager, he&#39;ll keep things smooth.

We also have LunarKnight, a RSPS developer and player who also shares a similar path. He is great at client-side models, animations, and pretty much all around when needed. We all converged together about 3-4 years ago via Frugooscape. We&#39;ve seen so many crappy servers. So many poorly made servers with cheap tricks that make players love them.

But that isn&#39;t it. The main reason is we don&#39;t like how the games we love are run. Some of the best RSPS&#39;s have poorly run staff that is crooked and plays favourites. Well, they all do. The staff also can usually lay down oppression and abuse. I don&#39;t like how staff is given to friends either. Having our own server while emulating the fun, means we can eliminate this. We can stop the root of the problem, or a big part of it. Once we know our staff is good, we can focus on the Community members.

[b]Features:[/b]
Fast, Light-weight server based on Shard, so promises Stability.
Crash-patched.
Smooth Combat that isn&#39;t half-assed.
A very nice 317 Client.
Pickup Items. (Still deciding.)
Highscores.
vBulletin Community.
Domain name, no .tk, no free sites with pop-ups and spyware.
Skills done right without Shortcuts.
Staff that deserves the position as-well as excels at it.

About Pickup. I feel that if the skills are at a slower rate, say... x2 or x3, it makes up for allowing players to be able to spawn items. I think skills are more important than items, and as long as skills are a challenge (minus prayer) having spawning doesn&#39;t damage.

[b]Progress:[/b] 70% Done with Client. Fixing bugs, adding new designs, custom graphics for start screen, and models.
60% on PvNPC Combat need to work on Specials. Flawless calculations though.

[b]Media:[/b] None at the given moment.

[b]Team:[/b]

<p>And no, even for wL, Shard is not like Delta. Look at how much they can hold/ratio to ram etc. Shard is the best wL gets. So if not a framework, I figured at least use Shard.</p>

              <p>When you say poorly programmed servers you should add SHARD into that, SHARD is just as bad as a delta or czar server. It may be written better, cleaner, but SHARD is still a peace of shit compared to better higher performance scratch servers. I see what your saying still, wl servers are easier to program them most of the other scratch frameworks.</p>
<p>I will also point out that there is another crash patch that fixes the many problems with the Cryption class. One last suggestion is using a API like Netty or Mini to do your networking.</p>
