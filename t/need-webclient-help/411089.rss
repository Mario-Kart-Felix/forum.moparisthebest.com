    <description>317 - delta base

Okay so I&#39;ve never hosted a server before, only done so minor coding. Me and a few buddies have decided to buy a vps and a domain and get our own rsps up. The server is nearly complete, but I can&#39;t get the webclient up. I&#39;m seriously trying everything..

I follow ric&#39;s tutorial and I&#39;ve done everything correctly with no errors in the compiler. The client has been zipped and all that&#39;s left is for me to stream the cache.. Please tell me how I do this?</description>
