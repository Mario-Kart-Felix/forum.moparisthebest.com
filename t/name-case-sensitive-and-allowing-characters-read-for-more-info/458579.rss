    <title>Name Case Sensitive and Allowing Characters - Read for more info</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/name-case-sensitive-and-allowing-characters-read-for-more-info/458579</link>
    <description>My base is a project insanity and I would like to allow players to use the _ and - characters in their name as well as case sensitive names like Battlescape used to be (or still is I&#39;m not sure).

I&#39;m not requesting spoonfeeding but I at least need to be told where to look to allow this.</description>
