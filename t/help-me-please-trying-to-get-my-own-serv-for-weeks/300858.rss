    <title>HELP ME PLEASE. Trying to get my own serv for weeks :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-please-trying-to-get-my-own-serv-for-weeks/300858</link>
    <description>Ok i have a few brief questions first of all. I need the latest download link because after my client downloads the whole cache (v 3.2) it automatically closes im pretty sure i need a later version or there might be another solution. Anyways my 2nd question is can i use this to make my own server? Mopar seems good to do this because it has change IP, Port and such things like that and it looks easy to edit. My 3rd is an apology because some of these questions are probably posted somewhere else. but there are 4999 pages so... Yeah you get the point.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 07, 2009, 04:48:30 pm[/size][hr]bump...[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 07, 2009, 04:49:22 pm[/size][hr]bump..</description>
