    <title>Not here as much</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/not-here-as-much/5700</link>
    <description>

If you haven&#39;t noticed, I haven&#39;t been all too active like I was before.

Number of reasons. 

Jme&#39;s pretty much gone, he was my favorite kid on here =/

Not into RS as much. I wasn&#39;t before, but now I don&#39;t even wanna auto it.

Started a band, and that&#39;s occupying(sp) me lots.

I&#39;m in love. Yes I am. She&#39;s my life, and I plan to keep it that way.

The only forums I&#39;ve been recently checking is the music forum.

So if one day I just completely dissapear, here&#39;s goodbye and thanks in advance.

Mopar your forums taught me lots and this is the one site I&#39;d recommend to anyone.</description>

<p>I know what you mean. I have been away a lot too, even when I get a chance to come on I just don’t feel like it. Although I will be back in Setember. I have some similar reasons for being gone too, but mainly because Im working 8 hours a day, then staying at my cottage and partying more then ever before.</p>
