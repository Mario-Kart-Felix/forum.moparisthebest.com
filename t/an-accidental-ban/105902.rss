    <title>An Accidental Ban</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-accidental-ban/105902</link>
    <description>An IP ban have been issued to the owner of LeScape Pk and he told me on hamachi, it was definately not his fault. This is exactly what he said:

&quot;my friend was watching me code my server, and said he wanted to play too, I told him to register on the forums, got him set up showed him around on my account, then clicked register, said fill it out and went downstairs to eat my taco my sister brought from taco bell. I came back up and my friend (his name is ben) was laughing, saying he got IP banned. He registered from my account, I  did not do anything, can you please un do the ip ban&quot;

Please consider this attempt to recover his moparscape account(s).
Thank You</description>
