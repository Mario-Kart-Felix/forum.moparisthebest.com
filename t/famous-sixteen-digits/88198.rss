&lt;blockquote&gt;It&#39;s the most circulated number of the week. Sixteen hexadecimal digits that unlock the wonder of most currently released HD-DVD titles from the surly clutches of the AACS content protection system. Sixteen digits that have been posted in so many places -- and in many cases, removed only to be reposted -- that they&#39;re hard to avoid.

Cory Doctorow&#39;s class blog for his USC course, &quot;Pwned: How everyone on campus is a copyright criminal&quot; was served a DMCA takedown notice and, on the advice of counsel, removed the offending digits. They were posted to Wikipedia, then removed and locked from reposting. Then the diggstorm came. A slew of digg stories containing the forbidden digits have been posted, made the front page and been removed, only to start again.

Witness the modern equivalent of the 95 thesis&#39; Martin Luther nailed to the door of Wittenburg church. We, digital citizens --commonly referred to by the vulgar term of &#39;consumers&#39; -- have had enough of content lock-in. We&#39;ve bought and re-bought entertainment media -- repackaged and regurgitated digital vomitus -- until we&#39;re blue in the face. We&#39;ve been told time and time again that DRM is for our own protection, and we&#39;re finally and inconsolably fed up.
As Joe Rogan&#39;s character on Newsradio once quite accurately quipped, &quot;Dude, you can&#39;t take something off the Internet.. that&#39;s like trying to take pee out of a swimming pool.&quot; The content providers have attempted to do exactly that, remove pee from the proverbial swimming pool that is the Internet and, as we&#39;ve witnessed so many times before, they&#39;ve failed miserably.
The bottom line remains, we as consumers, want our content free (as in Freedom) and if we don&#39;t get it, we&#39;ll take our content free (as in beer).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

SPREAD IT EVERYWHERE YOU CAN, DON&#39;T LET THE MPAA WINZ!

              <p>Haha. Can someone tell me what they’ve been telling ‘consumers’ when it comes to DRM protecting them? How on earth is it a benefit for anyone other then the big companies? I’d like to hear/see their rationale.</p>

<blockquote>    09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0 is an HD-DVD decryption key that was leaked on April 30, 2007. The source of the leak is unclear. It is of interest to cryptographic researchers, as it can be used to play a protected HD-DVD movie in Linux, bypassing the normal DRM. The key will also allow for programs analagous to DeCSS for DVDs.
<pre><code>In a cease and desist order from the Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator addressed to Google Inc, the letter humorously included the code in question. [1]
