    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/random-3d-level-generation/365674</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently playing around with OpenGL in Java (lwjgl). It&#39;s fairly simple to use, and I&#39;ve got some objects with textures appearing on the screen as well as a first person camera.

The point I&#39;m currently having a little bit of bother at the moment is generating a random level. I would like to create something as advanced as the Minecraft level generator which uses Perlin noise.

I have an implementation of perlin noise, and I would like to get it to produce such lovely hills. At the moment I&#39;ve currently just got blocks in a random place on my level.

Can anyone help?

[size=1pt]I know none of you will even bother to help, but I can try.[/size]</description>

Do you have backface culling enabled?<br>

Cut him some slack, am I correct in assuming that you had no clue about 3D graphics until recently?</p>

<p>The problem I’m having now is the amount of blocks on the screen (3 chunks (a chunk is max 16x16x16, with blocks about the same size as Minecraft’s)) is causing massive slowdown. One chunk is fine, two is about playable, but three is just amazingly slow. I am aiming to have around 10 chunks on the screen at a time.</p>
<p>This is obviously due to me drawing each face in the cube, with four glTexCoord2f and for glVertex3f calls for each face. I would now like to know if there is any way of reducing this. (I have also tried to just not draw the blocks that are not on the screen which didn’t change the time at all).[/quote]</p>
<p>You should look at <a href="http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Buffer_Objects" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Buffer Objects</a>, instead of making numerous calls to glVertex and glTexCoord you upload the vertex and texture data to their appropriate buffers and render the buffers when needed.</p>

              <blockquote>11. Ahawks This may be "confidential" information, but I have to ask: As a developer, I am amazed at the amazing world that's created dynamically. Towering mountains, twisting caves opening up to caverns, islands, precious ores sprinkled throughout, etc. Notch, could you explain at a high level how the world generation algorithm does this?
I'm not sure how to explain it without getting technical.. The complicated high level technical version is: First I generate a linearly interpolated 3d perlin noise offset along the y axis. I fill that in so that everything except the top x blocks is stone, then I do a second pass to add features like grass, trees, gravel, sand, caves and flowers. The world is generated in chunks of 16x16x128 blocks, based of pseudorandom seeds that are a mix of the level base seed and the chunk location in the world. This ensures that you always get the same terrain in an area regardless of what direction you traveled there from.</blockquote>
