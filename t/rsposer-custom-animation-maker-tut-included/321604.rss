    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsposer-custom-animation-maker-tut-included/321604</link>
    <description>Hello, I am going to release RSPoser, it was not made by me,  [b]100% Credits to Mrpotatohead for the Program.[/b] But I haven&#39;t seen this on here, so I am going to post the Download, explain what it is, and how to use it!

         [b]1. What is it?[/b]
         RSPoser is a Custom Animation maker. You can make custom animations and add it to your Client to use! This is how the Dragon Claws Emote was made for 317&#39;s! This is how you can add Custom Emotes for ANYTHING!

          [b]2. Download[/b]
          The download is right here: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?zto3ydnn5tz]http://www.mediafire.com/?zto3ydnn5tz[/url]

          [b]3. How do I make emotes?[/b]

          Okay, so... You have downloaded the RSPoser. Now you know what it does and everything... but 1 problem... How do you use it. Well, I will be using Picture&#39;s to show you. Open the RSPoser.

Okay, so you have opened it up. It should look like this: [IMG]http://i46.tinypic.com/98bsrp.png[/img]


Then you need to go to File &gt; Load Model &gt; then click Model or Model2, Model is just a regular person. Model2 is The same person with a Cape and a ZGS. Now, After you load your Model, you have to open up an Animation. So go back into File &gt; Open Anim File &gt; Animation. After that you will be able to use the controls.

Ref - sets the reference point, that&#39;s the point where stuff is rotated, it is calculated from the center of the vertices with the skin values set in the skin list +/- X,Y,Z values (which you can set)
Scale - make parts bigger or smaller.
Alpha - sets transparency of the faces with face skins set in the skin list. 


The others (X, Y, Z) Either move it in that direction, rotate in that direction or something else. The numbers by the &#39;Main&#39; Controls are what you are moving rotating or what ever else, there will be a white dot where it is at. 

Also, adding Frames and stuff are just easy. Change the Frame Number up one, then Click Paste (after copying the last frame you made) and there is your last frame! Then you just continue the animation. And repeat that.
[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/ev1d9u.png[/img]

Coding it in...
[code]
int file = 1919;
int[] frames = {75, 75, 62, 62, 93, 93, 93, 82, 82, 82, 57, 57, 71, 71, 71, 66, 66, 66, 66, 61, 61, 92, 92, 92, 73, 73, 73, 65, 65, 65, 89, 89, 70, 70, 70, 81, 81, 81, 67, 67, 84, 84, 84, 59, 59, 59, 63, 63, 63, 99, 99, 99, 78, 78, 78, 69, 69, 69, 96, 96, 96, 96, 74, 74, 74, 74, 79, 79, 79, 90, 90, 90, 94, 94, 58};
aClass20Array351[j].anInt352 = frames.length-1;
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray353 = new int[frames.length-1];
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray354 = new int[frames.length-1];
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray355 = new int[frames.length-1];
for(int i2 = 0; i2 &lt; frames.length-1; i2++){
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray353[i2] = frames[i2]+FrameStart[file];
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray354[i2] = -1;
aClass20Array351[j].anIntArray355[i2] = 1;
}
}[/code]
Explaining the code: [code]if(j == 1){[/code] That is saying: If ::emote (or anim) is 1 then do this animation below.
[code]
int file = 1919;[/code] This is your Animation file. It is saying, load this file.

[code]
int[] frames = {75, 75, 62, 62, 93, 93, 93, 82, 82, 82, 57, 57, 71, 71, 71, 66, 66, 66, 66, 61, 61, 92, 92, 92, 73, 73, 73, 65, 65, 65, 89, 89, 70, 70, 70, 81, 81, 81, 67, 67, 84, 84, 84, 59, 59, 59, 63, 63, 63, 99, 99, 99, 78, 78, 78, 69, 69, 69, 96, 96, 96, 96, 74, 74, 74, 74, 79, 79, 79, 90, 90, 90, 94, 94, 58};[/code] That is saying, load these frames from the above file.

All the rest i do not understand. If anyone knows what the rest means then just put it up. 

After you are done with making your Animation, click File &gt; Save Anim File &gt; Name the file, then save.

After that, you have to add the code into the Class20.java i believe.</description>

int[] frames = {75, 75, 62, 62, 93, 93, 93, 82, 82, 82, 57, 57, 71, 71, 71, 66, 66, 66, 66, 61, 61, 92, 92, 92, 73, 73, 73, 65, 65, 65, 89, 89, 70, 70, 70, 81, 81, 81, 67, 67, 84, 84, 84, 59, 59, 59, 63, 63, 63, 99, 99, 99, 78, 78, 78, 69, 69, 69, 96, 96, 96, 96, 74, 74, 74, 74, 79, 79, 79, 90, 90, 90, 94, 94, 58};</code> That is saying, load these frames from the above file.</p>
<p>All the rest i do not understand. If anyone knows what the rest means then just put it up.</p>
<p>After you are done with making your Animation, click File &gt; Save Anim File &gt; Name the file, then save.</p>
<p>After that, you have to add the code into the Class20.java i believe.</p>
