    <description>I saw a thing on discovery channel about space elevators, it had a bunch of theories about how it would be possible, and a commercial i have saw recently said that the trip up would take 3 months, and made a good point. Wouldn&#39;t it suck to listen to elevator music for three months straight? What would be the point in wasting three months to go to space, when it is only going to be a space station. Thats a six month+ vacation, and think of all that could go wrong...

Well any thoughts? main reason for post: Bored, and can&#39;t figure out the answer to my homework so i will procrastinate lol...</description>

              <p>I was once watching something on the discovery channel on silk or something.  They said they were trying to find a way to mass produce black widow silk, because it was so strong, that it could even serve as light-weight armor.  It could also stop a bullet if it is folded over about 3 times.<br>
Then they were talking about how space developers wanted to make a giant sheet out of it, and then make it about 200,000 miles and about 100 feet wide/1cm thick.</p>
<p>I thought it was pretty crazy of an idea, but I think if it was possible it would be much more inexpensive, as the fuel and constant new technology of modern day space crafts are in the high millions per launch.</p>

              <p>yes, it was a strange material that took an hour or so to develop and like 12 hours to prove existed, some carbon string or something. Yea i figured it would probably be like a ship, which would be easy, but just imagine being trapped on an elevator for 3 months lol… Does any one see anything practical for this elevator? All i can think of is it may be cheaper to send people into space, i just think its a waste, they are probably spending more money to make them than it would cost for 100’s of times what a normal launch would cost.</p>
