    <title>Help with clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-clients/312810</link>
    <description>I&#39;m totally new to clients. i googled for help but no luck really with this. So i figured I&#39;d ask.

I want to download some clients and when I hit run, you know, the .bat file. it  says error, somethine in folder is missing. Any up to date clients that are not like that?

Also are there any clients like mopar scape 3.2 thar are up to date an let you do the ::pickup command?

Thanks</description>

              <p>There are many clients that work, it just depends what you want.<br>
If you want a old school style server, i suggest you search this site for a “317” server called<br>
“iclarity” it is very well done, and has old style graphics and old school pking.</p>
<p>If you want something that is similar to runescape, you would want a “508, 525, 554” server, either one of those 3 are basically up to date with most of runescape, just they are sorted differently which makes things harder to find and work with until your use to it. A decent server for this depends on what your looking for, many 525+ servers, which contain d claws, pvp armour etc, that look 100% like runescape are PVP only, because people have not developed and released NPC combat for these server’s yet. A decent 525 server, would be pur3z525, simply search for it. although it has  a anti-flooder, so you may need to find the tutorial on how to remove it.</p>
