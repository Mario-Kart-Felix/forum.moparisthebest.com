    <title>I had this fucked up dream</title>

    <description>And I thought I would share it with everyone.

[quote]These events will probably be a little less than what I had dreamt them to be since... yano, you start forgetting the dream the more you&#39;re not dreaming about them haha.
 
Anyhow,
Dream started out as being in a house I&#39;ve never been in or near, nothing I can quite remember.  
I think we were just moving in because I was bringing my cat there for what felt like the first time.
This dear/kangaroo thing (Mainly saw the face for the most part, and its neck was quite lanky and long)
started fuckin&#39; with my cat and biting it, etc.  For some reason the cat was just sitting around, but
whatever.  I ran over to this (From here on out, &quot;creature&quot;), and just started beating the shit out of it.
I could feel it biting me, but they were only nibbles.  It didn&#39;t seem like I did any damage to it yet,
from what it looked like.  I brought it into the house I was figuring out how to choke it (Apparently
in dreams, the neck isn&#39;t the first thing you look at).  Like I said, its neck was very skinny.  It
didn&#39;t even seem like it had bone in it (Just describing LoL).  It was like.. larger than a hose, but
the same concept LoL.  Eventually, it ended up with me putting both knees on its neck.  I was imagining
the look on its face, how it was scared, etc D:  It was gasping for air and all that jazz as well.
At one point, my mother and brother walk in and they hadn&#39;t noticed what I was doing, so it seemed.  
I didn&#39;t want them to, so I was like..  &quot;Keep walking.&quot; in a kinda semi-urgent way.  &quot;What?&quot;  
&quot;KEEP FUCKING WALKING!&quot;  Anyhow, I&#39;m still choking this thing; wouldn&#39;t die, wouldn&#39;t die, wouldn&#39;t die.  
I eventually ended up putting a palm on the back of its neck and then it&#39;s chin and twisting its head past
the point of looking back at me.  Again, I could see the fear in it&#39;s eyes D:  It was pretty much dead by this point.
It actually managed to twitch a little bit..  More like the leftover fight in it made it just.. shake midly.
There was orange stuff on the wall, instead of red blood D:  It was like the sauce in canned raviolis from
Shoprite.  Whatever..  Anyhow, I went and got two trash bags.  I stuffed it head first in the one, sealed it up,
then put the open end in the bottom of the other trash bag.
 
Then I woke up.[/quote][/quote]</description>

<p>[quote=“Thug-life”]the forum…</p>
<p>[quote]These events will probably be a little less than what I had dreamt them to be since… yano, you start forgetting the dream the more you’re not dreaming about them haha.</p>
<p>Anyhow,<br>
Dream started out as being in a house I’ve never been in or near, nothing I can quite remember.<br>
I think we were just moving in because I was bringing my cat there for what felt like the first time.<br>
This dear/kangaroo thing (Mainly saw the face for the most part, and its neck was quite lanky and long)<br>
started fuckin’ with my cat and biting it, etc.  For some reason the cat was just sitting around, but<br>
whatever.  I ran over to this (From here on out, “creature”), and just started beating the shit out of it.<br>
I could feel it biting me, but they were only nibbles.  It didn’t seem like I did any damage to it yet,<br>
from what it looked like.  I brought it into the house I was figuring out how to choke it (Apparently<br>
in dreams, the neck isn’t the first thing you look at).  Like I said, its neck was very skinny.  It<br>
didn’t even seem like it had bone in it (Just describing LoL).  It was like… larger than a hose, but<br>
the same concept LoL.  Eventually, it ended up with me putting both knees on its neck.  I was imagining<br>
the look on its face, how it was scared, etc D:  It was gasping for air and all that jazz as well.<br>
At one point, my mother and brother walk in and they hadn’t noticed what I was doing, so it seemed.<br>
I didn’t want them to, so I was like…  “Keep walking.” in a kinda semi-urgent way.  “What?”<br>
“KEEP FUCKING WALKING!”  Anyhow, I’m still choking this thing; wouldn’t die, wouldn’t die, wouldn’t die.<br>
I eventually ended up putting a palm on the back of its neck and then it’s chin and twisting its head past<br>
the point of looking back at me.  Again, I could see the fear in it’s eyes D:  It was pretty much dead by this point.<br>
It actually managed to twitch a little bit…  More like the leftover fight in it made it just… shake midly.<br>
There was orange stuff on the wall, instead of red blood D:  It was like the sauce in canned raviolis from<br>
Shoprite.  Whatever…  Anyhow, I went and got two trash bags.  I stuffed it head first in the one, sealed it up,<br>
then put the open end in the bottom of the other trash bag.</p>
<p>Then I woke up.[/quote][/quote]</p>
