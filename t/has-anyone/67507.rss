              <p>been locked outa my house twice,<br>
once came home and realised i hadnt got my key and my mum was picking other kids up from school lol so i noticed the window the right of my door was open a tiny bit so i pushed it so hard and it eventually opened and i crawled through.<br>
Second time was with my ex we went round to my back garden and i got a stick and poked it in my backdoor keyhole, the key was in the door and it fell out onto the mat inside, i put my hand in the cat flap and pulled the key towards me with the rug. badam.</p>
