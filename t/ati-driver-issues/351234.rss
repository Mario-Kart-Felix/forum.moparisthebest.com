    <title>ATI driver issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ati-driver-issues/351234</link>
    <description>So in my uni ill be working with CentOS and some bash stuff soon, so i decided to use some linux. I downloaded Kubuntu and said to my self, ill force my self to use it as long as i can get the video drivers and sound working. I don&#39;t play many games these days and the ones i do (WoW, portal, css, tf2) all work on linux as far as i know. So i installed it, messed around and googled for an hour how the fuck to install radeon 4650 mobility drivers, i finally got it to install, however i feel they didn&#39;t install properly. then more googling and i get confused with all this xfce shit bla bla. My sound also does not work out of the box.

help would be nice thx, newbie steps how to successfully set up ati drivers (and even sound codecs) i noticed kubuntu does not have that sypatec package manager that ubuntu has either?</description>

              <p>On kubuntu kpackagekit is your package manager (instead of synaptic).</p>
<p>Also, a program called jockey takes care of all your proprietary drivers, though if you already tried to install them another way, it might not work.</p>
