    <title>Need A Coder!</title>

    <description>I&#39;m looking for a good coder because I&#39;ve posted about this alot and no one will respond, and I KNOW this can work with the client, because it works in real Runescape. All I need is to make the player move FROM THE SERVER. (adding a point to the walking queue or something like that). This would make following work! And I already got the X and Y cord finding done, I just need a way to make the player walk there!  :eek:

Everyone is viewing and not responding  :(</description>

<p>And just out of curiosity, how does the server tell the client that the player is moving? Because when theres lag, you stop moving then start again, so the server must somehow already be telling the client that the player is moving. Can you use the code for when a walking packet is received?</p>
<p>There has to be a way if real RS can do it.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I can be done. I has been done. I’m trying to think what wource has it, I’e seen it before. Otherwise I don’t know how to make it work. I could make it loop, which makes it walk each square at a time, but there would be major bugs in it. Your best bet would be finding the source that has it.</p>
<p>PS. By source I mean a real one, such as P16 Blitz, Cheez 80, Whitescape etc. Not the stupid shit like Pimpscape and testscape, tyhey aren’t sources, they are sucks.[br][size=1]Posted on: May 25, 2007, 04:43:34 PM[/size][hr]Actually, coime to think of it, I do remember what it is. It is in most servers.</p>
<p>Search for “skillx” and “skilly”. It is around your object loading and npc talking etc.</p>
