    <description>Well I recently had a server my friend was hosting, did very well we had about 3 days with 120 peps playing, but he left and I have some issues with setting environmental, so I would really appreciate if someone could help me, contact me on my msn:

and if you can host a server even better (I am not asking for a hoster I am just commenting it)

and rewards will be given

              <p>[quote=“Thug-life, post:1, topic:219388”]Seems the rules were never put back so i’ll attempt to restore them, if anyone finds the old ones - feel free to move them back and delete this.</p>

So realize this, don’t bother posting in this section with any stupid undetailed questions . They will be locked without warning.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">2)</span> We will not help with computer problems, ie: portforwarding, how to set up java and such. Use <a href="http://google.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">google</a> or our <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,51.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Tutorial Section.</a><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">3)</span> No development <span class="bbcode-b">teams</span>, however, showing off your recent development in runescape servers is accepted. We can make exceptions to the no development teams rule, pm a member of staff first.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">4)</span> No server or website advertisement in <span class="bbcode-b">any</span> topics of this section. You will be muted or banned.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">5)</span> Off-topic posts - It seems this section is basically used for a general discussion for you lot, I know this site is lacking boards but we are fighting to try get some changes.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">6)</span> Topic titles, use a brief descriptive title, a title such as “NEEEEED HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP FAST!!!” is just annoying and won’t really help you get the help you need any faster.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">7)</span> Asking for a hoster is strictly forbidden.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">8)</span> When replying to a topic <span class="bbcode-b">DO NOT</span> respond with one word answers, or lines like “nice job 1 first post”. You will receive punishments</p>
<p>Users: If you see someone who is breaking one of the above rules, use the “Report to moderator” button under their post, and we will be notified. It may take a little time before it is solved.</p>
<p>Moderators: feel free to contact me on irc if theres anything you need to say.<br>
I’ll leave this open for suggestions and your opinions on the rules, just stay on topic. <span class="bbcode-b">I don’t need any ‘Thanks great rule’ type posts, you will be warned for posting such things and your post will be deleted.</span>[/quote]</p>
