    <description>OK! Thanks to Haxor X, I got into my wireless router.. Now, I encountered another problem. Now that I am into my router, I can&#39;t figure out what to do.. I have Netgear, and the model is WGT624. Well, I&#39;m in the router, and I have no idea how to port forward in my router to allow people into my server.  Help is always appreciated, thanks guys!</description>
