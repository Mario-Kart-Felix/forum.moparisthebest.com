    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/basic-pi-command-knowledge-pi-basic/401939</link>
    <description>Well im sick and tired of seeing people begging for command help in the server help section. I know this wont get rid of them, but hopefully reduce the amount by alittle bit.

I was gonna make this a big tutorial on PI commands, but i decided that im gonna make a basic and advanced tutorial, so people can be more accurate with what there looking for.

Difficulty - 2/10

[u][b]1. Basic Command Platforms[/b][/u]

There are many command platforms that make the command come together, im going too show you all of them, them how to customize them too your liking, to build your command

Command Base
[code]			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;YOURCOMMANDHERE&quot;)) {[/code]

This is how all commands will start, It is declaring what you will type after ::

There are also different things you can do to make it so certain people can do these commands. Like this..

[code]            if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;YOURCOMMANDHERE&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights -- PRIGHTSHERE)       {[/code]

Also there are things you can edit so that you can make it so that right, and anything above/under it, anyone but people with that right, or just people with that right can do it. You must replace the -- with the things below to activate what they explain

== - Only that right can use this command
&gt;= - Anyone with that right and above can use this command
&lt;= Anyone with that right and under can use this command

Player rights..
0 - Player
1 - Moderator
2 - Administrator
3 - Super Administrator/Owner
4 - Hidden admin (usually)

And if you want anybody too use the command, completely remove the &amp;&amp; c.playerRights statement.

More platforms are..

[code]            c.getItems().addItem(ITEMIDHERE, ITEMAMOUTHERE);[/code]

[code]                    c.sendMessage(&quot;YOURMESSAGEHERE&quot;);[/code]

Also after the end of the command be sure to add a } so it declares the command is over.

Finished Command

[code]            if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;YOURCOMMANDHERE&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights -- PRIGHTSHERE) {
            c.getItems().addItem(ITEMIDHERE, ITEMAMOUNTHERE);
            c.sendMessage(&quot;YOURMESSAGEHERE&quot;);
            }[/code]</description>

Can’t you just use a command gen  :D, But nice job. 6/10 Needs some work…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Erm. What work does it need?</p>
<p>Plus command generators are messy :s[/quote]<br>
If you make again make commands advanced like how to add gfxs to them ( not that hard ) but I mean like adding stats like master and say which one is which stat like 1 hp or w.e</p>

<p>Yeah but like i said this is basic, easy commands. Advanced is in progress</p>

              <p>Well, good tutorial so far. It will help a lot of beginning coders and maybe it will reduce the command questions in the server help section. Although some still will ask it there.
