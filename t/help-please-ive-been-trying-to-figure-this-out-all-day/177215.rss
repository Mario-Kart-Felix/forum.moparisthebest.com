    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-please-ive-been-trying-to-figure-this-out-all-day/177215</link>
    <description>Ok today i got a snow day..Almost the whole day off i was downloading all of the javas and jdk then trying to adjust the variables...because when i use the perfect complier 1.9 it says that i need jdk 5 or 6 or any updates for them i got all of them!!! Then i went to development/help and looked at tico135&#39;s thread...none of it worked!

My work:
I got all of the javas about 30 times (including all of the jdks...)
For the last time i just re-downloaded jdk 6.2.....
Now for the variables i put for CLASSPATH I put: CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_02\bin;%CLASSPATH%;
And then for PATH i put: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_02\bin

What am i doing wrong!!!!! Please oh please help! =(</description>
