    <description>I&#39;ve had this up at MSCP forever, guess I could post it here now.
[center][IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h430/tyb97/ZeroHourLogo.png[/img][/center]

Alright, so the basis of this server is going to be on a good economy, and the story that goes with it. All the pictures you are going to see are just what I have right now, they aren&#39;t even close to the final product. So don&#39;t judge on those. Please do judge the ideas I post on here though, that would be quiet helpful.

This is a little background image I made up, not much.
[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h430/tyb97/Client-Screen.png[/img]

Don&#39;t know how to use vB BBC, so here we go.

[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h430/tyb97/Clubs.png[/img]

Alright, so let me explain what a club is. A club is just like a guild, in other games, or the already existing clan, only variable is that these &quot;clubs&quot; are put on by the server, meaning you can join a number of the existing clubs, some have requirements, others are dependent on the player&#39;s interests. Since we (the owners) have control over the clubs, we are able to organize events for the clubs to participate in, such as &quot;skill-offs&quot;, or PvP tourneys, or minigames. Clubs as a whole can also organize un-offical events if they wish. The staff will also be watching over each club, looking for somebody that takes charge, and tries to guide the club correctly. If someone is recognized with these traits, he may be assigned a &quot;Club Administrator&quot;, in-game, and in his club. Reasons for giving him that rank in-game are so other Club Admin&#39;s can recognize each other, and organize events.

[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h430/tyb97/Gameframe.png[/img]

Just the current gameframe. A little preview I had for a skill in there ;)

[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h430/tyb97/Quests.png[/img]

I don&#39;t have any yet, only because they are going to be intertwined with the skills and such.               

Alright, so this is where my fun will start.

Some ideas that I have had might not happen, but it&#39;s worth the try.

Lets start with Prayer. The Prayer skill will be based on a choice you make in the beginning of your player&#39;s journey to becoming one of the most skilled survivalists, meaning, in the very beginning you must make a choice between &quot;Good &amp; Evil&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Zamorak &amp; Saradomin&quot;. Make this choice carefully, as it will impact you for the rest of your player&#39;s time in-game. When training the players skill, the opposite god may send minions and other such things to try and stop you, so you must always be ready.

With Thieving: While Thieving, if you are caught trying to steal, depending on the NPC, he may just hit you, try and kill you, or report you to the authorities. If you are reported, you will get a &quot;warrant&quot;, which allows players to capture you, and send you to jail. You may attack players that are trying to capture you, which also means he can retaliate. There are no combat level restrictions though, so skillers beware.

With Firemaking: As seen in the picture above, there is a item called &quot;Lighter Fluid&quot;, this may be used to raise the amount of XP earned while training this skill, but beware, just like Cooking, you can get burned. If your wearing a cloth material, that may also get turned to ash.

For Cooking: You can get burned while cooking on an open fire.


I&#39;ve completely ripped the base apart,  and am going to build it back up centered around my skills and such, and the right way. I&#39;m re-writing the way entities are handled, combat, using a container system for the inventory and bank, fixing all the stupid code left behind by others, and whatever else I can do to help.

Multiple things are loaded from mySQL databases, new player saving system (no more text files), re-written about 3/4 skills (Which have to be written again to match my ideas -_-), and some other small content additions.

A developer that goes by the name of &quot;Dragx55&quot; has also contributed quite a bit, he was with this project until one day he just disappeared. Jal Knight is the other owner on this project, he mostly handles the site stuff, which we are going to have a lot of integration with the site and server.

Anyways, wish me luck!</description>

Thanks, haven’t updated it in a while.<br>
Completely refactoring most of the base. I’m going to be centering the whole game around skills and combat, instead of those just being a past-time. I also want to re-write combat… Just haven’t gotten the time.<br>
[/quote]Nice is this based on hybrid pvp?[/quote]<br>
Unfortunately, but after I get done with what I’m working on, the only thing that will look the same will be the game-frame. I’m attempting to re-write everything in a more sensible way. It’s not ripped from it, but it will look like Hyperion in some ways, such as class names, and some objects and such.</p>
<p>EDIT: Re-vamped the thread.</p>

<p>Really nice argument you’ve presented, you know, with all these facts here before me. I can tell why you think that, I’ll just quit, because all the things that you’ve listed that are “shit” in my base are so true. Seriously, gtfo. You can’t even tell what the base is like from these pictures, I suggest you actually accomplish something in life, instead of sitting around on your probably 300lb ass, and do something. The only thing I have EVER seen from you, is a poorly explained advertisement, in the wrong section. Please, go to another forum, were the ignorant are loved, because you will have no friends from here.</p>

              <p>I’ve had this up at MSCP forever, guess I could post it here now.<br>
[center]<img src="http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h430/tyb97/ZeroHourLogo.png" alt width="320" height="320">[/center]</p>
<p>Alright, so the basis of this server is going to be on a good economy, and the story that goes with it. All the pictures you are going to see are just what I have right now, they aren’t even close to the final product. So don’t judge on those. Please do judge the ideas I post on here though, that would be quiet helpful.</p>
<p>This is a little background image I made up, not much.<br>
<img src="http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h430/tyb97/Client-Screen.png" alt width="320" height="320"></p>
<p>Don’t know how to use vB BBC, so here we go.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h430/tyb97/Clubs.png" alt width="320" height="320"></p>
<p>Alright, so let me explain what a club is. A club is just like a guild, in other games, or the already existing clan, only variable is that these “clubs” are put on by the server, meaning you can join a number of the existing clubs, some have requirements, others are dependent on the player’s interests. Since we (the owners) have control over the clubs, we are able to organize events for the clubs to participate in, such as “skill-offs”, or PvP tourneys, or minigames. Clubs as a whole can also organize un-offical events if they wish. The staff will also be watching over each club, looking for somebody that takes charge, and tries to guide the club correctly. If someone is recognized with these traits, he may be assigned a “Club Administrator”, in-game, and in his club. Reasons for giving him that rank in-game are so other Club Admin’s can recognize each other, and organize events.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h430/tyb97/Gameframe.png" alt width="320" height="320"></p>
<p>Just the current gameframe. A little preview I had for a skill in there <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p><img src="http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h430/tyb97/Quests.png" alt width="320" height="320"></p>
<p>I don’t have any yet, only because they are going to be intertwined with the skills and such.</p>
<p>Alright, so this is where my fun will start.</p>
<p>Some ideas that I have had might not happen, but it’s worth the try.</p>
<p>Lets start with Prayer. The Prayer skill will be based on a choice you make in the beginning of your player’s journey to becoming one of the most skilled survivalists, meaning, in the very beginning you must make a choice between “Good &amp; Evil” a.k.a. “Zamorak &amp; Saradomin”. Make this choice carefully, as it will impact you for the rest of your player’s time in-game. When training the players skill, the opposite god may send minions and other such things to try and stop you, so you must always be ready.</p>
<p>With Thieving: While Thieving, if you are caught trying to steal, depending on the NPC, he may just hit you, try and kill you, or report you to the authorities. If you are reported, you will get a “warrant”, which allows players to capture you, and send you to jail. You may attack players that are trying to capture you, which also means he can retaliate. There are no combat level restrictions though, so skillers beware.</p>
<p>With Firemaking: As seen in the picture above, there is a item called “Lighter Fluid”, this may be used to raise the amount of XP earned while training this skill, but beware, just like Cooking, you can get burned. If your wearing a cloth material, that may also get turned to ash.</p>
<p>For Cooking: You can get burned while cooking on an open fire.</p>
<p>I’ve completely ripped the base apart,  and am going to build it back up centered around my skills and such, and the right way. I’m re-writing the way entities are handled, combat, using a container system for the inventory and bank, fixing all the stupid code left behind by others, and whatever else I can do to help.</p>
<p>Multiple things are loaded from mySQL databases, new player saving system (no more text files), re-written about 3/4 skills (Which have to be written again to match my ideas -_-), and some other small content additions.</p>
<p>A developer that goes by the name of “Dragx55” has also contributed quite a bit, he was with this project until one day he just disappeared. Jal Knight is the other owner on this project, he mostly handles the site stuff, which we are going to have a lot of integration with the site and server.</p>
<p>Anyways, wish me luck!</p>
