<p>If a person doesn’t follow basic rules what makes you think that they will follow bigger rules, don’t defend a person when you just joined forum it doesn’t make you look good or them good, also if you have been here as long as you said you have then why should we show you respect you should know the rules and respect the rules, don’t follow rule breakers it shows that you have no respect for the mods and admins and the rules. One last thing no requests, and don’t say that you know the rules because if you did you wouldn’t break them.</p>
