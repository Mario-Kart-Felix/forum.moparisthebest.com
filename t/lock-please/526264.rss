Yes, I mentioned the name of the “God of Christianity” in my list above (at least, the name of the Christian God given in the Old Testament). So which one is it? I’d like to see how much you know about the topic.<br>

Who ever said I knew a lot about Christianity?<br>
I sure as hell didn’t.<br>
I didn’t grow up Christian.<br>
I’ve been to church maybe 5 times in my life.<br>
I really don’t know shit about my religion, I only started BELIEVING in God under a year ago.<br>
If you wanna get on my ass about it, fudge you, you can leave me alone too.<br>

<p>This is the Intellectual Discussions and Debates section. The adjective “intellectual” can be defined as: “A person possessing a highly developed intellect.” This generally means that you possess <span class="bbcode-b">some</span> knowledge about the topics that you are trying to discuss. Seeing as you specifically mentioned Christianity in the title, it is expected that you have enough knowledge about Christianity to discuss it. I’d also suggest you read the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,554411.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Section Rules</a> because at the moment you’re breaking some of them (as well as general forum rules).[/quote]</p>
<p>Theism:Christianity; Back to Originality<br>
My goal in this topic was to have people view the question the way it is rather than the way it has become.<br>
So, you can suck my dick. Hop off</p>

<p>First of all, considering that you don’t use words correctly nor make sense, i don’t think you should be calling Chillwitm888 illiterate.<br>
Sorry, i didn’t see the part where he was being hypocritical? Where did he say something that he didn’t practice?<br>
To say he, alone, is an argumentative person because of his statements is wrong. He was stating his opinion on the matter, and you being unable to accept anything disproving said against your religion, argued.<br>
When it comes to religion, nobody knows what they’re talking about because everything is different. There are too many renditions of religion to fully understand its meaning, and considering our social values have changed i don’t think we will ever know why.<br>
This forum was made for anyone to browse and contribute to, and considering this thread is on the forum, anyone can and will comment on your thread if they see fit. I don’t think you should be one to dictate who comments on not as you asked for peoples opinions, do not bash those who come forward. That is extremely hypocritical of you.<br>
Vanity isn’t something people cherish, stating that you are showing him up and will do so again and again when it is your own opinion is disgraceful. How do you expect a fair argument when you state that you are right and he is wrong because you believe your own opinion is the only correct one? That is extremely bias, there is no justice in your statements.</p>
<p>Your use of insulting words shows that your arguments are less valid then you think they seem, it expressed that you are informal to those who read it. I doubt those who read your argument think they are as well presented as you do. Maybe you should refrain from insulting others with pointless words and actually get on to proving your point.</p>
<p>You cannot believe both evolution and god’s creations as they contradict each other causing unstable beliefs. It is impossible to say god created evolution when we understand that our ancestors are of primate decedent, and yet god created humans as they are.</p>

I think without Christianity and other religions we would have 10x more crime, so its good that we have it, I just choose to not follow it.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>that is a horrible thing to assume.</p>
<p>just because people dont have a religion doesnt mean they dont have morals. I’ve never been to church(or any religious temple) in my life, and I’m not a religious person and I haven’t committed any crimes.[/quote] i never once said anything like that. i only said that true christians do little to no crime, opposed to idk anyone else. take the christianity out of people right now and see if crime rights dont more than double. and in saying that im not saying that non christians are responsible for more crime, but statistically, pretty much the truth</p>

CONCLUSION: You are an illiterate, hypocritical, argumentative person who DOES NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.<br>
You need to now, get the fudge off of my topic, do not post again, you’re not doing ANYONE ANY good by posting. If you do happen to post again<br>
because of your need to prove me wrong in everything I do (which by the way backfires on you), I shall show you up again, and again, and again, until you finally stop. BYE. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

First of all, considering that you don’t use words correctly nor make sense, i don’t think you should be calling Chillwitm888 illiterate.<br>
Sorry, i didn’t see the part where he was being hypocritical? Where did he say something that he didn’t practice?<br>
To say he, alone, is an argumentative person because of his statements is wrong. He was stating his opinion on the matter, and you being unable to accept anything disproving said against your religion, argued.<br>
When it comes to religion, nobody knows what they’re talking about because everything is different. There are too many renditions of religion to fully understand its meaning, and considering our social values have changed i don’t think we will ever know why.<br>
This forum was made for anyone to browse and contribute to, and considering this thread is on the forum, anyone can and will comment on your thread if they see fit. I don’t think you should be one to dictate who comments on not as you asked for peoples opinions, do not bash those who come forward. That is extremely hypocritical of you.<br>
Vanity isn’t something people cherish, stating that you are showing him up and will do so again and again when it is your own opinion is disgraceful. How do you expect a fair argument when you state that you are right and he is wrong because you believe your own opinion is the only correct one? That is extremely bias, there is no justice in your statements.</p>
<p>Your use of insulting words shows that your arguments are less valid then you think they seem, it expressed that you are informal to those who read it. I doubt those who read your argument think they are as well presented as you do. Maybe you should refrain from insulting others with pointless words and actually get on to proving your point.</p>
<p>You cannot believe both evolution and god’s creations as they contradict each other causing unstable beliefs. It is impossible to say god created evolution when we understand that our ancestors are of primate decedent, and yet god created humans as they are.[/quote]<br>
Yeah, I’m a bitch dude.</p>

<p>God of the bible says that all other gods are fakes. So you cannot say that all gods are the same. Norse faith tells us that we come from trees, God say we come from dust. Both can’t be true.</p>
