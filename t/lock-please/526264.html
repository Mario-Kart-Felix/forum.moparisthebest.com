        <blockquote>you DON'T have proof he does exist, but you DON'T have proof he doesn't</blockquote>
You can only prove something exists by sighting it, therefore it is an incorrect statement to say you can't prove he isn't real. It is like saying dragons exist, because you can't prove they don't. A ridiculous statement.
<p>God, in my opinion, though very popular, is just a story made up to help those cope with understanding and acceptance. A means in making those who are afraid of dying, happy, or for those who are scared and need to feel like someone is watching over them. The universe is such a complex space which we have little understanding of, it is just easier to make up rumours about someone who created it. When we don’t have answers, we want answers. At the time the easiest answer was to say someone controls everything, someone who is watching over us.</p>
<p>He also may have been made up for the simple purpose of controlling society as it began to build, an easier way to ensure people were in line. If you were ignorant and were threatened with being sent so a torturous place where you suffered for the rest of eternity, wouldn’t you want to do the right thing to ensure this didn’t happen to you? Surely, the majority who didn’t want that cursed upon their death would follow rules and they would be able to control society without many hassles.</p>
<p>See, the bible is filled with many contradictions. For example, if you sin you will go to hell, but god will forgive you for your sins and thus the reason Jesus died. This is what makes the bible hard to believe, all the extraordinary events that take place that just don’t happen every day. We best understand from experience, and when we are not shown this, we cannot believe it. Others, however, have a moment where they feel a need for protection or comfort and see something odd, this makes them believe.</p>
<p>You cannot judge someone on their faith or on their opinion on faith, it is insensitive and unnecessary as a means of action against the person or belief.</p>

The question of the matter is: do you believe beyond us?<br>
As a believer, I believe that there is something that made us. And that’s it really.<br>
Something that knows further than us. You don’t have to stop believing in evolution, because evolution doesn’t disprove it.<br>
Neither does ANY theory man can ever create.<br>
It’s a loophole and we’re the rabbits with big ears and bigger mouths.</p>

<p>You’re first contradiction: If you sin you go to hell, but God will forgive you for your sins.<br>
You missed out on the REASON God will forgive sins, believing in Jesus and accepting him as your savior.<br>
All the extraordinary events: Did NOT happen every day. The bible doesn’t tell you about the day Virgin Mary was bored all day and went to the market to get some fish does it? No, because, first off I just made that up, and second, it’s IRRELEVANT. It has nothing to do with why one should believe in Jesus or God, therefor, not going in the book of why you should believe in Jesus and God!<br>
We do understand from experience, however, have you ever had one of your friends tell you they saw a ghost or met a witch? If they have and you didn’t believe them, you’re like a big majority of modern-society, only believing what you see.<br>
Is it so hard to believe that we know nothing else about our world?<br>
Take this: I believe, in let’s just say 200 or so years (no one has any way of knowing), that technology will be so advanced, that we in these days would not even be able to survive. Like one of those movies where people go to the future and everybody’s stupid.<br>
And that HAS happened before, WE look at our ancestors and say they didn’t know SHIT about the world, DO WE NOT?<br>
Perhaps we’re ALL naive, but as we grow older we think we become less and less.<br>
Perhaps we’re all just some bitches that can only trust ourselves.</p>

That’s what this thread is about. Nobody views it that way anymore, society just goes with the flow and says nothing could exist because we have not seen it.<br>
Just what I was getting at about the theory of everything being made of the four elements, which by the way was accepted for over 2000 years, and now we have the CONCLUSION of ATOMS. NOBODY SAW THEM.</p>

        <p>I have been a Christian before only for a sense of having something to believe in<br>
As a young child I listened to the tapes of Mary and Jesus.<br>
It’s just false optimism that you can build up or you don’t. OH god will appear to those who believes in him. That’s pure ignorant of god to only reveal himself to those who have faith in him.<br>
Plus JESUS sacrificing his life to save us is just pure exaggeration. People have sacrificed lives for others for years. Yet some unknown wanderer who died on a cross, dies on his own accord because he tells people about his father being god… Is sacrificing his life for us?<br>
While philanthropists, and altruistic people sacrificing their lives and putting on the line such as soldiers and fire fighters. Wild life watchers, park rangers protecting animal life.<br>
It should be praised as much or more for actually saving kids and animals and human beings<br>
NOT some made up optimism. Bible is just full of contradictions and false written lies.<br>
EVen the first page “the world was formed in 7 days… Then there was humans”<br>
Daniel or David what ever his name was. Was thrown in a pit of lions because he believed in god and got saved by Angela cuz his faith in god. WELL it’s a bunch of bullshit. I know plenty of lives worth saving. The good people. The people who deserve worthy of spreading their influence died without people seeing their side of justice. Many were strong Christians. Robust believers. GOD didn’t help him. IT let them die. Let their corpses rot.<br>
Our world is entropy. Everything is meant to happen the way it should. Like a lake. God doesn’t exist in mines… Anymore. Although my reasons are more childish. I have my reason.<br>
Death,hate-relationships-crime. It was always there.<br>
Bundles of gases in space once in a orderly clump. Now the gases become planets and stars forming faster than ever. Forming out ward… Not orderly but entropy<br>
Entropy is the way the universe works and meant to happen<br>
ACc to math. Unless some alien comes down and says our math theory is all wrong and we have to recalculate our possibilities again which won’t I happen I hope <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
The universe that used to mean “it contains all” doesn’t really do what it says<br>
It’s more of a multiverse. God is a theory just like the multiverse.<br>
Until proof is shown, I will not accept it.<br>
HOW do u know Jesus exists?<br>
Has anyone seen his body? His skeleton? Idts<br>
Although I do believe we should not be ignorant to say we are the only live form with good intelligence. I do believe in superior beings, ones that may show itself to us. Only time will tell</p>

The bible says god created our world. This means every single thing we know, including the entire universe. The bible says when we die, we go into our eternity as we enter the spirit world (there may be another name for it, I’m not sure). Seeing as I, you, and Albert Einstein only know things of our world, I’m not to answer that question.<br>
Now to call out on your rude comment ‘what we ignorant people say’: First off, you’re calling me ignorant because of what I believe in, read the top of the thread, AND GET THE FUCK OFF OF MY THREAD. I TOLD YOU TO NOT DO THAT, AND I CAN SEE YOU DIDN’T EVEN REALIZE IT, HOWEVER, UNACCEPTABLE, GET THE FUCK OUT. Also, I think I answered your question a lot better than you would have imagined my ‘ignorant’ self to answer.</p>

</aside>
<p>It seems much more likely the other way around to me. In no records/experiments ever has it been that something came from nothing. However, we all have a very clear perception of time, and to our knowledge it will never end (to a Christian, it will never end in the physical world). This is just one example of something that never ends, but here’s another one: matter.<br>
Matter cannot be created nor destroyed, it changes shape and form constantly, but is always there.<br>
My previous example has that void of we can’t know if time will end or not, and this one appears to not, but I’ll give you one: we know nothing about something deleting matter, could it exist? I don’t believe so, I think it’s just fair I give you a little counter-argument.</p>

Has anyone seen his body? His skeleton? Idts<br>
Although I do believe we should not be ignorant to say we are the only live form with good intelligence. I do believe in superior beings, ones that may show itself to us. Only time will tell</p>

<p>That’s not a good way to communicate, I won’t even read through half of your shit because I feel insulted.<br>
I feel like you’re missing the point. The point is, atheists say God DOES NOT, CAN NOT, WOULD NOT, exist, but in reality you DO NOT KNOW.<br>
Believing in God is simply believing that we WERE CREATED. If we WERE CREATED, SOMETHING created us. Nothing means NOTHING. SOMETHING does NOT COME from NOTHING. THINGS COME FROM THINGS. NOTHING COMES FROM NOTHING. THIS IS SHIT WE ALREADY KNOW FROM EXPERIMENTS WE’VE DONE FOR HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF YEARS.</p>

<p>Where does god come from? Was he just there like all you contradicting ignorant people say?<br>

The bible says god created our world. This means every single thing we know, including the entire universe. The bible says when we die, we go into our eternity as we enter the spirit world (there may be another name for it, I’m not sure). Seeing as I, you, and Albert Einstein only know things of our world, I’m not to answer that question.<br>
Now to call out on your rude comment ‘what we ignorant people say’: First off, you’re calling me ignorant because of what I believe in, read the top of the thread, AND GET THE fudge OFF OF MY THREAD. I TOLD YOU TO NOT DO THAT, AND I CAN SEE YOU DIDN’T EVEN REALIZE IT, HOWEVER, UNACCEPTABLE, GET THE fudge OUT. Also, I think I answered your question a lot better than you would have imagined my ‘ignorant’ self to answer.</p>

</aside>
<p>It seems much more likely the other way around to me. In no records/experiments ever has it been that something came from nothing. However, we all have a very clear perception of time, and to our knowledge it will never end (to a Christian, it will never end in the physical world). This is just one example of something that never ends, but here’s another one: matter.<br>
Matter cannot be created nor destroyed, it changes shape and form constantly, but is always there.<br>
My previous example has that void of we can’t know if time will end or not, and this one appears to not, but I’ll give you one: we know nothing about something deleting matter, could it exist? I don’t believe so, I think it’s just fair I give you a little counter-argument.[/quote]<br>
If you can’t accept harsh debate or the fact that not everyone shares your view point… You should get the “fudge” out. So you are basing our entire existence solely on a book that’s written by Paul, Peter and a third member. Get this straight. The bible is not written by god.<br>
The sole reason we exist isn’t because of god. It’s a natural factor like (from a mothers womb, a egg, gass, particles;etc) Entropy is our existence. Chaos and peace.<br>
One is happy. One is sad. One is privileged. One is suffering. One is alive. One is dead. One is loved. One is hated.<br>
I think our life is like a movie script. It’s being played out spreading apart and breaking apart<br>
Through entropy. Our universe expanding is entropy. No longer a organized clump of gas<br>
I am didn’t mean to be rude. But I hate overused cliches used by Christians which doesn’t have Any scientific factor whatsoever.<br>
“He just existed”. That’s is the worst theory I’ve ever heard.<br>
“God is busy that’s why he isn’t answering our calls”<br>
“Jesus is white” “Jesus is black”</p>

<p>I have been a Christian before only for a sense of having something to believe in<br>
As a young child I listened to the tapes of Mary and Jesus.<br>
It’s just false optimism that you can build up or you don’t. OH god will appear to those who believes in him. That’s pure ignorant of god to only reveal himself to those who have faith in him.<br>
Plus JESUS sacrificing his life to save us is just pure exaggeration. People have sacrificed lives for others for years. Yet some unknown wanderer who died on a cross, dies on his own accord because he tells people about his father being god… Is sacrificing his life for us?<br>
While philanthropists, and altruistic people sacrificing their lives and putting on the line such as soldiers and fire fighters. Wild life watchers, park rangers protecting animal life.<br>
It should be praised as much or more for actually saving kids and animals and human beings<br>
NOT some made up optimism. Bible is just full of contradictions and false written lies.<br>
EVen the first page “the world was formed in 7 days… Then there was humans”<br>
Daniel or David what ever his name was. Was thrown in a pit of lions because he believed in god and got saved by Angela cuz his faith in god. WELL it’s a bunch of bullshit. I know plenty of lives worth saving. The good people. The people who deserve worthy of spreading their influence died without people seeing their side of justice. Many were strong Christians. Robust believers. GOD didn’t help him. IT let them die. Let their corpses rot.<br>
Our world is entropy. Everything is meant to happen the way it should. Like a lake. God doesn’t exist in mines… Anymore. Although my reasons are more childish. I have my reason.<br>
Death,hate-relationships-crime. It was always there.<br>
Bundles of gases in space once in a orderly clump. Now the gases become planets and stars forming faster than ever. Forming out ward… Not orderly but entropy<br>
Entropy is the way the universe works and meant to happen<br>
ACc to math. Unless some alien comes down and says our math theory is all wrong and we have to recalculate our possibilities again which won’t I happen I hope <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
The universe that used to mean “it contains all” doesn’t really do what it says<br>
It’s more of a multiverse. God is a theory just like the multiverse.<br>
Until proof is shown, I will not accept it.<br>

“Jesus is white” “Jesus is black”[/quote]<br>
I don’t base many beliefs off of the bible, I think the bible has been in the hands of people who should have not been writing it. I base my belief in God in what he has done for me, which I will not discuss with you. Also, I’m not upset at all because no one shares my point of view, if I would be upset over that I would have not made this thread, I got upset because I specifically said as the first thing I typed in this thread, DO NOT VIEW ME DIFFERENTLY FOR WHAT I BELIEVE IN, and I also gave a fair explaining as to why people shouldn’t, yet you’re stupid ass still comes along and does it anyway.<br>
You say the sole reason we exist is the natural factor like a mother’s womb, an egg, etc. THE QUESTION THAT’S CURRENTLY GOING ON IS WHAT CREATED THE MOTHER’S WOMB YOU DUMB fudge.<br>
I am didn’t mean to be rude. But I hate overused cliches used by Christians which doesn’t have Any scientific factor whatsoever. - I hardly consider myself a Christian, and please tell me which one I used.<br>
“He just existed”. That’s is the worst theory I’ve ever heard. -Not my theory, I said I won’t comment on his existence because it is out of our world (I cannot fathom it)<br>
“God is busy that’s why he isn’t answering our calls” -Who said that and why is it relevant?<br>
“Jesus is white” “Jesus is black” -Again?<br>
These ‘overused cliches’ (which I agree with for the most part, anyway) aren’t relevant, and I do not participate in them.</p>

Which one you used? You said because the bible said so ---- It sounds to me like you DESPISE Christians or any theists<br>
“The bible says god created our world. This means every single thing we know, including the entire universe. The bible says when we die, we go into our eternity as we enter the spirit world” — As I said “I dont base many of my beliefs on the bible” So this obviously must be one that I do<br>
See your ignorance is telling me you got proof that god created us — My ignorance is telling you I have proof that God created us? That makes no sense, you hypocritical bastard.<br>
I got all the proof to say we got created by a natural process… From a mothers womb<br>
Birth. — Which is true, but as I said multiple times now, We’re looking, asking, debating about WHAT CREATED THE MOTHER’S WOMB. WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THE MOTHERS FUCKING WOMB WE HAVE SINCE THE FIRST FUCKING WOMAN GAVE BIRTH, WE’RE OBVIOUSLY NOT ASKING/NEEDING THAT INFORMATION AS WE ALREADY HAVE IT</p>
<p>I never said it was your theory. You said it was the bibles a fudgeing contradicting book. - Again, you make you sense</p>
<p>2nd part - what Christian elders tell small children who ask. - Elder Christians do not tell small children that, are you retarded? DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT? NO!</p>
<p>Pray as you might. You won’t ever get a different result than when you haven’t      — I do see results in prayers, that’s WHY I BELIEVE.<br>
It’s just false optimism and luck that really tells — You’ve never tried to believe in God, and if you have, you haven’t HONESTLY ACTUALLY TRIED</p>
<p>3rd black people say Jesus is black — Some do some don’t what’s your point? BTW, I was saying ‘again’ referring to what I had just said ‘how is that relevant’<br>
White people portray Jesus white — some do, I used to PORTRAY him as white yes, but then I learned that it couldn’t be, now I portray him as middle-eastern<br>
Nobody has seen Jesus either. — That right there is a fucking stupid thing to say. It contradicts everything that we BOTH already know. We can both agree that you don’t have PROOF God exists, but in the same sense, YOU DON’T HAVE PROOF NOBODY SAY JESUS, SO WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU PUTTING YOUR STRONG OPINIONS INTO WHAT YOU WANT OTHERS TO PORTRAY AS FACTS.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: You are an illiterate, hypocritical, argumentative person who DOES NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.<br>
You need to now, get the fuck off of my topic, do not post again, you’re not doing ANYONE ANY good by posting. If you do happen to post again<br>
because of your need to prove me wrong in everything I do (which by the way backfires on you), I shall show you up again, and again, and again, until you finally stop. BYE. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

I can respect that. As a Christian, it’s my (duty, maybe not the right word) to invoke my religion onto others, but I feel wrong when I do so, so I try to use as much ease as possible, and as little push or force, explain why I personally believe, and try to help them find something in their life in which my religion would make sense to them.<br>
However, I feel I do it much differently. I’m a people person, I haven’t always been, years of runescape ruined all of my social skills, but I was forced into a life and somehow I got them back, stronger than I could have ever imagined, and stronger than I see in a lot of people. In a situation of me doing so, I feel as nothing more than just a single human being having a conversation with another human being.<br>
So, now it’s your turn, and you have a jumpier start seeing as this sentence seems. When I was finding God, I didn’t believe. I prayed out of respect for my dad when he told me “boy you better have some Jesus in your life”. I prayed on average maybe 3-4 nights a week for a few months, and 9/10 of my prayers were really sincere, I just told God, which again I had not yet known, what I wanted in my life, asked for help, and I said I’d play my part. This is still my base prayer routine by the way lol. A few months went by, and don’t ask me because I don’t remember why or what, but I remember I got a feeling when something happened, or maybe I realized something, and I said to myself there was no other way it wasn’t God. I’ve had the feeling multiple times now.<br>
Now every single time I don’t get that feeling, it’s nothing more than a test to me.<br>
I have a sense inside me that I’ll be alright in my life, and I feel almost singled out (by none, because I truly believe), and I feel kinda sorry for the people who don’t have my feelings.<br>
I also feel alone a lot.</p>
<p>Truth be said: I don’t even know how to say this, but I have a feeling, a hunch, a positivity that SOMETHING created us. I feel like I’m always being watched, but I can be myself at all times still, alone or accompanied, may it bring grief or not. I don’t know, I’m weird. But have the record known that I’m actually very bright. In my last year of elementary school (sixth grade for me) I made a 98%(I think) on my math state final. I mean, it’s math, but I’m also good at English, I could be good at History if I applied myself, and same with science, though I once was good at science.</p>
<p>The word science just jogged my memory of a question I ask people sometimes.<br>
Did it ever occur to you that Science is simply the study of how the Almighty Creator made everything we know?</p>

        <p>theology, science and philosophy up until around the time of the renaissance (during the middle ages basically) were actually intertwined and provided a general framework for understanding ‘God’s’ universe; the thing with science is that you have to be careful between pseudoscience and actual science which has a lot of solid evidence; one study does not prove that something exists and our knowledge of the external world is still limited by science in the sense that for it to be a scientific theory it has to be falsifiable (and, as is the case with much of physics it has been hopping from theory to theory)</p>
