        <p>God of the bible says that all other gods are fakes. So you cannot say that all gods are the same. Norse faith tells us that we come from trees, God say we come from dust. Both can’t be true.</p>

        <p>I though the bible was a story book (God being the super hero at the time and the devil being a nasty villain) and author was a guy named Christian from which the religion Christianity (name) was formed because years back.</p>
<p>I’m only joking ^^ (if anybody actually though that might of been a good idea…)</p>
<p>If you go back years back there were no law which meant the only way to control people and somewhat stop chaos was through religion. Thoughts and ideas got humans more interactive, allowing for our own creation, understandings allowing the creation of science. Our intelligence expanded (passed on) and here we are today. Look at the whole evolution topic, humans were all monkey people and wild hunters and comparing that with the changes over time is huge.</p>
<p>People believe they have spoken to God? Who know’s, did they even know about dreams back then? Did people question anybody? Are humans just gullible/learners?</p>

        <p>[quote=“PI_Developer, post:17, topic:526264”]CONCLUSION: You are an illiterate, hypocritical, argumentative person who DOES NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.<br>
You need to now, get the fudge off of my topic, do not post again, you’re not doing ANYONE ANY good by posting. If you do happen to post again<br>
because of your need to prove me wrong in everything I do (which by the way backfires on you), I shall show you up again, and again, and again, until you finally stop. BYE. :)[/quote]<br>
First of all, considering that you don’t use words correctly nor make sense, i don’t think you should be calling Chillwitm888 illiterate.<br>
Sorry, i didn’t see the part where he was being hypocritical? Where did he say something that he didn’t practice?<br>
To say he, alone, is an argumentative person because of his statements is wrong. He was stating his opinion on the matter, and you being unable to accept anything disproving said against your religion, argued.<br>
When it comes to religion, nobody knows what they’re talking about because everything is different. There are too many renditions of religion to fully understand its meaning, and considering our social values have changed i don’t think we will ever know why.<br>
This forum was made for anyone to browse and contribute to, and considering this thread is on the forum, anyone can and will comment on your thread if they see fit. I don’t think you should be one to dictate who comments on not as you asked for peoples opinions, do not bash those who come forward. That is extremely hypocritical of you.<br>
Vanity isn’t something people cherish, stating that you are showing him up and will do so again and again when it is your own opinion is disgraceful. How do you expect a fair argument when you state that you are right and he is wrong because you believe your own opinion is the only correct one? That is extremely bias, there is no justice in your statements.</p>
<p>Your use of insulting words shows that your arguments are less valid then you think they seem, it expressed that you are informal to those who read it. I doubt those who read your argument think they are as well presented as you do. Maybe you should refrain from insulting others with pointless words and actually get on to proving your point.</p>
<p>You cannot believe both evolution and god’s creations as they contradict each other causing unstable beliefs. It is impossible to say god created evolution when we understand that our ancestors are of primate decedent, and yet god created humans as they are.</p>

<p>that is a horrible thing to assume.</p>
<p>just because people dont have a religion doesnt mean they dont have morals. I’ve never been to church(or any religious temple) in my life, and I’m not a religious person and I haven’t committed any crimes.</p>

CONCLUSION: You are an illiterate, hypocritical, argumentative person who DOES NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.<br>
You need to now, get the fudge off of my topic, do not post again, you’re not doing ANYONE ANY good by posting. If you do happen to post again<br>
because of your need to prove me wrong in everything I do (which by the way backfires on you), I shall show you up again, and again, and again, until you finally stop. BYE. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

First of all, considering that you don’t use words correctly nor make sense, i don’t think you should be calling Chillwitm888 illiterate.<br>
Sorry, i didn’t see the part where he was being hypocritical? Where did he say something that he didn’t practice?<br>
To say he, alone, is an argumentative person because of his statements is wrong. He was stating his opinion on the matter, and you being unable to accept anything disproving said against your religion, argued.<br>
When it comes to religion, nobody knows what they’re talking about because everything is different. There are too many renditions of religion to fully understand its meaning, and considering our social values have changed i don’t think we will ever know why.<br>
This forum was made for anyone to browse and contribute to, and considering this thread is on the forum, anyone can and will comment on your thread if they see fit. I don’t think you should be one to dictate who comments on not as you asked for peoples opinions, do not bash those who come forward. That is extremely hypocritical of you.<br>
Vanity isn’t something people cherish, stating that you are showing him up and will do so again and again when it is your own opinion is disgraceful. How do you expect a fair argument when you state that you are right and he is wrong because you believe your own opinion is the only correct one? That is extremely bias, there is no justice in your statements.</p>
<p>Your use of insulting words shows that your arguments are less valid then you think they seem, it expressed that you are informal to those who read it. I doubt those who read your argument think they are as well presented as you do. Maybe you should refrain from insulting others with pointless words and actually get on to proving your point.</p>
<p>You cannot believe both evolution and god’s creations as they contradict each other causing unstable beliefs. It is impossible to say god created evolution when we understand that our ancestors are of primate decedent, and yet god created humans as they are.[/quote]<br>
Yeah, I’m a bitch dude.</p>

        <p>The problem with Christianity (and the reason people don’t like Christians) is that they have perverted what the religion is about. It’s not all about judgement and interfering with other peoples lives, it’s the opposite. Believing in a God should not be a reason for other people to hate you, it’s what Christians do with it that annoys everyone.</p>
<p>The main problem with people arguing FOR Christianity is the need to try and prove others wrong. You see someone point out a contradiction in the bible and the immediate reaction is to try and say “well, those actually mean two different things!”. Fact of the matter is those contradictions exist, and the reason is because of how the bible is written (many different people writing different sections).</p>
<p>tl;dr - Both Christians and people arguing against them look at the bible in the wrong way. It is a life story with one overall theme, you can live a greater, more fulfilling life (even if you don’t want to believe in heaven/hell) by loving other people, and nitpicking verses (for either side) is laughable.</p>

Put away anger, wrath, bitterness, and all evil speaking (Eph. 4:31; 1 Pet. 2:1).</p>
<p>There’s hardly any true Christians out there. You are not included.<br>
In your life I bet you’ve broken even more, this is just from a post<br>
Actually read and understand your religion before you keep spewing crap</p>

<p>You just quoted<br>
‘Put away anger, wrath, bitterness, and all evil speaking’<br>
Yet you try to make me mad (which worked) on the same post.<br>
How can you assume ANYTHING about my life?</p>
<p>Go.<br>
Straight.<br>
To.<br>
Hell.<br>
I wasn’t talking to you (anymore)<br>
I wasn’t talking about you (anymore)<br>
Leave me the fudge alone, stop assuming bullshit, stop trying to make me mad.<br>
Neither one of us can stop being hypocritical, so just go.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You can go to “hell”<br>
You aren’t even fit to be a true Christian how sad. If you are a true believer, the least you can do is follow rules. Too bad I don’t believe in hell either. You do.<br>
I’m not trying to make you mad, but since all you spewed at me was violent crap. I will do the same. I am free of religion and I am allowed to speak without breaking any rules.<br>

Leave me alone, will you?</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:35, topic:526264”]The problem with Christianity (and the reason people don’t like Christians) is that they have perverted what the religion is about. It’s not all about judgement and interfering with other peoples lives, it’s the opposite. Believing in a God should not be a reason for other people to hate you, it’s what Christians do with it that annoys everyone.</p>
<p>The main problem with people arguing FOR Christianity is the need to try and prove others wrong. You see someone point out a contradiction in the bible and the immediate reaction is to try and say “well, those actually mean two different things!”. Fact of the matter is those contradictions exist, and the reason is because of how the bible is written (many different people writing different sections).</p>
<p>tl;dr - Both Christians and people arguing against them look at the bible in the wrong way. It is a life story with one overall theme, you can live a greater, more fulfilling life (even if you don’t want to believe in heaven/hell) by loving other people, and nitpicking verses (for either side) is laughable.[/quote]<br>
Very non-mainstream of you. Agreed</p>

<p>First of all, considering that you don’t use words correctly nor make sense, i don’t think you should be calling Chillwitm888 illiterate.<br>
Sorry, i didn’t see the part where he was being hypocritical? Where did he say something that he didn’t practice?<br>
To say he, alone, is an argumentative person because of his statements is wrong. He was stating his opinion on the matter, and you being unable to accept anything disproving said against your religion, argued.<br>
When it comes to religion, nobody knows what they’re talking about because everything is different. There are too many renditions of religion to fully understand its meaning, and considering our social values have changed i don’t think we will ever know why.<br>
This forum was made for anyone to browse and contribute to, and considering this thread is on the forum, anyone can and will comment on your thread if they see fit. I don’t think you should be one to dictate who comments on not as you asked for peoples opinions, do not bash those who come forward. That is extremely hypocritical of you.<br>
Vanity isn’t something people cherish, stating that you are showing him up and will do so again and again when it is your own opinion is disgraceful. How do you expect a fair argument when you state that you are right and he is wrong because you believe your own opinion is the only correct one? That is extremely bias, there is no justice in your statements.</p>
<p>Your use of insulting words shows that your arguments are less valid then you think they seem, it expressed that you are informal to those who read it. I doubt those who read your argument think they are as well presented as you do. Maybe you should refrain from insulting others with pointless words and actually get on to proving your point.</p>
<p>You cannot believe both evolution and god’s creations as they contradict each other causing unstable beliefs. It is impossible to say god created evolution when we understand that our ancestors are of primate decedent, and yet god created humans as they are.<br>

        <p>I never agreed with the bible…</p>
<p>Until now! We must all follow these teachings.</p>
<p>“I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet”. -1 Timothy 2:12</p>
<p>“For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.” (I Corinthians 11:8-9)</p>
<p>Fact is there is a lot of stupid stuff in the bible written for older times. Times where they didn’t know jack shit about the natural world.  If you truly believe it is the word of god, than you can’t just pick the parts you like and ignore the others. Even out of context those verses are quite clear. It’s time to silence women once and for all.</p>
