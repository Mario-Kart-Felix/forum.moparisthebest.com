    <description>OK OK! i have found so many ip ban codes any methods but they do not work properly!

im looking for ::ipban commands that will ban the &quot;ip&quot; as well as there &quot;host&quot; so if they were to change there ip there host will still be banned.

also im looking for a code that will automatically ip ban players who spam.

and... :) i need something to make it so there can only be one connection per ip address! 

also if your aware of a firewall that will automatically detect more than one connection from 1 ip connecting to server that will be awesome!

atm i have kaspersky but it will not disable ips connecting through a java server.

i also have zonealarm which can ip ban ips but not automatically detect a flood.


to whom i get this help from i will give a awesome 80 + rs account with ever skill at least 20. str att df is all around 80</description>
