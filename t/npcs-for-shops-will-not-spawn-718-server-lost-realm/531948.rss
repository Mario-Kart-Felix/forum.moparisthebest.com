    <title>NPCs for shops will not spawn 718 server (Lost Realm)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npcs-for-shops-will-not-spawn-718-server-lost-realm/531948</link>
    <description>So far I have edited these files, NPCSpawn.java, unpackedshops.java, and mpchandler.java, and I have followed many tutorials. I can access my shop by typing &quot;::Shop 45&quot; in the server so I know I made the shop successfully, I just can&#39;t seem to get a NPC to spawn on this source called Lost Real 718. I also have compiled after each time and remembered to delete packedshops.s after each time. Can someone please help me? Thanks!</description>

              <p>if its npc that you’re trying to spawn i think its unpackednpcs.java? or something like taht and after you edit the unpacked files dont forget to deleted the packed file, also compiling the server doesn’t affect this, running it does.</p>

              <p>if you are having trouble spawning npcs my server has more then one npc spawn file on is named</p>
<p>NpcSpawns.java</p>
<p>and one is</p>
<p>NpcSpawning.java</p>
<p>whatever you are doing use the other one if you are having trouble getting the npc you selected to open shop this is the code replace the 2nd npcid with the id</p>
<p><code>else if (npc.getId() == Npcid)
ShopsHandler.openShop(player, 45);</code></p>
