    <title>Graphics card fails</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/graphics-card-fails/235977</link>
    <description>So, I have a Compaq Presario C500 laptop. I knew when I purchased it that it was not a gaming laptop atall, but I recently bought cod4 (PC) and suprise, suprise my graphics card is too suck ass to support it. 

So what am I looking at here? Is it possible to replace the intergrated graphics card that came with the laptop or just deal with the fact I can&#39;t play PC games?</description>

<p>I suggest you get a new comp any way because if you plan on running any game that has good graphics integrated wont get you any were.</p>
<p>And if you dont have use for the cod 4 then try to sell your key to someone.</p>

Bill Gates suddenly dies and finds himself face to face with God. God stood over Bill Gates and said, “Well Bill, I’m really confused on this one. It’s a tough decision; I’m not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95 among other indiscretions. I believe I’ll do something I’ve never done before; I’ll let you decide where you want to go.”</p>
<p>Bill pushed up his glasses, looked up at God and replied, “Could you briefly explain the difference between the two?” Looking slightly puzzled, God said, “Better yet, why don’t I let you visit both places briefly, then you can make your decision. Which do you choose to see first, Heaven or Hell?”</p>
<p>Bill played with his pocket protector for a moment, then looked back at God and said, “I think I’ll try Hell first.” So, with a flash of lightning and a cloud of smoke, Bill Gates went to Hell.</p>
<p>When he materialized in Hell, Bill looked around. It was a beautiful and clean place, a bit warm, with sandy beaches and tall mountains, clear skies, pristine water, and beautiful women frolicking about. A smile came across Bill’s face as he took in a deep breath of the clean air. “This is great,” he thought, “if this is Hell, I can’t wait to see heaven.”</p>
<p>Within seconds of his thought, another flash of lightning and a cloud of smoke appeared, and Bill was off to Heaven. Heaven was a place high above the clouds, where angels were drifting about playing their harps and singing in a beautiful chorus. It was a very nice place, Bill thought, but not as enticing as Hell.</p>
<p>Bill looked up, cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled for God and Bill Gates was sent to Hell for eternity.</p>
<p>Time passed, and God decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was progressing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill Gates shackled to a wall in a dark cave amid bone thin men and tongues of fire, being burned and tortured by demons.</p>
<p>“So, how is everything going?” God asked.</p>
<p>Bill responded with a crackling voice filled with anguish and disappointment, "This is awful! It’s nothing like the Hell I visited the first time!! I can’t believe this is happening! What happened to the other place…with the beaches and the mountains and the beautiful women?</p>
<p>“That was the demo,” replied God.[/quote]<br>
OWNT… That would be funny…</p>

My old Compaq Presario x1000 (from like 2004) had a removable Video card. But, i didn’t need to remove it, because it could run CSS at like 100fps on highest settings.</p>

              <p>You should be able to play cod on it, assuming that it has Intel GMA 950(looked it up), because you can play crysis, which takes shitload of more than cod on intel x310. I have a really unknown graphics card, SiS silicon or something like that and I havn’t had problems playing any games. Also, the laptop you bought is complete shit.</p>

              <p>So, I have a Compaq Presario C500 laptop. I knew when I purchased it that it was not a gaming laptop atall, but I recently bought cod4 (PC) and suprise, suprise my graphics card is too suck ass to support it.</p>
<p>So what am I looking at here? Is it possible to replace the intergrated graphics card that came with the laptop or just deal with the fact I can’t play PC games?</p>
