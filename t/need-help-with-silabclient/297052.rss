    <title>Need Help With SilabClient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-silabclient/297052</link>
    <description>Hello Moparscape.
I was wondering if anyone knows a client that will be fully editable for me, but still NO custom items and all the new silabsoft items.
If someone knows of a client like described please reply! :P thank you.</description>
