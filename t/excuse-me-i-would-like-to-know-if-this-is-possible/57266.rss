    <description>Hi its me again.
Today i have had this wierd idea that wouldnt it be cool if when say sombody closes a door on thier client it affects evry player on the server.
Just for a few things i meen i dont want to make it happen for the whole game THINK OF THE LAG. But it if worked Say so i made a lever ingame and then when this lever was pulled the Gates appeared on varrock and it sent a message to evrybody in the game Saying that varrock was in Prepairing for war or somthing That would be so Cool wouldnt it. I dont mind if there isnt one but i just want to know if its humanly possible Becease i know it does it on runescape with some things but not with others (Al kahrid doors in the guard place or  Gnome glider unfolding in Monkey madness.) But if it is possible i would love to do it for my server becuase Of the seriusly cool stuff that i could do that would make my server even more unique from others (Currently Loads of pvp events and Random game meetings are the only thing i can think of that makes us realy unique.) Anyway  Cmon it is probably somthing simple I meen i have a few ideas about how it could be done.A. Send somthing to all players online B.Unlikly but maybe Just using some setting to change it C. Force A  Single command through all players online when lever was pressed. But oh well all my ideas are utter Rubbish Just sombody please help me out here as this could be a very simple but significant thing to do
Ime not gohna bother doing somthing like offering admin on my server but If u help me out i will be permenantly In Debt Thank you
