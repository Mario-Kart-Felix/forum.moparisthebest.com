    <title>Choosing a Blank Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/choosing-a-blank-source/545924</link>
    <description>Hey all,

I see how I&#39;ve been recommended to start with Hyperion, rune-source, and apollo before. But, how do I start? I don&#39;t know how they work because everything is seperated into its own file. So, this makes me wonder if I should start with something simple like Allstarscape/Delta/PI just to get the hang of Java? I really don&#39;t know much because I don&#39;t know how to put code into action, etc. If Hyperion still is the best choice for me, could someone help me out and show me how things work?


Thanks

P.S: What is a RS2Protocol?</description>

no do not start with winterlove, just start with a master copy of runesource as its simple, clean, documented, and you’ll learn the basis of programming in java. you’ll also learn a bit about networking (I/O, ill explain what that means later).</p>
<p>read up on the actual java language <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. yes, read every section. no, do not ‘skim’ through it because if you are at a low programming level you’ll miss out on lots of helpful information (ESPECIALLY the ‘variables’ section because it highlights instance and class variables, which is extremely important to know). each section is like a 2 minute read, read one or two a day.</p>

<p>rs2 protocol = runescape 2 protocol</p>
<p>protocol: a set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.</p>
<p>so basically the protocol is the way that data is sent to and recieved from the client. one thing that you NEED to understand is the basis of how runescape servers function is by SENDING (output/writing)  data to and RECIEVING (input/reading) data from the client.</p>
<p>whenever you see people talking about “I(input)/O(output)” all they’re referring to is communication between the client and server. also note that a “packet” is data that’s being sent or received</p>
<p>another example is you might see these numbers a lot in the runescape servers part of the forums 317, 319, 377, 459, 474, 508, 525, etc. those are all different revisions and each of them have a different protocol (different packet structure, different way of doing things)</p>
<p>last example, god you better be reading all of this lol.</p>
<ul>
<li>when you pickup an item, the client sends a packet to the server</li>
<li>when you drop an item, the client sends a packet to the server</li>
<li>when you want to send a message to the player in the chatbox, the server sends a packet to the client</li>
<li>when you want to display an object, the server sends a packet to the client</li>
</ul>
<p>this will all start to make sense once you start playing around with the server, if you decide to use a good server that is. once you understand this you will already be ahead of most of the community. you are not going to become a programming genius after 1 or two months. this isn’t something you can just jump into (if you want to actually become good, fast). study the internals, learn how everything works and you should be fine bro! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>once again, don’t feel like you’re being annoying. any questions you have, post em here[/quote]<br>
lare96 for server help pls.</p>
<p>No really. If you could give that quality advice and help on other topics that’d be cool <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
