Critisism: i know you are new, but 3.5 hours is a long time. The bottom of the handle looks strange… the handle needs to be round… and thats it! Very very good job[/quote]Yeah it took 3.5 hours because I was trying to do it without the mirror function, eventually I figured it out and finished it quickly. The handle can’t be round because irl if the handle was round the axe would spin around in your hands <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Thanks for the criticism though.</p>
