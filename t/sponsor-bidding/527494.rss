    <title>Sponsor Bidding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sponsor-bidding/527494</link>
    <description>just a little question i have about bidding, i will not go into specific details as im sure mopar doesnt want me to display whats going on during the bids because its obviously set to private for a reason. anyways, all gratitude to tom for accepting my late application to bid for mopar sponsorship, but im quite confused on how bidding works. yesterday after being accepted, i bidded enough to get myself to the top10 of the &quot;current bids&quot; list, but it did not display my bid. i bidded before a guy and his bid showed up, just probably something wrong cuz i was added late. dont wanna miss out incase anything goes wrong on the tenth.

i do not see anything that allows me to bid.. all i see is a paypal button and i was just told this was not the button to bid, but a button to pay a $5 fee. i read this on the page that i would have to pay the non refundable $5 and then be able to bid, but after doing that, i saw no way to bid, so i just went ahead and thought that was the way to do it..

http://prntscr.com/1k3g3h

this is proof ive paid the fee and even more than that because i thought it was the way to bid.

<p>Thanks for the reply, kinda sucks as I still don’t see the box and I don’t really wanna pay another $5 fee because I’ve already sent in more than what was expected.</p>

<p>just a little question i have about bidding, i will not go into specific details as im sure mopar doesnt want me to display whats going on during the bids because its obviously set to private for a reason. anyways, all gratitude to tom for accepting my late application to bid for mopar sponsorship, but im quite confused on how bidding works. yesterday after being accepted, i bidded enough to get myself to the top10 of the “current bids” list, but it did not display my bid. i bidded before a guy and his bid showed up, just probably something wrong cuz i was added late. dont wanna miss out incase anything goes wrong on the tenth.</p>

<p>Again PM either Tom, Taharok or Moparisthebest. Stop making threads about the sponsor system because no one except them can do anything about it.</p>

<p>i do not see anything that allows me to bid… all i see is a paypal button and i was just told this was not the button to bid, but a button to pay a $5 fee. i read this on the page that i would have to pay the non refundable $5 and then be able to bid, but after doing that, i saw no way to bid, so i just went ahead and thought that was the way to do it…</p>
