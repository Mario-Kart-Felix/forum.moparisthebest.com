    <title>How to make server 24/7</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-server-24-7/398791</link>
    <description>Hey, is there any way you can get a 24/7 server hoster, so like...
It sets up the client and source and what-not and you get the server to own if you get me, its been a long time since i&#39;ve tried to make a server and I need some help.
So if the 24/7 provider only makes it 24/7 i would need to know how to sort of... Do it as in,
Make the server 24/7 then how to set it up.
Can anyone help, we&#39;d let you be our first admin if you&#39;d like!</description>
