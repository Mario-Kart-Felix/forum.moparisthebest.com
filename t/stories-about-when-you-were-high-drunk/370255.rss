    <title>Stories about when you were high/drunk</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stories-about-when-you-were-high-drunk/370255</link>
    <description>If there is anything in this world I absolutely love, it&#39;s sharing stories with people about when you were high or drunk. They are hilarious. So share a story about a time you were high or drunk.

Here&#39;s a recent one from me. Me and my two friends just got done smoking on my deck. My friend then started being retarded and doing 360s off of my chair cushion bin outside. He missed his footing and almost fell, but caught himself and kept stepping backwards with his arms out. He knocked over a huge ass pot of soil that was sitting on my banister and all of the soil went all over the grass. He began to laugh his ass off. I wasn&#39;t nearly as high enough to not give a fuck, so I started bitching at him to clean it up. He walks into my yard and starts shoveling it back into the pot with his bare hands. After he throws like 30% of it back into the pot, 5% of it being grass pulled out of my yard, he then picks up the pot of soil and goes to set it back on my banister from the other side. The dumbass pushed it too far and it fell and spilled all over my deck too. At that point, I just had to laugh because it was pretty fucking funny.</description>

              <p>The worst condition I’ve been in was alcohol poisoning, although I didn’t go to the hospital I just puked my guts out in my sleep. My friend said I slept with my eyes open and was probably running a fever of like 103 or something because I wouldn’t stop sweating.</p>
<p>But the funniest story? This one time I got high and I walked into a gas station to buy donuts and some milk. Well, I payed for all of it, but I left my wallet, the donuts, and the milk on the counter at the register and walked out. I later realized as I was getting into my friends car that I didn’t have my wallet… Nor anything I bought… So I went back in there and the guy suggested I drive safely. It was pretty fun.</p>

              <p>For all the people that say that this stuff is icky, social life pls.</p>
<p>On the 26th of January is Australia day. It’s an excuse for all us aus blokes to get absolutely wasted and to wander the streets causing shit. Last year about six of us got absolutely piss drunk and wondered around the streets until 5 in the morning. There is a skate park near the train station which we were sitting at, drinking, smoking etc when one of my mates asked if I wanted to try and oli him. Being in the state I was I thought it was a fucking fantastic idea. So we set him up in the middle of a jump and I descended down the jump. As I was getting closer and closer I actually realised how much of a fucking stupid idea this was, so I tried to change course. I bailed off the edge of the jump and landed dead on my left knee and skidded about a metre across some gravel. All my mates thought it was fucking sick and I thought it was pretty funny until I looked at my knee. Had to get twelve stitches from a huge gash running across my entire knee cap. Now a fucking awesome scar to remind me of why I don’t skate.</p>

Last year I was rolling and drunk (I drank lots of water so I was alright) at this party and I went home with a girl who was wasted and while she was in the bathroom I puked all under her couch. We hooked up on the same couch and she didn’t even notice the smell she was so drunk.<br>

              <p>Last year I was rolling and drunk (I drank lots of water so I was alright) at this party and I went home with a girl who was wasted and while she was in the bathroom I puked all under her couch. We hooked up on the same couch and she didn’t even notice the smell she was so drunk.</p>

              <p>Last November I passed out and was sick for first time whilst being drunk.<br>
I jumped off several sofas, landing on my knees, and fell down 2 sets of steep stairs… twice.<br>
I passed out from the hours of 12 o clock till 4 o clock, not knowing anything that happened between.</p>

              <p>If there is anything in this world I absolutely love, it’s sharing stories with people about when you were high or drunk. They are hilarious. So share a story about a time you were high or drunk.</p>
<p>Here’s a recent one from me. Me and my two friends just got done smoking on my deck. My friend then started being retarded and doing 360s off of my chair cushion bin outside. He missed his footing and almost fell, but caught himself and kept stepping backwards with his arms out. He knocked over a huge ass pot of soil that was sitting on my banister and all of the soil went all over the grass. He began to laugh his ass off. I wasn’t nearly as high enough to not give a fuck, so I started bitching at him to clean it up. He walks into my yard and starts shoveling it back into the pot with his bare hands. After he throws like 30% of it back into the pot, 5% of it being grass pulled out of my yard, he then picks up the pot of soil and goes to set it back on my banister from the other side. The dumbass pushed it too far and it fell and spilled all over my deck too. At that point, I just had to laugh because it was pretty fucking funny.</p>
