    <description>[SIZE=6]The Runescape Drop Simulator[/SIZE]
[FONT=Arial Narrow]Hello guys. And welcome to my thread. This is going to be my new project i am working in. Its a old school drop simulator. First let me start of by saying these are not 100% accurate. But i do my best to make them accurate. Let me also say that this will take some time to make. I am writting with javaFx so expect a beautiful interface :). I am making this for experience aswell so no hate right?

[SIZE=6]What is a drop simulator?[/SIZE]
The whole purpose of a drop simulator is to simulate the killing of an npc. Basically you will put in either the id of the npc or the name of the npc and this program will simulate you killing the npc. Pick up all it&#39;s loot and put it in the bank for you. But obviously all the loots/items will be within the application and not actual in your bank on osrs.

[SIZE=6]Why[/SIZE]
All the times that i played runescape i have always wondered &#39;Is it worth it killing that many .....&#39; So i will maybe make a drop simulator and give back to the community that i actually loved.
