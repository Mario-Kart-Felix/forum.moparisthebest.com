    <title>Changing the server port?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-server-port/10472</link>
    <description>hi im kinda new to the whole server thing, ive messed around with it and read some tutorials.  and while looking i could never find anything about changing the port to log into the server with.  because i have a router, and my parents like to keep it extra safe, i only have 1 port open to the outside.  that is my only hope of letting people log into my server, so if anyone knows hopw to change the port please let me know by posting.  also if you know of any tuts for testscape, i cant find any that tell me how to make the compile work right =/ i need that to change everything XD.  do please let me know bout that too.
thank you.

EDIT:: i figured out how to make the compiler work, but i get about 52 errors each time, most of them are just a //blah blah.  also when i compile, i cant find the compiled files.  on another server i tried, when i tried cheezscape the files were compiled and moved to the bottom of the folder, now when i compile on testscape i cant find the files, if you know where those are let me know also  :D</description>
