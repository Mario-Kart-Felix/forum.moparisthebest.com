    <title>End the Spamming: Advertisement Section</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/end-the-spamming-advertisement-section/341127</link>
    <description>So there is a section for classic advertisement but no rs2. You may say well there is a server status page. That is good except people still come on forums to advertise. I dont even like any of the servers on the status page except for like 3.

So to end the forum spamming of advertising in server download section, add a rs2 advertisement section.
People actually have a spot to post their advertisements instead of spamming the download section.
Discuss your opinion on this and Vote.

I know there is suggestions to improve the site but I wanted to do a poll and I think this should really be added.</description>

Get a team of people.</p>
<p>Get that team of people to looks to submission forms of advertised servers.</p>
<p>Servers that are sponsored are not accepted since they already earn a spot in another place.</p>
<p>By team of people. I mean a lot of people.</p>

<p>But the current amount of staff wouldn’t be able to handle that many submissions since they have other things to handle as well.</p>

The forum would get way more use than server status page within days. I still think it would be alot different than when it was tried in past. My main point is just give it another try because more people would use that than server status page<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why would it be any different than it was in the past exactly?  I see no reason to believe that would be the case.  Also what advantages would creating a topic have over entering a server on the serverstatus page?  Since I can list many advantages of the status page over a topic.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alot better staff then there was in the past id say. Also more people use the forums, servers would get more views and it would give servers a chance without 24/7 to get seen. Server status is good but in my opinion it just shows which servers are online the most and doesnt get your server much publicity.</p>

We already tried this, it was HORRIBLE.  So the answer is no.<br>

<p>When was this? Back in the day? 07? The server status is horrible, so would it make much of a difference?[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, back in 07.</p>
<p>The server status section was my best friend back then.</p>
<p>Now I rarely touch the server status page itself.</p>

              <p>They tried to fix the rep abuse many times, is it fixed yet? No, I doubt that they will add rs2 advertising since it is so big compared to RSC. There would be massive flame, trolling, spam, failing, gayness, etc. There is no point in trying it again since it failed so hard last time. I doubt the community is even ready for something like this when we can’t even control are rep.</p>

<p>Ya but it would be the same. Moparisthebest already said no so i doubt this will happen anymore. Some people bring up how servers with more likes on the server status page wont get noticed on this. This isnt the server status page so people will show how much they like a server by how many views and comments it has. I still dont see the reason for it not happening but I think there would be no problem and they should give it a try because it has been years.</p>

<p>AKA KrackkidTown, problems I mite see…</p>
<ol>
<li>People would be like “Omfg that server sucks only fucking queers would play it, how about you guys join myserver!”</li>
<li>People bump them for no reason with replys like “I JUST GOT 126!”</li>
<li>People spamming “OMFG delta fail”</li>
<li>People posting delta servers-.-…</li>
<li>Troll fest<br>
[/quote]</li>
</ol>
<p>Who cares, people will need to learn to have criticism. If people don’t like delta, and the person who posts it know it, they deserve flame.[/quote]<br>
Well I guess that about sums up this thread?, most-all topic will be locked do to spam/flame.</p>
