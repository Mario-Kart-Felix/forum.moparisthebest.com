    <title>Help with Hit Rate</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-hit-rate/381045</link>
    <description>The problem is that on the server i am using, the hits are a lot higher than what they are meant to be, meaning they have been changed somehow.

If it&#39;s possible, i need the code snippet where i can change this, as the hp is out of 99 but is at least 1000 before the player dies

Thanks!</description>
