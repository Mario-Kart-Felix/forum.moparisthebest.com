    <title>Topic concerning heat sinks and thermal compound</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/topic-concerning-heat-sinks-and-thermal-compound/379693</link>
    <description>So, I bought an Xbox 360 for 20 quid with a 120gb hdd and controller from a mate, because it was just lying around doing nothing, not bad? ikr.
Turned it on at home for the first time, all works fine, except the fan was going almost as loud as a hair dryer within 30 seconds, I just dealt with it at that point, but 2 days later, I opened it up to see what the problem was.

Being 5 years old and never opened up, it was dusty as anything, figuring this may be the problem, I cleaned it out completely, removing fans separately and cleaning them with a cloth and cleaning the rest with a dyson hoover.
Turned it on again, and still exactly the same, so I decided to begin removing the heatsinks.

After all that hassle, the cpu and gpu looked a little like this.

[url=http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/1310/19012011007.jpg]http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/1310/19012011007.jpg[/url]


First of all, is that what it&#39;s meant to look like?
I presume not, the &#39;lines&#39; seen in the images were actually indents into the paste about 2mm deep, not sure why that could have happened, though I have no experience with thermal compounds.

So I put it all back together, putting the heat sinks and all the screws back in, and turned her on again.
Within 10 seconds, it turned itself off due to overheating, giving the message on screen that it had done so.

I ensured the heat sinks were put back on tight, but I guess not tight enough.

Question is, is the thermal compound in need of replacement or not?


tl;dr, xbox overheats and turns off within 10 or so seconds, by looking at the images, is the thermal compound in need of replacement or is it something else?</description>

Yeah, that would work fine. Although you don’t need any of that fancy cleaning stuff, you could just use rubbing alcohol instead.[/quote]</p>

              <p>So, I bought an Xbox 360 for 20 quid with a 120gb hdd and controller from a mate, because it was just lying around doing nothing, not bad? ikr.<br>
Turned it on at home for the first time, all works fine, except the fan was going almost as loud as a hair dryer within 30 seconds, I just dealt with it at that point, but 2 days later, I opened it up to see what the problem was.</p>
<p>Being 5 years old and never opened up, it was dusty as anything, figuring this may be the problem, I cleaned it out completely, removing fans separately and cleaning them with a cloth and cleaning the rest with a dyson hoover.<br>
Turned it on again, and still exactly the same, so I decided to begin removing the heatsinks.</p>
<p>After all that hassle, the cpu and gpu looked a little like this.</p>

<p>First of all, is that what it’s meant to look like?<br>
I presume not, the ‘lines’ seen in the images were actually indents into the paste about 2mm deep, not sure why that could have happened, though I have no experience with thermal compounds.</p>
<p>So I put it all back together, putting the heat sinks and all the screws back in, and turned her on again.<br>
Within 10 seconds, it turned itself off due to overheating, giving the message on screen that it had done so.</p>
<p>I ensured the heat sinks were put back on tight, but I guess not tight enough.</p>
<p>Question is, is the thermal compound in need of replacement or not?</p>
<p>tl;dr, xbox overheats and turns off within 10 or so seconds, by looking at the images, is the thermal compound in need of replacement or is it something else?</p>
