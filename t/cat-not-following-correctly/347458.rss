    <title>Cat Not Following Correctly?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cat-not-following-correctly/347458</link>
    <description>Hi, for some reason I cannot get my hellcat to follow correctly, I think something is wrong with his WalkingType.

When I added my cat, it never kept up with me. But I logged into my server the next day when 17 were online and the NPCs were twitching. I noticed when the NPCs were twitching the cat followed me perfect and kept up with me. Anyone know why this happens?</description>
