You need to go through command-by-command, and make sure they are all setup correctly.</p>
<p>To make things easier you could create methods for each rights, and then create if statements in the processPacket() method to access each method via their rights…</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<p>[code=java]public void processPacket(Client c, int packetType, int packetSize) {<br>
String playerCommand = c.getInStream().readString();<br>
if (Config.SERVER_DEBUG)<br>
Misc.println(c.playerName + " playerCommand: " + playerCommand);<br>
if(c.playerRights &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &lt; 4)<br>
modCommand(c, playerCommand);<br>
}</p>
<p>private void modCommand(Client c, String playerCommand) {</p>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>Now any player that has playerRights greater than or equal to 1 AND less than 4, they can use any command placed in the “modCommands” method.</p>

<p>You really, really, really need to sort this nesting issue out.</p>
<p>To clarify: Nesting is what is causing them to not work properly.<br>
Ex:</p>
<p><code>  if (c.playerRights &gt; 1){
   if (c.playerRights == 0){
     // Will NEVER WORK because of the if statement it's nested in
   }
}</code></p>

<p>Make sure you’re adding the commands under the correct if statement. If you add all your commands under that if statement, only players who have &gt; 1 player rights will be able to use, and this is probably where you’re going wrong.</p>
