<blockquote>Now a few weeks later, and the drama continues after Michael DiVita qualified for the EPL Main Event after finishing 8th in the EPL Pro-Am event, only to later be blocked from registering for his tournament seat at the Palms Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas on Monday.
<p>Michael DiVita was subsequently stripped of his $20,000 seat at the Main Event and refunded his original $1,500 buy-in for the preliminary qualifier, before being escorted off the premises. His prize was then transferred to 10th place finisher Jamie Kaplan.</p>
<p>At the heart of the controvery, allegedly, is the fact it was brought to the attention of the Epic Poker League that Michael DiVita is a registered sex offender with a conviction dating back to 1991 for; “Assault with intent to commit a specified sex offense, annoy or molest child under 18 years of age, sexual battery and sexual battery involving a restrained person.”</p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong about buying that stuff, as long as you earned it. Yeah, he’s a molester, and I think that is the worst crime, but you can’t just take 20k from someone molester or not. They earned it, they deserve it.</p>

What happened in the past, stays in the past.<br>

<p>I don’t think I would go that far, would you like this guy to be your child’s teacher, for instance?[/quote]</p>
<p>It depends. I don’t have any children, so I guess I can’t really judge at the moment. I guess emotion takes over in such situations, and I’ll probably change my opinion. You’re a bit older than me, and expecting a child, so your opinion is probably the opposite of mine.</p>
<p>At the moment, I’d say that when someone has committed a sex crime 20 years ago, has been punished, and has been tested to see whether he is likely to do it again or not, and is expected to be no hazard, then yes, I’d be fine if he was my child’s teacher. But I say it again: I don’t have any children, so at this stage I evaluate it rationally, while I’ll probably weigh my emotions heavier when I actually have a child.</p>
<p>Besides, I don’t know the circumstances of the crime. That’s the problem with sex crimes: you almost immediately think of the worst type, rape, while it doesn’t have to be the case. I’ve done a quick Google search for his age, and if I’m correct he was 33 at the time of the crime. This matters, because a case involving a 17 year old and a 19 year old differs a lot from a case of someone under 18, and someone the age of 33. It also depends on where the crime was committed. The definition of sexual battery seems to differ in many states. </p><blockquote>Sexual battery may be defined as non-consensual touching of the intimate parts of another.</blockquote><br>
Which differs a lot from:
<blockquote>At least in Florida, "Sexual battery means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another or the anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object"</blockquote>
<p>I must admit, that men who sexually assault women intentionally, should be punished severely. Some do it because they are mentally ill, and should be treated. Some do it so they can be in power, and those should be dealt with harshly, as they know what they were doing.</p>
<p>The outside world can’t always judge, as seen in the Strauss-Kahn case. Was there consent or not? Did the maid change her mind midway? We don’t know, we weren’t there.</p>
<p>(The battery of my laptop is running low, so I just posted some loose thoughts.)</p>

<p>This is how democracy works. We don’t get our morals handed down but from a consensus of the people.<br>
By the way if you look at the treatment of minorities in a democracy and compare it to how they’re treated in say, a dictatorship, its clear that democracies have a much better track record.</p>
<p>Presumably it would be argued that black people and communists cannot cause harm to children in a tangible way, but pedophiles certainly can.</p>

        <p>If getting morals from the consensus of the people is not a good way, what other option is there?  A single ruler or group telling us what our morals should be?  But that’s a digression.</p>
<p>As yakman said, a communist or person of a different race wouldn’t be as likely to hurt children as a pedophile would.  Let’s put this in some other terms.  Look at Alcoholism, it’s generally accepted that it is a disease, and not one that you can be ‘cured’ from.  You can stop drinking and get sober, but even if you haven’t had a drink in 20 years, you are still an alcoholic.  (ask any recovering alcoholic, they will tell you the same).  Even though the Alcoholic hasn’t taken a drink in 20 years, you probably wouldn’t hire him as a bartender, or a master whiskey blender in your refinery, because you know the temptation is always there and it would be better for all involved to just keep them away from it.  The same is true for pedophiles.</p>

        <p>We have to be careful with calling someone a pedophile. As long as I don’t know anything else than the name of the crime DiVita has been charged with, I wouldn’t call him a pedophile. It is a possibility, although it might seem a bit far fetched, that the girl was almost turning 18, looked like she was much older and was initially consenting. I know this is a stereotype, but I see the average professional poker player as someone who lives by the morals of 'sex, drugs and rock ‘n roll’. Certainly not a monogamous Christian.</p>
<p>All in all, I wouldn’t call this guy a pedophile without having more info about the case.</p>

<p>It’s the best way I can think of, though. There might be better alternatives, but they only work in theory. Human beings are selfish, and most will make decisions that benefit them, and harm others. Besides, you need a standard set of morals in order to judge criminals.</p>
<p>A problem with getting morals from the consensus of the people is that the people aren’t educated properly. Too often you see someone with despicable ideas spreading his nonsense because he is charismatic. They bend reality, and are selective when it comes to arguing their case. Populist parties (British Nationalist Party, Partij Voor de Vrijheid, Die Freiheit, Perussuomalaiset, Dansk Folkeparti) in Europe are rising, which can only be explained by people being blinded by charisma. Besides spreading fear, they’re also Eurosceptic, which pisses me off.</p>
<p>Pedophilia is a mental illness. I doubt punishment has much, if any, effect on it. We call their deeds sick, but in their minds its completely normal. MITB is right when he says that you should keep alcoholics away from temptations, and the same applies to pedophiles. But that doesn’t mean you should lock them up, or even kill them. A while ago we got a new program here in the Netherlands. It’s called the ‘Buddy program’, where known pedophiles get a buddy assigned to them. This buddy guides them through difficult periods, and by doing so they prevent new crimes.</p>
<p>So yes, a true pedophile shouldn’t be allowed to be near children without supervision. But until experts conclude someone is a pedophile, you shouldn’t call, nor treat him like one.</p>

<p>It’s the best way I can think of, though. There might be better alternatives, but they only work in theory. Human beings are selfish, and most will make decisions that benefit them, and harm others. Besides, you need a standard set of morals in order to judge criminals.</p>
<p>A problem with getting morals from the consensus of the people is that the people aren’t educated properly. Too often you see someone with despicable ideas spreading his nonsense because he is charismatic. They bend reality, and are selective when it comes to arguing their case. Populist parties (British Nationalist Party, Partij Voor de Vrijheid, Die Freiheit, Perussuomalaiset, Dansk Folkeparti) in Europe are rising, which can only be explained by people being blinded by charisma. Besides spreading fear, they’re also Eurosceptic, which pisses me off.[/quote]I’ll have to go off-topic here. All those populist parties may be shit, but the EU is shit too.</p>

<p>So then we have not only laws in the hands of an unelected leader, but the army too? Wonderful!</p>

It is too much decision making. The Euro was a disaster, and it make the members even less democratic. Voting yes on EU-membership, our trying to get your country into EU should count as treason against the people and the country.</p>

There you have it, that is why I said it wasn’t a good way. Because if the people decided that killing Jews was good, it would become moral good, and you would make Hitler a good man. But then the word moral would lose it value, and rather become another word for law.</p>
