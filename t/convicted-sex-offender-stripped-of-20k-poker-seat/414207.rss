    <description>http://www.onlinepoker.net/poker-news/general-poker-news/sex-offender-disqualified-epic-poker-league/12081

Interested to see what you guys thoughts on this would be.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now a few weeks later, and the drama continues after Michael DiVita qualified for the EPL Main Event after finishing 8th in the EPL Pro-Am event, only to later be blocked from registering for his tournament seat at the Palms Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas on Monday.

Michael DiVita was subsequently stripped of his $20,000 seat at the Main Event and refunded his original $1,500 buy-in for the preliminary qualifier, before being escorted off the premises. His prize was then transferred to 10th place finisher Jamie Kaplan.

At the heart of the controvery, allegedly, is the fact it was brought to the attention of the Epic Poker League that Michael DiVita is a registered sex offender with a conviction dating back to 1991 for; “Assault with intent to commit a specified sex offense, annoy or molest child under 18 years of age, sexual battery and sexual battery involving a restrained person.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

Would like to know what the actual context of his crime was, but it sounds like he’s a sex pervert, so fuck him. He’d probably only spend his winnings on asian child dolls, sweets, and white vans with matresses in.<br>

There’s nothing wrong about buying that stuff, as long as you earned it. Yeah, he’s a molester, and I think that is the worst crime, but you can’t just take 20k from someone molester or not. They earned it, they deserve it.[/quote]</p>
<p>I Agree.</p>

RSC, not sure if I agree with you. As I said, I don’t think pedophillia can be “cured” as such, maybe just surpressed. Again, im not sure if I think a pedo could ever become a “normal member of society”. I’d rather go with the “put them away forever” option.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>As far as I know, it can’t be cured, and has to be restrained. And it can be restrained, which means that pedophiles can be (almost) normal members of society, albeit with a few restrictions. It’s far better, and more humane, than putting them away forever.[/quote]You can’t cure pedophilia just like you can’t cure homosexuality, they’re surprisingly similar in nature. And just to clarify, i am neither anti-pedo nor anti-homo</p>

<p>As far as I know, it can’t be cured, and has to be restrained. And it can be restrained, which means that pedophiles can be (almost) normal members of society, albeit with a few restrictions. It’s far better, and more humane, than putting them away forever.</p>

<p>While I agree there is a different level of help here, as re-orienting human sexuality is a task most believe to be impossible, I think treatment can be used to help prevent them from acting on their urges. This could help prevent pedophiles from becoming child molestors.<br>
However, now that I look over my argument in retrospect, it sounds awfully just as bad as demonizing them as they will still be sexually repressed… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>In the U.S. and most other nations, simply being attracted to minors is not criminal. Committing sexual acts, however, is; I disagree that such acts are the /de facto/ “actions of a pedo”, though.</p>

<p>Gambling, i don’t think, can be compared to anything like pedophillia. The worst outcome for a gambler? Loses everything they own, generally only a superficial loss. Worst outcome for an ‘ill’ pedo? A minor is abused, affecting the rest of their life, their families life, and generally just fucking up when it comes to modern societies morals and models.</p>

              <p>I don’t think gambling in itself is an illness, but from where I’m from, typically if you gamble you are looked generally down upon. Irresponsible gambling, however, /is/ a mental illness, just like most addictions.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Mr</span>. Chris: Why’s that? There is a difference between having a mental disorder which causes you to like children and the act of violating them (both directly, by molestation, or indirectly, by distributing child porn). Similarly, is paraphilia (objektophil) a crime?</p>
<p>To clarify on some stuff I mentioned earlier, what I mean by treat doesn’t mean to <em>cure</em>; you can’t cure homosexuality, bisexuality, etc. and attempts so far have been shown to be destructive.</p>
<blockquote>Pedophilia, like many types of disturbances or diseases, does not have a complete cure. The sexual urges associated with pedophilia may never permanently disappear, and a person’s sexual preference and orientation can be difficult to completely re-orient. At present, treatment primarily focuses on preventing further offenses rather than changing sexual orientation.</blockquote>
