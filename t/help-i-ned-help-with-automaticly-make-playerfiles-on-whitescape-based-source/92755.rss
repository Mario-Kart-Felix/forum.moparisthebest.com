    <description>Well, i havent bin in Java for about a year.
And now i&#39;m back to my favorite Source = WhiteScape.

But the server wont make the PlayerFiles, i have to make them Myself for each user.
And i dont know if i want that...

Becouse i am not planning to make a register page on the Website.

Any1 able to post me a tut for fixing this ?
