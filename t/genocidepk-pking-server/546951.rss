[B]Game Media might not look good, but if you try it. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find it enjoyable to play. I&#39;m still learning guys, cmon!
Pking is really good. It&#39;s actually great. Bonuses on items, delays, autocasting with magick, you name it.[/B]

[B]About us:[/B]
As of right now, we are in Beta Testing and trying to desperately get a full on VPS, 
auto donation system, voting site, and of course a Forums!
GenocidePk is a new RSPS created by Paradox. The server is based on Instantly Pking and having a good time doing it. 
For now the server is in Beta. The server still needs a little testing, but we&#39;re getting there. 
We currently don&#39;t have a Website for now until somewhere in the Weekend or Monday, 9/29/2014. 
In GenocidePk you will log in and Instantly have items waiting for you in your bank ready to Pk. 
There is also a Spawn Tab for people who just want to grab some gear and Pk or you can select an InstaEquip Tab.
Training is not needed in this server, you will be set automatically to combat level 126. 
You will have the option to change your stats if you wish. For those who enjoy the skilling in a private server, 
most skills have been reworked to to benifit your desires.
