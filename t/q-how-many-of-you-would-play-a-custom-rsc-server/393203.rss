    <title>[Q] How many of you would play a custom rsc server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/q-how-many-of-you-would-play-a-custom-rsc-server/393203</link>
    <description>I was wondering how many people would play a rsc-based game that would have a custom landscape, items, quests, people, wildy etc...
It would be the same quality as the normal rsc and wouldn&#39;t be stupid like the servers that have random rune armour sitting on the ground.</description>
