    <title>[PI] Fatal Error Drop packet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-fatal-error-drop-packet/535962</link>
    <description>so after a few hours of testing my server the drops where working perfectly, i didnt change a single thing at all afterwords just wentout and did somthing, came back to hop back on the server to test it again and i  noticed now when i kill an npc it dosnt drop anything, i thought it was just the odds whacking up but then i skimmed through the pannel and it was giving me this error:&lt;blockquote&gt;FATAL: couldnt find connection Vertex! Dropping packet!&lt;/blockquote&gt; Im still somewhat a nub to defineing errors, so i skimmed around and made sure config.java was ok and also checked meh droping file and nothing was out of place, nor was anyone in my house at the time i left so i cant quite figure out what happened?  anyone be able to help? thanks

Here it is in player.java
&lt;blockquote&gt;}
			else found = true;	

			if(!found) println_debug(&quot;Fatal: couldn&#39;t find connection vertex! Dropping packet.&quot;);
			else {
				wQueueWritePtr = wQueueReadPtr;		

				addToWalkingQueue(currentX, currentY);	

				if(dir != -1 &amp;&amp; (dir&amp;1) != 0) {
					

					for(int i = 0; i &lt; numTravelBackSteps-1; i++) {
						addToWalkingQueue(travelBackX[i], travelBackY[i]);
					}
					int wayPointX2 = travelBackX[numTravelBackSteps-1], wayPointY2 = travelBackY[numTravelBackSteps-1];
					int wayPointX1, wayPointY1;
					if(numTravelBackSteps == 1) {
						wayPointX1 = currentX;
						wayPointY1 = currentY;
					}
					else {
						wayPointX1 = travelBackX[numTravelBackSteps-2];
						wayPointY1 = travelBackY[numTravelBackSteps-2];
					}
					
					dir = Misc.direction(wayPointX1, wayPointY1, wayPointX2, wayPointY2);
					if(dir == -1 || (dir&amp;1) != 0) {
						println_debug(&quot;Fatal: The walking queue is corrupt! wp1=(&quot;+wayPointX1+&quot;, &quot;+wayPointY1+&quot;), &quot;+
							&quot;wp2=(&quot;+wayPointX2+&quot;, &quot;+wayPointY2+&quot;)&quot;);
					}&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
