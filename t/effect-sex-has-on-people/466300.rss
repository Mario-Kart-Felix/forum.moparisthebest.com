    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/effect-sex-has-on-people/466300</link>
    <description>this started in another thread but anyways what does everyone thing are the effects of sex besides the obvious well known ones.

I think it has negative effects when its premarital and should have laws banning premarital sex.

discuss.

<p>The argument is that the mutual respect between you and the authority should at least allow you to respect the request enough to attempt to fulfill it. Not simply push it aside because you have no respect for anyone.</p>
<p>So, you should respect the request of a mentor or parent asking you to not to do something because it may have consequences in a certain situation. In the case of a fighter, masturbation or sex before a fight may (or may not) cause him the fight. Just respect the fact that they have been in the situation before and probably know what they might be talking about.[/quote]</p>
<p>This guy knows exactly what he’s talking about.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@L</span>&amp;P, just because you don’t have the discipline to do such a thing doesn’t mean my fighters don’t have enough respect for me to do that. Every single one of them carries the biggest ego you could ever imagine alongside a huge sense of pride. Pride in how tough they are, pride in their bodies, pride in their life. They will do <span class="bbcode-b">whatever</span> it takes to win the fight or better themselves. Everyone wants to be the best and to be the best they need to listen to what I say and follow it. If I find one of my fighters has disobeyed and lied to me I just throw them out of the gym and they can go elsewhere, if they’re not serious about being the best they can be and lying to the person who’s teaching them then they don’t belong with the rest of my serious fighters.</p>
<p>TL;DR just because you don’t have the discipline don’t be so naive as to suggest no-one can.[quote=“tyb97, post:41, topic:466300”][quote author=imsuperman05 link=topic=579174.msg4150676#msg4150676 date=1352420090]<br>

Don’t worry a majority of this thread hasn’t either, even though they have claimed too.[/quote]</p>
<p>What gives you the right to say that, lol? Most people here are 17/18+ and you don’t know them IRL so what would make you have the right to say that? I sincerely hope you’re not one of those idiots who thinks just because someone knows how to program and likes runescape that it automatically makes them into someone who is a general “geeky-type” person.</p>

<p>Now what parent is really going to tell their child "son, I don’t want you to masturbate for  2 weeks "[/quote]<br>
The argument is that the mutual respect between you and the authority should at least allow you to respect the request enough to attempt to fulfill it. Not simply push it aside because you have no respect for anyone.</p>
<p>So, you should respect the request of a mentor or parent asking you to not to do something because it may have consequences in a certain situation. In the case of a fighter, masturbation or sex before a fight may (or may not) cause him the fight. Just respect the fact that they have been in the situation before and probably know what they might be talking about.</p>

</aside>
<p>Thanks for the point of view, but wouldn’t you also attribute your decisions to the way your parents raised you? It may have not be “poor parenting”, but your decisions reflect your parents in the eyes of other people. Socially, there’s no way to avoid people trying to blame parents for their children even if the child is aware of the consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>While I think you’re correct, in a sense, I can’t help but think about how others would see that.</p>

              <p>Pre-marital sex is NOT bad. Sex is proven to be healthy for humans (unless your having protected sex with someone that has HIV or something…). I’m pretty sure its healthy from the age of 13+, I’m not saying do it if your 13+.<br>
Their are some social negative effects like lower morals but hey, who gives a shit about morals.<br>
But in regards to your actual thread name, sex does have a negative affect on people because of the things people do to get it at times… But of course the positives outweigh the negatives.<br>
offtopic but in regards to posts in the thread:<br>
Your testosterone levels don’t constantly build up from not using your dick… You’d have constant blue balls (look up the term if you don’t know what it means) if it did. Testosterone makes you more athletically capable along with other things.<br>
When a males horny, more testosterone than usual is released into the males system making him more athletically capable for a period of time.<br>
Having sex right before something of course would tire you out but if you had it long enough [or wanked etc] before the event you’d perform better.</p>
<p>3 weeks of no sex+fapping would make my old rabbit (&lt;/3) be more aggressive in a fight, not me - it’d make me sexually frustrated but thats about it, maybe a bit pissy at worst. We’re humans, we’re not that low a calibre of mamel.</p>

LP, I don’t see why you have a hard time understanding the concept of not masturbating. Plenty of people do. Hell, I usually find myself stopping for a month or even longer. No one has that much sexual urge to just masturbate all the time.</p>
<p>Trying to understand the concept of mutual respect between people of higher ranking must be hard for you as well. Let’s put in a hypothetical scenario that you may or may not understand.</p>
<p>A 16 year old boy is going to a party. His father tells him not to get in trouble and don’t do drugs or drink. The mutual respect between the boy and his father should allow him to deny any of the aforementioned substances or getting into trouble. It’s simply expected, not required. Because the outcome of doing the opposite is generally bad for the person in subjective ways. In this case, the child gets punished if he gets caught.</p>
<p>It’s not about “well, he shouldn’t have gotten caught” its that he shouldn’t have been doing it anyway. He should wait 'til he’s of legal age to make those types of decisions.<br>
[/quote]one thing, when you tell a teenager don’t do drugs they going to go do the total opposite.</p>
<p>/facepalm[/quote]</p>
<p>In the case of your upbringing, maybe. I don’t know you that well so I can’t say. In mine, I have never done drugs. Why? My parents told me not to. Everyone is different.</p>
