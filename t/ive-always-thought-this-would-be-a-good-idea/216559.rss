    <title>I&#39;ve always thought this would be a good idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ive-always-thought-this-would-be-a-good-idea/216559</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been thinking about talking to my schools IT department about setting up a forum for all the students and teachers to use with their usernames and accounts. I don&#39;t know if it has been done in any of your schools, but I think this could work and help improve student/teacher relations (through help boards ect), student/student relations (boards to talk about general crap) and then private teacher/teacher boards ect. 

is this a good idea? have you seen it implemented anywhere else?</description>

              <p>It actually sounds like a great idea, I too have thought about something like this.

<p>Not a forum exactly but our high school has a site that shows our grades and we can ask our teachers questions and stuff. Forum would make it alot easier seeing as you could get help from everyone not just one person.</p>
