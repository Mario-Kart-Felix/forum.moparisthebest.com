    <title>Connect to the official servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connect-to-the-official-servers/23167</link>
    <description>Hello, 
im new here so i will introduce myself first.
Im Chris from holland. I am a programmer in C#, PHP and i can do VB to (thats not a language of my choice)
I saw this cool Client and Server in one. I am more interessted in the Client part.

I would like to know if it is possible to connect to the official runescape servers with this client.
The server page on this site is down so that couldnt help my firther, and i tried to get the ip out of the packets.
I found a couple but it doesnt seem to work. I get messages that there is an unkown response.

I hope someone can help me with this, or someone may tell me how to connect to an official server.

Many THanks
Chris.</description>
