<p>Right maybe I should have said I felt that they got bad, not due to what the games like but just my own intrests etc but if you are just thinking about how games are atm is normal its not. Its on a downwards slope but it’ll go back up again ofc. Resesion &gt; money &gt; quality of games the easiest way to put it for you and when the boom in gamings back the quality will improve.</p>
<p>Sigh, people always think too small on these forums.</p>

              <p>Let’s talk about how Resident Evil series has changed into action genre:<br>
Resident Evil 1 and the remake are horror and puzzle solving, you can actually get scared while playing it(Atleast while playing remake, but back when RE1 was released I bet lots of people were scared while playing it)<br>
Resident Evil 2 is just as good as the first one.<br>
Resident Evil 3 Not as good as 1 or 2, but still awesome.<br>
Resident Evil 4 - Too much action, about 1 or 2 easy puzzles that even a 4 year old can solve, not scary at all.<br>
Resident Evil 5 - Purely action now, there’s no way at all you get scared while playing this, the gameplay is just annoying as hell and the only thing that was improved since 4th was the graphics.</p>
<p>Yet they call it a horror game…</p>
<p>Team Fortress 2:<br>
The achievement weapons were just fine, but they decided to add shitloads of overpowered and stupid weapons, which you can get by either idling, or buying from the ‘<a href="http://Mann.Co" rel="nofollow noopener">Mann.Co</a>’ store.The main goal of the game now is to get an unusual hat which is pointless, some even pay 50$ for one.</p>
<p>I don’t think I have to explain how RS has gone to shit.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft:<br>
I can’t find the right word to describe how it went to worse way, but it just feels too casual now.</p>

</aside>
<p>The games have evolved yes, the content hasn’t. Also, there were many more billion pounds of money put into the gaming industry in the start of this century as games were an amazing return for investors(approx 1.6x averaged out) but now its usually around 1.2x averaged out meaning there is less investment meaning the quality isn’t improving at a fast a rate. The way I’m trying to put the point across is bad i know but its all valid information if you don’t believe me feel free to google it.</p>
