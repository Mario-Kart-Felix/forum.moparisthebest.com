    <description>ok so heres what im trying to accomplish here.

I&#39;m trying to make it to where i can adjust player movement speed so the higher your agility the faster you can run. so far im in player.java and i can only find runenergy stuff. not asking someone to completely do everything for me but just point me in the right direction. thanks.</description>

              <p>Lol, run energy doesn’t determine how fast one moves… It just how long they can run for.</p>
<p>Look at walking/running and how that is done, I’m sure if you change a few values you can get faster running.</p>
