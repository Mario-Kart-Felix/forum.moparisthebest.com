    <title>With my grand exchange</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/with-my-grand-exchange/226417</link>
    <description>Ok well i started developing a grand exchange and so far i have this:
- Deposit Any Item In The Game
- ::exitems Shows all your deposited items (3 max)
- ::exremove # Removes the item 1-3 from the grand exchange...
- Savemorinfo saves item id&#39;s + amounts
- Loadmoreinfo loads item ids + amounts

But now with the buying i need to be able to do these things...

- ::exsearch searches through all grand exchange items
- ::exbuy (itemnamehere) to buy an item if it is in grand exchange.

But they are player variables(items/amounts)... how can i like... get them from every person online in a &#39;for&#39; statement? i tried and failed lol.</description>

              <p>you could just make a “sendQuest” interface thing to show ALL items in the server, or are you trying to show a list of all the items that EACH person has in the server like…</p>
<pre><code>             --billy322---
                  has
</code></pre>
<p>1.Bandos Godsword (set at a price of) 1.5m<br>
2.White Partyhat  (set at a price of) 12m<br>
3.DragonFire Sheild (set at a price of) 100m</p>
<p>are you trying to do that ^ as your grand exchange, where you set the price for each sold item?</p>
