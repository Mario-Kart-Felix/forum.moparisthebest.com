              <p>Unless you get an ‘OutOfMemoryException’ every 5-10 mins, you don’t need more ram. Dodian servers are a little better and more crash resistant to wL based servers.</p>
<p>So, more ram is not the answer, the answer is more Bandwidth. Try contacting your ISP about increasing the Upload speed on your home network. If you don’t control your Internet at your home, (you live w/ your parents… i.e), Your out of luck…</p>
