    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eyfiascape-request/444952</link>
    <description>Hey, If anyone still has EyfiaScape I would love to use the source and client. Eyfia took his download links down so they are no use when you download them you get a txt document saying to many leachers if someone could re upload them and send them please. Thank You.</description>
