    <title>How to get rid of quests? Delta 317 source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-rid-of-quests-delta-317-source/351490</link>
    <description>Alright so I&#39;ve recently been working on this new source I picked up and I don&#39;t like the idea of quests in a private server, especially since they limit certain items unless you complete them. I&#39;ve been searching through everything to try and find out how to correctly delete them, but it always ends up with a huge error. Basically what I need is to get rid of the text in the questlog, get rid of the requirements on certain items/prayers, and get rid of the quests and the npc&#39;s assosiated with them. I realize this is going to be difficult to do, so any help at all is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</description>

Alright thank you very much, will let you know how it goes.</p>
<p>EDIT: Ehh…any way you could be a bit more specific with the backspace? i deleted like everything that has to do with quests, got 100 errors…<br>

<p>You’ve probably forgot a few } here and there.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alright. Will try adding them where they seem logical. I’m pretty new to all this so it’ll probably take awhile.</p>
