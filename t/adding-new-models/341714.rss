    <title>Adding new models</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-new-models/341714</link>
    <description>Ok, I feel like an idiot for having to ask this [I have looked through tuts, both on here and using google, and went through a few pages of help topics looking], but I can not add new models. I am using Corby Xevolution source, and its come-with client. I know most people dispise this, but I just started today with everything about model-editting [the datamaker, metasqueia {did I say that right?}, and converting to gZIP (I used 7zip to covnert to gzip)]. I followed a tutorial, in which, after converting through the file types to open it in metas----, I used 3385, for a dragon halberd, and simply re-colored it to a brighter yellow/blue as a &quot;holy halberd&quot;. Saved the model, converted back, used datamaker and did the &quot;Right-Hand&quot; [after changing the 0 to 10] and zipping as a .gz file. I am using the model id 13000 for the wield and 13001 as the drop. I already modified the Class8 in the client, and I copy/pasted the files into the anim/Models folder [its the only model folder I saw]. I then, even though the tutorial did not say to, added the information for the item into the item.cfg of the source [bottom of list], with the item id 50000 [which was also used in the class8]. The problem is when I log in to the server, I type &quot;Add model 13000&quot; and/or &quot;Add model 13001&quot; and it always tells me that the model can not be found, something like &quot;Unable to find model file.&quot;, and then I can not move or log out (but can still talk) until it disconnects me for a split second. After a couple of attempts, I copied the model files into every folder I could think or see that had any model files in them, or any connection to models, and no matter what attempt, it still failed. Also, as a side note, when I typed &quot;::pickup 50000 1&quot; it said &quot;Not a true item.&quot; or &quot;Item not found.&quot; or something of the sort. This is really stressing me, because I&#39;ve read quite a few tutorials [including the &quot;biggest tutorial ever&quot; on this site] on what and how to do this, and it just does not work. I know this was long, and I appreciate all help this community gives. Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>Hmm, it didn’t work. Now, there was improvement, it didn’t say “No item found.”, but it didn’t have any effect. I checked the log, and it showed the command entering, but there was no item added. I then checked if the code became faulty by some idiot mistake I would have probably made, so I “::pickup 995 1”'d and it worked fine. Is there something I’m missing?</p>
<p>Edit: The pickup code is as follows:</p>
<p><code>	    if (command.startsWith("pickup") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {
		        String[] args = command.split(" ");
	         if(args.length == 3) {
			int newItemID = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
			int newItemAmount = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
			if (newItemID &lt;= 160000 &amp;&amp; newItemID &gt;= 0) {
				addItem(newItemID, newItemAmount);
			} else {
				sM("No such item.");
			}
		} else {
			sM("Oops! Use as ::pickup 995 100");
		}
	    }
}</code></p>
<p>I noticed what message it should send in the “else” statements, but, neither of those messages where sent, implying it worked, the item just isn’t there. I ran my mouse through each posistion of the inventory, and no name showed up [as in checking for a faulty model].</p>
<p>Edit2: I added the item manually to my bank, and when I opened the bank, it showed itself as dwarf remains, and then crashed me. Every time I opened the bank, I got the same result until, after 3 times, it did not automatically re-connect. Any help?</p>
<p>Server bat said this:</p>
<p><code>Exception encountered while parsing incoming packets from Kingkj52.
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 19999
        at client.fromBank(client.java:9972)

        at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)
ClientHandler: Client Kingkj52 disconnected (127.0.0.1)</code></p>
<p>I’m guessing there is some sort of limit on how high the id goes all around. How or where can I change that?</p>

Still though, when I “::pickup 50000 1” it tells me “No such item.” Is there somewhere else, other then item.cfg, that I should put that information at. If so, where and what should I put?

<p>After the downloads are done and decompiled…<br>
Open up item int list and search(control+F) for the item you want for a base for your custom item.  Under it, you should see<br>
Code:<br>
//male wield viewthe number to the left is the one you need to remember.</p>
<p>Open up…<br>
datamaker.exe<br>
Now open up the METASEQUOIA folder, but not the .exe<br>
and make a new folder called models.  On DATMAKER, file&gt;open&gt;metasequoia&gt;models.  No you File&gt;open&gt;rsmodel viewer&gt;models&gt;####(item number)<br>
click on it and it should display on the screen, the File&gt;export&gt;MQO</p>
<p>Now open up…<br>
metasequoia.exe and File&gt;open&gt;metasequoia&gt;models&gt;####.MQO<br>
(if its not there, just try to find it, its in a folder somewhere, lol)<br>
it should spring up on the screen, now you may edit it to your hearts’ desire.</p>
<p>After that…<br>
go to file&gt;save as&gt;metasequoia&gt;models&gt;ITEM NAME W<br>
W stands for wield<br>
Now select all of your new custom weapon, and move it to the ground, and rotate it, so looks flat and is adjacent to the ground.<br>
File&gt;Save as&gt;Metasequoia&gt;Models&gt;ITEM NAME D<br>
D stands for drop</p>
<p>Ok, now that that’s done…<br>
go back to your RS datmaker program, and import the wield model now at the top next to a green box it should say<br>
Code:<br>
prioritiesselect that box, and your weapon will have black dots all over it.<br>
on the bottome left corner, you should see<br>
Code:<br>
0/0change the first 0 to 10.<br>
Now there should be a dropbox that says no anim, open it and scroll down to right-hand and select.  Now click make .dat button</p>
<p>Do the same for the drop model, but instead of right-hand, it should be no anim.</p>
<p>Open up…<br>
7z folder and open 7zFM.  Find metasequoia&gt;models<br>
then select the wield model and click on the green ‘+’ key<br>
a screen should pop up, then click ok.  Do the same for the drop model.<br>
now drag the wield model and drag it to your clients model folder.  Rename it to 13000.gz.  Drag the drop model and rename it 13001.gz.</p>
<p>Go open up…<br>
class8.java, search for<br>
Code:<br>
class8.method203(true, aClass30_Sub2_Sub2_183);<br>
underneath add this</p>
<p>Code:<br>
if(i == Item Number) {<br>
class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];<br>
class8.aStringArray189[1] = “Wield”;//New option<br>
class8.anInt174 = Drop Model Number; //Model ID // 20233<br>
class8.anInt181 = 2000; //zoom increase will make it smaller<br>
class8.anInt190 = 572; //model rotate up+down increase to move doen away from you<br>
class8.anInt198 = 0; //model rotate side ways increase to move right in circle<br>
class8.anInt169 = 25; // model offset increase to move to the right<br>
class8.anInt194 = 1; //model offset increase to move up<br>
class8.anInt165 = Wield Model Number;//male wearing //<br>
class8.anInt200 = Wield Model Number;//female wearing //<br>
class8.anInt164 = -1;//Female arms/sleeves //<br>
class8.anInt188 = -1;//male arms/sleeves //<br>
class8.aBoolean176 = false;//Stackable<br>
class8.aString170 = “Item Name”;//Name of the new item<br>
class8.aByteArray178 = “Item Examine Info”.getBytes();//examin info<br>
}</p>
<p>ok, ITEM Number denotes the item id you want<br>
Drop Model Number denotes the .gz file, which in this case is 13001<br>
Wield Model Number denotes the .gz file, which in this case is 13000<br>
Item Name denotes the name of your item<br>
Item Examine Info denotes what the description is if you ingame examine it.</p>
<p>Finally…<br>
save and compile, then run your server.<br>
Once on your server you must say this</p>
<p>Code:<br>
add model 13000and<br>
Code:<br>
add model 13001It should say Item Model found, or something like that.<br>
Then do ::pickup ITEM-ID AMOUNT</p>
<p>If I missed anything, please post, or pm me.<br>
I think this should be stickied, but that’s my opinion.</p>
<p>Good job.<br>
To me.[/code]</p>
<p>Death, where can I find that? I’d assume its in the client.java, but what could I specifically search for, as I have tried searching, but with no prevail.</p>
<p>P.S.: Thanks for the speedy replies and insight, I truly appreciate it. =]</p>

              <p>Ok, I feel like an idiot for having to ask this [I have looked through tuts, both on here and using google, and went through a few pages of help topics looking], but I can not add new models. I am using Corby Xevolution source, and its come-with client. I know most people dispise this, but I just started today with everything about model-editting [the datamaker, metasqueia {did I say that right?}, and converting to gZIP (I used 7zip to covnert to gzip)]. I followed a tutorial, in which, after converting through the file types to open it in metas----, I used 3385, for a dragon halberd, and simply re-colored it to a brighter yellow/blue as a “holy halberd”. Saved the model, converted back, used datamaker and did the “Right-Hand” [after changing the 0 to 10] and zipping as a .gz file. I am using the model id 13000 for the wield and 13001 as the drop. I already modified the Class8 in the client, and I copy/pasted the files into the anim/Models folder [its the only model folder I saw]. I then, even though the tutorial did not say to, added the information for the item into the item.cfg of the source [bottom of list], with the item id 50000 [which was also used in the class8]. The problem is when I log in to the server, I type “Add model 13000” and/or “Add model 13001” and it always tells me that the model can not be found, something like “Unable to find model file.”, and then I can not move or log out (but can still talk) until it disconnects me for a split second. After a couple of attempts, I copied the model files into every folder I could think or see that had any model files in them, or any connection to models, and no matter what attempt, it still failed. Also, as a side note, when I typed “::pickup 50000 1” it said “Not a true item.” or “Item not found.” or something of the sort. This is really stressing me, because I’ve read quite a few tutorials [including the “biggest tutorial ever” on this site] on what and how to do this, and it just does not work. I know this was long, and I appreciate all help this community gives. Thanks in advance.</p>
