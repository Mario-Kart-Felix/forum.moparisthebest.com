    <description>Hi, I need some help with my server.


Its a 317, Dodian Base but I want to stop the xp rate it gives now.  I KNOW HOW TO AND I DID.
But my problem is I need to find out how to make it so - (Oh btw I need this for the npc 1 ((which is a man)))



So when the npc (man) dies by the player attacking it

give 25 xp
sendMessage you have gained 25 xp.



Can anyone help with that?</description>
