    <description>Hi guys,

After a lot of thinking and deciding we are please to announce we are going to be opening a Pking / Staking server in the very near future... As many will be getting ready for the summer we will be working hard on having the server stable, As bug free as possible and ready for pking / staking!!

[u][b]a few of the features are as follows:[/b][/u]
*Rune armour and weapons already in bank ( Amount to be agreed on)
*A certain amount of swordfish and sharks will be placed into bank also.
*Fire bolt, Fire blast and fire wave will be put into your banks.
*Normal strength potions added to banks.
*CTF -We will have a fully working capture the flag type of scenario for people wanting to a bit more than pking and staking.

-We will be testing a combat formula that adapts to pking and staking although i don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to perfect it to everyone&#39;s needs or it would have been done before now.

-Combat rates will be quite high but not too high as people do like to have lower level accounts also.

[b]I WILL BE WORKING ON HOW TO MAKE THE GAME FREE OF SUBSCRIPTION CARDS ECT[/b]

I believe that making the most basic of tasks such as : Global chat, Use of portals, Staking ect. It&#39;s absurd to make it a Subscriber only feature.


I would like to ask one big thing that people could help us on: What would you like to see that you feel would make this server successful for all players?</description>

Not sure what you mean by that comment, But i will say one thing, There is a very big group of pkers and a group of stakers that are only wanting to do that one thing PK and Stake, Anything can be successful if you listen to the players and make the right choices. The fact you have not even put an ounce of input and the fact you decide to be negative already shows the support you have for RSC in general, There is hardly any servers out there at all now especially ones which are not corrupt or after money alone. Me personally i just want the old pking scene back, That’s just me though not everyone else… But if you can do better by all means create one yourself using your own money and i’ll give it a try. Not one single person will force you to play final-pk when it’s up i’m merely offering a endless grinding day to day of skills and farming items and just getting straight to the point… PKING.<br>

<p>Until you have a succesful server ran, Keep you negative comments to yourself, Plenty of succesful people have failed many times before creating something that works.</p>
<p>but yeh good job on sitting putting negative comment to people, People like you are the reason nobody can be bothered no more… you yourself bring the community down because you can leave negative comments but don’t even have your own server? or if you do i’ve never heard of it. GROW UP.</p>
