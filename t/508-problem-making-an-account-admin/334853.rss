    <title>[508] Problem making an account Admin?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-problem-making-an-account-admin/334853</link>
    <description>Alright, so up to now I&#39;ve been doing 317s. I JUST started with 508s, and I recently downloaded the extium-pkz source. (It is a 508.) I have looked everywhere for a TUT on how to do this, and read through maybe 15 of them, but I can&#39;t seem to get it to work.

I open up my source folder and get 3 folders:
[b]bin[/b] (this has the compile and run cmds.)
[b]build
src[/b]

Inside [b]&quot;build&quot;[/b] I find:
banned
characters
connection accts
connection dates
items
mapdata
npcs
noclip.cfg

I have been told that in order to make an account admin/owner or whatever, I have to go into &quot;characters&gt;mainsave.&quot; So i go into mainsave and find my account (the only one, obviously.)

I open the &quot;accountname&quot;.dat file with notepad to get this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;username:&quot;ACCOUNTNAME&quot; password:&quot;PASSSSWORRRD&quot; ip:&quot;IP IP IP IP IP&quot; rights:0 starter:1 jailed:0 [size=10pt]...and so on...[/size]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I change the rights to &quot;2&quot; then save. I log into my account and nothing has changed. I am lost. :( Help would be [b]Greatly[/b]  appreciated. Thanks in advance. (:</description>
