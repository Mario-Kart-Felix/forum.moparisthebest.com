    <description>Well I was bored and decided to create a framework and its extremely shitty but it was worth a shot. Just standard IO. Only made this for learning purposes not planning to use it. Referenced a few things. Everything except for Stream, ISAACCipher and some of the login protocol was created by me.

When a player connects and passes through the gateway, a new client object is created and sent to the reactor engine where it is added too a queue and every 150ms the queue is polled and each client is logged in. I honestly have/had no clue what I was doing, so that design is probably retarded in itself.

Although, I did get a successful login :)

There are two problems though. One being, it always reads the username and password as null. I&#39;ll probably figure this out by myself.

And two being its really inconsistent. By this I mean sometimes it logs in, sometimes it doesn&#39;t (which is weird). I have also noticed it connects three times before anything is actually done, which is again weird. Honestly, I think that problem is probably just from the shitty overall design of this. Oh well, I&#39;m learning :)

Discussion:

What can I do to improve this?

Why is the design bad, and a solution to the bad design?

It would really be helpful if someone did a rundown on I/O streams. Only thing that really confuses me at this point.

idk maybe people can learn something lol</description>

<p>Oooh, IO. I’ve seen very few with IO, nice though. Definitely a learning experience I’m sure.</p>

<p>its not like im going to be implementing the reactor pattern design any time soon :P, so IO for now hahaha</p>
