    <title>Haircut</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/haircut/386666</link>
    <description>Hey guys. Do you think I need a haircut? It was originally straight, soft, and the chicks dug it, but now it always gets in my eyes even if I part it off, and it has begun curling in all directions (you&#39;d know what I was talking about if I were closer up and had a better webcam) and is greasy (I take a shower everyday). I&#39;ve got a cyber security and computer help desk competition coming up that I&#39;m going to, and one of the parts of the computer help desk competition is a role play activity and it was said that I need to have my eyes visible or my hair cut so I don&#39;t lose points (eye contact is important apparently).

So with that being said, haircut - Yes or no?
I&#39;m too indecisive to decide for myself  :|</description>

<p>i have the same problem you do. it got all wavy on top and curled, and it used to be curly and softer. so i cut it up to mid forehead and letting it grow back out.</p>
<p>so yea, get a haircut, and train it so when it grows back it’s better.[/quote]</p>
