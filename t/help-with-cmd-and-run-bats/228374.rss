<p>Your so funny.</p>
<p>First you need JDK installed if compiling <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a> if you already have that installed check the location of where it is installed the latest jdk should be like this C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_07, if that is correct go into your .bat or compiler and check that it is pointing to the right directory for the java.</p>
<p>IF EXIST “%programfiles%\JAVA\JDK1.6.0_07\BIN” (GOTO COM05)</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
