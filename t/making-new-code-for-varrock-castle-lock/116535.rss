    <title>Making New Code For Varrock Castle Lock</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-new-code-for-varrock-castle-lock/116535</link>
    <description>Ok well i Have locked varrock castle with all these Holy Forces! and I have made it so people have to use a key on the holy force to enter!! I am wanting to make a command that will let me and other administrators give players the key and inform them of what it is!! I have added a save in more info (rplayer=) and am wondering how to use that in this code. The code i came up with was this [code]else if (command.startsWith(&quot;rplayer&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3) {
String name = command.substring(8);
client c = (client) PlayerHandler.players[PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(name)];
c.addItem(744,1);
c.sendMessage(+playerName+&quot; thinks you are a good and loyal player&quot;);
c.sendMessage(&quot;of Noonescape so you have been leveled to a Rep Player.&quot;);
c.sendMessage(&quot;This means you have access to the Rep castle using the&quot;);
c.sendMessage(&quot;Heart you have in your inventory. Use the heart on any&quot;);
c.sendMessage(&quot;Of the doors and it will let you in. Please type ::agree&quot;);
c.sendMessage(&quot;to agree or ::disagree to disagree for Being Rep.&quot;);
c.sendMessage(&quot;Sincerely, &quot;+playerName);
sendMessage(&quot;Player has been informed&quot;);
c.Rplayer = 1;
c.updateRequired = true;
c.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}[/code] It doesnt work for some reason it wont compile can someone please take the code and check what is wrong with it. There is also another code i want them to agree or disagree by doing ::agree or ::disagree for the agree code i came up with this [code]if (command.equalsignorcase(&quot;Agree&quot;)) {
if (Rplayer == 1) {
		sendMessage(&quot;Thankyou for agreeing. You can now enter&quot;);
		sendMessage(&quot;The Rep Castle....&quot;);
Rplayer = 2
if (Rplayer == 0) {
sendMessage(&quot;Hey! You have to be contacted first&quot;);
if (Rplayer == 2) {
sendMessage(&quot;You have already agreeded&quot;);
if (Rplayer == 2) {
sendMessage(&quot;You cant agree once you have disagreed&quot;);
}[/code] In otherwords meaning 
0 = Havent Contacted
1 = Pending
2 = Agreed
3 - Disagreed

that code doesnt work either for some reason neither does my disagree code which is pretty much the same
[code]if (command.equalsignorcase(&quot;DisAgree&quot;)) {
if (Rplayer == 1) {
		sendMessage(&quot;What??? You disagreed? Ok fine&quot;);
		sendMessage(&quot;and no you dont get to keep the key&quot;);
		deleteItem(733, GetItemSlot(733), 1);
Rplayer = 2
if (Rplayer == 0) {
sendMessage(&quot;You havent been contacted&quot;);
if (Rplayer == 2) {
sendMessage(&quot;You cant disagree once you have agreed&quot;);
sendMessage(&quot;contact mjstar to cancel being an Rplayer&quot;);
if (Rplayer == 3) {
sendMessage(&quot;We have already recieved your disagree&quot;);
}
[/code] Anyone that has any ideas please post!!</description>
