              <p>download the source, make sure you have JRE unless you want to develop also than get JDK long with it. Inside the server folder you will see atleast 2 .bat files. 1 will be to run the server and the other will be to compile. I think run.bat is pretty much explained. Compile is to “compile” your work so you can see the changes you have made next time you run it.</p>
<p>Make sure the ip address is set to yours and you have port forwarded correctly(not getting into all of that) than hit run.bat. Open your client and have fun.<br>
When connecting to yourself use the ip 127.0.0.1<br>
