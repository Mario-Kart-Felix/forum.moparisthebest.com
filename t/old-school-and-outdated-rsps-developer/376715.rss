    <title>Old school and outdated RSPS developer!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/old-school-and-outdated-rsps-developer/376715</link>
    <description>Hello everyone. :)
On September of 2006 I first took my steps in RSPS, and I was a hoster and coder for servers and clients back in the day.
Cheezscape and Testscape were the community&#39;s favourite server sources, and later on Silabsoft released her Webclient which was very useful to us.

Now everything is new and the sources are not created in the same way any more and I&#39;ve lost myself on how things work now, I have no clue how the new development source structure works (Back in the day it was centred in Client.java ) but I do know they work in coalition with Eclipse IDE which I am familiar with.

I&#39;m old school on RSPS but I am not up-to-date on the new server/client releases so I do need some directions on all the new material, so if anyone out here could give me some pointers I would be very grateful.




Thank you very much.</description>

<p>Bases like Delta, still revolve around client.java and what not. But delta is unstable 99% of the time due too bad programming. I think a moderator by the name of Deathchaos9 is developing a delta, and he is doing an AMAZING job.</p>
<p>Project Insanity is a pretty good base, better networking than delta, and it’s packaged. Never tried PI.</p>
<p>Hyperion is probably one of the most stable server bases out there, but I’ve heard it gets some getting used too. I’ve never tried Hyperion before though. Ask Canownueasy about hyperion. He is l33t with that. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
