    <title>Java problem Please Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-problem-please-help/257521</link>
    <description>This is my problem, no I didn&#39;t search don&#39;t flame me, if there is an answer through search just give me the link.

This is what it said when i tried playing RSC Stake

Now when I went to run.bat i get
[code]&#39;java&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. press any key to continue . . . [/code]-

when i go to RSCD.jar i get

[code]Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute from
where I tried loading it from C:blah blah (where I had it)[/code]

My run.bat is setup as the following
[code]@echo off
java -classpath rscd.jar;lib/xpp3.jar;lib/xstream.jar;lib/hex-string.jar;lib/mail.jar;lib/activation.jar;lib/jmf.jar org.rscdaemon.client.mudclient
pause[/code]

I have JDK, Java, Apache ant, Wampserver.
It was working before, but now it isn&#39;t for some reason, IDK why, if there&#39;s any information I&#39;m missing that would help solve this, please ask away and i&#39;ll give.

It&#39;s not just the client, same things happen on a diff private server. 
It has to be a problem with my Java but IDK what it could be.

Would it be better to delete all my Java and just reinstall Java?? I have no clue what to do, please help, I really want to get back into playing the servers I like.

Thanks :)
