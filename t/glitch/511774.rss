    <description>I thought I fixed this but I guess I didn&#39;t...
I have SOOOOO many questions about shops...
Okay, In my PKP shop I would check hm something costs and it would show the PRICE of the item in GP
but it&#39;s in a PKP shop. So I&#39;d spawn gp and try and buy but it says I don&#39;t have enough Tokkul. Wtf..? And I just type in ::shop 31 too see the shop. I don&#39;t even know where the god damn NPC is that hosts that shop... Next, I have an NPC I made for A PK shop.. he&#39;s not in my shops.cfg but whenever I click on him it shows in the game screen hm pkp i have... along with Duradel.. I trade with him and it shows info on how much Slayer Points I have. Duradel&#39;s not in shops.cfg either... So if he isn&#39;t in shops.cfg how would I add him in there and add items into the shop .. along with my PKP NPC and his items I want in there. My shops are so fucked up. Someone show me or tell me what to do.. this is so stressful..</description>

You need to add the items to the special price area…<br>

Where’s that at?[/quote]<br>
Not in the shop handler or anything.</p>
