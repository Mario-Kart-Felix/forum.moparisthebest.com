    <title>A poll on stealing/raiding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-poll-on-stealing-raiding/399393</link>
    <description>All the time i see people in distress because a person or group of people have entered their home and stolen from all of their chests whether they are hidden or not. And tbh i can feel their pain.

I am simply asking peoples&#39; opinions on if they prefer stealing and raiding or not.</description>

I vote for infinite chest protection. Honestly I just find it more fun to kill people.<br>
Maybe we should a seperate server for this, or maybe like an ingame ‘minigame’ kinda thing.<br>
Like you spawn in a 100x300 area, each side has 100x100 and infinite materials to build a castle (no obsidian, no bedrock). After 15 minutes, you just duke it out for 10. No real winners, just pure pvp.<br>
Plus, with pistons coming, tnt cannons will be easier then ever.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Hate to burst your bubble but the current preview for pistons doesnt show it having power to launch a block, only to move it[/quote]<br>
It’s still possible to do like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> T_______Z
|        |
|        |
|        |
XY_______|</code></pre>
<p>Where:<br>
T = TNT<br>
Z = Piston<br>
X = Pressure plate<br>
Y = Door</p>
<p>Except you would have to account for the time the TNT block will need to actually explode, so the pressure plate will have to be a bit farther away than the place the TNT block will actually drop on (wire it using redstone obviously).</p>
<p>OT: I like raiding, it’s an aspect of the game just like building is. Some others don’t like being raided though, so I support the plugin mitb posted about.</p>

Maybe we should a seperate server for this, or maybe like an ingame ‘minigame’ kinda thing.<br>
Like you spawn in a 100x300 area, each side has 100x100 and infinite materials to build a castle (no obsidian, no bedrock). After 15 minutes, you just duke it out for 10. No real winners, just pure pvp.<br>

<p>like make it where if u want to raid then u can be raided but if u want to be peaceful and dont want to raid then it would be against the rules if someone steals or raids from u.</p>
<p>so in short with out a mod i suggest, having a sticked thread that lists all ppl that want to raid(by saying u want to raid that gives others permission to raid u), and ppl that want to be peaceful and just build(meaning if they raid or steal, they are breaking the rules and should be punished).</p>
<p>ppl on the peaceful list are protected by the rules and if someone steals/raids them then the stealer(s)/raider(s) get some kind of punishment.</p>
<p>if u get raided or someone steals from u and u dont have posts marking ur property then its ur fault and raids dont get punished(how are they suppose to know whos house it is).</p>
<p>if u werent aware of this new rule and raid someone that is peaceful then u still get punished but maybe not as bad as someone who knows and breaks it.</p>
<p>to me that seems fair.[/quote]</p>
<p>That would cause alot of problems, an easier solution, if you want things to be like how you said, in my eyes is have a command that can set your status to peaceful or ambitious, setting this command would give you a day or 2 pending time so people cant change their status on a dime.</p>
<p>With that in place, ambitious people wont be able to open peaceful peoples’ chests, that way you wont need to put up signs or anything, they will just know by being able to open your chest or not.</p>
<p>As for pvp goes, i currently dont have an idea of how it would work with my other idea.</p>
<p>Edit: When you vote in the poll, it would be nice if you replied with your opinion and a point as to why or why not.</p>
