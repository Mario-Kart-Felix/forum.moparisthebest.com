    <title>Buying is wrong</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buying-is-wrong/369955</link>
    <description>Hey guys, Well who ever coded my source is an idiot. here&#39;s what happens.
Buy1 = Buy 2
Buy5 = Buy 10
Buy 10 = Buy 50

How do I fix this so that when my players want to buy for example 1 Dragon Full helm, they don&#39;t waste 18m on buying 2.

Thanks.</description>
