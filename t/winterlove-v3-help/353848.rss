    <title>Winterlove V3 Help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/winterlove-v3-help/353848</link>
    <description>ok, so i just downloaded Winterlove V3 Source to edit from here:

http://www.google.org/runescape-development/google/downloads/238877-winterlove-v3-original-wl-source.html

I extracted it and evrything, got the server running, and tried playing it on the silabsoft client.  When i log in with a character that has already been created, I get on jus fine.  But when I try logging in with a new character, I keep getting an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception:21.

It says the problem is in the client, but I can&#39;t figure out what it is...If someone could try it out and maybe tell me what the issue is, that would be great :D</description>
