[center][color=blue]Hello everyone and welcome to my guide. This guide was designed to assist brand new starters to HTML Code. We will be going from the very beggining, so if your not completetely new to HTML, the first couple of chapters will be [i]a little[/i] noobish. Well, I hope it helps![/center]

[b]Chapter 1: Introduction[/b]


   HTML, short for Hypertext Markup Language, is the predominant markup language for the creation of web pages. It provides a means to describe the structure of text-based information in a document — by denoting certain text as headings, paragraphs, lists, and so on — and to supplement that text with interactive forms, embedded images, and other objects. HTML is written in the form of labels (known as tags), surrounded by less-than (&lt;) and greater-than signs (&gt;). HTML can also describe, to some degree, the appearance and semantics of a document, and can include embedded scripting language code which can affect the behavior of web browsers and other HTML processors. Confused?


[b]Chapter 2: Format[/b]


   Alright in every html code you will ever see, there will be (1st) something like this:

[code]&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;&gt;[/code]

Okay, did you notice those, &quot;&lt;&quot;,&quot;&gt;&quot; things around it all? Well for now, we are going to refer to those &quot;thingys&quot; as &quot;alliards.&quot; These alliards are around everything that will NOT be seen on your site. They designate what is code and what isn&#39;t. And when a alliard is ending something (ex. &lt;/example&gt;) there is a &quot;/&quot; after the left alliard. This wraps up the end of that code started by: ex.

[code]&lt;example&gt;[/code]

Okay next, your going to see something like this, 

[code]&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Example&lt;/title&gt;[/code]

What that is is the &quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot; is like starting off the code. The &quot;&lt;head&gt;&quot; is basically the same. The &quot;&lt;title&gt;&quot; is what you see at the very top of your web browser in (for firefox &amp; internet explorer) that blue bar. Usually there would be something in there like: &quot;RuneScape - A online multiplayer adventure game by Jagex lmtd&quot;.

Now at the end of the code it would say this:

[code]&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;[/code]

What this does is just wraps up the whole body of the code and ends with another &quot;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;.


[b]Chapter 3: Text[/b]
   

   Okay, text. Text is what goes inside the codes. Here are some codes that manipulate text:

1. Bold Text =
[code]&lt;b&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/b&gt;[/code]

2. Skip a line down from other text =
[code]&lt;b&gt;example&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;
example
&lt;/b&gt;[/code]

3. Strong Text (makes text look &quot;buffer&quot;, so to speak) =
[code]&lt;strong&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/strong&gt;[/code]

4. Big Text =
[code]&lt;big&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/big&gt;[/code]

5. Emphasized Text =
[code]&lt;em&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/em&gt;[/code]

6. Italic Text =
[code]&lt;i&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/i&gt;[/code]

7. Small Text =
[code]&lt;small&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/small&gt;[/code]

8. Subscript Text =
[code]TEXTGOESHERE
&lt;sub&gt;
SUBSCRIPT TEXTGOESHERE
&lt;/sub&gt;[/code]

9. Superscript Text =
[code]TEXTGOESHERE
&lt;sup&gt;
SUPERSCRIPT TEXTGOESHERE
&lt;/sup&gt;[/code]

10. Center Text =
[code]&lt;center&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/center&gt;[/code]

11. New Paragraph =
[code]&lt;p&gt;text text text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;text text text&lt;/p&gt;[/code]


You will always need text if your ever coding a website. There are more text manipulating codes, but these  
 are just the basics.


[b]Chapter 4: Images[/b]


   Okay images are simple, here is a basic image code:

[code]&lt;img src=&quot;URLOFIMAGE&quot;
width=&quot;*number*&quot; height=&quot;*number*&quot;&gt;[/code]

So every basic image has the, &quot;&lt;img src=&quot;URLOFIMAGE&quot;&gt;, but not all have the, &quot;width=&quot;144&quot; height=&quot;50&quot;&gt;&quot;. What that is the size of the image on your page. So if you were typing in some text and you wanted a image in the middle of your text it would look like:

[code]text text &lt;img src=&quot;URLOFIMAGE&quot;&gt; text text[/code]

Also you can make images links, to do this use the following code:

[code]&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.YOURLINKHERE.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;URLOFIMAGE&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;WHEREITTAKESYOU&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/code]

As you can see it has the basic image coding, but it also has some stuff before it, which is link code, next chapter. ;D


[b]Chapter 5: Links[/b]

  
   Okay, Links are very simple. Here is the code for any basic word link:

[code]&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.YOURLINKHERE.com&quot;&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;/a&gt;[/code]

As you can see very simple. When you see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;, it means the code has something to do with links.


[b]Chapter 6: Fonts[/b]


   Okay, Fonts are also easy. Here is a basic font code:

[code]&lt;font size=&quot;YOURSIZEHERE&quot; face=&quot;YOURFONTHERE&quot;&gt;
YOURTEXTHERE
&lt;/font&gt;[/code]

   Now here is a table of basic font attributes (or size, font and color codes), (note that they are all examples):

[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t217/b1ur67890/fontattributetable.jpg[/img]

Okay, to use the font code here is how it would read:

[code]&lt;font size=&quot;YOURSIZEHERE&quot; face=&quot;YOURFONTHERE&quot;&gt;
YOURTEXTHERE&gt;text text text text&lt;/font&gt;[/code]


[b]Chapter 7: Basic Backrounds[/b]


   Okay Backrounds are insanely easy! All you have to do is go to the top of your code, where it says, &quot;&lt;body&gt;.&quot; Now replace &quot;&lt;body&gt;&quot; with this:

[code]&lt;body background=&quot;BACKROUND URL&quot;&gt;[/code]

No worries, if the backround image isn&#39;t big enough to fill the page, it will repeat itself, untill it fills it.

I personally suggest pretty solid backround, so it makes text easy to read.


[b]Chapter 8: Forms[/b]


   Heres an example of a basic form:

[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t217/b1ur67890/basicform.jpg[/img]

Okay, here is the code of that form:

[code]&lt;form action=&quot;&quot;&gt;
First name: 
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;firstname&quot;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Last name: 
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;lastname&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;[/code]

It is simple really, just replace &quot;First name:&quot; with what you want and same for Last name. Same thing for &quot;firstname&quot; and &quot;lastname&quot;.

Okay you now when you see a form, with username and password? And you know how for the password form, whatever you type is these things: *. Here the code to do that:

[code]&lt;form action=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Username: 
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;user&quot;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Password: 
&lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;[/code]

Thats basically it for forms! ;D


[b]Chapter 9: Fonts[/b]


   Okay this is unrealistically easy. To change the font of text, you wrap the following code around it;

[code]&lt;font size=&quot;SIZENUMBER&quot; face=&quot;EXAMPLE: Times&quot;&gt;
TEXTGOESHERE
&lt;/font&gt;[/code]

Thats it. Font size is where you put the number of your font size, and face is where you put the font. Usually you just use the first word of the font name.


[b]Chapter 10: Buttons[/b]


   Okay basically what buttons are, are images that look like a button that is also a link. So what you need to do is make a image with photoshop preferably, and make it look like a button. So use that image for a code like this:

[code]&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.YOURLINKHERE.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;URLOFBUTTON IMAGE&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;WHEREITTAKESYOU&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/code]


[b]Chapter 11: Closing/Quiz/FAQ&#39;s[/b]


   Well everyone, I hope this guide helped assist you with HTML. Now again (lol) if you alredy know HTML, this guide was noobish as all hell. But if you were a HTML starter, it was probably an answered  
prayer ;D. This guide was strictly made to educate people in the ways of HTML code so they can code their own webpages/sites. Thank you very much to read my guide and I hope it helped. 


[b]Sincerely,[/b]
[i]e0n™[/i]

Is incorrect. You have to close the head tag before the body tag, and have the title tag embedded in the head tags ex:

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chapter 1: Introduction</span></p>
<p>HTML, short for Hypertext Markup Language, is the predominant markup language for the creation of web pages. It provides a means to describe the structure of text-based information in a document — by denoting certain text as headings, paragraphs, lists, and so on — and to supplement that text with interactive forms, embedded images, and other objects. HTML is written in the form of labels (known as tags), surrounded by less-than (&lt;) and greater-than signs (&gt;). HTML can also describe, to some degree, the appearance and semantics of a document, and can include embedded scripting language code which can affect the behavior of web browsers and other HTML processors. Confused?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chapter 2: Format</span></p>
<p>Alright in every html code you will ever see, there will be (1st) something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.example.com"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Okay, did you notice those, “&lt;”,"&gt;" things around it all? Well for now, we are going to refer to those “thingys” as “alliards.” These alliards are around everything that will NOT be seen on your site. They designate what is code and what isn’t. And when a alliard is ending something (ex. ) there is a “/” after the left alliard. This wraps up the end of that code started by: ex.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;example&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Okay next, your going to see something like this,</p>
<p>[code]</p>


Example[/code]
<p>What that is is the “” is like starting off the code. The “” is basically the same. The “” is what you see at the very top of your web browser in (for firefox &amp; internet explorer) that blue bar. Usually there would be something in there like: “RuneScape - A online multiplayer adventure game by Jagex lmtd”.</p>
<p>Now at the end of the code it would say this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>What this does is just wraps up the whole body of the code and ends with another “”.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chapter 3: Text</span></p>
<p>Okay, text. Text is what goes inside the codes. Here are some codes that manipulate text:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bold Text =</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;b&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/b&gt;</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Skip a line down from other text =</li>
</ol>
<p>[code]<b>example</b></p>
<br>
<b>
example
</b>[/code]
<ol start="3">
<li>Strong Text (makes text look “buffer”, so to speak) =</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;strong&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/strong&gt;</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Big Text =</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;big&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/big&gt;</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Emphasized Text =</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;em&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/em&gt;</code></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>Italic Text =</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;i&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>Small Text =</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;small&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/small&gt;</code></pre>
<ol start="8">
<li>Subscript Text =</li>
</ol>
<p><code>TEXTGOESHERE
&lt;sub&gt;
SUBSCRIPT TEXTGOESHERE
&lt;/sub&gt;</code></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Superscript Text =</li>
</ol>
<p><code>TEXTGOESHERE
&lt;sup&gt;
SUPERSCRIPT TEXTGOESHERE
&lt;/sup&gt;</code></p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Center Text =</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;center&gt;TEXTGOESHERE&lt;/center&gt;</code></pre>
<ol start="11">
<li>New Paragraph =</li>
</ol>
<p>[code]</p><p>text text text</p>
<p>text text text</p>[/code]
<p>You will always need text if your ever coding a website. There are more text manipulating codes, but these<br>
are just the basics.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chapter 4: Images</span></p>
<p>Okay images are simple, here is a basic image code:</p>
<p><code>&lt;img src="URLOFIMAGE"
width="*number*" height="*number*"&gt;</code></p>
<p>So every basic image has the, "<img>, but not all have the, “width=“144” height=“50”&gt;”. What that is the size of the image on your page. So if you were typing in some text and you wanted a image in the middle of your text it would look like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">text text &lt;img src="URLOFIMAGE"&gt; text text</code></pre>
<p>Also you can make images links, to do this use the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;a href="http://www.YOURLINKHERE.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="URLOFIMAGE" border="0" alt="WHEREITTAKESYOU"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As you can see it has the basic image coding, but it also has some stuff before it, which is link code, next chapter. ;D</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chapter 5: Links</span></p>
<p>Okay, Links are very simple. Here is the code for any basic word link:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;a href="http://www.YOURLINKHERE.com"&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As you can see very simple. When you see “&lt;a href=”, it means the code has something to do with links.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chapter 6: Fonts</span></p>
<p>Okay, Fonts are also easy. Here is a basic font code:</p>
<p><code>&lt;font size="YOURSIZEHERE" face="YOURFONTHERE"&gt;
YOURTEXTHERE
&lt;/font&gt;</code></p>
<p>Now here is a table of basic font attributes (or size, font and color codes), (note that they are all examples):</p>
<p><img src="http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t217/b1ur67890/fontattributetable.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Okay, to use the font code here is how it would read:</p>
<p><code>&lt;font size="YOURSIZEHERE" face="YOURFONTHERE"&gt;
YOURTEXTHERE&gt;text text text text&lt;/font&gt;</code></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chapter 7: Basic Backrounds</span></p>
<p>Okay Backrounds are insanely easy! All you have to do is go to the top of your code, where it says, “.” Now replace “” with this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;body background="BACKROUND URL"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>No worries, if the backround image isn’t big enough to fill the page, it will repeat itself, untill it fills it.</p>
<p>I personally suggest pretty solid backround, so it makes text easy to read.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chapter 8: Forms</span></p>
<p>Heres an example of a basic form:</p>
<p><img src="http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t217/b1ur67890/basicform.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Okay, here is the code of that form:</p>
<p>[code]<br>
First name:<br>
<br>
<br><br>
Last name:<br>
</p>
[/code]
<p>It is simple really, just replace “First name:” with what you want and same for Last name. Same thing for “firstname” and “lastname”.</p>
<p>Okay you now when you see a form, with username and password? And you know how for the password form, whatever you type is these things: *. Here the code to do that:</p>
<p>[code]<br>
Username:<br>
<br>
<br><br>
Password:<br>
</p>
[/code]
<p>Thats basically it for forms! ;D</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chapter 9: Fonts</span></p>
<p>Okay this is unrealistically easy. To change the font of text, you wrap the following code around it;</p>
<p><code>&lt;font size="SIZENUMBER" face="EXAMPLE: Times"&gt;
TEXTGOESHERE
&lt;/font&gt;</code></p>
<p>Thats it. Font size is where you put the number of your font size, and face is where you put the font. Usually you just use the first word of the font name.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chapter 10: Buttons</span></p>
<p>Okay basically what buttons are, are images that look like a button that is also a link. So what you need to do is make a image with photoshop preferably, and make it look like a button. So use that image for a code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;a href="http://www.YOURLINKHERE.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="URLOFBUTTON IMAGE" border="0" alt="WHEREITTAKESYOU"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chapter 11: Closing/Quiz/FAQ’s</span></p>
