    <description>I use a Project Insanity base.

This is a simple question, yes I know, but I can&#39;t seem to find where I modify the actions of [code]c.getPA().startTeleport[/code]

You would think it would be in client.java, obviously because it has the c.getPA and c is defined as a shortcut for the client class, but I couldn&#39;t find it in client.java. Lol.

Base: [Project Insanity] Insanity-X

What I&#39;m Asking: Where can I modify the actions of c.getPA().startTeleport? I know what to do from there, I just need someone to point me in the right direction.

Why?: I&#39;m fixing a dupe for my server. -.- I had to remove the freaking ::train teleport command because of dupers. (Btw if you ever get dupers go to PM logs and search for files containing the text &quot;dupe&quot; Busted like 10-15 dupers. lol)

My Research: I&#39;ve looked for fixes for this dupe, I couldn&#39;t find any so I just decided to do it myself, but then I realized I couldn&#39;t find where to modify c.getPA().startTeleport...Lol. So yeah, I have done my research, I just couldn&#39;t find anything. I have also tried doing this myself, so please don&#39;t think I&#39;m asking for someone to do all my work for me.


Thank you!
