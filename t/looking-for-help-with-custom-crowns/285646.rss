    <title>Looking for help with custom crowns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-help-with-custom-crowns/285646</link>
    <description>ok so. i followed galkons tutorial. it worked perfect. however now im looking to add 2-3 EXTRA crowns at rights level 3-5 now i read a tutorial like this and it ALMOST worked. rights level 4 and 5 displace the name but dont show a crown and rights level 3 delays but after 4 messagees shows up but instantly gives an out of bounds exception that i dont know what the cause is. any help would be appretiated and if you need more information i can provide it for you.
edit: with some fiddling i can get rights level 3 to just delay 3 messages before showing a delayed crown......
edit: im glad 14 people have looked at this so far and not one of them decided to post anything.</description>
