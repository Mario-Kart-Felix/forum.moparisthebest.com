    <title>Should I Do It? Post A Thread On RS Forums REALLY Educating Them?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-i-do-it-post-a-thread-on-rs-forums-really-educating-them/134178</link>
    <description>Hey,

     I really can&#39;t stand all these little uneducated faggots talking shit about Mopar. Personally, I think that MoparScape is completely useless unless soemone wants to make rs movies. But, I really can&#39;t take it anymore.. I want to post a thread on the rs forums, educating them all. I want to do it without getting banned, and I think I know how. No one ever got banned for asking a question =) I&#39;m thinking of posting something along the lines of this to keep from the ban stick.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hey,

     I was just wondering something... People say that Moparscape is illegal, and that it has keyloggers and such, but I&#39;ve never seen anyone sued or hacked from it... Personally, I&#39;ve never downloaded it, simply because it sounds like it&#39;s useless unless I was making a RuneScape movie.. But, I&#39;ve wondered for a while why Jagex hasn&#39;t sued them, or people hacked by them haven&#39;t come forward. Really doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Please post your opinions.

Thanks,
Buzzy&lt;/blockquote&gt;

     I don&#39;t know what board to post it in, so if someone could help with that, it&#39;d be cool. Anyways, think I should do it, might make one of the less close-minded idiots realize it&#39;s all lies... Anyways..

Thanks,
Buzzy</description>

<p>You are retarted. For one, you cant blame people if they dont use grammer. Such as you being and idiotic nerd that always follows the rules. I am using grammer as it is stated in the rules. But you my <span class="bbcode-b">[size=6pt]very[/size]</span> fat friend. You follow all the rules, so please dont critize him. Maybe this colour will appeal to your large eyes.</p>

              <p>Hey,</p>
<pre><code> I really can't stand all these little uneducated faggots talking shit about Mopar. Personally, I think that MoparScape is completely useless unless soemone wants to make rs movies. But, I really can't take it anymore.. I want to post a thread on the rs forums, educating them all. I want to do it without getting banned, and I think I know how. No one ever got banned for asking a question =) I'm thinking of posting something along the lines of this to keep from the ban stick.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>Hey,
<pre><code> I was just wondering something... People say that Moparscape is illegal, and that it has keyloggers and such, but I've never seen anyone sued or hacked from it... Personally, I've never downloaded it, simply because it sounds like it's useless unless I was making a RuneScape movie.. But, I've wondered for a while why Jagex hasn't sued them, or people hacked by them haven't come forward. Really doesn't make sense to me. Please post your opinions.
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Buzzy</p>

<pre><code> I don't know what board to post it in, so if someone could help with that, it'd be cool. Anyways, think I should do it, might make one of the less close-minded idiots realize it's all lies... Anyways..
