    <title>Runescape - Changing passwords</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-changing-passwords/451681</link>
    <description>My friend has recently quit runescape and give me his account. 

So, I went to the page that allows you to change your password and realized I needed the email and password to that email so I could change the password. So, I asked my friend and he said he had forgotten the password. Is there anyway I can change the password now? 

Sorry if it doesn&#39;t really sound clear, but I would really appreciate some help.

Thanks!</description>
