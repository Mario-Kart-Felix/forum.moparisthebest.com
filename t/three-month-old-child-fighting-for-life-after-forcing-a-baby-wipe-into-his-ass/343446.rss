    <description>Yes, don&#39;t be mistaken it&#39;s pretty much as horrible as it sounds. 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/10285707.stm

&lt;blockquote&gt;A man who left a three-month-old child fighting for life after forcing a baby wipe into his bottom to prevent a dirty nappy has been admonished.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Usually when I hear cases of rape and stuff I can sort of see it from a pedophiles point of view, obviously finding young girls attractive. But this time I can&#39;t actually comprehend what the fuck this guy was thinking.</description>

<p>Yes, he said he did it to keep the diaper clean, that he didn’t know it would harm the child.  Seems like a lie to me though.[/quote]“When McArthur was questioned by police about the injuries they found him to be somewhat vague and evasive.”</p>
<p>Obviously there’s a lot more to it than we’re reading. He could have been working from home and the baby kept crapping, so he shoved it up there in a rage and then realised that he did something retarded so tried to remove it in haste: “The next day in a bid to remove the wipe using his fingers, McArthur caused significant internal injuries, including a perforated bowel.”</p>
