    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-port-forwarding/293782</link>
    <description>ive been testing my server on my own for a while, and it works fine localhost, but i cant even get my other computer on network to connect, also no one can view my httpd, and i have a domain connected to it (http://www.fsclassic.net) should be my computer, but it doesnt load for anyone but the person on the computer.  i thought i had it port forwarded correctly but i suppose i did it wrong, can someone explain this to me.?</description>
