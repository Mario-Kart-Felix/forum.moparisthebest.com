              <p>Don’t know, but find your ip address by using ipconfig with command prompt (Default Gateway) then put it into your address bar in a browser, then if it asks you for a password then it’s usually something like:<br>
admin<br>
password<br>
admin<br>
pass<br>
admin<br>
123</p>
<p>Or something like that… or contact the service with customer support and then ask them… thats the last resort if you really want a server without hamachi…</p>
<p>Good luck… :(, I have a warning now, for double posting… does it go away? or no?</p>
