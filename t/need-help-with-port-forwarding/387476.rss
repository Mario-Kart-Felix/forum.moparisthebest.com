    <description>I just cant get this ive been trying to get my friend to connect to my server for days now.
I put the client on megaupload he downloads it and says &quot;error connecting to server&quot; when he trys to connect.
Ive gona through tons of guides, it seems like i have all the portforwarding done right and i have no-ip and all that
but i cant seem to get people to connect, is there any info i can put out to get help or have some1 else try to connect to my
server?</description>
