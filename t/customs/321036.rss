    <description> :confused:
I was tought to add customs into the models folder, then put the ints into class 8.
I downloaded the Games Pvp source and the owner lost his client, so he said use bluurs.
He gave the link to his models, and i downloaded them. they&#39;re all ****.dat files.
No ints.... How do i add it to bluurs client? Was he just being stupid ?
Do i rly need ints lol?</description>

<p>YES, you do need ints, it doesn’t matter if you downloaded just the model. You need the ints. you don’t even need to download the model. You mostly only need the ints.</p>
