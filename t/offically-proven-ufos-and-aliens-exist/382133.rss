    <description>Remember a few months ago in a debate someone wrote aliens will come in 6 months.. well they finally came.

Here is the proof

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0lEqR1Oy3I

Here is a close up video.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY2FFEufsuY

It can&#39;t be fake is also another video on youtube someone made where a government site takes snapshots of the city every 10 minutes and the footage was erased to cover it up but you can still see a frame where you can see the UFO on top of the chapel but I forgot the link you guys will have to find it.</description>

The thing you guys don’t seem to consider is that – if there are any other sentient beings – odds are they are WAY further along than us (the human race is EXTREMELY young compared to the age of the universe).<br>
and if you follow a philosophical belief: the more advanced they are, the more peaceful they are; if they are an aggressive race and they knew of our existence, they probably would have killed us by now.</p>

<p>That’s an interesting poster, but what it says and what you said aren’t true.  Well, they could be, but they don’t have to be.</p>
<p>For example, why does a civilization have to be technologically advanced or be around thousands of years for interstellar space travel?  What’s to say that they won’t have even developed the power of speech but still are able to travel to and around our planet just because they somehow don’t experience space and distance the way we do?  Maybe they exist in some alternate dimension where 1ft = 100,000,000,000,000 light years in our dimension, and they can pop in between the different dimensions when ever they want?</p>
<p>Also, what’s to say 'alien’s aren’t already here?  We have been on this planet for a long time, and have no idea what exists at the bottom of the oceans or more than a few miles under the surface of the earth.  Why then, would it not be possible that intelligent life that has been around as long as us exists at depths of the oceans we can’t get to, or miles under the surface of the planet?</p>
<p>Basically the possibilities are endless, and we can speculate as much as we want, but the fact is we have no idea whatsoever.[/quote]</p>
<p>Eh, I would say probabilities point to the aforementioned, but that is merely my opinion.<br>
I prefer to not think about dimensional theories, as it would be a complete mind-fuck, but I do agree that it is quite possible.  Other factors that we take for granted could also very well not even exist in this ‘alien race’, such as their shape, size, body parts, etc.   We judge if something exists or not from our sensory perceptions of that object, but what if they do not exist in the realms that we perceive? i.e. metaphysical beings</p>

<p>Again, he said aliens. Therefore the UFO refers to a spaceship, so you’re still being pedantic?</p>

<p>Depends on things like gravity and the size of the planet. Seems a pretty obscure statement to make since I would have thought it pretty obvious considering microbes, and the fact that life on Earth is all different shapes and sizes.</p>

It’s pure pulp science-fiction to think that an super-intelligent alien race has the capabilities of reaching our planet undetected, and then have to hover a few meters above a chapel to collect data. If they want to collect information about us, they surely are capable to tune in to our satellite system and gather everything they want, from a safe distance.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>they are gathering holy data / energy from the praying people at the chapel they are gathering different type of resource, aka mind energy or human energy. Since alot of humans come to that wall to pray.[/quote]</p>
<p>I think we can safely say that this guy isn’t worth arguing with.</p>

<p>I never said they are monitoring us, you did. Intelligence is potentially limitless, but no matter what any species which thrives and outgrows it’s home planet would have to move to another and since most aren’t habitable, they’d more than likely live on huge spacecraft and travel to and fro, harvesting resources from whatever planets they can reach. All in the name of just surviving (since the universe has no ultimate rewards or goals unless you’re religious).</p>
<blockquote>So they got spacecrafts does that make flies or birds intelligent just because they got wings and can fly.. okay bad example they engineered spacecrafts! they can use TOOLS they are smart!!.</blockquote> Intelligence in humans led to technology, there's no saying it wouldn't be the same everywhere. The only alternative is supernatural (scifi) shit which we have no evidence of.
<blockquote>You can make a person smart if he has any type of ability you don't understand like mind control etc? or it's just a super power?</blockquote> Not sure what this is relevant to, but as I said above. No evidence this can happen.

              <p>Greeny I totally understand your point of making me into a conspiracy freak… But really there is only 3 options you can do…</p>
<p>Hate on government and thinking they are always covering things up sure its close minded but in a way if everyone thinks like this and not support the government sooner or later the govn’t has no choose but to stop doing this secretive shit and let the people of IT’s nation know the truth.</p>
<p>Or you can of course balance the too… maybe the government is telling the truth it was just a weather balloon… or you see something extraordinary and no matter what bad news you hear to cover something up you will still believe in your mind it’s the real deal thats what I mean in balancing the two… but in this case you will still believe in the government and nothing will change.</p>
<p>Or of course you can be a puppet and believe EVERYTHING the government tell you… you got the option to be any of those 3… really no progress can be made doing the last 2…</p>
<p>IDK what to write to you… I’ll think of something later atm I gotta go do the dishes.</p>
<p>You cannot master intelligence if they did… they wouldn’t check on us… mastering intelligence gives you a safety net on your mind and you wouldn’t ever look for anything else since you got all the intelligence amirite?</p>
<p>So they got spacecrafts does that make flies or birds intelligent just because they got wings and can fly… okay bad example they engineered spacecrafts! they can use TOOLS they are smart!!.</p>
<p>You can make a person smart if he has any type of ability you don’t understand like mind control etc? or it’s just a super power?</p>
<p>Sure you will start to talk about curiosity about aliens but why</p>

Wrong. Just wrong. As with all of your understanding of physics and the laws of nature.

You can't know this, any race that has mastered prolonging life (not difficult really, since we nearly have) could have achieved this millions of years ago and would therefore be an unstoppable force. On the contrary, that race could be humans if we ever get off this rock.
<p>I’m going to stop quoting here because I can’t tell what a lot of you said is supposed to mean, for all I know you’re just trolling.</p>
<p>Baring in mind I’m the one here who people usually tell to lay off the weed for my extravagant ideas. There’s a difference between the government persuading some of the people most of the time, and “brainwashing”. You’re actually the opposite of what you think you are. You don’t think freely, or believe the government. Instead you believe conspiracy theories. That’s just as bad as believing the government.</p>
<p>I think for myself, as do quite a few of the people here. You’re just another idiot who thinks he thinks for himself and is actually just regurgitating conspiracy after conspiracy. So congratulations, you just made yourself look immensely dumb.</p>

<p>they are gathering holy data / energy from the praying people at the chapel they are gathering different type of resource, aka mind energy or human energy. Since alot of humans come to that wall to pray.</p>

If they came before us, long, long before us then they’re probably living in space as Nomads, have synthetic DNA and have probably lived millions of years. Those are the scary aliens, because they’ll just charge right in and eliminate us for our resources.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Why would aliens eliminate us for our resources when there is PLENTLY billions zillions of other planets with same resources and no humans. They could use humans to advance technology in some ways they didn’t think or some new way of thinking as the possiblies of knowledge are unlimited and i’m pretty sure aliens didn’t discover everything possible just yet so they reply and monitor on humans and other lifeforms below them…</p>
<p>Of course if they see us becoming a threat they will kill us off so we won’t cause any problems. Or just they wait until we evolve to understand other lifeforms for not being violent and all live peaceful lives.</p>
<p>Aliens are very smart and understand not to be like animals… like animels first thing comes to their head is kill and eat them.</p>
<p>The argument of not hearing any soundwaves when they travel so fast does somehow not work well with our physics. But put it this way the people recording that alien event sounded extremely dumb… some of the things they say as I speak their langauge i’ll translate… include “malformed penis in your mouth” and “oh bitch piss yourself”</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure these people aren’t smart enough to use computers let alone editing software first of all. if they were professionals they would use a real good camera why the fuck do they use such bad footage from cellphones (obviously thats all they got to work with on the spot, they see some crazy shit and boot it up) and guys you never say anything about the government site that proved it… but yeah I couldn’t find it anymore if anyone found it post it.</p>
<p>Simple way to tell how much brain washed people are.</p>
<p>I don’t watch much TV so my brain been cleaning this shit up from all the brain washing i accommodated, yah maybe the government will come to my house and kill me for this way of thinking and saying the obvious but i don’t give a fuck because i’m a beast.</p>
<p>Here is a very quick and easy way to tell how much the majority of you are brain washed. Quick and simple here when a weather balloon crashed at rosewell why did the government workers from Area 51 come to clean it up the chemical spills and such all have GOVERNMENT workers cleaning them up, shouldn’t someone who knows about chemical spills would be more suited to this job.</p>
<p>When a airplane crashes did they have Area 51 personnel come to clean it up? no the fire department cleans it up. Why does Area 51 have to clean up something as simple as a WEATHER balloon.</p>
<p>Sure you will reply with they have to keep their options open maybe it really is a UFO but lets say it was or wasn’t. Why did they start taking the chunks to their facilities they should of just say AH it’s jsut a weather balloon, take this shit to the junkyard, lets get the fuck outta here, let the fire department clean it up.  But no they started packaging all the scraps and driving them to area 51, so this right here proves UFO’s exist.</p>
<p>But here you guys will reply perhaps they took the stuff to the facility because they weren’t sure if it was a UFO or a weather balloon we take it just in case cause when the farmer who discovered it say can I come to take a look they said, “NO Don’t worry about it, just a weather balloon” nice excuse why didn’t they let him come check it out if it was just a weather balloon.</p>
<p>Think about The twin towers no Area 51 government workers came there, because everyone was saying it’s a airplane and they said ah fuck it no point in going there.</p>
<p>You guys are still replying to this thread because a little part of your brain still says something is not right here, sure i’m reading these facts and saying ah it’s all bullshit but a little chuck of your brain says something about these pieces don’t add up, i think i’m getting brainwashed, even those who are here saying it’s fake you come here because a part of your brain is still skeptical. If you know how a light bulb works you never type in google “How does a lightblub work” because your brain for a fact already knows… so you have no interest in the subject but on the subject of ufos you got people here coming I don’t believe in that shit but yet they still keep coming here… it’s my light bulb theory here that a chuck of a brain that people wouldn’t come here if they weren’t interested and knew for a fact that proof that either they exist or not…</p>
<p>Thats IT GUYS I know aliens don’t exist i don’t even want to come to this topic… exactly…chill out</p>
<p>Btw guys I smoked a blunt so i might have wrote alot of shit here, but it’s good to write this shit because you won’t remember after the high goes away maybe I will read this shit and amaze myself at the shit my brain does while it’s high when my brain is on AUTOMATIC when you are high…</p>
<p>when you were young your brain was working automatic… now when you are older you gotta control it pisses me off.</p>
<p>You gotta think simple things like this, not so complex, simple thinking is why google is so rich, complex thinking is why microsoft is going out of business with their bloated software.</p>

<p>if they came after us their race might have developed intelligently a lot faster than we have, so they could still be miles better than us at space travel, and if they came before us they could still be living on their host planet or another host planet that they have gone to, and just ebcause we have resources doesnt mean they want them, and even if they did doest mean they’d kill us for them<br>
EDIT: also something accelerating that fast would cause a massive downwards force as soon as it moved even a fraction, this would cause some form of noise or have some noticeable effect, as far as i can tell it doesnt</p>

LOL, Aliens more than probably exist, but they’re along way from Earth.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why?  What’s to say they aren’t very near, even watching us?  There is no evidence one way or the other.[/quote]</p>
<p>UFO means intelligent aliens, which also means spaceship, now bare in mind we scan the sky all over for anything, even just the static. Sure they could be super stealthy, but more likely is in the vastness that is the universe they just haven’t found us. Nor us them.  Watch a recent Stephen hawking video, or just take a look at a 3D mapping of the universe and try to as hard as you can to quantify how big the universe is. I promise you, it’ll blow your mind and it’s incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p>There could be aliens under the surface of one of Jupiter’s moons, not to mention that there could even still be evidence of life on Mars. Those potential “aliens” are very near, but nowhere near intelligent on the evolutionary scale.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m an atheist and believe Aliens do exist, I just don’t believe they’re here on Earth yet. I believe millions of alien life forms exist, just because of the sheer size of our universe, the chances of some being intelligent is quite slim but not impossible. If they came after us, they can’t be much better than us at space travel. If they came before us, long, long before us then they’re probably living in space as Nomads, have synthetic DNA and have probably lived millions of years. Those are the scary aliens, because they’ll just charge right in and eliminate us for our resources.</p>
<p>The idea aliens would come to “scan” or observe is ridiculous based on the sheer distances they’d have to travel to get here. I’ll take your arguments seriously if you can at least demonstrate you at least slightly understand the distances I’m talking about. I get high all the time, and that’s why I do know a lot about this stuff, and read books on it, and sit thinking about it. A lot.</p>
<p>Besides you shouldn’t need to find amazement in imagining Aliens are in UFOs coming to Earth (until it happens). Till then just enjoy the creatures Earth has, since some are still pretty alien to us. Bottom of the ocean being the best example.</p>
<p>Fancy meeting one of these:</p>

<p>That’s a small spider crab, the largest ones are found at 2000ft under, and have never been caught. Apparently they can straddle a car (there was an interestin article on reddit).</p>

Also all the video’s were obviously recorded that same night as the timings are perfect in “Jerusalem UFO 2011! - Witness Video 4 Syncronized.flv”</p>
<p>But whatever think what you guys want to think, really who cares I just wanted to share this find.[/quote]</p>
<p>one of the videos you linked is from a guy who says its fake, so the fact theres a lot of videos doesnt say much</p>
