    <description>
[ul]For months I&#39;ve tried to host a server, but I always failed. Later, I got a new ISP, but it was just recently cancelled because of the price being outrageous. Now I&#39;m back with the same ISP (Windstream) and I&#39;ve tried to everything to try to host my server:
[list]
[li]Portforwarding[/li]

[li]Disabling Firewall (Windows and Anti-Virus)[/li]

[li]Using uTorrent[/li]
[/list]

None of these have worked so far. I know for a fact I&#39;ve used the methods the correct way they should be, because I used them on my last ISP. I&#39;m not quite sure why I can&#39;t seem to host them on this ISP. I don&#39;t want to go back to Hamachi (first networking program I ever used) and I can&#39;t afford a VPS right now because I&#39;m only 16, and my grandparents live off of Social Security and practically are my guardians. If anyone can give me an suggestions or tips to how I can fix this, please do.

Not sure if this will help, but I&#39;ve tried using a router and straight through modem. When I try to connect to the gateway via typing IP in browser, it automatically directs me to my modem&#39;s setup interface, and never to my router&#39;s. I&#39;m not exactly sure what else can be done but as stated, please post below.[/ul]</description>

              <p>Well the difference between my post and other’s, is I have experience. I have tried running the Ethernet cable straight from the modem to my computer, and it solves nothing. Also, when I do use a router, it doesn’t even go to the router’s interface, but to the modem’s.</p>

First off, I see you post more for telling people what to and what not to post more than helping anyone. Also, if they really wanted that rule to be strict and regulated properly, it should be posted in THIS section and pinned. Besides, did you even read the post? It’s not only a portforwarding problem, because I assure you I know how to portforward. This is something else.[/quote]</p>
<p>Have you [b]tried[/b\ the <a href="http://portforwarding.com" rel="nofollow noopener">portforwarding.com</a> site? It has instructions on literally every router known out there that I know.</p>
<p>On a serious note though, I did read it actually. We can’t really diagnose this problem without having more information. When you say setup interface are you referring to the online web interface that has all your routers information etc or what? Not all routers accept porting either though so that could be the situation. There are several factors that have to be added in.</p>
<p>p.s. and yes I read every post &lt;3 I just get tired of seeing literally nearly all of the same help topics and it’s time the staff actually did something about it…</p>
