    <title>RS player indexing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs-player-indexing/549216</link>
    <description>Is there a reason why RS starts counting the index of players from 1 rather than from 0?
Took me hours to find why my updating was doing weird, it was because I started counting from 0.
Which would be the logical way imo.</description>

<p>You can start at index 0 in runescape classic. From memory I think index 0 in RS2 is used to store your player information client-side (so you wouldn’t want to tell the client to update that information with someone else’s).</p>

<p>correct the clients player is set into slot 0 for certain things.</p>

<p>No idea. Perhaps it was an artifact from loading players from a database where the rows start at 1 instead of 0.</p>
