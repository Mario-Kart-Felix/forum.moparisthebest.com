    <title>Anyone willing to pay $17?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-willing-to-pay-17/248836</link>
    <description>Okay, first and foremost if you&#39;re going to call me a scab piss off.

Now, second. Does anyone have $17 spare on a paypal account, which they could lend me to buy a book. I would be willing to work for it, I just cannot buy it as we do not have a credit card which supports paypal. I have tried downloading it as an e-Book, cracked, etc, but none work, and quite frankly I would rather a hard-cover book anyway.

Now, I can work for it, meaning I could program for you until I work off my debt.</description>
