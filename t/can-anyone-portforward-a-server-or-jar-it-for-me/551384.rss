True, but I learnt how to port forward by reading one of the unlimited tutorials out there. As I’m sure most people did. The OP shouldn’t have posted such a pointless post when there are tutorials that are good enough for a baby to understand. Also the fact he mentioned Jarring his client in the server section doesn’t really help his case much either.</p>

The point was how you stated what you stated sounded exactly like you <span class="bbcode-i">were</span> bashing him.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more than tutorials out there. Also, not every tutorial covers every router.<br>
I remember when I had a netgear router some years ago. I tried and tried to portforward the thing, I followed every which guide, it wouldn’t port forward. I found this application to auto port forward (called SimplePortForwarding), and watched it run. It did literally everything I did (The program opens a browser and types the data in. it’s pretty cool). Then I ran a port check, the port was open.<br>
I don’t know what it changed, but it made it work. (Note: I no longer have that router)</p>
