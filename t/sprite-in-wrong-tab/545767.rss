    <description>One of the new prayer sprites is appearing in my ancient magic spellbook. My new prayer book loads just fine, and so do the other magic spellbooks. I have no idea where to start with this, but I know it is client sided.

The home teleport on normal spellbook works. The home teleport on ancient &amp; lunar spellbook do NOT work. I know this is server sided in clickingbuttons but I do not know what case # to give each.</description>
