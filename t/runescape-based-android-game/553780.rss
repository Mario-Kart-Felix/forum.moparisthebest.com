    <title>Runescape Based Android Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-based-android-game/553780</link>
    <description>So this is just a project I have been working on recently trying to recreate a runescape themed game for android havent found anything on the playstore that suites my needs so figured why not make my own. I know its very basic but its just a work in progress doing lots of testing atm to make sure I can proceed with everything I want to make this into.

And that’s my issue with these projects, not that they can’t learn anything out of it, but the idea that there will come any game out of this that you would spend time playing. They’re picking the wrong scope for the amount of developers on the project.</p>

<p>The difference between you and him is we live in an age where there are free engines that pale in comparison to anything you’ve ever created. This isn’t 1999.</p>
<p>To add, not using OpenGL/Dx is suicidal unless you went to school for a degree in the mathematics involved. Exceptions for this are certain nuances you NEED that both don’t provide. You haven’t yet, or are not. So get off your high horse and shut up.</p>
