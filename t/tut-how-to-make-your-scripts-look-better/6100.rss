    <description>[center][b][size=18pt]How to make your script look better? - Guide![/size][/b][/center]

Does your scripting look terrible? Want to clean it up a bit before releasing it? Want it to be easier to read? But you don&#39;t like hitting TAB and space all the time? Well then you are in the right topic! :D

Here I explain step by step how to do it!

1. First thing you need is this program called DelFor, you can download it from [url=http://www.dow.wau.nl/aew/downloads/DelFor.zip]here.[/url] It&#39;s in .rar format so you need to extract it, and that can be done with [url=http://www.rarlab.com/rar/wrar351.exe]WinRar[/url]. I suppose you know how to extract it since you know how to script :)

2. Now you should have directory called DelFor. Open it and click on Delfor.exe 

3. Now go to Format -&gt; Options

4. Go to Preview and you see two boxes, BEFORE and AFTER boxes.

5. Now just copy+paste your scriptings into BEFORE box and you see better looking scripting in AFTER box.

6. Now copy that script from AFTER box into SCAR and you are ready to go! :)

Wasn&#39;t that hard, was it? Now your friends can read your script easier to fix any bugs or etc. :)

              <p>Some people really never learn to use em. Legit… AND you can learn with that tool, too. Later some people who have used that for couple weeks (or months, even days maybee) will learn to make standards without tool(You do it many times, you get used to it quickly, trust me). At least when they are interested about it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It’s helping when there is new scripters posting their scripts with errors, as advanced scripters find the problems very quickly. So basically, why not? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Tool or without tool, doesn’t matter.</p>
