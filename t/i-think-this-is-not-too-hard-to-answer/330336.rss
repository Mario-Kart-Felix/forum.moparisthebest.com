How can i do that when u press on an NPC, it asks: &quot;Do you want to buy beer?&quot; And that when u press &quot;no&quot;, conversation gets closed, but that when u press &quot;Yes&quot;, 2 coins go away of ur inventory and u get a beer. And when u don&#39;t got enough, the NPC says: &quot;You don&#39;t have enough gold&quot; en then when u press next, conversation gets closed.

And, please give me the right code. Before this one, someone else gaved me a wrong code, and me server got f*cked up. Couldn&#39;t compile. But luckily, i could delete the codes, and me server got fine.

And if u need this: Im using 317 HomieScape!!

And please give me the CODE and don&#39;t tell that it is something with dialogues.
So can someone give me the code and tell me where i need to enter it in please?</description>

Delta is a failure of a source, first of all you want to actually call your server “work” use Dodian, or atleast reprogram your server to a new computer language such as the famous c++…</p>
<p>Homiescape can’t take rep either.<br>

<p>I was referring to the tutorial &gt;_&gt;.<br>
I know Delta sucks, but most people use it. That’s why I used it for my tutorial.</p>
<p>Also, good luck reprogramming your server to C++. It has not been done before.[/quote]</p>
