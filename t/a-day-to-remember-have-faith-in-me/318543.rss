What you think about them or this song? 

[b]Lyrics:[/b]
Have faith in me
cause there are things that i&#39;ve seen i don&#39;t believe
so cling to what you know and never let go
you should know things aren&#39;t always what they seem

i said i&#39;d never let you go, and i never did
i said i&#39;d never let you fall and i always meant it
if you didn&#39;t have this chance then i never did
you&#39;ll always find me right there, again

i&#39;ve gone crazy
cause there are things in the streets i don&#39;t believe
so we&#39;ll pretend it&#39;s alright and stay in for the night
what a world
i&#39;ll keep you safe here with me

i said i&#39;d never let you go, and i never did
i said i&#39;d never let you fall and i always meant it
if you didn&#39;t have this chance then i never did
you&#39;ll always find me right there, again

i said i&#39;d never let you go, and i never did
i said i&#39;d never let you fall and i always meant it
if you didn&#39;t have this chance then i never did
you&#39;ll always find me right there, again

they&#39;ve got me on the outside, looking in
but i can&#39;t see at all
with the weight of the world on my shoulders,
they just wanna see me fall

they&#39;ve got me on the outside, looking in
but i can&#39;t see at all
with the weight of the world on my shoulders,
they just wanna see me fall

have faith in me

i said i&#39;d never let you go, and i never did
i said i&#39;d never let you fall and i always meant it
if you didn&#39;t have this chance then i never did
you&#39;ll always find me right there, again

i said i&#39;d never let you go, and i never did
i said i&#39;d never let you fall and i always meant it
if you didn&#39;t have this chance then i never did
you&#39;ll always find me right there, again

i said i&#39;d never let you go, and i never did
i said i&#39;d never let you go, and i never did
i said i&#39;d never let you go, and i never did
i said i&#39;d never let you go, and i never did

You had me at hello
My life for hire
If it means a lot to you
The downfall of us all
Since you been gone[/center]</description>
