    <title>What ZKM does to RuneScape *for newbs*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-zkm-does-to-runescape-for-newbs/295646</link>
    <description>This thread is dedicated to the newbies who don&#39;t quite understand exactly what ZKM does to runescape :P

Ok, runescape is obfuscated with several different methods of obfuscation. ZKM only accounts for one: the one that affects control flow.

Code control flow is the path it takes through instructions until it reaches it end. To visit a chunk of code that&#39;s not immediately after it, branch instructions were created. For example, a for loop; after the loop code it has to go back to checking the loop condition, and if it is still met, it&#39;ll rejump to the start of the code. The first jump is a unconditional jump; it jumps directly without a condition. The second is a conditional jump, it only jumps under a condition (in this case, the loop condition). Conditions are predicates, or evaluate to truth values.

What ZKM&#39;s flow obfuscator does is go through and find unconditional branches, and give them a condition. The condition is opaque, or has a set, constant truth value when evaluated. Source-code level constructs like a for loop will always use an unconditional branch, but when ZKM goes through and obstructs the flow, the decompiler can&#39;t tell what it was because random jumps now have conditions. ZKM also adds these branches to random places within code with conditions that will always evaluate to being false due to how the code works. To construct these predicates, ZKM creates int or boolean fields that I term flow obstructors. These fields are used to build the constant evaluated value conditions, or opaque predicates, which ZKM compares to zero.

Any range of obstructors could be present in an obfuscated application, and you can find them by checking methods for code that does something similar to:
[code]
obstructor1 = ++obstructor2;
[/code]

So, to fix the control flow, we must remove constantly-false conditioned branches, and turn constantly-true conditioned branches into unconditional branches.

Note, I don&#39;t think this was very in-depth at all, butt I know from first-hand experience what it feels like to wonder what ZKM actually does, and how we reverse it. Feel free to critique! And hopefully newbs will learn a thing or two :)</description>

<p>Yep, as a rule of thumb: the branches with the condition obstructor == 0 -&gt; unconditional branch. the branches with condition obstructor != 0 -&gt; remove.</p>
