<p>Why so? Not looking to run anything important on them. I don’t want to run a whole datacenter at my house I just want like 1 server.[/quote]Just internal stuff? Then I guess it’d be ok. But if you run a RSPS or anything external I’d say it’s a bad idea, because if someone tries to hit your server offline for whatever reason, you’d be hit offline completely.</p>

just build a comp with good enough specs for what you intend to serve on it. DMZ it and run it 24/7 and you’re done.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You can get desktops dirt cheap second hand etc. Some people give them away for free like I have a computer sitting in my room which is completely outdated but still has half decent specs.<br>
I’d just buy a second hand vps of ebay as there cheap and there aimed at hosting, consideration is taken into how a vps is made as when its made they know its going to be on near enough 24/7.<br>
Computers aren’t meant for that although mines at least can handle being on for 3 weeks(not left it on for longer) pretty well(even though its got a amd athlon processor)</p>

VPS = virtual private server. This means that a VPS is a virtualized OS sitting on a host box which is usually pretty hefty. The reason why people sell them is because they don’t have to keep buying hardware for each client.</p>
<p>This being said, why would you even consider buying a box just to have a virtual OS on it when you own the entire box. Further more, what’s the point buying legit server hardware when you’re on a domestic internet connection and power grid?</p>

I know what a VPS is… if that wasn’t obvious. Its not unless you buy it brand new then its typically the same price as a desktop.<br>
Eh? Why are you over complicating this? I don’t even get what your trying to get at…<br>
I think your trying to say why aren’t you using it to its full capacity??? In response to that vps’s second hand are cheap, cheaper than second hand desktops a lot of the time, thats why.</p>

<p>One reason why you might want to turn it off is economic.  A typical PC consumes something like 300 watts. Let’s assume that you use your PC for four hours every day, so the other 20 hours it is on would be wasted energy. If electricity costs 10 cents per kilowatt-hour in your area, then that 20 hours represents 60 cents a day. Sixty cents a day adds up to $219 per year.</p>

VPS = virtual private server. This means that a VPS is a virtualized OS sitting on a host box which is usually pretty hefty. The reason why people sell them is because they don’t have to keep buying hardware for each client.</p>
<p>This being said, why would you even consider buying a box just to have a virtual OS on it when you own the entire box. Further more, what’s the point buying legit server hardware when you’re on a domestic internet connection and power grid?<br>

I know what a VPS is… if that wasn’t obvious. Its not unless you buy it brand new then its typically the same price as a desktop.<br>
Eh? Why are you over complicating this? I don’t even get what your trying to get at…<br>
I think your trying to say why aren’t you using it to its full capacity??? In response to that vps’s second hand are cheap, cheaper than second hand desktops a lot of the time, thats why.[/quote]<br>
you don’t buy physical VPS’s… they’re not physical items whether you’re building a machine to run virtual guests or renting a virtual guest from a hosting company… VPS’s are headless virtual machines.</p>
