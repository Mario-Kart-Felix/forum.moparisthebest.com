    <description>Where can I find the cheapest servers to run some stuff on?

I actually want to buy a vps or dedicated server and set it up in my house so I can run some stuff on it.

Where should I go to get the cheapest one&#39;s because I don&#39;t want to get ripped.</description>

<p>VPS = virtual private server. This means that a VPS is a virtualized OS sitting on a host box which is usually pretty hefty. The reason why people sell them is because they don’t have to keep buying hardware for each client.</p>

<p>I know what a VPS is… if that wasn’t obvious. Its not unless you buy it brand new then its typically the same price as a desktop.<br>
Eh? Why are you over complicating this? I don’t even get what your trying to get at…<br>
I think your trying to say why aren’t you using it to its full capacity??? In response to that vps’s second hand are cheap, cheaper than second hand desktops a lot of the time, thats why.</p>

<p>you don’t buy physical VPS’s… they’re not physical items whether you’re building a machine to run virtual guests or renting a virtual guest from a hosting company… VPS’s are headless virtual machines.<br>

Ah I get what your meaning now, I portray what I’m thinking badly a lot of the time. I meant buy a server basically, not use a desktop for a servers job&gt;.&gt;. I just call them vps’s because when I browse ebay I usually find them named under vps’s…<br>

i’m going to disregard the last part of your reply because i’m not going down that road.</p>
<p>here’s a really cool thing: server hardware and desktop hardware has no difference, especially on the scale you’ll be using the machine for. i don’t really understand your gripe at using a desktop machine as a server (yeah a desktop OS may not be the best of choices, but the hardware is).[/quote]<br>
Yes, I know that… I meant how its been made as I previously said, sigh. I explain things badly and I can’t be bothered trying to explain it, your thinking I’m saying something I’m not :L</p>

VPS = virtual private server. This means that a VPS is a virtualized OS sitting on a host box which is usually pretty hefty. The reason why people sell them is because they don’t have to keep buying hardware for each client.</p>
<p>This being said, why would you even consider buying a box just to have a virtual OS on it when you own the entire box. Further more, what’s the point buying legit server hardware when you’re on a domestic internet connection and power grid?[/quote]<br>
I know what a VPS is… if that wasn’t obvious. Its not unless you buy it brand new then its typically the same price as a desktop.<br>
Eh? Why are you over complicating this? I don’t even get what your trying to get at…<br>
I think your trying to say why aren’t you using it to its full capacity??? In response to that vps’s second hand are cheap, cheaper than second hand desktops a lot of the time, thats why.</p>

</aside>
<p>You can get desktops dirt cheap second hand etc. Some people give them away for free like I have a computer sitting in my room which is completely outdated but still has half decent specs.<br>
I’d just buy a second hand vps of ebay as there cheap and there aimed at hosting, consideration is taken into how a vps is made as when its made they know its going to be on near enough 24/7.<br>
Computers aren’t meant for that although mines at least can handle being on for 3 weeks(not left it on for longer) pretty well(even though its got a amd athlon processor)</p>

just build a comp with good enough specs for what you intend to serve on it. DMZ it and run it 24/7 and you’re done.</p>

<p>Why so? Not looking to run anything important on them. I don’t want to run a whole datacenter at my house I just want like 1 server.[/quote]Just internal stuff? Then I guess it’d be ok.
