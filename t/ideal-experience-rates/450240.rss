    <description>How fast should Combat Experience be? Do you want all 99&#39;s in Combat overnight?

Do you think Skilling should have slow experience [b]IF[/b] it has a lot of content to offer and is also very rewarding? Perhaps a week per 99?

Do you like to walk back and forth to the bank to smelt bars, or would you rather have a designated area to make skilling easier and less of a hassle?



Do you believe that a x2 Skilling Experience rate would be acceptable, if the content is unique and original like this:

<p>What about the slayer skill? This isn’t based on interactions, and is quite random depending on what task you get. You could, I guess, just increase the experience you gain from killing a monster depending on your level, but you couldn’t calculate how long it would take to get 99 based on interactions or anything. The experience gained per task is random as you can be assigned a different range of monsters and amount.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s valid. You could offer a special reward for finishing a task, and that reward could be based on your level. Otherwise you could assign a “slayer level” with the “difficulty” of a certain monster (ie, each monster would be gauged at a different slayer level from 1-99), and then you could scale the experience received from those monsters based on my example model or another model. Even though the easiest slayer master will be assigning monsters from levels 1-15 or 1-20 (arbitrary, of course), your experience would be kept scaled relative to the task you get. You should just hope for a “higher-level” task, even though it may well be harder.</p>

Just make the experience scale slower than the rate of the experience going up. So say 10 interactions to get lvl 1-2, but at levels 98-99 it may be 150. Still worth more experience and a lot less interactions if it stayed at a static amount.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That would be an interesting idea. You could start at 10 interactions for 1-2 and add 1 more interaction for each subsequent level. You need nearly 100 interactions for 98-99. The arithmetic growth rate results in an increasingly smaller percentage difference each time, never keeping up with the growth rate for experience and thus needing some pretty massive exp drops for the higher levels (kinda obvious, since 100 interactions for 98-99 would lead to around 10,000 exp each interaction). Also noting that this creates an arithmetic series of the form 10 + sum from index n = 1 to 97 of n, if you want to find the total number of interactions. For those curious, it comes out to 4,763 interactions for level 99. If each interaction takes 3 game ticks, it comes out to about 142.89 minutes, or 2.3815 hours (2 hours, 22 minutes, and 53.4 seconds) of gameplay for that level 99.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration this pattern would be used for all the skills, a user would have to play roughly 57 hours, 9 minutes, and 21.6 seconds in order to achieve 99 in 24 skills. This doesn’t count idle time or losing game ticks as they are leveling. For someone that plays a private server 4-5 hours per day (which I would consider a ton), it would take them a week and a half of continuous game time in order to max out, not to mention missed game ticks. I would just round up to 2 weeks of private server training.[/quote]<br>
sounds quite optimal, if they’re dedicated and loving it enough.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that most players are under age 18 and they do not play all day. Also, kids have short attention spans and unless they REALLY like a server they will not play it hours on end to level up. If you are looking to add a challenge make it like x50. This way people are still leveling but it is fast enough to where users will not get bored and get off.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:17, topic:450240”]Personally I don’t like Taharoks idea, I like the current concept where 98-99 takes longer to get than 18-19. Even if you don’t use the 20 item example (which is much too low), it doesn’t make much sense to me that leveling lower skills takes the same amount of time at higher levels. I’m not saying Jagex does the formula right, but I definitely prefer that to what Taharok said.</p>
<p>Anyways, on the subject of levels. Playing a good 3-4 hours per day, I think 2-3 weeks is a good time frame to get a level 99 in a non-combat skill. In combat skills, probably a week. This should keep people interested with still being able to get levels fairly easily, but they can’t completely max out in an outrageous amount of time. On my server, I had 20x XP, but I also had max level 120 on all of my stats so it still took people ages to max :P[/quote]</p>
<p>I did give an extreme example. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> My example was to demonstrate the idea of balancing your experience rates with the amounts you need each time. You can do so nonlinearly, so that it does take longer to get higher levels. The issues with private servers is overall time, though. You don’t want to get a level 99 skill in 1 day, nor do you in 2-3 weeks (let’s face it, I can get most 99s on live runescape in 2-3 weeks). The balance should come somewhere in the middle, based on the activity of the server. If it’s a super active server, then 1-2 weeks at the very longest would be a fair time frame. If it’s not so popular, I would say 2-3 days is probably a good interval.</p>

I do want to feel accomplished when I get 99, however it’s also not very fun spending 2 weeks grinding a single skill.</p>
<p>Since it seems like every server has a prestige system, why not make it so that each time you prestige, exp gets slower and slower?  This should put some use to it other than just no lifing to get to 10th prestige in a week and buying full torva (or whatever the best stuff in it is) from some shitty shop.</p>
