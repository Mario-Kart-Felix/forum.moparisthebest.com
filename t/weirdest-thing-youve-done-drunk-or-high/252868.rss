After smoking a fairly decent amount of pretty good pot, while walking back to my house there was a faily decent sized puddle (3 feet wide by 10-15 feet long) and when i walked up to it, i exclaimed to my two friends who were also high “oh my god! it’s a river!” then stood there for a good minute thinking of the best way to traverse this obstacle</p>

<p>To be honest it’s not THAT much. I’ve had lots more and I probably drink that much everytime I go out. If you go to parties everyone drinks that much. I’d even say usually more. Most people drink a 768 ml bottle here. Though I do live in an anomoly town known for alcoholics and druggies.[/quote]</p>
<p>Whenever I get past the 500mL vodka mark I don’t remember anything (literally), and others have to remind me of the entire night. Oh well.</p>

              <p>One of my friends made some pot cookies (he claimed there was about an 8th in each one, I don’t personally believe it), I ate a couple. Cookies take a while, so I decided I would go smoke a little. A couple joints later I was feeling good, so I went back inside the movie theater (staff screening of Pineapple Express) and enjoy the movie. After a fucking hilarious movie, my friends wanted to go party, we drove to one of their houses. Along the way the cookies kicked in. I really started tripping balls. Apparently I was hanging out the window yelling at people. When we stopped to get Tim Horton’s, they lost me. I ran off because something was whispering to me in the back seat of the car and I didn’t like that. I ended up being found laughing. I laughed at something, then I was laughing at the fact that I couldn’t stop laughing. Not the weirdest, just a really fun night.</p>

<p>To be honest it’s not THAT much. I’ve had lots more and I probably drink that much everytime I go out. If you go to parties everyone drinks that much. I’d even say usually more. Most people drink a 768 ml bottle here. Though I do live in an anomoly town known for alcoholics and druggies.<br>

<p>Once when i stayed with my cousin for a week. We went to our grandmas house while she was in florida and called his mom to tell her were watching a movie and crashing there. We decided we should try wine. So we both dropped a bottle in about 5 minutes and NOTHING HAPPENED. 20 minutes later neither of us could walk and we called some friends over. I most likely did some fucked up shit that night.</p>
