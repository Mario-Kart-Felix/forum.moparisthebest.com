    <description>first of all i hope this topic won&#39;t b erase.  :D . hey i reall don&#39;t have lot of time for coding but i really want to make a server for my comunity. i want to host a 24/7 server (no big -special- effect or anithing like it) i want to host a regular server the only diefferent is that the server that i want would have member fetures useble for nonmembers (no extra xp while training) if this is posible plz post here. if u r intereste say about how much will cost me. oh another thing i would like is a client that will conect straight to my server (also will pay for this. even though is not as inportant as the server for now) the client doesnt matter how would look -i would prefer moparscape client but it the condition that would connect to my server withough user have to put ip or anything like that.

                                                              &quot; i ask moparscape not to erase this topic. as ya serve the people i also would like to serve tham&quot; thx[br][size=1]Posted on: January 05, 2007, 03:44:58 AM[/size][hr]bump - i won&#39;t bump frenquantly</description>
