    <title>Need help with updating mask 0x400 (animated movement)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-updating-mask-0x400-animated-movement/544582</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m trying to get the animated movement updating working.

I have this now:
[code=java]
		updateBlock.writeByteC(startLocation.getX()); //loc x
		updateBlock.writeByteS(startLocation.getY()); //loc y
		updateBlock.writeByteS(endLocation.getX()); //loc x 2
		updateBlock.writeByteC(endLocation.getY()); //loc y 2
		updateBlock.writeShort(10); //movement speed
		updateBlock.writeShortA(0); //back movement speed
		updateBlock.writeByte(4); //direction
[/code]
My target location is 5 on the x-axis away from the start location, though my character moves like 30 tiles.
I already tried using the region coordinates instead of the absolute world coordinates, but it does the same.
Anybody know how to properly use this update?



From the wiki: http://rsps.wikia.com/wiki/317_Protocol
&lt;blockquote&gt;0x400 The 0x400 mask is used to update the player so they appear to be asynchronously animating and walking. This mask is often used for the Agility skill. The data associated goes in order of: byte (type C) which is the first location&#39;s X coordinate value, byte (type S) which is the first location&#39;s Y coordinate value, byte (type S) which is the second location&#39;s X coordinate value, byte (type C) the second location&#39;s Y coordinate value. After the locations are written, there is a required movement speed which is written as a short which marks how fast to move from position 1 to position 2. Another short (type A) is written as the movement speed going from position 2 to position 1. Finally one byte is written to end the mask block, which marks the direction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
