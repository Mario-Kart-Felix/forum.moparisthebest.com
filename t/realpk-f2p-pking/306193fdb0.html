<p>I basing it off the argument you had with peter in the other thread. If you even had the sligest bit of experiance you would know what the problem was but nope…you kept defending your wrong answer. Yes, im using one argument as my supoort because even a beggniner should know what that error was. Also, you were reffering to the Java API website as a “help site” so naturally who wouldn’t think that you know something about programming?</p>

<p>Lol, jessekins two words black cunt.</p>
<p>Dole? I work at a company called ultimate-products as an IT Technician / Administrator part time aswell as doing a college course, Btec national diploma level 3 equivalent to 3 a levels basically and i’ll be in university next year doing an IT + PGCE so i can teach at colleges or schools. Nice try though.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>HOW is that relevant to you being full of shit?</p>
<p>I don’t care about you or what you do. I guarantee I know more than you do about viruses and computer programming. So not only what you said was irrelevant, it’s worthless.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, your computer programming skills really showed when you were hosting fail-pk didn’t it?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I wasn’t the one coding on RSCPK. Try again kiddo.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Still dosen’t change the fact that you still don’t know jack all about computer programming.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So because I chose to play the administrator role instead of the coder role, I don’t know HOW? Nice logic you’re using there kiddo.<br>
Also, I never released anything by choice, I never actually shown anyone anything that I’ve done from the past year. How/what are you basing my skills off of? Oh let me guess… Nothing.</p>
<p>Lol.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I basing it off the argument you had with peter in the other thread. If you even had the sligest bit of experiance you would know what the problem was but nope…you kept defending your wrong answer. Yes, im using one argument as my supoort because even a beggniner should know what that error was. Also, you were reffering to the Java API website as a “help site” so naturally who wouldn’t think that you know something about programming?[/quote]</p>
<p>I was supporting <span class="bbcode-b">MY</span> answer that I gave, since Peter thought it was so funny. Regardless if it was wrong or not.<br>
I knew what the error was. There could be only 3 possibilities. Either the class was named wrong, it was in the wrong place or the idea that I had. He eliminated it being in the wrong place and it being named correctly. Now what was the 3rd possibility again?</p>
<p>Even more, basing what I know off of 1 cause that I was supporting can tell you all you need to know? You must really not have an argument here.</p>
<p>Also you’re saying that it’s not a help site? Then what is it exactly? Tell me this, why did Peter show me the link? To ____ his argument. The blank starts with a H and it’s a 4 letter word. Can you figure it out?<br>
Hell, with the logic you’re using, I mine as well give you 3 of the letters and you still wouldn’t know.</p>

<p>The Java API website is not a help site, its a website that has detailed expliniation of all the methods and possible errors that can occur when working with Java.

<p>I’m good where I am. You’re the only one over exaggerating the situation. My point still stands. The only thing you have to hold on to is what the error said. Yet you still don’t understand that “cannot find package” and “classnotfound” is basically the same thing. Lol.</p>

<p>I said basically the same thing. “read next time before posting”.</p>
<p>I never said I <span class="bbcode-b">wasn’t</span> a hypocrite, and I’m not trying NOT to be one. I don’t care if you think I’m a hypocrite, I couldn’t care less. I haven’t the slightest clue how I judged him, and yet I don’t even care enough to go look back. I guess it’s not that important. Keep struggling to find things to say against me “adu”, and you’ll keep failing.</p>
<p>So first it was because of something I suggested, NOW it’s because I HAVEN’T shown any of my work? You are just one big joke kid.<br>
The thing about being a grown ass man, is you don’t HAVE to do anything you don’t want to. I code what I want to code for <span class="bbcode-b">myself</span>. Not for a bunch of snotty nose brats like yourself to leech off of. If you really care that much to see my work, then stick around. One of these days I’ll care enough to show you. On <span class="bbcode-b">my</span> time, not yours.</p>
<p>Oh, if you haven’t noticed, saying I’m a hypocrite because I judged “Freaky5000” makes you a hypocrite. Why? Because you are judging me. Good job hypocrite.</p>
<p>I was never in a “hole” to begin with. And someone as idiotic as you would never put me there.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Jessekinss, post:78, topic:306193”]I said basically the same thing. “read next time before posting”.</p>
<p>I never said I <span class="bbcode-b">wasn’t</span> a hypocrite, and I’m not trying NOT to be one. I don’t care if you think I’m a hypocrite, I couldn’t care less. I haven’t the slightest clue how I judged him, and yet I don’t even care enough to go look back. I guess it’s not that important. Keep struggling to find things to say against me “adu”, and you’ll keep failing.</p>
<p>So first it was because of something I suggested, NOW it’s because I HAVEN’T shown any of my work? You are just one big joke kid.<br>
The thing about being a grown ass man, is you don’t HAVE to do anything you don’t want to. I code what I want to code for <span class="bbcode-b">myself</span>. Not for a bunch of snotty nose brats like yourself to leech off of. If you really care that much to see my work, then stick around. One of these days I’ll care enough to show you. On <span class="bbcode-b">my</span> time, not yours.</p>
<p>Oh, if you haven’t noticed, saying I’m a hypocrite because I judged “Freaky5000” makes you a hypocrite. Why? Because you are judging me. Good job hypocrite.</p>
<p>I was never in a “hole” to begin with. And someone as idiotic as you would never put me there.[/quote]</p>
<p>It still isnt “basically” the same thing. There is a major difference and that difference is not small enough to say “basically the same thing”.</p>
<p>How am I a joke when I am asking you to prove your work? If someone says they found a cure for cancer wouldn.t you be asking them to prove it? Anyone(you) can go around saying they can do this and that but only a few people (NOT you) can prove it.</p>
<p>Im sure if you ever released something, it would be too worthless to leech off. I can’t wait for the day the almighty Computer Programmer releases something and when you do,  I can bet that it will end up being a piece of garbage anyways.</p>
<p>PS - By you judging freaky with no proof gave me the right to judge you the same and you guessed it, it also gives others the right to judge me too.</p>
