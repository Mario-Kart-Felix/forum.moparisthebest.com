I said basically the same thing. “read next time before posting”.</p>
<p>I never said I <span class="bbcode-b">wasn’t</span> a hypocrite, and I’m not trying NOT to be one. I don’t care if you think I’m a hypocrite, I couldn’t care less. I haven’t the slightest clue how I judged him, and yet I don’t even care enough to go look back. I guess it’s not that important. Keep struggling to find things to say against me “adu”, and you’ll keep failing.</p>
<p>So first it was because of something I suggested, NOW it’s because I HAVEN’T shown any of my work? You are just one big joke kid.<br>
The thing about being a grown ass man, is you don’t HAVE to do anything you don’t want to. I code what I want to code for <span class="bbcode-b">myself</span>. Not for a bunch of snotty nose brats like yourself to leech off of. If you really care that much to see my work, then stick around. One of these days I’ll care enough to show you. On <span class="bbcode-b">my</span> time, not yours.</p>
<p>Oh, if you haven’t noticed, saying I’m a hypocrite because I judged “Freaky5000” makes you a hypocrite. Why? Because you are judging me. Good job hypocrite.</p>
<p>I was never in a “hole” to begin with. And someone as idiotic as you would never put me there.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It still isnt “basically” the same thing. There is a major difference and that difference is not small enough to say “basically the same thing”.</p>
<p>How am I a joke when I am asking you to prove your work? If someone says they found a cure for cancer wouldn.t you be asking them to prove it? Anyone(you) can go around saying they can do this and that but only a few people (NOT you) can prove it.</p>
<p>Im sure if you ever released something, it would be too worthless to leech off. I can’t wait for the day the almighty Computer Programmer releases something and when you do,  I can bet that it will end up being a piece of garbage anyways.</p>
<p>PS - By you judging freaky with no proof gave me the right to judge you the same and you guessed it, it also gives others the right to judge me too.[/quote]</p>
<p>We’re not talking about cancer, we’re talking about programming java. It is not important enough (especially not important enough as cancer) to prove. You’re a joke because you’re <span class="bbcode-b">assuming</span> that I cannot program because of your own idiotic reasons (that make no sense at all).<br>
Yeah, anyone can go around saying the can cure cancer. I’d expect them to do so. Seeing as this isn’t as serious, I’m not obligated to do so. You can’t get it wrapped around your head that I (Jessekins) doesn’t <span class="bbcode-b">have</span> to do anything I don’t want to do, so you <span class="bbcode-b">assume</span> that I can’t do it all together. That’s what makes you a joke.</p>
<p>Anything that I release, in <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> eyes will be garbage anyways. Keeping that in mind, tell me why I should release anything at all? Why should I waste my time?  I’ll answer for you. It’s not worth it. No wait, <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> aren’t worth it.</p>
<p>How do you know I’m judging freaky off of any proof? There goes another one of your assumptions that you can’t even back up.<br>
Also, it doesn’t give you any right at all. As a matter of fact, it makes you as wrong as us. I expected to hear something idiotic from knowing the logic you’re using. But like I said, if you don’t want to look like a jackass, feel free to delete your posts.</p>
<p>Tell me how it’s 2 different things. If the import directory is not there, then obviously it cannot find the class. And if the server cannot find the class, it means the class isn’t there. How isn’t it “basically” the same thing?</p>

<p>Mmmkk then, If you don’t want to post anything to prove me wrong then there is no point in me comming back to this topic and continuing this argument. Im not gonna bother replying to your posts until I see somthing worth replying to.</p>
<p>Go read up some java help sites and you will find the difference k?</p>

<p>PS - By you judging freaky with no proof gave me the right to judge you the same and you guessed it, it also gives others the right to judge me too.</p>

<p>We’re not talking about cancer, we’re talking about programming java. It is not important enough (especially not important enough as cancer) to prove. You’re a joke because you’re <span class="bbcode-b">assuming</span> that I cannot program because of your own idiotic reasons (that make no sense at all).<br>
Yeah, anyone can go around saying the can cure cancer. I’d expect them to do so. Seeing as this isn’t as serious, I’m not obligated to do so. You can’t get it wrapped around your head that I (Jessekins) doesn’t <span class="bbcode-b">have</span> to do anything I don’t want to do, so you <span class="bbcode-b">assume</span> that I can’t do it all together. That’s what makes you a joke.</p>
<p>Anything that I release, in <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> eyes will be garbage anyways. Keeping that in mind, tell me why I should release anything at all? Why should I waste my time?  I’ll answer for you. It’s not worth it. No wait, <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> aren’t worth it.</p>
<p>How do you know I’m judging freaky off of any proof? There goes another one of your assumptions that you can’t even back up.<br>
Also, it doesn’t give you any right at all. As a matter of fact, it makes you as wrong as us. I expected to hear something idiotic from knowing the logic you’re using. But like I said, if you don’t want to look like a jackass, feel free to delete your posts.</p>
<p>Tell me how it’s 2 different things. If the import directory is not there, then obviously it cannot find the class. And if the server cannot find the class, it means the class isn’t there. How isn’t it “basically” the same thing?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Mmmkk then, If you don’t want to post anything to prove me wrong then there is no point in me comming back to this topic and continuing this argument. Im not gonna bother replying to your posts until I see somthing worth replying to.</p>
<p>Go read up some java help sites and you will find the difference k?[/quote]</p>
<p>Damn… I was expecting a huge post to respond to. Now I made you run away?<br>
I don’t have to prove anything to you, because you were never right to begin with. You were always wrong, that’s what I tried telling you. Now you finally understand.</p>
<p>Oh, so you tried feeding me some bullshit and you can’t even back it up? And you don’t know why you’re a joke?</p>
<p>Lol.</p>

<p>Where is his so called “successful” server? I don’t see it. Oh wait, he doesn’t have one. Must not have been that much of a success, now was it?<br>
Where has he proven it? Because he knew the difference between compiling and run time errors? Kid please, you really need hush.<br>
Also how does he know more about computers than I do? Where do we even talk about computers? Lmfao.</p>

<p>“and computers infact, than you”?</p>
<p>No.</p>

<p>Help me make sense of this.<br>
If I wasn’t an ignorant “retard” then I wouldn’t go arguing in every thread I go in?</p>
<p>Lol.</p>
<p>What is your point? I didn’t code for RSCPK (yes you knew the name kid, don’t even try that) but I did learn a lot from it. What are you getting at? I don’t see it.</p>
<p>And there go your useless assumptions. You bet I’m no good at it? Good for you, whoop deee dooo, I couldn’t give a fuck.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Kozy, post:86, topic:306193”]Adu isn’t a joke you ape, unlike you, he’s ran a successful server multiple times, and has proven that he knows more about java, and computers infact, than you. If you weren’t such an ignorant retard, who thinks he knows everything, then maybe you wouldn’t get into an arguement in every thread you venture into. You just say the same thing over and over, and you use fucking <span class="bbcode-b">BOLD</span> words that you think make you look smart. Guess what, <span class="bbcode-b"> I CAN DO IT TO </span></p>
<p>Oh, you said you decided to not be the coder for RSC-PK or w/e your server was called in order to do the roll of manager, but infact you have stated before that you did RSC-PK to learn how to code, because you didn’t even know how. (And I would bet your not so good still.)</p>
<p>Don’t lie, you fucking inbred nigger.[/quote]</p>
<p>LOL @ you judging who’s made a successful server. Since you can’t seem to take a hint, or realize your own failure let me point it out to you and Adu.</p>
<p>“Ran a successful server, multiple times” - Funny, since none of them lasted more than a couple weeks. I don’t know, but to me I’d think a successful server would last at least a couple months…</p>
<p>RSCReloaded + failed botnet + Keith attempting to leech code from Jessekins (yes I witnessed it myself) + hardware firewall (rofl @ this, you payed $80-100 for useless protection) = failure. Don’t go bragging about players, because I can guarantee most of them were cheating (including myself). The one line “fish dupe” I added was ridiculously fail, yet none of you expert programmers could figure out what was wrong!</p>
<p>Regardless of the denial you both seem to think, you were still apart of it. Frankly, I’d be embarrassed but that’s just me.<br>
Don’t know who you’re kidding, but neither of you qualify to judge anyone on their “skills”.</p>

        <p>[quote=“freaky5000, post:90, topic:306193”]Send me an EXE go for it, wait don’t i have to accept it first? duh.</p>
<p>That signature of mine you are referring to has been their for over a year, the people that do come to me are not that good with what they are trying to do most of the time i can give them help straight away if not i’ll do the necessary research to try my best to help me. Ok big boy you “know more than me”, but hey idc. I ain’t the retard thinging hes good STILL playing RSC p servers, i’m going to university doing an IT Course and a PGCE course to teach. Please do tell me you know more than me it makes me giggle at how big your ego is. Go pick a banana.[/quote]</p>
<p>For someone who’s in a uni sure isn’t smart. The point of me offering the .EXE is so you can prove what you said earlier, about how you could remove it faster than I could. Now you’re saying you wouldn’t accept it? Tisk tisk tisk.</p>
<p>SO, those people who “aren’t that good” who come to you (those 1 or 2 people), do they know you’re not good yourself?</p>
<p>“Play” RSC servers. That’s pretty funny. What I’m laughing at is that you’re trying to insult me with an inaccurate assumption (that I play RSC servers) when you and everyone else knows I don’t. That accusation was for what exactly? To make you look better because you’re going to school? Whoop dee doo, I go to school full time too. Looks like you have a bit more research to do buddy boy.<br>
You’re laughing now? Because of the fact that I <span class="bbcode-b">do</span> know more than you? Is it because you know it’s right and you’re hiding that fact, or is it because you really are a dumb ass and can’t think of a good comeback to it?</p>
<p>[quote=“BuyMyJunk, post:91, topic:306193”]when the server comes back up ill update my bot, i got past all your checks:)<br>
but i havent touched it in a week or 2, so i dont know when you updated it<br>
im still using it with 255[/quote]</p>
<p>Like I said. Good luck. It’s going to take a bit more than copy and paste this time.</p>
