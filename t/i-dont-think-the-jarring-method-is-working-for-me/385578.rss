    <title>I don&#39;t think the jarring method is working for me</title>

    <description>Ok, after I follow a few of the webclient tutorials, I figure out how to download my cache properly. And it works when I run the runclient.bat in my client folder; however, when I then try to jar and sign it (following tutorials) the cache doesn&#39;t properly download. Either that or there is some other internal error! Anyone know whats up?</description>
