    <description>So I started up my laptop, like I do everyday, just getting ready to browse the internet then right when I had the google opened, suddenly this message pops up:

Not sure if you can see the text, but it says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You have been violation Copyright and Related Rights Law (Video, Music, Software) and illegally using or distributing copyrighted content, thus infringing Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, also known as the Copyright of the Criminal Code of United States of America.

Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Criminal Code provides for a fine of two to five hundred minimal wages or a deprivation of liberty for two to eight years.

You have been viewing or distributing prohibited Pornographic content (Child Porno, Zoofilia and etc). Thus violating article 202 of the Criminal Code of United States of America. Article 202 of the Criminal Code provides for a deprivation of liberty for four to twelve years.

Illegal access has been initiated from your PC without your knowledge or consent, your PC may be infected by malware, thus you are violating the law of Neglectful Use of Personal Computer. Article 210 of the Criminal Code provides for a fine of up to $100,000 and/or a deprivation of liberty for four to nine years.

Pursuant to the amendment to the Criminal Code of United States of America of May 28, 2011, this law infringement (if it is not repeated - first time) may be considered as conditional in case you pay the fine to the State.

Fines may be paid within 72 hours after the infringement. As soon as 72 hours elapse, the possibility to pay the fine expires, and a criminal case is initiated against you automatically within the next 72 hours!
To unblock the computer, you must pay the fine through MoneyPak of 100$.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no way in hell that I viewed child porn. But I did try to download the Slender game on the piratebay.. I think I got this virus from there.. 
Why do I think it&#39;s a virus? Because it says I must pay $100 to get access back to my laptop, then all &#39;charges&#39; would be dropped..

Does anyone here know what I should do? I know tom is good with helping people in this type of situation..</description>

Woah, I didn’t realize how many people were infected with this :eek:</p>
<p>By the way, I finally removed this from my PC… It did take up most of my day, but at least I didn’t have to pay someone to take care of this problem for me.<br>

<p>Not sure if you can see the text, but it says:</p>

There is no way in hell that I viewed child porn. But I did try to download the Slender game on the piratebay… I think I got this virus from there…<br>
Why do I think it’s a virus? Because it says I must pay $100 to get access back to my laptop, then all ‘charges’ would be dropped…
<p>Does anyone here know what I should do? I know tom is good with helping people in this type of situation…</p>
