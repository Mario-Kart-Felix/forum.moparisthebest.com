As the title is saying.. i cant host on no-ip ... im looking for someone to host my server and keep me owner. the person that would host it can make them self admin w/e. The person should host it for a reasonable amount of time doesnt have to be 24/7. I need the server to be something like .no-ip.info or something like that. Contact me on rmds89@hotmail.co.uk
