    <title>So, the creative whitelist</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-the-creative-whitelist/442961</link>
    <description>Is a tad of a problem, while it does what we intended it does it too well so to speak. Literally nobody can access the creative world (Or do anything anyway) despite them being well respected players. 

I think we need a seperate whitelist, or perhaps a new rank which combines the two and other things, for example:

*insert rank name here* - Has TNT access, Creative world access, if we ever wanted too we could even throw in a board in the future, though right now I don&#39;t see it as necessary. Of course the rank isn&#39;t visible it&#39;s just something that we can reference. 

It doesn&#39;t have to be like &quot;respected super duper awesome member&quot; followed by smiley faces, just something like all access member that can be easily put and linked with the features above. 

I can then replace the TNT topic with an application topic which links the two and potentially we could now lower the requirements as we can rollback TNT so it isn&#39;t that big of an issue. I think right now we&#39;ve put the bar too high.</description>

<p>The PermissionsEx doesn’t look like it’s designed to modify(update) the player’s group(with a single method) but since now I know your using group inheritance and the player only has one group you can just remove it if it isn’t the purposed group read from the authURL and then you call the add group function to update the players group to the one being read. But I’d rather wait for the next authURL update and if he doesn’t add it, I know exactly how to.</p>

lol. So he is aware so maybe he will work on it.
<p>Looks like your out of luck mitb, upon farther investigation and attempting to add this it looks like xAuth currently isn’t design to be able to do it.<br>
And I’d have to change a serious amount of code to get it working. <span class="bbcode-s">The exact</span>One problem is loading the groups, I don’t know much about authURL(looks simple enough) but</p>
<blockquote>if (plugin.getConfig().getBoolean("authurl.groups"))
				group = in.readLine();</blockquote>
Does that not look like it's designed to only read one group? I don't know enough about it to know whether or not all groups are sent at once or not.
<p>If it does put all the groups into that one string then I’d still have another problem of updating the players permissions through PermissionsEx because there’s nothing native to xAuth to hook onto that would be efficient enough to update(add/remove) the players permissions properly.</p>
<p>Quick answer if tl;dr, it’s possible but would be non-efficient and ugly to constantly check if the players permissions need to be updated or removed every time authURL is used? You would have to check if the player already has that permission &amp; if it needs to be added &amp; if it needs to be removed. And I don’t feel confident enough to think I could modify the most important plugin installed safely.</p>

<p>I think we need a seperate whitelist, or perhaps a new rank which combines the two and other things, for example:</p>
<p><em>insert rank name here</em> - Has TNT access, Creative world access, if we ever wanted too we could even throw in a board in the future, though right now I don’t see it as necessary. Of course the rank isn’t visible it’s just something that we can reference.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be like “respected super duper awesome member” followed by smiley faces, just something like all access member that can be easily put and linked with the features above.</p>
<p>I can then replace the TNT topic with an application topic which links the two and potentially we could now lower the requirements as we can rollback TNT so it isn’t that big of an issue. I think right now we’ve put the bar too high.</p>
