    <description>[center][b]ABOUT:[/b][/center]
[center]My server is an oldschool server 2007 based. NOT OSRS, before all that. I&#39;m trying to make it an enjoyable experience for everyone. Xp rates are slow but not too slow and there&#39;s bosses and minigames. Very similar to most servers. I need help with unique ideas and implementing them into the server. My source is up and running and I need committed people who are passionate about oldschool servers. My goal isn&#39;t to make this a money maker server, but for players to enjoy and stay a while, not just hop on and leave.[/center]


[center]I need 1 client developer, 1 server developer and multiple beta testers 4-6[/center]

When you add me on Skype message me the following

If you&#39;re interested my Skype is server.help1</description>

              <p>I sent you a message on skype. I have been around since early 2008 and i like to beta test games in general and private servers as well. I’ve tested some games that have been testing out a few over seas game here recently i have been testing out a private server based around zardwars using updated code and classic rips. i quit playing triad wars the closed beta.</p>
<p>I would happily test out your server.</p>
