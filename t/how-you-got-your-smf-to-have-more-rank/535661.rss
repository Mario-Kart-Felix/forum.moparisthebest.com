    <title>How you got your SMF to have more rank</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-you-got-your-smf-to-have-more-rank/535661</link>
    <description>I was wondering how you guys got you SMF to show more than one rank image under a users name.
Like one of your members has a retired staff rank image and also a web designer rank image. How did y&#39;all achieve this? Any info would be greatly appreciated :D</description>

<p>I took the liberty of installing it on localhost and trying it, it works with the most recent version of SMF 2.0 and can be configured to look exactly like how Mopar has them now. All you need to do is navigate to the mod settings and disable the frame and increase the number of displayable awards in posts, then it works the same way this site does. I would stick with this mod instead of the one we use anyway, this one is way more organised.[/quote]<br>
Thank you so much, Tom. Your awesome.</p>
