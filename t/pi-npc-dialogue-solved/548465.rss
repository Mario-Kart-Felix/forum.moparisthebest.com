[size=14pt][b]NPC Dialogue[/b][/size]
Hey guys, I&#39;d like to know how to get my NPC &quot;Information Clerk&quot; (NPC ID: 5938) to have dialogue when a player talks to her. An NPC in my source called &quot;Duradel&quot; has dialogue, as seen here:
[IMG]http://i1031.photobucket.com/albums/y380/mrpopyman/duradelspeak_zps1bda91e0.png[/img]

This is what&#39;s in DialogueHandler.java:
[code=java]case 11:
			sendNpcChat4(&quot;Hello!&quot;, &quot;My name is Duradel and I am a master of the slayer skill.&quot;, &quot;I can assign you a slayer task suitable to your combat level.&quot;, 
			&quot;Would you like a slayer task?&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Duradel&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 12;
		break;
		case 12:
			sendOption2(&quot;Yes I would like a slayer task.&quot;, &quot;No I would not like a slayer task.&quot;);
			c.dialogueAction = 5;
		break;
		case 13:
			sendNpcChat4(&quot;Hello!&quot;, &quot;My name is Duradel and I am a master of the slayer skill.&quot;, &quot;I see I have already assigned you a task to complete.&quot;, 
			&quot;Would you like me to give you an easier task?&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Duradel&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 14;
		break;
		case 14:
			sendOption2(&quot;Yes I would like an easier task.&quot;, &quot;No I would like to keep my task.&quot;);
			c.dialogueAction = 6;
		break;[/code]

How do I make other NPC&#39;s have dialogue?

Hey guys, I’d like to know how to get my NPC “Information Clerk” (NPC ID: 5938) to have dialogue when a player talks to her. An NPC in my source called “Duradel” has dialogue, as seen here:<br>
<img src="http://i1031.photobucket.com/albums/y380/mrpopyman/duradelspeak_zps1bda91e0.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>This is what’s in DialogueHandler.java:</p>
<p><code>case 11:
			sendNpcChat4("Hello!", "My name is Duradel and I am a master of the slayer skill.", "I can assign you a slayer task suitable to your combat level.", 
			"Would you like a slayer task?", c.talkingNpc, "Duradel");
			c.nextChat = 12;
		break;
		case 12:
			sendOption2("Yes I would like a slayer task.", "No I would not like a slayer task.");
			c.dialogueAction = 5;
		break;
		case 13:
			sendNpcChat4("Hello!", "My name is Duradel and I am a master of the slayer skill.", "I see I have already assigned you a task to complete.", 
			"Would you like me to give you an easier task?", c.talkingNpc, "Duradel");
			c.nextChat = 14;
		break;
		case 14:
			sendOption2("Yes I would like an easier task.", "No I would like to keep my task.");
			c.dialogueAction = 6;
		break;</code></p>
<p>How do I make other NPC’s have dialogue?</p>
