    <title>Looking for experienced Server Makers. Co-Owner spot reward!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-experienced-server-makers-co-owner-spot-reward/42326</link>
    <description>Hi, I just recently tried to make my own server, but I got too confused. Too complicated for myself. So... I decided to have somebody else do it, and in exchange i&#39;ll give them full Co-Owner privileges. I&#39;ll also guarantee them a lifetime spot on my server as Co-Admin, you can never be removed from ym server unless you want me to do so! So, if you think you can integrate my ideas for the server then I accept you. I have both an AIM and a YAHOO account. My name on both is DrunkM0nk3yz. Please help me out!</description>
