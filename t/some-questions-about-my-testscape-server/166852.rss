    <title>Some Questions about My TestScape server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-questions-about-my-testscape-server/166852</link>
    <description>I am making a testscape server and i have a few questions:

1.I know how to change emote bars to teleports eg. laugh takes you to KBD but how do you change it so it is not called &#39;Laugh&#39; but is called &#39;KBD&#39;, how change emote bar names?

2. Then scince the fact that i am erasing the Emotes, how do i get the emotes put onto the music tab scince there is no music. (It saying the emote and NOT the music)

3. how would I get Summoning onto my TestScape server so it is in the music bar ABOVE the emotes (copy and paste from Pimpscape dosn&#39;t work)

4. How get more skills on it eg. THere is no agility on it, how add agility skill and courses?

5. Minigames? Eg. Castle Wars, or pest control.

6. Ancient Magiks in the tab beside the smiley face and a quest needed to access it

7. How connect make over mage to the char change

Sorry about all this, I am new and I cant work it all out, please either post the code or links to a place where i can find the answers.

Thanks, this is all for now! :D</description>
