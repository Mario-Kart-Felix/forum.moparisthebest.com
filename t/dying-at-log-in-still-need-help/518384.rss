    <title>Dying at log in.! STILL NEED HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dying-at-log-in-still-need-help/518384</link>
    <description>When I log on my delta 317, near some npcs they kill me!!
How do I fix this??? I noticed it with the slayer master at first then i moved him but now im noticing the make-over mage is killing you at log in and so is bob, they only hit you once too, even if they dont kill you.
How do i fix this?!  :confused:  :eek:

Edit:
Even when I log in now sometimes It will kill me randomly at log in, or when people are making new accounts and just logged on for the first time, they might die and there starters will be dropped! 
Edit2: I just logged in and it randomly hit a 40 and even though my hp is 55 it killed me.</description>

              <p>Bob is a shop and make over mage is to change your appearance, I guess what I need to know is how to make them non agressive.<br>
