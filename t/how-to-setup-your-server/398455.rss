    <description>[Before we start this is a rough copy please tell me what needs to be edited]
Hello moparscape(please tell me what needs editing),

This is my guide on how to set up a fully functioning RSPS.
What I will help you with(by either referring you to a detailed guide made by another Moparscape user or by myself)
-How to setup your source(Erased-Pkz source with a few edits done by myself, just started the source as time goes by this will be edited more and more)
-How to setup your client (Hybrid-Pvp v3)
-How to setup a webclient(do love&#39;s guide to change the webclient ready client I have provided to the jar file http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,490803.0.html)
-Downloading and setting up JDK
-The absolute basics(I mean minimilistic)
-portforwarding(utorrent, bittorent way)
+ more which I can&#39;t be assed saying haha :)
(If their is more required please tell me and I&#39;ll most likely add it in]

Difficulty = 1/10
Quality of guide currently(reveiwed by myself) = 4/10
Time needed = N/A, Depends on your speed minimum time most likely an hour
Will help be given? = Yes, if I can help you I will unless its something like &#39;Can you please setup my server via teamviwer&#39;
I will only talk about the source and client I provide but you can obviously use abit of common sense and change the value&#39;s to search etc.
Misc info : Server runs on port 5555 not 43594(edit it if you want)
always keep backups before editing.
Click the photo&#39;s to make them larger.

Please improve your server as your future community(or current) will want updates.

Okay now we shall start:)

Step one
			Setting up JDK(please skip if you already know how to setup, if you cannot use JDK sorry but quite frankly you can&#39;t do RSPS unless a friend compilers for you)


What is JDK?

JDK stands for Java developers kit, its a programme that allows you to edit Java.

You download JDK at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u26-download-400750.html (take note of the jdk you have)

The red circle is for 32bit user&#39;s and blue for 64bit users [URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/96/jdk.png/][IMG]http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/2789/jdk.th.png[/img][/URL]
To find out what type you are (32bit or 64bit) click the window&#39;s start up button(left hand corner). Then right hand click &#39;computer&#39;, then click properties [URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/9/systemtype.png/][IMG]http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/9039/systemtype.th.png[/img][/URL]

Download the approriate JDK file, and agree to everything and let it install (its a 76mb file roughly so it wont take long).

		Setting up your client

Okay, in ideal condition&#39;s you&#39;ll get a source and client that match but as im sure most of the amazing source&#39;s you would like to use have anti-leach&#39;s or whatever stopping you from using them or something.. I would reccomend using the source and client(webclient ready) I provide.

First of all download the client( http://up.ht/mJMHII ).
Okay, if you do not already have winrar(needed to decompress the file and return it to its normal state) the 32bit download is here : http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-32-bit/3000-2250_4-10007677.html 64bit here : http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-64-bit/3000-2250_4-10965579.html (install it obviously).
When you open the file it&#39;ll look like this [URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/862/compress.png/][IMG]http://img862.imageshack.us/img862/9987/compress.th.png[/img][/URL], press the &#39;extract to&#39; option then click desktop(now its on your desktop).

Open the folder, right click the edit option on the compiler, [URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/143/compiler.png/][IMG]http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/6058/compiler.th.png[/img][/URL] now change the highlighted number to your JDK version.
Now your compiler is running, after you do any edits you need to run your compiler for your edits to take place. A compiler converts Java files to Class files. Basically Java files is the file we read and the .class files are the files that computers read. The compiler basically translates it to a language the computer can understand.

I know for a fact you want to change the name of the server in the client (hit ctrl and f at the same time if your using windows xp) search for Cookie-Pkz. Three .Java files should pop-up, the first one is client.java . Try to open it, if your new to this your PC will ask you how you want to open it. Open it with either Notepad (or download netbeans and use that).
Hit(on your keyboard) ctrl and h at the same time. In the &#39;find what&#39; bar type in cookie-pkz , in the replace with bar place in the disired name for your server).
Do the same for your gui.java file, do not do this for the cachedownloader.java file!!
Remember to save these files, now compile.
You should not get any errors, if you do you may post them on this thread for someone to help but I reccomend redoing as it wont take long to redo and it is an error on your behalf!
You have now successfully changed the name of your webclient ready client. Please do edit this in the future though.

		Changing the name of your cache(skip this if your not bothered about it as no-one really looks)

Firstly, download dropbox from this link : www.dropbox.com
Install it yadayada, its simple enough..
Run your client and allow it to download the cache, it shouldn&#39;t take too long its a large DSPK cache but its not that large(100mbs estimate).
Rename your cache(to find it, click windows start button/computer/boot c then you&#39;ll see a &#39;cookie-pkz&#39; file.
Right click the file and click add to archive. Use the archive file format .rar(in blue) compression method, best(red) [URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/862/compress.png/][IMG]http://img862.imageshack.us/img862/9987/compress.png[/img][/URL]

Uploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL] then click ok.
Run your dropbox file then click the &#39;public&#39; folder and put the cache in there. Let the cache upload(takes me 20minutes but my internet speed is TERRIBLE).
Right click the file once uploaded, hover over the dropbox word and then click &#39;copy public link&#39;. 
Now go onto the cachedownloader.java file and search &#39;http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31360318/Cookie-Pkz.zip&#39;, delete it and click paste so your cache link is their, keep doing untill your pc can&#39;t find the link again.
Save file, compile.
You may delete the &#39;cookie-pkz&#39; cache in your c drive now, run your client so your cache downloads (or place your cache in the c drive).
Make another copy of your client, keep one for yourself and one for your players. Leave one as is for yourself(do not if your using a vps or dedicated server, the one with the ip you obtained from whatismyip.org will be the one your players use so upload that for your webclient).
(adding in this part)
Their are commands like ::vote that makes a popup search www.cookie-pkz.com and replace with your website or leave out till later)

		Setting the ip (for youself and players)
Go to www.whatsmyip.org and copy the ip it says is yours (example, not mines btw 97.438.529.619).
In the second client search for 0.0.0.0 and replace it with the your ip or your vps or dedicated server (should be in the client.java and gui.java files).
Save and compile, you will need this for later.



		Setting up your source(not detailed as theirs so much!!)
The source is already up to date(duel and a very few other things are bugged gonna fix after done guide will remove this and update links when fixed) but you will want to change your welcome message etc.
Download link :
This is where the search bar comes in handy also remember to set your jdk version in the &#39;memleak(fixed)&#39; fie and &#39;compiler&#39; (scroll up if you can&#39;t remember what to change).
Search Commands, click the commands.java file and search &#39;fringie&#39; and replace it with the name your going to use ingame.
Now search for the names &#39;fringie&#39;, &#39;Maddy, &#39;Rhino&#39; and replace them with your name. Please may attention to what its saying, for example theirs a line that says Rhino is a super donater, by replacing it and not paying attention you&#39;d be saying your the super donater(in the news announcements).
save, compile.
Now search Cookie-pkz, open the files that comes up and search Cookie-pkz in the files then &#39;cookie-pkz with your server&#39;s name, please do pay attention as some of them are links.
Search welcome, edit the welcome message.
For the now that is all you will be doing as im not going to tell you how to add minigames etc, REFER to other guide&#39;s for that sort of thing. Im only telling you how to get it running.

	Portforwording
Firstly, not all routers are capable of portforwording, i.e. mines. Google your router model and find out the specifications of it if your portforwording doesn&#39;t work.
I have made a youtube guide on how to do it the link is : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG4jhVn9SiM
Please run utorrent/bittorent after you run the source(cba explaining why lol).


	Setting up your webclient
Upload your jar file to your file manager.
Then, add in the html (link, copy n paste the code in. http://pastebin.com/qBAkfdbJ ) to the page you want your webclient on(must be html enabled) and substatute the information i&#39;ve put in with yours i.e. the title. Make sure your jar name is client (full name with extention client.jar).


	Misc
Their are MANY amazing free website providers, however overall I would say www.webs.com is the best as your allowed to host your webclient with them and you can have forums.
www.webs.com DO limit you alot however when you start of you don&#39;t need more than a forum&#39;s and webclient to be perfectly honest.
I will be improving this guide alot over time but I just thought I&#39;d post this just now to see if people want to know this sort of thing, I am NOT a pro programmer or anything, if anything im a noob compared to a lot of people but I want to help people improve as I feel their isn&#39;t enough people helping :(.

Credits:
Maker of hybrid pvp v3 client 20%
Ric914 5% for teaching me how to make to jar and sign(through his webclient guide)
Loveandpower for his jarring and signing guide 20%
Maker of erasedpkz for 20% the work he did on source(1% to me for my work and rest to maker of hybrid-pvp)
5% for me actualy making the guide(I need to tidy it up but cba atm will do later, unless someone else wants to do for me:D?)
Rest of credits to the lovely people that put up guides which improved my knowledge!
Yeah, the guide gets crappier is it goes on, im quite lazy will improve it if people give me a thumbs up though.</description>

<p>Thanks guys, next time I make a guide(will not remake and improve this due to it already being posted most probibly a lot better) it’ll be far more detailed.<br>
Hopefully it’ll help someone as that was the aim or I wouldn’t have done a guide for new programmers :3.</p>

              <p>[Before we start this is a rough copy please tell me what needs to be edited]<br>
Hello moparscape(please tell me what needs editing),</p>
<p>This is my guide on how to set up a fully functioning RSPS.<br>
What I will help you with(by either referring you to a detailed guide made by another Moparscape user or by myself)<br>
-How to setup your source(Erased-Pkz source with a few edits done by myself, just started the source as time goes by this will be edited more and more)<br>
-How to setup your client (Hybrid-Pvp v3)<br>
-How to setup a webclient(do love’s guide to change the webclient ready client I have provided to the jar file <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,490803.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,490803.0.html</a>)<br>
-Downloading and setting up JDK<br>
-The absolute basics(I mean minimilistic)<br>
-portforwarding(utorrent, bittorent way)</p>
<ul>
<li>more which I can’t be assed saying haha <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
(If their is more required please tell me and I’ll most likely add it in]</li>
</ul>
<p>Difficulty = 1/10<br>
Quality of guide currently(reveiwed by myself) = 4/10<br>
Time needed = N/A, Depends on your speed minimum time most likely an hour<br>
Will help be given? = Yes, if I can help you I will unless its something like ‘Can you please setup my server via teamviwer’<br>
I will only talk about the source and client I provide but you can obviously use abit of common sense and change the value’s to search etc.<br>
Misc info : Server runs on port 5555 not 43594(edit it if you want)<br>
always keep backups before editing.<br>
Click the photo’s to make them larger.</p>
<p>Please improve your server as your future community(or current) will want updates.</p>
<p>Okay now we shall start:)</p>
<p>Step one<br>
Setting up JDK(please skip if you already know how to setup, if you cannot use JDK sorry but quite frankly you can’t do RSPS unless a friend compilers for you)</p>
<p>What is JDK?</p>
<p>JDK stands for Java developers kit, its a programme that allows you to edit Java.</p>
<p>You download JDK at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u26-download-400750.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u26-download-400750.html</a> (take note of the jdk you have)</p>
<p>The red circle is for 32bit user’s and blue for 64bit users <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/96/jdk.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/2789/jdk.th.png" alt width="" height=""></a><br>
To find out what type you are (32bit or 64bit) click the window’s start up button(left hand corner). Then right hand click ‘computer’, then click properties <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/9/systemtype.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/9039/systemtype.th.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Download the approriate JDK file, and agree to everything and let it install (its a 76mb file roughly so it wont take long).</p>
<pre><code>	Setting up your client
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, in ideal condition’s you’ll get a source and client that match but as im sure most of the amazing source’s you would like to use have anti-leach’s or whatever stopping you from using them or something… I would reccomend using the source and client(webclient ready) I provide.</p>
<p>First of all download the client( <a href="http://up.ht/mJMHII" rel="nofollow noopener">http://up.ht/mJMHII</a> ).<br>
Okay, if you do not already have winrar(needed to decompress the file and return it to its normal state) the 32bit download is here : <a href="http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-32-bit/3000-2250_4-10007677.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-32-bit/3000-2250_4-10007677.html</a> 64bit here : <a href="http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-64-bit/3000-2250_4-10965579.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-64-bit/3000-2250_4-10965579.html</a> (install it obviously).<br>
When you open the file it’ll look like this <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/862/compress.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img862.imageshack.us/img862/9987/compress.th.png" alt width="" height=""></a>, press the ‘extract to’ option then click desktop(now its on your desktop).</p>
<p>Open the folder, right click the edit option on the compiler, <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/143/compiler.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/6058/compiler.th.png" alt width="" height=""></a> now change the highlighted number to your JDK version.<br>
Now your compiler is running, after you do any edits you need to run your compiler for your edits to take place. A compiler converts Java files to Class files. Basically Java files is the file we read and the .class files are the files that computers read. The compiler basically translates it to a language the computer can understand.</p>
<p>I know for a fact you want to change the name of the server in the client (hit ctrl and f at the same time if your using windows xp) search for Cookie-Pkz. Three .Java files should pop-up, the first one is client.java . Try to open it, if your new to this your PC will ask you how you want to open it. Open it with either Notepad (or download netbeans and use that).<br>
Hit(on your keyboard) ctrl and h at the same time. In the ‘find what’ bar type in cookie-pkz , in the replace with bar place in the disired name for your server).<br>
Do the same for your gui.java file, do not do this for the cachedownloader.java file!!<br>
Remember to save these files, now compile.<br>
You should not get any errors, if you do you may post them on this thread for someone to help but I reccomend redoing as it wont take long to redo and it is an error on your behalf!<br>
You have now successfully changed the name of your webclient ready client. Please do edit this in the future though.</p>
<pre><code>	Changing the name of your cache(skip this if your not bothered about it as no-one really looks)
</code></pre>
<p>Firstly, download dropbox from this link : <a href="http://www.dropbox.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.dropbox.com</a><br>
Install it yadayada, its simple enough…<br>
Run your client and allow it to download the cache, it shouldn’t take too long its a large DSPK cache but its not that large(100mbs estimate).<br>
Rename your cache(to find it, click windows start button/computer/boot c then you’ll see a ‘cookie-pkz’ file.<br>
Right click the file and click add to archive. Use the archive file format .rar(in blue) compression method, best(red) <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/862/compress.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img862.imageshack.us/img862/9987/compress.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Uploaded with <a href="http://imageshack.us" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ImageShack.us</a> then click ok.<br>
Run your dropbox file then click the ‘public’ folder and put the cache in there. Let the cache upload(takes me 20minutes but my internet speed is TERRIBLE).<br>
Right click the file once uploaded, hover over the dropbox word and then click ‘copy public link’.<br>
Now go onto the cachedownloader.java file and search ‘<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31360318/Cookie-Pkz.zip" rel="nofollow noopener">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31360318/Cookie-Pkz.zip</a>’, delete it and click paste so your cache link is their, keep doing untill your pc can’t find the link again.<br>
Save file, compile.<br>
You may delete the ‘cookie-pkz’ cache in your c drive now, run your client so your cache downloads (or place your cache in the c drive).<br>
Make another copy of your client, keep one for yourself and one for your players. Leave one as is for yourself(do not if your using a vps or dedicated server, the one with the ip you obtained from <a href="http://whatismyip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">whatismyip.org</a> will be the one your players use so upload that for your webclient).<br>
(adding in this part)<br>
Their are commands like ::vote that makes a popup search <a href="http://www.cookie-pkz.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.cookie-pkz.com</a> and replace with your website or leave out till later)</p>
<pre><code>	Setting the ip (for youself and players)
</code></pre>
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.whatsmyip.org</a> and copy the ip it says is yours (example, not mines btw 97.438.529.619).<br>
In the second client search for 0.0.0.0 and replace it with the your ip or your vps or dedicated server (should be in the client.java and gui.java files).<br>
Save and compile, you will need this for later.</p>
<pre><code>	Setting up your source(not detailed as theirs so much!!)
</code></pre>
<p>The source is already up to date(duel and a very few other things are bugged gonna fix after done guide will remove this and update links when fixed) but you will want to change your welcome message etc.<br>
Download link :<br>
This is where the search bar comes in handy also remember to set your jdk version in the ‘memleak(fixed)’ fie and ‘compiler’ (scroll up if you can’t remember what to change).<br>
Search Commands, click the commands.java file and search ‘fringie’ and replace it with the name your going to use ingame.<br>
Now search for the names ‘fringie’, 'Maddy, ‘Rhino’ and replace them with your name. Please may attention to what its saying, for example theirs a line that says Rhino is a super donater, by replacing it and not paying attention you’d be saying your the super donater(in the news announcements).<br>
save, compile.<br>
Now search Cookie-pkz, open the files that comes up and search Cookie-pkz in the files then 'cookie-pkz with your server’s name, please do pay attention as some of them are links.<br>
Search welcome, edit the welcome message.<br>
For the now that is all you will be doing as im not going to tell you how to add minigames etc, REFER to other guide’s for that sort of thing. Im only telling you how to get it running.</p>
<pre><code>Portforwording
</code></pre>
<p>Firstly, not all routers are capable of portforwording, i.e. mines. Google your router model and find out the specifications of it if your portforwording doesn’t work.<br>
I have made a youtube guide on how to do it the link is : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG4jhVn9SiM" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG4jhVn9SiM</a><br>
Please run utorrent/bittorent after you run the source(cba explaining why lol).</p>
<pre><code>Setting up your webclient
</code></pre>
<p>Upload your jar file to your file manager.<br>
Then, add in the html (link, copy n paste the code in. <a href="http://pastebin.com/qBAkfdbJ" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pastebin.com/qBAkfdbJ</a> ) to the page you want your webclient on(must be html enabled) and substatute the information i’ve put in with yours i.e. the title. Make sure your jar name is client (full name with extention client.jar).</p>
<pre><code>Misc
</code></pre>
<p>Their are MANY amazing free website providers, however overall I would say <a href="http://www.webs.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.webs.com</a> is the best as your allowed to host your webclient with them and you can have forums.<br>
<a href="http://www.webs.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.webs.com</a> DO limit you alot however when you start of you don’t need more than a forum’s and webclient to be perfectly honest.<br>
I will be improving this guide alot over time but I just thought I’d post this just now to see if people want to know this sort of thing, I am NOT a pro programmer or anything, if anything im a noob compared to a lot of people but I want to help people improve as I feel their isn’t enough people helping :(.</p>
