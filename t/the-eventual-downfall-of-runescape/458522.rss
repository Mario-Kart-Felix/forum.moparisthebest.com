    <title>The Eventual Downfall of RuneScape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-eventual-downfall-of-runescape/458522</link>
    <description>So, IF RuneScape was to end, how do you think it would happen? What would be the cause of this? My opinion:

Jagex continues and insists on creating updates that people strongly disagree with. In fact, the number of people who disagree with said updates vastly outnumber the ones who agree with, support, and want more content like it. There will always be new players who are unaware of how the game used to be, but eventually Jagex will release new games. If Jagex releases a high quality game (LOL!), continuing on their current path, and not listening to their community, then yes. I believe that they will eventually close the RuneScape databases and take it offline. I believe that the new C.E.O. of RuneScape is the worst thing to ever happen to the game. I of course DO hope that this happens, because R.S.P.S. will become evermore popular, and we might actually get somewhere then. A game really starts to go downhill when the original people lose their passion for their own creation.

If you believe that Jagex would never close down RuneScape, even if they were going in debt because of it? Jagex is VERY money hungry - exactly like a company should be. This is however NOT how game creators should be (see Modern Warfare rehashes). Jagex would shut down RuneScape the INSTANT that they started losing money because of it. This would not be the case had Andrew Gower not left. It has been proven multiple times that Jagex owns some of the Gold Selling websites (NO THEY DIDN&#39;T BUY THEM TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM SELLING GOLD). These were active sites operated by Jagex.

Sighh, 1. maybe your not worth the time it would take the make a good debate.</li>
<li>Age doesn’t mean much considering a lot of my friends are 20 year olds (if your not aware at college you mix with older people if your my age) and I’m much smarter than a fair few of them so I do not see where your coming to the conclusion that you would infact be smarter than me. You couldn’t even be wiser than me, the age difference is too small and this is not 50 years ago. Information is easily accessible.</li>
<li>Business is fairly common sense and I did a course in Business previously to the Computing courses I have and am currently doing.</li>
<li>I have already looked into it (business, not Jagex selling gold because thats common sense that they don’t), you can’t even analyse peoples posts so even if I hadn’t looked into it then I would not take your word.</li>

              <p>That explains why Jagex has been taking down accounts that have had huge gold transactions on them. Either they are trying to wipe gold out of the community so more people will buy more gold or they might even be concerned by the overall economy.</p>

              <p>No but really though, the game is NOT what it used to be, and I finally agree with Frell. Runescape has gone to shit. It doesn’t matter how many times I try to play it now (I’ve tried like ~6 different times), I can’t get into like I did. The game is so messed up now it’s nothing how it was. Not even the content, not the community, but how the game operates as a whole. There first and worst mistake was taking away free trade, which lead to the release of Pvp, which lead to a <span class="bbcode-b">huge</span> amount of gold and items being poured into the economy. The bots ruined every type of skilling there is, nothing is fun to work for anymore (there isn’t any competition between players of rank). Skills are too easy to train, and money is too easy to gain. It’s nothing how I enjoyed in my time of playing Runescape.</p>
<p>p.s I’m not going to back and fix any grammar mistakes in this post, I’m tired and I just wrote a college essay</p>

<p>Or this is what they want for RuneScape. This would make sense though if they were afraid a game might flop.</p>
