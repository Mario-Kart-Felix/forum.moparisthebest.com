    <title>I need some last minute help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-some-last-minute-help/515905</link>
    <description>I know this is a pain in the ass request but I&#39;m on a time limit.
Here is the situation:

Today is my last day at this job because I found another one that I start Monday. It is 12:00 PM Central time now and I need to have this site finished by 3.
The only thing that I need help with is a page that will allow someone to upload a photo to a DB and another page to display it. It doesn&#39;t matter if it may be broken in a month or if it&#39;s even secure.

If anyone has the time to help with that much I would seriously appreciate it. I learned today why procrastination is bad :p</description>
