    <description>Hi, monitoring events :)

You have done what I asked: You have choosen leaders. Good Work!

I will give my SQL database to the new community, since it is a collaberate effort of us all and thus not mine to keep. I will be fully cooperative and provide assistance where needed. 

I would advice you to choose more Administrators. Dank and Wizz cant handle events on their own, simply because it is a HELL of a lot of work and they are tied up and they should stay that way. I trust you will divide tasks and stick to those.

Also, I would love to see you keep the SRL Forum-rules as they are, since I consider those my &quot;intellectual property&quot; and with it I unlocked a tremendeous amount of positive creative energy. It will also keep you out of trouble :)

As for the SVN: Yes, keep it Open-Source. Remove the auto-responder if neccesary, or better yet: empty the autoresponder, so you only need to copy paste for private purposes.

P.S.

[eager to tell] I archieved an [b]Ultimate Low Score[/b] during the comedytrain event. I was banned [b]5[/b] times within 35 minutes and I had some interesting conversations with 4 (!) Golden Mods. Appearently the [b]all[/b] knew about me being WT-Fakawi and unleashed their frustration on me personally...  I wrote an appeal and the next day (Monday at exactly 09:06) I was unbanned. Thanks Andrew for the respect!

So: I archieved my last goal and proved that Jagex closely monitors development throughout the [b]entire [/b]cheating community. It is offcourse a logical thing to do. Know thy enemies. Example: They changed the Box a bit (tiny offset in numbers) so appearently they had pups code!
But in a strange way Jagex seems to respect us too (see above). Though a fragile agreement, it provides some gentleman space to operate. Keep it like that!!!!!!!!!!!![/eager to tell]

No I am not coming back, but I promise to &quot;stick around&quot;. I will post each and every script I ever made on the new SRL-Board.

L,

TW-Fawaki erm... Drissyweer.</description>

But it somewhat concerns me that Jagex had gotten pups’ code, there are only 2 possible explanations for that…<br>
1 They for it from the nex svn from the first revision…<br>
2 We have a spy (I prefered the first possibility tough)</p>
<p>PS: I do have an idea that could solve or partially solve the problem with the opensourceness…<br>
As prolly no one of you know, I’m very good at writing encryption algorythms (or whatever you spell it), I could (try to) make a program we can use to encrypt files like the autoresponder before we upload em<br>
We can for example give them the extension *.scarenc and make my program it’s default which will decrypt it, save it as a temp scar file somewhere and open it in scar, then we can modify what we want, save it make the program encrypt it and recommit it.</p>
