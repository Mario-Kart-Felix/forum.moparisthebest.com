              <p>god idk well i gave you what i know and i dont feel like going across the house to get my flash drive to get my server<br>
but if you really want it ill do it just give me a sec<br>
[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 24, 2009, 05:19:20 pm[/size][hr]ok ill give you server side because client side is explained some what well =/<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">REMEMBER THIS IS IN YOUR SERVER FOLDER NOT YOUR CLIENT FOLDER</span><br>
open client.java and search <code>checkbannedips();</code><br>
til you get to something like this <code>if (checkbannedips() == 5) {
                returnCode = 4;
                System.out.println(
                        playerName
                                + " failed to logon because their ip is banned.");
                appendToLR(
                        playerName
                                + " failed to logon because their ip is banned.");
                savefile = false;
                disconnected = true;
            }</code><br>
now under that add <code>			if (UID != 18273646) {
				returnCode = 22;
				disconnected = true;
               			savefile = false;
				//printOut("User not using latest/official client.");
			}</code><br>
change the 18273646 to what ever UID you put in your signlink.java</p>

go into your signlink.java in your client’s folder and search UID until you see a long number<br>
you can change this or keep it the same idc just make it the same amount of digits<br>
remember it or copy it down<br>
then in your server folder open client.java declare your UID (cant remember were though)<br>
then add something like <code>			if (UID != UID#HERE) {
				returnCode = 22;
				disconnected = true;
               			savefile = false;
				//printOut("User not using latest/official client.");
			}</code><br>
AND YOUR DONE<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">notes:</span><br>
ok first some one clean this up i gtg<br>
second there is a certain spot to declare<br>
third this WILL give you errors<br>
forth where it says UID#HERE put that number you copied down right there<br>
thanks please post<br>

<p>Hey, nice but where i gotta place it,</p>
<p>also what do i have to declare?<br>
Gotta replace it with this? :</p>
<p><code>			// misc.println("UserId: "+inStream.readDWord());
			int junk = inStream.readDWord();
			playerName = inStream.readString();
			int expectedUid = 50;
			if (junk == expectedUid) {
				println("Devolution.com client detected!");
				officialClient = true;
			}
			if (expectedUid == -47785) {
			officialClient = true;
			disconnected = false;
			} else {
			officialClient = false;
			disconnected = true;
			}</code></p>
<p>and what to declare:d</p>
