    <title>Free PS3 Conga - Currently cooper - giving free rs account ;)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/free-ps3-conga-currently-cooper-giving-free-rs-account/202382</link>
    <description>EDIT:
Note: To get started, register under cooper&#39;s link [
http://www.YourPS34free.com/index.php?ref=4988720].
On May 10th, someone will take his place, then the next referrer, and so on.
Note:
If you would like to &quot;trade&quot; for referrals, you can do so. I will give a free runescape account to the [b]6th[/b] referral I get from here.
[quote=&quot;ThAt0n36Uy&quot;]Well let me register then...

Just a quick overview of the registration process. You must give valid information to receive your prize. You can change your address after you register, so if you complete your referrals and want it shipped to a certain address you can do so. Or an address to which you have access too. There is a page you reach which asks you if you would like to be an ad completer, or referral completer. Choose the Referral one. And that&#39;s about it.[/quote]

Niall has given permission, as long as it does not get out of hand.
Who will be going first?

I was wondering if anyone would like to participate in a ps3 gift conga. If you want to be sure I&#39;m not attempting a scam just to get one for myself, I won&#39;t go first, and a respected member of the community could go first. Also, if this is against the rules, I will close it. It will use yourps34free.com
[b][u]WHAT IS A CONGA?[/u][/b]
A conga [line] is a way of getting referrals for free sites. The way it works is that the person who is currently going will have their referral ID posted in this message, and anyone who wants to participate in the conga signs up under them. They will stay up on top for a week, or until they get 10 referrals.

[b][u][u]IS THIS SITE A SCAM?[/u][/u][/b]
I wasn&#39;t sure myself, but it has had a lot of good reviews.

<p>Neither do I. Hyperzosin appears to be free, as does overnight genius. <a href="http://Stamps.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Stamps.com</a>, The Amazon Diet, and Video professor look free, but if you saw them not to be, they probably aren’t. I’ll try them when I have some free time.

That is world wide, if it is okay with anyone who is already registered, maybe we can switch. If not, maybe pay your friends a small amount of money for their referrals? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Just a quick overview of the registration process. You must give valid information to receive your prize. You can change your address after you register, so if you complete your referrals and want it shipped to a certain address you can do so. Or an address to which you have access too. There is a page you reach which asks you if you would like to be an ad completer, or referral completer. Choose the Referral one. And that’s about it.</p>
