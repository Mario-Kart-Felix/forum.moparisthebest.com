    <title>Cannabis resin?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cannabis-resin/397369</link>
    <description>So yesterday me and 2 friends got an 8th, it was pretty dry.

I had a few pipe hits but wasn&#39;t feeling much.

I was ripping/crushing it up (no grinder:() to go into a few 1 skin blunts and when I had finished I had a load of green sticky shit on my finger tips, which took ages to get off, could this have gotten me high? I was very stoned compared to the other 2 friends of mine after a blunt or 2 who had the same amount f cannabis as I did.

My question: can the resin on my hands make me higher? If so I&#39;ll be crushing the herb up again :p</description>

<p>As for a topical solution, the only way that the cannabinoids could possibly become active topically is if the plant was soaked in alcohol or turned into a balm/lotion.  However, the solution would aid medically for the specific area, it has no effect on your brain and there is no high.  I’d just say you got nicely toasted then thought “OMFG IT WAS MY HANDS MENG”</p>

              <p>I’ve never heard of the term “hairs” being used for trichomes, however I have heard the term used to describe the pollen collecting part of a female marijuana plant.</p>
<p>As for resin, although it is technically the same resin which is referenced in “resin-production” through a plants growth cycle (ie. trichomes) it is most often referred to (atleast around here) as the black “resin” found in for example a pipe, or along the tip of a joint or in a heavily used bong.  This black, tar like substance will infact get you high, but is also famed for its common residual effects of short lasting high and headache.</p>

<p>Yeah they don’t look like that to the human eye though, and I think chrisn was just pointing out that trichomes are not “colloquially known as hairs.”</p>
<p>What is colloquially known as hairs on marijuana, are the larger brown/yellow/orange/red hairs found on the plant and/or buds.<br>
