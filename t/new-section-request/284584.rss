    <title>New section request</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-section-request/284584</link>
    <description>A lot of people complain about Winterlove based private servers, lately I have been trying to change this by releasing new servers that are a lot better than Current Winterlove servers. I have also released that other people are trying to do the same.

I am here to request a new private server section, or atleast a Download section for RS2D servers as Rs2D server don&#39;t get as much attention as they did before and hopefully we can change this. Please leave thoughts and comments on this.


[b]Please add a new private server section for Rs2D based private servers.[/b]</description>

It doesn’t matter how much more advanced Rs2D is over wL, they are both Rs2 Private Servers.<br>

<p>Anyway, I’d say no. They’re both RSPS, and for the same deob. If someone actually wants to learn Java, then they’d move on to something else other than RSPS. RS2D may be complicated, but there’s much more Java can do.</p>

Anyways I would love to have a new section, so I guess I support this?</p>

<p>I understand that, but the Rs2D server is far more well created than wL, I would like to see members of moparscape start learning about Java instead of spoon licking.</p>
