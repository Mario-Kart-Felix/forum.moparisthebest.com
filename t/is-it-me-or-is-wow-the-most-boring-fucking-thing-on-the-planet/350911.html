        <p>So i finally tried it out, and after doing the beginning quests to reach a decent level and started trying the very small range of PvP bgs i realized how pointless and <em>fucking</em> boring it was. You do a shitload of quests that all result in nothing. You kill something, get a reward, buy better stuff to kill the next something with and so on. An online game has meaning to me if its competitive with other people (ie unlocking shit and beating the hell out of other people with it), but WoW somehow escaped this by creating a very small pvp system and making everything take forever to get. My only slight motivation to keep playing past level 11 was to get a mount. So to save myself the time i said “whats the point”, alt+f4 and came here to start ranting.</p>
<p>Note: this isnt a rant on me comparing WoW to runescape and saying rs is better. Its more of a why cant i find jack shit to do on WoW but there was always stuff to do on rs.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I now am liable to form my opinion in saying      runescape    kicks    WoW’s    ass. (I no longer play rs btw) Runescape wins because it has a much more wide variety of safe PvP games where you can safely flaunt your new items. Quite fairly to, with the exception of the gs. It gives you motivation to do quests. A level 40 asks “Wow, how do you do that??”  reply: “Oh, this? Its a spell you get from the quest desert treasure.” Boom, right there. That level 40 now has one more thing to add to his list of stuff he wants to get and more of a reason to keep playing.</p>
<p>WoW and runescape are both pointless and boring, but runescape succeeds in holding my attention much longer.</p>
<p>How does someone waste their life on WoW? The damn thing doesnt hold your attention after you get past the new gameplay. Ill admit, this game was pretty decent at first. It was a great concept. Id love to fuck around with friends on wow but theres simply nothing left to do after 6 hours of playing. So if you play WoW, tell me what you do on it that makes you keep wasting $15 a month. Apparently im missing something.</p>

<p>WoW has better graphics, you DO unlock things (get professions, secondary professions, spells, achievements), PvP is actually skill and not just “click food, click person again”, etc. etc.</p>

(I no longer play rs btw) Runescape wins because it has a much more wide variety of safe PvP games where you can safely flaunt your new items. Quite fairly to, with the exception of the gs. It gives you motivation to do quests. A level 40 asks “Wow, how do you do that??”  reply: “Oh, this? Its a spell you get from the quest desert treasure.” Boom, right there. That level 40 now has one more thing to add to his list of stuff he wants to get and more of a reason to keep playing.</p>
<p>WoW and runescape are both pointless and boring, but runescape succeeds in holding my attention much longer.</p>
<p>How does someone waste their life on WoW? The damn thing doesnt hold your attention after you get past the new gameplay. Ill admit, this game was pretty decent at first. It was a great concept. Id love to fuck around with friends on wow but theres simply nothing left to do after 6 hours of playing. So if you play WoW, tell me what you do on it that makes you keep wasting $15 a month.[/quote]</p>
<p>PvP Realms; try them they you will like them.<br>
Get to Level 20 it becomes much more enjoyable.</p>

<p>At level 80, you can raid with 25 or 10 other people against an entire place of bosses which has waves, etc. etc. and past level 15 you’re able to use the Dungeon Finder for bosses as well. Of course, the beginner level bosses aren’t near as hard as when you keep going up, but it’s still fun.</p>
<p>You didn’t play near long enough to enjoy the game.</p>

        <p>Yeah I hate both those games too. Only 1 mmorpg that has ever really caught my interest and that is darkfall. You get thrown into a huge world with next to no direction on what to do or how to start, and you aren’t hand held like a retard throughout the whole game and told exactly what to do and that you’re the hero (lmfao) like every other mmorpg. You can kill anyone anywhere, there is no safe zones, full loot (lose EVERYTHING on you when you die,) it’s first person mage/archery and third person melee (no auto target.) The entire game is built around large scale combat over cities which players build up, there is also naval warfare and siege engines called warhulks.</p>
<p>It’s just so much fucking fun, best game ever if you don’t mind getting raped for the first month or so you play (or shorter if you have no life like I use to have) until you build up some skills and don’t mind losing all your shit when you die. Also the best thing about this game is since there is no levels or classes you can’t just look at who you’re fighting and know exactly what to expect or what you’re up against. That right there makes it the best for me, you always need to expect the unexpected. Just sucks that my gf moved in with me awhile back and I’m working full time now… I don’t get to much time to play that game anymore.</p>
<p>Here’s a couple videos, couldn’t find any recent ship combat vids, then again I’m to lazy to look right now lol</p>

<p>Here’s a little story of one of my favorite times in this game that 3 other people and I started… (Fucking AWESOME possibilities!) We went down to one of the most powerful clans hamlets (a small city and that clan was called scarebears) at the time and we wanted them to port in (recall back) to fight us but they wouldn’t. So we pulled out some siege hammers and battlespikes (grenades) and started smashing there shit, well we took out a few buildings and there bank and well they ported in and raped us. Later that night they sent about 15-20 people and started destroying our city so we called in our allies and we killed them. The next day we sent a force down to destroy the rest of there hamlet and had an amazing fight down there, both sides lost a ton of people but eventually we ended up losing in the end.</p>
<p>The next day that other clan had another clan which owed them a favor (forget there clan name now but they were the biggest clan on the server at the time) so they sent a ship to our coastal city and they started shooting down everything with there ship while scarebears came in our city and tried to destroy our buildings. We ended up pushing them out after a long fight, I think it lasted around 2 hours. So the next day we organized and came up with a plan and had our whole alliance come together to completely take out the biggest clan. So we went to there city, I think we had anywhere from 50-100 people and after a few hours there city was completely flattened and there clan ended up falling apart after that. To many inner issues with the clan leaders over the decisions they made the previous day and they split, so we ended up causing the biggest clan to fall off the game.</p>
<p>This is where I forget a lot of the details since it happened at the end of last year. During the next few days scarebears kept attacking our city and our alliance members cities and we just sort of held back and just defended our properties without going on the offensive. After that we went down to one of there cities (not the hamlet) and destroyed it and then we went down to there other city and took most of it out too. I also remember some of clan leaders in our alliance were trying to make a peace treaty with scarebears to end the fighting and that was why we didn’t retaliate for those few days. But they wouldn’t have any of it (which I’m fucking glad because the fights were so much fun…)</p>
<p>After that happened I think that was when scarebears fell apart, none of us ended up doing a siege (fight to take another clans city or hamlet) it was just an asset destruction war (destroying each others buildings without taking over the city.) In the end we had a couple weeks worth of fun (the game is always fun even when there isn’t city destruction to do) and ended up causing the biggest clan at the time and one of the most powerful clans (lots of power gamers in that clan like me at the time) to utterly fall in destruction… And this all started because of the actions of 3 other guys and me, and it ended up effecting 1000s of players in the game. Want to be a hero in this game like all the other mmorpgs constantly tell you that you are, then you have to fucking make a name for yourself and that’s what I love about this game. Doesn’t give you all that stupid false gratification, if you want that shit then you need to fucking earn it.</p>
<p>Also another interesting story… The clan I was in for the first 3 months I played also ended up fucking me over too, so I got them back really fucking good. I was always on, helped my clan and the other clans in our alliance defend against enemies every time, organized pvp tournaments and trips. Always helping everyone with questions and guiding people on how to do shit constantly… Anyways there was this one general in the clan who was always a dick to me for some reason, not sure what his issue was but every time I trained at a mob spawn he would try to take it from me or ninja the loot… So one day I was just fed up with his bullshit and he wasn’t talking to me on vent so I killed the fucker, looted his corpse and threw it all in a bag and put it in our clan bank so he could get it back…  (I should have kept it) Even put the shit in there that was my loot too, but no that wasn’t good enough for that arrogant little fuck so he called in a bunch of guild leaders from our alliance ventrilo and they came back to the spawn I was training at and tried to kill me… Luckily I was able to make it to the bank first and put everything in there so all I lost was a mount but then they proceeded to bind camp me (kill me over and over as I respawn at the place I was bound too.)</p>
<p>That really pissed me off so I just logged out after 20 min of that. Went on ventrilo later that night to try and talk to him and the guild leader and he said I was in the wrong and they demoted me so I wouldn’t have clan bank access anymore (they were rl friends or they gamed with each other before I think and they wouldn’t hear my side of the story and they shunned me from the clan and had everyone turn against me basically.) So I went on early the next morning, on my alt account which the dumbasses forgot to demote, so I just stole there entire clan bank and traded it to my main account and left a shield in there with a smiley face on it haha. Really sucks that it had to come down to this since I enjoyed playing with a lot of the guys in that clan, but that’s the fun of the game there is just so many possibilities… Never will I play another mmorpg unless it follows the same concept as darkfall online.</p>
