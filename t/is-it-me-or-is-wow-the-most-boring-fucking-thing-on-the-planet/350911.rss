    <title>Is it me or is WoW the most boring fucking thing on the planet?</title>

    <description>So i finally tried it out, and after doing the beginning quests to reach a decent level and started trying the very small range of PvP bgs i realized how pointless and _fucking_ boring it was. You do a shitload of quests that all result in nothing. You kill something, get a reward, buy better stuff to kill the next something with and so on. An online game has meaning to me if its competitive with other people (ie unlocking shit and beating the hell out of other people with it), but WoW somehow escaped this by creating a very small pvp system and making everything take forever to get. My only slight motivation to keep playing past level 11 was to get a mount. So to save myself the time i said &quot;whats the point&quot;, alt+f4 and came here to start ranting.

Note: this isnt a rant on me comparing WoW to runescape and saying rs is better. Its more of a why cant i find jack shit to do on WoW but there was always stuff to do on rs.

Surprisingly, I now am liable to form my opinion in saying      runescape    kicks    WoW&#39;s    ass. (I no longer play rs btw) Runescape wins because it has a much more wide variety of safe PvP games where you can safely flaunt your new items. Quite fairly to, with the exception of the gs. It gives you motivation to do quests. A level 40 asks &quot;Wow, how do you do that??&quot;  reply: &quot;Oh, this? Its a spell you get from the quest desert treasure.&quot; Boom, right there. That level 40 now has one more thing to add to his list of stuff he wants to get and more of a reason to keep playing.

WoW and runescape are both pointless and boring, but runescape succeeds in holding my attention much longer.

How does someone waste their life on WoW? The damn thing doesnt hold your attention after you get past the new gameplay. Ill admit, this game was pretty decent at first. It was a great concept. Id love to fuck around with friends on wow but theres simply nothing left to do after 6 hours of playing. So if you play WoW, tell me what you do on it that makes you keep wasting $15 a month. Apparently im missing something.</description>

In retrospect, ALL games are pointless, because they do nothing for your IRL, unless they have some kinda hidden RL reward when you get to a certain point.</p>
<p>I agree though, WoW is a very boring game, but that is because there really is no chatting going on there like on others that I play. I’m more of a social gaming person, so it just seemed too quiet to me.</p>

<p>Yes, Runescape is more realistic than WoW. All you fucking do in WoW is kill shit, rather than in RS you’re given more story based tasks and the choice of what-- like 13 different skills to train?

<p>Btw, i play on a famous private server called bloodcraft which is EXACTLY like the blizzard server and has about 700-900 people online daily, if anyone wants to join me pm me and ill tell you how you can play on it. So no monthly payments and still a pretty large population :)[/quote]</p>

              <p>[quote=“Frell, post:43, topic:350911”]I tried WoW again and it seems a little better, i can play daily but it definitely doesnt hold me as long as rs did.</p>
<p>Btw, i play on a famous private server called bloodcraft which is EXACTLY like the blizzard server and has about 700-900 people online daily, if anyone wants to join me pm me and ill tell you how you can play on it. So no monthly payments and still a pretty large population :)[/quote]yeah babe tell me, ill play with you sometime.</p>
