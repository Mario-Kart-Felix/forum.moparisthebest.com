    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-to-talk-to-moparisthebest-important/514088</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve sent him several pm&#39;s about an issue I had, and would appreciate it if one of you with better contact could help me get him to take care of it.

This is about the Sponsored Servers spot which I&#39;ve bidded on and bought SEVERAL times.

My account was compromised and I plan to continue to bid for the #1 spot for a long time.

I supplied sufficient proof via PM to him and other information regarding the situation.  

I would really appreciate it if this message could get forwarded to him.

Thank you!</description>

I was sure that only Moparisthebest could edit who could and couldn’t use the status page due to the fact that all the payments for it go through him, if someone never paid him and him alone could move the user into a certain group and remove that user, I may be wrong there. It’s worth sending a PM to Tom or Taharok though.</p>
