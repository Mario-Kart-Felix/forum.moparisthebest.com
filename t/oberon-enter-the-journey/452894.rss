    <title>Oberon | Enter the Journey</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/oberon-enter-the-journey/452894</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! I&#39;m the Head developer of Oberon and we are preparing out server for BETA tomorrow. We already have a nice staff team set up along with a development team -- an almost complete development team that is. We currently have two developers -- myself and MajorPro; however, we are in need of a web developer. The only standards we have for this position are the following:

[ul][li]You must understand common web programming languages: Javascript, Perl, PHP, etc. (We do not require that you know them all, but at least a basic understanding)[/li]
	[li]You must be dedicated to the team; If we require something to be done, it would be best if you could do it as soon as possible[/li]
	[li]You must be friendly/cooperative; We don&#39;t want anyone who is going to be a pain to work with[/li][/ul]
Our current team is fun and easy to work with, so we hope any future applicants are the same! If you are interested in this position and would like to check out our Development thread, please check here: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,532583.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,532583.0.html[/url]


Curious about our preparation for our BETA release tomorrow? Read below:


We currently have a web host with a domain, so we do have a forum and such prepared for the event. We also have a server ready, however we are still working on some of the configuration, which is a process in the BETA stage. The only serious thing that denies our preparation for BETA release tomorrow is the fact that we are in dire need of a web developer. Currently, I understand enough to get by, however I don&#39;t have the time nor patience for something I&#39;m not experienced with as much as others might be. I, along with MajorPro, are currently working on implementing key content to the server, which requires every bit of time we can stake into the server. I just recently got a job, so my time has been limited. I do hope any interested web developers understand the position we are currently in and do not take this as reference to future matters that may occur. [b]In other words, poop happens! [/b] :P 


If you have any questions/comments, feel free to post below.


[b]EDIT: We are also in need of a client developer, which seems to be more urgent than the web developer at the moment. If you would like to apply for either, please do post below.[/b]


[b]Application Format:[/b]
What position would you like to apply for? (Client/Web)
Why have you taken an interest in this team?
Have you ever had any type of team based experiences?
What web programming languages are you currently familiar/experienced with?
Will you stay with this team or are you going to hop from team to team?</description>
