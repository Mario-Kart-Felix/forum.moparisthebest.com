<p>So pretty much fudge your new players, good job Jagex.[/quote]<br>
Actually, they’ve been adding a lot of content for players of all levels lately.</p>
<p>What that message basically states is, “We know our veteran players are bored as hell, so we’re adding new shit for them”.</p>
<p>I’m not even comp’d on runescape, and I get bored because I’ve just done the grind for so long, I just don’t want to.</p>

              <p>Another good idea they have that will turn out shitty…</p>
<p>I’ve seriously stopped expecting any “good content” from jagex lately.<br>
It’s all rushed and half assed.<br>
Sure it looks pretty, but it doesn’t matter how it looks if there’s 300 bugs making it unplayable.</p>
<blockquote>Does this mean that we're not getting new regular skills or 120 skills?
<p>They’re definitely still on the cards! 120 skills are something that we’re still interested in doing in the future. If you guys still want 120 skills then we will continue having the discussion - with you and among ourselves - on whether they’re the right thing for the game. Elite skills do not rule out the possibility of raising existing skills to 120.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fucking knew this would happen. I knew they would eventually discuss (And will, guaranteed) changing the level cap from 99 to 120.</p>
