    <title>Adding clip to Npc&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-clip-to-npcs/258317</link>
    <description>Hey first of all, thanks for reading this and trying to help me out, I really appreciate it.
Second of all, I noticed that the the npcs on my server are able to ignore the walls and other boundaries, similar to the ::noclip command.

Anyway... I&#39;m using a deltascape based server (that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m a leecher...) and I&#39;d like to know how to add this small but crucial point in the server.

Thanks,
Mod Whip
