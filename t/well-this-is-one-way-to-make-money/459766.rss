<p>I’m sorry, but there is no way in hell that there are more people that will come back than there were bots. Jagex is DEFINITELY losing money over this. People don’t even realize that the majority of bots were not people you see botting for 99s, most of them were just suicide botters for rsgp. Also the damage of bots has already been done for people that cared about them (ie, people that thought training became pointless), because the stats have already been gained and it probably wont balance out for years (if ever).</p>

Also the damage of bots has already been done for people that cared about them (ie, people that thought training became pointless), because the stats have already been gained and it probably wont balance out for years (if ever).</p>

<p>a company looking to make a profit? how fucking absurd</p>

</aside>
<p>When you go against what your community wants, it’s absurd. You’d think they’d make more money and have better credibility if they stuck with the community more than the investors.<br>
[/quote]they don’t have the say so, as the investors are the majority share holders they must do what they wish</p>

<p>I love this comment too, what makes you guys think the investors have any input to the game design?  a person that invests in stock <span class="bbcode-b">generally</span> does not have input in how the company operates.</p>

<p>If you control over 50% you do have an input.[/quote]<br>
You have the choice. They would not get involved in game design as they are not game designers and they could lose money if they make bad decisions. They most likely told Jagex to introduce microtransactions and this is what Jagex did. I have trouble picturing a group of businessmen saying to add a spinning wheel owned by a goblin</p>
