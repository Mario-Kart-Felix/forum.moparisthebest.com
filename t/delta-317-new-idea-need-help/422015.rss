    <title>[delta][317]NEW IDEA! need help :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-317-new-idea-need-help/422015</link>
    <description>hey i was thinking. is there any way to make a command like &quot;::newclient&quot; that would link you to a website like for example &quot;mediafire.com&quot; so players can get the newest client easily. but heres the thing. it would have to be server sided so that you can actualy put in an acurate url. 

like if it was client sided (like all of the ::vote commands are) you would not be able to put in the right url cause you wouldnt know the url till you uploaded it. 

any ideas guys. 
i change things on my server everyday and i figured this would be easier than just making a command that would open a &quot;sendQuest&quot; interface like all of my ::rules and ::news commands are.</description>

<p>Or you can just write a Java program to auto-update their client when there is a client, and you can do this using a UID inside the client, rejecting their connection with an out-dated version of your client.</p>

<p>yeah thats to complicated <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> i just started learning to code about 2 months ago. im about as green as they come as far as new coders. im just doing this server to learn and to play around. i wanna try to stick to my idea i think that would be alot simpler and something i need to learn.</p>
