    <title>Item search command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/item-search-command/335384</link>
    <description>I am using a 508 Espeon based source and i was just wondering, is it possible to add a command which would list all item names with their item id next to them, even changed item names, like i have donator items on my server and will it come up because alot of people are asking me for item ids.
Thank you soo much.</description>

You would have to make the command your self. . .and all the ids wouldnt fit on 1 command list.</p>
