For Reclaimer&#39;s mod menu you do not even need a JTAG. All you need is XTAF Explorer v17 and a usb/flash drive.You can find the xtaf explorer here..
http://www.mediafire.com/?4sspvzzuvvvwf4l

First you plug your flash drive into your xbox
Second thing you need to do is start up World at War, then when it starts up something should pop and then say select device select usb or flash drive which ever.and then when you get to the main menu click on &quot;SOLO&quot; then when you do that click on save &amp; quit when it starts up.
Thirdly you need put your usb into your laptop/pc then start up xtaf explorer v17.. Then click file and then open device then find your save game and delete it, then you need to do is select inject file then inject the modded .svg into xtaf.
Then click file close device. after that plug your usb into your xbox and then start up world at war then select usb again, start up solo again then go play some zombies and you should have it.. 

Controls to mod menu

Back opens mod menu up, dpad up and down cycles through different mods/sections. press &quot;A&quot; to select mod/section. then that&#39;s pretty much it.

My mod menu is copyrighted.</description>
