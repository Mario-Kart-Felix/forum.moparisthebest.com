    <title>$3 million in drugs seized from high-tech pot bunker</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;RCMP in Chilliwack, B.C., are boasting the biggest marijuana grow-op bust in the city&#39;s history - with $3 million worth of crops seized Wednesday morning.

At 8:00 a.m., RCMP officers and members of the Lower Mainland Emergency Response Team stormed a sophisticated underground drug bunker, located beneath a home on the 7600-block of Nixon Road.

The facility contained security cameras, a hidden hydraulic elevator lift and even bear spray-emitting booby traps rigged to surprise intruders.

&quot;It&#39;s highly fortified. Very hard to find, and certainly they knew what they were doing,&quot; Cpl. Lea-Anne Dunlop said.

One 61-year-old suspect was arrested at the property. He is not known to police, but remains in custody as the investigation continues.

&quot;While we cannot confirm any links to organized crime at this point, the level of sophistication of this grow-op suggests many people were involved,&quot; Dunlop said in a statement released Thursday.

Authorities say the massive crop of more than 11,500 plants was sustained by water irrigated from a nearby creek. Officials also estimate $400,000 worth of Hydro power had been stolen to power the facility.

Police say chemicals were being dumped back on to the property, but the environmental impact is not yet known.

Anyone with information on this, or any other drug operation in B.C., is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
