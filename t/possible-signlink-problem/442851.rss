    <title>Possible signlink problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/possible-signlink-problem/442851</link>
    <description>Hello,
Basically, when I try to download the cache for my client it&#39;ll download the cache then extract the cache into a sub-folder called &#39;NobleCache&#39; but I have set it to download the .zip file into Insanity-Pkz in the c: drive then extract itself into that folder.
I&#39;m completely confused to why its making a sub-folder inside of the Insanity-Pkz folder called NobleCache and storing the data in that file. I feel that I haven&#39;t done anything wrong and whenever I search Noble / NobleCache nothing comes up. 
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/68059584/Client.zip A link to my client(cache will auto download via the cachedownloader).
Thank you in advance.</description>
