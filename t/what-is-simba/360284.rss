    <title>What is Simba?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-simba/360284</link>
    <description>Simba is a free, open-source replacement for the venerable SCAR, it has reached a point where it is actually better than SCAR ever was and runs on multiple platforms (currently Linux and Windows, with Mac OSX soon to follow).

It is written and actively developed and maintained by a group of programmers over at SRL headed by Wizzup?, the following is what he wrote in the official release thread about Simba:


[ul][*] Simba is free to the bone; you don&#39;t have to pay anything for it and you can discover exactly how it works. It is open source.
[*] Cross platform. Simba runs on Linux and Windows, and Mac support is hopefully following.
[*] Actively developed; it is still under heavily development; so don&#39;t be amazed when you see regular updates that touch core features of Simba (the GUI).
[*] Open minded. We welcome all sorts of criticism and ideas.
[*] Documented. There is documentation on how to use Simba as well on how Simba actually [U]works[/U].
[*] Extensible; you can write your own extensions (or plug-ins, depending on how you want to call them) for Simba. You don&#39;t need anything but Simba to do this; and the extensions can vary from updaters, little user interface enhancements, to powerful tools like DTM editors.
[*] Simba is stable and quite fast
[*] Upcoming support for other programming languages.[/ul]


Simba features:


[ul][*] Run multiple scripts
[*] Code hints and completion
[*] Colour Picker History
[*] Auto updates
[*] Handful of useful tools to aid you while scripting.
[*] Full access to all settings[/ul]


So I would recommend everyone to switch from SCAR to Simba immediately, there are no downsides and only many benefits! :)

<p>Also, for those of you who are looking forward to python capabilities, (incoming shameless promotion) I’m working on a high-levelled OOP approach to pymml. I will fill in with more information as I go. The concepts use been formulating in my mind for months, and only yesterday made it from paper into some code.

<p>Shit… me neither.</p>
<p>Someone remind me why multilingual support is a good thing? I think it will make simba too vague, i.e scripts, tutorials, includes are specific for each language and cannot interact.</p>

The only thing the library and Simba share is that they both use the “MML”; (Mufasa Macro Library).</p>
<p>I’ll assume you’re talking about Simba and not libmml. Simba has plugin loading, and it loads native modules. That is .dll on Windows, .so on Linux. Because the plugins are loaded directly into the interpreter, they must export Pascal types. Or at least advertise them that way.</p>
<p>If I still don’t understand what you mean, perhaps you could try to explain it an a different way? Or provide some example I can grasp.</p>

<p>For those interested in other languages, we are basically writing a C library(libmml) that exports the Simba functionality for colours,bitmaps,dtms etc. Obviously other languages that can work with C libraries can use this library too: Python, C++, Java with JVM (and pretty much everyone language I suppose)</p>
<p>The Python implementation for this library uses ctypes. It isn’t finished as of yet, though. The same goes for the library. But we’re working on it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>I would assume the purpose of libmml is to implement the ability to write plugins in C.<br>
If so, how are you handling the potentially different natively-compiled module types? What about modules compiled to an intermediate language (a JAR, for instance)?</p>
<p>I really hope libmml isn’t just a complete port of the pascal library, because then users would have to write their own user interface (if needed) and implement their own design. The port should be left to do by whatever developer in need to rewrite most of the system in another language (since it is open source). The real priority for the core simba developers should be incorporating the ability to extend that which is already written (preferably through a dynamic system).<br>
[/quote]<br>
…[/quote]I see. I still think your priority should be implementing multilingual (programming languages, not speaking languages :)) support to your scripting system. Which, again, brings me to the question:</p>
<p>[quote=“abraham2119, post:12, topic:360284”]how <span class="bbcode-s">are</span> [will] you [be] handling the potentially different natively-compiled module types? What about modules compiled to an intermediate language (a JAR, for instance)?[/quote] And please don’t tell me you are going to write platform specific code to do something like load DLLs on Windows and SOs on Unix.</p>
<p>edit: (which is what, after taking a quick glance at the repository, I see you do with the dynamic dependencies).</p>

<p>Currently I would really call Win32 the only ``supported’’ operating system in the sense that it doesn’t have unknown (or known, not easily fixable) bugs. I don’t think the Extensions to Simba work on Linux because PascalScript is not working too well there just yet. (It does work in WINE…) A mac version is also in development.</p>

For those interested in other languages, we are basically writing a C library(libmml) that exports the Simba functionality for colours,bitmaps,dtms etc. Obviously other languages that can work with C libraries can use this library too: Python, C++, Java with JVM (and pretty much everyone language I suppose)</p>
<p>The Python implementation for this library uses ctypes. It isn’t finished as of yet, though. The same goes for the library.

I would assume the purpose of libmml is to implement the ability to write plugins in C.<br>
If so, how are you handling the potentially different natively-compiled module types? What about modules compiled to an intermediate language (a JAR, for instance)?</p>
<p>I really hope libmml isn’t just a complete port of the pascal library, because then users would have to write their own user interface (if needed) and implement their own design. The port should be left to do by whatever developer in need to rewrite most of the system in another language (since it is open source). The real priority for the core simba developers should be incorporating the ability to extend that which is already written (preferably through a dynamic system).[/quote]</p>
<p>Ah, I didn’t express myself that well, I’m afraid.<br>
libmml is NOT Simba functionality rewritten at all; it is simply a C-alike interface (wrapper) for Simba functions. We chose to use a C approach for obvious reasons; it is widely supported. libmml is written in FPC (Pascal); but it doesn’t use any of the Pascal types in the functions that it exports.</p>
<p>For example, findcolors() does not return a pascal array, but rather a pointer to point data. The reason is that FPC (and other Pascal implementations) all have managed arrays, which means we cannot be sure when they are freed, moved, etc. So what libmml does is call the pascal function and then perform a flatcopy of the array data onto data that we allocated ourselves (not using some super-managed system), and pass that to whatever program calls the library function. It is also the duty of the program to free this data. The performance hit caused by the copy is minimal.</p>
<p>Freeing and allocating memory that is shared among the program/libmml probably has to be done with the functions provided in libmml, but that shouldn’t cause a lot of issues.<br>
The types exported aren’t too complex and translated to the proper types on the fly, so it should be easy to use.</p>
<p>But yes, easy ``port’’ to another language will have to implement libmml (write an interface for it).</p>
<p>If you have a better solution, I’d like to hear them. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Well, you’ve been promising to port SCAR for ages, so lets be honest, to get it done you will have to release the source so someone else can do it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Hmm, that’s bs… And I’ve been working on a port for SCAR, but atm FPC isn’t good enough to make it work properly cross-platform, my code compiles, but for some reason it doesn’t work on linux… So I simply can’t continue until they make the cross-platform api implementation in FPC work properly… Also, porting a program as huge as SCAR isn’t something you just do, it’s a bitch to do once it’s written… This project I can keep easily portable from the start, that’s why my cross-platform version of SCAR is a rewrite…</p>
<p>And well, if I can’t port it, so be it, my software is closed source, you know I won’t debate that.[/quote]</p>
<p>Freddy should have taken a hint and got with the program, because now Simba exists and it’s pretty much SRL’s way of saying ‘Fuck off Freddy, we’re sick of your closed-source, windows-only software’.<br>
And I suppose the replacement of the SCAR sections with Simba sections is our way of saying</p>
