              <p>You want to be an admin on your server? Find your character save, and change “playerRights = 0” to 2.</p>
<p>If you are running a server like Hyperion/dementhium/matrix, you will have to add this on login, i.e.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">def login(player):	
	if player.getName().lower() == 'mod rs':
		player.setRights(Rights.ADMINISTRATOR)</code></pre>
<p>But yours will have to be Java syntax, most likely.</p>
