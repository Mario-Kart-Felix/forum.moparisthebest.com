    <description>Hello,

This evening I was at the grand exchange when some guy comes up to me asking if I could buy him 500 bronze minotaur pouches at 75k each and he would buy them off me because he hit limit. He gave me one to try and sell at mid ge price which was 1k something and I got 75k coins off the ge from the offer. I then accepted to help him and after they bought he just kind of ran off and now I am stuck with 800k worth of crap. THIS is what I get for trying to be a helpful person? Seriously, the rs community has gone downhill.

I don&#39;t know what to do. I don&#39;t want to just sell these for the market price and be out big money... but I cant sell them back from what i got them for.</description>

              <p>He was selling his own item. Fortunately for you, he is probably going to continue scamming people this way. What you can do is put those pouches back in the GE for 70k each. When he tries to scam others into buying his for 75k, they will automatically purchase from you first. This might take a few days, but I’ve made over 500m exploiting scammers’ methods.</p>
