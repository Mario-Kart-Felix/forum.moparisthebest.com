    <description>I&#39;m probably thinking there might be a topic about this already I just wanted to tell everyone a helpful hint on how to run Mopar on Windows Vista Premium all you gotta do is right click the MOPARSCAPE ENGINE then you click on RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR but if your windows vista is slow good luck with getting it to load it requires a fast computer to load on a Vista last I heard someone said MoparScape Engine wouldn&#39;t work on Vista I tried it on mine it worked really well. If I&#39;m annoying to you sorry about that mates &gt;.&gt; I might wanna say something off topic can I request a staff to delete my old I account I wasn&#39;t sure if they don&#39;t request name changes so I decided to make the name DanteiScape instead btw I&#39;m YuudaiScape I was wondering if a staff could delete that account as well if this topic isn&#39;t in the right place feel free to move it to the correct spot since it is talking about MoparScape Discussions I doubt it would be deleted any time soon but if yall didn&#39;t know Mopar works on vista now you do.  :D</description>
