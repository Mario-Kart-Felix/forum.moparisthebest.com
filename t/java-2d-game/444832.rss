    <title>[Java] 2D Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-2d-game/444832</link>
    <description>I put the text based game projects on the back burner for a while while I try my hand at making a 2D tile based game. There really isn&#39;t much in it right now since I&#39;m working on getting all the ground work done. It loads an image 512X512 of 32X32 tiles and makes sub images for each tile. The game engine reads in what tile to draw from a map file that contains the tile numbers. I then started working on an editor for maps. It lays tiles on a 32X32 grid(for the most part, there are still some bugs). You can change the selected tile by scrolling with the mouse wheel. It also has support for saving and loading, but there is a bug with loading that I haven&#39;t got around to fixing yet. My friend from school made the few tiles I have. In terms of content for the actual game I plan on it being sort of a dungeon crawler type game like Diablo. I haven&#39;t made a lot of progress, but I figured I&#39;d make this post anyway.

There&#39;s a lot of arbitrary numbers thrown in for the sizes of arrays an such because I don&#39;t know how else to handle the size of the arrays, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll figure something else out or someone here will point out m stupidity. Here is a link to my github for the project if you wanna check out the source: [url=https://github.com/realbinglebob/2D-Game]https://github.com/realbinglebob/2D-Game[/url]. Well that&#39;s it I guess, I hope you guys like the project!

              <p>I updated the first post with new pictures. The last one shows how the collision detection lets you walk up to the water, almost all the way (the tile isn’t exactly split in half with water and grass). I’ve implemented a top and bottom HUD for displaying health, mana, and progress to next level. There is a hotkey bar at the bottom for 8 items similar to minecraft.</p>
<p>I would also like to add that Ziplock decided that he wanted to help out with this game so this isn’t just my project anymore! Welcome to the team(again) buddy!</p>

              <p>Thanks! I would definitely say I’ve made a lot of progress so far. I finally uploaded a video to YouTube of me programming it,</p>

<p>I posted a lot of crap on my facebook even though none of my friends care haha so I’ll post the stuff I posted there, here.</p>
<p>Update <span class="hashtag">#2:</span><br>
So I’ve put a little more work into the game and you can finally walk around! The player is loaded from a sprite sheet and it cycles through each frame based of the direction last pressed. I just grabbed some random sprite sheet from the internet. I fixed up some bugs with the editor and the engine while also finding some new ones. I need to check the coordinates to see if a tile has been laid there and then change that tile number to the tile number that was just used. I also need to work out a way for collision so that you can’t walk on water, ect.</p>

<p>Update <span class="hashtag">#3:</span><br>
So this is another video of the 2D Game. I worked on some collision detection stuff, but as you can definitely see it’s not perfect. It doesn’t differentiate between tiles that are part grass and water and tiles that are just water. I’ll fix that later. Also the ground for predictive tile laying has been set. Read about that here if you wish: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/106884/Implementing-Auto-tiling-Functionality-in-a-Tile-M" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/106884/Implementing-Auto-tiling-Functionality-in-a-Tile-M</a><br>
I spent like 4+ hours on this last update because I had to rewrite the way that the tiles were stored so that they could hold the other 5 bits for auto tiling and collision detection. Then because I rewrote that, I had to rewrite how they were rendered because they weren’t just stored as an Image anymore, they were stored as a custom Tile object that I wrote. After that I had to fix issues with collision detection and it’s still not done. But ANYWAY…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/v/4161286914131" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.facebook.com/v/4161286914131</a></p>
<p>Update <span class="hashtag">#4:</span> (Current update)<br>
Round three mother fuckers. I finally fixed the collision detection so that the player can walk on tiles that aren’t entirely water or grass(shore tiles). The player can also now walk after colliding with a tile(but not in the direction of the tile that the player collided with). I literally found a shit ton of bugs while doing this, including a funny glitch that I dubbed the moon walk which I do at the end of the video.</p>
