    <title>Asus laptop OS is dead (I believe), stuck in a strange boot loop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/asus-laptop-os-is-dead-i-believe-stuck-in-a-strange-boot-loop/551177</link>
    <description>My friend got in contact with me over facebook the other day, saying she &quot;has 4 laptops that are broken, but need 2 to work&quot;. I said to bring em over and I&#39;d see what I can do.

Well. She brought two. And with their current conditions, I don&#39;t see how I&#39;m gonna get either to work. The Asus, I have more hope in than the Compaq.

Compaq issues:
Screen is dead. There is no way I can &quot;repair&quot; it. The only solution would be to get a new screen. I&#39;m not paying for that. Plus, the hard drive is probably also ruined, the keys are gross and some are broke, and the computer won&#39;t boot properly.
Reason? She got drunk and smashed it or something, thinking &quot;oh it&#39;ll fix it self in the morning&quot;....... I was told it was also used as a shot table, and shots can get messy.

Asus issues:
It won&#39;t start up. I&#39;ve tried booting it every which way now, and no avail. It&#39;s Running Windows 8 (Possibly 8.1, unsure). In the boot manager, there&#39;s literally no way to boot from the CD drive installed to the laptop. I&#39;ve tried running KillDisk via a USB, Linux USB&#39;s, Windows USB&#39;s, etc. All do the same thing. I hit enter to select the usb, it flashes and brings the prompt up. I hit enter again.. it acts like it&#39;ll run it, then the screen sits solid black.
When normally booting, it goes to the windows 8 logo.. gets stuck, and then reloads the computer in attempt to &quot;repair&quot; itself.. And then goes back to the black screen.

At this point.. I seriously don&#39;t understand what to do to fix the Asus pc. The compaq, I&#39;m really not worried about.

Also: I cannot run safe mode on the pc as the new UEFI BIOS doesn&#39;t allow it or whatever. I can get into the UEFI BIOS, and even try to boot from there, and it still does not work. I&#39;ve tried all the tutorials I could find on google. They all say to make a disk or a usb, or to use automatic repair (By hitting F8). Not one of these options work.

Anyone got a solution?</description>

<p>Once you get the part number you google search and find the best price on amazon/ebay m8.</p>
<p>Anyway, with the other problems you mentioned that laptop sounds like its fucked beyond repair to be honest. You probably should recommend that she look into purchasing a new one rather then spending all the money to repair it.</p>

I actually already found her a new monitor for the Compaq. I brought it up to her it still works, but her screen is beyond repair. I’ve never seen a screen get ‘fixed’ after in this bad of shape. Amazon sells the screen for like $50, idk if partsurfer is going to be any cheaper. I think she’s gonna try and save money and just use a desktop monitor (Her bf contacted me asking if I had an extra.), though.<br>
Actually, I just went on partsurfer and can’t seem to actually get a price… It just kinda says information about the product. Literally 0 pricing. XG809UA is the product number and the screen is listed. I just don’t see prices.</p>
<p>As for the asus… Welp. I honestly don’t even know where the fudge the RAM is on this thing. I’ve never seen a laptop put together like this. Then again, I haven’t fiddled with that many laptops.<br>
<img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NA5Mgtqi8oU/maxresdefault.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
The empty spot near the hand is where the hard drive goes. and the empty slot near the word “Asus” is where the battery goes.<br>
I’m going to assume the RAM is tucked underneath the MOBO. Which means more dis-assembly.</p>
<p>Edit: Found the ram, it was on the bottom of the MOBO. It was a single 4GB ram stick. Actually surprised me a bit.<br>
Also, what kind of company doesn’t add a second RAM slot? There was only one. That’s so weak.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Asus harddrive still not working. I’m going to blame that on whatever caused the long test to fail as stated earlier. However, running the Compaq harddrive gave me a bluescreen (First time).<br>
Basically. It’s bitching about the BIOS. But I take this as some progress.</p>
<p>Here’s the exact error: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/831691" rel="nofollow noopener">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/831691</a> but it’s on computer start, not load from hibernation.</p>

It won’t let me boot from either USB or disc. When I put a disc in the tray, it doesn’t even recognize the tray exists. There are no boot options to load from the disc either. And when I try to load through USB, all the screen does is flicker (as if trying to load it) and then goes right back to the boot manager.</p>
<p>As for the recovery option. no go. I’ve even tried putting other, working hard drives into this thing and it still didn’t want to boot.</p>

<p>Yeah actually. I ran a long generic on the Compaq hard drive, it passed. So I plugged it into the asus, and it wouldn’t even give the option to boot to the hard drive.</p>
<p>I’ve only got 1 other hard drive to use, but it has no OS on it. I could install linux to it and see if that’d run on the asus.</p>
<p>Edit: Stupid idea, but I’m try plugging the asus hard drive into the compaq, and then plugging that into my monitor. I’ll see if I can’t get that drive to boot… See if it’s a hard drive failure that way…</p>
<p>Edit 2: So it booted, kinda. It went to a black screen and said the smart disk found an error that will cause imminent failure…<br>
<span class="bbcode-s">Running a self test right now (It said to).</span> Test failed. Got a 301 and a 303 error. no idea what they mean.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Strange enough, the compaq still works. But I can’t seem to get it’s hard drive to boot on the asus…</p>

<p>I’m getting some undetermined amount of money. It’s not going to be a huge amount, so that’d be why I’m not putting effort into the Compaq.</p>
<p>Also, I’m pretty certain the Compaq’s drive is fudgeed. I plugged it into my computer monitor and it wouldn’t even load on the screen. And the little bit I could see on the compaq’s screen looked like either A) A black screen saying it could not load the hard drive or B) A black screen saying it couldn’t load windows.</p>
<p>As for the Asus:<br>
Yes, there’s a default boot. I can change it as well. The default is some windows bootloader. I assume it’s the loader for windows 8. There are no other options. I can add my own option (Which I have no idea how/what it’s really asking…), OR, if I boot the PC up with a USB plugged in, I can select the USB. It doesn’t load the USB though… I’ve tried inserting a CD and picking the option to run the CD drive, but it doesn’t display one.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, please be aware the Asus’s BIOS is a new BIOS. and not the default BIOS that came with Windows 7 and earlier models. It’s the UEFI BIOS, and it doesn’t seem to be much help</p>

<p>Just clean it the best you can, you should be able to work around it with a either VGA/HDMI monitor. I’ve had to clean laptops with spills on them before, it sucks and it isn’t an easy job but it is do-able, and just tell that chick to buy another screen for it, just find the part and send it to her on facebook and say order it. It shouldn’t be very expensive.</p>
<p>Asus:<br>
Every BIOS should have a default boot, or there should be an option to select the boot drive. I’ve only had a problem like this on a computer that was manufactured in 2000, I had to update the bios which is easy. Doing so allowed me do what needed to be done, on the asus laptop it should have the option to boot to either disc or USB. From what I read she may have corrupted the OS due to viruses, I’ve seen that countless times. Just re-install the OS and grab the drivers and be done with it.</p>

              <p>My friend got in contact with me over facebook the other day, saying she “has 4 laptops that are broken, but need 2 to work”. I said to bring em over and I’d see what I can do.</p>
<p>Well. She brought two. And with their current conditions, I don’t see how I’m gonna get either to work. The Asus, I have more hope in than the Compaq.</p>
<p>Compaq issues:<br>
Screen is dead. There is no way I can “repair” it. The only solution would be to get a new screen. I’m not paying for that. Plus, the hard drive is probably also ruined, the keys are gross and some are broke, and the computer won’t boot properly.<br>
Reason? She got drunk and smashed it or something, thinking “oh it’ll fix it self in the morning”… I was told it was also used as a shot table, and shots can get messy.</p>
<p>Asus issues:<br>
It won’t start up. I’ve tried booting it every which way now, and no avail. It’s Running Windows 8 (Possibly 8.1, unsure). In the boot manager, there’s literally no way to boot from the CD drive installed to the laptop. I’ve tried running KillDisk via a USB, Linux USB’s, Windows USB’s, etc. All do the same thing. I hit enter to select the usb, it flashes and brings the prompt up. I hit enter again… it acts like it’ll run it, then the screen sits solid black.<br>
When normally booting, it goes to the windows 8 logo… gets stuck, and then reloads the computer in attempt to “repair” itself… And then goes back to the black screen.</p>
<p>At this point… I seriously don’t understand what to do to fix the Asus pc. The compaq, I’m really not worried about.</p>
<p>Also: I cannot run safe mode on the pc as the new UEFI BIOS doesn’t allow it or whatever. I can get into the UEFI BIOS, and even try to boot from there, and it still does not work. I’ve tried all the tutorials I could find on google. They all say to make a disk or a usb, or to use automatic repair (By hitting F8). Not one of these options work.</p>
<p>Anyone got a solution?</p>
