    <title>Design Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/design-question/393163</link>
    <description>Just have a question about good Java design. I have a Location class, and I&#39;m not sure whether I should handle it as an immutable object or not. Currently I have getters and setters for the 3 fields, x, y, and z.

I have two methods for an Entity, setLocation, defined as:

[code=Java]
public final void setLocation(Location location) {
    location_ = location;
}

public final void setLocation(int x, int y, int z) {
    location_.setX(x);
    location_.setY(y);
    locatoin_.setZ(z);
}
[/code]

I&#39;m not sure if I should keep the second method as it is, or remove the setters from Location, and have the second method defined as
[code=Java]
public final void setLocation(int x, int y, int z) {
    location_ = new Location(x, y, z);
}[/code]

But then that kind of makes the second method unnecessary.

What are your thoughts?</description>

Im not even going to pretend to understand all of what you just said or what you intend to use it for, but I do believe java has a built in location class, couldnt you just use that?</p>
<p>Honestly though, its probably beyond almost everyone who views the help board <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>

<p>Even if they did, the question still remains. Whether I should handle the Location class as an immutable object.[/quote]<br>
Probably best to make it immutable as there is no need for changing anything once its set, would make it run faster too if im not mistaken. And i do believe the first set up would work better if you are making it immutable. Honestly though, i doubt it would make much of a difference in the time it takes to execute.</p>
<p>Bear in mind my limited knowledge on the subject, just figured since its in the help section, i would give it a try <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
