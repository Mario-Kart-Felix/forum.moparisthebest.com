I&#39;m looking for another Developer for a dedicated server we can run.

Content Developer: - Must know Java/basic scripting. 
Javaguru(On R-S) The Djinn (Mopar)
Open
Open

Website Developer: - Must know HTML, PHP, MYSQL. 
Javaguru
The web guy

Core Developer: - Must know Java.
Javaguru
Open

Skills/Misc Developer: - Must know Java.
Javaguru
Open


[code]
1. MSN:
2. Years of java experience:
3. Your previous projects:
4. How long will you be able to work on Battle-X each day:
5. What would you like to focus on (Skills, Quests, Core,  Website, Content, etc):
[/code]

Why should you join?
This server is destined to succeed. 
I have no problem with any expenses on Dedicated Server hosting as I have 4 dedicated servers for various things I do. (Can show, 3 Windows, 1 CentOS)
The only reason I shut my RS2 Servers down in the past was because I was by myself and didn&#39;t have all the time to work on it, but they all hit high players.
I&#39;m good with various languages that would be needed, ie: Java, php, html, mysql, js, ect.
You will also get a cookie.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Added Character/Forum registration accounts are linked to eachother, added a option to hide yourself on hiscores. Added a deletion pin which is required to change your ingame accounts password. It is also required to have if you want to delete your ingame account. Encrypts in MD5. Will be required to be registered on the website inorder to play/login. Everything will be saved to MySQL - banks,inventorys,stats,experience, ect. Each account is limited to 10 ingame accounts, if they want another they will need to delete an ingame account. It&#39;s going to be 1 starter set per forum account. 1 Forum account per IP. (Still need to implement this) -won&#39;t be hard to do though.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Website will be [url=Http://Battle-X.net]Http://Battle-X.net[/url] (IPB at the moment, will redo everything soon when I got some time, might make a home page.)

I&#39;ll be using this base, it&#39;s Project Insanity. I hosted it about 5 months ago, I already worked on some of it as of today as well.

Some of my past projects which I mainly discontinued/don&#39;t work on.

Ready, go.

PS. I won&#39;t accept immature people, nor people who know little to nothing. I&#39;ll be testing you on a few things as well to make sure you know what you&#39;re doing. I&#39;m mainly looking for another developer because I have Work, College, and other things so I&#39;m busy and can&#39;t and don&#39;t have all the time in the world to work on it 24-7 by myself.

-----
I just had 2 other developers that I just kicked out due to the reason they weren&#39;t on and did no work what-so-ever and probably just wanted to get the source/updates I did on them. I want people who are dedicated and can work on it daily.</description>

Sure you showed your past projects, but you haven’t told us anything about this one. How do we know what you’re looking for, server-wise? We don’t. As of now, I think you’re wanting a partner so they can do all the work. This goes back to what I said previously. We must have proof that this will actually go somewhere, and that it’s a serious project.[/quote]’</p>
<p>I’ve showed you past projects, and a project that has been running nearly 3 1/2 years now? I’ve showed your enough proof of my work, due to the past projects I’ve posted. If you would really like to see some more of my work feel free to add me on msn or skype. I’ll post some pictures of development. I had another project thread on here back from a few months ago, (6 months ago ) but I decided not to bump it and start from a scratch one. I’ll pull some things off that.</p>

              <p>How do you expect to gain developers if you don’t have any proof of <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> work. Sure you showed your past projects, but you haven’t told us anything about this one. How do we know what you’re looking for, server-wise? We don’t. As of now, I think you’re wanting a partner so they can do all the work. This goes back to what I said previously. We must have proof that this will actually go somewhere, and that it’s a serious project.</p>

<p>I’m looking for another Developer for a dedicated server we can run.</p>

3. Your previous projects:
4. How long will you be able to work on Battle-X each day:
5. What would you like to focus on (Skills, Quests, Core,  Website, Content, etc):</code></pre>
<p>Why should you join?<br>
This server is destined to succeed.<br>
I have no problem with any expenses on Dedicated Server hosting as I have 4 dedicated servers for various things I do. (Can show, 3 Windows, 1 CentOS)<br>
The only reason I shut my RS2 Servers down in the past was because I was by myself and didn’t have all the time to work on it, but they all hit high players.<br>
I’m good with various languages that would be needed, ie: Java, php, html, mysql, js, ect.<br>
You will also get a cookie.</p>
<blockquote>Added Character/Forum registration accounts are linked to eachother, added a option to hide yourself on hiscores. Added a deletion pin which is required to change your ingame accounts password. It is also required to have if you want to delete your ingame account. Encrypts in MD5. Will be required to be registered on the website inorder to play/login. Everything will be saved to MySQL - banks,inventorys,stats,experience, ect. Each account is limited to 10 ingame accounts, if they want another they will need to delete an ingame account. It's going to be 1 starter set per forum account. 1 Forum account per IP. (Still need to implement this) -won't be hard to do though.</blockquote>

<p>The Website will be <a href="Http://Battle-X.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Http://Battle-X.net</a> (IPB at the moment, will redo everything soon when I got some time, might make a home page.)</p>
<p>I’ll be using this base, it’s Project Insanity. I hosted it about 5 months ago, I already worked on some of it as of today as well.</p>

<p>Some of my past projects which I mainly discontinued/don’t work on.</p>

<p>Ready, go.</p>
<p>PS. I won’t accept immature people, nor people who know little to nothing. I’ll be testing you on a few things as well to make sure you know what you’re doing. I’m mainly looking for another developer because I have Work, College, and other things so I’m busy and can’t and don’t have all the time in the world to work on it 24-7 by myself.</p>
<hr>
<p>I just had 2 other developers that I just kicked out due to the reason they weren’t on and did no work what-so-ever and probably just wanted to get the source/updates I did on them. I want people who are dedicated and can work on it daily.</p>
