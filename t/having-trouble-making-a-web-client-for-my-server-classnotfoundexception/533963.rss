    <title>Having trouble making a web client for my server. ClassNotFoundException</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/having-trouble-making-a-web-client-for-my-server-classnotfoundexception/533963</link>
    <description>Can someone please assist me or teamview me to help me get my web client going. I have signed and jar&#39;d my client properly and have everything in the C:/ drive like the cache and everything. I pasted this code on my website 
[code]&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;black&quot;&gt;
&lt;title&gt;LostRealm718 Webclient&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;applet name=client width=100% height=100% archive &#39;https://www.dropbox.com/s/sbla3iyw5kb532p/Client.jar&#39; code=&#39;Loader.class&#39;&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;[/code]
and it seems to not be able to understand the Loader.class part or it can&#39;t find it.

I tried putting the actual loader.class file into my C:/ drive but it didn&#39;t seem to help any.

oh and sorry I just noticed this was the server section, can someone move it to the client section.</description>
