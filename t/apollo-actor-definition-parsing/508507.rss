<p>I do not understand what you’re getting at in all honesty…Please think thoroughly before posting.<br>
I think you’re arguing about the naming; I did not mention the naming on my post, but now that you mention it, it’s a bad name.</p>

<p>Both entity and game characters are correct, but entity would be the superclass in this case.</p>
<p>Like I said before, there is no “player definitions”.</p>
<p>If you’re saying it’s justified, but you’re not justifying it, how is it justified?</p>
