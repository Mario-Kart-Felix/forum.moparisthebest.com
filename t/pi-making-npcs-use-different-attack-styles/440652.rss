    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-making-npcs-use-different-attack-styles/440652</link>
    <description>For some of you this will be easy. And a lot of you most likely already know how to do this. 

First off, find an NPC you want to work with. I&#39;ll use kbd since in majority/all servers the NPC id is 50

Open your NPCHandler.java and find
[code]public void loadSpell(int i) [/code]
and under the switch statement
You&#39;ll need to make a new case for your NPC, like so.
[code]case 50:[/code]
Now, before we go any further you will want to know the attack types. Melle = 0,Range = 1,Magic = 2
Now to make the GFX of the attack appear...
[code]npcs[i].endGfx = INT;
	  npcs[i].projectileId = INT;[/code]
What these do, is tell what GFX to play on the player, and what GFX to play when the attack is in motion basically.
So let&#39;s make the KBD attack with a ball of fire.
It would look like this.
[code]
case 50:
           npcs[i].attackType = 2;
           npcs[i].endGfx = 157;
           npcs[i].projectileId = 440;
break;[/code]
This will make the NPC chosen use magic, have the GFX in motion use 440, and your character play the GFX 157.
Now if you want to make an NPC use multiple attack styles, you&#39;ll need this.
[code]int RandomAnything = Misc.random(INT);[/code]
What this does, is begin playing random numbers of up to any number you&#39;ve chosen.
So to make your NPC use different attack styles, you would do the following.
[code]
case 50:
       int random = Misc.random(1);
     if (random == 0) { //magic
      npcs[i].attackType = 2;
      npcs[i].endGfx = 157;
      npcs[i].projectileId = 440;
} else if (random == 1) { //range
     npcs[i].attackType = 1;
     npcs[i].endGfx = -1;
     npcs[i].projectileId = 1627; //(I picked this out of random so idk what it is)
}
break;[/code]
What this says is, if random is equal to 0 than it will use the magic attack and play the corresponding GFX(s).
If random is equal to 1 it will use the range attack and play the corresponding GFX(s).
If your NPC has a different animation for using a different attack, still in NPCHandler find this:
[code]public static int getAttackEmote(int i)[/code]
And under the switch statement,
You would do it like this.
[code]case 50:
		if (npcs[i].attackType == 2) //magic
		return INT;
		else if (npcs[i].attackType == 1)//range
		return INT;[/code]
What this says, is if the attackType is equal to 2 then it will use that animation. If the attack Type is equal to 1 than it will use the other animation.


I explained this as best as I could, feed back would be nice.

-This is my first tutorial, I hope I helped people out.</description>
