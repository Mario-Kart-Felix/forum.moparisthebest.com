    <title>Mobile theme</title>

    <description>The mobile theme needs a bit of a revamp. A lot of my posting is done from a smartphone, and it&#39;s much easier to scroll and read using the mobile theme, not to mention the loading.

To begin, a report topic would be nice. I find that at some hours, spam topics or things in wrong sections won&#39;t get noticed for a bit unless reported, so I find I have to leave the mobile theme, report the topic, then change back.

To go along with that, from what I know staff cannot delete/move/lock topics from mobile devices, so that should be implemented as well

A &#39;see who replied to your topic/post&#39; button would greatly come in handy, as now I can actually track topics that I&#39;ve been involved in without having to locate them.

If there was any way that youtube videos could be hidden during the mobile theme unless clicked, that would be great. I find on some pages (what are you listening to, funny pics/vids) that the page will take an obnoxious amount of time to load. It would be much easier if this was not shown unless requested in some way.

Finally, when replying to someone, if the text thing (where you start typing) would begin at the bottom of the quote rather then the top, it would be much easier to reply. On my android device I can simply scroll down, however on my iTouch I am unable to scroll through the text box, meaning that when replying with a long paragraph, any type of misclick could ruin my progress and I can&#39;t reply to any individual posts (quoting).

Thanks, hope to see these get added.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Taharok, post:2, topic:444348”]I spent some time after reading this topic looking around on simple machine’s website for some solutions to what you suggested. I cannot find anything. Some features would allow us to slightly fix a few things you mentioned, but nothing exists that solves it all. I would recommend you look around yourself on simple machines, smf hacks, or wherever else for a solution like this. We can’t develop an entirely new system just for a single suggestion. If you wanted to do it, that’s fine. Otherwise, it can’t go through.</p>

Oh alright then. Thanks for trying.</p>
