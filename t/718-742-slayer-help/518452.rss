    <description>hey everyone so i finaly released my server and i noticed something i was warned about rune-evo but i just never listened. not to long ago i remember someone telling me slayer was bugged in the source. I never realy payed close attention to it because i had far more important things to do, now i that i have released it, i gotta stay on the ball and keep a look out for things not working. Anyway my problem with slayer is that kuradle assigns the player a task, As soon as the player goes to do their task they are not getting xp for killing the monsters (at first i thought it was because all of the monsters you were assigned the player had to kill every monster then get xp) however thats not the case, for some reason when the player does their task they dont even get a notification if they have completed or even xp, they go and talk to kuradle again and she says to kill the same ammount (even if the player has spent half an hour killing the assigned npc) and the player dosnt get any xp at all, so i guess you could say my slayer is pretty much pointless :) any1 know a fix? thanks</description>
