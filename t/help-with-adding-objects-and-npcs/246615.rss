    <description>Ok well first off i want to say that im new to 508 servers and im gonna need some help  :rolleyes:  so, umm first off i need to know how to add globalobjects and how to make those globals objects tele you somewhere. Also, need to know how to add NPC&#39;s non-attackable and attackable. And i also need to know how to make a command that can only be used once Ex: ::starter

And if anyone knows how to make it so that i can have the player start off with an outfit that would be cool too. Thanks and help greatly appreciated :)&gt;</description>
