    <title>LAST QUESTION and it will be up MAYBE :D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/last-question-and-it-will-be-up-maybe-d/374723</link>
    <description>ok i decided to use hamachi since portforwarding isnt really working for me. It works but just for some freaking reason, it says &quot;error connecting to server&quot;. I think i&#39;m missing something so for someone who has hamachi, can you tell me what? Or even better is a link to a really good tutorial :).

Also i found a reason why my serv might not be working. Every time i click on run.bat, it shows Ownagescape Server... 
then it keeps showing &quot;null&quot;, as shown below.
