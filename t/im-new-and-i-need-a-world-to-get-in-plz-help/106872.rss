              <p>OK well there are many different worlds and every day there is normally a new world that comes up and all u have to do is have these forums open and moparscape on the bar below. Then you go to “server advertisment” and u look on there and people advertise there as u say “worlds” then u see if they are online when it had the box filled in with green and if it is filled with green then u try it out and sometimes it still wont work if the box is green because they could be working on somthing that is not going on there server properly. And when people are working on there servers noone can get into them. And some servers work 24/7 this is because the people either leave there computer on or they have a program that keeps the server up. Otherwise if you don’t do that then when u turn off your computer then it will stop working and noone can get in it they may only get in it when there on the computer and have turned the server online. If you have any other questions just PM me by clicking on my name " Mikeey " and at the bottom it will say message and just send me your message hope i helped you out.
