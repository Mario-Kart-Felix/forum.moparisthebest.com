    <title>New section for the vehicle fanatics</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-section-for-the-vehicle-fanatics/444839</link>
    <description>There should be a section to talk about any type of vehicle (from cars to dirt bikes).  I&#39;m sure there are some people here that know a lot about cars and have their own projects (including me) and would like to share their project with other people to get opinions.  Or to at least show off your vehicle.

A section where we could also talk about different type of engines. Pros and cons of each differential engines, like the difference between 4 cylinder and 6 cylinder.   To talk about brakes (disc and drum), tires, rims, wheels, gauges, etc.  And also some guides could be posted on how to fix certain parts of any vehicles (of course manufacturer specific), and prob have different child boards for each manufacturer (GM, ford, etc.).  Or guides on how to maintain a clean parts of the vehicle, or tutorials on what to look for in a car when buying and what to watch out when selling.. tons of stuff could be in this section.

I would personally love it because I want opinions from my 1980 el camino project from other people.</description>

<p>Of course, that’s just my opinion. You should wait to see what other staff members have to say.[/quote]<br>
Oh, I understand completely.  I did not know MITB had a vehicles section; seems like there’s more worlds that mitb keeps creating and hiding.</p>
<p>It was merely an idea that I thought somebody would like.</p>
