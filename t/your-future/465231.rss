    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/your-future/465231</link>
    <description>I was just curious as to what you all, the members of the MoparScape community, plan on doing in the future. What is your &#39;dream job?&#39; Right out of high-school I want to move down to [i]Eddyville[/i], [i]KY[/i] and become a correctional officer working for the state penitentiary.

Why? Well, for about 2-3 years now I have had my mind set. I was debating whether or not to become a police officer or a CO, I went with CO. I&#39;ve always had a fascination with prisons/inmates. No, I have no clue why.

So, what do you all plan on doing?</description>

Most people are undecided, but that’s not bad; it’s better to pick something you love, taking time and researching, instead of picking some bogus major just for the money and doing something you hate for the rest of your life.</p>

              <p>I want to do something with computer science, but there is always a part I come across that makes me lose inspiration and faith in my future. There are many times where I just stop caring and give up all hope for my future, which is why I went from an honor role student to getting high B averages on assignments. I’m taking my third year in an engineering class (includes several branchs; electrical, mechanical, and industrial), but the knowledge we learn is sometimes limited and simple. I’m trying to bring my grades up and get involved in more extracurricular activities, because those play a huge factor in being accepted to a certain college.</p>

<p>OT: I’ve recently been debating between computer science and game programming, and then engineering. I actually enjoy game programming. Been taking a swing at it lately and its fun, but I have training in engineering and robotics as well. I have a strong chance at getting a job at a software company within the next couple of weeks so we will see how that goes.</p>

I plan on earning my masters in mechanical engineering by starting out in Palm Beach State College to earn my associates degree, then transfer to a University in Florida which offers a great engineering program.  I want to work on robotics for a living, creating the next big thing in technology; a full-functional autonomous robot that will soon be in everybody’s home.<br>
[/quote]<br>
not in my home[/quote]Actually, there already is an somewhat autonomous robot in everybody’s home.  Not one that can mimic human behavior, but one that can do simple tasks like using the internet, making calls, GPS, etc.; a smartphone if you don’t catch my drift.</p>

<p>Sadly I retired from flipping gp. Now I pay asians to work my site for me, go to the bank every few days in my BMW from my beach condo, stop at a five star for some lunch than come back. My partner has a degree in business and I’m going to get a minor in business so don’t pull this no degree crap either.</p>
