<p>Speaking from a Christian viewpoint, we all are sinners because of the consequences of the actions of two people (I think you know who they are). The result of that consequence led to the  imperfection of the entire human race. God understands that nobody is perfect. To not allow the souls of potential sinners to exist is basically saying no to the entire human race. And to your question concerning homosexuality: people aren’t born naturally into a specific sexual orientation. A person’s sexual orientation is based on (in my opinion) two factors, which one of them is choice, and the other external influences (the media, family, the community, etc). Keep in mind, God completely  allows freedom of choice; the question is whether he supports all of these actions or not.[/quote]<br>
Ok, prove that homosexuality is caused by an external factor. Make someone gay.<br>
Ex-gay ministries admit themselves that they cannot cure homosexuality, just keep the urges under control. Your view have no root in reality.</p>
<p>PS: Yes, we all know that the first humans was Ask and Embla. And you should join a DPRK friendship group, because they need your support. The west are attacking them for lack of democracy and doing what pleases the dear leader. That and punishing people for insulting the great leader. The stuff you and your God like.</p>

<p>Alright then. If it’s not caused by genetic or external factors, what is its origin? Care to explain? Also, I have no idea why you digressed from this topic to matters related to the DPRK. If there’s a country without religion…</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t understand; how can a country look like God? The human race exemplifies everything imperfect in the world. I assume you are referring to the totalitarian dictatorship of North Korea when you mentioned it. If that was what you originally meant, I don’t see how that relates to God or religion at all. Perhaps that might reflect Christian government (such as Puritanism, yuck!), but definitely not God. And also, please elaborate on how am I defending North Korea. Quoting myself, “God completely allows freedom of choice; the question is whether he supports all of these actions or not”, I don’t see how that justifies God’s actions at all. Viewing this from your standpoint, I would even ask, “What actions?”.</p>

        <p>Bowser jr, God doesn’t like sending people to hell. He’s a loving figure and wishes for all of you to go to heaven; after all, you are his children. Due to the imperfectness of humans (specifically sin), we deserve to be damned for our actions. Free choice doesn’t mean ‘free’ as in ‘you can do anything you want and get away with it’, it means that you have a choice to do what you want with your life. Also, there’s a reason why Jesus died on the cross: to give you the option of spending eternal life with him.</p>
<p>You know what, let’s not continue with us. Clearly none of us is going to be persuaded.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

So sex then :P, you are legal? (Will you dress up like a cat?)</p>
<p>Here you are using the same defence for God that you could use for a dictator, God is the lawmaker so shut up and follow his rules. The fact is that he thinks I deserve hell, but does nothing about it. Forget DPRK, he is like Obama.</p>

Listen to facts is a choice, except if you want to argue something. None of us promote the gay gene idea, because that is not the most likely explanation. The hormonal imbalance while your are still in the womb is the cause. If you don’t watch out, Niall will post a long answer where he is spoon-feeding the facts into you.</p>
<p>And think about it, why would a gene that makes you less willing to reproduce be able to survive? It is a poor straw man.</p>

        <p>I do believe whether you are gay or not can be influenced heavily by the environment you live in, as that is what makes you who you are. Twins are born at the same time, look the same, and are even brought up by the same parents, but are usually two total different people. This is because they have different life experiences that shape the kind of person they are. They may also just have different likes and dislikes by nature.</p>
<p>Someone posted earlier saying that there was no proof or anything behind reasoning such as this, but I suggest you do some research. There has been a lot of research done into serial killers and their upbringings and a lot of their parents have been found to be drug users/child abusers. This causes the child to hate people/life. I also know of a kid that where his father didn’t really play any role in his bringing up. However, his mom always took him shopping and to his great aunts to go knitting and such. Does this mean that because of this he is now gay? No, but i’m willing to bet that it did have some influence on him.</p>
<p>Tl;dr I do think that hormonal imbalances are probably the major factor, but environmental factors most likely play a role too.</p>
<p>Note: Been a while since I have read on the subject of upbringings of serial killers, so some of those facts may be slightly wrong. I usually have a pretty good memory.</p>
