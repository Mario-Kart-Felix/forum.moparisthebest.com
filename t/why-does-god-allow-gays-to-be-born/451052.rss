    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-does-god-allow-gays-to-be-born/451052</link>
    <description>Supposedly god does not take a liking to gays, according to some extremist religious groups. 

Now, according to you, we all have souls right? So why does God allow people who Sin to be born in the first place? Why does he allow the souls of potential sinners exist?</description>

              <p>I don’t really see it as “some people are gay” I see it as more of a psychological issue honestly.</p>
<p>When a little boy dresses up as a girl does that make them gay? Or are they doing something that is fun with them? When a boy grows their hair out like a female does, does that make them gay?</p>
<p>A fairly recent study had been done which they did a documentary on dateline about talked about this little boy who wanted to be a girl. The doctors discussed how most people in the scenario no matter of the original gender by a certain age will either return to the original gender or still continue to desire being the other gender.</p>
<p>When asked several of these children responded they wanted to make one or more figures in their life happy.</p>

              <p>I do believe whether you are gay or not can be influenced heavily by the environment you live in, as that is what makes you who you are. Twins are born at the same time, look the same, and are even brought up by the same parents, but are usually two total different people. This is because they have different life experiences that shape the kind of person they are. They may also just have different likes and dislikes by nature.</p>
<p>Someone posted earlier saying that there was no proof or anything behind reasoning such as this, but I suggest you do some research. There has been a lot of research done into serial killers and their upbringings and a lot of their parents have been found to be drug users/child abusers. This causes the child to hate people/life. I also know of a kid that where his father didn’t really play any role in his bringing up. However, his mom always took him shopping and to his great aunts to go knitting and such. Does this mean that because of this he is now gay? No, but i’m willing to bet that it did have some influence on him.</p>
<p>Tl;dr I do think that hormonal imbalances are probably the major factor, but environmental factors most likely play a role too.</p>
<p>Note: Been a while since I have read on the subject of upbringings of serial killers, so some of those facts may be slightly wrong. I usually have a pretty good memory.</p>

Homosexuality is a choice, and the reason why I’m saying that is because there is absolutely no proof of the Gay gene or anything that would cause someone to be attracted to another individual of the same gender. Not one Scientist will claim that their is a gay gene, because that’s their reputation a stake.[/quote]<br>
Listen to facts is a choice, except if you want to argue something. None of us promote the gay gene idea, because that is not the most likely explanation. The hormonal imbalance while your are still in the womb is the cause. If you don’t watch out, Niall will post a long answer where he is spoon-feeding the facts into you.</p>
<p>And think about it, why would a gene that makes you less willing to reproduce be able to survive? It is a poor straw man.</p>

The incredible events of September 11, 2001 thrust into the world’s collective consciousness the age-old question: “If there is a God, and if He is a loving God, how could He have allowed such a horrifically evil occurrence?” Corollary to that question are many other equally heart-bending inquiries such as: “Is what happened on September 11 somehow a part of a sovereign God’s plan for mankind?” Or: “Do you mean to tell me that God knew exactly what was going to happen and did nothing to stop it?”</p>
<p>The problem of evil, that is, how evil can co-exist with a God who says He is love, is not only one that often tragically affects us personally, but it is also one that has turned countless people away from the Creator, who longs for them to know Him for who He truly is. Given the Christian Church’s traditional answers to the above questions, I think it is safe to assume that even millions of Christians are plagued with doubt as to whether some God-ordained tragedy may befall them. If knowing the truth makes one free, then believing something contrary to God’s Word, especially about such a vital issue as this, could put people in great bondage.<br>
