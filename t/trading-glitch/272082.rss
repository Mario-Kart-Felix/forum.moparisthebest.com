    <title>Trading glitch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trading-glitch/272082</link>
    <description>Alright, im using the Dragon-History server, I&#39;ve been working on it for a while, and I noticed a small glitch when logging out.
After fixing that glitch, I noticed a more sever bug had appeared.

The bug is this, when you trade with someone successfully, not only do you get the items they placed up for trade, but you also get yours back too!

I know I haven&#39;t touched any of the trading related things, and replacing the client.java is out of the question. 

Anyone have any help?

Much obliged.</description>
