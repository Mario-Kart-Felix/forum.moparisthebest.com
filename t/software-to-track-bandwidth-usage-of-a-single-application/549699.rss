    <title>Software to track bandwidth usage of a single application</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/software-to-track-bandwidth-usage-of-a-single-application/549699</link>
    <description>I currently use 3 droplets with digital ocean for cryptocurrency wallets. I want to monitor how much bandwidth each wallet uses per day. Digital ocean has a limit of 2tb per month with my plan and I want to see if I can utilize some of the unused resources without going over my limit. Digital ocean does provide charts for viewing my mbps usage but nothing that totals it up. I use Ubuntu 14 on the vps

After googling around a bit it looks like http://humdi.net/vnstat/ will do what I need does anyone have experience with this application or know a better alternative?</description>
