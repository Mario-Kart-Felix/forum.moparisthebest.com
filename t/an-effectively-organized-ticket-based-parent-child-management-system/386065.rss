    <title>An effectively organized ticket-based parent-child management system</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-effectively-organized-ticket-based-parent-child-management-system/386065</link>
    <description>The other day, a friend of mine, who runs a company that deals with a lot of clients, presented a fascinating idea to me about some sort of management system. He, lets call him Bob, creates and maintains hundreds of websites and effectively needs to keep his time organized so that he deals with his clients in an orderly fashion. On a typical work day, he goes in and gets calls from multiple clients requesting changes to each individual website, but before he can do so, he needs to finish working on the websites from the previous day/week. Instead of working with the client that calls right away, he makes a note and gives an estimate on when he will complete the requested changes.

He presented me with an idea of managing his clients in an orderly fashion, like a ticket-based system (BugZilla, Mantis, Unfuddle), but the uniqueness I&#39;m seeing in this idea is that it would display everything in a calendar-like view. Think of it as [url=http://calendar.google.com/]Google Calendar[/url] with, instead of planned events at specific times, tickets lined up, one-by-one on top of each other, ordered by a priority level (Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest) and containing notes, descriptions, file attachments, etc. There would also be breaks in the task organization (breaks, lunch) to allow for free time as well as some added time to each task so that he wouldn&#39;t be strictly required to work for, say, two hours straight without having even a spare minute to check the news or scratch his balls or whatever.

Any thoughts on this?</description>

I suppose, because it could be taken into a greater use of being a parent-child relationship (teachers and students, employers and employees, etc), is why I find it so fascinating.</p>
