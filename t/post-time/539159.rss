    <description>Well, It&#39;s been 2-3 weeks and I still can&#39;t post on my Project Thread to ensure it&#39;s still progressing and to update my followers on the progress. Why? Because of the Double Posting Requirement where you cannot post two times in a row. 

Resolve: Perhaps change it so you can only post every 24 hours so you can still post your progress but have to wait sometime to do so. Because I want to keep posting progress but I cannot due to the Double Post Requirement.</description>

<p>This. A bump button is a cool idea (if only visible to the person who posted the thread).</p>

It does to an extent promote people to make something of their project before posting it to ensure there’s a place to update people on the progress. However I do see where you’re coming from.</p>

<p>Situations like the above happen daily, it’s no big issue to staff because they know it’s for a good reason. The very same reason why the removing and reposting a post aren’t banned in other boards such as server development because it’s sometimes necessary for it to happen. It does need some form of script to make it more automated, however.</p>

<p>Yeah, watch your back Pwnd.</p>
<p>On a related note, I like what jme brought up in the past thread for this suggestion. You could post twice or however many times, and it would just add it to your post under a line with the post date. The thread wouldn’t be bumped but it’s still say “new” next to the thread.</p>
<p>[quote=“jme, post:4, topic:533759”]With the old system it did not bump your topic. If you double posted it would just edit your last post with a line through it to separate them. Not sure why we cant just have that again.</p>
<p>I don’t want to see any BUMP posts where the server advertisement section becomes a bumping war. But if you have a legit reason to bump your thread in the server advertisements, such as an important update, simply copy your last post, delete it, then repost it with your edit. No one’s going to have a problem with that, but it better be worthwhile and do not abuse it.[/quote]<br>
I agree with what Ruby said; its either people show interest in your thread or someone bumps the thread for you.</p>
<blockquote>A owner being able to bump their own thread once or twice a day would just lead to a server competition of who can be on top the longest. We will be stuck with the bad servers nobody comments on because they don't like them rather then the ones that are good. It makes more sense for the owner to be able to bump after a thread post rather then whenever he felt like it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Because other people can reply to your threads - if they don't reply to it then there's normally a reason why.</blockquote>

              <p>Well a lot of the time I actually like the no double posting, you either have to have interest in the project or someone to bump it for you. It does to an extent promote people to make something of their project before posting it to ensure there’s a place to update people on the progress. However I do see where you’re coming from.</p>
<p>On the fence, I suppose.</p>

              <p>Well, It’s been 2-3 weeks and I still can’t post on my Project Thread to ensure it’s still progressing and to update my followers on the progress. Why? Because of the Double Posting Requirement where you cannot post two times in a row.</p>
<p>Resolve: Perhaps change it so you can only post every 24 hours so you can still post your progress but have to wait sometime to do so. Because I want to keep posting progress but I cannot due to the Double Post Requirement.</p>
