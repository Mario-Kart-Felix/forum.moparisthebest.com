    <description>How many of you are seriously interested in sitting down and working on a 6 - 8 month project from scratch and creating an indie game? I&#39;ve been programming a game from Java for about a month now and I&#39;d love to know if there&#39;s anyone willing to help draw up pixel art, do level design, story-writing, etc. If not, maybe at least share your experiences and some good do&#39;s and don&#39;ts for indie games? Share your thoughts and pics!</description>

<p>I already have programmed the engine my friends. The engine is already done lol. It’s a lot less stressful than you may think. I have it to where the user can walk around, shoot projectiles, and talk to NPCs. I can show screenshots if you’re interested. I was really just looking for people interested in helping an already started project.</p>
