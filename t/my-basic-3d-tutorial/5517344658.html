<p>I‚Äôm intrigued. Few people venture over to the fun and frustrating area of 3D rasterization. I‚Äôm even more surprised you picked Java (though less since it‚Äôs this community). Pretty cool. I started in graphics programming from software rasterization, also. How much have you learned about hardware rendering? Also, out of curiosity, what shading model are you using with your triangle rasterizer? It looks like phong shading to me, but it‚Äôs hard to tell without more pictures. Also, are you doing perspective correct texture mapping?</p>
<p>Edit: I noticed in the other thread you mentioned you‚Äôre doing Gouraud shading, so disregard the question on shading. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Just curious, are you doing perspective-correct interpolation of other vertex attributes, as well? This is something I never see in software rasterizers (likely because it‚Äôs way too expensive). I believe Jagex didn‚Äôt do it in their rasterizers, but they were under much different performance constraints at the time.</p>
<p>Alas, accelerated graphics hardware lets us do ridiculous things. It‚Äôs a super cool topic, too. You should learn about it sometime. The problem of trying to push as many rendered pixels to the screen at once is very interesting and how they designed hardware to solve the problem is even more so. I find that much more interesting than hardware rendering libraries like DirectX and OpenGL. In fact, those libraries are pretty boring. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Shading languages are very fascinating, though. They have very similar concepts to the hardware itself (being only one abstraction above it) and are very similar to what you are doing with your low-level rendering.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, the only thing that is perspective-correct is the texture mapping. Jagex was running their 3D engine in a small 512x336 window (in the case of revision 194), this is small enough to be able to hit over 100fps without a cap. I never noticed the lack of perspective correction in RuneScape‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Hardware rendering is something I wish to learn after high school, I‚Äôm currently at the end of my junior year and I want to make this game so I can put it on my resume, haha.<br>
[/quote]<br>
That‚Äôs really awesome. I goofed off alot during my junior and senior year and didn‚Äôt really push myself to learn any more than I already knew in programming, you keep at it and you could make a difference quickly, somewhere.[/quote]<br>
Thank you! My goof off years were 8th-10th grade, I realized I need to start becoming the best programmer I could be, so now I code for about 6-7 hours every weekday and 10-14 hours on weekends.</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt think they were rendering at 100 frames per second when they were developing r194. You have to consider the time period here. Beyond that, they didn‚Äôt do a very good job at object limiting back then, meaning that more players on the screen continually tanked performance.

<p>I think it‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre working on a good project for your resume. Also consider how useful it is to have a breadth of knowledge, as well.

Sorry for the very late reply, but I find the amount of triangles the r194 engine can render pretty impressive. I believe every player model is around 500 triangles and the game world is pretty detailed too. Each blade of grass is a triangle and so are the stones and stuff. Did they use occlusion culling? That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been looking into recently but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to need it in my engine specifically.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to gauge how much it could actually render, since not only are modern CPUs much faster than mainstream CPUs were when their software engine was being used, but processors also behave a lot differently than the used to.

<p>I don‚Äôt think they were rendering at 100 frames per second when they were developing r194. You have to consider the time period here. Beyond that, they didn‚Äôt do a very good job at object limiting back then, meaning that more players on the screen continually tanked performance. So 100 fps is very much based on what‚Äôs on the screen at the time. Overall, fps isn‚Äôt a good measure of performance for their client.</p>
<p>Perspective correct vertex attributes are visually very difficult to see in most cases. If you do color interpolation or shade interpolation, it‚Äôs super hard (if not impossible) to see when interpolation is occurring in screen space or in the local space of the plane the triangle lives within. With texture mapping it‚Äôs much easier since the signal of colors being outputted by the texture mapper is some sort of pattern our eyes are able to easily recognize and discontinuities in this pattern become immediately obvious. Playing on these sorts of tricks (such as not being able to tell affine versus perspective interpolation of colors) is crucial for performance in graphics.</p>
<p>I think it‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre working on a good project for your resume. Also consider how useful it is to have a breadth of knowledge, as well. If you are adding a project that has software rasterization on your resume, surely you‚Äôre not trying to get a job as a software graphics programmer. If you‚Äôre interested in getting a job as a graphics developer in general, learn everything and do everything you can related to graphics (including the software stuff, that is a really good part of the process to understand).</p>

<p>Sorry for the very late reply, but I find the amount of triangles the r194 engine can render pretty impressive. I believe every player model is around 500 triangles and the game world is pretty detailed too. Each blade of grass is a triangle and so are the stones and stuff. Did they use occlusion culling? That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been looking into recently but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to need it in my engine specifically.<br>

Im pretty sure the r194 engine use z-sorting rather than z-buffering</p>
