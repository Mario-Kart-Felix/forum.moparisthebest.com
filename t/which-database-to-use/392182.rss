    <title>Which Database to Use?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-database-to-use/392182</link>
    <description>We are at a point where we&#39;re not sure staying with a product is the best path.  

We started developing our own database for photos, documents, correspondence etc using MS Access.  We moved to FileMaker perhaps 5 years ago. Our question is should we consider moving to some form of SQL?

We have two items prioritized:

1: To be able to use a tablet on site to sync with the camera taking digital photos, ensuring the photo matches the description and location.  The information will be entered via pull down menu&#39;s. Then hopefully back that data up while on the road or uplink to the main database.  

We currently have ~ 12000 items possible on our inspection list. Things like Window Sill, West facing, cracked but not leaking. etc.


2: To be able to access all information to

     do a conflict check on all parties to the suit/action

     be able to pull all information up on a particular job
     to be used in depositions/trials. This includes being
     able to pull all photos of west facing window leaks or
     tile cracked on first floor inspected.

     to be able to search across all data/jobs to look for
     trends or common issues. Our current data backup is
     1.6 TB and growing at about 1 TB per year.


We have done the Access then FileMaker projects mostly in house, and will probably do SQL the same way if we choose to go that way.

I&#39;m posting this in the General DB section as posting in each applications forum would get answers that favor that product. I&#39;m not looking to start a cat-fight here, but I would appreciate pro/con of one path or another if possible. We have years and a lot of money invested thus far and are simply trying to make a better/more informed decision this time around.  :}


Many Thanks</description>
