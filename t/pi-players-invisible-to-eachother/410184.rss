              <p>it may only be a problem by where you put it, like putting it in the middle of the character-equip = bad &gt;.&gt; im not sure if that would cause invisible people, but try moving it around =P and check your character files. see if there is anything strange in them. if you can post one of them [remove name and password though]</p>
<p>i got a feeling your server dosnt know how to load the character file anymore, like you added that BEFORE all of the character data, or you added it in 2 different spots in the saving vs the loading. the null name would be caused by not getting a name assigned to it- invisible people by not getting the character design initiated  correctly. this would be only if what Iâ€™m guessing is happening though.</p>
