    <description>[u][b][size=20pt]Macromedia Flash –  [/size] [/b] [/u] 

My first ever tut :D
I might make two more about flash. I might not. Who knows? :P

Ever wanted to make cool games like line rider?
Or animations like The One Ring?
Well with Macromedia Flash You Can.

In this Tut I will explain:

·	Where to download flash.

·	The Basics.

·	Some Actionscript.

·	Your First Game!


To begin with you’re going to need to download flash:

- Download the try out version from here. Note: You have to sign up to download.
- Registration Key/Serial: WPD800-52830-64832-84599
- Note: Entering this code in, unlocks all future macromedia products.

(Yes that was from Ron :P)

The Basics

This is what you’ve got to get used to. It is the flash interface.

(If you know Photoshop…then you can skip onto the next part)
 
[size=18pt][u][b]Tools[/b][/u][/size]

The Tools menu is probably the most used panel in Flash. 
Here are the main tools and their uses;

[u][b][size=18pt]Timeline[/size][/b][/u]

[img]http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/3341/timelineqy4.gif[/img]

To add a new layer click the &quot;Insert Layer&quot; icon

[img]http://img87.imageshack.us/img87/7647/insertlayerde3.gif[/img]

To rename a layer, double click a default layer name (for example &quot;Layer 1&quot; label) and 
when it changes to the text input field type in your new name. 

[img]http://img133.imageshack.us/img133/8194/renamelayermx3.gif[/img]

To add a frame (keyframe, frame, blank keyframe. Etc.)

[img]http://img170.imageshack.us/img170/7834/insertkeyframelg2.gif[/img]

[u][b][size=18pt]Actionscript[/size][/b][/u]

Basic Actionscript – 
gotoAndPlay(); - (Will go to the specified frame from the current frame)
gotoAndStop(); - (Will go to the specified frame from the current frame and stop)
nextFrame();     - (Will play the next frame)
nextScene();      - (Will play the next scene – you will learn scenes in my next tut)
play();               - (Will simply begin playing from the point the animation left off)
prevFrame();     - (Will play the previous frame)
prevScene();      - (Will play the previous scene)
stop();                - (Will stop the game/animation at the current frame)
stopAllSounds(); - (Will stop any sound that is playing – you will learn to add sound in  my third tut) 

[size=18pt][u][b]Your First Game[/b][/u][/size]

We’ll have a debate. Ill show you how to make either…
a)	A login screen
b)	Follow the line game.

Tell me which one you want and the most popular ill make.</description>

My character and enemy’s are just circles with a line to represent eyes. But down to the actionscript stuff (Keep in mind that I have only been using pbj746’s<br>
(thats his youtube name) small video tuts on youtube). I have learned quite a few basics from what he had on the tuts, but I have actually used my daring mind to take the actionscript codes he gave out, and altered them a bit and made it so i can have a few extra things. I have made a inventory, a hp bar, a mana bar &amp; exp bar(having trouble with these 2), a few action buttons. 1 that absorbs mana and gives some hp, a attack button that looks like a sword(poorly drawn), and an Area of effect or AOE(not really tho, i dont know how to set up so that it effects the enemy’s by distance, I have however set it up so it subtracts some hp from both of em). A menu opening button, and character that I can talk to(course i have the whole dynamic text thing so it shows up in the game).</p>
<p>And I have 4 problems I have to name as well… 1-<br>
I have tried to make a pause menu on frame 2(the game is on frame 1) but unfortunately, it would seem that switching frames makes me start over from the beginning of the frame, so any progression in the game i made will be lost by switching to the menu, I have no idea how to use thing that gets sent to the slots in my inventory(so i just made em be used on contact with me and made em disappear after that), so I want to learn how to do that. 2- I have no idea how to make move-able figures(u know, if i have a limbed char I can only just make his body move, but he doesn’t have any leg, arms, etc movement). 3- I did try to see if I can pick up an item and be sent to the 2nd frame with the menu(menu had the inventory slots), but to no avail the item just sat there, like a useless turd. 4- I do get experience from killing an enemy, but the way I tried to set it up at one point, I had it so by killing off the target with one of the actions gives me 40 exp, but after i killed it, it did as I wanted it to, but if i were to click it again after its hp zero’d out, it acted like I killed it again, and gave me 40 more exp.</p>
<p>Also, 3 question, how do I make it so I can lvl up?<br>
How do I make it so that I can wield items?<br>
AND IS ALL THIS PROGRESS THAT I HAVE MADE GOOD FOR AN ACTION SCRIPT NOOBY?!?!??![/quote]</p>

<p>Personally I’m sticking with flash 8, but Adobe flash CS3 says the new flash has:</p>
<p>Adobe Photoshop® and Illustrator® import<br>
Animation conversion to ActionScript™<br>
Adobe interface<br>
ActionScript 3.0 development<br>
Advanced debugger<br>
Adobe Device Central CS3<br>
Rich drawing capabilities<br>
User interface components<br>
Advanced QuickTime export<br>
Sophisticated video tools<br>
Timesaving coding tools</p>
<p>-Lol, not really worth the 200 dollar upgrade from previous versions.</p>

<p>My first ever tut <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I might make two more about flash. I might not. Who knows? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Ever wanted to make cool games like line rider?<br>
Or animations like The One Ring?<br>
Well with Macromedia Flash You Can.</p>
<p>In this Tut I will explain:</p>
<p>·	Where to download flash.</p>
<p>·	The Basics.</p>
<p>·	Some Actionscript.</p>
<p>·	Your First Game!</p>
<p>To begin with you’re going to need to download flash:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the try out version from here. Note: You have to sign up to download.</li>
<li>Registration Key/Serial: WPD800-52830-64832-84599</li>
<li>Note: Entering this code in, unlocks all future macromedia products.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Yes that was from Ron :P)</p>
<p>The Basics</p>
<p>This is what you’ve got to get used to. It is the flash interface.</p>

<p>(If you know Photoshop…then you can skip onto the next part)</p>
<p>[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Tools</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>The Tools menu is probably the most used panel in Flash.<br>
Here are the main tools and their uses;</p>

<p><img src="http://img87.imageshack.us/img87/7647/insertlayerde3.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>To rename a layer, double click a default layer name (for example “Layer 1” label) and<br>

<p><img src="http://img133.imageshack.us/img133/8194/renamelayermx3.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>To add a frame (keyframe, frame, blank keyframe. Etc.)</p>
<p><img src="http://img170.imageshack.us/img170/7834/insertkeyframelg2.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">[size=18pt]Actionscript[/size]</span></span></p>
<p>Basic Actionscript –<br>
gotoAndPlay(); - (Will go to the specified frame from the current frame)<br>
gotoAndStop(); - (Will go to the specified frame from the current frame and stop)<br>
nextFrame();     - (Will play the next frame)<br>
nextScene();      - (Will play the next scene – you will learn scenes in my next tut)<br>
play();               - (Will simply begin playing from the point the animation left off)<br>
prevFrame();     - (Will play the previous frame)<br>
prevScene();      - (Will play the previous scene)<br>
stop();                - (Will stop the game/animation at the current frame)<br>
stopAllSounds(); - (Will stop any sound that is playing – you will learn to add sound in  my third tut)</p>
<p>[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Your First Game</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>We’ll have a debate. Ill show you how to make either…<br>
a)	A login screen<br>
b)	Follow the line game.</p>
<p>Tell me which one you want and the most popular ill make.</p>
