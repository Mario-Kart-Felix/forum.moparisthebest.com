Want to get rid of terrorists then force Americans by law to be baptized and converted to Muslim religion. Then when terrorists come and try to attack tell em you are attacking people of Allah and Allah won’t be proud of you problem solved… Not like you have to believe you are actually part of the religion at heart just go with the flow.<br>

Interestingly, Saddam Hussain appears to have used it on muslims.[/quote]</p>
<p>WP was only an example. I’m sure you’re aware of the many terrifying circumstances certain Muslim countries have faced in the past century. For example, the establishment of the state of Israel by the eviction of Palestinians from their land or the numerous massacres committed by Israel:</p>

 The Qibya massacre, also known as the Qibya incident, occurred during "Operation Shoshana", a reprisal operation that occurred in October 1953 when Israeli troops under Ariel Sharon attacked the village of Qibya in the West Bank. At least sixty-nine Palestinian villagers were killed, two-thirds of them women and children. Forty-five houses, a school, and a mosque were destroyed. The attack followed cross-border raids from the Jordanian occupied West Bank and I...</p>

<p>I’m sure you’re also aware that most of the Arab regimes today are very oppressive and openly torture their people for criticizing them. This isn’t done under any religious pretext, rather it’s solely aimed at preserving the regime in power.</p>
<p>Whilst there are almost two billion muslims in the world, you only see a tiny minority of them forming groups like al-qaeda and carrying out suicide bombings.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:45, topic:334769”]The article separates religion <span class="bbcode-i">motivating</span> conflict, and religion be used as a <span class="bbcode-i">weapon</span> in conflict.<br>
The use of white phosphorus on muslims only <span class="bbcode-i">motivated</span> the use of the weapon of religion on westerners.[/quote]</p>
<p>People were oppressed and they turned to their religion which in turn told them to react and resist. The sole cause of the problem is people being oppressed in the first place, not religion.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:45, topic:334769”]But you have to ask <span class="bbcode-i">why</span> the westerners used it on muslims in the first place? Its because of the religious divisions in the people there. Why else would jews want to settle in a pointless stupid desert where they are, no kidding, <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Facts%20About%20Israel/Land/Israel-s%20Chronic%20Water%20Problem" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">running out of water</a>.<br>
There’s no gold, no oil, no notable natural resources of any kind. The only reason anyone wants to go there is because they believe an archangel re-dictated parts of the Old and New testament to an illiterate businessman. Or they believe somebody acquired two stone tablets with 10 rules written on it.[/quote]<br>
That is why the Jews want Palestine. You can’t look at the actions of one religion and label all other religions the same. That would be irrational.</p>
<p>Religion is a general term and refers to many different and diverse beliefs which are mostly unrelated.</p>
<p>Palestine belongs to the arabs because it is clearly inside arab territory. The people of Palestine (jews, christians and muslims alike) have been arabs for centuries until some European jews decided it was their’s. It’s only those jews that claim a right to Palestine through religious principals.</p>

              <p>That wikipedia page appears to say that the first time WP was used on muslims was in Iraq in 2004. It seems when that article was published and when September 11th happened, westerners had not yet used WP on muslims in the middle-east.<br>
Interestingly, Saddam Hussain appears to have used it on muslims.</p>
<p>The article separates religion <span class="bbcode-i">motivating</span> conflict, and religion be used as a <span class="bbcode-i">weapon</span> in conflict.<br>
The use of white phosphorus on muslims only <span class="bbcode-i">motivated</span> the use of the weapon of religion on westerners.</p>
<p>But you have to ask <span class="bbcode-i">why</span> the westerners used it on muslims in the first place? Its because of the religious divisions in the people there. Why else would jews want to settle in a pointless stupid desert where they are, no kidding, <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Facts%20About%20Israel/Land/Israel-s%20Chronic%20Water%20Problem" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">running out of water</a>.<br>
There’s no gold, no oil, no notable natural resources of any kind. The only reason anyone wants to go there is because they believe an archangel re-dictated parts of the Old and New testament to an illiterate businessman. Or they believe somebody acquired two stone tablets with 10 rules written on it.</p>
<blockquote>Religion is also, of course, the underlying source of the divisiveness in the Middle East which motivated the use of this deadly weapon in the first place.</blockquote>
<p>Removing religion would take away one of the greatest weapons from the terrorists. It would also remove their motivation to use <span class="bbcode-i">any</span> weapon.</p>
<p>If you completely removed religion, then ran history all over again, the middle east would be peaceful.</p>

<p>I can’t explain it that well but I have a newspaper article here published 15th September 2001. If you read it, it will give you insight into how and why I think removing religion would stop suicide bombers. I think it is very relevant to this discussion.<br>

The problem with that article is that it seems to ignore circumstantial factors.</p>
<p>Don’t forget the atrocities which Muslims have faced that compelled them to resort to suicide bombing. Do you know what weapons grade white phosphorus can do to people? The Americans used it in Afghanistan and Fallujah and the Israelis used it in Gaza and Lebanon. In almost all of those cases it was used on civilian populations. If anyone is forced to watch their family members burn to death, is it surprising that he would want to become a suicide bomber?</p>

Elemental phosphorus can exist in several allotropes, the most common of which are white and red solids. Solid violet and black allotropes are also known.  Gaseous phosphorus exists as diphosphorus and atomic phosphorus. White phosphorus, yellow phosphorus or simply tetraphosphorus (P4) exists as molecules made up of four atoms in a tetrahedral structure. The tetrahedral arrangement results in ring strain and instability. The molecule is described as consisting of six single P–P bonds. Two diffe...</p>
