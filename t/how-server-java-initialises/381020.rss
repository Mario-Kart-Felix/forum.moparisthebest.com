    <title>How server.java initialises</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-server-java-initialises/381020</link>
    <description>well thanks to i vain i completely ive actually managed to learn quite abit about servers(317), anyways i looked over the main method in server.java and this is what i see its doing (tell me if im wrong and correct me please).

btw: i dled a delta base to look at the server.java, so this is deltas server.java...

-----------
1st. a new file is declared, that being server.ini.

2nd. the server&#39;s properties are parsed into ints.

3rd. the client is checked if its the right one.

4th. the server constructor is called in...a thread? im not sure, heres the code..

[code]clientHandler = new server();
		(new Thread(clientHandler)).start(); // launch server listener[/code]

5. a crap load of files are initialised.

6.  thats as far as ive come to because the server const. is empty, so i dont get it, where is the cache &amp; mapdata &amp; 3d models used/loaded?</description>
