    <description>Revision: 317
Source: Delta

It seems for some strange reason some of my classes have stopped working. clickingMost (works for a few in-game buttons), potions (none of the case(s) work). Now I&#39;ve come to the conclusion it must be something with the new handler&#39;s I&#39;ve been making for my source. I&#39;ve made custom agility (being the most recent), Herblore, started a Firemaking class, and everything was good until I reached the last class I made. The agility one. I&#39;m sure this problem can be fixed, but I just don&#39;t know, nor understand how-to. Would someone please mind elaborating on the problem, and possibly explain a fix? Any [b]HELP[/b] is appreciated. Thank you.

Edit: Could it be as simple as me having to update my java? I&#39;m using 7, build 51.

Compiling error:

              <p>Can we see how you implemented the agility? Have you tried removing the instance (Assuming that’s how you did it) from Server class?</p>

              <p>Absolutely a point in the right direction man, looks like I may have been onto something with a different jdk version. But the problem is still lingering. Thanks for the link, I’ll try to figure something out. Anyone else got a say?</p>

It almost seems like an error you’d get when… Well, you’ve <span class="bbcode-u">somewhat</span> coded things right, but something in there is making it go, “AHHHHHHHHHHHHH, WTF…”, and throwing the whole compiling process off (as I said, some things don’t work).
