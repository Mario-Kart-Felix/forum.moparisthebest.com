    <title>Why is there so much hate in the community?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-is-there-so-much-hate-in-the-community/295857</link>
    <description>Most people here are really smart, so smart that they know Java. A good amount of the RS community itself knows Java or some sort of programming language or has some sort of graphical expertise. So my question is why is there so much hate then? why can&#39;t we be equal or think of a better way to get things done? The private server community could be so much better but the servers don&#39;t last long enough due to competition.

As an example today I finally found a half decent server. Little bit of lag but nothing serious. Only custom there was were D Claws (and D Claws in a 508 really isn&#39;t a custom.) it was a Berkyscape clone too, I love Berkyscape (and Davidscape for that matter). But it was decently challenging, you couldn&#39;t just get GS as a drop, you needed to get the shards and make the GS. It had real game physics and wasn&#39;t entirely focused on PKing.

So someone comes along and doesn&#39;t like how we&#39;re enjoying ourselves so he DoS&#39;d the server. I still can&#39;t get on like 30 minutes after this happened and it&#39;s really annoying me. The community was very good and every time this always happens.

So what I&#39;m saying is why can&#39;t server creators just keep the servers closed source. and just give out the Clients. It would be way better this way and people would enjoy it more.</description>

<p>But everyone here thinks people “leech” off of them, when its not possible, thats only because EVERY private server is leeched from <a href="http://runescape.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Runescape</a> but they still think moving stuff around or adding items/npc’s makes it special even tho it doesn’t.</p>

              <p>Most people here are really smart, so smart that they know Java. A good amount of the RS community itself knows Java or some sort of programming language or has some sort of graphical expertise. So my question is why is there so much hate then? why can’t we be equal or think of a better way to get things done? The private server community could be so much better but the servers don’t last long enough due to competition.</p>
<p>As an example today I finally found a half decent server. Little bit of lag but nothing serious. Only custom there was were D Claws (and D Claws in a 508 really isn’t a custom.) it was a Berkyscape clone too, I love Berkyscape (and Davidscape for that matter). But it was decently challenging, you couldn’t just get GS as a drop, you needed to get the shards and make the GS. It had real game physics and wasn’t entirely focused on PKing.</p>
<p>So someone comes along and doesn’t like how we’re enjoying ourselves so he DoS’d the server. I still can’t get on like 30 minutes after this happened and it’s really annoying me. The community was very good and every time this always happens.</p>
<p>So what I’m saying is why can’t server creators just keep the servers closed source. and just give out the Clients. It would be way better this way and people would enjoy it more.</p>
