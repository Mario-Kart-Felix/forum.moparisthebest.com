    <title>How can I use BufferedReader/Writer to remove one line then write something new?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-use-bufferedreader-writer-to-remove-one-line-then-write-something-new/472978</link>
    <description>[This is actually to rsps but I don&#39;t think I will get an answer in that thread about this..]

As the title says!  

I am trying to make a custom expanded command.
That needs several classes.
I am just messing around in my class and hope for the best that it will work..
If you want to see the class.. I have to kill you first.. because it is a real mess..

Add me on skype.. name: addemod

EDIT:
I can explain better.

When I do a command, etc. ::position
I want it to write out the playername and the position the player is on.
Then if the player does the command again, I want just HIS line to be removed then make a new line with his information.
That means, I want to update his position in the file. Without making a new row or affecting the other rows..?

Understand?</description>

              <p>You can do this easily by using a database. MySQL is probably the most notorious, although it would require learning basic SQL. By using a database, you are capable of efficiently storing large amounts of data at a quick rate. This solution sounds like it’s a little bit to ‘advanced’ for you at this time. Maybe you will find it useful in the future.</p>

change the line(s) accordingly.</p>
<p>This seems inefficient though, why would you want to keep track of player commands? :o<br>
You could also just make a raw list and then orden it later on o.o</p>

              <p>i guess you mean that you want to have all the rows be unique to each player that does the command?</p>
<p>you can accomplish that by searching (or indexing, but that’s a bit advance) through the file and if you can find a player’s username, seek to the beginning of the line and write over that data or if you can’t find an entry then append.</p>
<p>randomaccessstream etc.</p>
<p>i don’t really understand your question because it’s not worded very clearly but wouldn’t a database be better suited for this? it literally does everything you’re asking and about a billion things more.</p>
