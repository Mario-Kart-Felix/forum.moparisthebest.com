    <title>How can I use BufferedReader/Writer to remove one line then write something new?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-use-bufferedreader-writer-to-remove-one-line-then-write-something-new/472977</link>
    <description>As the title says!  :eek:

I am trying to make a custom expanded command.
That needs several classes.
I am just messing around in my class and hope for the best that it will work..
If you want to see the class.. I have to kill you first.. because it is a real mess..

Add me on skype.. name: addemod

EDIT:
I can explain better.

When I do a command, etc. ::position
I want it to write out the playername and the position the player is on.
Then if the player does the command again, I want just HIS line to be removed then make a new line with his name.

Understand?  :P</description>

Look into how the Reader/Writer works. Also, take a look at the ban commands…</p>
