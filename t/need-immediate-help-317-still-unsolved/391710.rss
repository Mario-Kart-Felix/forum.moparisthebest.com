    <title>NEED IMMEDIATE HELP! [317] (still Unsolved)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-immediate-help-317-still-unsolved/391710</link>
    <description>So i know 2 ways to run my server that are supposed to work.
1. Automatic portforwarding (upnp) -- used the tut in server tuts. and that is what i used for a few weeks for my server and it worked for a good time and i liked the whole no utorrent stuff, then it crashed.. and now it wont work and i get a compiling error (showin in pic at bottom)

2. Using Utorrent -- I know exactly how to use this, had to use it for months before i figured out how to get the Automatic port forwarding to work (above). but i was still satisfied because my server was up and yadada.. Now it won&#39;t work. I used to be able to log-in to my normal ip (skibblez.no-ip.biz) instead of using host (127.0.0.1) because if you use host it doesn&#39;t tell you if it is actually on. 

So can someone please help me. I have tried everything
I did make sure these were working:
1. my port was open (43594, verified on canyouseeme.org)
2. my ip address matched the one opening port 43594 (sometimes it likes to change)
3. All the information was entered correctly.
4. Utorrent was running and server would start without the port already in use message.
5. no compiling errors (except in the first part, self explanatory)
6. my no-ip was working
^thats all i can think of trying. anyone got a solution? pm me if u need to do teamviewer</description>
