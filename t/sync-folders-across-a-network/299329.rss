    <title>Sync folders across a network</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sync-folders-across-a-network/299329</link>
    <description>
So I find myself more often than not copying the same folders across computers because I update things. Mainly when I model on my laptop while I&#39;m out somewhere and come home to test out renders across my farm.

It&#39;s getting pretty old.

There&#39;s got to be some software that can let me choose a &quot;shared&quot; kinda folder where everytime I ask it to it copies the updated contents to the other computers on the network.

I remember a few programs using SVN to update, and I was wondering if I could use that but have it downloading from the network instead of an internet source. Anyone familiar with anything like this?</description>

<p>But now that you’ve changed the course of the thread…</p>
<p>While I’m at school I used to use logmein to check the status of my renders or render something else on my home computer. Well I have a newer home computer and it’s not working anymore. I deleted the old logmein computer from the logmein site and installed the software on my new computer (Windows 7 computer) and it says it’s online and the logmein software is on and in the toolbar.</p>
<p>I connect to it from my other computer and it connects and then has a logmein login window that tells me how long the computer has been inactive and prompts me for a username and password, saying it’s the windows username and password. Well I type in my windows username and password and after a few seconds it pops up and says unknown or bad username or password.</p>
<p>What the heck.</p>

              <p>Okay deltacopy isn’t exactly working. I planned on setting up my desktop as the server so I can mainly work from my laptop, and then backup to the desktop when I need to work on it from there.</p>
<p>Well, when I start the server on there, it says to enter the .\username and password or the DomainName\Username and password. No matter what I put in it says service creation failed unknown error.</p>
<p>So I tried the server on my laptop. If I put in my computer’s username and password, it says the service was registered successfully, but when I click start server it says it fails because the username password are incorrect, and I need to change it. Well there’s no option to change it.</p>
<p>So now I try rsync with cygwin?</p>
<p>UPDATE: Actually briefcase works much better for me, I was doing it wrong &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p>I copied the briefcase to another computer and when I tried to sync it I didn’t realize I could change what replaces what.</p>
<p>The actual way to do it is to put it in a briefcase and move it to the other computer, cause the briefcase syncs with the folder you copied into the briefcase, not a copy of a briefcase. And on top of that, it lists what changed, and you can replace them either way or ignore them.</p>

<p>Yes you can do it manually, just run the rsync command anytime you want to do it.  And you can do it to/from either computer.</p>

<p>Yep, even down to parts of files, if only part of a file changes. This is basically what it is designed for, a typical use of rsync is creating mirror servers, and keeping them syncd with the main server.</p>

<p>rsync is a software application for Unix systems which synchronizes files and directories from one location to another while minimizing data transfer using delta encoding when appropriate. An important feature of rsync not found in most similar programs/protocols is that the mirroring takes place with only one transmission in each direction. rsync can copy or display directory contents and copy files, optionally using compression and recursion.</p>

</aside>
<p>unfortunately you cant use rsync itself on windows properly, there are windows ports however. google “rsync for windows”[/quote]</p>
<p>Just install cygwin, and rsync is available through that. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>EDIT: Well I ran into a weird problem. On my laptop I made the briefcase and copied it to my server computer. From there I made lots of adjustments and stuff. On the laptop I tried to sync and it said there’s nothing that has changed that could be synced with, but on the server if I tried to sync it popped up showing everything that had changed and what I wanted to sync, but it was backwards of what I wanted to do, it was asking if I wanted to replace the files on the server with the files from the laptop.</p>
<p>In the help files it sounded like you could do it both ways, but I guess next time I’ll make the briefcase on the desktop.</p>

              <p>Frell I’m not talking about shared things. I’m not trying to access the same files across the network and save them to a central location somewhere else on the network. I’m trying to have the same files on multiple computers across the network, and if I make changes to any of them, have the option to sync the others to this one.</p>
<p>I guess I’ll try either rsync or svn of some sort.</p>

<p>To SVN, and any other program for that matter, intranet and internet are the same thing. SVN works great over intranet. You will have to set up an SVN server, which is fairly trivial to do.</p>

              <p>rsync is the real tool for this job.</p>
<blockquote>rsync is a software application for Unix systems which synchronizes files and directories from one location to another while minimizing data transfer using delta encoding when appropriate. An important feature of rsync not found in most similar programs/protocols is that the mirroring takes place with only one transmission in each direction. rsync can copy or display directory contents and copy files, optionally using compression and recursion.</blockquote>
<p>unfortunately you cant use rsync itself on windows properly, there are windows ports however. google “rsync for windows”</p>

              <p>Im sure you can have a ‘models folder’ on your network where all computers on your network can access the folder. Try flag+e, hit network and find your computer. Inside should be a public folder where you can move stuff to be accessible via network. Thats all i can think of off the top of my head, though.</p>

              <p>So I find myself more often than not copying the same folders across computers because I update things. Mainly when I model on my laptop while I’m out somewhere and come home to test out renders across my farm.</p>
<p>It’s getting pretty old.</p>
