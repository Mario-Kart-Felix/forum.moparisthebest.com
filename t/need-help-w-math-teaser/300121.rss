    <description>Well here it is

&quot;A family (Dad, Mom, Son &amp; daughter) need to get through a VERY dark tunnel. Dad can make it in 1 minute, the Mom in 2 minutes, the Son in 4 minutes and the Daughter in 5 minutes. Only 2 people can go through the tunnel at one time. They can only move at the speed of the slowest person. When ever going through the dark, scary tunnel they have to carry a burning torch with them. The problem is the torch will only last for 12 minutes.&quot;

It can be done, I just cant figure it out..

EXAMPLE: dad and mom go it takes them 2 mins [ moms slowest speed]

Edit: Nvm got it</description>
