    <description>Base: Delta*
*I have totally cleaned the DeltaScape source and added proper conventions. The source is FAR more stable now. Also, I have configured the source to work with any client including Galkon&#39;s Refractored, 317 Deob and even Silab client.

Now you must fill out this short form to apply.
[code]Age:
Time Zone:
Experience:
MSN (yes, you must have MSN):
Extra Info (optional):[/code]

I am looking for someone who is good with clients especially, as I am not good with them. Server wise, I don&#39;t mind if you are not the most experienced. You don&#39;t have to be an expert on Java because I am not either. Client sided I want new GS stances, walking anims, running anims and proper specials. And maybe the new attack interfaces. Everyone who helps develops the server will get a co owner/admin position when the server releases. I plan to buy a VPS for it when it is ready. 

Here are a few pictures of my progress. Note: This isn&#39;t all I have done.

As you can see the spec hits much faster now.
