              <p>Junky, I’ve had this problem before. Use what I do, it works most of the time (80% of the time)</p>
<p>Step 1. Delete your No-IP adress<br>
Step 2. Add it again<br>
Step 3. Make a No-IP group named something like MoparScape<br>
Step 4. Add your server IP to the group<br>
Step 5. Try logging into your server</p>
<p>It works for me all the time actually. Lets hope it works for you. And, it might not work for you because I didn’t have to port-forward since I don’t have a router.</p>
