    <title>Problem with battlescape 317 client windows 7</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-battlescape-317-client-windows-7/354545</link>
    <description>I&#39;m making another server, and my friend (co-owner of the server) is trying to get on. (I have a few years of experience with servers, so I know everything&#39;s right on my side), but he has a problem loading the server client (based off of battlescape 317) on his windows seven laptop. On xp it runs fine for him, but I think there&#39;s an OS based issue. One of my admins is also having a similar issue with his laptop (you guessed it, windows seven). Does anybody have a fixed .bat file for running the client?

Here is my client&#39;s .bat:
[code]@echo off
cd files
Start javaw -Xmx500M client 82 highmem
exit
[/code]</description>
