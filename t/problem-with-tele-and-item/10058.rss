    <title>Problem with ::tele and ::item</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-tele-and-item/10058</link>
    <description>well today i did a system restore, because there was something wrong in my client.java file which i couldn&#39;t find to fix.

anyway, after the system restore i had all my TestScape sources, files etc. but this time when I played it the ::tele , ::item and ::pickup commands did not work. I made my username have owner rights (3), but i still was not able to use those commands.

I&#39;m basicallly looking for any codes or procedures for regaining those commands.

Any help would be appreciated.</description>
