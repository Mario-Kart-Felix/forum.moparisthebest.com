    <title>Network SAM?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/network-sam/67843</link>
    <description>Today at school I attempted to capture a SAM file (wndows password file) on one of their many computers in the network. When I decrypted the SAM File at home I discovered none of the 200+ users were in this file. Is it possible that there is some sort of SAM File in another directory on the computer or on the network. If so, where? Also, I cant do anything major because I&#39;m have a limited user account.</description>

<p>rofl, I wish that my teachers were that dumb, well I suppose they are. The guest account at my school is whguest (West High) and the password is 12345. I was just messing around and all the sudden it logged me in, the guest has more privileges than a regular student though.<br>

<p>He wasn’t dumb, actually, the linux machines had multiple desktop sessions to choose from, and everyone didn’t know shit about linux pc’s so they couldn’t do much. The PC’s logged what user logs in and what it does in key places so he would know anyway.[/quote]<br>
Yeah, dumb wasn’t the word I was really looking for it just came to mind, lol sorry if I offended you. :o</p>

</aside>
<p>It can be found on the hard drive in the folder %systemroot%system32config. However this folder is locked to all accounts including Administrator while the machine is running. The only account that can access the SAM file during operation is the “System” account.</p>

              <p>Well the way my school’s computers are set up the SAM file would be of no use for getting into anything besides one of the many workstations. Each individual has there own HD partition on the network and that is accessed remotely. I assume that your computers there would be similar because it wouldn’t make much sense to add a whole schools worth of logins to each computer. The SAM file would only benefit you if you wanted to login to the certain workstation.</p>
