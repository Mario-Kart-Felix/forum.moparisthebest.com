    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ports-done-wrong/352815</link>
    <description>ok well i&#39;ve got my no-ip and ive done portforwarding, i think, correctly. i can log into my server with 127.0.0.1 (local) but when i try to log onto it with my no-ip, it says error connecting to server. and when i got to canyouseeme.org it says it cant see my ports or whatever, reason: connection timed out. sometimes its different and it says reason: connection refused. i have also allowed the port (43594) through my firewall. anyone know whats going wrong here? 
All help appreciated =)</description>
