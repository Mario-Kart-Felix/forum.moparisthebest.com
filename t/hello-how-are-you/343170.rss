    <title>Hello. How are you?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hello-how-are-you/343170</link>
    <description>You may all remember me as a thief, a friend, a liar, an idiot.. or just a plain ol&#39; asshole right?

Well, yes you are right. After a few months of life changing... things I&#39;ve actually changed my self...

I know I shouldn&#39;t be coming on here to write a huge paragraph about my life story or what not, and I know nobody cares, but I just feel as if this should be out there..

So here it goes.

Back then... yes I did do some dirty things, I did lie and I was an asshole, and I am sorry which is how you can lose a community that solely trusts you, I was going through some rough times that I am out of now, and no I wasn&#39;t on a job.

I lived in Montreal, a place where I shouldn&#39;t have been because I couldn&#39;t even speak fucking french, I had no job because of the communication issues and barely any money for rent. I recently moved out of there, back to my family where I now have a job as a Swamper, (Assistant for oil rig truck drivers) and live with a friend. It&#39;s great, to be honest.. to actually have a job. Having a life is fun.

Now, I know this is either going to get deleted, and what not and all that.. But I just wanted to let you know I am sorry, to the WHOLE RSC Community, I know 99% of you probably hate me and yep..

Enjoy RSC ^_^</description>

<p>On topic - Edward. Links were removed, thanks once again.[/quote]<br>
Too bad I don’t DDoS, nor have I ever DDoS’d.</p>
<p>As for the links, they shouldn’t have been there in the first place.  You shouldn’t even be allowed on here, or anywhere for that matter.</p>

              <p>You may all remember me as a thief, a friend, a liar, an idiot… or just a plain ol’ asshole right?</p>
<p>Well, yes you are right. After a few months of life changing… things I’ve actually changed my self…</p>
<p>I know I shouldn’t be coming on here to write a huge paragraph about my life story or what not, and I know nobody cares, but I just feel as if this should be out there…</p>
<p>So here it goes.</p>
<p>Back then… yes I did do some dirty things, I did lie and I was an asshole, and I am sorry which is how you can lose a community that solely trusts you, I was going through some rough times that I am out of now, and no I wasn’t on a job.</p>
<p>I lived in Montreal, a place where I shouldn’t have been because I couldn’t even speak fucking french, I had no job because of the communication issues and barely any money for rent. I recently moved out of there, back to my family where I now have a job as a Swamper, (Assistant for oil rig truck drivers) and live with a friend. It’s great, to be honest… to actually have a job. Having a life is fun.</p>
<p>Now, I know this is either going to get deleted, and what not and all that… But I just wanted to let you know I am sorry, to the WHOLE RSC Community, I know 99% of you probably hate me and yep…</p>
<p>Enjoy RSC <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
