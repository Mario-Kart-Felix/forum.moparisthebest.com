    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-would-host-there-website-with-a-new-upcoming-host/318604</link>
    <description>Me and a friend purchased a dedicated server, we are setting it up at the moment. But, we kinda want to know if we are going the right way with prices.

This host will be up Mid-December early January. We are professional hoster&#39;s , that split up from another hosting company and are now making our own.

We want the best prices people can find so we have came up with the following.

Package 1: $3
Disk Space: 2500 MB 
Bandwidth: 6000 MB

Package 2: $4
Disk Space: 6000 MB
Bandwidth: 12000MB

Package 3: $5 (If we can&#39;t do it, you get your money back guaranteed + $5)
Disk Space: Unlimited
Bandwidth: Unlimited

All packages will also include:
Guaranteed 99.9% Uptime
24/7 Support
Daily Site Backups
cPanel (Comes with all the pre configured scripts etc)
Email Spam Filters
Email Virus Protection
Webmail Access
IMAP Support
Email Forwarders
Email Auto Responders
Email Box Trappers
Unlimited Sub-Domains
Unlimited POP-3 Email Accounts
Unlimited Email Listings
Unlimited MySQL Databases
Unlimited PostgreSQL Databases
Unlimited FTP Accounts
... and more

Any feedback would be nice. Such as what your looking for in a host, the price range your in and the things you need.</description>

That’s a sexy server mopar. Tell me, what is the difference between Apache and Light-HTTPD?<br>
[/quote]Lighttpd is less resource intensive as apache.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not just less resource intensive, but also much faster, and the configuration files are more robust.  It runs much better than apache ever can, due to limitations of the design decisions.</p>

We have everything set up right we aren’t new to this. Also we have thought about going with a soft layer dedi with your specs. I didn’t put version numbers, but everything is up to date as we just installed everything not to long ago. Instead of lighttpd we are using apache though[/quote]</p>
<p>I use gigenet as a host, and don’t have many complaints with them so far.</p>
<p>As to version numbers though, I’m not talking about specific numbers.  But ‘up to date’ doesn’t tell anyone anything.  There is a latest version of apache 2 and of apache 1.3.  There is a latest version of MySQL 3, 4, and 5, of PHP 4 and 5, of Python 2.5, 2.6, and 3.  All of these versions are very different where software written for one won’t run on another, this stuff needs to be published before anyone will buy hosting from you.</p>

<p>I would say not enough information.  What operating system?  What software?  What is the hardware like and the connections speed?  Are you going to limit the number of accounts you put on a single server, or will you overload it?

<p>A new upcoming web host is fine, but if you don’t have the answers to these questions and more or a plan to address all of the issues that inevitably come up with a web host, then you aren’t ready and you will fail.

<p>I don’t see any version numbers, also you don’t mention any web server software, though I assume you will have one running?

Intel Xeon 3360<br>
8 GB of RAM<br>
2TB (can get more on request, we figured since we are small no point in paying for more until thats used up)<br>
No SSH will be offered.</p>
<p>We will get the limit that we can out of that server and of course then set up another one.</p>
<p>Also, We scrapped up enough earnings to afford this dedi for about a year. So if all else fails we come out even.</p>
