<p>I’m not quite sure I understood your first question, so if I don’t accurately answer it, my apologies. Nonetheless, from what I understood, yes you’ll need to download the essentials. It’s a bare-boned virtual server. Java, UI (unless you’re okay with shell commands), and various other programs may need to be installed as well as the server you’re hosting on it.</p>
<p>Completely opinionated. I used MyHosting quite a while back though, I loved them. They had a wonderful 24/7, free troubleshoot hotline that came in handy when I was doing DDoS’d.</p>
<p>I believe a Walmart Cart can only be used on <a href="http://Walmart.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Walmart.com</a>. If so, no. If not, then possibly.<br>

<p>umm would the program be able to instal without admin permisson?<br>
because my dad has admin program on my comp, and i cant dl for shit</p>
<p>and i meant paypal card brought from walmart[/quote]</p>
<p>Those programs would be installed on the VPS, not your home computer. The only thing that you would be installing on your home computer you would just have to have a terminal to access the VPS. So, yes you would have to have Administrative rights on your computer. Unless you’re buying a pricier VPS which might have different alternatives (I went with the basics).</p>
<p>Yes, you can purchase a VPS with PayPal. However, it’s a recurring monthly payment, so that might become tedious.</p>
