              <p>If “you” can’t log on with the ip it gives you at <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.whatismyip.com</a> then nobody can get on. You have a port forward problem. To your problem where you said it worked the day before, if you lost connection at all or restarted your computer, it might have changed your computer’s ip, thus you needing to port forward again. I had that problem and it’s only happened twice to me in 4 months.</p>
