    <title>Native Methods</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/native-methods/226657</link>
    <description>Hello.
I came across the term Native Methods while reading and i have a few questions :)
1) The book suggested that the Methods be programmed in C but is that totally necassary?
2) What are the advantages to using Native Methods
3) How does it effect the preformance?

Thank you in advance</description>

Native methods do not have to be programmed necessarily in C. Languages such as D, assembly and C++ should also work. The advantage of Native methods are the performance and the use with Java. Where Java cannot perform a task, JNI can help you do. JNI is often used for time critical situations. If used properly, you code may run at the same speed as C. The only drawback you may find with performance reasons is loading the Library. There are also disadvantages such as platform-dependant code, your code will also have to have extra runtime support such as destructors, memory allocation(malloc/free if on C|new/delete for C++). Exception and error checking since Java will not handle external code.</p>
