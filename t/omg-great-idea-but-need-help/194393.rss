    <title>OMG great idea, but need help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/omg-great-idea-but-need-help/194393</link>
    <description>OMG i had the best idea for a server, i&#39;m like pooping my pants right now it&#39;s such a good idea!!!!!1!!1!! &gt;_&lt;
But before i can get this server going correctly, i need some(mabey alot) of help. I&#39;m gonna have a list of questions so please quote the question you are answering.

1.
How would i time waves of NPCs spawning at a certain spot?

2.
How would i have said NPCs move towards a certain spot?

3.
How would i have those NPCs that are moving to that objective engage any player there or on the way there?

4.
Is it possible to have stationary NPCs wander around a set number of squares and move to engage a player within another pre-determined area?

5.
I&#39;m pretty sure this is possible, but to be sure, can i change the speed at which an NPC walks, and if you do get hit you die in 1 minute regardless of health unless you drink an antidote?

6.
Is it possible to when an NPC sees a player and moves to engage him/her, all other NPCs of the same kind move in to engage that player as well?

7.
I know im asking alot, and that no server base is perfect, so am i better off using a blnak server, or just heavily modify a base. Please know that i have very limited coding experience, but i am willing to learn.

8.(i hate to edit so soon but i have some new questions ;)
Is it possible to have a code in the server to change the server address, IE i click on the teleport orb, it logs me out and connects me to a completely different server.

9.This is a VERY radical new idea, but would it be possible to set up a server like a peer-to-peer network so that there is no centralized server, so much more bandwith could be utilized?

10.
Is it possible to have when a NPC dies it leaves a corpse?

11.
along the lines of 10, is it possible to add in some gore like if someone gets killed their arm or head falls off?

Sorry im asking so many questions, but if i get this server working like i want it will be well worth it!</description>
