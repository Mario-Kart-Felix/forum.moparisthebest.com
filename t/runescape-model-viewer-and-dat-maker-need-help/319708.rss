    <title>Runescape Model Viewer and Dat maker Need help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-model-viewer-and-dat-maker-need-help/319708</link>
    <description>I know how to do everything so don&#39;t tell me look up a tutorial. Here&#39;s when the problem comes into play, every time i try to open RSModel viewer nothing opens? I remember along time ago on my other computer I would use it all the time. So I downloaded it and tryed opening it. But nothing ever pops up? So ive tried restarting computer and nothing pops up, then i tried downloading it on a different link and other peoples versions. None of them every pop up? I downloaded and extracted. But nothing... the other thing pops up that allows you edit it, but you can&#39;t edit nothing without having the model converted.. And to convert the model you have to open rsmodel viewer. That program with the wizard hat... See I know it worked before and I&#39;m trying now... I have tried and ran out of options other then post on moparscape and ask for help. So someone please help me! The only other option beside this is yahoo answers, but no one on yahoo answers play runescape. And rarely private servers, then for them to know how to make models and stuff is slim! So someone please help!</description>
