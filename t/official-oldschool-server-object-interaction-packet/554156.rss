    <title>[Official Oldschool Server] Object interaction packet?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/official-oldschool-server-object-interaction-packet/554156</link>
    <description>Im not sure where to ask about this but I figured there&#39;d be someone on here who can answer my question. 

I am trying to figure out how to make a client interact with an object (such as a door) using only packets. I have found that in revision 103, the packet I am interested in is opcode 202, which can be seen in the processAction method. Upon replicating this packet and sending it, nothing happens. However, sending a walk packet (opcode 12 in #103) will work as expected. Can anyone shed light on specifically how to make it interact?</description>
