              <p>Just telling you now, this community isn’t going to spoon feed you anything. You Obviously have not read the rules. If you really do not know how to change the IP of the client to localhost/127.0.0.1 ect. then you haven’t tried hard enough to find a tutorial. There are plenty of tutorial on how to start up your first server, and to make webclients over in the CLIENT TUTORIALS, btw. your also in the wrong help section. Try Client Help next time.</p>
<p>Lastly, saying your going to spam, will just get you bannded from the forum, what are you 5?</p>
