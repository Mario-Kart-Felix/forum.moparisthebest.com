    <title>Question on Media Sharing. [XBox 360]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-on-media-sharing-xbox-360/172882</link>
    <description>OK. 

I used to use WMP [Windows Media Player] to share my PC media, with my 360.
Since I moved, I got a new ISP and new router. It worked for a few days, and then WHAM. it wasn&#39;t working for the 360. But WMP still had it shared?

But old story... [I&#39;d still like help in that subject].

Now I got Nero 8. 

How do I share my 360 with Nero? 
I was in Media Home, I clicked start server, and still, nothing? [Hope I did that right.]

Any help? 

Thanks, Divine.</description>
