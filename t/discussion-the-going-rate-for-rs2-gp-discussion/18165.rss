    <description>[center][size=15pt][b]The going rate of RuneScape 2 millions  [/b] [/center]

I&#39;m making this topic so in a couple of months, we can look at this and go mils for 6$ (or whatever it is now), I can get 10 mil for a dollar. I don&#39;t think this goes in the RuneScape section since this is about the exchange rate for mills, not really about RuneScape, just their money.

I think that its is [b]6[/b]$ per mil, but am not sure.
Later I will make a graph.

<p>You just don’t want to call <span class="bbcode-b">Offtopic!</span> on mopar :P. But that’s ok. Discussion is nice. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I bought a whole bunch of runescape gp once and had some sick drop parties. That was in 2004 I believe, and I got mils for 7$ each.</p>
<p>As for rares, I got a halloween mask on the day they came out, in the forest between Barb village and the dwarf mines. I sold it for 10k and bought full black. My friend told me they were 100k that night. I still think full black looks way more pimp than the halloween mask.</p>

              <p>I brought my first santa had for 100k, over the time period of 5 months they went up 250k(I remember one time trading a dragon battleaxe for one) around this time the most expensive item in the game was the blue phat around 9M. I brought my first mask set for 350k, sold it soon after because it was worthless to me.</p>
<p>When santas where around 200k, blue phat’s around 9.5 I think this was the time clue’s where released to rs. I’m not sure exactly, but I remember ranging blue dragons in gu’tanoth for almost 3 days straght. I made 3M, I brought 2 black cavs, 1 for me and 1 for a friend I’ve knew since I started RS, a set of rune, some dragon weapons and some shit that I didn’t need. I lost my black cav around a week later(I have a screenshot, I remember it well, it was around 6:24am, I was listening to “Guns n Roses - Knocking on Heavens door”, I was reading tip.it while playing rs, I switch backed to rs expecting to find the dead dragon, but what happend was he walked out, and I walked one square forward before ranging it, it fried me. As I switch back, I saw “Loading - Please wait” and pressed prnt screen.)</p>
<p>Anyways, you didn’t need to read all that, but I come to a point, if I had the determination, I could of got a blue phat, and still quit(I did quit for like 2-3 weeks to play A Tale In The Desert, tale 2(now on 3 I belive) but when I returned, I thought WTF, blue masks where 900K, santas where 400k+ depending on the seller, because of summer, merchants and alchers, the price of these items risen dramatically. Blue phat’s where 27M, I was gobsmacked. I could of made 18M just for 9-15 days of ranging blue dragons, but what really stopped me was the fact that it’s useless. From my experiece with santas, masks ect all you can do is wear them. (Now, I started playing rs2 about 7 months after rsc, my friends at school 4 months after, I thought it was crap when I started but I actually liked it, and I belive I’m the only one to reach 90+ combat, so sorry for those hardcore rsc’ers that didn’t ever play rs2), but back in the days I remember being told “nice d battle”, “nice armor”, ect. Never got told “nice santa”, “nice mask”. Now-a-days I’d only say nice phat, because 2 of my friends quit to play WoW and now there both uber rich because they kept there santas.</p>
<p>Anyways, if I had done that 9-15 days work I’d have been around £600-$1100 richer, if I sold the blue phat for mills then sold the mills £4-$8 a peice. But I’m really supprised how much they’ve dropped.</p>

<p>I’m making this topic so in a couple of months, we can look at this and go mils for 6$ (or whatever it is now), I can get 10 mil for a dollar. I don’t think this goes in the RuneScape section since this is about the exchange rate for mills, not really about RuneScape, just their money.</p>
<p>I think that its is <span class="bbcode-b">6</span>$ per mil, but am not sure.<br>
Later I will make a graph.<br>
Please</p>
<ul>
<li>Say the date in your post</li>
<li>Don’t spam<br>
+<span class="bbcode-b">post if you read this.</span>
</li>
