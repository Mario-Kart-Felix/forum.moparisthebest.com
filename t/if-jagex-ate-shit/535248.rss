    <description>Do you think RuneScape would die if JaGeX somehow they fell, or do you think they would sell RuneScape to another game company. If so, what company do you think would buy RuneScape... Or would RuneScape be whoever has the best Private Server..</description>

              <p>TBH idek what to think of that question. If they did decide to close doors nobody is guaranteed their membership back… which would suck ass. And I don’t think any other company would be good with Runescape cause its been with JAgex for so long</p>

They just published it they didn’t make it[/quote]This.  After Jagex bought the game, they had Blitz Games Studios develop it until Blitz went under in September.  Now, Jagex actually develops it in-house.  Before Jagex took over the development Blitz didn’t really care what was happening to the game, but Jagex now is actually giving the players what they want.</p>

<p>Soulsplit probably makes 10,00 a month. Soulsplit is not THAT big of a server 2000 people is not that many tbh.

^ they’re able to terminate your membership whenever they want. if they close, they don’t have to refund or allow people to finish.<br>
[/quote]If you violate their terms ( bot etc) yes they can terminate it with no problems. If they shut down though that’s on them. I would be in the right to do a charge back.<br>
[/quote]their terms do not promise their service will always be available. surely they would allow some type of notice that membership is cancelled and stop allowing people to purchase or renew and allow everyone to run out<br>
[/quote]Their terms don’t have to - you are paying for a month’s service of membership so unless it is stated in the terms that you <span class="bbcode-b">won’t</span> get a month (such as due to bans) then they have to give you a month. If not, they haven’t given you the service/product that you bought and are breaking the law (and that would be a large damages payout given the amount of members)[/quote]</p>

^ they’re able to terminate your membership whenever they want. if they close, they don’t have to refund or allow people to finish.<br>
[/quote]If you violate their terms ( bot etc) yes they can terminate it with no problems. If they shut down though that’s on them. I would be in the right to do a charge back.<br>
[/quote]their terms do not promise their service will always be available. surely they would allow some type of notice that membership is cancelled and stop allowing people to purchase or renew and allow everyone to run out[/quote]Their terms don’t have to - you are paying for a month’s service of membership so unless it is stated in the terms that you <span class="bbcode-b">won’t</span> get a month (such as due to bans) then they have to give you a month. If not, they haven’t given you the service/product that you bought and are breaking the law (and that would be a large damages payout given the amount of members)</p>
