    <title>Dolphins deserve same rights as humans, say scientists</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dolphins-deserve-same-rights-as-humans-say-scientists/433833</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Dolphins should be treated as non-human &quot;persons&quot;, with their rights to life and liberty respected, scientists meeting in Canada have been told. Experts in philosophy, conservation and animal behaviour want support for a Declaration of Rights for Cetaceans. They believe dolphins and whales are sufficiently intelligent to justify the same ethical considerations as humans. Recognising their rights would mean an end to whaling and their captivity, or their use in entertainment. The move was made at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Vancouver, Canada, the world&#39;s biggest science conference. It is based on years of research that has shown dolphins and whales have large, complex brains and a human-like level of self-awareness. This has led the experts to conclude that although non-human, dolphins and whales are &quot;people&quot; in a philosophical sense, which has far-reaching implications.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Source: [url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-17116882]http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-17116882[/url]

At first, this might seem like a plan made up by a bunch of hippies, but when you think about it, it does raise some interesting questions. 

Our society is still based upon the notion that Earth is a planet which is there solely to be used by humans. Everything has to make way for us humans. When we want a road, a building, natural resources, nature has to make way for us. This way of thinking stems from religion, where humans are seen as special creations. We&#39;re not equal to animals, we are their superiors. 

But this very different from the consequences of evolution by natural selection. According to this theory, humans are an advanced, but not special species. We&#39;re just the product of millions of years of evolution, and are not vital for this planet. Looking at the last few centuries, the Earth might be a better place without human presence.

But still, even those who accept the theory of evolution don&#39;t always accept that we&#39;re just animals too. They too see the world as a place to exploit. I&#39;m not an exception. I drive a polluting car, I eat non-organic food. Because of our highly stage of adaption to our environment, we can alter that environment without even thinking about it.

Through the years, people have killed masses of other people just because they saw them as inferior. Today, we see killing of other human beings as an unethical act. Even those who support the death penalty don&#39;t support the killing of entire groups. But we&#39;ve drawn a line. We based that line on that same notion that humans are superior, or special beings. We don&#39;t kill the mentally retarded, not because they are intelligent beings, but because they are human. They are one of us. The exact mentality that caused the Holocaust and Apartheid.

Primates and marine mammals (among others) show signs of intelligence too. They live in groups, they form their own cultures, they use tools, they teach their youth. They are sentient beings. What sets them apart from humans is that they are not capable of altering their environment, because they lack the physical or mental capabilities. In a way, that makes them inferior to humans. But does that mean that they too should become objects that we humans can use? Is a whale equal to an insect, just because a whale doesn&#39;t live in a house? That can&#39;t be it, there are still human cultures that have barely changed their environment. But we accept their presence, and leave them alone. We don&#39;t kill them, we don&#39;t eat them. They are human.

So we accept that humans are animals too, we accept that some other species are intelligent, yet we as a society don&#39;t act upon this knowledge. We draw a line, not based on intelligence, but on species. We&#39;ve reached the emancipation of women, we&#39;ve agreed that all humans, black or white, are equal, so the next step should be the acceptance of rights for other intelligent beings.</description>

<p>Backstory to The Ricky Gervais show?</p>
<p>Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant had a slot on a small radio station like 10 years ago, Karl Pilkington was their producer, they found him weird and funny, gradually got him involved in conversation, viewers like him too cause he had such a different view on everything and it was usually funny because of it. They made a podcast, some audiobooks - now they have them animated for TV.</p>
<p>Since then Karl pilkington has had his own TV show (an idiot abroad, 2 series) and they’re doing new content specifically for the animated version of their podcast.</p>

<p>Im not sure if thats the same video, but on one they marked on the back of a dolphin where it couldn’t see it, and the second they let them go they went up to the mirror and looked at where the- op, there we go, go to 2:25</p>
<p>Baby dolphins act extremely similar to human toddlers in mirrors. They know theyre dolphins, unlike dogs/insects/snakes etc. Which also means they feel alot more pain.</p>
<p>Just because they don’t have math and all that bullshit doesn’t make them not as smart as us (logic wise). They’ve managed to be the next best thing that isn’t starting wars and killing their own.[/quote]</p>
<p>My bird acts the exact same way with a mirror yet he still eats his own crap…</p>

<p>Im not sure if thats the same video, but on one they marked on the back of a dolphin where it couldn’t see it, and the second they let them go they went up to the mirror and looked at where the- op, there we go, go to 2:25</p>
<p>Baby dolphins act extremely similar to human toddlers in mirrors. They know theyre dolphins, unlike dogs/insects/snakes etc. Which also means they feel alot more pain.</p>
<p>Just because they don’t have math and all that bullshit doesn’t make them not as smart as us (logic wise). They’ve managed to be the next best thing that isn’t starting wars and killing their own.</p>

<p>This seems like something started by a ridiculous organization like PETA or something, if you get dolphins to be called ‘people’, then maybe you can get cats and dogs ‘people’ status too, then maybe cows and pigs and deer.  Before you know it you are eating grass and can’t kill a spider in your house without fear of prosecution.  No thanks.</p>

<p>Was wondering the same thing.</p>
<p>I wonder what places like the Vancouver Aquarium/Sea World will have to say about this since they preach a lot about saving and respecting animals, and these are also the same animals that keep them in business. It’s cool to see all the different types of sea creatures, but I always make sure to catch a dolphin show when I go.</p>
