    <title>[req] help me draw a good fist and finger</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-help-me-draw-a-good-fist-and-finger/99057</link>
    <description>well, I am making a game, however I am terrible at graphics(not animation of symbols, but you&#39;ll get what I mean).

this game is where the fist sits there(thumb in there the whole time) and the fingers will go up an down. The fingers, are a little OK, however the fist is just wrong. 
Also I would like a hand and finger parts in the other direction(facing you instead of away) and the fist for towards yo,u should look like an angle of the palm of your hand with the knuckles.(note this isn&#39;t a punching game, it will also be a flash one)</description>
