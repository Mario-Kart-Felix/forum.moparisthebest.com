    <title>[REQ] Simple RSC PowerMiner</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-simple-rsc-powerminer/195892</link>
    <description>Well, basically, I need/would like a basic PowerMiner that works in the Mining Guild of RS1. It doesn&#39;t require anything fancy, just a simple move and click which clicks on the multiple colours assigned to it, such as coal with the colours of 2368548, 855309, and 2368548 for example.

I&#39;m quite sure that there&#39;s no need for any actual testing or anything, so this shouldn&#39;t take long for someone to make. I&#39;d attempt to do so myself, but I&#39;m too damn lazy to actually start learning how to script in SCAR. :P

Thanks in advance to anyone who feels like killing some spare time to help a lazy bastard out...
