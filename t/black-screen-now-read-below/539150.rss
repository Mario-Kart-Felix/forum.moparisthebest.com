    <title>Black screen now, read below</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/black-screen-now-read-below/539150</link>
    <description>Hey guys. So everything I&#39;ve done has been offline. It was working perfectly until I edited shops in shops.cfg. Ever since I compiled the work I&#39;ve done, when I type a user/pass I get blackscreened. My source says..

Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 17

at ItemHandler.loadItemList(Itemhandler.java:283)
at ItemHandler.(init)(ItemHandler.java:173)
at server.main(server.java:112)

Not sure if all of that is normal, but now I can&#39;t login. But before I compiled, it was all working smooth. I tried erasing that shop&#39;s items, recompiling, but same thing. I don&#39;t really have internet access (I&#39;m on my phone). Am I screwed?</description>

              <p>Well I’m not that great of a coder and that’s really all I compiled? I have no idea I think that I’m gonna get rid of it anyways. It kind of sucked but it was the only one of 10 I downloaded that worked without “error connecting to server”  offline even if the cache was via dropbox it still didn’t work. Made sure the runs worked properly too.</p>

              <p>What other files did you change when compiling?</p>
<p>also just for future reference keep a backup of your files for this reason, and/ or leave the notepad windows open so you can simply “Ctrl-Z” the problem and re-compile for the fix.</p>
<p>But the answer is no this is not normal because if it was you wouldn’t have a problem now would you? lol<br>
and the second answer is no you are not screwed. where there is a will there is a way.</p>
