    <title>Change quick reply</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/change-quick-reply/446875</link>
    <description>I think a full editor box instead of the quick reply would be nice when you select quick reply. Or at least a box that had a few smileys or a link to the smileys,  maybe the  bold, italic, underline, strike through, center, left aling, color, sie, and image/code/quote tags would be useful. I  find a lot of times if I want to post a picture  into   the rs section I have to go to a full reply which  just  takes more time. It would be so  much  more efficient if you could click reply, click image button, put in link, click quick reply, bam your done.</description>

<p>Quick reply is used for just that, quick replies. If you need to put more detail into your post, just use the full reply page. And for something like images, it isn’t that hard to type <img alt> ;)[/quote]I am not referring to a complete editor box. More so ofone that just has teh  basic functions, posting an image, url, quote, etc.</p>
