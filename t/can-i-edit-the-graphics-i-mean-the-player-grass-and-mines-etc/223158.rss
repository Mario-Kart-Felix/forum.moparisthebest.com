    <title>Can I Edit the Graphics? I Mean the Player, grass and Mines ETC</title>

    <description>Hey,

I was wondering about it was possible to edit the ground graphics?
Players, trees, stones, mines, ground, rocks, water ?

Because it had been so fun if I could edit it =)

So... I have never seen this before edited,
and I wonder about it is because it&#39;s either Difficult, not possible OR Noone have thought about it before?

Please give me an answer =)

~Thanks for reading!
