    <title>Very wierd problem, help please</title>

    <description>Well we have a weird problem.
When I kill someone, or someone kills me, the server crashes. When I restart, people try to login and it says Your account is already logged in.
So I have to keep restarting the server until people can login.
Some people can&#39;t login anymore, it says error connecting to server, but we&#39;re positive the info is correct.


If you know whats wrong please leave your MSN Yahoo or Skype.
Thanks![br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 06, 2008, 11:28:18 am[/size][hr]FFS.
It auto logged me out since I was afk, now it says error connecting to server, but the server still works because on the cmd I see everyone using yell and commands. No one has disconnected. This is what I&#39;m trying to fix.


I can only log back in if I restart the server a few times, that can be a drag because people tend to leave if they keep dcing.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 06, 2008, 05:09:18 pm[/size][hr]Attempt to bump.</description>
