Middle Earth is a 667 with 728 Cache.

Now you&#39;re probably thinking &#39;Great, Another matrix leach&#39; stuff like that.

Well, Part of it is true... I mean all servers are technically leach&#39;s unless you code from a blank source. But forget about all that stuff.

I have put a lot of work into this server and the outcome is quite nice if I do say so myself.



We have something i have never seen before, NPC Pkers, Basically some NPC&#39;s i found from a cut-scene in RuneScape and made to &#39;act&#39; like humans.
There is one that is fully done, What it does:

It uses vengeance with a 30 second timer.
Talks and yells abuse at the player.
Eats Rocktail.
Has a random probability of saying &#39;gf&#39; and doing a deathmatch or using a teleport tab and ending up at home, Walking to the bank, acting like its banking and eating to full then teleports back to the wilderness.

Now i have not seen that in any other server before, I might be wrong but i don&#39;t think it is in any other server.

We have Soul Wars a lot like RuneScape, I was going to do the &#39;energy&#39; bar thing that kicks you if you don&#39;t get into an activity but people complained about that so I took it out.
It has the Avatar level being lowered by using souls on the obelisk, Avatar deaths to win and instead of having Avatar health percent that was replaced with each teams amount of kills.
It is missing three things to be exactly like RuneScape.

1. You don&#39;t capture graves or obelisk.
2. I took out barricades.
3. You don&#39;t get kicked for inactivity.

We have Glacors also a lot like RuneScape, The only things missing are the minions &#39;specials&#39; and you can attack the Glacor mother while the minions are spawned.

We have the Dominion Tower, Which i take no credit for whatsoever, Dominion Tower was by the Matrix Team.
We have Nex[Matrix Team]
[IMG]http://middleearth728.info/images/qbd.png[/img]
We have Corporeal Beast[Matrix Team]
[IMG]http://middleearth728.info/images/corp.png[/img]
We have Jadinkos, Ganodermic Beasts.
[IMG]http://middleearth728.info/images/jadinkos.png[/img]

We have Castle Wars[Matrix Team]
We have a Custom minigame based off of the Hunger Games movie, It is pretty much the same, Last man standing, Collect Resources and The Most important: Survive.
We have a Custom Money Pouch which works the same as a normal one but more efficient?, You add the money by right clicking and add to pouch like usual, To withdraw it you type ::withdraw amount, Example. ::withdraw 500m Yes with the letters:P There is k m b and all, I&#39;m hoping you all know what they mean.

All skills work except 2, Which are Dungeoneering and Farming, Dungeoneering is being worked on and farming hasn&#39;t been started yet.

I am working on this &#39;Evolution of Combat&#39; Thing for EOC lovers, Now don&#39;t be worried... People have the option to do ::eoc and be &#39;transferred&#39; into the EOC portion of the server, What it does is disallows you to attack people who aren&#39;t in the EOC portion vise versa, People in the EOC portion can use customish abilities.

I recently coded a Custom Player Based Grand Exchange that will be available for everyone soon, It is in testing at the moment... Donators and staff are testing it for 5 days until it is released for everyone.

I recently added living rock caverns somewhat like RuneScape, You kill the living rock things, When they die they turn into a living mineral deposit which you mine for living minerals then you fish rocktail.

The server is up 24/7 on a fast running VPS

There is much more for you to find out if you join!

I hope you consider joining Middle Earth today!
