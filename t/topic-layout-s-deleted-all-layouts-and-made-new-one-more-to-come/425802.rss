    <description>With the permission of Taharok I am posting a Pre-Fomated Layout. This is to help everyone who wishes to make their topic look amazing for viewers to apply. If you wish this, feel free to use this layout!

NOTE:

[quote=&quot;Skyru&quot;]The formatting thread is just a way to help people out while creating a development team thread.[/quote]

---

[size=36pt][b]Layout 1[/b][/size]

[center]Logo[/center]

[u][b]Introduction[/b][/u]

Write an introduction to your topic about your server. Here&#39;s a great intro:
[quote=&quot;Clawz fury&quot;]Well I was supposed to release a clean delta a numerous amount of times but something always got in the way whether it was school or something with the project or whatever.

I think I&#39;m doing this more for me than for the people using this, mainly because I feel I should have done and released something like this so long ago.

By now most of you are probably thinking - &quot;Here we go again, another one of his delta cleaning projects that he won&#39;t finish&quot;. To be honest, I&#39;m pretty confident I&#39;ll finish it (mainly because of the great progress I already made), but I&#39;m not promising anything.[/quote]

[u][b]Why this project started...[/b][/u]
Why did you decide to make you project? To learn new things or to make a RSPS to show your skills. Whatever the reason, show it here. Here&#39;s an example:
[quote=&quot;Mikey Sasse&quot;]Aganoth is a server I&#39;ve been working on since mid July of 2012. My goal for this server is an economy server with a large player base, a great community, and flawless game-play. I am the only server developer, and the server is joint-owned by myself and my partner Drake.[/quote]
You can call this an intro, but I call this an about.

[code=Update Log]
Post your updates here. I suggest making your update log have a layout.
[/code]
Example:
[code=Update Log]
Name(s) - Date - Description
Arham - 10/18/12 - Started project.
etc..
etc..
etc..
[/code]
[b]NOW THIS PART IS OPTIONAL![/b]
[code=Bugs List]
Post your bugs that you or another teammate has/have found.
[/code]
Example:
[code=Bugs List]
Date - Name(s) - How disastrous (Huge, Medium, Easy) - Description - Fixed? - (Optional) Comments
10/20/2012 - Kodiak &amp; Arham - Huge  - Only one player can log in at a time - Fixed
For two people ^^
10/21/2012 - Arham - Easy - Npcs can&#39;t walk - Fixed
For one person^^
etc...
etc..
etc.
[/code]

Put some media here. Pictures first, then videos.

[hr]

Final words

[hr]
[code=Application Format]
This is the Application Format. Try to get as much data as you need from them. But don&#39;t ask for too much.
[/code]
Example:
[code=Application Format]
Msn/Skype:
Proof of Work(links, projects, etc...):
How many hours a day can you work?:
Why should I consider you:
Anything else?:
[/code]

Code: http://pastebin.com/MsXsvtvq

I hope your servers get successful and I don&#39;t want any credits for this layout, I just purely want to help all of you fellow Moparscapians.

[size=36pt]
More Layouts to come! [/size]

Layouts should be used as a lot of threads you see are badly laid out i.e. mines (but not as bad as a lot of the ones I see these days).[/quote]</p>
<p>It used to have 3 layouts. However, I hated them all and deleted them and created this layout.</p>
