    <title>Nether question &amp; my house</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nether-question-my-house/422677</link>
    <description>Hey guys! I just finished my doorbell and waterfall (in winch water flows over restone dust, but due to glass it doesn&#39;t kill it) and im working on my three-high cacti farm right now!

anyways, my house is right next to the station, so you should come and check it out. actually its IN the station.

and why can&#39;t I acces the nether?</description>
