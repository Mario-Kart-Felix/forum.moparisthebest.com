    <title>Ps3 fix</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ps3-fix/423075</link>
    <description>About 4 months ago, my ps3 had the YLOD. About 2 weeks ago, I got it fixed and it was playing fine. However, in the past 2 days, it has decided to shut down on me. I&#39;ll bring up a game and in about 5-10 minutes, the ps3 just shuts down. The red light blinks, then it goes back to normal. It won&#39;t re-enter YLOD, it just shuts down. I have a fan blowing cool air into the system, not making a difference. Any suggestions? I&#39;m open to anything.</description>
