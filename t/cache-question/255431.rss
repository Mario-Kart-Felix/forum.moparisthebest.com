    <description>Ok i have one question since im coding a 525 server im doing it a very weird way by using a copy of my 508 server and changing everything to make it 525 but i have a couple of problems 1 how do i get a 525 cache do i just copy and paste runescape cache to a file in c drive and called it 525cache and make my client get it or d o have to make changes to the cache before it loads properly. A second question on palis 523 and a few 525 servers do u have to have the cache loading and things in the right hand corner or is that optional.

thanks to anyone who answers.
