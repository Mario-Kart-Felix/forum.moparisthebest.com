    <title>Odd issue with the server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/odd-issue-with-the-server/525444</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I am using the server Aggroth and I was wondering how you would change the starting gameframe. When I go to login, it starts at a 474 Gameframe, however it says that it&#39;s 562. And when I change it to the real 562, and log out it goes back to a 474 gameframe. It gets really tedious to keep doing this over and over again. Any help would be much appreciated, thank you :)

Cheers,
