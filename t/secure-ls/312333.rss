    <description>open LS.conf, add this to it

Code:
[code]&lt;entry key=&quot;lspass&quot;&gt;password&lt;/entry&gt;[/code]
Now open world.xml and add this to it

Code:
[code]&lt;entry key=&quot;lspass&quot;&gt;password&lt;/entry&gt;[/code]
Replace password with the password you want

now go to src/org/rscdaemon/server/util/Config.java and find

Code:
[code]LS_PORT = Integer.parseInt(props.getProperty(&quot;lsport&quot;));[/code]
unde r that put

Code:
[code]LS_PASSWORD = props.getProperty(&quot;lspass&quot;);[/code]
now find

Code:
[code]public static String SERVER_IP, SERVER_NAME, RSCD_HOME, CONF_DIR, SERVER_LOCATION, LS_IP;[/code]
replace that with

Code:
[code]public static String SERVER_IP, SERVER_NAME, RSCD_HOME, CONF_DIR, SERVER_LOCATION, LS_IP, LS_PASSWORD;[/code]
k save and close that

now go to /src/org/rscdaemon/server/packetbuilder/loginserver/MiscPacketBuilder.java

find

Code:
[code]s.addShort(Config.SERVER_NUM);[/code]
under that put

Code:
[code]s.addBytes(Config.LS_PASSWORD.getBytes());[/code]
save and close that. Now go to /src/org/rscdaemon/ls/util/Config.java and find

Code:
[code]LS_PORT = Integer.parseInt(props.getProperty(&quot;lsport&quot;));[/code]
and under that put

Code:
[code]LS_PASSWORD = props.getProperty(&quot;lspass&quot;);[/code]
then find

Code:
[code]public static String RSCDLS_HOME, CONF_DIR, LOG_DIR, MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_DB, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASS, LS_IP, QUERY_IP;[/code]
and replace it with

Code:
[code]public static String RSCDLS_HOME, CONF_DIR, LOG_DIR, MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_DB, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASS, LS_IP, QUERY_IP, LS_PASSWORD;[/code]
save and close that. Now go to /src/org/rscdaemon/ls/packethandler/loginserver/RegisterWorld.java and find

Code:
[code]int id = p.readShort();[/code]
then underneath that put

Code:
[code]String passrecv = p.readString().trim();[/code]
then find

Code:
[code]if(server.getWorld(id) == null) {[/code]
replace it with

Code:
[code]if(server.getWorld(id) == null&amp;&amp;passrecv!=null) {[/code]
then underneath that put

Code:
[code]if(!passrecv.equals(Config.LS_PASSWORD)){
System.out.println(&quot;Failed to authenticate world &quot;+id);
return;
}
[/code]
close, save, compile, should be working.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 03, 2009, 02:01:16 pm[/size][hr]Forgot imports for worldloader.

anything else “first time poster”?[/quote]<br>
You’re new here?<br>
Everyone in the community knows me and most dislike me.  I’ve been banned numerous times on these forums, only register to post on occasion.<br>
But it was about a year ago, December 8th, 2008 or before that.<br>
Also, I don’t know who you’re trying to fool, that is infact my, untouched code and post.</p>
