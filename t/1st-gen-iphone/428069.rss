    <title>1st Gen iPhone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/1st-gen-iphone/428069</link>
    <description>Its horrible I know. My Dad gave it to me since he got the new one.


It&#39;s terribly slow, and has horrible re-action time.

So I was wondering if there was a way to speed it up! :). When I play temple run (don&#39;t look at me like that) I have to jump/slide/shift early so I don&#39;t fall/crash.

Thanks :)</description>

What firmware is it on? If it’s 4.0 or above (which I highly doubt, but just incase), turn off spotlight search in the settings for everything. If that fails, then I’d advise just rebooting it every so often.</p>

I thought the gaming didn’t come out till the second gen like ios 2.3.# something like that<br>
You can delete some apps but that’s about it and closing all the apps running in the process, the first gen has an incredibly low cpu and ram[/quote]</p>
