    <title>Weapon delay</title>

    <description>heres what I have

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (2883)) // DarkBow here
{
PkingDelay = 15;
wepdelay = 15;
}[/code]

theres my delay for my ogre comp.  I am trying to make it double hit... but then use a wepdelay of 15.  In my head when I thought of this I figured that something like...

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (2883)) // DarkBow here
{
PkingDelay = 15;
wepdelay = 15;
actionTimer = 1 
PkingDelay = 1;
wepdelay = 1;
}[/code]

That obviously doesnt work.  In fact it just made dark bow hit slower and only once.

If somebody would be kind enough to post how to do this (or preggs would post a hint on how he did it) it would make my day thanks  :)

And no I didnt just get this idea from those other threads it was suggested to me about a week ago by a player.</description>
