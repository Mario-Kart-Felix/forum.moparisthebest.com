You also have to realise that Christianity is based on the New Testament, which is the latter half of the Christian bible, and while the Old Testament (same as the Jewish Torah) still has relevancy in some of the lessons it has to teach us, it is not the only thing Christianity is based on.

The reason for this, as I stated above, is because at the time the books of the Old Testament were written this is the only type of God that the people of the time would understand.<br>

No sin ‘ensures a one-way trip to hell’, you can always ask forgiveness and if you are truly repentant for your sins, God will forgive you for them.</p>

        <p>[quote=“yakman, post:78, topic:331353”]You’re also forgetting that the anal-sex-equals-dirty argument holds absolutely no weight when condoms are as widespread as they are in civilised societies.</p>
<p>My own experience is that throughout my entire life, I have never had sex without a condom or a contraceptive pill, and that was when only I’d been with that girl for more then 6 months.<br>
It is realistic and sensible to expect people to use condoms every single time they have sex.[/quote]</p>
<p>I love to shoot myself in the chest, but it’s okay because I wear bulletproof vest.</p>

We’re not talking about ‘slight’ danger here. As for hanging out with me, I hope it’s not because you wouldn’t be able to have anal sex with me… Otherwise you should love hanging out with me yo</p>

        <p>MujaheD, you want things which are fun and risky?<br>
How about racing fast cars, playing football, playing rugby, swimming, diving, having heterosexual sex, archery, weightlifting, using the internet (risk of computer virus!), drinking alcohol, travelling and countless other things. In fact, you could argue that everything in life has some risk attached to it.</p>

<p>The idea that growing up as the child of gay parents is inevitably bad for you has been largely discredited. A 2005 <a href="http://journals.lww.com/jrnldbp/Abstract/2005/06000/Lesbian_Mothers,_Gay_Fathers,_and_Their_Children_.12.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">review</a> of the research on lesbian mothers and gay fathers found there were no significant developmental differences between their children and those from heterosexual families.</p>
<p>What matters is how you parent, not who you sleep with. If there is a loving family that wants to rescue a child from the horrors of social services, it would be immoral, stupid and disgusting to prevent that.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t think anyone argues that the child wouldn’t grow up just as healthy, physically, as a child with a heterosexual couple as parents.  What I would be concerned about is how they would grow up mentally and spiritually, and unfortunately no university can conduct studies on that. [/quote]</p>
<p>Throughout this people have wondered aloud why anybody would bring up a child in the environment of gay parents. They want to ‘protect’ children from accepting same sex relationships in society.</p>
<p>Nobody mentioned the distinction between physical, mental and spiritual development until after I posted that study. This dishonest moving of the goalposts is typical.</p>
<p>Furthermore the paper I quoted doesn’t focus on physical development at all. Instead it talks about behavioural and mental.</p>

 Lesbian Mothers:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Findings from research suggest that children with lesbian or gay parents are comparable with children with heterosexual parents on key psychosocial developmental outcomes. In many ways, children of lesbian or gay parents have similar experiences of family life compared with children in heterosexual families.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As for spiritual development. Yes it is very likely that the children won’t be brought up in a religion that persecutes their parents. In the same way that black parents won’t bring up their children to be KKK members and Jews won’t bring up their children to be Nazis. You could even question if missing out on spiritual and religious development is such a bad thing. I would.</p>

<p>I think it’s wrong to say the Catholic Church ‘persecutes’ gay people.  Having gay sex is a sin in the Catholic religion, but it doesn’t go any further than that, there is certainly no ‘persecution’.  But the point is that Catholic orphanages should have the right to choose suitable adoptive parents for the children under their supervision according to the beliefs of the Catholic church.  Just like they wouldn’t adopt a kid off to a married man and woman who were swingers, satanists, or drug addicts.  And it’s ridiculous for a government to try and deny them that right.[/quote]</p>
<p>On this point we were talking about the specific detail of whether having gay parents is bad for a child or not. I don’t appreciate you dragging the point towards the question of whether the church persecutes gays or not, that is a separate question entirely.</p>
<p>Since you haven’t really rebutted the points, does this mean you accept that children are not harmed because they have gay parents?</p>

<p>The Catholic church has a long history of bigotry and being anti-science. On condoms they go against every medical authority in the world. On stem cell research they have lobbied hard to stop Alzheimer’s patients being cured. They opposed the use of painkillers for women in labour because it the pain was a punishment given to Eve. They brutally silenced Galileo when he dared to suggest that the Earth revolved around the Sun.</p>
<p>The rest of society uses the knowledge gained by science to help make better and more moral decisions, but the Catholic church and similar religions think they know better. They get their knowledge not from reason but from faith, taking instruction from voices nobody else can hear.</p>

</aside>
<p>Now you are just spouting propaganda.</p>
<ol>
<li>They do not go against anyone when it comes to condoms.  They simply advocate abstinence instead of having sex with everyone you see but using a condom.  Nothing wrong with that.</li>
<li>The Catholic Church is NOT against stem cell research.  They are against killing living human beings through abortion and growing test tube babies just to kill them to harvest these stem cells.  There are humane ways to get stem cells for research, such as getting them from umbilical cords, which the Catholic Church supports.</li>
<li>That they would be against pain killers doesn’t even make sense.  I’m positive that this was completely made up.</li>
<li>As with any organization made up of fallible people, the church has made mistakes in the past.  They acknowledged that this was a mistake and issued a public apology for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Catholic church supports science and innovation and adapts to them as more is discovered and new things are invented.  Only when things are in direct contradiction of our faith, the bible, or tradition are they denounced, some quick examples I can think of are abortion and euthanasia.</p>

<li>
<p>They do so. They go against all major medical and scientific bodies. One example I’ll bring up is the World Health Organisation (WHO) an agency of the UN. Examples of their successes are organising the international effort to wipe out smallpox and leading a campaign to immunise children in developing nations against six diseases of childhood - diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, measles and TB. They know what they’re talking about, they’re run by doctors, researchers, immunologists, epidemiology and other experts. And they are against the church’s position.<br>

<p>Yes, you’re absolutely right. I forgot to include the word ‘embryonic’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It makes sense if you think about it from a Catholic point of view. God’s punishment to Eve for eating the fruit was to have terrible suffering in childbirth. If somebody gives painkillers they are interfering with God’s plan and it is righteous to ‘correct’ them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The painkiller thing was eventually renounced by the church in the mid-19th century. Another example of when they changed their mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Church saw its attack on peasant healers as an attack on <span class="bbcode-i">magic</span>, not medicine. The devil was believed to have real power on earth, and the use of that power by peasant women - whether for good or evil - was frightening to the Church and State. The greater their satanic powers to help themselves, the less they were dependant on God and the Church and the more they were potentially able to use their powers against God’s order. Magic charms were thought to be at least as effective as prayer in healing the sick, but prayer was Church-sanctioned and controlled while incantations and charms were not. Thus magic cures, even when successful, were an accursed interference with the will of God, achieved with the help of the devil, and the cure itself was evil. There is no problem in distinguishing God’s cure from the devil’s, for obviously the Lord would work through priests and doctors rather thenn through peasant women. The wise woman, or witch, had a host of remedies which had been tested for years in use. Many of the herbal remedies developed by witches still have their place in modern pharmacology. They had pain-killers, digestive aids and anti-inflammatory agents. <span class="bbcode-b">They used ergot for the pain of labor at the time when the Church held that pain in labor was the Lord’s just punishment for Eve’s original sin.</span> Ergot derivatives are the principal drug used today to hasten labor and aid in the recovery from childbirth.</p>

<p>This passage in Genesis 3, and a few others similarly deficient and inconsistent in their translations, have supported a faulty Catholic “theology”, to the effect that sexual intercourse in marriage is a necessary evil, and should be only for the purpose of procreation, and that intense suffering in the act of child-bearing is the just and reasonable punishment for sinful woman. At one time it was even taught that a woman’s cries and screams in childbirth pleased the ears of God, and two women were once burned to death by the Church in France – one for accepting a pain-killer during childbirth, and the other for administering it (ES Cowles, Religion and Medicine in the Church, p 18). On the other hand, it has never been considered necessary that man refrain from using labor-saving devices to alleviate the “sorrow” of Adam’s “special curse” in agriculture!</p>

<p>It certainly happened, I didn’t make it up I promise.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You’re contradicting yourself there. First you say the church should not change it morals for some popular fad and that they should NEVER sacrifice core values for popularity as so many religions are doing these days. Then you admit it was wrong to silence Galileo like that. Remember that in Galileo’s time, one of the church’s values was that the Sun went around the Earth. The church believed it was right and good and that it was a morally justifiable thing to do that to him. The heliocentric model was probably viewed as a popular fad too, you can never tell at the time if new ideas are popular fads or valuable new knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>They’ve changed their moral position now, only after it became obvious the Earth really goes round the Sun and only after the philosophers of the Enlightenment invented the principle of free expression.</p>
<p>The reason I brought all this up is to show that the Catholic Church has been wrong before in important things it once regarded as core values and there is no reason to think it’s not wrong on this.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Again, the catholic church goes against no one when it comes to condoms.  It believes that sex should only occur in a marriage between a man and a women, and that, since marriages should be open to children, there should be no <span class="bbcode-b">artificial</span> forms of contraception between the man and the woman.  They do, however, support natural and more effective methods of birth control such as <a href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/women/contraceptive/126.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Natural Family Planning</a>.  So explain again how they go against any medical authority when it comes to condoms?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those quotes show that the Catholic Church was against witchcraft, and at the time many medicinal practices were considered witchcraft, so of course they would have been against them.  No true catholic today is going to say that pain killers are evil though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I might be using the wrong words here, I’m not a church historian or anything.  Core morals are different than beliefs.  Believing that the sun revolves around the earth or vice-versa is not a moral belief that can’t change or, really, anything that matters.  Other things are moral beliefs, shouldn’t be changed, and do matter.  Examples of these are the belief that murder is wrong, sex should only occur in marriage between a man and a woman, stealing is wrong, lying is wrong etc etc.  There is a big difference and therefore just because the Church has changed it’s belief on things that don’t matter, like what spatial body revolves around what, doesn’t mean it can or should change it’s stance on certain moral issues.[/quote]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do believe I have already explained how they go against the World Health Organisation (WHO) and I posted links to their website.<br>
I’ll show you quotes from the website you seem unable to read.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Condoms for HIV prevention
<p>…Condoms, when used correctly and consistently, are highly effective in preventing HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)… Condoms are a key component of comprehensive HIV prevention…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>compare this to</p>
<blockquote>"The Aids virus is roughly 450 times smaller than the spermatozoon. The spermatozoon can easily pass through the 'net' that is formed by the condom,"</blockquote>
<blockquote>  The statements are totally incorrect. Latex condoms are impermeable. They do prevent HIV transmission.</blockquote>
<p>Well perhaps the rest of the church disagrees with Cardinal Trujill’s statements? If they do, they haven’t shown it.<br>
In fact a few years later the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5923927.ece" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Pope says condoms are not the solution to Aids - they make it worse</a></p>

<p>I’d like to see how you attempt to spin this to make the church look good…</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>I will quote the relevant passages from those texts because you clearly haven’t read them.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>...the Church held that pain in labor was the Lord's just punishment for Eve's original sin..</blockquote>
<blockquote>..At one time it was even taught that a woman's cries and screams in childbirth pleased the ears of God, and two women were once burned..</blockquote>
<p>OF course no Catholic today will agree with them and that’s exactly my point! The church’s moral teaching has changed since the 19th century, they no longer belief it is morally good to burn women for using painkillers. There is no reason to think it was the last time.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Yes, and another example of a core moral was to silence those who disagree with you. That was used to silence Galileo.<br>
Centuries later, the principles of free expression and free thought were invented/discovered and the church adapted its beliefs, it is no longer acceptable to silence people like they did to Galileo. We have no reason to believe the church’s stance might not change again.</li>
