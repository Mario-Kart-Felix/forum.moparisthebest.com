<p><span class="bbcode-i">By Simon Caldwell<br>
Last updated at 5:30 PM on 28th February 2010</span></p>
<p>Children in care will suffer if the last Roman Catholic adoption agency in England and Wales is forced to close down by gay equality laws, Church leaders warned today.</p>
<p>Three Catholic bishops told worshippers that they were taking the case of the Catholic Care adoption agency to the High Court on Wednesday because they were fighting for the rights of vulnerable children to a loving family.</p>
<p>They said that the closure of the adoption agency, which finds new homes for about 20 ‘difficult-to-place’ children each year, would represent the loss of an ‘effective and well-respected resource’.</p>
<p>The agency, which serves the dioceses of Leeds, Middlesbrough and Hallam in South Yorkshire, is the only one of 11 Catholic adoption agencies in the country to continue to fight the Sexual Orientation Regulations (SORs).</p>
<p>The law outlawed discrimination against gay couples in the provision of goods and services and was pushed through Parliament in 2007 in spite of protests from leaders of all the mainstream religious faiths.</p>
<p>It meant that Catholics adoption agencies - which together found new homes for about 250 children in care each year - were obliged to assess same-sex couples as potential adopters or foster parents.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church teaches that gay adoption is ‘gravely immoral’, however, and it has since either closed its adoption agencies or relinquished control of them, without a single agency surviving.</p>
<p>But today Bishop Arthur Roche of Leeds, Bishop John Rawsthorne of Hallam and Bishop Terry Drainey of Middlesbrough vowed to fight to keep Catholic Care open in its present form.</p>
<p>In a letter read out at Masses in hundreds of churches they said the Government was trying to force Catholic Care to operate ‘with disregard to the Church’s teaching on marriage and family life’ even though the agency had a record of placing ‘some of the most vulnerable children to the care of loving families in our region’.</p>
<p>‘Despite the fact that Catholic Care has been able to find caring families for a vast number of needy children we are being invited either to stop our adoption work or stop being a Catholic charity altogether,’ the bishops said.</p>
<p>‘Our position is that it is in the interests of children to continue our work. We are not judging other agencies that accept same sex couples for adoption, but feel strongly that we should not be forced to do so, nor is there a necessity for this to happen.</p>
<p>'We believe that this is a legally justifiable position.’</p>
<p>They said: ‘Our adoption service has been at the heart of the local community for over 100 years.</p>
<p>‘It has been praised and widely appreciated by local authorities and social services, as well as the children who have benefited from this work and the couples who have sought to adopt them.</p>
<p>‘Children have a right to a family life,’ they added. ‘There are too many children awaiting adoption and Catholic Care has a vital and a special role in helping very vulnerable children by finding loving families for them.</p>
<p>‘If Catholic Care is forced to close its adoption service it is children who will lose an effective and well-respected resource in the Yorkshire region.’</p>
<p>The High Court battles comes less than a year after the Charity Tribunal told Catholic Care that it could not continue as an adoption agency unless it accepted gay couples.</p>
<p>The agency had earlier applied to the Charity Commission to change its charitable objects so that it could appeal for an exemption under Regulation 18 of the SORs.</p>
<p>The regulation allows charities to practice limited discrimination in pursuing their objectives effectively.</p>
<p>But the Charity Tribunal ruled that it would be unlawful to allow Regulation 18 to be used as a defence by Catholic Care, saying that the proposed alteration of the objects ‘arose substantially out a desire to maintain a principled stance rather than being specifically designed to advance the … charitable purpose of the support, relief and care of children and young people without families to care for them’.</p>
<p>The appeal to the High Court will be heard on the same day that the Catholic bishops of England and Wales publishe a pre-General Election document in which they say it is ‘essential’ for politicians to support marriage and the family.</p>
<p>While the main political parties disagree on the importance of heterosexual marriage, with Labour arguing that it was simply a lifestyle choice, they share support for civil partnerships and gay adoption.</p>
<p>Last month Tory frontbencher Nick Herbert, who is openly gay, said homosexuality may be ‘given by God’ and hinted that the Church was wrong to oppose gay marriage and gay adoption.</p>
<p>‘We should not seek to prevent adoption by same-sex couples who may offer a love and stability that is absent from too many homes,’ he told an audience in Washington DC.</p>
<p>He spoke shortly after Pope Benedict XVI told the English and Welsh bishops that the effects of the Government’s equality laws represented a ‘violation of the natural law’ and that they imposed ‘unjust limitations on the freedom of religious communities to act in accordance with their beliefs’.</p>

<p>I would just like to say that I’m damn sure Catholics are a much greater danger to a child than a gay person is, and also that I want them to go explain to the face of every single child stuck in foster and orphanage care exactly why it is they can’t go home with a family that wants to love and take care of them today. And I want them to do that <span class="bbcode-i">on camera</span>. I want to hear the words coming out of their mouths while they look at those children without families and lie and lie and lie because they are full of hate and they worship death, and I want it on the fucking record so no one will ever forget what Jesus stands for.</p>

<p>Ah yes, so good of them. Good for those who stuck to their guns when the progressives were abolishing slavery. Good for those who stood up to the reformers who gave women the vote. Good for them who defended the Kings and Queens against those trying to install democracy.</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. and Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>Thank you for your application to apply for adoption. Though you’re a loving and caring couple and these children have been stuck here for 3 years now after their mother decided not to have an abortion, we’ve decided you’re not suitable because neither of you possess testicles. Although the welfare of children is important to us, its not as important as our religion and the bible, that ideology trumps all.</p>
<p>God bless you.</p>
<p>Rev. McGrath</p>

<p>I agree with MITB.</p>
<p>As for the Catholic bashing going on here, I would like to say I have been taking weekly classes since August to become Catholic and I can’t wait to be welcomed into the Church on Easter. Maybe if you would take some time to study scripture and really look at the Catholic faith in depth, you would change how you view Catholics.</p>

<p>As for the Catholic bashing going on here, I would like to say I have been taking weekly classes since August to become Catholic and I can’t wait to be welcomed into the Church on Easter. Maybe if you would take some time to study scripture and really look at the Catholic faith in depth, you would change how you view Catholics.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Every time my curiosity of religion resurfaces and I study the faith of Christianity, I die a little inside. I constantly attack the views of others so they defend themselves and thus make me question my own beliefs. I’m always open to new ideas, but the more I find out about Christianity, the more concerned I am about humanity.</p>
<p>Every Christian except 1 that I’ve come across in real life (including preachers I’ve met) is clueless about the subject anyway. They just take some of the bible’s morals, reject others, tell themselves god will make everything all better if they screw up and generally do whatever the fuck they want.</p>
<p>I agree with george carlin: Humanity has been going downhill ever since the traders and the church took over.</p>

<p>Good for them.  Great to see not all religions change their morals to suit what is the popular fad, some stick by their beliefs even under persecution.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why shouldn’t religions change? If I were high up in a church, I’d love to see change in my religion. Society changes, which means that more and more people walk away from old forms of religions, like the Catholic church. I’d rather see every religion cease to exist, but I know that won’t happen in my lifetime. But if religions could tolerate more groups, the world would be a better place.</p>

        <blockquote>On her radio show, Dr Laura Schlesinger said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22, and cannot be condoned under any circumstance. The following response is an open letter to Dr. Laura, penned by a US resident, which was posted on the Internet. It's funny, as well as informative:
<p>Dear Dr. Laura:</p>
<p>Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God’s Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination… End of debate.</p>
<p>I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of God’s Laws and how to follow them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can’t I own Canadians?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15: 19-24. The problem is how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is, my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination-Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don’t agree. Can you settle this? Are there ‘degrees’ of abomination?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle- room here?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev.19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? Lev.24:10-16. Couldn’t we just burn them to death at a private family affair, like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help.</p>
<p>Thank you again for reminding us that God’s word is eternal and unchanging.</p>
<p>Your adoring fan.</p>

this may be about the jewish faith, however catholics have the same bollocks, studying the religion to join it seems a bit off to me, you dont join a religion because you’re intelligent, you join because you follow their ideals, if they dont accept anyone into it without going through a rigourous studying course its not much of a religion, you’re looking for the word cult. I dont agree with MiTB at all, living by the bible is all well and good but forcing it upon others is not. I dont see an issue with homosexual couples, they’re perfectly within their rights to be together if they wish, getting married however stems from religious meaning so i can understand the opposition to same sex marriages.

Good for them.  Great to see not all religions change their morals to suit what is the popular fad, some stick by their beliefs even under persecution.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why shouldn’t religions change? If I were high up in a church, I’d love to see change in my religion. Society changes, which means that more and more people walk away from old forms of religions, like the Catholic church. I’d rather see every religion cease to exist, but I know that won’t happen in my lifetime. But if religions could tolerate more groups, the world would be a better place.</p>

<p>I’ve read the bible, and it did change my view on Christianity. Before I did, I wasn’t religious. Nothing more, nothing less. But the god that is portrayed in the bible is a hateful asshole, and you should be ashamed that you worship him.[/quote]</p>
<p>I didn’t say religions shouldn’t change, they should and do, but they should NEVER sacrifice core values for popularity as so many religions are doing these days.</p>
<p>People who believe they are attracted to the same sex that don’t practice homosexuality (ie, don’t actually participate in homosexual acts), are perfectly fine.  Attractions are not immoral, but some actions are.  This I believe is the official stance of the catholic church (directly derived from the bible).</p>
<p>Of course it’s wrong, everyone says it’s wrong including the catholic church.  There are sickos everywhere that need punished, it isn’t just in the catholic church.</p>
<p>I don’t know what part of the bible you read, but the God I worship is an all-loving, merciful God that loves us all more than anything and only wants the best for us.</p>

        <blockquote>33% of homosexuals report having anal sex with multiple partners.
63% of AIDS patients are homosexual.
<p>Fecal matter consists of undigested material mixed with a slurry of smelly bacteria and digestive chemicals.</p>
<p>These bacteria include cocci, bacilli, and coliforms. Of these, coliform most often causes illness in humans.</p>
<p>When homosexuals are engaging in anal sex, small tears can form both inside the anus and along the shaft of the penis, which allows for entrance of coliforms into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>This is a plate demonstrating what coliforms do to mammal blood.<br>
<img src="http://www.water-research.net/images/ICE-TEA2.GIF" alt width="300" height="282"></p>
<p>You can easily imagine what those do once they get inside your bloodstream. But this is only the start of the homosexual’s worry.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the majority of AIDS patients are homosexual. This is because the same anal tears can easily transmit the disease from man to man.</p>
<p>Because such a large percentage of gays have AIDS, and an even larger percent are promiscuous, their existence is a public health crisis.</p>
<p>Not only does all this demonstrate that homosexuality is dirty and unhealthy, but it is a self-defeating behavior that be fairly compared with suicide. Hence, it is in societies’ best interest to limit homosexual behavior in every way possible, for the public’s safety.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot return to the ahead-of-their-time anti-sodomy laws, as the left side of the country would cry foul. We can however, at least reduce the popularity of homosexuality and anal sex by banning gay marriage in every state.</p>

<p>I studied Catholicism pretty in-depth as well as various other religions (Religious Education, you don’t have it in the States I believe, but if done properly it’s actually not like you’d imagine). It only really served to strengthen my believe that Christianity (well, religion in general, really) is one of the biggest dangers in the world today.</p>
<p>I have nothing against people who want to believe (they’re the victims, more than anything) but I’d be much happier putting my kids, did I have any, in the care of a gay couple (or practically anyone) than a devout Christian. Sorry. The things you guys will do in the name of a fictional character from a book, the ethics you will shove aside because those who came before you did, it seems to have no bounds.</p>
<p>Obviously I’m applying a blanket statement here, you and Mopar are quite clearly normal people and not some kind of evil cult memberships. But essentially you’re guilty by association.</p>

<p>I do not understand how some of you can so easily dismiss the fact that Jesus did exist. There’s proof!</p>
<p>How can you go outside at night, look up at the stars, and not believe there was a higher power working there??</p>
<p>And as to Jesus existing, there is actual physical proof recorded in government records of the time, Roman and Jewish at least. All I can say is that before meeting MITB and learning of his faith, I was not religious at all. My family has had a lot of tragedies over the last 20 years, and I didn’t know what we did to deserve everything. But after going to Mass, and speaking with our Deacon I decided I had it all wrong.</p>
<p>As to the thread topic, being gay is wrong and it says this in the Bible. Thinking about it is not the sin, but acting on the feelings is. So why raise a child in that environment? I have a few family members that are gay, including a half sister, and I have already discussed with MITB that when we have children and if she is still acting on those feelings, our child will not be allowed to stay at her home.</p>
