<blockquote>
<p>The bible doesn’t teach people to discriminate against other human beings, or to judge them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So, don’t discriminate or judge humans, just gay people.  Am I understanding this right? (You will probably bring up your bullshit argument about people being gay as acceptable, but not their practice of it.  You attempting to deny them the right of practicing sexuality is still discrimination, and it is discrimination founded on the judgement of it being wrong).</p>
<p>[quote=“Fat Cookies, post:31, topic:331353”]It is ironic how many people on this forum are against this homophobia but calls people they don’t like “fags” or “faggots” all the time.</p>
<p>Gay/lesbian couples shouldn’t be able to adopt straight away, simply because it will fuck up the child’s mind. I think they should past some sort of test that proves that they will look after the child like he/she would be in a normal family and not force/encourage the child to become homosexual themselves.[/quote]</p>
<p>Calling someone (on IRC specifically, which is no doubt why you said that) a faggot does not mean you are calling them homosexual or that you resent that they would be, it is a figure of speech and an almost entirely detached insult.<br>
What the fuck? Pass a test to adopt a child if you’re gay? I think you should have to pass a test in order to allow you to continue spewing your retarded mind.</p>
<p>[quote=“srt8, post:20, topic:331353”]How can you go outside at night, look up at the stars, and not believe there was a higher power working there??</p>
<p>As to the thread topic, being gay is wrong and it says this in the Bible.[/quote]</p>
<p>How can you be so arrogant as to assert that the only real truth of the existence of the universe is due solely to a higher power?  How can you be so ignorant to assume that because of your faith you ‘morals’ are sensible?  How can you be so ignorant to assume that a preferred sexuality is wrong because it is stated in your ‘holy’ book?  How can you be so thoughtless as to not independently (as in, without using the Bible as proof) follow the process of determining whether or not it actually <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> wrong?</p>

<p>Thats stupid to deny your child the right to see a family member due to them being a homosexual, that is absolutely wrong and discriminatory. And Jesus wouldve been a popular name at the time there were probably quite a few running around, in fact thats probably why the name was chosen at the time people could whisper and rumour about an amazing person called jesus but because there were so many jesus’ around no one would actually know who it was but it would keep hope up and so on. Then someone decided to write it down and hey presto your hope giving rumours have just become a religion. What people believe in is up to them, personally i find karma a damn good system, but raising your child in your ways is wrong, i know a few girls that have been brought up by devout christian families and their lives are utter torture they cannot do anything they want to, you should let the child choose. Also taking everything the bible says as fact is going to fuck you up, its one of the most contradictory books in all of history so take it with a pinch of salt <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I do not judge these family members, and love them very much. But, I do not want my child’s young mind to be confused by their actions.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I sincerely hope that one day your child becomes distinctly aware of your actions and motives and becomes confused by them, so that he/she can ponder whether or not your actions actually have substance to them.  By trying to protect your child from what the Bible deems wrong, you are likely causing more confusion than would ever be caused by observing same sex couple.  It is inevitable, your child <span class="bbcode-b">will</span> be exposed to alternative sexuality, and they <span class="bbcode-b">will</span> question it.  What will you tell them?  What will be your explanation as to why this is so bad?  I hope for your sake you have convinced them how awesomely divine the Bible is by that point, so your response of ‘it is the word of God, as seen in the Bible’ is accepted.</p>
<p>The quotes in Cain’s post are powerful and thought provoking.  Carl Sagan was an extremely wise man, and a very careful and intelligent thinker and speaker.  I do encourage you to draw your own conclusions, but falling back to ‘the Bible is right’ is a poor one.</p>
<p>Our species has come to the point where we have the capability to exist as a single graceful, thoughtful, and wise ‘organism’.  Why do we destroy ourselves?  Why do we fight?  Why do we feel so important?  How can we seriously accept our own beliefs to be true?  Are we so wise and knowing to state the supposed origins of the universe and life and science?  Are we so bold as to think that we know <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> at all?</p>
<p>When, why, how, did you (or I should say, the person who came up with it for you) come across this frivolous belief of God and life and belonging in the universe, and that it is correct?</p>
<p>One can only hope that society will not inevitably crumble under the power of humanity’s desire to answer itself…</p>

        <p>Just playing the devil’s advocate here to add to the discussion:<br>
Do the people here who don’t support homosexuality believe it is better for a closeted homosexual to take part in a lavender relationship, despite having no real feelings for their partner in such a relationship?<br>
It has been stated that having homosexual thoughts isn’t the sin, and that acting on them is… I think this is a good followup question.</p>

        <p>The idea that growing up as the child of gay parents is inevitably bad for you has been largely discredited. A 2005 <a href="http://journals.lww.com/jrnldbp/Abstract/2005/06000/Lesbian_Mothers,_Gay_Fathers,_and_Their_Children_.12.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">review</a> of the research on lesbian mothers and gay fathers found there were no significant developmental differences between their children and those from heterosexual families.</p>
<p>What matters is how you parent, not who you sleep with. If there is a loving family that wants to rescue a child from the horrors of social services, it would be immoral, stupid and disgusting to prevent that.</p>
<p>The Catholic church has a long history of bigotry and being anti-science. On condoms they go against every medical authority in the world. On stem cell research they have lobbied hard to stop Alzheimer’s patients being cured. They opposed the use of painkillers for women in labour because it the pain was a punishment given to Eve. They brutally silenced Galileo when he dared to suggest that the Earth revolved around the Sun.</p>
<p>The rest of society uses the knowledge gained by science to help make better and more moral decisions, but the Catholic church and similar religions think they know better. They get their knowledge not from reason but from faith, taking instruction from voices nobody else can hear.</p>

<p>You’re pointing out all these disgusting and dirty things that happen with unprotected anal sex, but you fail to appreciate that this isn’t grounds for banning something. There are plenty of dirty things that people do which aren’t banned. Things are only banned if they cause harm to others and homosexuality doesn’t. Even if it did lead to AIDS, only the single gay man would be harmed and not society as a whole, therefore there is no grounds for laws to be passed banning it.</p>
<p>Your statistics appear to be contradicted, it seems only 5-10% of HIV/AIDS transmittions are from sex between men, but a whopping 67% are between a male and female. Furthermore, lesbian sex is responsible for even less transmittions, so with your logic we should ban all marriage except one between two women.<br>

<p>The emotionally-charged argument with the blood-in-the-Petri-dish is pretty stupid. It would only convince those who have no idea about anything involving Petri dishes. In proper science you have to have a standard to compare against. This means you have two dishes, one with ‘coliforms’ blood and one with just healthy blood. I’m pretty sure that all blood looks like that when you’ve left it standing in a dish for any length of time. Microbes from the air land on the blood and easily form moulds and clots.</p>

Nobody ever said being gay makes people perfect parents no matter what they do. If a gay couple taught their kids to be racist or to torture animals I would have the same opinion of them as I would for a straight couple. Their sexual orientation has nothing to do with it.

Are you comparing being around homosexuals with being hit by a train?

Obviously the Catholic church doesn't think being raised in a homosexual household is best for these children, and they have a right to think that, which this law is infringing upon.</blockquote>

<p>@c|p, who said anyone is against homosexuality just because it is in the bible. (or any other book?)  It’s obviously not natural (look at the ‘equipment’), it doesn’t serve a purpose (no reproduction), and homosexuals are far more promiscuous than heterosexuals (which isn’t as healthy, mentally or physically).</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:46, topic:331353”]Just playing the devil’s advocate here to add to the discussion:<br>
Do the people here who don’t support homosexuality believe it is better for a closeted homosexual to take part in a lavender relationship, despite having no real feelings for their partner in such a relationship?<br>
It has been stated that having homosexual thoughts isn’t the sin, and that acting on them is… I think this is a good followup question.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not sure what lavender means in this post, here it means a flower or a color.  I’m going to assume it means ‘straight’ or ‘heterosexual’ in this post.  I don’t really know how to answer this question.  Thoughts are never a sin unless you act on them, regardless.  So if you thought you were attracted to the same sex, I guess it would be your choice whether you want to try to have a heterosexual relationship or not.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:47, topic:331353”]The idea that growing up as the child of gay parents is inevitably bad for you has been largely discredited.

<p>I don’t think anyone argues that the child wouldn’t grow up just as healthy, physically, as a child with a heterosexual couple as parents.  What I would be concerned about is how they would grow up mentally and spiritually, and unfortunately no university can conduct studies on that.</p>

<li>The Catholic Church is NOT against stem cell research.  They are against killing living human beings through abortion and growing test tube babies just to kill them to harvest these stem cells.  There are humane ways to get stem cells for research, such as getting them from umbilical cords, which the Catholic Church supports.</li>
<li>That they would be against pain killers doesn’t even make sense.  I’m positive that this was completely made up.</li>
<li>As with any organization made up of fallible people, the church has made mistakes in the past.  They acknowledged that this was a mistake and issued a public apology for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Catholic church supports science and innovation and adapts to them as more is discovered and new things are invented.  Only when things are in direct contradiction of our faith, the bible, or tradition are they denounced, some quick examples I can think of are abortion and euthanasia.</p>

A lavender marriage is a male-female marriage in which one or both of the partners is homosexual or bisexual. The more general term is mixed-orientation marriage. It is a specialized instance of a marriage of convenience, in which the marriage is formed for some reason other than the romantic attachment assumed to be the basis of modern marriages, for legal reasons involving inheritance or immigration, for example.
 The partners in a lavender marriage were concealing the fact that the sexual ori...</p>

<p>With regards to yakman’s remark about being against pain killers for women giving birth, I took a look around. I did find one forum discussion that I took the time to read and, judging by the replies, they were all extremely conservative and god fearing men. They believed that pain killers shouldn’t be used because it undermines the fact that the pain is meant to be part of a woman’s punishment for the original sin.<br>
It’s unreasonable to suggest that all catholics, or even a large number of them, hold this hard line view.</p>

        <blockquote>It's obviously not natural (look at the 'equipment')</blockquote>
<p>Actually it is natural. Homosexual behavior is not solely unique to humans, it has been well documented in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">animals</a>. Also, homosexuality has been around far longer than your religion and it will be around for a long time to come. Basically what I’m trying to say is that: how can behavior that is prevalent throughout the whole animal kingdom and human history be seen as unnatural? There is not a single country on the earth that can admit to being 100% pure heterosexuals.</p>
<blockquote>and homosexuals are far more promiscuous than heterosexuals (which isn't as healthy, mentally or physically).</blockquote>
<p>really? How would anyone know this?</p>

I’d rather have my children try things and find their own preferences rather than being indoctrinated into believing certain things are right, and all of the other options are not.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>So you aren’t going to tell your children not to steal, kill, or have sex with 50 year old men?  They are your children, but don’t be surprised if someone doesn’t come in and take them away from you.[/quote]<br>
I’d rather have them find out that stealing is bad themselves. the latter two things I would try to prevent of course.<br>
But still, I would want to expose them to as many things as possible for their own <span class="bbcode-b">development</span>. I think indoctrinating your child with things like “gays are bad” and “don’t smoke weed because it’s really bad for you” is bad for his or her development. I also think it will kind of help with raising them. I’m pretty sure my father doesn’t want me to smoke weed, so I keep it a secret from him. If he was cool with it I would’ve told him already.</p>
