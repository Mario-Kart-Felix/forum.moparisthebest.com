    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=14pt][b]Gay equality laws threatening last Roman Catholic adoption agency ‘will lead to harm to children in care’[/b][/size]

[i]By Simon Caldwell
Last updated at 5:30 PM on 28th February 2010[/i]

Children in care will suffer if the last Roman Catholic adoption agency in England and Wales is forced to close down by gay equality laws, Church leaders warned today.

Three Catholic bishops told worshippers that they were taking the case of the Catholic Care adoption agency to the High Court on Wednesday because they were fighting for the rights of vulnerable children to a loving family.

They said that the closure of the adoption agency, which finds new homes for about 20 ‘difficult-to-place’ children each year, would represent the loss of an ‘effective and well-respected resource’.

The agency, which serves the dioceses of Leeds, Middlesbrough and Hallam in South Yorkshire, is the only one of 11 Catholic adoption agencies in the country to continue to fight the Sexual Orientation Regulations (SORs).

The law outlawed discrimination against gay couples in the provision of goods and services and was pushed through Parliament in 2007 in spite of protests from leaders of all the mainstream religious faiths.

It meant that Catholics adoption agencies - which together found new homes for about 250 children in care each year - were obliged to assess same-sex couples as potential adopters or foster parents.

The Catholic Church teaches that gay adoption is ‘gravely immoral’, however, and it has since either closed its adoption agencies or relinquished control of them, without a single agency surviving.

But today Bishop Arthur Roche of Leeds, Bishop John Rawsthorne of Hallam and Bishop Terry Drainey of Middlesbrough vowed to fight to keep Catholic Care open in its present form.

In a letter read out at Masses in hundreds of churches they said the Government was trying to force Catholic Care to operate ‘with disregard to the Church’s teaching on marriage and family life’ even though the agency had a record of placing ‘some of the most vulnerable children to the care of loving families in our region’.

‘Despite the fact that Catholic Care has been able to find caring families for a vast number of needy children we are being invited either to stop our adoption work or stop being a Catholic charity altogether,’ the bishops said.

‘Our position is that it is in the interests of children to continue our work. We are not judging other agencies that accept same sex couples for adoption, but feel strongly that we should not be forced to do so, nor is there a necessity for this to happen.

&#39;We believe that this is a legally justifiable position.’

They said: ‘Our adoption service has been at the heart of the local community for over 100 years.

‘It has been praised and widely appreciated by local authorities and social services, as well as the children who have benefited from this work and the couples who have sought to adopt them.

‘Children have a right to a family life,’ they added. ‘There are too many children awaiting adoption and Catholic Care has a vital and a special role in helping very vulnerable children by finding loving families for them.

‘If Catholic Care is forced to close its adoption service it is children who will lose an effective and well-respected resource in the Yorkshire region.’

The High Court battles comes less than a year after the Charity Tribunal told Catholic Care that it could not continue as an adoption agency unless it accepted gay couples.

The agency had earlier applied to the Charity Commission to change its charitable objects so that it could appeal for an exemption under Regulation 18 of the SORs.

The regulation allows charities to practice limited discrimination in pursuing their objectives effectively.

But the Charity Tribunal ruled that it would be unlawful to allow Regulation 18 to be used as a defence by Catholic Care, saying that the proposed alteration of the objects ‘arose substantially out a desire to maintain a principled stance rather than being specifically designed to advance the ... charitable purpose of the support, relief and care of children and young people without families to care for them’.

The appeal to the High Court will be heard on the same day that the Catholic bishops of England and Wales publishe a pre-General Election document in which they say it is ‘essential’ for politicians to support marriage and the family.

While the main political parties disagree on the importance of heterosexual marriage, with Labour arguing that it was simply a lifestyle choice, they share support for civil partnerships and gay adoption.

Last month Tory frontbencher Nick Herbert, who is openly gay, said homosexuality may be ‘given by God’ and hinted that the Church was wrong to oppose gay marriage and gay adoption.

‘We should not seek to prevent adoption by same-sex couples who may offer a love and stability that is absent from too many homes,’ he told an audience in Washington DC.

He spoke shortly after Pope Benedict XVI told the English and Welsh bishops that the effects of the Government’s equality laws represented a ‘violation of the natural law’ and that they imposed ‘unjust limitations on the freedom of religious communities to act in accordance with their beliefs’.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I would just like to say that I&#39;m damn sure Catholics are a much greater danger to a child than a gay person is, and also that I want them to go explain to the face of every single child stuck in foster and orphanage care exactly why it is they can&#39;t go home with a family that wants to love and take care of them today. And I want them to do that [i]on camera[/i]. I want to hear the words coming out of their mouths while they look at those children without families and lie and lie and lie because they are full of hate and they worship death, and I want it on the fucking record so no one will ever forget what Jesus stands for.</description>

<p>I know I don’t. I only like women, and I can’t help that. It seems to me that you must be bi-sexual, seeing as you have a choice. Maybe you should heed your own warning.</p>

<p>Lol xD. Is England really that bad? According to some of my friends, they like it there. I like America, with all of our freedoms and liberties, but there is some things that hinder it. But, I guess that’s the same with any other country.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/greeny">@Greeny</a>: I really don’t think my age has anything to do with debating. I can have my own opinions as well as any others, no matter your age. (I’m also ahead for my age, by two years.) I understand what the “Healthcare reform” might* do. (*People sometimes react differently then expected, and there can be changes to it).
