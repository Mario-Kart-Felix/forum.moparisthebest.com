<p>I have a few family members that are gay, including a half sister, and I have already discussed with MITB that when we have children and if she is still acting on those feelings, our child will not be allowed to stay at her home.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yet you are perfectly happy with having a child with a man who believes that it is OK to offer your women up to be raped if it stops a man from being sodomised?</p>
<p>Of course MITB would never do that to you or your daughter, but he bases his faith on a book that says it’s OK. He has decided to ignore that part, and pretend it’s some kind of moralistic tale rather than literal I assume (though what the fuck kind of moral that is I am not sure).</p>
<p>Proving while he does so that humans gain their morals from some kind of internal force, not religion. I don’t need your Apocrypha to know what’s good and what’s evil.</p>

<p>I believe that sexual acts are to be between a man and a woman. Sex isn’t something you have with anyone just to feel good. Sex is both meant for unitive and procreative dimensions.</p>

        <p>its so pathetic how you say the bible must be true because god made it so, then when people point things out that you don’t believe in (eg. slavery) you say ‘oh, that’s just something he left for us to decide’. how can you know homosexuality wasn’t one of those things too?

The idea that growing up as the child of gay parents is inevitably bad for you has been largely discredited. A 2005 <a href="http://journals.lww.com/jrnldbp/Abstract/2005/06000/Lesbian_Mothers,_Gay_Fathers,_and_Their_Children_.12.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">review</a> of the research on lesbian mothers and gay fathers found there were no significant developmental differences between their children and those from heterosexual families.</p>
<p>What matters is how you parent, not who you sleep with. If there is a loving family that wants to rescue a child from the horrors of social services, it would be immoral, stupid and disgusting to prevent that.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t think anyone argues that the child wouldn’t grow up just as healthy, physically, as a child with a heterosexual couple as parents.  What I would be concerned about is how they would grow up mentally and spiritually, and unfortunately no university can conduct studies on that.[/quote]</p>
<p>Throughout this people have wondered aloud why anybody would bring up a child in the environment of gay parents. They want to ‘protect’ children from accepting same sex relationships in society.</p>
<p>Nobody mentioned the distinction between physical, mental and spiritual development until after I posted that study. This dishonest moving of the goalposts is typical.</p>
<p>Furthermore the paper I quoted doesn’t focus on physical development at all. Instead it talks about behavioural and mental.</p>
<blockquote>Findings from research suggest that children with lesbian or gay parents are comparable with children with heterosexual parents on key psychosocial developmental outcomes. In many ways, children of lesbian or gay parents have similar experiences of family life compared with children in heterosexual families.</blockquote>
<p>As for spiritual development. Yes it is very likely that the children won’t be brought up in a religion that persecutes their parents. In the same way that black parents won’t bring up their children to be KKK members and Jews won’t bring up their children to be Nazis. You could even question if missing out on spiritual and religious development is such a bad thing. I would.</p>

The Catholic church has a long history of bigotry and being anti-science. On condoms they go against every medical authority in the world. On stem cell research they have lobbied hard to stop Alzheimer’s patients being cured. They opposed the use of painkillers for women in labour because it the pain was a punishment given to Eve. They brutally silenced Galileo when he dared to suggest that the Earth revolved around the Sun.</p>
<p>The rest of society uses the knowledge gained by science to help make better and more moral decisions, but the Catholic church and similar religions think they know better. They get their knowledge not from reason but from faith, taking instruction from voices nobody else can hear.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Now you are just spouting propaganda.</p>
<ol>
<li>They do not go against anyone when it comes to condoms.  They simply advocate abstinence instead of having sex with everyone you see but using a condom.  Nothing wrong with that.</li>
<li>The Catholic Church is NOT against stem cell research.  They are against killing living human beings through abortion and growing test tube babies just to kill them to harvest these stem cells.  There are humane ways to get stem cells for research, such as getting them from umbilical cords, which the Catholic Church supports.</li>
<li>That they would be against pain killers doesn’t even make sense.  I’m positive that this was completely made up.</li>
<li>As with any organization made up of fallible people, the church has made mistakes in the past.  They acknowledged that this was a mistake and issued a public apology for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Catholic church supports science and innovation and adapts to them as more is discovered and new things are invented.  Only when things are in direct contradiction of our faith, the bible, or tradition are they denounced, some quick examples I can think of are abortion and euthanasia.[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They do so. They go against all major medical and scientific bodies. One example I’ll bring up is the World Health Organisation (WHO) an agency of the UN. Examples of their successes are organising the international effort to wipe out smallpox and leading a campaign to immunise children in developing nations against six diseases of childhood - diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, measles and TB. They know what they’re talking about, they’re run by doctors, researchers, immunologists, epidemiology and other experts. And they are against the church’s position.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, you’re absolutely right. I forgot to include the word ‘embryonic’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It makes sense if you think about it from a Catholic point of view. God’s punishment to Eve for eating the fruit was to have terrible suffering in childbirth. If somebody gives painkillers they are interfering with God’s plan and it is righteous to ‘correct’ them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The painkiller thing was eventually renounced by the church in the mid-19th century. Another example of when they changed their mind.</p>
<p>See this extract from a <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BEAYtQVOE38C&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;ots=NVeXVZPB4L&amp;dq=catholic%20church%20against%20painkillers%20labour&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">book</a> talking about the church fighting witches. My bold.</p>
<blockquote>The Church saw its attack on peasant healers as an attack on [i]magic[/i], not medicine. The devil was believed to have real power on earth, and the use of that power by peasant women - whether for good or evil - was frightening to the Church and State. The greater their satanic powers to help themselves, the less they were dependant on God and the Church and the more they were potentially able to use their powers against God's order. Magic charms were thought to be at least as effective as prayer in healing the sick, but prayer was Church-sanctioned and controlled while incantations and charms were not. Thus magic cures, even when successful, were an accursed interference with the will of God, achieved with the help of the devil, and the cure itself was evil. There is no problem in distinguishing God's cure from the devil's, for obviously the Lord would work through priests and doctors rather thenn through peasant women. The wise woman, or witch, had a host of remedies which had been tested for years in use. Many of the herbal remedies developed by witches still have their place in modern pharmacology. They had pain-killers, digestive aids and anti-inflammatory agents. [b]They used ergot for the pain of labor at the time when the Church held that pain in labor was the Lord's just punishment for Eve's original sin.[/b] Ergot derivatives are the principal drug used today to hasten labor and aid in the recovery from childbirth.</blockquote>
<p>Also.</p>
<blockquote>This passage in Genesis 3, and a few others similarly deficient and inconsistent in their translations, have supported a faulty Catholic "theology", to the effect that sexual intercourse in marriage is a necessary evil, and should be only for the purpose of procreation, and that intense suffering in the act of child-bearing is the just and reasonable punishment for sinful woman. At one time it was even taught that a woman's cries and screams in childbirth pleased the ears of God, and two women were once burned to death by the Church in France -- one for accepting a pain-killer during childbirth, and the other for administering it (ES Cowles, Religion and Medicine in the Church, p 18). On the other hand, it has never been considered necessary that man refrain from using labor-saving devices to alleviate the "sorrow" of Adam's "special curse" in agriculture!</blockquote>
<p>Another <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dYFPAgp7ZxUC&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;ots=5U8WZYCucs&amp;dq=ES%20Cowles%2C%20Religion%20and%20Medicine%20in%20the%20Church&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">source</a>.</p>
<p>It certainly happened, I didn’t make it up I promise.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You’re contradicting yourself there. First you say the church should not change it morals for some popular fad and that they should NEVER sacrifice core values for popularity as so many religions are doing these days. Then you admit it was wrong to silence Galileo like that. Remember that in Galileo’s time, one of the church’s values was that the Sun went around the Earth. The church believed it was right and good and that it was a morally justifiable thing to do that to him. The heliocentric model was probably viewed as a popular fad too, you can never tell at the time if new ideas are popular fads or valuable new knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>They’ve changed their moral position now, only after it became obvious the Earth really goes round the Sun and only after the philosophers of the Enlightenment invented the principle of free expression.</p>
<p>The reason I brought all this up is to show that the Catholic Church has been wrong before in important things it once regarded as core values and there is no reason to think it’s not wrong on this.</p>

<p>You’re pointing out all these disgusting and dirty things that happen with unprotected anal sex, but you fail to appreciate that this isn’t grounds for banning something. There are plenty of dirty things that people do which aren’t banned. Things are only banned if they cause harm to others and homosexuality doesn’t. Even if it did lead to AIDS, only the single gay man would be harmed and not society as a whole, therefore there is no grounds for laws to be passed banning it.</p>
<p>Your statistics appear to be contradicted, it seems only 5-10% of HIV/AIDS transmittions are from sex between men, but a whopping 67% are between a male and female. Furthermore, lesbian sex is responsible for even less transmittions, so with your logic we should ban all marriage except one between two women.<br>

<p>The emotionally-charged argument with the blood-in-the-Petri-dish is pretty stupid. It would only convince those who have no idea about anything involving Petri dishes. In proper science you have to have a standard to compare against. This means you have two dishes, one with ‘coliforms’ blood and one with just healthy blood. I’m pretty sure that all blood looks like that when you’ve left it standing in a dish for any length of time. Microbes from the air land on the blood and easily form moulds and clots.[/quote]</p>
<p>Perhaps I was wrong with the reference to the Petri-dish, but it doesn’t take a scientist to know that unprotected anal sex is harmful. Upon inserting your penis into someone’s anus, you automatically expose yourself to a cocktail of harmful bacteria and diseases. I don’t really need to emphasize these dangers any further, as I’m sure you’re more knowledgeable of them than myself.</p>
<p>The only reason that AIDS is more common as a result of heterosexual sex rather than homosexual sex is because most humans are heterosexuals. Homosexuals are obviously a minority so even those statistics you posted point out that AIDS is much more commonly transmitted amongst homosexuals.</p>
<p>However when it comes to AIDS, we’re talking about transmittion. So irrespective of the method of having sex, whether or not a person contracts AIDS is entirely dependent on whom that person is having sex with (correct me if I’m wrong). When I made the quote in my previous post, I was more interested in the diseases that are caused as a result of anal sex.</p>
<p>I know you’re an atheist and so you obviously don’t base your morals on religious teachings. But the fact that homosexual sex is harmful, should be a clear indicator to you that it’s wrong. The law has a obligation to protect society from this harmful trait.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people who sympathize with homosexuality are emotionally driven.</p>
<p>[quote=“Original Daniel, post:27, topic:331353”]What about the notion that what people think of you is less important than love?</p>
<p>Or that you shouldn’t discriminate?</p>
<p>Christian morals are outdated and don’t belong in society.</p>
<p>I wonder what they would do if their child/ren turned out to be gay.[/quote]</p>
<p>Humans can naturally love many things that are harmful, but that doesn’t make them any less harmful. If these harmful traits are ignored, they will spread and have a larger effect on humanity than they already do.</p>

<p>its so pathetic how you say the bible must be true because god made it so, then when people point things out that you don’t believe in (eg. slavery) you say ‘oh, that’s just something he left for us to decide’. how can you know homosexuality wasn’t one of those things too? (rhetorical question)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You have to understand what many people don’t (even some branches of christianity).  The bible was written a long time ago, for and by the people that existed at that time.  Catholics of course believe that the writers of the bible were inspired by God about what to write, but that God did not reveal anything to them that they did not already know at the time.  That is to say God wouldn’t have revealed to them that, for example, the world was round, not flat, that it revolved around the sun, not vice-versa, that slavery, which was practiced by everyone, had to be stopped.  He also did not reveal the future to the writers of the bible, no parts of the bible foretell future events, those parts are just parables or symbolism.</p>
<p>You also have to realise that Christianity is based on the New Testament, which is the latter half of the Christian bible, and while the Old Testament (same as the Jewish Torah) still has relevancy in some of the lessons it has to teach us, it is not the only thing Christianity is based on.  God in the Old Testament was much more of a spiteful, vengeful God than the God of the New Testament, which we believe in now, which is a caring, loving, forgiving God.  The reason for this, as I stated above, is because at the time the books of the Old Testament were written this is the only type of God that the people of the time would understand.</p>
<p>The passage Mopman pointed out, about Sodom and Gomorrah (which God destroyed because the people were all sinners, except the one family God sent his angels to save), did happen, but God didn’t tell Lot to do as he did, and I’m sure he didn’t want that to happen.  This doesn’t mean God wants you to have your daughter raped as opposed to having a man raped, that just doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>The best argument I can think of to the notion that all of these beliefs are coming from people who have been brought up in Christianity (‘indoctrinated’), is srt8.  She was not brought up with any type of faith imposed on her, she or her family did not attend church, except in cases of funerals, weddings and the like everyone goes to.  However after we dated for quite a while, and I took her to church with me a few times, she really started liking it, and as she learns more and more about it she likes it more and more.  It just feels right for her.</p>

<p>The idea that growing up as the child of gay parents is inevitably bad for you has been largely discredited. A 2005 <a href="http://journals.lww.com/jrnldbp/Abstract/2005/06000/Lesbian_Mothers,_Gay_Fathers,_and_Their_Children_.12.aspx" data-bbcode="true">review</a> of the research on lesbian mothers and gay fathers found there were no significant developmental differences between their children and those from heterosexual families.</p>
<p>What matters is how you parent, not who you sleep with. If there is a loving family that wants to rescue a child from the horrors of social services, it would be immoral, stupid and disgusting to prevent that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think anyone argues that the child wouldn’t grow up just as healthy, physically, as a child with a heterosexual couple as parents.  What I would be concerned about is how they would grow up mentally and spiritually, and unfortunately no university can conduct studies on that. [/quote]</p>
<p>Throughout this people have wondered aloud why anybody would bring up a child in the environment of gay parents. They want to ‘protect’ children from accepting same sex relationships in society.</p>
<p>Nobody mentioned the distinction between physical, mental and spiritual development until after I posted that study. This dishonest moving of the goalposts is typical.</p>
<p>Furthermore the paper I quoted doesn’t focus on physical development at all. Instead it talks about behavioural and mental.</p>

<p>Findings from research suggest that children with lesbian or gay parents are comparable with children with heterosexual parents on key psychosocial developmental outcomes.

</aside>
<p>As for spiritual development. Yes it is very likely that the children won’t be brought up in a religion that persecutes their parents. In the same way that black parents won’t bring up their children to be KKK members and Jews won’t bring up their children to be Nazis. You could even question if missing out on spiritual and religious development is such a bad thing. I would.</p>

<p>I think it’s wrong to say the Catholic Church ‘persecutes’ gay people.  Having gay sex is a sin in the Catholic religion, but it doesn’t go any further than that, there is certainly no ‘persecution’.  But the point is that Catholic orphanages should have the right to choose suitable adoptive parents for the children under their supervision according to the beliefs of the Catholic church.  Just like they wouldn’t adopt a kid off to a married man and woman who were swingers, satanists, or drug addicts.  And it’s ridiculous for a government to try and deny them that right.</p>

<p>The Catholic church has a long history of bigotry and being anti-science. On condoms they go against every medical authority in the world. On stem cell research they have lobbied hard to stop Alzheimer’s patients being cured. They opposed the use of painkillers for women in labour because it the pain was a punishment given to Eve. They brutally silenced Galileo when he dared to suggest that the Earth revolved around the Sun.</p>
<p>The rest of society uses the knowledge gained by science to help make better and more moral decisions, but the Catholic church and similar religions think they know better. They get their knowledge not from reason but from faith, taking instruction from voices nobody else can hear.</p>

<p>Now you are just spouting propaganda.</p>
<ol>
<li>They do not go against anyone when it comes to condoms.  They simply advocate abstinence instead of having sex with everyone you see but using a condom.  Nothing wrong with that.</li>
<li>The Catholic Church is NOT against stem cell research.  They are against killing living human beings through abortion and growing test tube babies just to kill them to harvest these stem cells.  There are humane ways to get stem cells for research, such as getting them from umbilical cords, which the Catholic Church supports.</li>
<li>That they would be against pain killers doesn’t even make sense.  I’m positive that this was completely made up.</li>
<li>As with any organization made up of fallible people, the church has made mistakes in the past.  They acknowledged that this was a mistake and issued a public apology for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Catholic church supports science and innovation and adapts to them as more is discovered and new things are invented.  Only when things are in direct contradiction of our faith, the bible, or tradition are they denounced, some quick examples I can think of are abortion and euthanasia.<br>

<ol>
<li>
<p>They do so. They go against all major medical and scientific bodies. One example I’ll bring up is the World Health Organisation (WHO) an agency of the UN. Examples of their successes are organising the international effort to wipe out smallpox and leading a campaign to immunise children in developing nations against six diseases of childhood - diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, measles and TB. They know what they’re talking about, they’re run by doctors, researchers, immunologists, epidemiology and other experts. And they are against the church’s position.<br>

<p>Yes, you’re absolutely right. I forgot to include the word ‘embryonic’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It makes sense if you think about it from a Catholic point of view. God’s punishment to Eve for eating the fruit was to have terrible suffering in childbirth. If somebody gives painkillers they are interfering with God’s plan and it is righteous to ‘correct’ them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The painkiller thing was eventually renounced by the church in the mid-19th century. Another example of when they changed their mind.</p>

<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The Church saw its attack on peasant healers as an attack on <span class="bbcode-i">magic</span>, not medicine. The devil was believed to have real power on earth, and the use of that power by peasant women - whether for good or evil - was frightening to the Church and State. The greater their satanic powers to help themselves, the less they were dependant on God and the Church and the more they were potentially able to use their powers against God’s order. Magic charms were thought to be at least as effective as prayer in healing the sick, but prayer was Church-sanctioned and controlled while incantations and charms were not. Thus magic cures, even when successful, were an accursed interference with the will of God, achieved with the help of the devil, and the cure itself was evil. There is no problem in distinguishing God’s cure from the devil’s, for obviously the Lord would work through priests and doctors rather thenn through peasant women. The wise woman, or witch, had a host of remedies which had been tested for years in use. Many of the herbal remedies developed by witches still have their place in modern pharmacology. They had pain-killers, digestive aids and anti-inflammatory agents. <span class="bbcode-b">They used ergot for the pain of labor at the time when the Church held that pain in labor was the Lord’s just punishment for Eve’s original sin.</span> Ergot derivatives are the principal drug used today to hasten labor and aid in the recovery from childbirth.</p>

<p>This passage in Genesis 3, and a few others similarly deficient and inconsistent in their translations, have supported a faulty Catholic “theology”, to the effect that sexual intercourse in marriage is a necessary evil, and should be only for the purpose of procreation, and that intense suffering in the act of child-bearing is the just and reasonable punishment for sinful woman. At one time it was even taught that a woman’s cries and screams in childbirth pleased the ears of God, and two women were once burned to death by the Church in France – one for accepting a pain-killer during childbirth, and the other for administering it (ES Cowles, Religion and Medicine in the Church, p 18). On the other hand, it has never been considered necessary that man refrain from using labor-saving devices to alleviate the “sorrow” of Adam’s “special curse” in agriculture!</p>

<p>It certainly happened, I didn’t make it up I promise.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You’re contradicting yourself there. First you say the church should not change it morals for some popular fad and that they should NEVER sacrifice core values for popularity as so many religions are doing these days. Then you admit it was wrong to silence Galileo like that. Remember that in Galileo’s time, one of the church’s values was that the Sun went around the Earth. The church believed it was right and good and that it was a morally justifiable thing to do that to him. The heliocentric model was probably viewed as a popular fad too, you can never tell at the time if new ideas are popular fads or valuable new knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>They’ve changed their moral position now, only after it became obvious the Earth really goes round the Sun and only after the philosophers of the Enlightenment invented the principle of free expression.</p>
<p>The reason I brought all this up is to show that the Catholic Church has been wrong before in important things it once regarded as core values and there is no reason to think it’s not wrong on this.[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Again, the catholic church goes against no one when it comes to condoms.  It believes that sex should only occur in a marriage between a man and a women, and that, since marriages should be open to children, there should be no <span class="bbcode-b">artificial</span> forms of contraception between the man and the woman.  They do, however, support natural and more effective methods of birth control such as <a href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/women/contraceptive/126.html" data-bbcode="true">Natural Family Planning</a>.  So explain again how they go against any medical authority when it comes to condoms?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those quotes show that the Catholic Church was against witchcraft, and at the time many medicinal practices were considered witchcraft, so of course they would have been against them.  No true catholic today is going to say that pain killers are evil though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I might be using the wrong words here, I’m not a church historian or anything.  Core morals are different than beliefs.  Believing that the sun revolves around the earth or vice-versa is not a moral belief that can’t change or, really, anything that matters.  Other things are moral beliefs, shouldn’t be changed, and do matter.  Examples of these are the belief that murder is wrong, sex should only occur in marriage between a man and a woman, stealing is wrong, lying is wrong etc etc.  There is a big difference and therefore just because the Church has changed it’s belief on things that don’t matter, like what spatial body revolves around what, doesn’t mean it can or should change it’s stance on certain moral issues.</p>

<p>You also have to realise that Christianity is based on the New Testament, which is the latter half of the Christian bible, and while the Old Testament (same as the Jewish Torah) still has relevancy in some of the lessons it has to teach us, it is not the only thing Christianity is based on.  God in the Old Testament was much more of a spiteful, vengeful God than the God of the New Testament, which we believe in now, which is a caring, loving, forgiving God.  The reason for this, as I stated above, is because at the time the books of the Old Testament were written this is the only type of God that the people of the time would understand. </p>
