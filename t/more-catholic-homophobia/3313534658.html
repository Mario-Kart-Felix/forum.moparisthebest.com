<p>I do not understand how some of you can so easily dismiss the fact that Jesus did exist. There’s proof!</p>
<p>How can you go outside at night, look up at the stars, and not believe there was a higher power working there??</p>
<p>And as to Jesus existing, there is actual physical proof recorded in government records of the time, Roman and Jewish at least. All I can say is that before meeting MITB and learning of his faith, I was not religious at all. My family has had a lot of tragedies over the last 20 years, and I didn’t know what we did to deserve everything. But after going to Mass, and speaking with our Deacon I decided I had it all wrong.</p>
<p>As to the thread topic, being gay is wrong and it says this in the Bible. Thinking about it is not the sin, but acting on the feelings is. So why raise a child in that environment? I have a few family members that are gay, including a half sister, and I have already discussed with MITB that when we have children and if she is still acting on those feelings, our child will not be allowed to stay at her home.[/quote]</p>
<p>No one is denying he didn’t exist. Surely he did. Did he do all that shit the bible says he did? More than likely not. The fictional character comes from the fact that it was a work of fiction. If a book is made about me flying through the sky with wings, I’m then a fictional character because I don’t actually do that. You’re believing a book that was written by people who didn’t witness the acts, that has been changed many times to include and kick out different stories, that has been translated and meaning has been lost in that as well.</p>
<p>Because of what you believe in this book, you are discriminating against other human beings. You are judging people even though in your book only God shall judge.</p>
<p>And what happens to other faiths? Just because they believe in a different God they go to hell? Or they are wrong because they allow gays?</p>
<p>It makes me fucking sick.</p>

        <p>I’m still dumbfounded by the fact that there are people who think that the bible was based on real events.<br>
I agree with everything the bible is trying to teach morally (including slavery, fuck yeah) but for someone to say those events really happened is really pushing the ignorance limit (ever heard of symbolism?)</p>

Thats stupid to deny your child the right to see a family member due to them being a homosexual, that is absolutely wrong and discriminatory. And Jesus wouldve been a popular name at the time there were probably quite a few running around, in fact thats probably why the name was chosen at the time people could whisper and rumour about an amazing person called jesus but because there were so many jesus’ around no one would actually know who it was but it would keep hope up and so on. Then someone decided to write it down and hey presto your hope giving rumours have just become a religion. What people believe in is up to them, personally i find karma a damn good system, but raising your child in your ways is wrong, i know a few girls that have been brought up by devout christian families and their lives are utter torture they cannot do anything they want to, you should let the child choose. Also taking everything the bible says as fact is going to fuck you up, its one of the most contradictory books in all of history so take it with a pinch of salt <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>That is disgusting, and only helps the ‘christian bashing’ in this thread. Are you worried the homosexual family members won’t be able to control themselves and start humping in front of the kids or something? Perhaps that the homosexuality will rub off onto them?</p>

She doesn’t want her kids to be influenced into a belief that same sex relationships are OK. She’s protecting them from the notion that ‘anything is OK as long as it feels good’.</p>
<p>Just because it feels good, it doesn’t make it alright.</p>

        <p>It is ironic how many people on this forum are against this homophobia but calls people they don’t like “fags” or “faggots” all the time.</p>
<p>I am not strongly opposed homosexuality but I hate when people brand it as a completely different culture and something purely sexual. I don’t like the fact that they like the same sex but we just have to live with it.</p>
<p>Gay/lesbian couples shouldn’t be able to adopt straight away, simply because it will fuck up the child’s mind. I think they should past some sort of test that proves that they will look after the child like he/she would be in a normal family and not force/encourage the child to become homosexual themselves.</p>

<p>That is disgusting, and only helps the ‘christian bashing’ in this thread. Are you worried the homosexual family members won’t be able to control themselves and start humping in front of the kids or something? Perhaps that the homosexuality will rub off onto them?</p>

        <p>I’m just going to say that there is alot more reason to appreciate the world we have and all of the possibilities that we and only we have created rather than give “God” all of the credit.</p>
<p>The ignorance and refusal to see outside of the box is religions downfall. By holding society back with the words of men thousands of years dead we are standing still in time, ceasing to move forward and create and refine the perfect world for our children. I’m just glad that more and more people are begining to see that we don’t need to rely on some being in the sky to solve our problems, we can solve them ourselves.</p>
<p>And Str8, surely you know and love your half sister, and see that her being gay doesn’t make her a bad person, it doesn’t mean she is corrupt and full of “sin”. You share the same blood and yet you aren’t willing to trust her with your own child. It’s as if you have let religion take away the core components of “family”.<br>
Religion is fail.</p>

<p>Maybe at the end of the day the “Jesus” knows, but at the End of Days, who will judge ye but the Flying Spaghetti Monster? If ye be untouched by his noodly appendage, then woe unto you, sinners, for all who deny the Flying Spaghetti Monster shall be cast down into hellfire and damnation for eternity!</p>
<p><img src="http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/5769/touchedbyhisnoodlyappen.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>For truly I say unto you that Flying Spaghetti Monster is the light and salt of the world, the alpha and the omega, that which is and always and forever shall be. To deny him is to deny yourself. When you speak against the lowliest sinner you sin against the Lord-god, omnipotent Flying Spaghetti Monster, forever unto ages of ages amen. There is no escape from his noodly appendage, it touches all things equally. The noodly appendage of providence shines forth in righteousness forever.</p>

<p>My family has had a lot of tragedies over the last 20 years, and I didn’t know what we did to deserve everything. But after going to Mass, and speaking with our Deacon I decided I had it all wrong.[/quote]</p>
<p>Every family has tragedies… It’s part of life.</p>
<p>[quote]I have a few family members that are gay, including a half sister, and I have already discussed with MITB that when we have children and if she is still acting on those feelings, our child will not be allowed to stay at her home.</p>

</aside>
<p>That is disgusting, and only helps the ‘christian bashing’ in this thread. Are you worried the homosexual family members won’t be able to control themselves and start humping in front of the kids or something? Perhaps that the homosexuality will rub off onto them?</p>
<p>Think back to before you were brainwashed - what would you have thought about something like this back then?</p>

</aside>
<p>She doesn’t want her kids to be influenced into a belief that same sex relationships are OK. She’s protecting them from the notion that ‘anything is OK as long as it feels good’.</p>
<p>Just because it feels good, it doesn’t make it alright.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That is exactly what I’m trying to say!</p>
<p>I do not judge these family members, and love them very much. But, I do not want my child’s young mind to be confused by their actions.</p>

<p>We all judge others. We are human beings and we sin. That is why Jesus died for us and our sins. I try really, really hard everyday to leave the judging up to the Lord but at the end of the day he knows, understands, and forgives the fact that we are sinners.[/quote]</p>
<p>You only think that because he is a figment of your imagination.</p>
<p>Your child won’t be confused by their actions. Seeing gay people doesn’t confuse people. Seeing gay people won’t make you turn gay. Being gay is okay. Just because your child sees gay people and thinks it’s okay, doesn’t mean he’ll turn gay because it’s okay. He might have already been gay and that helped him come out, but it won’t turn him gay. Worst case: He’ll experiment and not like it. At least your kid would be more accepting than you.</p>
<p>Imagine the tables are turned. Imagine I made up a religion that says all Christians believe everything wrong and they should be punished, segregated, discriminated, etc. Imagine Christians are nice people who are just being who they are (tough thought I know). So now the majority goes with my religion and we all hate you and take away some of your rights. How do you feel?</p>

        <p>A response to MujaheD’s post about AIDS: It’s spread via vaginal sex too. There are more straight people on this planet then homosexuals. So to prevent the spread of AIDS, we should kill everyone.</p>
<p>You’re theory is flawed. Do you think that Africans with AIDS should be put to death? Africa is an AIDS infested continent. And what do religions do? They say it’s bad to use condoms. They obviously don’t understand that straight people have sexual needs too, and they don’t always suppress them.</p>
<p>I doubt kids become real homosexuals when they see one. Children want to become everything they find interesting. Is their father a firefighter, then they want to become a firefighter. But do they become a firefighter? No. Once they grow up, they realize that they don’t like being a firefighter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>did you know that in ancient greece, almost everyone had gay sex?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They also had sex with little boys, so that is alright too?  If anything this just proves my point.</p>
<p>[quote=“SomethingToHide, post:21, topic:331353”]Because of what you believe in this book, you are discriminating against other human beings. You are judging people even though in your book only God shall judge.</p>
<p>And what happens to other faiths? Just because they believe in a different God they go to hell? Or they are wrong because they allow gays?[/quote]</p>
<p>The bible doesn’t teach people to discriminate against other human beings, or to judge them.  That is just a fact of life.  People judge a murderer guilty, and they judge a pedophile and sentence them to not be around children.  Those are moral decisions based on something, are they not?  And if you were giving a child up for adoption would you want them adopted by a murderer, or a pedophile?  Of course not.  It isn’t that clear-cut with homosexuality, but if it is something that goes against your core beliefs (and nature) then you shouldn’t have to put a kid in that environment.  But also as Mopman said, you wouldn’t want to put a child with a raving lunatic that calls themselves a Christian either, but is really a nutjob.</p>
<p>There are crazy people everywhere, and just how I can’t judge all atheists to be satan-worshiping child sacrificers, you can’t judge all Christians to be bible-thumping, by-the-book, go to church every day and don’t allow dancing or playing cards crazies either.</p>
<p>[quote=“la­wl, post:22, topic:331353”]I’m still dumbfounded by the fact that there are people who think that the bible was based on real events.<br>
I agree with everything the bible is trying to teach morally (including slavery, fuck yeah) but for someone to say those events really happened is really pushing the ignorance limit (ever heard of symbolism?)[/quote]</p>
<p>Some of the bible is based on real events.  But of course a lot of it is, as you say, symbolism, or stories that convey a greater moral message.  Speaking in parables was very popular at the time the book was written.  This is the belief of the Catholic church.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/all.html">@all</a> the people saying it’s wrong to raise our children the way srt8 said,</p>
<p>As Lothy already stated, so we can’t raise them like we want to, but a gay couple could raise them any way they see fit?  Doesn’t seem right to me.  Also someone said we should just let our children do whatever they want, great idea!  If they want to torture animals, or people, let them!  Hang around with drug dealers and pedophiles?  Sure.  They are curious about if the train would stop for them if they stood on the rail road tracks?  Let them find out.  Damn, I hope you never have kids. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
[hr]</p>
<p>This thread isn’t about judgment as you normally think about it (ie, that dude is a bad person) but instead about the kind of judgment everyone in a parental situation has to deal with, choosing what is best for the children under their supervision.  Obviously the Catholic church doesn’t think being raised in a homosexual household is best for these children, and they have a right to think that, which this law is infringing upon.</p>
