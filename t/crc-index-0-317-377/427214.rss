    <title>CRC Index 0 (317-377)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crc-index-0-317-377/427214</link>
    <description>I&#39;m researching the client a bit, and found something unusual; All of the CRC values are read from the update server, and from the login server, but I cannot find what the first (0) index is used for. Does anyone have any idea, or is it just another poorly programmed cascading effect?

Also, crc[8] is read as the sounds, but it is the value that the client depends on to start up properly. What is the point of having it be the sound checksum, or was it simply a cheap hack to &quot;increase&quot; cache integrity?</description>
