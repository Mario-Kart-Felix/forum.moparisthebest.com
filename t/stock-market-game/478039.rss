    <title>Stock market game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stock-market-game/478039</link>
    <description>Now I play this app called market millionaire which is a simulation of the stock market in real times. The game starts you off when 100k with no stocks. So I invested in apple and lost over 10k.  I also had google, gold, and amazon, yet I decided to drop them and invested and two other companies and silver, silver a company my dad told me to try out. The two companies I invested in made me all my money back with 5k extra, while losing money from silver until today. I decide to watch the stocks for a little longer since tomorrow it will be my fourth day on the game, yet I believe I have found two stocks that might go up to $200 a share by next year.  The first stock is a energy company which is planing a big launch at the end of this year that will make it one of the biggest clean energy company.  The second company has a new owner starting this year and the stock has been going up ever since.  Both of this stocks don&#39;t even cost more then $2, yet by reading their news update which this app provides it is showing them to be great this coming year.

                  What do you guys think I should do and if you say invest in apple then I would say hell no apple is a dying stock without Steve Jobs and new ideas.</description>

If you go for lesser valued shares and research em well the profit margin can be very high although it can be very bad also.<br>
What game are you playing? I want to try it lol</p>

<p>apple stock is way too loveing expensive almost 700 per stock, hell no<br>
and people buy usually buy atleast 200<br>
200x700 = 140,000 Now is not the time to buy<br>
Steve Jobs is an innovator but Im pretty sure they can survive on their own.<br>
But I wouldn’t bet on apple because its over 700<br>
Tim cook is good but their products and OS is getting old<br>
They are too careful and unwilling to change.<br>
when ever I use my ipad, sometimes I kinda feel I am still in 2008<br>
they update their products every year with minor changes which i am sad about<br>
Google made a good move with JellyBean but both stock are too much</p>
