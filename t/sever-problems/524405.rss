    <description>Where in my server source is the file that I see what ip its trying to connect to.. I don&#39;t see one in source, only in my client which the file in client is client.java... Whats the file called in my server source? 

Also What ip do I put it under so just me can connect.. I tried 0.0.0.0 and I can&#39;t connect, I just checked and my 43594 port is open, but nothing will work.. I even tried my own ip and 43594 port in those 2 port spots and those 2 ip spots.. What do I do.. 
Is this right to connect for my self? Because its not working.. And what do I put in as port I just want to play it privately while i am working on it [URL=http://swiftkit.net][IMG]http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/2071/mrfp.png[/img][/URL]

              <p>Yes, you got that error because there is 2 lines that are the exact same, that’s what I was pointing out. Probably why one was commented.<br>
You can also try setting it to: 127.0.0.1<br>
That’s localhost too, but just in a different format</p>
