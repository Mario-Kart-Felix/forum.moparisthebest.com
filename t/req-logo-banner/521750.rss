              <p>I would suggest making an own instead of stealing from others. I really dislike the fact that you are trying to get people rip someone elses job for you! That’s like the exact opposite of doing something yourself! It’s well comparable to these “Could you code a server for me? I would then just put it online, and hey, I’m so generous I let you be admin in my server!” Your account name seems very legit for this way of acting “I got guts”.</p>
<p>And back to the image, a picture like that is very easy to make and taking the frame from the .gif that doesn’t have the flashing text is just a few clicks in the right program. The “Relive Bounty Hunter” part would be much trickier to remove neatly than making the picture from scratch!</p>
