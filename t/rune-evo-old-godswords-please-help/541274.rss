    <title>[Rune-Evo] Old Godswords? Please Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rune-evo-old-godswords-please-help/541274</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m currently trying to re-write Rune-Evo v3 completely. I want to make a unique server and then in time release it with credits to all who help with certain things! I&#39;m looking to pack the looks of the &quot;old&quot; godswords into the server, I just can&#39;t stand the looks of the new godswords and I&#39;m sure others would prefer the old look anyways :P Maybe, quite possibly, if it&#39;s possible lol I would rather have it to be interchangable to where players can type ::oldlook or ::newlook. If anyone can help me, message me here and I&#39;ll reply with my skype name if needed.

Thanks for your time. Sincerely yours,
