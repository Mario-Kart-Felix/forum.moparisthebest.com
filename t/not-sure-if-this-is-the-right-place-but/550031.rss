              <p>No I’m not sure if localhost was the right address, but it was the only one that worked.  As far as phpadmin I don’t know my way around it enough to tell.  So i’m not sure I could tell you.</p>
<p>Edit:  The gtl voting is working except for one thing the user selects a reward and they get the one above this i believe is server sided.</p>

              <p>Technically, this is a website issue.<br>
Here’s a quick guide to explain how to tell the difference:</p>
<p>Is your RuneScape <span class="bbcode-u">SERVER</span> showing an error, compiling and showing an error, or is it sending an error to the client?<br>
Then it’s a server-related issue and belongs in the <span class="bbcode-b">Server Help</span> section.</p>
<p>Is your RuneScape <span class="bbcode-u">CLIENT</span> showing an error, compiling and showing an error, not loading, or freezing?<br>
Then it’s client-related and goes in the <span class="bbcode-b">Client Help</span> section.</p>
<p>Are you trying to modify something in the <span class="bbcode-u">CACHE</span>, the maps/objects/models/players/npcs/etc not showing, a sprite not working/showing, a button not working/showing, or an interface not working/showing?<br>
Then it’s client-related and goes in the <span class="bbcode-b">Client Help</span> section. (There are no Cache sections… Client reads the cache data anyways).</p>
<p>Is it an error displaying on your website, an error in your website’s logfiles, or something on your website not displaying correctly?<br>
Then it’s website-related and belongs in the <span class="bbcode-b">Web Design/Development</span> section.</p>
<p>[hr]<br>
As for your issue: Are you sure that you needed to set “localhost” as the database IP? And double check what accounts exist in your phpMyAdmin</p>
