    <title>The first rule</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-first-rule/527196</link>
    <description>Now I know the first rule of Fight Club, but I&#39;ve gotta say, it&#39;s not as good as I expected.

I was expecting some movie similar to &quot;Never Back Down&quot; or &quot;Warrior&quot; but despite that, it was an ok movie.
Have you guys watched it, whats your opinion?</description>

<p>When I saw it, my interpretation was that he had dissociative identity disorder.[/quote]The movie starts out with him going to all these “help groups” with a new identity every time. When he takes the airplane he finally meets a fictional character Tyler Durden (with the main character’s name still unspoken). Basically Tyler (the main character, the real one) was tired of his life and noticed he couldn’t change it for himself, so he basically created an alternate ego to carry out his new life. So that the ‘new’ Tyler was just him the entire time.  It’s a little more deep than that, it’s been a couple years since I saw it last but I was pretty mind-fucked when I realized what happened haha.</p>
