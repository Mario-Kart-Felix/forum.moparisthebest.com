    <description>Ok so i&#39;m having trouble playing on clients with stuff like D claws and D plate etc. I think those are called 508 servers. I am very noobish with this stuff, I played mopar for years on the web client and just played on servers but now everything needs clients. So heres my problem when ever i try to log into a server like Stabbing scape or chris-scape, It always says error connecting to server, I know the servers arn&#39;t down because this has been going on for a couple of days and people say in there posts that there playing it. So can someone help me?</description>
