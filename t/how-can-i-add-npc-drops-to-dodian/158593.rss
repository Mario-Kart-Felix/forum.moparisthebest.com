    <title>How Can I add NPC Drops To Dodian?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-add-npc-drops-to-dodian/158593</link>
    <description>I know how to add drops to Hellzend, it envolves item.java and npchandler, but how do I add NPcdrops to dodian, because I did they same thing with Dodian as I did Hellzend, but in dodian, everytime you hit the monster it drops, instead of actually killing it.

Thanks,
