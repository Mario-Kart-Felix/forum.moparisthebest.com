<p>Here’s the article</p>
<blockquote>In this day and age it seems as though more times than none when we pick up a newspaper or turn on the nightly news that we hear of children being beaten/tortured/raped/murdered by parents,loved ones, or babysitters. It’s really heart breaking. So let me ask you, as a parent, what would you do if you found someone had hurt your child? Would you call the police or take matters into your own hands? What if you had already called the police previously and they did nothing but write their standard police report?
<p>The father in this story is 29-year-old patent attorney from Fairfield, Connecticut named Jonathon Edington. To most people you ask about Mr. Edington he’s a well respected young family man that loves and cherishes his 2 year old daughter. Jonathon and his wife Christina had filed previous police reports involving their 59 year old neighbor, Barry James of walking around his 1st floor bedroom naked. Some of you might say, “That is Barry James’s business how he walks around his home,” but you see it’s adjacent to the toddler’s room. In fact the toddler saw Mr. James naked and that’s when her parent’s called police. Nothing was done except for the routine police report and the advice from the police to “put up mini-blinds and/or curtains.”</p>
<p>A short time later Christina, and her daughter were on an outing to Rhode Island to visit her family. At that time the child confided in her mother that she didn’t want to go home because she was scared of the neighbor Barry James. When the mother questioned the child about why she was scared the little girl told her, “Barry comes into my room at night and puts “it” (she pointed to the genitals) on my belly and my nose. He also makes noises that sound like hee-haw and it feels like I got rained on.” The horrified young mother then called and explained the allegations to her husband.</p>
<p>On 8-28-06, Mr. Edington, furious and in a “fit of rage” retrieved a kitchen knife, entered Mr. James’s room through a window and stabbed him 13 times in the chest, heart and hand, fatally wounding him. He then left, went home, called 911 and told the dispatcher to send an ambulance and police to the home because someone had been stabbed. When police arrived Jonathon was washing blood off his hands and the bloody knife was nearby.</p>
<p>In June 2007, Mr. Edington pled guilty of 1st degree manslaughter but in October 2007 the judge sentenced Jonathon to 12 years in prison and 5 years probation.</p>
<p>Barry James’ family still deny the molestation allegations and said that their son/brother had been killed for no reason at all. They’ve filed a $5,000,000 lawsuit against Mr. Edington and have filed a civil lawsuit against Mrs. Edington for telling her husband about the abuse in which he then killed the man. The family attorney, Richard Maahan Jr., has stated that he thought it was unlikely that a child as young as Edington’s daughter could make those statements. He also stated, “I have a granddaughter that age who I think is a bright and precocious child but even she couldn’t articulate these type of accusations.” Police have also said they can not prove the allegations of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>So I guess just because his granddaughter can not “articulate” things such as these that neither can this child huh?!? I have a hard time believing a child of this age could make up a story such as this.</p>
<p>So my questions to you, our faithful readers, are: Was Mr. Edington justified for killing Barry James? Were the local police at fault, to a degree, being as how they wouldn’t follow up on the claim Mr. James exposed himself to the child previously? Should Mr. James’ family be awarded monetary damages due to the death? Finally what would you do in this situation?</p>

<p>This WAS a while ago but i still feel that this story is… beyond sad. Any thoughts from the users of a rsps site? LOL</p>

        <p>The police of today are idiots so it doesn’t surprise me they didn’t follow up.</p>
<p>They would rather put cuffs on you and say it’s for “everyone’s safety” than actually read you your Miranda rights first. If they can go against something so  minuscule as that then they obviously are going to do what they want.</p>
