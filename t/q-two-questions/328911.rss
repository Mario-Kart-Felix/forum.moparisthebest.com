[b]Questions[/b][/u]

[ul][li]How to change the IP address of the server so when people try to connect, they connect to my IP address. Not 127.0.0.1[/li]
[li]How to fix this error I get when I try to compile a .java file:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

              <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:1, topic:328918”]I presume you’re using EasyRSC (or NOOBScape, which is basically EasyRSC) so you will need to open ‘server.java’ and change 127.0.0.1 (or localhost) to your internal IP (such as 192.168.1.1). You will then need to open your routers settings that you’re presumably sat behind and port forward the port you’re using (probably 43594) to the IP on your network that the server is hosted on.</p>
<p>‘javac’ is the Java compiler (JDK). You will need to download and install Java JDK. If you’ve already done then you will need to setup your Java path.[/quote]</p>
<p>your wrong. JDK isnät needed, easier way is to use apache ant and download tool.jar.</p>
