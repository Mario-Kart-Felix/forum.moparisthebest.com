    <title>[508] Making tree dissapear and respawn for WC?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-making-tree-dissapear-and-respawn-for-wc/457328</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m using drowing 508, which is a pali base, and we have run into a minor bug with wood cutting.

Tree&#39;s can be infinitely cut without dissapearing for a while like the real RS.

Is there a simple way of making tree&#39;s dissapear after a certain amount of time being cut? And also re-appear after some time too?

I&#39;ve looked around for possible ways, I haven&#39;t found any working ones so far.</description>

              <p>So, are you suggesting that code made for a 317 would work on a 508?</p>
<p>Also, still looking for any code on woodcutting with dissapearing trees, no luck so far.</p>
<p>Either that or the search bar hates me.</p>
<p>*EDIT: Turns out I found some great code that’s almost 100% woodcutting, only problem is that it’s only been tested on RS2HD r219 508’s, so how would I go about editing that for Palidino?</p>

<p>Use a design like Object Health to control Globjects. This can be used for both spawning and removing the Globject. I’m not sure if Drowning508 has anything similar already implemented. This can also be used for Fishing Spots changing, the barriers at the Dag King ladder, ect.<br>

<p>Thanks for the reply, Although we are looking for a system similar to Runescape where a player cuts a certain amount of logs from a tree, and it turns the normal tree model into a stump that is not cutable, which returns to its normal model after a while, is there any way to do this in a 508? I’ve seen it on a 562 but not 508.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s exactly what I’ve said. Of course you can do this in a 508, you can do this in any revision. I recommend you take a peak at how others do this.</p>
