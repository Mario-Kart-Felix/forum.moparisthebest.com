    <title>CirnoPK - A unique storkpk based server! [4 months running, stable economy]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cirnopk-a-unique-storkpk-based-server-4-months-running-stable-economy/541550</link>
    <description>This is a StorkPK-based Pk server with lots of upgrades, additions, and new content. it is point based with a strong economy.  When you PK, you actually are rewarded with items of VALUE!  Additionally, we&#39;ve implemented tons of little improvements to make PKing/Clan wars fun for all.  For example, god staffs and capes are only obtainable through trading and drops from NPCs (a rarer drop).  Additionally, during clan wars, each clan is limited to TWO god magers per team.
