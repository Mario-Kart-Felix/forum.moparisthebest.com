[B][U]Description:[/U][/B]
Livid Farmer is the script designed to get those pesky produce points in the Livid Farm activity.  While rapidly and automatically gaining points, you&#39;ll be receiving a heft amount of Farming and Magic exp as well as a good dose of Crafting and Agility exp and slight Construction exp!  This script marks our first Activity script as well as our first Farming script, not to mention one of the very few Combo scripts.  The average XP/Hour for this script is mid 30,000&#39;s for Farming and mid to upper 30,000&#39;s for Magic.  The other two I forget, sorry...


[B][U]Features:[/U][/B]
*Cures livids, fertilizes soil, energizes Pauline, handles all produce, and all fence repairs!
*[B]Very[/B] fast
*Solid break system (By Echo_) with cool graphics!
*World switching option (If enabled, switches worlds after every break)
*SRL Stats
*On-Screen progress report
*Failsafes to ensure endurance

[B][U]Not yet added:[/U][/B]
*Handling random occurrences (Monster examine and give vengeance)

[B][U]AntiBans:[/U][/B]
*Human&#39;ish waiting periods
*Camera rotating and angle adjusting

[B][U]How to use:[/U][/B] 
*Start anywhere within the garden area
*Have your runes or runes + mud staffs in you inventory/equipped
*[U]You MUST have the absolute newest Reflection 2[/U], get it [URL=http://&quot;https://github.com/Drags111/Reflection_Dev/archives/master&quot;]here[/URL].

[B][U]Credits:[/U][/B] 
*HUGE thanks to Pyroryan for all his time and answering my stupid questions
*Echo_ as always for his air-tight breaking system.
[/center]

[B][U]Update log:[/U][/B]
[U]V1.03:[/U] 
*Fixed a big problem with taking breaks, works correctly now
*Patched the problem of walking outside the area
*Redid the strain-finding and added a sure fail-safe


[U]V1.1:[/U] 
*Full fence-repair handling! (Take logs, convert to planks, repair fences)
*Added smart fail-safes for the strain-finding.
*Produce points gained now displayed

[U]V1.11:[/U] (Minor changes)
*Check if we have enough runes, if not the script logs us out and stops
*Checks for outdated Reflection hooks

[U]V1.12:[/U] (Minor changes)
*The two loops breakable in the case of outside walking and/or random events.

[End Note]:

This was quite an easy script to make now that &quot;models&quot; are included in our Reflection library.  I know it&#39;s not always perfect in a couple areas, but I&#39;ve made sure that it&#39;s never enough to seriously harm the script.  Please post progress reports and [I]major[/I] bugs!

To get the script please visit the original post.
