    <title>Few things you may not have realized</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-things-you-may-not-have-realized/164151</link>
    <description>Here we go, few facts that will surprise you if you didnt know.

First off, the richies. The ones that jagex doesnt like for being pure rich and enjoying the game.
Jagex does start to realize there is to much money in the game how do they stop this? They make you buy by THEIR prices.
Easy thing that could have done: Created a Dragon Platebody Sold it in the legends guild 100m a plate.
And made it untradeable. That would chunk about.... 5B of money out of the game.

You must buy by their prices. Whips currently are 1.25m, jagex&#39;s database price: 1.37... You can buy for 1373k or 1367k, 3k above or              
below. No more merchanting, unless you want a 3k profit each time  :)

Today me and my friend were talking and he brought up mechscape. I figured, if they ruin it too much, when they see we are starting to not play, they point us all at a beta of mech. Good idea? Not really.

To stop the chinese, jagex could have simply, made you not be able to trade more than 100k worth of items until you are lvl 20, then you cant trade more than 200k worth of items until lvl 40, then from 40-50 no more than 500k, 50+ any amount pleased.

Who lost the war? Jagex. The autoers are gunna get the money on the account then just SELL the account itself... Buying a lvl 3 with 15m cash on it to lvl 20 just to get it? They really messed up their game. The game i once enjoyed. Started dieing when the pest control update came.

<p>Most Chinese people are NOT botting for gold, you suck at sentence syntax.  And definitely not the Japanese, so get your facts straight.</p>
<p>And your dad working with Japanese cannot give you immunity from being racist and impunity to be racist.</p>

<p>You realize that you don’t look any cooler by being racist.  Also, I know plenty of white people who sell runescape money.  Are sythe gold markets pervaded by Asians?  No, so shut the fuck up if you don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>

              <p>Frell, stop being biased. There are sweatshops in countries all across the world that played RuneScape. Jagex made a lot of cool things in RuneScape, they made the game more realistic and fun. However, they did it at the wrong time. They lost at least a fifth of their members and a huge chunk of their gold. (which is apart of their goal) However, the gold needs to drop even more for the economy to balance out. High Alchemy will not allow this to happen. Jagex also stopped all autoing possibilities, which will stop degrading the economy. A few more updates and RuneScape will be under Jagex’s full control once again. Time for legitimate players.</p>
