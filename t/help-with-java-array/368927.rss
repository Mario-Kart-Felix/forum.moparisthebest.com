    <description>ok ive did some googling. probably not hard enough, but i dont really know what i would search for. ok so in javascript an array like [code]SIArray = [[&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;some&quot;,&quot;other&quot;,&quot;strings&quot;],[20,13,62,0]];[/code] i believe would be possible. i dont believe i have tried it but i believe it works just with the thought that JS doesnt have you declare the the datatype of variables. would this also be possible in javascript because of the reason previously mentioned?[code]SIArray = [[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;],[2,&quot;hi&quot;,7,&quot;no&quot;]];[/code] if so how would i make this array in java? i was thinking i would have to have 3 or at least 2 separate arrays because they couldnt be in an array like that. is there a way to do that or not? and is there a better way than the way i am trying to do this? im trying to make an 2D or 3D array that will expand and is not constant(fixed). just now thinking if i made it a 2D string array but turned the ints to string(.toString()) for storage and when the iStrings needed to be an int again just turn it to an int(Integer.parseInt(aString);). thanks ahead of time for the feedback.</description>

              <p>ok thanks miss silabsoft. i was wonding if that would work. so if i use, <code>if(anArray[1][x] instanceof java.lang.String){
//do something
} else if(anArray[1][x] instanceof java.lang.Number){
//do something else
} else {
//that isnt a usable object
}</code>, that should sort through the array into what the variable need to be used. thanks for the help. if its a little confusing ill post up later what i am using this for. can probably promise its not going to be very good, since i dont have as much knowledge in programming as i probably should; but im learning, and wanting to learn better things, so if i show what i write up and get feedback i can make myself better.</p>

              <p>i want to make something like this in java. <code>SIArray = [["a","b","c","d"],[2,"hi",7,"no"]];</code> but when i was writing the question i think i found the awnser i was looking for. just truning the ints to strings. so i have a 2D String array.<code>String[2][4] s2DArray= {{"a","b","c","d"},{"2","hi","7","no"}};</code> what im doing this for, i probably could do an easier way but right now i dont know one. initially the array is going to be null and im going to add things to it that can be a string or int. and the position is important. like s2DArray[0][0] is equal to s2DArray[1][0]. my idea is the strings in the 1st D of the array is a variable name and the string value in the 2nd D is its assignment. this is for an idea i had. sorry if i confuse people. i just discovered again i need to refresh myself on the java syntax since i havent used it in a while–ill learn it better this time since ill actually read documentation(so I learn new and useful stuff while I refresh my brain) instead of just trying to learn it by looking at other peoples code and figuring out what it does(which isn’t exactly how I learned. I did read a little bit of documentation but I didn’t read nearly as much as I should of. I just read enough to get me by. I didn’t understand some of the things they were saying when I was 15, but I’m sure I will now).</p>
