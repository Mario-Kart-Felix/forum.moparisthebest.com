    <description>[center][u][b][size=18pt]Horizon[/size][/b][/u][/center]

What is Horizon? Horizon is a RuneScape private server based on Sanity&#39;s 317. This is a unique server due to the fact that I believe that RuneScape has two parts, Rune which is updates such as the SoF and Scape which is weapons, etc. If you haven&#39;t already understood, a good RSPS will have two parts, a Rune side, unique to the server, not copying Jagex, and a Scape side, implementing basic RuneScape features which made it the game we all know and love.

Well, what can we do to the Rune side?

Lets start visually. Sprites, if I edited every sprite, you wouldn&#39;t know it was a RSPS. Crowns, skill symbols, options, etc will all be altered to make the game unique but still resemble RuneScape.

What can we do in-game?

Lets start in combat, arguably the best part of RuneScape. Why should people hit each other one after another? Why cant a player with a higher agility level attack twice, before the other person etc. 

Skills? Attack will be changed with Intelligence, all Attack acts for is wielding and accuracy. If you are intelligent you can wield items and you can be accurate. The new skill will also account for things such as critical hits, a new feature to Horizon, and immunity, another new feature. All of these things will be explored as the server progresses.

Shops? No such thing. You may look at me as if im crazy, however when the first player logged in to RuneScape, did they go and get 500k off their mate? No. They went mining and made their own armour and weapons and progressed from their.

XP Rates. This, as well as accuracy etc will revolve around your intelligence. If i&#39;m clever i can get 5 circles out of a piece of A4. If im not i can get 4. If im clever i can get 1k XP, if i&#39;m not, less.

How do i train my intelligence? The longer you spend online, the higher your intelligence.

I could write 50 pages on my new, revamped game, but i shall leave you with this and I will add media very soon.</description>

Maybe add a “speed” element into the combat system that can be altered instead of the agility. I know this sounds nerdy, but kind of like Pokemon. If your speed is higher you can attack first, or twice in a row. Just an idea.<br>

              <p>I like your idea of players with higher non combat skills (agility and such) having the ‘upperhand’ in pvp combat I guess you could say. I hope you don’t quit this, I see some potential here. Feel free to private message me with any issues, I’m always open to help.</p>
<p>Edit: Read the topic a little more, @ your sprite changing idea… that’s totally fine just don’t color is so much you end up with a clusterfucked rainbow gameframe. Also, I like your logic of Rune and Scape representing the two parts of a RSPS.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I like your idea of ‘immunity’ and new skills, I hope to see something usefull come out of that. (Perhaps immunity could increase your defence against special skills such as barrage, special attacks, and so on.)</p>
<p>P.S. Sorry for all the edits, I’m just reading the post one bit at a time so I can further understand each part.</p>
<p>Last Edit: About your idea of intelligence being gained from ingame time, make sure to make an AFK logout timer so people can’t just afk and increase their intel overnight.</p>
