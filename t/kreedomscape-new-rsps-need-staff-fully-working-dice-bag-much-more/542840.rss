    <description>Hello there 
Kreedomscape is a brand new RSPS, put online only yesterday. On our first day, we managed to get 7 players online ! We&#39;re a friendly community who is looking for new staff and players, we&#39;re doing a special offer so that when you join, you get one item of your choice! (No rares like phat, can only be like a godsword, chaotic or anything else). We&#39;re not like other servers, our everyone in our community will treat you with respect, and we dont have the over used edgeville home, but we added a twist and made it in kajarma  It&#39;s good, trust me! 
Kreedomscape, unlike most insidiax sources is not leached. We took the origonal insidiax base and we are working on it, our coder needs some help too since he&#39;s not an expert coder, but he is good. We do not have a staff team, so it&#39;s up for grabs! Heres the list as of 17:38 06/05/2014
Owner-Jamie
Co-Owner Faris
Admins - None!
Moderators - None!
Here are some of the features we have in our server, not all, but some 
Dueling (Still working on a bug)
God wars dungeon (FULLY working, tele straight to boss)
Many different shops at home
Yell command for donors +
KBD
Nomand
Full vesta and statius available in shops
Player owned shops
24/7 hosted
Fully working barrows
Pest control
Tzhaar
Fully working PK&#39;ing
Easy to switch prayers and spell books
Owner and co-owner on alot so you can easily get help
AND MUCH MUCH MORE! 

Unfortuantley, I cannot upload pics due to problems with my PC, but the link to the webclient and downloadable client is www.kreedomscape.weebly.com
