    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-more-pk-points-per-kill/409439</link>
    <description>Well i&#39;m having one PK-point per kill which is very slow due to items in the PKP shop being fairly high,
And i&#39;ve been keep looking for the code that i should change but with no results, also google isn&#39;t solving my problems too.

So i&#39;ll hope you know about PI and stuff like this so you can help me out.</description>
