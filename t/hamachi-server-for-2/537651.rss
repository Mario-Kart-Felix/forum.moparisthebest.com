    <title>Hamachi server for 2?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hamachi-server-for-2/537651</link>
    <description>Is there any way to run a Hamachi server using my own 317 client and server files? A friend and I would like to play on a home-run server and I don&#39;t have a router/modem so that&#39;s why I have to use Hamachi. 

I&#39;ve looked up a few tutorials on how to set up an RSPS with Hamachi but so far they have all involved using a new client/server source to function properly. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve found a very nice 317 client and server source that is perfect in my opinion, but I have no idea how to make it public for anyone else to join using Hamachi.

I&#39;ve also gone into client.java and changed the &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; lines to my Hamachi IP, compiled, and sent the Client folder to my friend, but he was not able to join despite being in my Hamachi network. Again, I have no idea if that is supposed to do something, I just read it on one of the tutorials I came across.

If anyone knows how to use your own 317 client/server source and make it open to join via a Hamachi network, I would be very grateful if you could post a detailed explanation or link to me where such an explanation can be found.

Thanks.</description>

Search a Hamachi-compatible client, commonly used are clients with a built-in ip changer, which mostly supports hamachi’s network too. But i still would recommend you using no-ip.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, unfortunately all the Hamachi-compatible clients I come across change the desired gameframe and interface that I want to use for the server. It may seem trivial, but that’s just the client I want to use. I’m really wondering whether or not it is possible to use <span class="bbcode-b">my own client</span> and get the server working with Hamachi.</p>
<p>Also, I’m not sure if this is of importance, but whenever I run the server, it gives me this line:</p>
<p>Starting  on /0.0.0.0:43594</p>
<p>The 0.0.0.0 is sending up a red flag for me, because I would expect the server needs to run off of my Hamachi IP rather than that blank IP. I’m not sure that it’s of relevance though, just something that caught my eye.</p>
