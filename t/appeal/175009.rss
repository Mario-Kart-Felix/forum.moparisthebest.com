    <description>Will be lengthy, I am bored and want to tell the story...

Well, some time ago, My brother got hold of my password, and my lvl 80 account with almost 90 fishing and a total lvl of like 1.2k got two marks on it, one was rule one, one was rule eleven. Don&#39;t remember exactly what happened but i think he appealed the one, i got on later and no one would answer me, I eventually checked the appeal thing and found the other offence, rule eleven, advertising a private server, was my first 2 black marks, and i had 9.5 of 10 points on my account, a perm mute and ban from the forums, so I tried to appeal, and they auto replied with &quot;We have sufficient evidence that you were in control of the account...&quot; Well I quit for awhile, played some after that, got my combat to lvl 90 and my total lvl to like just under 1.4k, and then I realized that i could never max my cooking, because the top like 15 people had the max xp, so i gave up. I recently came back, my membership had expired and my account was unaccesable, i checked the recover a locked account and it didn&#39;t work, it said i did not need to recover it. 

I sent a message and they told me i would have been alerted in the offense thing, So i logged in there and I had 10/10 marks, no new offenses, but the rule eleven offense was appealable, so i have no idea why but it looks like they gave me another chance, i just said sorry and said that it was my brother, he used the same pc as me (my moms) and that he could never do it again and that i am a nice player and it would never happen again.

I am waiting on the appeal, and I guess my real point of this post was cause of boredom, but also because I was wondering what would cause them to allow me to appeal again?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 21, 2008, 07:07:32 AM[/size][hr]Update on that... Apology accepted, You apologized and said that it will never happen again, we are happy about this but the offense still stands. Looks like my account will forever be muted un justly....</description>

              <p>your probably still going to be banned. Whenever you say sorry it doesnt really do anything because that shows them that you are probably lying and were in control of the account.</p>
