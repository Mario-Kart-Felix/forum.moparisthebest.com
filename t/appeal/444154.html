        <p>I’d like to take the time to make a public appeal for the actions of somebody that some of you may know, his name is <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=374318" data-bbcode="true">Adam</a> (also known as SCAPE-JAVA). Before you read any further, note that this took quite some time out of my schedule so I expect responses that took quite some time to formulate.</p>
<p>I’m sure you all know that Adam became a moderator at a very young age. He was an excellent programmer, and he did his job just as well as any moderator at the time, despite being much younger and much less mature (note that I’m not referencing maturity through age, but that I was very close friends with him from 2009/10 onwards).</p>
<p>He was banned more than half a year ago over a harmless prank. Obviously there is something wrong with hacking someone else’s website, but note that this happened just after he’d been backstabbed by several people (will not name names, they know who they are) and been stripped of his moderator position.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s obvious that he did something wrong, but there’s no reason for him to still be banned. AMERIKA did the same thing as SJ (a long time ago), and was given <span class="bbcode-u">several extra chances</span>. I guarantee you that if SJ is given those extra chances, <span class="bbcode-u">he will not mess up again</span>.</p>
<p>Atleast consider the posibility of letting him back, he would be an excellent re-addition to the community.</p>

<p>I posted this here because no rule prevents it, and more importantly it can be assessed by the entire staff team (and not just by a few people).</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

        <p>I think it is fair to, in the very least, express that one of our reasons for not unbanning him right now was his lack of being able to keep his own account secure. His account had been shared multiple times and that is not something we take likely, especially as an ex-moderator.</p>
