    <description>On my account lostmyphat I have been unjustly banned for months. I was banned for multiple accounts, and I only had the account lostmyphat. I have figured out that I got iped because I logged onto my account at my friend&#39;s house, who also has a Mopar account and created quite a hullabaloo in the help section. Also, he told me that he started to pm multiple users about giving him rep. HE created HIS account with his own email, his own ip, and I have only logged onto my account at his house 3 times max. I got iped because my account links to his ip from his house... how can this even happen if I have only logged in there a few times?  :confused: Even so, I don&#39;t see how this can turn out to be a complete ip ban from the website

More info: I tried getting unbanned months ago also, but failed because I didnt have the dates at which I logged on... Davidi said I needed those</description>

              <p>The reason I asked was because it was literally a few days after you allegedly went to your friends house that you were saying it, so I found it veryyyyyyyyy suspicious you couldn’t tell me the dates you were banned.</p>
<p>But it’s been long enough anyways and the multiple account rule has been more clarified, you can be unbanned.</p>
