    <title>Major Updates, Major help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/major-updates-major-help/346170</link>
    <description>Ok, so you guys have helped me get to were i am with my server. It currently has 400+ members so Thanks.

But now its time to do some updates (major updates) and remember, im OK with java but not great.

1.  Currently the whole world is PVP, How do i make it so NONE of the world is PVP and its pure just normal.
2. Currently the server has pickup codes, How do i make it so the SERVER NO LONGER has those boring stupid pickup codes and instead i will sell the items in the shops.
3. When someone tries to TRADE it says its been disabled, how do i enable it?
4. I have 3 commands that users can use that i dont want them to (::pure) (::master) (::tank), How do i remove them. Instead of letting users use them i am going to make training areas.
5. Currentlly NO SKILLS are working, how do i get thieving and a few others to work.

Thanks.

I will be online for a while, and will reply to and replys.</description>

2: Find <a>code</a>[/code] or whatever your command is in client.java, and change rights.<br>
3: It’s disabled, enable it in client.java<br>
4: In client.java, search: <code>        public void commands() {</code> and change the rights.<br>
5: Add them yourself or find tutorials on adding them.</p>
