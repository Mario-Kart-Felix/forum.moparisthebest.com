    <description>[center][size=36pt][b]Radiance[/b][/size][/center]

[b]Radiance is a 508 project. After browsing the forums I have noticed that there was not many 508&#39;s online and the source&#39;s and client&#39;s available for downloading had a lot of glitches. Also what is going to motivate me to continue this project is the fact that there is not any 508&#39;s online on mopar. The 508 sources I have seen were mainly pking and I am here to change that. The server will be based on economy where money is hard earned and the xp is low. Sound interesting? Good. This server is not for everyone. This server is not for people who love customs, fast xp, or easy leveling. Radiance is here to attract the audience that liked Runescape back in the day. The hard earned money and the time put in to leveling. We want to build a community of loyal players, not players that come and go.  When the server is released the server will have 35 exp to start with and as you improve on a skill and move up to the next thing such as oak logs it will raise 5 exp every time. So when you chop oak trees it will be 45 exp. Bosses will be hard to kill and will take a team effort or a lot of good Armour if you are going to do it solo. When the boss is killed the drops will be good but not good enough to kill the economy of the server. The pricing for shops will be similar to pricing on Runescape.[/b]

[center][b]This will be made into a fun server, and we will strive to form a great community! Various fun activities, Bosses to fight with friends, friendly staff and a ton of updates that fit the community&#39;s needs.[/b][/center]
