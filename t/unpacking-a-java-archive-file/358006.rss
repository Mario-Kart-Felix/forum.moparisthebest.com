    <description>[center][size=14pt]Unpacking a Java archive file[/size][/center]

A Java archive file is a file used to aggregate more than one file into one. Most software developers generally use the Java archive file to distribute Java applications or libraries, in the form of classes and associated metadata and resources. A Java archive file can also be known as a [i]JAR[/i] file.

[b]Requirements:[/b] A Java archive file, Java, WinRAR, a brain.

[b]Difficulty:[/b] 2/10.

You can easily unpack a Java archive file using WinRAR which can be downloaded [url=http://www.rarlab.com]here[/url]. Once WinRAR has been downloaded and installed you have the ability to extract the Java archive file by simpley right-clicking the Java archive file and selecting [i]Extract here[/i].

Another method to extract the Java archive file without using WinRAR is using notepad, open up the notepad and insert this command line.

[code]jar xvf FileName.jar[/code]

Hoping that you have your classpaths set and have download Java, this will unjar the file you have directed the command line to unjar.
