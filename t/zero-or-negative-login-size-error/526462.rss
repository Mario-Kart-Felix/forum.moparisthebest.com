    <title>Zero or negative login size error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zero-or-negative-login-size-error/526462</link>
    <description>For the past 3 days I&#39;ve been trying to fix this error, I don&#39;t know how this occured but it seems NONE of my players INCLUDING myself can get on. I checked my VPS and noticed it, So I checked my firewall and problem solved all possible solutions and nothing fixed it. Now I&#39;ve lost tons of players and my whole community to this weird error I can&#39;t manage to fix. I&#39;ve read that it is caused by your connection but I fixed that already. It has also been a issue with many when there buying things in the shop since it disconnects them off and they are not able to log back in. So it might be a problem with ShopAssistant also but I&#39;m not sure it is, Feel free to pm me for helping me or replying below. I&#39;m kinda a noob to so please don&#39;t troll a noob learning how to fix things like this :L. I do have Teamviewer if someone is interested in fixing it that way but please bring that to private chat only.... 

Here is a picture of whats happening. (I hide my IP but it was showing - This is a TrisidiaX V3 base also I&#39;ve been working on)

Lmao my Grammar is so bad.
Help me sooon! I still have a few loyal players :c I&#39;m not much a forum person and its rare for me to even resort to this.


ADD: Also got proof that this is a ShopAssistant issue also.

I reseted my ShopAssistant to a previous update, I&#39;ll see if that helps a bit.</description>
