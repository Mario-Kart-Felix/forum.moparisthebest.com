Runescape Classic Replica is a server that aims to be a complete replica of the original version of Runescape Classic, with the exception of subtile modifications (where as the experience rates are one of them). We wish to bring the Runescape Classic scene a quality server, that is stable and has the security level at top noch, further more bringing back the nostalgia of the gameplay. We have previously brought you Runescape Classic Replica back in 2012, which were a success however it stalled due to economy, which has been resolved at this point.

We feel comfortable with doing a full launch at this point, and we would highly appreciate that you as a player will report any given bugs, or missing features.
We will not introduce batched skills, as the original game did not have these, and as stated above, we intend to replicate the original game.

              <p>That is a sad history they have, but honestly I do believe that the players of the RSC Community wants a proper Replica, and there is already some of those custom servers out there.<br>
I personally have gotten tirred of other servers being brought to live, only to dissapoint me or others, and therefore I am creating this server along with Chaotic. We may eventually host polls that will be related to new content that is in the spirit of RSC, but at this given moment, making all the features and functions should be top priority first.</p>
<p>Please feel free to check out our server, if you’d like.</p>

              <p>After trying out the server and talking to the staff, It is definitely on par with any competitor replica that is currently online…</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by the rates either, for some reason they are surprisingly good once you get in game and start playing.</p>
<p>There is one major difference with this and RSCE, There are actual updates! Frequent ones too… Plus subs are cheaper. So far, I would definitely recommend this for people who enjoy low rate servers. (For me to say that, is a BIG thing… I usually hate replicas).</p>
<p>So be sure to at least give the server a shot, You will not be disappointed.</p>

              <p>I personally believe that I will be able to put the dedication and effort into making this community into a succesfull one, I do understand that it requires money to raise a new community, and that is something that I am willing to sacrifice. I understand that players gets frustrated that they have to start all over again, whenever they choose to go to another server, but how fun is it to be in one of those communities that are left to die even shortly after their launch?</p>

<p>Runescape Classic Replica is a server that aims to be a complete replica of the original version of Runescape Classic, with the exception of subtile modifications (where as the experience rates are one of them). We wish to bring the Runescape Classic scene a quality server, that is stable and has the security level at top noch, further more bringing back the nostalgia of the gameplay. We have previously brought you Runescape Classic Replica back in 2012, which were a success however it stalled due to economy, which has been resolved at this point.</p>
<p>We feel comfortable with doing a full launch at this point, and we would highly appreciate that you as a player will report any given bugs, or missing features.<br>
We will not introduce batched skills, as the original game did not have these, and as stated above, we intend to replicate the original game.</p>
