    <title>Seeking out experienced developers for my team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/seeking-out-experienced-developers-for-my-team/544890</link>
    <description>[b]About[/b]: We currently have a team of three people: One who deals with advertisement/marketing, one who deals with website/server integration, and a sever developer. We&#39;re currently looking for one more developer, preferably one who has experience running servers and know what players want to [b]see[/b] in one. Also being excellent at clients would be nice, but isn&#39;t needed.

We have the financial details secured and we can invest as much money as we need to into the server to get it to succeed. We want to create a server that will cater to players, and will create an interactive, enjoyable, long-lasting community. If you&#39;re looking for the same please reply to this thread or message me. Thanks.</description>
