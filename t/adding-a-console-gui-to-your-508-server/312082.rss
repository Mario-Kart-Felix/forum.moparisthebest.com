    <title>Adding a Console GUI to your 508 server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-a-console-gui-to-your-508-server/312082</link>
    <description>[b]Description:[/b] I&#39;m going to show you how to add a custon GUI console to a palidino-base 508 server.
[b]Difficulty:[/b] 4/10, depending on knowledge of Java programming constructs.
[b]Files Needed:[/b] Console.java, attached below.

[b]Step One:[/b] You should first download the attached file, Console.java, and place it in the folder which contains your Server.java and Engine.java.

[b]Step Two:[/b] Open Console.java and right at the top, change the package from &quot;palidino76.rs2&quot; to whatever package your Server class is in.

[b]Step Three:[/b] Open up Server.java and search for: [code]public static void main(String[] args)[/code]

[b]Step Four:[/b] Under the first brace of the method, add the following code: [code]new Console(&quot;My Server&quot;).setVisible(true);[/code]

[b]Step Five:[/b] Replace [u]&quot;My Server&quot;[/u] with the name of your server, but don&#39;t change the quotation marks. This will form the title of your console.

[b]Step Six:[/b] Open up &quot;run.bat&quot; or &quot;runserver.bat&quot; or the file that starts your server and change the code to: [code]@echo off
cd ../bin
start javaw &lt;path to Server class file&gt; &lt;server port&gt;
[/code]

[b]Step Seven:[/b] Change &quot;&lt;path to Server class file&gt;&quot; to the actual path to the Main Class, but leave .class off the end. Then, change &quot;&lt;server port&gt;&quot; with the port that your server will be running on.

Congratulations, you have just added a console to your server! Error messages will appear as red text in the console, and normal messages will appear gray.

If anyone wants any advice or information, please ask  ;).</description>
