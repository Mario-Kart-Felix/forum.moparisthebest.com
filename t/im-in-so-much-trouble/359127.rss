    <description>ok so i was running my server on my downstairs home comp, this comp my family uses. My older sister was on (she is 17) and she  was watching wat we were typing,cause i was on my laptop, well the server crashed and my friend got mad, i said my sisters on ill fix in a sec, he goes f&#39;in sara (my sister). f&#39;in is not a bad word idk why he said it but she flips out, tells my dad, my dad comes over (hes not into computers like i am) and he thinks my run server is a fricken virus, now im grounded cause wat my friend did, and that i apparently had a virus, and that i play the game too much. they mostly complain how much i play, which is like 3-4 hours in the morning just till i find somthin to do with friends, i don&#39;t play on weekdays, only weekends. just thought id share wat my days been like.</description>
