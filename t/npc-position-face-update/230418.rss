    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-position-face-update/230418</link>
    <description>Already asked this but lost the help i got from Roger i think so does anyone know what makes the npcs reset the facing position like every half sec after a few monsters were killed. What ive noticed is when a new monster respawns, all npcs reset their facing position normally south so ive looked thru countless shit and couldnt find anything so does anyone know were this is occuring?
