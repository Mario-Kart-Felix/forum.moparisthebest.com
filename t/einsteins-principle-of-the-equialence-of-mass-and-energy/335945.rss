    <description>ok bros this isnt a homework question im just a little bit confused

so i heard that nothing can go faster than the speed of light. does this include light itself?

if i had a fast rocket with headlamps on the front, would the speed of light relative to space increase, or remain at c? paraphrased, would the speed of light relative to the rocket decrease, or remain at c?

i would of thought that the light would now be traveling at the speed of the rocket + c. but because nothing can exceed c, does the speed of light relative to the rocket decrease? and does the mass of something increase due to e=mc^2?

if the rocket was somehow traveling at the speed of light, would the headlamps appear to be turned off to a random martian standing in front of the rocket?</description>

<p>This isn’t a religious principle, where everyone has their own opinion and you respect everyone’s opinion.<br>
This is a testable scientific theory about our universe, you can do better then opinion.</p>
<p>If you do the experiments, special relativity is right and what you just wrote is wrong. This isn’t people pushing their beliefs on you, it is a fact about our universe.</p>

              <p>yeah, as people have pointed out the rocket cant ever travel at c because it has mass. Only massless bodies can travel at c, in fact I’m not sure but I think c is the <span class="bbcode-i">only</span> speed at which massless bodies can travel.</p>
<p>One inspiration for Einstein in coming up with all this was asking the question of what would you see if you looked in a mirror while travelling at the speed of light? the solution to this riddle with special relativity is that you cant.</p>

<p>ok, so what if you held a camera in front of the lights with a stick. would the lights appear to be on? i’m now under the impression that they would after reading your post, because the light will still be traveling at c. is this speed of c relative to the rocket though?</p>

<p>so i heard that nothing can go faster than the speed of light. does this include light itself?</p>

<p>…</p>
<blockquote>if i had a fast rocket with headlamps on the front, would the speed of light relative to space increase, or remain at c? paraphrased, would the speed of light relative to the rocket decrease, or remain at c?</blockquote>
<p>one of Einstine’s postulates is that everyone observes light to be travelling at c, that means an observer standing still and an observer in the rocket would both measure the speed of light to be c.</p>
<p>It turns out there is nothing special about light in this. The significance is that there exists a maximum speed and all massless particles and fields travel at this speed in a vacuum. According to special relativity, if something could go faster then c it would lead to an effect happening before its cause. Also it would make some times become imaginary in the sense that they involve sqrt(-1).</p>
<blockquote>i would of thought that the light would now be traveling at the speed of the rocket + c. but because nothing can exceed c, does the speed of light relative to the rocket decrease? and does the mass of something increase due to e=mc^2?</blockquote>
<p>no, the rocket still travels at v, but the concept of length and time changes so that the light from its headlights still travels at c instead of c+v.</p>
<p>e=mc^2 arises because the energy of a body depends on its speed amongst other things, as our idea of speed has been changed due to Einstine’s postulate, our idea of energy must change too. When you do the maths, there is an extra term that doesnt depend on the body’s speed and it is equal to mc^2. The e in e=mc^2 only refers to the rest energy, that is, the energy of a body when it isnt moving.</p>
<p>e=mc^2 isnt anything special, its just that the media hyped it up 100 years ago when it was discovered and the hype has lasted until today.<br>
I think the phenomenon of time dilation and length contraction are more amazing, intriguing, awe-inspiring and more capable of creating a sense of wonder at the universe. Go to youtube if you have time and type in special relativity, videos are normally quite good at explaining this.</p>
<p>No experiment has been found where special relativity didnt work, it seems overwhelmingly likely that our universe really is like this…</p>

<p>mopman, help me out here. can you see what i’m getting at?</p>
<p>i’m a little drunk but ill try to explain again:<br>
light comes out of the headlights at the speed of c<br>
rocket moves with speed v in the same direction as the light<br>
question time: what is the new speed of light. is it v+c or still c?</p>
<p>if this question was for classical physics well below the speed of light the answer would be easy - it’d be just v+c. but all i’ve heard is that you can’t get faster than the speed of light, c, so a speed of v+c would not be possible.</p>
