    <description>Hey guys, i just have a quick question that would be very helpfull if someone could answer for me.. 

-Well I have a problem, on a 525 client that i have recently downloaded, I can&#39;t seem to find where the last ip address is located at.. Or 127.0.0.0, any ideas where it could be located at? I&#39;ve tried client.java and what not.. But other than that. I can&#39;t find it. 

Thanks Guys!
