    <title>Lex - The First 355 Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lex-the-first-355-server/374472</link>
    <description>Welcome, to the one and only development topic for Lex! What is Lex, you ask? Well, Lex is the very first 355 server, and soon-to-be the first far-developed C# server you&#39;ve seen. Currently it is being worked on by Jayden and myself and our main goal is to change servers altogether.

You see, a problem with the servers today is people edit code using Notepad. In-existent studies have shown that those who use an IDE have a hypothetical improvement. Sure, one can download Netbeans or Eclipse, but they are even more confusing than setting environment variables. Lord knows we&#39;ve had enough of that...

More commercial/professional and irrelevant text to pull you in...

Okay, onto serious stuff. Lex is pretty much done as far as ground basics go, which include all forms of updating and walking. What we want to do is get Lex to a point where someone can actually customize their server, which means it will have combat, items, etc... working fine. Then, thanks to you Blakeman#### (Sorry, I&#39;m too lazy to look up your name), we&#39;re probably going to go even further and make an old, old server. You know the kind I&#39;m talking about: Varrock Bank as a starting point, the training room being the safe area with the shops, and the wilderness everywhere else.

In terms of stability, it&#39;s very stable. In terms of [b]speed[/b] on the other hand... well, it&#39;s fairly decent. I wouldn&#39;t call it great because I&#39;m not good at networking, but it&#39;s a lot better than the servers out there today (~350MS player update cycle in a region of 500 players with packet processing still right-on... on my computer. Pentium 4 processor @ 2.4GHz and 2GB RAM. It was on localhost though, so these results cannot be too accurate). Here&#39;s how the system works:

A connection is received -&gt; The connection is queued until the previous connection, if there is any, has been fully processed. It then is handled to be logged in -&gt; If successful, the server searches for an open thread to put the player on (More on threading below) -&gt; On each cycle (not updating cycle), packets and other actions for the players in that thread are processed. -&gt;&gt; The update thread interrupts whatever is going on and updates the players. Everything does remain in sync so there isn&#39;t anything to worry about there.

The threading system is rather simple. There are objects I call PlayerThreads, which are threads that hold and process a certain amount of players. This is faster than one thread for all players and way more efficient than one thread for all players. Currently we&#39;re still playing around with how many players get put on each thread, but the above statistics were tested with 20 players per thread. If you&#39;re decent at networking and have experience, I&#39;d like a recommended number.

[b]Current Server Features[/b]
-Full player updating
-Player movement (Thanks to Hyperion&#39;s code. :))
-Full NPC updating
-Basic items
-Client is somewhat refactored (It is a 355, remember)

[b]To-Do[/b] - Oh my...
Well, this is too big to fill out. We&#39;re going to be using a lot of the code from our RSRemake project since it had a lot of features and the code was efficient, so things like shopping and banking won&#39;t take much time.

[b]Screenshots[/b]
I&#39;ve only got one here. It was taken last night before some of the bugs, including a memory leak and speed changes, were fixed.

The name blocked out is Jayden but the username he took was too embarrassing so I took it out :(

So ya, there it is. Oh, and I&#39;m pretty sure I posted a topic about this project a while ago with Fellixombc on the team, but we&#39;ve changed our goals and this time it&#39;s just Jayden and I.

Why do people still make 300-490 servers? Theres so many new clients and servers with better graphics and interfaces yet you all keep bringing up these old old servers that are seen too much, i fail to see why you guys do. Why don’t you start working on the newer servers and let these die? We really need some decent 508+ servers not coded by idiots.</p>
<p>Chances are you’re all going to flame the fuck out of me for saying this, but hey… it’s moparscape dood.<br>
[/quote]You’re an idiot. The reason for these “old server” is because we like to relive OLD RS, not the bullshit that RS is now<br>
[/quote]You’re calling me dumb? relive what? shitty graphics? do you guys jizz yourselves over a terrible game? you do know you can custom any source to the way you want, following the old regulations on the new servers isn’t hard.<br>
No offense, but stop making these servers we got enough of them.[/quote]Ok well I guess you joined in 2010, I feel sorry for ya</p>

<p>Instead of ranting that 508+ servers are made by idiots and they suck, why dont you try to contribute and improve them yourself?</p>
<p>Not to mention the 400- clients are by far the most customizable.</p>

Okay, so ground items are now 100% done - this includes ground item ownership with delays for appearing for everyone else. Other global ground items work as well - both picking up and dropping. Next, onto shopping! Should be finished tonight.</p>
<p>EDIT: I forgot I had planned on going to bed earlier tonight due to a party tomorrow, so shops have only been started. Oh well.<br>
[/quote]With ground items, you should pickup the item 600ms after clicking if on the item, or 1 square from the item, if you are &gt; 1 square away, then wait until the player goes to the item, if the player uses the walking packet before going to the item, then stop the action. If the item is on an object (excluding type 22, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) then play the take animation.[/quote]Already works like. Same with NPC actions and object actions. Except with those ones it performs the action if the distance is &lt; 3 or 4. However I still have to make it so if the player cannot reach the area it says “You cannot reach that.”, which I totally forgot about.</p>
