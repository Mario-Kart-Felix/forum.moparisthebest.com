    <title>Am I paranoid or on to something?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/am-i-paranoid-or-on-to-something/429913</link>
    <description>[tt]&gt;CIA/FBI knew of 9/11, let it happen.
&gt;A never-ending, un-winnable war created to combat terrorism; a distraction and excuse to limit personal freedoms.
&gt;Patriot Act enabled government to spy on their citizens and the rest of the world.
&gt;National Defense Authorization Act passed to make the CIA&#39;s actions of assassination and indefinite detainment legal.
&gt;SOPA/PIPA plowed through congress to censor media by the government and corporations with the excuse to stop online piracy, yet the government already has the means to do so (see Megaupload)[/tt]

So, yeah - am I paranoid or am I smelling the smell of fascism in America coming in the near-future? Discuss.</description>

</aside>
<p>gun politics in great briton are a funny thing, from the 60s to 80s semi automatic weapons and the such were allowed (although personal defence has never been a valid reason unless under rare circumstances), the first major ban on guns was in the 80s effectively banning everything but pistols and long barrel shotguns, the second ban was in 1997 which banned pistols and tightened the permit for long barrel shotguns</p>
<p>both bans in gun ownership were triggered by a massacre where the gunman obtained his weapons legally, had these events not happened, the laws and more importantly the public’s opinion on guns might have ended up a little more lax</p>
<p>fun fact: northern island is the only part of the uk where guns are legal and use for self defence is a valid reason for owning a gun</p>

<p>They definitely aren’t good things, anything, no matter how slowly, that encroaches on our freedom is bad.  But fascism in the near future?  I doubt it for one sole reason.  All countries in the past that went that route, […]Nazi Germany[…] Before they went too far at all they took away all of the citizen’s guns, supposedly for their safety of course.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re wrong, and I wonder who gave you this piece of false information. The Nazi government didn’t take away guns from their citizens. They actually encouraged their citizens to own guns. The only regulated handguns.</p>
<blockquote>The first important revision in the 1938 law concerns the scope of the gun control regulation regarding the need for an acquisition permit: whereas the 1928 law regarding the acquisition or transfer of guns applied to “firearms and ammunition,” which included any and all “weapons from which a bullet or a load of pellets may be driven through a barrel, by means of the development of an explosive gas or air pressure” i.e. rifles, shotguns, handguns, etc.—the 1938 law applied only to “handguns.” In other words, the 1938 revisions completely deregulated the acquisition and transfer of rifles and shotguns, as well as ammunition.</blockquote> Source: BERNARD E. HARCOURT: HITLER AND GUN REGISTRATION
<p>This essay goes on about other revisions of the gun law in Germany. Although handguns were regulated, a hunting licence was enough to own a handgun.</p>
<p>You’re talking out of your ass, MITB. I find it appalling that you use arguments to shock people and get them on your side, when they are completely false to begin with. Is this normal in the US? Do you Americans just come up with outrageous arguments, trying to picture a dystopian future, hoping no one will check the validity of your arguments? Rick Santorum did the same a few weeks ago, when he talked about euthanasia in the Netherlands. He was spewing nonsense, just like you are doing.</p>

<p>I never said that, and I don’t think it.  But there should always be some healthy skepticism of any government, otherwise people become too complacent and then bad things do happen.  Only an idiot would blindly assume his government always has his best interest in mind, right?</p>

Before they went too far at all they took away all of the citizen’s guns, supposedly for their safety of course.  Same as Australia and Britain did not too long ago.
